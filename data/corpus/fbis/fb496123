  [Text] As I said a moment ago, today's convening of the 
parliamentarians has been postponed or canceled. Senator Clark 
Parent raises the question of security. 
  [Begin recording in Creole] [Parent] Well, I do not believe 
it even reached the stage of postponement because it had not yet 
been convened, because safety ... [pauses] a lot of other things 
are taken into consideration ... [pauses] because it is ... 
[pauses] we are experiencing coup d'etat logic and ... [pauses] 
I think these are the reasons. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Sen. Parent, do you think this 
session will be possible within the next few days, given that 
many parliamentarians are already on vacation? 
  [Parent] Well, I believe the vacation period will end 
between 
now and 13 June. The vacation period will come to an end and the 
Chamber of Deputies will return to work. Its vacation will come 
to an end and everything will return to normal. 
  [Correspondent] Do you not believe, nonetheless, that there 
will be opposition toward the unofficial office? 
  [Parent] Do you mean the office of Bernard Sansaricq or ...? 
  [Correspondent, interrupting] That is it. 
  [Parent] Well, I think a time will come, a time when the 
country can no longer carry on with this demagogy. I do not 
think the country can carry on indefinitely while a small group 
of people holds the country hostage, preventing the people's 
choice from being respected. [end recording]

  [Text] The Jonassaint government will not allow the 
reformation of the VSN [Volunteers for National Security] corps. 
Minister of Information Jacques Saint-Louis recalled that the 
VSN corps was dissolved by the government of General Henri 
Namphy and the dissolution decree is still in effect. But he 
says he understands some people's fears about a foreign 
intervention. Rothschild Francois Junior met with the minister 
of information. He has some details: 
  [Begin recording] [Francois] The Jonassaint government 
opposes the formation of a new paramilitary corps in Haiti. 
Questioned about the return of the VSN to the political scene, 
the minister of information explained that the Armed Forces and 
the police are the only armed corps authorized in the national 
territory. Jacques Saint-Louis stated, however, that he 
understands the attitude of some sectors of the population in 
the face of threats of intervention, which weigh on Haiti. The 
minister of information stressed that patriotism under attack 
requires more social and republican discipline. 
  [Saint-Louis] We consider that this attempt to bring back 
this corps dissolved by decree, dated, I believe, in 1986 by the 
government of Gen. Namphy, is a manifestation of people being 
under attack and feeling threatened; while an American 
intervention is being considered, it is quite normal for people 
feel the need to organize themselves. A decree was written, 
however, in that respect for the dissolution of this corps and 
we, as the government, do not intend to take a step backward by 
authorizing another armed corps, parallel to the Haiti Armed 
Forces and the police. 
  [Francois] If there is pressure from the Volunteers for 
National Security, would you reconsider this decision? 
  [Saint-Louis] It is out of question. The Constitution is 
clear on that. Only the Armed Forces and the police remain the 
armed corps. We count on the population, however, in the sense 
that the population remains mobilized so that if need be, we can 
call on the people to assure together the defense of national 
sovereignty. 
  [Francois] Questioned on the press releases recently issued 
by the government regarding some provisions of the Penal Code -- 
an initiative which has provoked many negative reactions -- the 
minister of information of the Jonassaint government defended 
himself by explaining that the government only wanted to make a 
point of recalling that those laws exist. 
  [Saint-Louis] It is just a reminder. You know that with the 
threat of an intervention, people [word indistinct] and do not 
know exactly what attitude to adopt, etc. I then thought that 
it was necessary for the Ministry to recall that there are [word 
indistinct] regarding those questions. 
  [Francois] Mr. Minister, some sectors accuse your government 
of wanting to establish a dictatorship in Haiti. 
  [Saint-Louis] We do not intend to establish a dictatorship 
in Haiti at all. We have a very specific mission and we are 
going straight to elections. We have some constitutional 
deadlines to achieve and we make it a point of achieving them. 
[end recording].

  [Text] The government of provisional president attorney 
Emile Jonassaint has officially banned the members of the 
resigning government of Mr. Robert Malval from leaving the 
country. In a communique issued on the night of 30 May, the 
Ministry of the Interior asked the state employees and 
government members not to leave the country before providing 
explanations about their management of the public coffers. A 
formal order has already been applied in that regard at the 
border posts in order to block the travel of the people affected 
by those measures. No reactions to the measures have been 
recorded from the standpoint of the resigning government of 
Robert Malval. The resigning prime minister was supposed to 
leave the country at the beginning of this month in order to 
participate at the OAS General Assembly on 6 June in Belem, 
Brazil. 
  We have learned today from the cabinet of Mr. Malval that he 
had decided not to go to Brazil after all, feeling that after 11 
May 1994 his place is in Haiti along with the Haitian people and 
standing before the usurpers of the legal power -- unquote [no

  [Text] The central bank, the Bank of the Republic of Haiti, 
has frozen nearly 15 million Haitian dollars belonging to the 
resigning government of Mr. Robert Malval. The funds, which 
have been blocked since the arrival on the scene of the 
provisional government of attorney Jonassaint, are for social 
and humanitarian programs. It should be noted that this money 
was provided by the U.S. Agency for International Development 
[USAID] and was aimed at financing USAID humanitarian projects 
and food and work programs for the impoverished.

  [Text] Engineer Franck Pierre, secretary general of the 
Capois Lamort Organization of Haiti [OCLH], has called for a 
state of siege. Pierre wrote Lieutenant General Raoul Cedras, 
commander in chief of the Haitian Armed Forces [FADH], demanding 
the state of siege and calling for the president of the Republic 
and Parliament to declare a state of siege to prepare for any 
possible provocation in Haiti. The current political sphere of 
influence continues to tear Haiti's social fabric and has led 
the country to a fatal deadlock, clearly threatening our 
national sovereignty with the military intervention of foreign 
powers known as Friends of Haiti. 
  The OCLH can in no way remain indifferent and idle during 
crucial points in the nation's life and has decided to save and 
defend our national independence. The OCLH earnestly and firmly 
asks the FADH high command: 
  1) To order a state of alert at all military bases in the 
nine geographic departments and to put the Army on alert; 
  2) To call up all officers, noncommissioned officers, and 
retired soldiers or those who were declared unfit for service in 
the FADH; to restore to the ranks of the FADH all former 
officers, noncommissioned officers, soldiers, tacticians, 
technicians, and others who were dismissed from the various 
corps, including the navy, infantry, artillery, training camp, 
aviation, and especially the elite corps that had been 
dissolved; that is, the Dessalines Barracks and the Corps of 
Leopards; to set up the FADH military high council immediately, 
composed of retired generals and colonels, to train and 
supervise the current High Command. 
  Engineer Franck Pierre is very firm about this. He demands a 
state of siege. The country will thus know it had been defended, 
explains Franck Pierre of OCLH. Forward! he cries to all 
Haitians and foreign nationals living on Haitian soil. Defend 
our lives and our interests in the face of the Haitian genocide, 
planned by foreign powers, that is coming. Up with a free, 
independent, sovereign Haiti, he exclaims. 
  It should be pointed out that the (Mais Gate) International 
Airport was reportedly under strict military control during the 
night of 30 to 31 May. We are awaiting further information from 
our colleagues on that issue.

<F P=106> [From the "Panorama Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] Herminio Blanco Mendoza, under secretary for 
international trade negotiations of the Commerce and Industrial 
Development Secretariat, appeared today before the Senate of the 
Republic to explain the content and progress of the free trade 
agreement signed by Costa Rica and Mexico. During his speech, 
the under secretary explained that the trade agreement will 
encourage investment and generate better paying jobs for 
Mexicans. The agreement, he said, will be particularly 
attractive to small- and medium-sized businesses. 
  When members of the Senate Trade Committee asked him about 
the current state of trade between Mexico and the United States, 
Herminio Blanco reported that Mexican exports to the United 
States totaled $4.2 billion and that Mexico's trade balance 
deficit is $83 million. Herminio Blanco described this as a 
fairly well-balanced bilateral trade relationship. The under 
secretary admitted that there are still a number of problems 
that need to be addressed. 
  [Begin Blanco recording] Obviously, paperwork and 
bureaucracy 
are always a problem because they reduce competitiveness. We 
have fought against this throughout the Salinas administration, 
but there is still plenty of work to do. In terms of the 
trade issue along the border, I must say there has been 
progress. There has been progress, and I am sure we can advance 
even further to allow border retailers to successfully compete 
against the large commercial chains on the other side of the 
border. [end recording] 
  He concluded by saying that Mexico cannot limit itself to 
trade with its North American partners. He announced that in 
addition to the free trade agreement signed with Costa Rica, 
other agreements will be signed in June with Colombia and 
Venezuela, and that Mexico is currently involved in negotiations 
with Bolivia, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. 
This will give us access the entire Central American market 
with its 30 million inhabitants and $7.8 billion in total 
imports.

<F P=106> [Article by Jorge Witker: "NAFTA: Some Practical Indicators"] </F>
  [Text] Four months following NAFTA's entry into force, the 
northern border offers some negative indicators that contrast 
with the acceleration processes being currently implemented by 
the government in the tariff and financial areas. The northern 
border, where a de facto economic and commercial integration is 
supposed to exist, constitutes the practical scenario to show 
the advantages of the commercial agreement in a natural and 
everyday manner. 
  In Chihuahua, however, the situation appears to be the same, 
at least in regard to regional exports from the state to U.S. 
markets. Despite everything, as far as imports are concerned, it 
is possible to find in the supermarkets a variety of U.S. 
products that are being sold without Spanish labels and even 
foods with expired dates on them. Is the Mexican Customs 
opening in keeping with the "free flow of foods" that is being 
promoted by NAFTA or is it simple premodernistic [premoderno] 
smuggling. 
  As for Chihuahua's exports, there is discouragement and 
disappointment. Apple producers who process the fruit and sell 
it as concentrate or syrup must, before every shipment, wait for 
lab tests in order to introduce their product. The product is 
kept by Customs for days, which entails additional expense since 
apples are a perishable product. Apparently, the elimination of 
nontariff barriers has not reached the U.S. Customs officials 
yet. 
  Another case in point is that of a renowned producer of 
Mexican bread and tortillas, which are exported to the United 
States. To preclude surprises in each shipment, he asked that a 
customs office be set up at his plant where compliance with the 
rigorous U.S. health requirements is documented, verified, and 
certified. Despite this, tortilla shipments and exports are 
stopped and sent for lab tests, thus delaying and raising the 
Mexican exporter's operating costs. 
  In addition to these protectionist examples, typical of U.S. 
praxis and insensitive to NAFTA, there is a very significant and 
well documented "free trade" experience. An executive of a 
business association or chamber accompanied by Mexican and U.S. 
notaries tried to determine levels of bias and ambiguity among 
U.S. Customs officials. For this purpose, he bought several 
gallons of U.S. milk (the milk sector of the state refuses to 
let go, despite efforts by the sector's industrialists via 
subsidized imports and official policy). He shipped it and 
imported it into Mexican territory. Subsequently, he switched 
the packaging (not the containers) and replaced them with others 
that had Mexican labels. When the same milk was exported to the 
United States, Customs officials stopped the shipment and 
conducted the lab tests that have become customary for Mexican 
perishables. The milk was rejected because it yielded negative 
results (unhealthy bacteria and foreign objects). How can one 
interpret this Customs behavior that milk producers have 
documented with Mexican and U.S. notaries? 
  In sum, the cases described have nothing to do with promises 
of "clear and objective regulations for permanent access to the 
national exports" that were used to justify this national 
decision to sign and approve NAFTA. 
  Therefore, before further lowering tariffs and beginning the 
new opening for the announced banking services, the government 
should demand the effective dismantling of nontariff 
restrictions because thus far, neither commercial reciprocity 
nor NAFTA have reached Chihuahua's border.

<F P=106> [Report by Miguel Angel Ortega] </F>
  [Text] International gunrunning is inundating Mexico. As 
if we were a nation at war, 20,000 AK-47 rifles -- the lethal 
goat's horn -- $12 million worth of them, are being shipped to 
our country from the United States. 
  In February, U.S. military intelligence alerted its Mexican 
counterpart about a shipment of 2,000 AK-47 assault rifles which 
are part of a larger shipment of more than 20,000 rifles. These 
weapons could already be in Mexico. 
  One expert who was consulted said the shipment "could supply 
the largest irregular army ever seen in contemporary Latin 
American history." Military authorities, however, ruled out the 
possibility that they are linked to a new insurgent movement. 
  EL FINANCIERO gained access to a report the Defense 
Secretariat sent to Government Secretary Jorge Carpizo McGregor, 
noting that "a reliable source" alerted the Mexican military 
attache in Washington about an "upcoming shipment of 2,000 AK-47 
assault rifles which was to be sent from the United States to 
Mexico." 
  Classified as urgent and secret, dated 8 February, and 
received at the Government Secretariat at 1559 on the following 
day, the military report stated: "The arms shipment is 
presumably part of a larger shipment of as many as 20,000 
similar weapons. The weapons' destination is Guerrero State, 
but it is unknown whether part of this contraband has already 
entered Mexico or whether it is in the process of entering." 
  The report noted that in Guerrero State, "mainly in the area 
of La Montana and Costa Chica, certain events have occurred to 
raise suspicions that drug trafficking and criminal activity in 
general might be confused with a subversive movement that is 
blossoming." 
  A copy of the Defense Secretariat communique, which was 
assigned the number 6454 and addressed to the government 
secretary, was also sent to the former Attorney General Diego 
Valdes; Jorge Tello, the current director of the Center of 
Investigation and National Security; Francisco Gil Diaz, 
assistant secretary of the treasury and public credit; and to 
Mario Ruiz Massieu, the current assistant attorney general. The 
report added that the arms might be shipped inside containers. 
  According to a military expert consulted by EL FINANCIERO, 
comparable rifles wholesale for $600 apiece in the United 
States. This means the first shipment's value is estimated at 
$1.2 million, and the entire shipment would be worth at least 
$12 million. 
  The communique also stated that the Guerrero State 
government 
"has already taken appropriate steps to increase vigilance among 
the public security forces." 
  In conclusion, the Defense Secretariat asked the government 
secretary to gather information "to try to detect, in advance, 
the entry of this contraband, which could be introduced into the 
nation by land or sea and by any means of transportation, 
including the use of containers."

<F P=106> [Report by Rosa Icela Rodriguez] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday, when the Movement for Democratic 
Transition [Movimiento por la Transicion Democratica] was 
created, it was announced that it would support Cuauhtemoc 
Cardenas' campaign to conduct a democratic struggle to return 
the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) to legitimacy 
because it is currently being "held hostage by various 
factions." Initially, the movement is expected to include some 
100 PRD leaders and candidates for the Chamber of Deputies and 
Senate. 
  A document that served as a basis for a discussion at this 
meeting at PRD National Headquarters states that the government, 
with the support of the media, "has unleashed a smear campaign 
against Cuauhtemoc Cardenas and the PRD" -- a campaign to which 
"PRD followers have not known how to respond" because "the PRD's 
internal problems have hampered and to a great extent paralyzed 
its political activity." 
  The document recognizes that "today's prevailing political 
climate is one of division and confrontation," and what has 
caused this is the way candidates for deputies and senators were 
chosen -- "under the hegemony of internal factions that placed 
group interests above national interests, thereby seriously 
hurting internal stability and, moreover, hurting the party's 
ability to provide the people with solutions to resolve the 
country's great problems." 
  At the meeting, which was attended by PRD members Francisco 
Kuri, Gilberto Rincon Gallardo, Rene Arce, Arnoldo Martinez 
Verdugo, Cuauhtemoc Sandoval, and others, those in attendance 
criticized the fact that "the PRD structure has been overrun by 
interest groups calling themselves factions." 
  Likewise, they criticized the fact that "internal disputes 
have lacked political foresight, programmatic formulas, and 
tactics. But the most serious aspect of this situation has been 
the casting aside of PRD members who do not belong to any 
faction -- those who act separately within grass-root 
organizations in municipal and district committees." 
  They stressed: "This is not the image of the PRD that is 
sought or wished by those of us who have gathered together to 
form this movement" and who have "shared with a large sector of 
the party's grass roots our opposition to the methods and 
behavior of these groups, which have made hegemonic decisions at 
all levels of the party and have even placed at risk the 
organized activities of the Executive Committee and the National 
Council." 
  They continued: "In view of this situation, a group of us, 
all PRD members who took part in the party's founding and have 
devoted ourselves to the tasks of building the party and 
developing its policies and programs, have decided to form a 
group and become an instrument of political work within the PRD, 
and, in this way, we will fulfill the goals that our statutes 
establish."

  [Text] San Salvador, 1 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- U.S. President 
Bill Clinton seems to have knocked on the wrong door when he 
asked Central America to provide temporary shelter to hundreds 
of Haitian refugees because, according to what several Central 
American leaders are claiming, current conditions do not favor 
this option. 
  The presidents conveyed this position in San Salvador, where 
they are attending the inauguration of President Armando 
Calderon Sol. The leaders took advantage of the event to hold 
meetings and to draw up common positions in advance of upcoming 
international conferences, including the Ibero-American Summit 
which is slated to be held in Colombia in June. 
  Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina told the media that 
scores of Haitians are already in his country. According to 
Reina, these Haitians have been granted temporary asylum, have 
settled in the Atlantic region, and now "constitute a problem." 
  Reina told the media that Honduras "must defend its rights 
and options," and he added, "the refugee program has been 
distorted... it has become politicized." Reina explained: 
"Honduras has already welcomed Haitian refugees, who constitute 
a problem because they do not want to remain in the country or 
return to Haiti, and they are now demanding visas to go to the 
United States." 
  Honduras has already lived through the experience of 
providing asylum to thousands of Salvadorans and Nicaraguans who 
fled wars in their countries. All of these Salvadorans and 
Nicaraguans have since been repatriated. 
  Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro refused to talk to the 
media about her country's decision on the matter, but according 
to Central American politicians, it is obvious that the current 
political, economic, and social crisis in Nicaragua will prevent 
it from providing sanctuary to refugees because such a move 
would only exacerbate the domestic situation. 
  Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio noted that his 
country "is not in any condition to welcome" the Haitian 
refugees because, currently, there are some 45,000 Guatemalan 
refugees in Mexico that are now being repatriated. "We respect 
the self-determination of all people, and we uphold this 
policy," De Leon said in reference to the Haitian crisis. He 
also reiterated that Guatemala is in no shape to offer sanctuary 
to the Haitians because of the nation's economic and social 
situations. 
  De Leon added that there are areas in Guatemala where armed 
clashes between the Army and guerrillas are still taking place, 
and he added: "We would be making a mistake if we received our 
Haitian brothers under such harsh conditions." 
  A Salvadoran official recalled his country's difficult 
postwar situation, and he noted that it has not received a 
formal petition from the United States to accept any refugees. 
Miguel Angel Salaverria, the outgoing Salvadoran foreign 
minister, noted that the United States is seeking to obtain 
temporary shelter for the Haitians while it reviews the 
Haitians' reasons for leaving their country. He claimed the 
United States is doing this in an effort to turn back economic 
emigrants and to allow only political exiles into the United 
States. 
  Costa Rican President Jose Maria Figueres did not discuss 
the 
refugee issue in his statement to the media, and he is the only 
one who has not voiced opposition to the proposal. So far, 
according to a statement Figueres made last week, his country is 
reviewing the issue, which is now being negotiated with the UN 
High Commissioner for Refugees.

  [Text] San Salvador, June 1 (CNA) -- Republic of China 
[ROC] Premier Lien Chan attended the inauguration of Salvadoran 
President Armando Calderon Sol Wednesday [1 June] morning. 
  During the two-hour inauguration ceremony, Lien and his wife 
were seated as guests of honor next to other Central American 
leaders. 
  Calderon was named president of El Salvador under the 
witness 
of Salvadoran congressional leaders. After his inauguration, he 
delivered a 45-minute speech calling on his countrymen to help 
rebuild El Salvador, ravaged by 12 years of civil war. 
  After the ceremony, Lien met with Nicaraguan President 
Violeta Chamorro and Panamanian Vice President Guillermo Ford. 
  Meanwhile, during a television broadcast of the ceremony, a 
private El Salvador television station mistakenly aired a photo 
of the Communist Chinese flag alongside the photos of the ROC 
delegation. 
  The ROC Embassy in El Salvador immediately demanded an 
apology from the TV station. 
  Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Victor Manuel Lagos later 
apologized to ROC Ambassador Andrew Shen on behalf of El 
Salvador for the mistake. 
  Shen told CNA that the station also apologized for the 
mistake and agreed to make a correction during a news broadcast 
to be shown later in the evening. 
  Lien and his 21-member entourage will travel to Guatemala 
June 2 and is scheduled to return to Taipei June 7.

  [Text] San Salvador, June 1 (CNA) -- Premier Lien Chan said 
Wednesday [1 June] that he will visit New York for private 
reasons following his official visit to Guatemala. 
  This was the first time Lien publicly confirmed his New York 
trip. 
  Lien, heading a 21-member entourage, arrived in San Salvador 
Tuesday to attend the inauguration of the new Salvadoran 
president, Armando Calderon Sol. 
  Lien will leave here Thursday for Guatemala for a four-day 
visit. He will then proceed to New York for a two-day stay. 
  Lien told a group of Taiwan reporters after attending a 
cocktail reception given by Calderon that his New York trip is 
purely for private purposes. 
  "While there, I won't meet with any person except my 
children," Lien noted. Two of Lien's children are studying in 
New York. "I expect a happy family reunion there," he said. 
  Lien, who has a doctoral degree from the University of 
Chicago, said he visited New York many times while he was 
studying in the United States. "I have fond memories of that 
city," he added. 
  Lien's wife, who is accompanying Lien on his Salvador and 
Guatemala visits, will fly to New York along with Lien. Other 
members of Lien's entourage, including Economic Affairs Minister 
P.K. Chiang and Chairman Sun Ming-hsien of the Council of 
Agriculture, will return to Taipei after the Guatemala visit. 
  On his way to San Salvador from Taipei, Lien stopped in Los 
Angeles and Miami. Lien also made stopovers in the two American 
cities when he visited Honduras early this year. 
  Taiwan does not maintain diplomatic ties with the United 
States. For fear of offending Beijing, the U.S. Government has 
been reluctant to engage in high-level contacts with Taiwan. It 
only allowed Taiwan's President Li Teng-hui to make a short stop 
in Hawaii on his way to Nicaragua in May.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Salvadoran economic developments monitored through 31 
May. 
  Ruben Pineda, director of the Salvadoran Coffee Council, has 
reported that El Salvador has decided to release 130,000 
quintals of coffee it has been stockpiling since October 1993, 
when the Association of Coffee Producing Countries decided to 
begin withholding coffee to raise international prices. The 
coffee is now being released in the wake of higher international 
coffee prices and in keeping with a resolution issued by the 
Association of Coffee Producing Countries. (San Salvador EL 
DIARIO DE HOY in Spanish 25 May 94 pp 3, 37) 
  The Statistics and Census Directorate General has reported 
that overall inflation reached 4.1 percent in the January-April 
period. Increases in the price of homes and certain food items, 
such as beans and tomatoes, led to the overall increase. (San 
Salvador EL DIARIO DE HOY in Spanish 25 May 94 p 11) 
  A new banking institution called Unibanco has been set up 
with an initial capital of 50 million colones. The charter 
agreement was signed 25 May by local stockholders and a 
representative of the Hamilton Bank of Miami. Unibanco 
President Arnoldo Villafuerte said U.S. bankers contributed 12 
million colones to guarantee direct access to Hamilton Bank's 
international network. The bank will specialize in 
international trade. (San Salvador EL DIARIO DE HOY in Spanish 
26 May 94 p 12) 
  On 25 May, authorities from the Lempa River Hydroelectric 
Executive Commission (CEL) confirmed that beginning on 1 June 
the electricity rate will again be increased. CEL President 
Guillermo Sol Bang announced a 30-percent increase for housing 
units and an increase of as much as 66 percent for industrial 
use. (San Salvador Canal Doce Television in Spanish 0300 GMT 26

<F P=106> [Excerpt from news conference by Daniel Ortega, secretary </F>
general of the Nicaraguan Sandinist National Liberation Front, 
with unidentified reporters; place and date not given; from the 
"Events" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Ortega] We are accepting the democratic process 
within the bosom of the Sandinist National Liberation Front 
[FSLN]; in other words, we are promoting national democracy. 
The most important step was taken during the 1990 elections, 
and we are currently taking another giant step, because we are 
taking into account the 1991 elections when, during the First 
FSLN Congress, we voted for an entire slate of candidates to the 
National Directorate instead of voting individually. This 
situation sparked dissatisfaction. Now, for the first time, we 
have employed individual and secret votes, but we still lack 
democratic footing within the FSLN. This is shown by the 
articles that have been written since the results were released. 
  Imagine if those companeros who lost the elections would 
have 
spoken at the Olof Palme Convention Center and would have 
expressed their support for the process after learning the 
results of the elections to choose the Sandinist Assembly, the 
National Directorate, the Secretariat General, and others. 
Would this not have been a superb and beautiful situation? In 
other words, they should have done the same thing we did when we 
lost the elections. We accepted our loss, because accepting our 
loss meant accepting the democratic process. We matched our 
words with deeds. We did everything democracy dictated. Should 
I have failed to be reelected, or if should things should have 
failed to turn out the way I wanted them, then would there be no 
democracy? I believe their attitude is merely an antidemocratic 
action that questions democratic logic. 
  [Reporter] Commander, there seems to be leftist sectors that 
are pleased with the results of the FSLN Congress. They 
maintain that as a possible 1996 presidential candidate, you 
have a greater chance of winning than Sergio Ramirez does. 
Others, however, say you are more stigmatized than the renewal 
current because of your position in the 1980's. Do you have 
anything to say about this? 
  [Ortega] We are not forming candidacies here. First, if we 
believe in polls, the fact is that polls fail to show Ramirez 
will register a higher preference rating than me. This is a 
fact. However, this is not the principle that candidacies are 
built on. The fact that I have a higher preference rating than 
other companeros such as Sergio Ramirez shows there has been 
consistency over the years. Nevertheless, it is false that I 
have a higher rating than Sergio Ramirez. [sentence as heard] 
One thing is the image we project to the population. There 
were occasions when Mrs. Chamorro registered higher. But it is 
another thing when it comes down to whom the people intend to 
vote for, and here Mrs. Chamorro loses ground. The same thing 
happens with Dr. Ramirez: He has a high profile, but he also 
loses ground in the number of people who intend to vote for him. 
  I repeat that these are not parameters that will define the 
1996 electoral slate. I believe the parameters will be 
determined by a national unity program and platform the FSLN 
must present to the Nicaraguan people. At that time, we will 
introduce capable people who will head the slate, thereby 
guaranteeing compliance with the national unity program. This 
is why we are attempting to reach an understanding, an 
agreement, and even an alliance with the many socioeconomic 
sectors of our nation. In other words, we want to strike an 
alliance with producers, businessmen, and workers. Here, we are 
talking about COSEP [Higher Council of Private Enterprise], 
which is a very powerful sector within Nicaraguan society. We 
are willing to broaden our negotiations and exchange of ideas 
with COSEP and to reach an agreement to strive for our country's 
stabilization to ensure that a future government will indeed 
have a national consensus -- a consensus among producers and 
workers. 
  [Reporter] Commander, do you want to fire Carlos Fernando 
Chamorro? 
  [Ortega] Excuse me? 
  [Reporter] Do you want to fire Carlos Fernando Chamorro? 
  [Ortega] He has worked for BARRICADA for 14 years. I believe 
the main issue at stake here is that no one should cling to a 
post. I believe no one should hold any position forever. There 
must be a willingness to renew and strengthen FSLN 
organizations. However, we are not promoting a policy of firing 
anyone, and we are not firing anyone. 
  [Reporter] Are there any changes planned in the National 
Directorate? 
  [Ortega] This is not a topic we are currently discussing 
within the National Directorate.

<F P=106> [Report by Alvaro Alvarado from the "RPC Television News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] National Banking Commission [CBN] representatives 
have indicated that the CBN is still unaware of any specific 
measures the U.S. Government intends to take in terms of banking 
secrecy in Latin America. A proposal to implement such measures 
was mentioned during a recent meeting between representatives of 
the U.S. Government and the Andean Group member-states -- 
namely, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Colombia. The U.S. plan is 
designed to get Latin American nations to allow the United 
States to conduct all types of investigations into regional 
banking matters. 
  Meanwhile, CBN President Olga Arosemena de Guizado has 
indicated that current banking secrecy regulations in Panama do 
not pose any obstacles to such investigations. 
  [Begin Arosemena de Guizado recording] At this time, any 
duly 
authorized representative of a foreign government can come to 
Panama and officially request, through the relevant national 
authorities, an investigation into any crime without having to 
breach so-called banking secrecy rules. [end recording] 
  Unfortunately, according to the CBN president, any bank in 
Latin America can be used to launder money. The CBN is 
currently installing modern computer equipment that will allow 
it to better monitor deposits made in the country's banks. 
  [Begin recording] [Arosemena de Guizado] What we could have 
is a client who would go to one bank and deposit 5,000 [currency 
not specified], and then go to another and deposit another 
5,000, and so on, and so on. 
  [Alvarado] [Words indistinct] 
  [Arosemena de Guizado] In such a case, we would never know 
for sure whether this company is the same one that deposited the 
same amount in another bank. These kinds of situations could 
take place. [end recording] 
  The modern computer equipment currently being installed was 
donated by U.S. AID at a cost of $100,000.

  [Text] The Tierra del Fuego Province metalworkers' conflict 
has deteriorated to an even greater degree following the 
unexpected break in the negotiations and the entrepreneurs' 
decision to send telegrams warning workers of their dismissal if 
they fail to show up for work. Yesterday picket lines prevented 
the entry of workers to factories, and cut access roads to the 
industrial area. Metalworkers Union [UOM] leaders, meanwhile 
insisted: 
  "We will continue the strike to its last consequences. If 
the government or the police repress our activities we will 
answer back just as harshly." 
  The attempt to find a solution to the conflict between 
workers and entrepreneurs failed yesterday morning following 
eight hours of negotiations at the Labor Ministry. Last night 
entrepreneurs agreed to pay according to coefficient three 
[reference unknown], but gradually and over a three-year period. 
The UOM rejected the offer. The Labor Ministry then proposed 
reducing the period of implementation of the coefficient three 
proposal, and established a period, to be determined by 
compulsory arbitration, during which coefficient three would 
remain in effect. The UOM also rejected this offer. 
  Marcelo Sosa, UOM Ushuaia branch secretary general, 
explained 
the reasons for rejecting the entrepreneurs' proposal: "The 
offer presented by entrepreneurs is way below what workers want. 
The proposal is unacceptable." 
  Sosa announced that "the strike will continue until progress 
is made and until entrepreneurs rehire dismissed fellow 
workers." Sosa also criticized factory managers. He said 
managers' arguments "are arbitrary" and "the only thing they 
want is to wear out the determination of our fellow workers who 
remain on strike." Sosa also blamed entrepreneurs for "breaking 
the compulsory arbitration by dismissing 127 fellow workers." 
  The failure to find a negotiated solution generated strong 
tensions in the province almost immediately. Entrepreneurs sent 
2,500 telegrams warning workers to show up for work or face 
dismissal. In the morning, however, picket lines prevented the 
entry of workers who showed up for work. Philco and Sanyo 
personnel who showed up for work were transported in company 
buses to the plant for the first shift, which was to start at 
0600. But the group of workers who had been camping in front of 
the factory since the beginning of the strike surrounded the 
bus, shouting: 
  "Go back, strike breakers." 
  A second group of strikers cut the road leading to the 
industrial area and forced all other buses to return to the 
city. Company directors filed a complaint at the police 
department immediately afterward. Sanyo Industrial Director 
Fernando Nott said "activists organized their move hours before 
the buses went to pick up workers." Nott asked "the police and 
other provincial authorities to take the necessary measures" to 
guarantee "the safety of people who want to work." 
  At that hour the possibility of returning to the negotiating 
table to try to find a solution to the conflict looked 
impossible. Pedro Waisman, president of Tierra del Fuego's 
Industrial Union, commented: "The problem started as a labor 
and economic conflict, but it has now turned into a political 
and ideological problem." Waisman warned: "These activists have 
all been identified. The police and government must act 
immediately to reestablish social peace and permit workers to 
return to work on the island. You cannot work with strikers' 
picket lines threatening women and children and breaking 
everything." 
  Workers denied this statement. They denied "the existence of 
active picket lines," explaining: "Buses carrying workers gave 
up the idea of entering the factory zone because they considered 
conditions to be inappropriate for production." The UOM held a 
general meeting and decided to challenge the threats of massive 
dismissal and the possibility that the strike be declared 
illegal. They decided to continue their indefinite strike, which 
has already been in effect for 17 days. 
  Angel Valle, assistant UOM Ushuaia branch secretary general, 
said: 
  "We are going through a grave crisis. We need concrete 
government answers. The only thing the government has given us 
is repression." 
  In Buenos Aires, meanwhile, Labor Secretary Carlos Etala 
said 
entrepreneurs will be able to dismiss workers "with just cause" 
if they continue their strike. Etala said the dismissals "will 
be legal because the union disobeyed the order for compulsory 
conciliation, and did not return to work." The Labor Ministry 
has been delaying the decision to declare the strike illegal, 
despite the fact that it is technically able to do so, because 
it is trying to find a negotiated solution to the conflict. 
Yesterday Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo, Labor Minister 
Armando Caro Figueroa, Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf, and 
Presidential Secretary General Eduardo Bauza met to analyze the 
situation.

  [Excerpt] Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar Quiroga said 
yesterday in Sucre that the agreements between Bolivia and the 
United States are vital for the progress of the nation. He also 
promised that the new extradition treaty being negotiated with 
that country will be based on international law and sovereignty. 
  He said: "An extradition agreement with the United States is 
essential, because a country like ours cannot escape from 
international juridical cooperation at a time when 
interdependency is the signal in all fields." He explained that 
the new extradition treaty will be based on "mutual interests." 
  Aranibar was asked if during his administration there had 
been U.S. Embassy interference in the country's internal 
affairs. His answer was: "You (reporters) have as many elements 
for judgment as I do in order to evaluate that." [passage

  [Text] The Bolivian Armed Forces command yesterday reported 
on an alleged political plot against the military institution 
and denied that the high command and the executive branch are 
planning to "relocate" a large portion of its troops. 
  The Armed Forces issued a communique in which they warn that 
alien interests seek to discredit the high command and to create 
an appropriate climate to eliminate the institution. They assert 
that this will not be allowed to happen. 
  Information disclosed yesterday states that military and 
executive branch authorities, in complete secrecy, discussed the 
alleged plan to "drastically reduce" the number of troops and 
that this initiative is allegedly supported by the U.S. Embassy. 
  The alleged plan would have the financial support of the 
U.S. 
Government and would allegedly seek to convince officers and 
soldiers to accept a "voluntary retirement" through the payment 
of illegal bonuses, like the procedure used to "relocate" 
thousands of workers. 
  The Armed Forces command, after regretting the spreading of 
distorted information, states: "The military career is based on 
a strong professional desire to serve the nation, a task which 
is fulfilled with dignity, based on honor and respect, whose 
strength even contemplates sacrifice if circumstances so demand." 
  The communique adds: "In our capacity as the main 
protagonists for the creation of the fatherland, our fate is 
linked to that of the nation and no misinterpretation or 
political plot will threaten our existence because the Armed 
Forces' noble mission cannot be modified or distorted." 
  The Armed Forces communique continues: "Despite this 
concealed provocation, which has the evil purpose of 
discrediting the high command by accusing it of being aware of 
such an ignoble plan, we clearly state that we will loyally 
fulfill our commitment to preserve dignity and institutional 
integrity." 
  Admiral Julio Molina, the Bolivian Navy commander, minimized 
the press report, stating: "I don't know anything about a plan 
of this sort, moreover, that information is not explicit because 
it does not mention a source." 
  Molina added: "This sort of information must be investigated 
and documented by the media because if not it will cause unrest 
in any involved institution." 
  Other military high command sources stated: "The information 
is completely false and designed to cause problems for the 
government. It creates false expectations among officers and 
sergeants due to the irresponsible mention of alleged economic 
compensations. The military high command never discussed or 
talked about such a proposal." 
  More than two years ago the Armed Forces command ordered the 
compulsory retirement of some 600 civilians, which is the most 
recent rationalization of the military institution's personnel 
which, at that time, was interpreted as the beginning of a 
gradual process to establish "a smaller but more efficient and 
operative Armed Forces." 
  At that time the military authorities rejected rumors and 
justified the measure by pointing out "it was just an 
administrative measure that by no means represented the 
beginning of a process to purge military personnel." 
  FIDES NEWS AGENCY states that the U.S. Embassy has said that 
"the decision to determine the size of the Armed Forces belongs 
to Bolivia," and denied exerting any pressure to reduce the 
number of troops. 
  U.S. Embassy officials have stated: "The United States does 
not have any financial plans regarding an alleged reduction by 
paying Bolivian officials to retire." 
  The diplomatic authorities recalled that Barry McCaffrey, 
commander of the South Command headquartered in Panama, paid a 
protocol visit in March. When consulted about the reduction of 
the Armed Forces in Latin America, he answered: "I cannot 
imagine anything more unlikely. High-ranking U.S. leaders are 
aware that security in Latin America relies greatly on having 
Armed Forces that are strong, disciplined, subordinated to the 
civilian power, and that act within the framework of the law."

  [Text] Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar yesterday 
announced that President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada will travel 
to Colombia on 14 June to attend the Fourth Ibero-American 
Summit, which is to be held in Cartagena. 
  This will be the first time Sanchez de Lozada will attend 
this forum, at which 23 presidents and chiefs of state from the 
continent and Spain meet every year. The summit will last two 
days. 
  This year the main subject of the summit will be regional 
trade and democracy. The first meeting was held in Guadalajara, 
Mexico. Four years ago Bolivia was represented by Jaime Paz 
Zamora, who was president at that time. 
  Aranibar also announced that Bolivia will send a 
representative to an international meeting to be held next week 
within the framework of the OAS annual forum, where countries of 
the continent will assess the progress made in the struggle 
against drug trafficking and the cooperation between countries 
to face this crime.

  [Text] The Brazilian economy is achieving an breakthrough: 
It has recovered over the past seven quarters despite 
ever-increasing inflation which has doubled its monthly rate 
over the past 2 years. Through alternating short-term low 
periods and strong high periods, the economic activity has come 
out of the hole it dug in the third quarter of 1992, although it 
has not grown evenly and does not have a guaranteed future. 
  Economist from the most diverse backgrounds have stressed 
that this year the GDP will grow between 3 and 5 percent 
compared to 4.96 percent in 1993. The next president, who will 
inherit fiscal and monetary stability, will have to determine in 
1995 whether the process continues. The drop in production and 
sales that began last month is seen only as a "recessive 
splutter" by Antonio Barros de Castro of the Industrial Economy 
Institute of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. 
  Claudio Considera, director of the Applied Economic Research 
Institute (Apea), stressed that "the first quarter's figures 
surprised us." During the January-March period the GDP grew by 
4.3 percent compared to the same period in 1993 and could close 
the first half of the year at 3.6 percent. Some $25 billion was 
added to the economy in 1993, in other words, growth in Brazil 
is half as much as in Venezuela or Peru. 
  The start of a long-term growth cycle has not been confirmed 
by economists like former Central Bank President Alfonso Celso 
Pastore or Mappin Company President Carlos Antonio Rocca. 
Pastore said: "We do not see an overall warming: Some sectors 
have high growth while others have low growth; some sectors have 
strong demand while others have less demand." Rocca believes 
negative factors like low exports and high interest rates force 
the market down, thus counterbalancing positive factors like 
increases in investment. During the first quarter, the Ipea 
noted a rise last year in the Gross Development of Fixed Capital 
from 15.2 percent of the GDP to 16.2 percent. 
  "Growth is sustainable when there is investment," stressed 
Considera, a specialist economist in national accounts. Rocca 
added: "Foreign capital assets are growing at more than 20 
percent while private investment, like civil construction, is 
also growing." 
  Paulo Rabello de Castro, chief editor of the magazine 
CONJUNTURA ECONOMICA of the Getulio Vargas Foundation [FGV], 
said: "Recovery is a fact." Rabello de Castro has said that 
this recovery is due to the strength of the private productive 
system. 
  Investment must be attracted if this recovery is to be 
sustained. Today Brazil is investing some $74 billion, but to 
grow at 3.7 percent per annum another $30 billion per year is 
needed, and we must even try to surpass this sum of $104 billion 
per year, according to Economist Geraldo Gardenali, professor of 
the FGV-Sao Paul. He said: "These resources must come from the 
public sector in the form of increased efficiency and from the 
external sector." 
  Increased productivity was decisive for recovery. Maria 
Helena Zockhun, a researcher at the Economic Research Institute 
Foundation-University of Sao Paulo (Fiepe-USP), has said: 
"Industrial prices dropped by a real average of 3.2 percent in 
1993 when compared with 1992." Production per hour in Sao Paulo 
in 1993 increased by 11 percent.

  [Text] The record figures attained by industries like the 
car industry and the recovery of the house appliances industry 
are signs that the economy is progressing very well. "This 
year's performance is better than expected," said Roberto Caiuby 
Vidigal, president of the Confab [National Brazilian Steel 
Forging Company]. "For the first time in recent years the 
capital goods sector is registering an increase, and the 
continuation of this increase will depend on the next 
president," he added. 
  The idle capability of the capital goods sector is still 
considerable (nearly 46 percent) but the amount of new projects 
is also considerable: At the beginning of the year the Brazilian 
Association for the Development of Basic Industries (Abdib) 
estimated there were $38 billion worth of investment projects 
requiring capital goods, engineering services, construction, and 
assembly. An Abdib bulletin released this month states: "From 
the first quarter of 1993 the investment rate and percentage 
variation of Fixed Capital Gross Formation [Formacao Bruta de 
Capital Fixo] that had accumulated during the four previous 
quarters began to climb, thus reverting the negative trend of 
1991 and 1992." 
  The number of new factories (industrial plants) still 
remains 
small, as in the case of Cenibra [Brazil-Japanese Cellulose 
Corporation] [sentence as published]. Companies are, however, 
investing in productivity, quality improvement, and the 
environment. Caiuby said that Confab earned 20 percent of its 
sales in a bad year from the sale of $14 million worth of 
dust-removing systems for Usiba [Bahia Iron and Steel Mill] and 
Acesita [Itabiera Special Steel Company]." 
  The largest steel distributor in the country, Rio Negro 
company increased its sales of sheet steel by 34 percent during 
the first quarter compared to the same period in 1993. During 
the first quarter of 1994 Usiminas, Cosipa, and CSN [National 
Iron and Steel Company] produced 1.616 million tonnes of sheet 
steel, some 21.7 percent more than the 1.330 million tonnes 
produced during the same period last year. The 286,000-tonne 
increase relates to the direct consumption of the car industry 
for four months," said Loureiro [not further identified]. 
"Consumption has dropped since April but will increase with the 
implementation of the real," he foresees. 
  Faced with a favorable international market, coffee 
producers 
are experiencing an exceptional moment. Luiz Suplicy Haffers, 
the vice president of the Parana Coffee Association, has said 
that coffee is quoted at $130 per bag. Brazil produces 22 
million bags, which totals $2.4 billion. This is more than was 
obtained in 1993 when the Brazilian production of 25 million 
bags realized $1.65 billion at an average price of $66 per bag. 
Exports this year may range between $1.8 billion and $2 billion 
compared with $1.064 billion in 1993. Considering the record 
harvest figure of 76 million tonnes of grains expected for this 
year, the farming GDP is estimated to rise to 6.6 percent this 
year. This has prompted an increase in tractors and machinery 
sales. 
  Carlos Eduardo Moreira Ferreira, president of the Sao Paulo 
State Federation of Industries (FIESP) has said increased 
investments are essential for long-term economic growth. He 
said: "There are a lot of people waiting to invest and the scene 
will be better defined after the elections," adding, "in the 
electricity field, foreign businessmen seek us out, offering to 
invest -- which has not happened for years." They want to 
invest in mills like Serra da Mesa and in the privatizations of 
Light [Power Services, Inc.] and Escelsa [Espirito Santo Power 
Plants, Inc.]. 
  Moreira Ferreira said: Industrial production dropped in 
April 
"but recovery is possible," adding, "the outlook is neither over 
optimistic or pessimistic." He considers the increase of the 
real salary value by 5.4 percent in April as healthy. The 
economic recovery during the second half of the year depends on 
the success of the Real Plan. "July will be the decisive 
month," he said. Moreira Ferreira is optimistic over the 
economic plan and praised the finance minister's "firm attitude" 
in rejecting salary increases for public and state company 
workers and his presidential support for the Federal Revenue 
Office, which created a favorable atmosphere for economic 
expectations. The FIESP president still has some reservations 
over the policy of "very high" bank interest rates and over 
state banks. He said: "They may increase the public deficit." 
The reduction of import tariffs has created difficulties for 
Brazilian industries.

<F P=106> [Article by Maria Clara R.M. do Prado] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia -- The Brazilian Government is negotiating 
debt payment terms with three debtor countries -- Bolivia, 
Guyana, and Mozambique -- to enable them to make their payments 
through "swap" [preceding word given in English] operations 
using U.S. Treasury long-term "zero coupon bonds" purchased on 
the international secondary market. 
  Based on existing agreements, those countries are paying 
their debts using Brazilian foreign debt titles purchased on the 
secondary market. They thus obtain a large discount by passing 
old debt papers to the Central Bank with a previously negotiated 
discount, which is normally below market prices. 
  But the foreign debt agreement reached between Brazil and 
the 
international creditor banks states that restructured debt bonds 
cannot be negotiated on the secondary market for at least two 
years, this being the "phase-in" [preceding word given in 
English] period for making an additional guarantee 
contributions. Renato Naegle, Seplan [Secretariat of Planning 
and Coordination of the Presidency of the Republic] financial 
affairs general coordinator, has said Brazil will have to 
renegotiate "swap" agreements with the three debtor countries. 
  Negotiations with Bolivia, which owes Brazil $70 million, 
have developed to the point that it will be able to use the U.S. 
"zero coupon bonds" to repay its debt. 
  Mozambique's debt is larger. The original agreement was 
reached in June 1992, involving the repayment of nearly $325 
million over 12 years. Another $300 million debt depends on 
defining a new "swap." The case with Guyana is more simple 
because its last repayment installment falls due in September. 
  Before the new foreign debt agreement, Brazil reduced its 
debt by $1.3 billion through "swap" operations. The first 
country to use this kind of operation was Paraguay which paid 
off its debt. 
  The International Affairs Secretariat [Secretaria de 
Assuntos 
Internacionais, Seain] has stated that on 31 March, Brazil had 
credits with the governments of 39 Third World countries. They 
amounted to $5.588 billion, plus $864.3 million with private 
debtors from several countries. To these figures we must add 
$1.490 billion in Bank of Brazil credits that are being 
renegotiated with debtors through the Foreign Credits Evaluation 
Committee [Comite de Avaliacao de Creditos ao Exterior] 
(Comace). Most of these credits involve foreign trade 
operations contracted through the former Finex [Financing and 
Export Fund] or the present Proex [Export Financing Program]. 
  The situation of the six main debtor governments is as 
follows: 
  Poland -- Payments are being made on schedule. Its debt was 
rescheduled within the Paris Club framework. As of last March 
it owes $3.7 billion, of which nearly $1.2 billion is contracted 
with the Bank of Brazil. 
  Angola -- The second largest debtor; owes Brazil nearly $800 
million. It did not comply with the additional agreement it 
reached with Brazil in 1991 because of the internal political 
problems and the 1992-1993 civil war. A Brazilian mission is 
currently visiting Luanda, holding talks to reach a new 
agreement. 
  Peru -- This country reached a bilateral agreement with 
Brazil in 1987 and it is paying on schedule. Peru owes Brazil 
nearly $390 million. 
  Mozambique -- This is the fourth largest debtor and its $300 
million debt will be renegotiated between the two governments 
during the first half of June, to include "swap" operations. 
  Ecuador -- This country owes Brazil nearly $280 million and 
is paying on schedule. 
  Argentina -- The Argentine Government debt with Brazil 
totals 
about $220 million and payments are being made on schedule 
without any problem. 
  Nigeria -- This country owes nearly $40 million to Brazil. 
Its debt was rescheduled within the Paris Club framework, but 
the Nigerian Government has not been able to pay because it does 
not allow payments by private creditors in Nigerian currency. 
  Cuba -- The Cuban Government's debt with Brazil is small: $5 
million. This debt is being negotiated within the terms of a 
trade deal that foresees the purchase by the Brazilian 
Government of Cuban medicines for an initial amount of $30 
million. The agreement foresees that the Cuban debt will be 
deducted from the Brazilian payment for Cuban products. 
  Seain Secretary Mauro Marcondes Rodrigues recalls that in 
January 1991 the overdue debt by Third World countries with 
Brazil amounted to 75 percent of the total debt; this has 
dropped to 12.9 percent. The overdue debt from the private 
sector of those countries is still high: 73 percent. Marcondes 
Rodrigues has said Comace must now concentrate on recovering the 
credits Brazil granted to the private sector of those countries.

  [Text] Brasilia, 1 Jun (EFE) -- Sources at the Cuban 
Embassy in Brasilia have said that Cuba will amortize $38.3 
million of the debt it owes Brazil with medicines for the 
Brazilian public health sector, based on an agreement negotiated 
by the governments of the two countries. 
  The Brazilian and Cuban Governments recently negotiated a 
new 
medicine deal worth $15 million, of which 50 percent will be 
used for amortizing debts. Another $15 million transaction will 
be concluded in the immediate future.

  [Text] The land occupation operations conducted by the 
Landless People's Movement [MST] are headed by professional 
militants trained by the organization. 
  Ailton Kroda, who coordinated the land occupation operation 
at Lagoa Vermelha (RS) [Rio Grande do Sul State], is a veteran 
in this sort of activity. 
  Kroda already has participated in six land occupation 
operations. He admitted to this newspaper that he already has 
received a lot of land but continues "to help the movement." 
  The MST leaders receive political training. The MST has 
linked up with CUT [Sole Workers Center] and Catholic Church 
groups to create a training center at Braga (RS). 
  Officially, this center is an agricultural technical school 
-- the Foundation for Educational Development and Research 
[Fundacao para o Desenvolvimento Educacional e Pesquisa -- 
Fundep]. 
  The 80 students enrolled at Fundep per year are recommended 
by the MST and CUT. Their ages range from 14 to 18. 
  In the morning they have normal classes. In the afternoon 
they till the land. At night they receive political training. 
  The MST "indoctrination copy books" are supposedly didactic 
material, but they contain biographies of revolutionary figures 
such as Che Guevara and a "calendar of people's struggles." 
  Jose Adelmar Batista, one of three Fundep coordinators, says 
the political training's objective "is to teach the students to 
question unfairness and get organized to fight it."

  [Text] Belo Horizonte -- The Mendes Junior Construction 
Company has won an international bid to build the TSQ-1 
hydroelectric plant on the Nanpan River in China. At an 
estimated cost of $300 million, the power plant will produce 1.2 
million Kw. It must be completed within 64 months. The Mendes 
Junior Construction Company won the bid through a joint venture 
[preceding two words in English] system with the Chinese company 
Jiangnan Water Resources &amp; Hydropower Construction Corp. 
  This is the first project contracted with a Brazilian 
company 
in China. In total, the Mendes Junior Company has 130 projects 
contracted in our country, at an estimated cost of $1.8 billion, 
and nine projects contracted abroad, not counting the bid won in 
China. 
  U.S. and Japanese companies participated in the bid. The 
Chinese Energy Ministry is responsible for contracting the 
successful consortium named South China Hydropower Construction 
Association. Most of the funds will be supplied by the Chinese 
Government. The OECF (a Japanese fund) also will be involved. 
  It is believed that the hydroelectric plant, scheduled for 
construction on the Nanpan River on the Guizhou Province-Guangxi 
Province border in southwest China, is essential to increase 
China's power output. China now has a power output deficit of 
about 50 percent. 
  The TSQ-1's power will mainly be distributed to the new 
industrial belt of Guangzhou (Canton). According to Nilton 
Marchetti, the Mendes Junior Asia Division manager, the company 
will send at least 30 technicians to manage the project.

  [Text] Brasilia, 31 May (AE) -- Workers Party [PT] 
presidential candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva today defended 
the idea that the government must control prices and 
speculators. He said he is against price freezes, but in favor 
of price controls like those adopted in First World countries 
such as Italy and the United States. "There will be no price 
freeze, but the government will do its best to prevent abuse," 
he said. He added that the National Supply Superintendency or 
any similar organization will be very active if he wins the 
elections. 
  Lula said that one of the first steps his administration 
would take would be to summon businessmen who failed to pay for 
their taxes and reach an agreement for the payment of their 
debts. Lula has been told that 50 percent of businessmen have 
not paid their income tax, their tax on manufactured products, 
or their debts with the National Social Security Institute. He 
added that after the debt is rolled on, however, no one will be 
pardoned. "Currently we have no means of collecting these 
debts, because if the government now demands that the companies 
pay their debts the businessmen will have to sell their 
companies." 
  Lula added that, as the government also has huge debts, he 
will propose to the creditor banks the rescheduling of the 
domestic debt to enable the government to invest about $100 
billion per year. According to his evaluations, this amount -- 
plus foreign investment -- will allow the country to grow from 5 
percent to 7 percent per year. During an electoral rally in the 
Federal District, Lula said: "Our economists say that the 
domestic debt is much more serious than the foreign debt." 
Nonetheless, Brazil's situation is better than that of Italy 
and Japan. According to Lula, the Brazilian debt represents 34 
percent of the GDP, while in Italy it represents 105 percent and 
in Japan 50 percent. 
  Lula praised Federal Revenue Secretary Osiris Lopes Filho. 
He said: "I believe he is a serious person who has good 
intentions and is trying to put an end to tax evasion." Lula 
believes, however, that good intentions are all he has, because 
he does not have the tools to control abuse. "He cannot arrest 
anyone for tax evasion," he said. He added that he will propose 
a reduction of taxes, and that the PT is against the provisional 
tax on financial operations. 
  If elected, Lula will only send draft bills to Congress 
after 
being sure they will be approved. "First, we will negotiate to 
the point of exhaustion," he said. When the government is sure 
that it has the majority of votes, it will send the draft bill 
to Congress, Lula said. He became PT leader in the Chamber of 
Deputies after being elected federal deputy for the 1987-1991 
mandate. The PT fiscal reform could result from constitutional 
reform or from proposals to amend the Constitution. To ensure 
the latter, the government will have to count on the support of 
three-fifths of the deputies and senators -- that is, 302 
deputies and 49 senators.

<F P=106> [Article by Monica Gugliano] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia -- The fact that PT [Workers Party] 
presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva may be 
victorious in the elections is robbing many businessmen of their 
sleep. Will Lula maintain market rules? What will he do with 
the foreign debt? What would the size of the state be during a 
possible PT administration? Will he be able to keep control of 
the different factions within his party? These are some of the 
questions that concern domestic and multinational companies, 
which have hired the services of consultants to draw up the 
profile for a possible PT administration. So far, the forecasts 
made by the companies are discouraging. 
  Former Minister Mailson da Nobrega from MCM Consultants 
said: 
"We are working on two possible scenarios -- one in which there 
will be a centrist administration, and another one with a 
leftist administration. The scenario with Lula is the most 
negative one." 
  Consultant firms are for the time being betting that the 
presidential election will be decided between the PSDB 
[Brazilian Social Democratic Party] candidate, Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso, and Lula. 
  Consultant Walder de Goes said: "The succession has already 
polarized between Cardoso and Lula. All public opinion polls 
agree with this." 
  According to the consultants' assessment, Lula's election as 
president could trigger a flight of capital. 
  Da Nobrega foresees that "the banks that grant lines of 
credit ranging from $25 to $30 billion are the very ones on 
which Lula and his team are threatening to declare a moratorium. 
If Lula is elected president, those lines of credit will be 
considerably curtailed." 
  The reasons underpinning the negative forecasts are 
manifold, 
and increase every time Lula changes his remarks and evinces 
ambiguity in his proposals. The PT platform, for example, 
proposes the rescheduling of Brazil's external debt. Yet the 
bankers who have heard Lula and Deputy Aloizio Mercadante 
[PT-SP] [Sao Paulo] in the United States were concerned. 
  Da Nobrega stated that "Lula and Mercadante frightened their 
audience with their ignorance and defiant manner." 
  Goes said: "The scenario portends difficulties, but if at a 
certain moment it becomes clear that Lula will win the 
elections, strategies to adapt to this situation will start to 
crop up. Nobody wants to destroy the country just because the 
PT won the elections." 
  Another great concern is to try to fathom how the different 
PT factions will behave. 
  Da Nobrega noted that "the fragmentation of the PT into so 
many factions gives rise to much confusion. Everybody is 
convinced that the apparent party union is only geared to 
winning the elections." 
  Last week, Lula's remarks to justify the use of a sound 
truck 
from the ABC Metallurgic Trade Union for an election rally 
caused a rise in the temperature of mistrust. 
  Moreover, among all the negative assessments of a possible 
PT 
administration, the forecast that Lula will not have a majority 
in Congress, and that he will find it difficult to make 
alliances with other parties, is the one that carries the most 
weight. 
  Evaristo Dias, from Santafe Ideias, states that "from an 
ideological standpoint, there is no concern about Lula's 
administration. There is, however, real fear, which stems from 
his remarks rather than from what they represent."

<F P=106> [Article by Otto Sarkis and Luiz Antonio Novaes] </F>
  [Text] During the 1989 presidential campaign, five of the 
government's intelligence organs were mobilized to keep tabs on 
Brazil Popular Front candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva. The 
spies focused especially closely on the most radical groups 
within the PT [Workers Party]. Coordinated by the SNI [National 
Intelligence Service] and in cooperation with the secret police 
services of Argentina, Israel, and England, agents were 
infiltrated into organizations that had a history of activity in 
the armed struggle. They kept Planalto Palace supplied with the 
documents prepared during the campaign. The results of the 
investigation are found in 154 pages of reports produced by the 
Alfa 1 Working Group, or GT-A1 as it was known in the business, 
and obtained by ISTOE on an exclusive basis. In eight months, 
the SNI listed 17 radical factions housed within the PT, studied 
the modus operandi of 21 leftist organizations in Latin America, 
and identified, among 300 militants, 97 Brazilians who had 
studied guerrilla warfare in foreign countries. 
  The documents prepared by the group state the target of the 
operation, the working rules to be observed by the information 
analysts, the minutes of the meetings, their final conclusions, 
and--frequently--refer to internal flaws in the official 
intelligence system. Begun in March 1989, the spying in the PT 
was intended to detect the potential for emergence of an armed 
movement that would seize power in Brazil. On 10 November 
[1989], five days prior to the first round of voting, the 
"brain" of the Brazilian espionage effort concluded that 
although the party was respecting the rules of democracy, the 
ideological base of the PT was still "orthodox Marxist," founded 
on the class struggle. 
  The only reason Lula did not win the support of some people 
in the top echelon of the government in the runoff election was 
that the SNI found that he was hostage to radical schools of 
thought. President Jose Sarney and his minister/chief of the 
SNI, Ivan de Souza Mendes, were personally at odds with Fernando 
Collor, who had called the former "corrupt" and Planalto Palace 
a "den of thieves." The task of collecting and analyzing the 
information for the GT-A1 was an important factor in the 
decision by Sarney, General Ivan, and other Planalto aides to 
cast blank ballots. 
  Other participants in the investigation besides the SNI were 
the Intelligence Centers of the Army (CIE), the Navy (CIM), the 
Air Force (Secint), and the Federal Police's DOPS [Department of 
Political and Social Order], which was then headed by Chief 
Amaury Galdino, later the Federal Police director during the 
Collor administration. After obtaining the reports, ISTOE 
contacted five high officials in the intelligence community. On 
Wednesday 27 April, we located the coordinator of the entire 
operation, Colonel Jose Luis Savio Costa (Reserve), who was then 
an advisor to the SNI's Central Agency, headed by General 
Freitas Almeida. Costa confirmed the authenticity of the 
documents and agreed to talk with this magazine provided that 
the names of three other SNI agents who worked on the operation 
were not revealed. Two of them are still in the Intelligence 
Undersecretariat of the SAE [Strategic Affairs Secretariat], an 
office linked to the Presidency of the Republic that absorbed 
what was left of the SNI. On Thursday, 28 April [1994], Galdino 
told ISTOE that he had attended the first meeting of the five 
Alfa groups--one from each organ--at which three agents from 
SIDE [Secretariat for State Intelligence], the Argentina secret 
police, were also present. 
  The Alfa groups were initially set up to monitor the risk 
that disturbances might break out in Brazil similar to the La 
Tablada armed uprising in Argentina on 22 January 1989, or the 
Caracazo, the popular revolt that occurred in 
Venezuela that same year. The SIDE agents alerted the Brazilian 
intelligence community to the possibility that La Tablada had 
been planned in the zone along the border between the two 
countries. Two Brazilian sisters had participated in the 
invasion of the Argentine barracks: Aldira and Celia Pereira 
Nunes. Aldira died. The Argentines suspected that terrorist 
Henrique Haroldo Gorriarah Merlo, aka "El Pelado," was behind 
the attack. He was thought to have masterminded the 
assassination of Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza in 
September 1980, in Asuncion, Paraguay. According to the SNI 
investigation, El Pelado had made several visits to Praia 
Grande, on the Sao Paulo coast, between 1968 and 1975. In 1983, 
he was shadowed in Sao Paulo by Brazilian agents. Besides the 
Argentine terrorist, a Brazilian--Expedito Carvalho, aka "Paolo 
Parra"--had been named as one of the leaders of La Tablada. 
  The reports obtained by ISTOE do not mention those two 
individuals, since Operation Alfa ultimately expanded to become 
a meticulous analysis of the groups on the Left, both legal and 
clandestine, in Brazil. There are, however, references to three 
other investigations undertaken by the SNI that involved 
monitoring two terrorists--the "Gringo," "Goiabada," and 
"Acapulco" operations. The "revolutionary movements" in Latin 
America, mainly those of Colombia, Peru, Argentina, Uruguay, 
Chile, Venezuela, and El Salvador, were analyzed, as were their 
ties to the Brazilian Left. 
  At that point in time, according to the SNI, the Latin 
leftists were coordinated by cells established in Nicaragua, 
Cuba, or Libya. "By then, talking about armed struggle was a 
thing of the past," Admiral Mario Cesar Flores, now the 
minister/chief of the Strategic Affairs Secretariat said on 
Wednesday the 27th. "That's over with. People are no longer 
being followed around in Brazil for ideological reasons," Flores 
said. After setting out the rules governing the work routine of 
the GT's [Working Groups] in a document dated 30 March [year not 
given] entitled "Analysis of the National Trend (Political 
Violence)," in which the obtaining of the Argentine information 
is reported and the British and Israelis are asked to mobilize, 
the SNI produced, on 18 April [year not given], its first 
document on the Brazilian "revolutionary Lefts." They are 
described as more "prudent" organizations--but still fully 
captive to the "possibility of the eclosion of the armed 
struggle." 
  All the documents are written in typical leftist language 
and 
that report, for example, studies the existence of the 
"objective and subjective conditions for revolution." Col. Savio 
Costa was considered at Planalto Palace as one of the SNI's most 
well-versed specialists in Marxist theory. Among his 
recommendations are requests for surveillance of the student 
movement, the Progressive Church, the actions of labor unions, 
and the news reporters in the press. In analyzing the 
possibility that a "charismatic leader" might foster conditions 
favorable to a "union of the Lefts" and the "armed movement," 
the SNI is referring indirectly to Lula. It asks that leaders 
who have that potential be monitored not only in the "political 
arena" but also in their personal lives. Another factor uniting 
the Lefts was the activity of the radical Right. The UDR [Rural 
Democratic Union] was also closely watched by the SNI. 
  The Alfa GT listed the following leftist organizations as 
priority targets of surveillance: the PCBR [Brazilian 
Revolutionary Communist Party], the PRC [Communist Revolutionary 
Party], the ALP [expansion not given], the PLP [Progressive 
Liberal Party], the MCR [Revolutionary Communist Movement], the 
PRO [expansion not given]--all given top priority. Assigned 
secondary priority were the Trotskyite organizations CS, ORMD-S, 
OQI, COT-QI, COT-PT [expansions not given], PORT-P 
[Revolutionary Workers Party-Trotskyite Faction] and PRT do B 
[expansion not given]. The PCdoB [Communist Party of Brazil] and 
the MR-8 [8 October Revolutionary Movement] (neither allied with 
nor housed in the PT) ranked third in priority. The PCB 
[Brazilian Communist Party] came last. The 21 leftist 
organizations in South America, most of them Argentine, were 
always selected with an eye to their connections with alleged 
Cuban or Nicaraguan commandos and their possible links to 
Brazilians. Cuban, Nicaraguan, and Libyan diplomats were also 
kept under surveillance. 
  The efficiency of the SNI, capable of listing 97 Brazilians 
who had taken courses in guerrilla warfare in foreign countries, 
was only relative. The agency was only able to locate 71 of this 
contingent in Brazil--26 were still unaccounted for. On 25 
September [year not given, photo accompanying article suggests 
it was 1989], a periodic report expressed regret, for example, 
that the lack of systematic studies and the absence of a 
documentation at the Central Agency made it impossible to locate 
Jose Luiz Del Royo, described as an ex-militant in the ALN 
[National Liberating Alliance]. The militant not found by the 
government spies was located by ISTOE on Thursday the 28th 
[1994]. Now shuttling between Milan and Sao Paulo, Del Royo is a 
writer and historian. He returned to Brazil in 1979 under the 
amnesty, and since then has been publicly active, representing 
Italian social studies institutes. 
  He voted in all the elections and holds a passport. In 1986, 
he wrote the book Historias do Primeiro de Maio 
[Stories from May 1], which received plenty of attention in the 
press. "Now we discover that the intelligence service was 
working in our favor," Del Royo said, sarcastically. According 
to him, the DOPS has accurate information on his activities in 
Brazil. "That means they didn't even cross-check the data," he 
concluded. In 1982, Del Royo launched a magazine, Memoria 
da Historia [Memoirs of History], in Brazil. His name 
appeared on the masthead of four published issues. The SNI 
catalogued that magazine. 
  According to the regulations governing the work of each 
analyst, the coordinator of the Alfa GT ordered them to meet 
daily. On Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday afternoons the GT-A1 
met to read through documents and reassess previous studies to 
update the information. Thursdays were reserved for evaluations 
of political developments. Periodically, the Alfa GT's met to 
exchange experiences. The first meeting of this kind was held on 
10 and 11 May [year not given, presumed to be 1989], and the 
work continued until Collor's inauguration in March 1990. 
  In another document, of 15 pages, the SNI made a study of 
the 
educational and training background of former militants of the 
Left and their influence on the new members. The organ assessed 
the various factors that led these militants to get involved in 
the armed movements starting in 1964. In 1989, the SNI perceived 
that those militants were more influential and more careful: 
"So, they had progressed from the impetuousness of adolescence 
to maturity and, although not as vigorous physically, had gained 
greater cultural and political leverage."

  The coordinator-general of the spying operation against the 
PT and its radical factions, Col. Jose Luis Savio Costa, 61, who 
recently underwent a triple bypass, subscribes to official party 
publications and buys books on Marxism. Currently he is reading 
Jurgen Habermas's Necessidade de Revisao da Esquerda 
and Anatomia da Esquerda Universal, by Ferenc Feher 
and Agnes Heller [original titles not given]. In the reserve 
since 1990, married, four children and five grandchildren, he is 
setting up a property security company in Brasilia. Following 
are highlights from the interview he gave ISTOE at his home. 
  [ISTOE] Do you know whether the intelligence organs still 
have undercover agents in the PT? 
  [Savio] There will always be infiltrators whenever you have 
a 
radical group, provided the service is an intelligence service. 
People were not planted in the PT, but in the illegal 
organizations that existed within the PT. We had people in the 
PCBR, the old ALN, in the MRC, the PRC--organizations that had 
blended into the factions in the PT. 
  [ISTOE] And what is the situation now? 
  [Savio] I am out of that so I don't know, but if some agency 
thinks a party is capable of putting the democratic state at 
risk, it will inevitably try to infiltrate that party. I think 
that right now, the Causa Operaria [Workers' Cause] 
is an illegal party. It was expelled from the PT and is acting 
without recognition. There may be some "moles" in Causa, but it 
is a very closed group, one with tight security because it is 
small. 
  [ISTOE] Did the SNI infiltrate people into the Sixth 
National 
Meeting of the PT, in 1988, the last one of your era? How did it 
do so? 
  [Savio] Yes, by issuing them credentials as if they were 
state representatives. 
  [ISTOE] And now, do you think there were "plants" at the 
Ninth meeting? 
  [Savio] There is no need now, everything is open. 
  [ISTOE] Were the PCB and PCdoB also infiltrated in 1989? 
  [Savio] Traditionally the PCdoB was infiltrated. 
  [ISTOE] And now? 
  [Savio] Now there are friendships between former members of 
the enforcement agencies and the subversives. They talk about 
ideology. 
  [ISTOE] Is there any way for the intelligence organs to go 
back to the former "moles" and get them to spy on the Left? 
  [Savio] They know there are plenty of shameless moles out 
there. That has always been true. 
  [ISTOE] Does the SAE have that list of moles? 
  [Savio] I don't know, the SAE did not inherit all the SNI's 
material. A lot of things were neutralized during the 
transition. A lot of people, disgusted with the way things were 
done, ruined the documents so they could not be used. 
  [ISTOE] In your opinion, is the PT still a revolutionary 
party? 
  [Savio] It is not I, but the PT's own documents, that say 
so. 
The party is based on the class struggle and it wants to achieve 
as nonviolent an institutional breakdown as possible. 
  [ISTOE] Does the PT pose a threat to democracy? 
  [Savio] I am not afraid of the PT, but of its radical 
factions. My greatest fear is that the election campaign will 
become hardened, so that the radical groups that thought they 
saw victory at hand might then lose hope and start doing things 
that threaten the institutional order. 
  [ISTOE] If you were in the SNI, would you suggest that a 
group shadow the PT? 
  [Savio] There should be a group that would monitor the 
election situation for signs of potential political violence and 
take action to prevent evolution of the problem. 
  [ISTOE] Do you think such a group is being readied? 
  [Savio] I don't know. The suspicion that hangs over the 
intelligence organs is preventing them from acting. That was set 
up, a campaign that turned out right [sentence as published]. 
Despite that, Jose Dirceu (a federal deputy and PT 
candidate for governor of Sao Paulo) is interested, 
excessively interested, in intelligence and is capable of 
organizing a system for the PT. 
  [ISTOE] Do you think the PT has a functioning SNI of its 
own? 
  [Savio] I think there are a lot of PT spooks 
[petepongas] out there.

<H5>  Spooks in the Backlands--The Service That Did Not Predict </H5>
Its End Now Works on Droughts 
  Except for the building and the idiosyncrasies typical of 
any 
intelligence service, such as a mania for security, little or 
nothing remains of the old SNI. In its heyday, the "Service," as 
it was called by insiders, had as many as 3,000 employees in 
Brazil and other countries. Unable to anticipate the full impact 
of Fernando Collor's resentment of its activities, the SNI was 
taken by surprise when the "hunter of maharajahs" abolished it 
in March 1990 and created the Strategic Affairs Secretariat 
(SAE). Collor blamed the spooks of the secret service for the 
abduction, accompanied by a mock execution by firing squad, of 
which he had supposedly been the victim during his student days 
at the University of Brasilia. The implosion of the SNI reduced 
its personnel to a little more than 1,400 employees. The 
overseas agents were deactivated, and illegal and covert 
operations such as telephone-tapping ended officially. 
  That does not mean the Intelligence Undersecretariat of the 
SAE, which inherited the estate of the SNI, might not sometimes 
resort to "bugging" someone's telephone. To do so, however, it 
needs court permission. The SAE does not even know what happened 
to the SNI files, many of them destroyed by agents who were 
unhappy with the change. This is admitted by Col. Savio Costa 
himself, one of those affected by Collor's purge. By its very 
nature, the "Service" continues to eavesdrop on events it thinks 
the President of the Republic should know about: strikes, rural 
unrest, and "more prosaic things," as SAE chief Admiral Mario 
Cesar Flores said. An example of the latter would probably be 
the survey made last year of the drought in the Northeast, to 
guide the government in selecting the cities to be given 
priority in federal aid. 
  Furthermore, the Intelligence Undersecretariat is no longer 
headed by senior military officers, as it was even during the 
Collor administration. Part of the folklore is the anecdote 
about former SAE Secretary Pedro Paulo Leoni Ramos's attempt to 
visit the facilities of the undersecretariat. He was barred from 
entering by the spooks on duty at the building in Brasilia's 
South Police Sector. Now the undersecretariat is headed by 
journalist Afonso Antonio Marcondes, who never practiced the 
profession for which he studied. Instead, he has been a career 
employee since SNI days. Security is still strict. The 
Intelligence Undersecretariat has a sophisticated system that 
includes locks with electronic codes. Outsiders, when they visit 
the building, are escorted at all times by agents. The site of 
the former National Intelligence School now houses the Center 
for Basic and Advanced Human Resources Training (Cefahr), used 
by the undersecretariat for courses in international espionage 
and counter-espionage aimed mainly at protecting scientific and 
technological projects. At the end of the year, the government 
plans to sponsor the first open competition in the "sector" to 
recruit 60 new analysts.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said on 27 May that 
Brazil's participation in the UN Security Council is "legitimate 
and effective." 
  Amorim noted: "It is of growing importance for all 
countries, 
not only the rich countries or those with nuclear weapons, to 
participate in this council." 
  The minister participated on 27 May in the First National 
Meeting of Strategic Studies at the Strategic Affairs 
Secretariat (SAE)'s Strategic Studies Center. 
  The SAE-sponsored meeting's goal is to promote an exchange 
among the country's think tanks involved in "strategy" affairs 
and demonstrate the government's interest in the scattered 
studies conducted in Brazil in this area today. 
  Representatives from public and private organizations and 
universities participated in the meeting.

<F P=106> [Interview with deputies-elect Frank Vargas and Fabian </F>
Alarcon by Miguel Rivadeneira; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Substantive reforms will soon be formally proposed 
that will enable Congress to function more effectively after it 
opens on 10 August 1994. 
  To accomplish this, once the election results have been 
proclaimed the deputies-elect will have to meet informally to 
outline their working plans. 
  The subject of perspectives for the new Congress and for the 
country in general was examined by deputies-elect Frank Vargas 
of the Ecuadoran Revolutionary Popular Action and Fabian Alarcon 
of the Alfarist Radical Front while taking part in Radio Quito's 
program "Controversy," directed by Miguel Rivadeneira. Marco 
Flores of the Social Christian Party was also invited but did 
not attend. 
  Alarcon said that the new deputies-elect "cannot make 
mistakes this time and must salvage Congress' image by hard 
work." 
  He recognized that the people are unhappy and frustrated 
about political activities and legislation, and that urgent 
action is needed to remedy the situation. 
  Vargas also recognized a certain culpability on the part of 
politicians, but he said that they are not the only ones to 
blame, but the problem involves everyone, and therefore there is 
a responsibility to redeem Congress' work and actions for the 
benefit of the people. 
  [Rivadeneira] Frank Vargas, is it possible to change 
Congress, which has not responded to the needs of the people, 
and place it at the service of great national interests? 
  [Vargas] I believe that a moral decision is indispensable to 
put aside personal and group interests, and emotional 
considerations, forgetting for the moment the desertion of 
deputies who have become "independents." This is currently the 
case with 21 persons who have seriously damaged the image of the 
parties and Congress in the eyes of public opinion. 
  [Rivadeneira] Would not freedom of thought be restricted by 
party pressures on a deputy to act according to his leaders' 
wishes and not his conscience? 
  [Vargas] I believe it is important that there be maturity 
and 
conscience, or the people will make their demands heard that 
Congress keep their promises. The people can even request that 
someone be replaced if that person does not obey the popular 
mandate. For my part, I will be very reliable. I will never miss 
a meeting. 
  [Rivadeneira] Are these changes feasible and will Congress 
be 
disposed to cooperate in the process? 
  [Vargas] I am certain that the changes are feasible, and 
this 
is why it must not be undertaken lightly. I believe that today, 
more than ever, there should be a different attitude, of 
responsibility, of patriotism, of work, of reliability. In any 
case, legislation as well as oversight are fundamental for the 
country to come out of its crisis. 
  [Rivadeneira] Will General Vargas support the modernization 
that the current government has begun? 
  [Vargas] Nobody can oppose an improvement or a restructuring 
of the state because evolution demands it, but as it has been 
presented and is being carried out, there is no modernization as 
such, but rather a consolidation of power that is very far from 
the country's collective and sovereign interests. 
  [Rivadeneira] Fabian Alarcon, how would you go about 
improving Congress' performance in the next two years? 
  [Alarcon] In the past two years Congress has touched bottom. 
The Congress has not made laws, nor has it exercised oversight, 
nor has it met any of its responsibilities. The Ecuadoran people 
sent a very clear message to the country, the politicians, and 
the parties on 1 May: it wants a change in attitudes at all 
levels of the state, and especially with regard to Congress. 
  [Rivadeneira] Is it possible to satisfy this popular demand 
and change attitudes in Congress? 
  [Alarcon] Yes, those attitudes can be changed. I remember 
that when I presided over Congress we worked intensively. About 
180 proposed bills were drafted and 80 were passed into law, 
many of which were very important for the country. The work was 
performed with responsibility and discipline. 
  [Rivadeneira] Fabian Alarcon, to what do you attribute the 
change? 
  [Alarcon] Unfortunately, these past two years changed the 
face of what Congress had been, and this basically is because 
the government greatly interfered during that time, buying 
deputies of the various parties. Therefore, I believe that the 
government is responsible for what has happened in Congress 
during the past two years. 
  [Rivadeneira] What corrective actions must be taken to 
prevent Congress from continuing in this state of deterioration? 
  [Alarcon] The needs of Ecuadorans must be transformed into 
proposed laws. First, Congress must be made to work and to 
exercise self-discipline. Congress oversees everyone, but who 
oversees Congress? 
  [Rivadeneira] Fabian Alarcon, how can Congress be 
supervised? 
  [Alarcon] It has to be by self-supervision through laws. We 
will submit a proposed law that says a deputy who does no work 
is a deputy who gets no pay, that requires punctuality and 
regular attendance at the legislative commissions. If a 
nonperforming deputy maintains this attitude during a succeeding 
month he will be sent home, with the people's approval. 
  [Rivadeneira] What about the independent deputies? 
  [Alarcon] As for the famous "independent" deputies, a law 
should be passed to the effect that deputies who disaffiliate or 
who are expelled from their parties will automatically cease to 
be deputies, out of a sense of political morality. Finally, I 
propose that we deputies-elect start to work along broad 
guidelines, on legislation, as well as on oversight matters, to 
be able to go to work right away on 10 August so that the 
country can see a new image of Congress. 
  [Rivadeneira] Fabian Alarcon, will you support the changes 
the country needs and the process of modernization that the 
government is carrying out? 
  [Alarcon] No one can be opposed to change and modernization, 
which are necessary. However, as it has been presented, one must 
ask where the change is headed. If it is to consolidate the 
privileges of the few, we are absolutely opposed to 
modernization. If it is to benefit the vast majority, we are for 
it. Unfortunately, the government is confusing modernization 
with privatization.

  [Text] President Eduardo Frei today confirmed that within 
four weeks' time he will travel to Washington at the invitation 
of U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
  It had been rumored in Washington that Clinton was 
interested 
in inviting his Chilean counterpart to a meeting at the White 
House. 
  Today in Santiago, President Frei confirmed the invitation 
to 
visit the United States at the end of the month. 
  [Begin Frei recording] Well, we are awaiting the official 
announcement by the White House and by the Chilean Foreign 
Ministry of a visit to Washington on 28 June, a visit that will 
include a working day with President Clinton at the White House. 
[end recording] 
  In Washington, Patricio Silva, Chilean ambassador to the 
United States, reported that the agenda of the meeting will 
include political issues, but that Chile's overriding interest 
will be the possibility of joining NAFTA. 
  [Begin Silva recording] It is a clear indication of the 
Clinton administration's interest in Latin America--which is 
expressed in this invitation made to the president--and 
especially in Chile. As you very well know, Chile's presence in 
U.S. news, public opinion, and political opinion is quite 
considerable. [end recording]

  [Text] Vladimir Shumeyko, president of the Federation 
Council of the Russian Congress, has said Russia needs a stable 
government to grow economically. For this reason the government 
promoted a consensus pact with the political sectors that was 
joined by main enterprises a few weeks ago. 
  Shumeyko, with a delegation of businessmen and deputies, 
began yesterday a three-day visit to Chile. Among other 
activities, he is scheduled to meet today with President Eduardo 
Frei, to whom he will deliver a personal message from Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin. 
  Shumeyko arrived on the morning of 22 May, accompanied by 
his 
wife. He expressed optimism over the future of his country 
despite the economic and social problems it is currently facing. 
  Shumeyko referred to the prospects of the Treaty to Attain 
Social Harmony [Tratado para el Alcance de la Concordia Social], 
signed on 28 April by the Russian president and 200 other 
politicians. 
  He asserted: "The less fighting there is among politicians, 
the better it is for the economy." 
  He added that on Friday [not further specified] the 
directors 
of the most important Russian enterprises signed the treaty. He 
explained the purpose of the pact, saying: "Our greatest concern 
now is to enjoy peace in the political arena, to establish a 
consensus in the political field, and to give the Russian 
Federation a chance to work in stability." 
  The Russian delegation was met by Russian Ambassador to 
Chile 
Vasiliy Gromov and Mariano Fontecilla, the diplomatic 
coordinator of Congress, who represented Senate President 
Gabriel Valdes at the airport. 
  Valdes held a private luncheon for Shumeyko and his wife at 
the Concha y Toro vineyards. 
  Shumeyko said he hoped to make "important achievements" 
during his brief visit to Chile and to learn as much as possible 
about the political process and the country's economic situation. 
  The Russian visitor said Russia and Chile have "a lot in 
common." 
  He explained: "The Russian Federation is still going from a 
totalitarian phase to the construction of a democratic state, an 
open civil society." 
  He added that Russia and Chile share celebration dates 
because "President Eduardo Frei was elected on 11 December while 
the Russian Federation's new Congress, with its two chambers, 
was elected and the new Russian Constitution was implemented on 
12 December." 
  Shumeyko announced that he will meet with Chilean senators 
and deputies with whom he hopes to tighten interparliamentary 
relations. 
  He added that he hopes to increase intragovernment visits 
between the two countries, and to establish direct contact 
between Russian and Chilean businessmen. 
  For this reason, he added, he is accompanied by Russian 
deputies, businessmen, and representatives of Russian 
corporations and banks. 
  Shumeyko will meet tomorrow with Senate President Gabriel 
Valdes and acting Chamber of Deputies President Juan Carlos 
Latorre. In the afternoon he will meet with Finance Minister 
Eduardo Aninat and Planning and Coordination under Secretary 
Pedro Goic. 
  Tomorrow he will meet with Santiago Mayor Jaime Ravinet; 
Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa, and the president of the 
Supreme Court Marcos Aburto. He is scheduled to lunch with 
businessmen at the Union Club. On Friday he will leave for 
Buenos Aires on a special flight. 
  Shumeyko said he is optimistic over the future of his 
country 
although he admitted that Russia is facing difficulties in 
transforming a centralized economy into a free market economy. 
  Shumeyko commented that the military industry faces 
difficulties because orders placed by the government have been 
cut to just 10 percent. He added that there are also serious 
problems in the agricultural sector, especially the kolkhoz and 
sovkhoz, the old socialist peasant organizations. 
  Shumeyko added: "We now place emphasis on the business 
sector, on the private entrepreneur," adding that 40 million of 
the 150 million inhabitants work for enterprises that no longer 
belong to the state. 
  He believes the lack of private sector statistics 
contributes 
to the somber panorama with which the Russian economy is 
described. 
  He said that official data currently shows that 11 percent 
of 
the population lives under the minimum poverty level compared 
with 37 percent last year. 
  "This is why we can state that currently nobody dies of 
hunger in Russia," he said. 
  Shumeyko ruled out the possibility that Congress agree to 
bring forward the presidential elections, scheduled for June 
1995, as Vice President Alexandr Rutskoy requested. 
  "There is no room for this request. I do not think the 
Senate, which sets the date and calls presidential elections, 
will listen to Rutskoy's request to contradict the Constitution." 
  Shumeyko said Congress and government authorities abide by 
the Constitution, which was amended almost six months ago. He 
denied that President Yeltsin grants less importance to the 
legislative branch which, in his opinion, plays a very important 
role in Russian politics. 
  He explained that the Senate, over which he presides, has 
important tasks, among them approving decrees issued by the 
president regarding emergency issues, the use of Russian troops 
in foreign territory, and border problems. 
  The Senate also approves the appointment of the attorney 
general and the members of the Constitutional Court and the 
Supreme Court. It also acts if the president resigns and is in 
charge of calling elections.

<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister German Correa by reporter </F>
Maria Eugenia Oyarzun at La Moneda in Santiago on 18 May] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Oyarzun] How would you assess 
the situation involving [Carabineros Director General] Rodolfo 
Stange, 45 days after it started? 
  [Correa] I still believe it is a complex situation, not only 
because of all the implications regarding Gen. Stange, but also 
because this is a highly sensitive issue in view of the duties 
with which the Carabineros are entrusted in their capacity as 
uniformed police, that is, safeguarding peace and order. This is 
why this is an extremely delicate issue, as anything that 
undermines public order has very serious implications for 
society as a whole, and not only for the government or for the 
Carabineros. The situation, therefore, had to be handled with 
great care. 
  [Oyarzun] Do you believe the situation was handled with 
"great care," or with the gracefulness of a bull in a china shop? 
  [Correa] In practice, in compliance with express government 
orders, the executive branch has handled Gen. Stange's problem 
through the Defense Ministry. The Interior Ministry, which is 
under my responsibility and which according to the Constitution 
is responsible for safeguarding public order and the safety of 
citizens, was not directly involved in the negotiations. As a 
member of the political team, however, we were permanently 
informed about the entire situation, discussing the issue and as 
a group adopting decisions with the president. I have 
nevertheless had a normal working relation with the Carabineros, 
striving so that the problem with its director general would not 
have an impact on public order, which has been maintained at 
normal levels. 
  [Oyarzun] Is it true that last week the Interior Ministry 
and 
the Carabineros held unofficial contacts to solve the crisis? 
  [Correa] Within these past 40 days the government has been 
willing to explore all possibilities. 
  [Oyarzun] The government or the Interior Ministry? 
  [Correa] The government as such; the Interior Ministry is 
part of the government. We studied all the possibilities that 
could have led to a proper solution. Unfortunately, the 
different alternatives have not allowed us to achieve a 
definitive solution, but I hope we will be able to do so in the 
next 30 days. 
  [Oyarzun] What is this definitive solution? 
  [Correa] I sincerely believe that a continued lack of 
definition regarding the Carabineros command is not desirable. 
  [Oyarzun] Who is to blame for this lack of definition, the 
Carabineros or the government? 
  [Correa] I would say that this is a result of the situation 
itself. There was a court ruling on one of the most abominable 
crimes in Chilean history, which had already caused a crisis in 
the Carabineros high command. This resulted in the ousting of 
the then Carabineros commander, General Cesar Mendoza. 
Throughout the nine years of this court case, there have been 
events that have raised some doubts about the role played at the 
time by the Carabineros high command, and Gen. Stange is the 
only member of that high command who is still on active duty. 
The government is not to blame for creating this situation. This 
is the result of a very traumatic event. The government believes 
that the mere fact that charges were raised against the 
Carabineros director general--charges that must be proven in 
court--constitutes in itself a very complicated situation. 
  [Oyarzun] The special judge assigned to investigate the 
alleged crime of "nonfulfillment of military duties," of which 
Gen. Stange is accused, has rejected the request made by the 
lawyers of the accusing party to hold a confrontation [careo] 
between Gen. Stange and other officers and to indict him. Is 
this not an important sign that Gen. Stange is not guilty? 
  [Correa] It is up to the courts to decide that. The 
government has always maintained that the unsuitability of Gen. 
Stange's remaining in his post is not directly associated with 
the result of the court case. In this country there are laws 
through which it is sufficient that an individual be indicted on 
charges of a crime deserving punishment, after which it is 
presumed that he immediately loses certain rights, such as the 
right to vote and to be elected. 
  [Oyarzun] There are those in the government who said that 
Stange's ousting was not a legal issue but a matter of 
principle, and that even if the president lost in this regard, 
the government would win a moral victory. Do you agree with this? 
  [Correa] All this is part of a past we have not yet been 
able 
to overcome. There are many Chileans who suffered in their own 
flesh and blood the rigors of the military regime, through human 
rights violations. There are many pending trials, and many 
things that will have an impact in our lives for years to come. 
I believe that Chile has a very important moral debt with these 
hundreds of thousands of Chileans, many of whose lives were 
destroyed or who endured tortures or were imprisoned. We have to 
make an effort to overcome this past. I believe it is very 
important to pay your dues. I am not speaking negatively, but in 
order to be at peace with ourselves. 
  [Oyarzun] Wouldn't it be better if we overcame some 
chapters in this regard? Do you believe the country can always 
look backward? 
  [Correa] To continue looking to the past is directly related 
to how well or how badly we are able to overcome these 
situations. There are different ways of going about it. One 
would be to throw a blanket over the past, as if nothing had 
happened, like a collective complicity in claiming there were no 
human rights violations in Chile. Such an attitude would solve 
current problems, but not future ones, as the ethical bases of 
democracy and peaceful coexistence would be seriously weakened. 
  I believe that impunity and the fact that people do not 
answer for their deeds undermines the ethical and political 
principles of a democracy. People must have the courage to face 
these issues with high-mindedness. [passage omitted] 
  [Oyarzun] Isn't the agreement reached by the defense 
minister 
and Gen. Stange like a predated check, a kind of "passing the 
ball" for four weeks? 
  [Correa] Undoubtedly we achieved a partial agreement, which 
should give us time to arrive at a definitive solution. 
  [Oyarzun] What does this "definitive" solution for the 
Stange 
issue consist of? Does he have to go? 
  [Correa] This will be decided in the next couple of days. I 
believe we should continue to hold meetings that will allow us 
to find formulas for finding a proper solution to problems. One 
can understand Gen. Stange's interest in seeing that the court 
case against him is definitively resolved, but as I have already 
explained, the general must also understand that it is very 
difficult to exercise a command when one lacks the president's 
trust and backing. [passage omitted] 
  [Oyarzun] What has the administration done in its first 70 
days in government? 
  [Correa] There were several important initiatives. Today we 
are submitting to Congress a bill on the Copper Corporation 
(Codelco), which is of vital importance to the country. This is 
an indication that there have been substantial initiatives in 
the drafting of laws. The opposition criticism that "there is a 
legislative drought" and that there has not been a legislative 
initiative is, therefore, unjust. [passage omitted] 
  [Oyarzun] If you had to render an account of your first 70 
days in government, what would you point out? 
  [Correa] I believe I have fulfilled the tasks that are 
pertinent to my post under not so normal situations. 
  [Oyarzun] Why? 
  [Correa] Because what we have experienced regarding Gen. 
Stange's situation has not been a minor issue. Let me remind 
you that three days after assuming power we were faced with 
General Nunez's retirement, and Gen. Stange's problem cropped up 
11 days after the inauguration and still must be resolved. 
These 70 days, therefore, were not normal. I hope the 
following days will not be as complex. 
  [Oyarzun] Didn't the administration bring these problems 
upon 
itself? 
  [Correa] No. All of those who have been most involved with 
the issue have agreed that there were no solutions other than 
those adopted by the government. 
  [Oyarzun] What about the opposition? 
  [Correa] The opposition has done its job in trying to create 
the greatest number of problems possible; the opposition has 
hardened. Please take into account that this administration has 
not enjoyed the 24 hours of the so-called grace period. I 
believe that even before assuming power we were under quite a 
lot of pressure. In view of this, and because we were facing a 
complex situation, the president invited the member parties of 
the Coalition of Parties for Democracy to discuss the situation. 
We were faced with the difficult issue of Carabineros. This is 
all part of the costs and benefits brought on by continuity. We 
inherited some problems from the previous administration, but 
there are other long-standing problems as well. 
  [Oyarzun] Is it true that you have had disagreements with 
the 
defense minister and the minister of the presidency? 
  [Correa] There have been no disagreements with the defense 
minister. We have a very direct relation, which contributes to 
the openness of our work. As in all human affairs, we share 
different points of view, but through dialogue and discussion we 
will achieve agreement. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Meche Garrido] </F>
  [Text] The government is quite troubled by the fact that 
two of the main political parties in the Coalition (the 
Christian Democrats, DC, and the PPD [Party for Democracy]) are 
immersed in internal elections. 
  There is uneasiness because these elections are preventing 
the Coalition from giving more effective support to President 
Eduardo Frei and his government. The situation was different 
under former President Patricio Aylwin, who received ongoing 
support from the alliance, especially from his own party, the DC. 
  More specifically, however, the internal struggle for the 
presidency of Christian Democracy, a struggle that has 
sharpened, has been compounded in recent days by the battle in 
the PPD, which is beset by a serious problem of internal 
leadership. 
  Much sharp criticism is being leveled at the leadership, 
including the long-time leaders of the party. The most 
widespread complaint in the PPD is that the congressional 
election and the appointment of the cabinet has been followed by 
paralysis in the party, which has done nothing about it. 
  The charges are being leveled directly at its current 
president, Sergio Bitar. Although he is acknowledged as the 
party's undisputed leader, the objection is that after he was 
elected senator from the First Region, he has been unable to 
devote the time to the party leadership that it requires. 
  Concern in the PPD is even greater because despite the 
results of the congressional elections (in which it doubled its 
representation to 15 deputies and two senators), the party's 
profile is becoming blurred today. 
  The situation facing this group is marked not only by the 
departure of Bitar but also by the unmistakable absence of 
Victor Manuel Rebolledo and Jorge Schaulsohn. Now that the 
former has joined the cabinet and the latter has taken over as 
president of the Chamber, the PPD has been left even more 
leaderless. 
  Although the efforts that Vice Presidents Jorge Molina and 
Erich Schnake are making are appreciated, a large majority 
agrees that the leadership crisis that has developed makes the 
election of new officers urgent. But the elections are, in 
principle, scheduled for September, a fact that upsets those who 
want to hasten internal decision-making so that the vigorous PPD 
does not yield the entire progressive sector of the Coalition to 
the Socialist Party, which they acknowledge has done a good job 
of keeping a high profile. 
  For the time being, only Deputy Victor Barrueto and 
electoral 
expert Jose Auth have entered the race for party posts, running 
for president and secretary general, respectively. 
  No others have yet joined the race, as they are waiting for 
the current president, Sergio Bitar, to decide whether or not to 
run again. While they are waiting patiently for this PPD leader 
to make up his mind, the rumor is that he will not run for 
reelection because his goal is to make his name as a national 
senator by devoting all of his time and effort to voters in the 
strategic First Region, which he has done ever since he was 
elected. 
  Should Bitar run again, though, he would face competition 
for 
the first time. This development would in itself be a change, 
inasmuch as one of the main criticisms of this party is that its 
leaders have always been chosen by the top echelon without an 
election in which the rank and file could select the people they 
wanted to lead them. 
  In the event that Bitar runs for reelection, he would 
probably face off against Deputy Victor Barrueto, who has the 
support of former Vice President Victor Manuel Rebolledo; as 
long as he remains a minister, however, he says that he will 
stay out of his party's internal elections. 
  While Bitar thinks things over, PPD spokesmen are not ruling 
out the possibility that the party's former secretary general, 
Deputy Jorge Schaulsohn, might decide to seek its presidency. In 
fact, he himself has said that he has not yet made up his mind 
in this regard. Many have their doubts, however, because this 
legislator is determined to be the finest president of the 
Chamber of Deputies in recent times. 
  The leadership crisis in the PPD has created strife among 
its 
various factions, and because of the existing problems no one 
yet knows which candidates will ultimately face off against each 
other to head up the party. 
  The new officers that party members elect, whoever they may 
be, will have to solve some serious problems facing the PPD, 
because paradoxically its growth has severely weakened its 
internal organization at the national level. 
  One of the most visible difficulties stemming from its lack 
of organization is that very few of its offices are operating in 
communities and regions, just eight of the existing 12. The PPD 
has major operational problems in Valparaiso, and it is thought 
to have idle assets in the second, third, sixth, and other 
regions. 
  Therefore, the challenge facing the new officers is to 
institutionalize the party and renew and expand its roster of 
leaders. 
  A broad cross-section of the party agrees that collective 
leaderships need to be established since until now it has been a 
party of well known figures, which was initially a source of 
strength and representation. It wants to take advantage of this 
asset during the current process of change and renewal. 
  Although the work done during the initial stage by 
well-known 
figures such as Sergio Bitar, Jorge Schaulsohn, Victor Manuel 
Rebolledo, Erich Schnake, and Ricardo Lagos is acknowledged, the 
regions and the metropolitan area are pressing for a renewal so 
that there is competition in the internal elections to end the 
"reign of celebrities." 
  As with its ally the DC, the pace of meetings and talks 
within the party is picking up. On Saturday 23 April, the 
economy minister, Alvaro Garcia, called a meeting to test the 
internal electoral environment. It was attended by, among 
others, Eugenio Tironi, Guillermo del Valle, Maria Antonieta 
Saa, and Erich Schnake. Reportedly, some did not know what it 
was about, while others thought that Sergio Bitar was going to 
announce his candidacy. Instead, Bitar showed up to clarify that 
as president of the PPD he could not belong to an internal 
faction. 
  It was noteworthy and annoying to some in the party that 
several people attending the meeting described themselves as 
leftists, not progressives as the party calls them. A senior 
spokesman for the PPD remarked that it was a serious mistake for 
the group to describe itself as leftist; it did so because of a 
desire to distance itself from other, more moderate factions, 
such as Jorge Schaulsohn's. 
  Spokesmen for another faction were also surprised by the 
greeting that Public Works Minister Ricardo Lagos sent to the 
meeting; some leaders, however, commented that it was 
significant that the leader of the Socialist Party and the PPD 
did not attend the meeting and merely sent his greetings. In any 
event, the involvement of the two Frei cabinet ministers in 
party politics elicited serious objections from leaders and 
members. 
  "Lagos ought to remain above factional strife because he is 
a 
national figure in the coalition left," said a high-level party 
leader. After Lagos sent his letter of greetings to the faction, 
the feeling in the PPD was that he has to clarify his party 
membership inasmuch as his dual status (Socialist and PPD 
member) is untenable. 
  The uneasiness over Lagos's and Garcia's involvement 
presumably prompted a group of deputies to look into the 
possibility of sending a letter to the government saying that it 
is improper for cabinet ministers to create factions in 
coalition parties and be actively involved in the internal 
struggle instead of devoting all of their time to their 
ministries. 
  The internal contest for the presidency seems more personal 
than anything else. It does involve some substantive issues, 
however, as there have been mutual accusations about neoliberal 
influence in the party. 
  Such influence has been roundly denied, although the culture 
of classical liberalism is acknowledged to be broadly 
represented. The progressive philosophy is predominant in the 
PPD, however, as it seeks to distance itself from the Socialist 
Party, especially after the selection of mayors, governors, and 
Regional Ministry Secretariats, in which the Socialists were 
winners. 
  Although the election of its officers is still months away, 
the debate and struggle has already begun in the party, and the 
pace will pick up once the current president, Senator Sergio 
Bitar, makes up his mind about what to do.

  [Text] Caracas, 1 Jun (EFE) -- Venezuelan President Rafael 
Caldera announced today that the economic guarantees established 
in the Venezuelan constitution have been reinstated. 
  Caldera, who took over on 2 February, had suspended economic 
guarantees in order to implement several measures to reorganize 
the Venezuelan economy. The reestablishment of economic 
guarantees is one of the petitions that had been made by 
Venezuelan entrepreneurs to the Christian Democratic president.

<F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno from Miraflores Palace in </F>
Caracas; from the "Union Radio News" newscast] 
  [Text] As is known, the president of the Republic, in full 
use of his legislative powers, on 28 February decided to suspend 
economic guarantees nationwide. Today, however, following an end 
to the problems that prompted the suspension, President Caldera 
decided to reinstate these guarantees at a cabinet meeting. 
  According to Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez, once 
taxes on luxury goods and wholesale transactions were enacted, 
the continued suspension of economic guarantees was no longer 
justifiable. In turn, President Caldera decided to fulfill his 
promise to rescind the suspension soon after these two taxes 
were promulgated. 
  [Begin Sosa recording] The reinstatement of economic 
guarantees is not that significant in and of itself, because 
Venezuelans survived without such guarantees for 30 years. 
Nevertheless, this action is significant because it proves to 
various economic sectors that they can maintain confidence in 
the government's promises and its deeds. The government said it 
was going to do something, and it followed through on its 
promise. I believe this move has enormous significance. [end 
recording] 
  Sosa also expressed confidence that the dollar might fall 
below 150 bolivares. Sosa added that he hopes the psychological 
effects that triggered a rise in the price of the dollar will 
come to an end and, in turn, prompt the stabilization of the 
foreign exchange market. 
  Sosa said that as a result of his recent trip to the United 
States, delegations from the Inter-American Development Bank 
[IDB], World Bank, and IMF will soon visit Venezuela. He also 
indicated that IDB representatives will assist the government in 
planning a very important social housing program. The World Bank 
delegation will arrive in Venezuela on 13 June to consult with 
Venezuelan officials on the financial crisis. The IMF delegation 
will examine fiscal problems projected to occur within the 
1994-1996 period.

Batista from the post of economic reform minister. 
  [Briceno] OCI Director Guillermo Alvarez Bajares has 
provided 
the information but declined to comment on the reasons that 
prompted Batista to resign, as contained in a letter addressed 
to President Rafael Caldera. Alvarez has said the president will 
not appoint a new minister for this portfolio, and he dismissed 
the possibility that Batista's resignation reflects a serious 
crisis within the economic cabinet. He contradicted himself in 
this regard when he said there were differences of opinion with 
the former head of the Reform of the National Economy Ministry. 
  [Begin Alvarez recording] It is clear, and you have cited 
the 
fact on many occasions, certain differences within the economic 
cabinet emerged some weeks ago; this is something one cannot 
hide. As I said at the beginning, we have sought to help in this 
way to make the president and the economic cabinet demonstrate 
to the country a coherence greater than the one they have been 
exhibiting thus far. This conflicts with the differences that 
have caused some damage to the image of the country in terms of 
image and opinion. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Maria Lilibeth Da Corte from the "Union Radio </F>
News" newscast] 
  [Text] Interior Minister Ramon Escovar has embarked on a 
campaign to reform the Interior Ministry--a campaign that 
includes the restriction of gun licenses, the elimination of 
certain permits, and the recovery of illegal weapons, as well as 
a crusade to train citizens on bearing arms. 
  [Begin recording] [Escovar] We want to expedite the issuance 
of gun licenses, remove middlemen from the process of issuing 
them, and make people pay what the law stipulates, instead of 
paying for bribes, which trigger illegal gunrunning in the 
country. In other words, we want to moralize the Interior 
Ministry's services, as well as increase its control. The 
Interior Ministry must control this issue. No other Venezuelan 
authority can issue gun licenses. This is what the law 
stipulates, and the law must be enforced. 
  [Da Corte] Would you please explain to us why the population 
should see the issuance of gun licenses as something that has 
gone awry? Those who want to bear arms should be able to. This 
does not necessarily mean people are going to start killing one 
another. 
  [Escovar] Of course not. Those who have gun licenses do not 
kill; usually it is only those who lack gun licenses. On the 
other hand, the legal and peaceful use of arms is a discipline 
that must be taught to the people; it is part of public 
education campaigns. It is also part of democracy, but so far we 
have failed to accomplish this goal. Therefore, we must strive 
to accomplish it. In a national emergency, we cannot let 
peaceful citizens go unarmed while criminals and thieves are 
armed. [end recording] 
  The head of the Interior Ministry also listed some measures 
that will be adopted shortly, including the expediting of the 
issuance of gun licenses and removing middlemen from the process 
of obtaining gun licenses, as well as exerting effective control 
on the issuance of gun licenses.

    [Editorial Report] Lima LA REPUBLICA in Spanish on 18 May 
1994, pages 16 and 17, carries a 1700-word article dated 17 May 
by Eladio Arcaya who evaluates the armed strike ordered by the 
Shining Path, SL, to commemorate the 14th anniversary of its 
first "terrorist" action. 
  For the first time in 14 years, the people of the Upper 
Huallaga region did not obey the armed strike ordered by the SL. 
They went about their business as usual in the midst of an 
impressive deployment of combined police and Army security 
forces along the Marginal highway from Tingo Maria to Aucayacu. 
Officials ordered a curfew in Pucayacu from 2100 to 0600 after 
four people were murdered on 15 May by an SL unit that looted 
the town, taking food and medicine. The SL unit came from Upper 
Pucayacu where it has a camp. A military patrol with help from 
the population cleaned "subversive" slogans from the walls in 
Madre Mia. 
  The peasants no longer fear the armed strike and went to 
work 
the land. Others opened their businesses, took their children to 
school, and carried out their normal activities like any other 
day. 
  Lima LA REPUBLICA in Spanish on 18 May 1994, page 17, 
carries 
an unattributed 800-word article on the "total failure" of the 
SL armed strike ordered in Lima. The people paid no attention to 
the call and went to work as usual. Despite some cuts in the 
public transportation system because bus owners wanted to 
protect their units early in the morning, most Lima residents 
managed to get to work. Police and Army units patrolled roads 
and highways. Some "subversives" managed only to throw a few 
firecrackers. Security forces captured five "subversives" and 
confiscated weapons and explosives. In the San Juan de 
Lurigancho district, the Army provided buses to take passangers 
to the university campus. Early on the morning of 17 May a bomb 
exploded at the Interbanc branch in the San Martin de Porres 
district. On the same day at 1400, policemen of the Pachacutec 
Police Post arrested three alleged "terrorists" who reportedly 
murdered a woman who was selling fruit in the market of San Juan 
de Miraflores. The police found two 9-mm Browning pistols in 
their posession.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 1 Jun (DPA) -- The Colombian 
Government indicated today that it will not reconsider its order 
to the Armed Forces to shoot down planes that might be carrying 
drugs -- an order which permits the use of force in intercepting 
hostile planes -- in response to a U.S. move to stop supplying 
data from radar installations that monitor Colombian and 
Peruvian airspace. 
  Colombian Defense Minister Rafael Pardo said the Colombian 
Government's order was carefully reviewed within the context of 
existing international civil aviation regulations, and, 
therefore, "we do not have to change anything in this matter." 
  The controversy in Colombia and Peru began when it was 
revealed that the U.S. Department of Defense, without consulting 
either the Colombian or Peruvian Governments, suspended the 
operation of radars located in the Amazon jungle because it 
believed it was dangerous for the Armed Forces of the two 
countries to be authorized to shoot down planes. 
  Spokesmen for President Cesar Gaviria's government reacted 
angrily to the move, calling it "unilateral, untimely, and 
rude." They also argued that it could represent a U.S. violation 
of agreements signed with Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru during the 
so-called Antinarcotics Summits held in Cartagena de Indias and 
San Antonio (Texas). 
  Pardo said the Colombian Government believes it is acting 
properly, and he added that it is still awaiting an official 
answer from the United States on the reasons behind this U.S. 
move before deciding whether it will ask the United States to 
remove two radar installations located in Leticia and Araracuara 
in the Amazon region. 
  According to unofficial reports published in Colombia, the 
Pentagon's decision was unilateral and prompted concern in the 
White House and State Department because it might lead to an 
increase in drug flights into the United States. 
  Colombian aviation officials who were consulted by the media 
indicated that the U.S. measure might have arisen from fear that 
one of the many U.S. military planes which "constantly violate" 
Colombian airspace might be shot down. 
  Asked about the decision to suspend the release of radar 
data, Army Commander Major General Hernan Guzman said 
authorities will continue to comply with the order to down 
hostile planes because "while fulfilling our duty, we cannot be 
concerned with what the Americans have to say." 
  The controversy heightened criticisms from Colombian 
political sectors against what they have called 
"inconsistencies" in the Clinton administration's drug policy 
because, several months ago, the U.S. State Department stopped 
forwarding evidence against drug traffickers after a 
disagreement erupted over statements made by Colombian 
Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff.

<F P=106> [Report by Isabella Recio from the "Seven O'Clock Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] Christine Shelly, spokeswoman for the U.S. State 
Department's Bureau of International Narcotics Matters, has 
announced that a final decision is not expected before next week 
regarding U.S.-Colombian cooperation on information provided by 
U.S. radar installations in Leticia and Araracuara. Defense 
Minister Rafael Pardo and Air Force Commander Major General 
Alfonso Abondano commented on this topic today at a military 
ceremony. 
  During the ceremony to commemorate the 87th anniversary of 
the Cadets Military Academy, in addition to the traditional 
speeches and parades, there was time to discuss the U.S. radar 
dispute. Amid a downpour that resembled the storm now brewing 
in the country following the Pentagon's orders to suspend the 
operation of the two radar installations, Pardo discounted the 
U.S. position on whether or not unidentified planes should be 
shot down. 
  [Begin Pardo recording] The thing we oppose is that this 
decision was made unilaterally, despite the fact that this 
cooperation program has been in place for three years and that 
it has been a multilateral program. [end recording] 
  According to the defense minister, Colombia will continue to 
shoot down unidentified drug planes, and this policy will not 
change. 
  [Begin Pardo recording] Colombia has assumed this position 
following a thorough, 18-month legal review. We are very much 
convinced that our interpretation is correct, and we sincerely 
believe we have nothing to change in this regard. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, the Colombian Air Force says the chances of a 
U.S. 
military plane being shot down are remote. 
  [Begin Abondano recording] We identify all planes visually 
before our pilots are authorized to shoot. [end recording]

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 31 May (DPA) -- The Colombian 
Government today issued a decree restricting the possession and 
consumption of narcotics in public places. This practice was 
recently authorized by a Constitutionality Court ruling, which 
concluded that it is illegal to apply jail sentences and fines 
to individuals found to be in possession of personal doses of 
drugs. 
  Today's announcement was made by Justice Minister Andres 
Gonzalez, who said the decree includes several provisions 
designed to challenge the high court's controversial ruling. 
The decision was rejected by the government, political circles, 
economic groups, the media, and several social circles. 
  Gonzalez indicated that the authorities will prohibit the 
consumption of drugs in public places. Those who violate the 
measure will be removed from the premises. The owner of the 
establishment will be punished with the closure of his or her 
business and the suspension of his or her operators license. 
  The minister said the use of drugs will not be permitted in 
places such as schools; cultural, recreation, and amusement 
centers; on board ships and airplanes; in restaurants; or on the 
street. 
  In the realm of sports, Gonzalez said the decree, which was 
signed by President Cesar Gaviria, also prohibits the use of 
drugs by athletes attempting to improve their performance. The 
authorities will apply stiff penalties to violators, their 
trainers, and the doctors who endorse such consumption. 
  Gonzales added that operators of motor vehicles and airplane 
pilots found to be under the effects of narcotics will have 
their licenses suspended. Those appearing for work under the 
influence will be fired. 
  The decree is the first practical measure adopted by 
President Gaviria to head off the Constitutionality Court 
ruling, which legalized the possession and consumption of drugs. 
The court based its decision on the right that all Colombians 
have, as outlined in the Constitution, to freely develop their 
individual personality. The ruling annulled an article of the 
Drug Law that mandated jail terms of 30 days to one year and 
fines equivalent to $62 for those individuals caught carrying 
quantities of less than 20 grams of marijuana, 5 grams of 
hashish, 2 grams of methaqualone, and 1 gram of cocaine. 
  In rejecting the ruling, Gaviria said the Constitutionality 
Court was mistaken to call drug consumption a "right" and to 
establish the supremacy of individual interests over public 
welfare. Several days ago, Gaviria indicated that his 
administration will promote a referendum to have the Colombian 
people decide for themselves whether or not to reform the 
constitutional article that provides the right to individual 
personality development, which would automatically annul the 
court's decision. To this end, Gaviria signed a law on 
mechanisms for a popular consultation. The law authorizes the 
government to promote and present motions that are signed by 
several million citizens before Congress to request referendums. 
  Several justices of the Constitutionality Court have 
criticized the president's attempts to prevent the legalization 
of drug use. They say their decisions are not subject to appeal 
and must be upheld. Meanwhile, an association of criminal 
lawyers has complained before Congress about the president's 
alleged "contempt" of court.

<F P=106> [Interview with Andres Pastrana and Luis Fernando Ramirez </F>
Acuna, Colombian New Democratic Force presidential and vice 
presidential candidates, by Caracol news director Dario 
Arizmendi and unidentified reporters at the station's studios in 
Santa Fe de Bogota; from "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast; 
monitored in progress -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Pastrana] ...[passage indistinct] it is incredible 
how high the abstention rate was. That is where the votes are. 
These are the people to whom we have to appeal. There are 
proposals from Antonio Navarro [leader of the 19 April Movement 
Democratic Alliance], from Miguel Alfredo Maza [leader of the 
National Civic Consensus], from various candidates whose line 
coincides to a good extent with my government program. I am 
looking for Colombians and asking them to vote on 19 June. I am 
very concerned about this abstentionism. The people are going 
to soccer games; they are going to the World Cup. We must 
continue calling on the Colombian people because the Colombia's 
future path will be in their hands on 19 June. 
  [Arizmendi] Dr. Pastrana, your government platform is well 
known. I suppose you have analyzed that of Dr. Antonio Navarro. 
What points of agreement could lead you, as you have hinted, to 
find points in common between the two platforms? 
  [Pastrana] Basically, fighting corruption. I think Navarro 
wants to fight corruption. I think that the corruption issue is 
the main thing we have in common right now. Logically, the 
issue of peace is too, even though his positions are somewhat 
different from what I have been proposing. But I think he 
understands my positions well. Basically, fighting corruption 
is the main thing we have in common. 
  [Arizmendi] Do you think that Navarro's votes could attract 
many voters to your political movement, or will many 
Conservatives tend to be put off? 
  [Pastrana] I think we must develop a new mentality in the 
country. [Words indistinct] at first everybody wondered how 
they were going to get Regina Betancourt's [leader of the 
Metapolitical Unitary Movement], or Navarro's, or Maza's votes. 
I think this is a mistake. I think the country wants a big 
coalition, a coalition for Colombia. We are addressing all 
Colombians. We have to seek out those who abstained. If there 
is integration, a programmatic agreement, fine, but right now I 
am flirting with the abstentionists. There is where I am 
directing all my efforts. I am telling young people, women, 
Colombians in general that the election results are in their 
hands. I am directing my efforts at them. 
  [Arizmendi] Are you seeking Navarro out or are you going to 
wait for him to seek you out? 
  [Pastrana] If there is identification with Navarro, I 
obviously hope there will be a decision from them. I think the 
Democratic Alliance wants to hold a convention or a meeting or 
to use a mechanism that will enable it to decide with which 
program it identifies itself. But meanwhile, I continue working 
to try to win over a large segment that still exists in our 
country. That is where I am centering all my efforts and 
enthusiasm. 
  [Arizmendi] I imagine you identify more with General Maza. 
  [Pastrana] Yes, we have been talking with Maza. But Dario, I 
think that more than with Maza, Navarro, Regina, we have to look 
into what identifies us. I have a government program (?which 
proposes a change). What I am telling the Colombians, including 
Navarro, Maza, Regina, and each and every candidate who 
participated, is that if there are points of convergence in our 
programs, I am willing to sit down and discuss these points in 
my own program which we want to implement on 7 August. What the 
country is tired of seeing is that all coalitions have their 
bureaucratic side. The country says: Here come the same ones 
with the same thing. What they seek is positions; what they want 
is to get votes to reach the presidency. That is what we have 
to end. That is what we have to change. My proposal is one of 
change. If it was old-style politics and machinery that were 
defeated this last Sunday, I can hardly make use of old-style 
politics and machinery. I represent a completely different 
alternative. 
  [Arizmendi] Abstentionism reached about 68 percent. You 
have said you are making every effort to try and reduce this 
abstentionism and to try and win over millions of indifferent 
voters. How will you do it? What is your strategy? 
  [Pastrana] I think this is important. Sunday, the people did 
not believe that change can happen. But it has become evident, 
and the media is beginning to sense this, that there is a chance 
for change and that the country can change. This is why I 
believe that on 19 June, the people will support me and Luis 
Fernando Ramirez, our presidential ticket, because the people 
realize now that change can happen, that the machinery can be 
defeated, that old-style politics can be defeated. This is why 
I am asking those who voted for me Sunday to vote for me one 
more time, one more time for Andres. I am sure that all 
Colombians can make change possible. 
  [Arizmendi] You are asking for just 2.5 million votes. 
  [Pastrana] One more time would be fine. 
  [Arizmendi] Will it be necessary to change your program? 
Will the campaign change? Something will have to change 
because the first round in the election showed that apathetic 
voters were not motivated. 
  [Pastrana] I think that those who voted for us did realize 
that the change can happen, something nobody believed before. I 
think this is what will stir apathetic voters: the strategy we 
want for Colombians. We are going to change Colombia. I am 
sure they are going to vote because they have seen that change 
can happen, and we are going to effect the change. In whose 
hands is it? In the hands of all the Colombian people. This is 
why I am asking them to support me on 19 June because change is 
in the hands of the Colombians. It is not in the hands of 
Andres or Luis Fernando. No. It is in the hands of the 
Colombians. It has been shown that change can happen. Now the 
consolidation of this position depends on them. 
  [Arizmendi] You like soccer as much as the rest of the 
Colombians. What will happen on 19 June, when three of the most 
interesting soccer games are scheduled? 
  [Pastrana] I was looking at the schedule. Javier told me 
about it. I say that all those games will be rotten compared to 
the game we will be playing in Colombia. 
  [Arizmendi] Are you playing for the home team or the 
visitors? 
  [Pastrana] I will be on the home team. I think the country 
has to realize that they must go out and vote on that day. The 
people must understand that we have to make the change. The 
truth is that we have to appeal to everybody. We must 
consolidate the ongoing democratic process. I know the voters 
are tired. Sometimes we think about that. We have had eight 
elections in four years. In a matter of four years, the people 
have voted eight times. I think that given that there is a 
chance for change, people will vote. I am sure that women, the 
elderly, men, Colombians in general, know that there is a chance 
to change the country, and they will vote. 
  [Arizmendi] Did you expect to win, tie, or lose Sunday's 
elections? 
  [Pastrana] I hoped to win last Sunday's elections. Dario, 
the truth is... [pauses] For me this is a victory. I think that 
when reading the figures and statistics, many Colombians will be 
perplexed because they thought there were large differences in 
many regions of Colombia. I think the country supported me; the 
country understood my message. There are important aspects, 
such as the case of Antioquia, where we obtained impressive 
suport, and the case of the coastal region, which also supported 
us. They understood my direct message to the coastal region. 
This holds true for all regions of Colombia. I truly believe, 
Dario, from reviewing and analyzing electoral figures, Luis 
Fernando and I are very happy with the electoral results. 
  [Arizmendi] Don't you think you have scraped the pots and 
pans already? 
  [Pastrana] No, Dario. I think we are just getting started. 
I think there are places where we can still win many 
supporters. For example in Bogota. I hold the record in my 
party for the most number of votes in Bogota for the past 10 
years and the past four elections. I also think this is rising. 
I tried to win in Bogota; nevertheless, we got lots of votes, 
considering that this is very much a Liberal Party city. What 
we see, Dario, is that the voting strength the Liberal Party had 
in Santa Fe de Bogota has dropped to 63 percent. When Barco was 
a candidate, he got 705,000 votes. The lowest number of votes 
the Liberal Party has obtained in Bogota was with Samper. He 
obtained only 416,000 votes. The most narrow difference in 
Santa Fe de Bogota votes took place in this election. Belisario 
Betancur also got close to [words indistinct]. I am happy 
because the number of votes has been rising. I think there is 
still a lot to be harvested; a lot of work is still to be done 
in Bogota. 
  [Arizmendi] Are you analyzing Bogota's results with a 
discredited [words indistinct]. 
  [Pastrana] In our case, votes have been rising. You know 
that I won [the election for mayor of Bogota] with 330,000 
votes. This time, I got 60,000 or 50,000 more votes. I think 
there is much to be secured. There is still a lot to be done. 
You know that in politics, people want to be visited; they want 
you to be with them, to spend some time with them. This is why 
I think there is much to be reaped in Bogota. I am very 
optimistic about Santa Fe de Bogota. 
  [Reporter] During the campaign, some sectors accused you of 
being intolerant of religion because you criticized the fact 
that your political opponent was being accompanied by Christians 
ands Protestants. What do you think about freedom of religion? 
  [Pastrana] I totally agree with it. During the campaign, 
there were attacks I did not answer. I believe in freedom of 
religion. It is established in the Constitution. I respect the 
Constitution. Religious groups support us. There are the 
Christian Democrats, who since last week have supported us in 
this election campaign. I believe in freedom of religion. I am 
a Catholic, but I respect freedom of religion and the 
Constitution. 
  [Reporter] You have no objections. 
  [Pastrana] No objections. We invite all Colombians from all 
religions and creeds to support us in a government for all of 
us, without exclusion. 
  [Reporter] What do you think about election day restrictions 
on journalists and restrictions on information from abroad. You 
are a journalist. What do you think of the restrictions that 
were imposed? 
  [Pastrana] Electoral mechanisms have to be established. The 
government made a decision in this regard. I am satisfied with 
the information reported Sunday, not only reports in the media 
but also with the changes in the National Civil Registry. We 
did not think that the Registry was going to be as effective as 
it was. This also represents change. I think this contributed 
to prompt electoral information. I think the country was 
satisfied. By 2100, the country was informed of the results. 
  [Arizmendi] One thing is the delivery of reports, and we did 
acknowledge the fact that this was done in a timely, diligent, 
and very professional manner. Another is the fact that we were 
not able to interview you or other candidates, or political 
leaders, so that they could express their opinion on the results. 
  [Pastrana] This is probably an exaggeration. I think that 
reports are one thing and election results are something else. 
I think this is fine. I think, though, that a restriction so 
strict as to not allow the candidates to speak is too much. 
This has been noted by the foreign media. They said: Well, but 
we are here. We were not allowed to make our speeches at 2100. 
At 2100, we told the national government: The available data is 
valid because 97 percent of the votes are in. 
  If they want to lift the restrictions so that candidates may 
speak, we are prepared to agree. This is what we told the 
national government. The government said it would lift the 
restriction if both sides agree. As I told you, Dario, we 
believed the election results had been established, that the 
votes yet to be counted were minimal. But the restriction was 
not lifted. I do not know what the other side thinks. We were 
ready to have it lifted that very day. 
  I think it is good that candidates speak out and invite the 
people to vote, that the president and the ministers, that all 
Colombians who can contribute to encouraging people to vote may 
do so. The people are motivated by their leaders, the stars, 
the journalists. The people like to vote. I think this is good. 
  [Reporter] At 2100, you asked the government to lift the 
restriction. Did the government invite you to participate in 
the decision on the restriction, the limitations, the 
restrictions imposed on the media that day? 
  [Pastrana] The truth is that I was not at that meeting, 
Edgar, and I do not know if that subject was discussed. Once a 
good percentage of the votes is in, I do not see why we cannot 
speak. Besides, I think this is good for the country. For the 
first time, we are going to have a second round. The idea is 
that whoever won the first round could speak to his voters and 
thank them and make some proposals, if they so wished. Clear 
information was available. 
  [Reporter] You think the government [words indistinct]? 
  [Pastrana] [Words indistinct] I believe the government will 
issue a second invitation to the two candidates to review this. 
I believe this [words indistinct] the national government. 
  [Arizmendi] Dr. Pastrana, we have completed the first 15 
minutes and 33 seconds. We will break for commercials now; we 
will be back. [six-minute break for commercials] 
  We are at the main studios of Colombia's Emisoras Caracol 
talking to Dr. Andres Pastrana Arango. His running mate, Dr. 
Luis Fernando Ramirez, is also here. Welcome, Dr. Ramirez. 
  [Ramirez] Good morning, Dario. I am happy to be here. 
Special greetings to Caracol's audience. 
  [Arizmendi] During the previous phase of the campaign, you 
said that swing voters and independent voters would vote for Dr. 
Andres Pastrana and for you, Dr. Ramirez. But many experts 
believe, according to what we have read in the papers and heard 
via the media, that swing voters, specifically in Bogota, sided 
with Dr. Ernesto Samper. How do you view this and last Sunday's 
results? 
  [Ramirez] About the swing voters, I think, regarding what 
happened last Sunday, that in the polls, the people were asked 
two questions. One was: For whom do you plan to vote? That is, 
the people were asked about their intentions. In some polls, 
Samper came out the winner and others had Andres as the winner. 
In other polls, there was a tie. 
  There was another question: Who do you think will be the 
next 
president? Here, Samper used to win systematically. The voters 
believed that regardless of how the people voted, for this or 
that candidate, the machinery would impose Dr. Samper. This is 
now completely changed. I believe that in the second round of 
the election, if the people are asked again who will be the next 
president, I am sure that now, the people think it will be 
Andres Pastrana. 
  Thanks to what happened Sunday, Colombians now are sure that 
their votes count and that all votes are needed to effect a 
change. This is why Andres Pastrana has proposed that each of 
the 2.5 million Colombians who voted for him secure an 
additional vote for him. I am not optimistic enough to believe 
that each one will secure one vote. But, let us say, Dario, 
that 10 percent of these 2.5 million people, that is, 250,000 
people, do secure one vote. The abstention rate has been very 
high and obtaining 250,000 additional votes is not an 
inconceivable task. The 250,000 votes will allow us to win in 
the second round of the election. Here is where the biggest 
resources lie. This is why Andres has said we are more 
interested in talking to the voters than to certain leaders. 
Undoubtedly, 10 percent of the people voted for the minorities 
-- for Maza, for Parejo [leader of the National Democratic 
Alternative], for Regina, for Navarro. 
  It is important to channel the feelings of 10 percent of the 
Colombians who did not find clear solutions in Dr. Andres 
Pastrana's or Dr. Samper's platforms. This is why we have 
demonstrated our receptivity to the idea of incorporating the 
positions and the concerns of this minority, of this 10 percent 
of Colombians, into our platform so they can feel represented. 
This is our task. This is why we feel we will do better with 
the swing vote in the second round of the election. 
  [Reporter] Dr. Pastrana, Dr. Ramirez's answer makes evident 
that the voters were not convinced there were going to be 
changes. The people want changes but do not believe changes are 
possible. Could it be that it is very difficult to convince 
voters that something is going to change in the country when 
they see that the candidates continue calling themselves 
Liberals and Conservatives, which is what people want to forget? 
In spite of the swing vote that could have gone to your side 
and the votes of the conservative parties [words indistinct] you 
remain tied to the past which the people want to forget? 
  [Pastrana] In my case, efforts have been made to put me in a 
corral, like cattle, and brand me with an iron reading 
Conservative Party. I think the supraparty candidacy I have 
been espousing is what won the votes. Thanks to this supraparty 
candidacy we were able to win Sunday's victory when 
Conservatives, Liberals, and independents supported us. They 
will continue supporting us in this election process. I do not 
believe it is not that we were unable to convoke the country. 
The people were afraid. The people did not know if change was 
possible in the face of what has been interpreted as the 
machinery, as old-style politics. I think the country saw that 
change is possible and for this reason came out and voted. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Pastrana] I am not married to the Conservative Party. That 
party supports me. The Liberal Party also supports me, 
according to the polls. The independents support us. 
Colombians support us. Mine is not a party candidacy. Mine is a 
supraparty candidacy. Dr. Samper has only convoked his party. 
The media reported today that Dr. Samper will convoke only 
people in the Liberal Party. My position is different. I am 
convoking all Colombians. I continue my supraparty campaign. I 
have the support of the Conservative Party, of the Liberals, and 
of the independents, and we will continue a supraparty policy. 
I am sure that this is what the people want, and we will win on 
19 June. 
  [Arizmendi] According to the National Civil Registry, you 
got 2.5 million votes. How many of these do you think are 
Conservative and how many from other political forces? 
  [Pastrana] I will answer that by giving you figures, Dario. 
The people wonder: What is a party apparatus? The Conservative 
Party won 1.5 million votes in the congressional elections. I 
secured 2.5 million votes. 
  [Arizmendi] In past presidential elections, the Conservative 
candidate obtained 2.1 million votes. 
  [Pastrana] We are talking about these elections. 
  [Reporter] Are the two elections comparable? 
  [Pastrana] If we were to compare them, we can see that we 
have 400,000 more votes. At this moment we have approximately 
500,000 more votes, which amounts to the sum of the votes of the 
National Salvation Movement and of Rodrigo Lloreda in 1990. 
  [Reporter] There are new Conservatives now? 
  [Pastrana] I think they are independent. I think this sector 
is switching. It has been estimated that between 14 and 20 
percent of the Liberals supported me. All polls indicated this. 
There were many independent votes too. [Words indistinct] if 
we add the election results of Dr. Alvaro Gomez and [words 
indistinct] we would be somewhere around 400,000 votes and 
[words indistinct] Dr. Samper's figures decreased. If we 
compare the election of Dr. Gaviria in 1990 and the 1994 
election [words indistinct]. 
  [Reporter] Don't you think you are being unfair with old 
Conservative Party bosses who helped you win in some 
departments? How can we fail to acknowledge Omar Yepes' 
cooperation in Caldas, or that of Cornelio Reyes, who was 
president of the Conservative Party Directorate; of Fabio 
Valencia, who surely contributed to the victory in Antioquia? 
They are the old political class, the old Conservative 
apparatus. How will the change affect them? 
  [Pastrana] The country knows that the Conservatives in this 
apparatus sided with Dr. Samper and there they are. A new 
country is on our side. This country has acknowledged this in 
me. 
  [Reporter] Tell us about Yepes and Fabio Valencia. 
  [Pastrana] I have the names of many Liberals: Bernardo 
Gaitan, Alfonso Luis Guerra, Maria Paulina Espinoza. The 
different aspect of our supraparty movement is that our 
Conservative and Liberal party friends and our independent 
friends are proposing the change. This is where the change is. 
The old Conservative Party apparatus is not supporting me. It 
went over to Dr. Samper. 
  We envision a new country, a country of changes, and this is 
why we secured Sunday's victory. This was possible thanks to 
all our efforts, those of the country and [words indistinct] in 
many regions of the country, like the ones you mentioned, but 
also, in the case of Santander, for example, Luis Fernando 
secured a large number of voters. No one is giving Luis 
Fernando credit for this. I think this should be acknowledged. 
  This is what we have been trying to establish: the 
difference 
between the old-style and new-style politics. When I was mayor 
I proposed a movement greater than the Conservative Party. As 
presidential candidate, I am proposing a supraparty movement 
working with the New Democratic Force. This is what has 
characterized me. The country sometimes wonders: Why does Andres 
support eight unknown senators? This is what an important 
Colombian magazine said when we made a new offer. I think we 
have seen that change is possible and that those who sought 
reelection were reelected to Congress. Something is clear: The 
country is definitely going to vote for the change we are 
proposing. 
  [Reporter] Dr. Pastrana, you have acknowledged the fact that 
you have received more support than the Conservative Party 
during the congressional elections, and that Dr. Samper obtained 
less votes than Liberalism obtained in the congressional 
elections. 
  [Pastrana] The Liberals have said Pastrana was [word 
indistinct] by the apparatus, but not Samper. I have not said 
the Liberal Party was defeated. Samperism was defeated. These 
are two different things. I have been insisting on this. 
[Words indistinct] with Andres Pastrana. 
  I have even proposed that if the chief of the Liberal Party 
is Dr. Samper, I will reach an undersstanding with him. That 
decision will logically have to be made by the Liberal Party. 
Should Dr. Samper continue to be the leader of the Liberal 
Party, as opposed to what [words indistinct] Samper proposed, I 
am indeed willing to talk and hold a dialogue with the Liberal 
Party. I am willing to talk and to govern with the Liberal 
Party, perhaps even do better than that. 
  [Arizmendi] Half and half? 
  [Pastrana] I do not know that yet, Dario. I think that to 
speak of figures now... [pauses] maybe more or maybe less. I 
have even proposed that all control organizations be in the 
hands of the Liberal Party. In proposing three people for 
comptroller, or for president of the Supreme Court, I would 
forward the names of Liberals. I would nominate them. Let us 
hope that control organizations are in the hands of [word 
indistinct] the party, the president. The people like 
transparency. I personally believe that [words indistinct] to 
supervise a company, management. I think that what the country 
wants is that control organizations be in the hands of the party 
in opposition to the president, [words indistinct]. 
  [Arizmendi] [Words indistinct] majority in Congress. 
  [Pastrana] It does not matter. These are lists with three 
candidates on each, forwarded by the president. I could forward 
the list with the names of Conservative Party members, but 
[words indistinct] other parties. In my case, if I become 
president, I will send the lists of three candidates to 
Congress, which will be made up of Liberals. 
  [Reporter] Dr. Pastrana, is political affiliation what makes 
a politician honest and virtuous? There is the case of the 
prosecutor general and the attorney general. They are Liberals, 
and they have proven that they are excellent officials who have 
earned the highest regard [words indistinct]. 
  [Pastrana] I think the people are more at ease, and this is 
important. I saw this in the office of the mayor of Bogota. 
The fact that the Comptroller's Office was in the hands of the 
Liberal Party produced a feeling of much calm and honesty. 
  I think there should be a constitutional tenet establishing 
that control organizations should be in the hands of the 
opposition party. Personally speaking, I believe this would be 
very healthy for democracy. 
  [Reporter] Would you propose changes to the Constitution 
that 
would effect this? 
  [Pastrana] I think I would. I like the idea. I like it 
because it gives me peace of mind. I think this is true for the 
country also. 
  [Reporter] In a few minutes we are going to discuss economic 
matters. 
  [Pastrana] And politics too. [six-minute break for 
commercials] 
  [Arizmendi] Dr. Andres Pastrana is on "Caracol's 0600 to 
0900" program today accompanied by his running mate in the 
second round of elections, Luis Fernando Ramirez. 
  Dr. Pastrana, what about televised debates? Are you prepared 
to debate Dr. Ernesto Samper face-to-face? 
  [Pastrana] Yes. I think there will be two debates. I am 
prepared for debates. I think they are good. We are open to 
them. I think they are healthy. The law, or a government 
decree, establishes that two debates should be held. I would 
like to see and the country wants a debate between the vice 
presidential candidates, between Dr. Luis Fernando Ramirez and 
Dr. De la Calle, because they have waged a biased campaign 
against Dr. Ramirez, and I think it is good that the people 
should get to know him. The people have started to get to know 
him in the short time during which he has been campaigning. The 
people know about his experience and his abilities. I think the 
country should know about who might succeed Dr. Sotero or Dr. 
[words indistinct]. I think [words indistinct] until the 
country gets to know them too. I think that after the first 
debate between Dr. Samper and Andres [words indistinct]. 
  [Arizmendi] But in addition to the two hours the state 
grants, there are also the opinion columns and time... 
  [Pastrana, interrupting] I think it is worthwhile to see 
these. I think there should be clear rules. I am prepared for 
that. I like them. We are prepared for that, Dario. I think 
this is important. 
  [Arizmendi] Fine. Now after having invited you, I will 
speak to Dr. Samper about a face-to-face program with you, and, 
of course, about a face-to-face between Dr. Luis Ramirez and Dr. 
Humberto De la Calle within eight days. 
  Here is another question, Dr. Andres Pastrana. What role 
will 
people like Fabio Valencia and Omar Yepes play in your 
government? 
  [Pastrana] Right now they are very important people who 
continue helping from the Senate. They are prohibited from 
holding any government post. They were elected and have served 
their regions. That is what we see in the election results. 
The electorate punishes those who do not give them or their 
regions possibilities for growth or development. I think the 
Valencia and Yepes voters have recognized their work and 
progress. If there is something that impresses me when I tour 
the country, it is seeing how grateful people are to those who 
have served their regions. 
  They and others will become very important actors from 
Congress. They have significant experience in Congress. With 
my Conservative and Liberal friends in Congress, with the 
independents in Congress, we will continue activities to push 
forward all those bills that are important to the country. 
Sometimes people wonder if the Liberals controlling Congress 
will block Pastrana, but I think not. I think Congress has 
changed. We have seen, in different laws and ways, that there 
is no room for partisan politics when it is a matter of laws 
that are important to Colombia. The Conservative and Liberal 
Parties do not [words indistinct] simply because it is a law 
submitted by a Liberal or ultrapartisan government, or a 
Conservative [words indistinct] all of Colombia is represented 
there. Rather, the entire Republic is not represented there 
because of the districts [words indistinct] it is truly sad it 
is called Congress or Senate of the Republic, and yet the 
Republic is not represented in the Senate of the Republic. 
  If I learned anything during the time I served in Congress, 
it is that lawmakers (?do think) of the country and work for 
Colombia. There are major amendments that [words indistinct] 
(?such) as the amendment to Law 100, and the [words indistinct] 
a consensus was reached and an amendment that was important for 
the country was approved. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Pastrana] Not when Congress works. If you look at what 
Congress has done, you see that it approved the law against 
kidnappings and the Social Security Reform Law. Important laws 
are being implemented. I cannot recall any of them offhand, but 
I think Congress has worked and must continue working in that 
fashion. I think Congress closes ranks when it knows what 
benefits the country. It is simply not going to block any law 
submitted by a particular government. Congress has a different 
view of the country. It is aware of its responsibility. It is 
aware that the image it must have before the people is one of 
work and service to the community. I think partisan aspects 
are often set aside to work for the country. 
  [Reporter] Commenting on the television debate and your 
encounter with candidate Samper, the consensus almost seems to 
be that if Samper did not win it, there was at least a tie, 
although you were expected to trounce him in that televised 
debate. Some feel this confirmed that newsmen know a little 
about everything but lack depth. You are a newsman. Andres 
Pastrana, you are being criticized for that, for your lack of 
experience and depth, lack of in-depth knownledge of economic 
topics, perhaps, and for not being mature because of your age, 
perhaps, since you are not as old as the other candidate. How 
do you respond? 
  [Pastrana] Honestly, the first thing I would say is that I 
am 
not an economist. I am aware of economic issues, and I approach 
them in a somewhat different manner. Just look at what came out 
of the debate. Samper Pizano wanted an economic debate. Yet 
the way things turned out, I was rated as good an economist as 
he was by the polls in the media. Where he said he was better 
than I was [words indistinct] however, polls conducted during 
those days by economists rated Dr. Samper and Andres Pastrana 
alike. Then, truthfully speaking now, I acknowledge that [words 
indistinct]. I believe, however, I was able to obtain the 
substance which is precisely where the country graded me as good 
an economist as he [words indistinct]. 
  [Reporter] SEMANA magazine published a phrase related to 
some of your proposals which, in all honesty... 
  [Pastrana, interrupting] ... out of context, Edgar. If it is 
out of context, Edgar, you know I... [pauses]. You know I am a 
journalist. You are also a journalist and know that if 
something is published out of context it is very difficult, 
especially with just a minute to answer. If the entire sentence 
is not published, obviously this can be very misleading. If any 
article of the Constitution is not read in context, the article 
can be quite puzzling, as you correctly pointed out. Thus, I 
believe things must be read in their correct context, not simply 
read as isolated phrases. I believe this must also be taken 
into account. 
  [Reporter] Dr. Pastrana, what is your proposal for ending 
mandatory military service? In particular, what do you intend 
to do to end mandatory military service while financing a 
professional Armed Forces? 
  [Pastrana] Look, I personally believe that there are clear 
differences between Dr. Samper and me. I believe he stated on 
"Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast that he does not support an 
end to mandatory military service. I propose putting an end to 
mandatory military service. Little by little, the country must 
professionalize the Armed Forces. How are we going to do this? 
By investing, investing resources that will allow us to 
professionalize the Armed Forces. There are currently 23,000 
professionals [words indistinct] Armed Forces by 11,000 
additional men before the end of his term. It is being 
suggested that between now and the year 2000, we must find the 
resources to have 33,000 new policemen; of these, 23,000 will be 
for the urban areas and approximately 13,000 for the rural 
areas. I do not think the country should continue sacrificing 
its best men, the youth, by sending them to fight truly 
professionals. This is something that the country will have to 
sit down and think about. The country must decide whether these 
youths, just out of high school and with a few months of 
training, can be sent out to fight men with real experience. If 
the guerrillas do not show a will for peace, then the country 
will have to confront them with professionals and not with 
youths who are not qualified to fight them. 
  We plan to apply this to all sectors. In any case, Carlos, 
the younger generation must be offered the opportunity to get 
involved in some type of community service. It is not that the 
younger generation will develop without any type of 
responsibility. They must interact in their respective 
communities; they can participate in teaching programs or work 
in other community activities. I am not sure Carlos and Dario, 
if sometimes [words indistinct]. I believe they still have a 
lot to offer. I also believe that the young generation is 
willing to give a lot more. They are not interested in just 
standing around on street corners. I maintain that this is the 
direction in which we must orient the country. That is why I 
propose to move ahead little by little in progressively ending 
mandatory military service. Anyone who wants to participate in 
this program... [pauses] There might be those who would rather 
go through with their military service because they like it and 
believe it is the best way to serve the nation. I understand, 
however, the anguish Colombian mothers are experiencing knowing 
that they only have one child who is about to finish high 
school; they have no one else to help them, and their children 
are being sent to the jungle to get killed by those who are 
better trained. 
  [Reporter] Dr. Pastrana, it is time for us to take a break. 
We will be back soon. [six-minute break for commercials] 
  We continue our interview with Dr. Andres Pastrana Arango 
and 
Luis Fernando Ramirez. We now turn to economic issues. 
  Dr. Pastrana, it has been suggested that nowhere in your 
presidential platform are there clear indications of what your 
position with respect to wages actually is. Do you support 
increasing wages in general as a way of stimulating demand, thus 
encouraging productivity throughout the country? 
  [Pastrana] Let us start with the wage base. First, we have 
to return wages to their real value. What I have been proposing 
is that we must start looking after the basic staples basket. 
To accomplish this, we must bring inflation down. Wages must 
once again revert to their real value. The country cannot 
continue with the 18 and 20 percent wage increases we had in the 
last months of the previous year, the 22 percent rise in utility 
costs, and the 23 percent rise in gasoline prices in the first 
months of the year. What we currently have is that the wage 
increase obtained by Colombian workers during the first part of 
the year has been lost. 
  [Reporter] What would you do to break the circle? 
  [Pastrana] I believe the best way to do this would be by 
fighting inflation. We must channel efforts in this direction. 
Wages must return to normal levels. The government must 
implement an efficient spending program. Nearly [words 
indistinct] percent is a result of government spending. We must 
have some concepts straight. First, as stipulated by the 
Constitution, the Board of Directors of the Banco de la 
Republica is completely independent and is currently responsible 
for fighting inflation. But I believe that to a large extent, 
the government is also responsible for fighting inflation, and 
that commitment is reflected in controlling spending. 
  [Reporter] Would you cut public spending by increasing 
public 
investments? 
  [Pastrana] Exactly. What I have been proposing is a cut in 
public spending and to give priority attention to the deficit. 
What we see when we analyze Colombia's budget is, as I have 
been saying, that we have been going from insignificant project 
to insignificant project. At this stage of my campaign, I have 
a very select group of professionals working on how we can cut 
public spending, how we can select those projects that are 
important to the country and complete them. It is not a matter 
of simply earmarking resources to complete these projects. One 
of the biggest burdens we are currently confronting is that we 
spend nearly 20 years building highways. We transfer 1 billion 
[currency not specified] to one highway this year, and 2 billion 
the next year, and we spend 20 years doing the same thing over 
and over. If we exercise strict control over public 
expenditures, I believe we will begin to cut inflation. Most of 
all what we have to begin to control is the basic staples basket. 
  Dario, what are we currently confronting in the country? 
Most people are moonlighting because current wages are 
insufficient. They work by day and then go out at night to work 
for a couple more hours in order to make ends meet. That is why 
we plan to work very hard to defend the basic staple basket as 
well as to work on stopping inflation. Other countries have 
been able to do it, and I am sure we can do it in Colombia. 
  [Reporter] Dr. Pastrana, I would like to comment on 
something you just said with respect to an increase in 
investments in public projects and citizens safety [words 
indistinct] to the Armed Forces, public projects, the justice 
system, housing, education and industrial development. If all 
this increases, this is once again an increase in public 
spending. Priority status goes to the Armed Forces, public 
projects, the justice system, public safety, and housing. In 
this respect, it will be very difficult to undertake significant 
social investments and control spending at the same time because 
spending will be directed at addressing social issues. 
  [Pastrana] That depends, since one portion of spending is 
simply earmarked for government operation and not for public 
investments. This is why I believe it is important to cut 
government spending and to give priority to investments... 
  [Reporter, interrupting] [words indistinct] 
  [Pastrana] Not exactly. I believe that what we have to look 
for is how to eliminate nonessential spending. If we do not 
invest where we have to, then invite the private sector because 
I believe... [pauses]. I will give some concrete examples of 
public investment. 
  I plan to build at least 5,000 km of roads, of which 750 km 
will be highways -- what we know as four-lane highways -- 
between the interior and the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Whom 
do we plan to invite into these projects? The private sector. 
I also believe we must attract new revenues. We plan to invite 
the public sector to take part in road projects by way of a 
concession system. We also plan to pay for the new roads 
through a toll system. In the case I have just explained [words 
indistinct] improvements, building drainage systems. 
  We have received funds from the international banking 
system. 
There is nearly $110 million which would allow us to recover 
150,000 productive hectares for the country. Overall, I believe 
we must strive for two things: 1) to prioritize spending to 
carry out the projects the country demands; and 2) to work hand 
in hand with the private sector. This is already being done. 
For example, part of the Santa Fe de Bogota-Vallavicencio 
highway is being completed through a concession system, and the 
other part is being built by the government, and the toll system 
will be managed by the private sector. 
  I believe significant resources will be managed... [pauses] 
for example, in terms of Decree 100, there are significant 
resources that will allow the completion of projects through 
pension funds. We already see this happening in the case of 
Chile and other Latin American countries that have sought 
investment abroad. I believe this can be done in Colombia, and 
I know we will be able to do it. We need the government to 
invest in social projects, hospitals, and so on, but we also 
need to work hand in hand with the private sector. There are 
important projects to be undertaken in the country, and we need 
to promote investments in order to complete the programs I am 
proposing. 
  [Arizmendi] Dr. Pastrana, you have said that workers' 
salaries [words indistinct]. If it were possible, or if you had 
to make the decision by the end of this year to readjust the 
workers' salaries, would you base the increases on last year's 
rate of inflation or on the projections of the rate of inflation 
of your first year in power? 
  [Pastrana] Salaries must be real. What [word indistinct] 
would it do if Cesar Augusto [not further identified] were to 
say: The Norwegian coach earns $70,000 after inflation? What 
really concerns me is that to speak of salaries means having to 
speak of inflation. We have to make sure that salaries have 
true value. Salaries can very well increase by 18 percent, which 
is the rate of inflation. What can we do, however, if the 
government and private sector are increasing the rates of public 
services by 22 percent? Why not seek a agreement? 
  I think both the government and private enterprise must say: 
If we reach an agreement, the government must then control the 
rates of public services. The private sector must then say: We 
will try to reach an agreement on salaries; let us try to 
recover the true value of salaries. It is not a matter of 
simply saying: Let us increase the rate of inflation because the 
government is [word indistinct] inflation. This is not fair to 
the Colombian people. If we start at 18 percent, the price of 
gasoline will have increased 22 percent by 1 January. 
  I think it is important to work toward giving real value to 
these salaries, enabling this money to again have value. 
Suppose that by the end of this administration we manage to 
reduce inflation. Now then, what does this mean, to lower 
inflation? Sometimes people do not understand what this is all 
about. We must reduce the cost of the average family shopping 
basket in order to help the people understand. Sometimes we 
talk in terms used by economists, but we must look after the 
pocketbooks of Colombians. We must take care of their money. 
Let us hope Colombians will say gasoline increased 5 percent 
[words indistinct] that their salaries once again have real 
value. We must not just talk about decreasing inflation, and 
then, a few days later, undermine that possibility. 
  [Reporter] Let us talk about coffee, Dr. Pastrana. The way 
things are right now, it seems the next government -- a 
government which might be yours -- will have to manage a bonanza 
or a mini-bonanza. We Colombians seldom take full advantage of 
our windfalls. When there is a bonanza, we do not know what to 
do with it, or, for example, we fail to pay higher prices to the 
coffee growers. Today, it is being said that if coffee growers 
are paid better prices, this will lead to inflation. What will 
your government do with the coffee growers if you are elected 
president of the Republic? 
  [Pastrana] I was listening to a news report that said the 
foreign trade minister [words indistinct]. As of right now, I 
would suggest that before the end of his administration, 
President Gaviria should adjust coffee prices. I would do that 
right now. I leave that possibility open. I am proposing an 
increase in the price of coffee. 
  [Reporter] But you feel Gaviria that should do it to prevent 
you from having... 
  [Pastrana, interrupting] If Gaviria does not do it, my first 
government action will be to increase the domestic price of 
coffee. At this moment, I am proposing a 10-percent increase. 
Conditions are right, and the market has responded accordingly. 
Today, we are talking about economic and market laws, but these 
are not being applied to the coffee growers. As of right now, I 
propose a 10-percent increase to President Gaviria so we can 
have it before the end of his administration. Also, if 
President Gaviria does not implement the increase I am 
proposing, my first government action will be to hike prices 10 
percent so the domestic price of coffee will be about 145,000 
pesos. I would do that immediately, but I think the president 
should do this before the end of his term. 
  [Reporter] Wouldn't this hike increase inflation? 
  [Pastrana] Not at all, because we are only paying for... 
[pauses] We need to reactivate the coffee economy. We have not 
done this yet. The unemployment rates in the coffee sector are 
reaching... [pauses] the other day I heard these rates had 
reached 18-20 percent. Here, you can see that Colombia has 
become bogged down. We need to generate employment again. We 
need to increase coffee production. I am worried that Colombia 
sometimes is left with the idea that coffee production could 
decline next year to somewhere around 9.5-10 million bags. 
Today, we are producing between 10.5 million and 11 million 
bags. The country needs 14 million bags to enable it to start 
competing in the international market. Today, we do not have 
that opportunity. We must make investments in our efforts to 
combat the coffee stalk-borer. The most serious problem is that 
we have nearly 30,000 hectares... 
  [Reporter, interrupting] Thirty percent. 
  [Pastrana, interrupting] Yes, 30 percent of the plantations 
are affected by the stalk-borer. The state must make 
investments. Therefore, I think we have to look into this. I 
say that coffee once saved Colombia, and now Colombians must 
save the coffee growers. There are 350,000 households that 
depend on coffee for their livelihoods. We must generate 
employment. More than 40,000 jobs have been lost because of 
stalk-borer problems. Sometimes, I say: Let us not talk about 
just generating new jobs. Why not start by defending the jobs 
we have? Where does unemployment in Colombia come from? 
Unemployment comes mainly from not protecting the farming 
sector. How can we think we have lost 40,000 jobs in the last 
[words indistinct] in the coffee farms? First, let us start by 
defending the jobs we have. Let us give Colombian workers the 
chance to earn more, the chance to have better salaries. Let us 
protect the area in which we have lost most of the jobs. We 
must help the coffee growers. Today, the coffee fund is in good 
shape; it has the resources, and I think it is a good idea to 
pay the coffee growers a 10-percent increase as of today, right 
at this moment. 
  [Arizmendi] Dr. Pastrana, inasmuch as you told us you have 
another commitment... 
  [Reporter, interrupting] You will have a hard time making 
it. 
  [Arizmendi] I would like to invite you cordially to a debate 
on economic issues here on "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast 
with Dr. Ernesto Samper Pizano. 
  [Pastrana] On all of the issues? Why not talk about all of 
the issues? The country needs [words indistinct] political and 
social. We are ready for it, Dario, and we will be in touch. 
Perhaps, our campaign manager, Dr. Luis Alberto Morelo, will be 
able to... [pauses] and let us hope Dr. Humberto de la Calle 
will also be with us, together with Luis Hernando Ramirez. 
  [Arizmendi] Are you willing to go on television, also? 
  [Pastrana] Yes, we are willing. Naturally, this is now up to 
our advisers. We are willing to talk with them about all of the 
issues, and we will be able to explain things the way we have 
done today. We are willing to talk about economic and social 
issues, soccer, and all other kinds of issues. That is what the 
country is waiting for, and the country wants to hear our 
proposals. 
  [Arizmendi] Thank you very much for your visit. We also 
thank you, Dr. Luis Hernando Ramirez.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ernesto Samper, presidential </F>
candidate of the Liberal Party, by program host Dario Arizmendi 
in Santa Fe de Bogota; from "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast -- 
live] 
  [Text] [Arizmendi] Last night EL ESPECTADOR and the "CMI 
Newscast" released the results of a poll, the first on Colombian 
voters' intentions for the runoff election. You have an 
4-percent advantage; what does this tell you? 
  [Samper] I am very pleased with these results because they 
are the first figures to appear after Caracol's exit poll on 
election day. The poll clearly indicates the trend favors my 
candidacy for the runoff election; it also shows that the people 
who most likely voted for other candidates before have now 
decided to support my proposals. Obviously, then, I am very 
pleased with the results. 
  [Arizmendi] How should we interpret the statements you made 
yesterday? You said you would not accept any bureaucratic 
alliances with any minority group, with those who managed to 
secure minor percentages, including Antonio Navarro Wolff's 
movement, Miguel Maza Marquez' political group, and so on. 
  [Samper] The whole intent behind a runoff election was never 
to have the process following the first election become some 
sort of bureaucratic free-for-all to see who could offer more to 
this or that candidate to form an alliance. I have a clear 
program with a strong social content, as the public already 
knows. Whoever wants to vote for my government program, be they 
Liberal supporters or otherwise, is more than welcome to do so. 
  I am not willing to sit down to a bureaucratic negotiation 
or 
to accept anyone asking me how much I am willing to offer to 
secure the support of any candidate from the first election; 
instead, I believe we should be thinking in more broad terms in 
Colombia. Colombia needs the ideals of the majority working on 
the more significant issues of its future. That is where I 
stand, and those who would like to accompany me are welcome to 
do so, but not in exchange for any kind of bureaucratic offering. 
  [Arizmendi] Does that mean you have ruled out any kind of 
talks with Antonio Navarro or Miguel Maza Marquez? 
  [Samper] All types of negotiations are ruled out. I can 
converse with anyone now but I am not going to become involved 
in any bureaucratic negotiations or agreements in order to 
allocate pieces of the government beforehand in exchange for 
support. I have, essentially, a liberal candidacy and there are 
other independent sectors that have joined us. I hope many 
other independent sectors decide to support the proposals I have 
made for Colombia. I also hope others decide to leave the 
mistaken road of abstentionism and actively participate. With 
their support, I am sure, as the poll indicates today, I can win 
the runoff election. 
  [Arizmendi] What political changes will you make as a 
strategy to secure the support of the Liberal Party members 
around the country? 
  [Samper] Although the Liberal movement responded well in the 
election -- I have no major doubts about that -- the truth is 
not all Liberals were summoned and not all Liberals voted in 
many regions. 
  During this second phase of the campaign, I am going to 
concentrate more convincingly on reaffirming the Liberal nature 
of the message I have been presenting: equality, tolerance, and 
social justice. Second, I am going to try and convince the 
independent sectors that ours is the better alternative. 
  The country wants to take the social leap I have proposed. 
It wants the government to concentrate on health, education, 
and employment. This is why I am convinced my message must get 
to those Liberals who can still support my name. I call on them 
now and on all those independent sectors, no matter what party, 
that are looking for the right alternatives to support me. 
  [Arizmendi] What is your position on radio and television 
debates with presidential candidate Andres Pastrana Arango and 
between the vice presidential candidates? 
  [Samper] I am sending Pastrana a letter today inviting him 
to 
use the two hours of television time provided by law to hold two 
debates on issues of national interest. The campaign organizers 
would jointly select the topics. 
  I believe Colombians want to see what differences there are 
between Pastrana and myself. I am convinced I have an 
alternative for Pastrana's proposals. Pastrana represents a 
conservative and respectable candidacy, given the nature of the 
party supporting him. He has several economic proposals that 
differ from mine. I represent, however, a liberal option that 
enjoys the support of independent sectors. If we expect the 
public to choose on election day, then I believe they have the 
right to know from what they have to choose. They have the 
right to know what their options are. One word says it all: 
election, and we must choose one of several options. 
  [Arizmendi] Andres Pastrana Arango was here at the main 
studios of Caracol Network yesterday. He agreed to appear on 
this program, "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast, within the next 
few days for a debate with you on an open agenda. Would you 
accept this same invitation? 
  [Samper] Of course. I believe this stage of the campaign 
should be for Colombians to learn what makes each of us 
different from the other; that is why the Constitution 
establishes a runoff election. In that way, the people can vote 
on 19 June with a full knowledge of the two alternatives. 
  [Arizmendi] What does your security plan include exactly? 
You mentioned it yesterday outside an Immediate Attention 
Center in Bogota where there were a large number of citizens 
protesting against a gang of criminals who had spread fear 
throughout the capital. 
  [Samper] In addition to the country's problems with the 
guerrilla movements, there are also serious problems with the 
public security system, something which is true for Medellin and 
other cities as well as Santa fe de Bogota. Colombian cities 
have almost become the most unsafe in the world; this is why we 
have had a group of experts at campaign headquarters working on 
a civil protection bill for the past few months. That is what I 
presented in Santa Fe de Bogota yesterday, and I am on my way 
now to present it in Medellin. In essence, it states the 
following: 
  1. We have to increase the number of policemen on the force. 
Security will undoubtedly improve with more policemen; 
obviously, the police force must be more committed to the 
community and it must be a more moralized force. We must 
realize we cannot cover all of our cities with the current 
number of policemen. 
  2. We have to improve the communications network of the 
police force. A police force without a communication network is 
ineffective anywhere in the world; in addition, their 
communications network must extend even further to include other 
options. In Santa Fe de Bogota, for example, taxis have agreed 
to link their network with the police, making each cab a 
civilian patrol car. There are 10,000 taxi drivers with their 
eyes on the city. 
  3. We must create an elite police force to counter those 
crimes that hurt the community the most. Just as we have 
special forces for abductions and drug trafficking, we need a 
special force to fight rape, murder, and muggings. 
  4. The bill also proposes a restoral of penalties for 
certain activities. We propose penalizing actions that have 
nearly institutionalized juvenile delinquency. Given we can 
only arrest a juvenile for a crime involving more than 1 million 
pesos, these criminals have been vigilant in remaining below 
that ceiling, and they do as they please. We must restore the 
penalties for crimes such as these while including 
rehabilitation programs. 
  5. The proposed civil protection bill also provides for 
community involvement. If the community does not become 
involved in the problem, there is no way to effectively protect 
the cities. There are several new ways of organizing the 
community. 
  [Arizmendi] You said you are going to Medellin. The Liberal 
Party leaders, legislators, and political heads have issued a 
statement in which they ask you to reinstate the debate system 
in Antioquia Department to include acting senators, deputies, 
and council members; furthermore, they have asked that the 
Liberal Party's ideology and symbols be used more enterprisingly 
during this second phase of the campaign. What will your 
proposal or your response be to the Liberal Party's leaders in 
Antioquia Department? 
  [Samper] I am preparing that response now. I do believe we 
must make a more Liberal presentation of our message; after all, 
I am the candidate and a director of the Liberal Party, but I do 
not believe we should send that message out without any kind 
direction. We must make a commitment with Antioquia Department. 
  What are we going to do about insecurity in Medellin? How 
are we going to deal with unemployment in Medellin? They have 
one of the highest rates in the country. How can we provide 
Medellin and Antioquia Department in general with a modern 
infrastructure that will give them access to the Atlantic and 
Pacific Coasts? How will we go about completing the highway to 
Puerto Berrio? What plans do we have to save the education 
system in Antioquia Department? Antioquia Department was looked 
up to as a model for the country 10 years ago, and now they rank 
22d in the student aptitude testing program; thus, this is not a 
matter of telling the Liberals to vote for the Liberal Party 
but, rather, for a Liberal proposal for Antioquia Department 
instead. That is precisely what I will present in Medellin 
today.

  [Text] San Salvador, 31 May (ACAN-EFE) -- The Central 
American Integration System (SICA) will legally replace the 
Organization of Central America States (ODECA) after the 
"Succession Act" is signed by the nations in the area, 
represented by their ambassadors, in San Salvador today. 
According to official reports, the Central American ambassadors 
have taken the last legal step to allow the transfer of ODECA 
assets, rights, and holdings to SICA. 
  ODECA was created on 12 December 1962, according to a 
presidential agreement called the "San Salvador Charter." SICA 
was established, according to the 13 December 1991 "Tegucigalpa 
Protocol," to coordinate regional integration actions and 
institutions determined by heads of state in the region. 
  A SICA communique explains that according to a resolution 
issued at the 13th Central American summit, held in Panama on 11 
December 1992, the institution had to begin operations, based in 
San Salvador, on 1 February 1993, and later settle its legal 
position, which it is doing today. "SICA asserts itself as a 
far-reaching, modern, humanist organization which has already 
yielded results by guaranteeing the coordination of the 
integration process in the fields of the economic, social, 
cultural, and political development of the isthmus," the 
communique states.

<F P=106> [By Antonio Raluy] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 1 Jun (AFP) -- The more than 100 Cuban 
asylum seekers at the residence of the Belgian ambassador in 
Havana announced they rejected any contact with Cuban 
authorities and preferred "to set themselves on fire" at the 
diplomatic mission than renounce their objective of leaving the 
country. "Our well thought out decision is to set ourselves on 
fire here," the group of approximately 120 of asylum seekers 
stated. These persons, who made their way into the ambassador's 
residence on Saturday, made that statement in one of the four 
handwritten documents they managed to smuggle out of the 
diplomatic mission and deliver to the foreign media despite 
police surveillance. "It is better for us to die than to fall 
into their hands (...) We have nothing left to lose... Our 
country is a true hell on Earth," one of the documents affirmed. 
  When asked by the news media, Cuban official sources said 
they were not aware of the statements and reiterated that 
"entering an embassy is not the legal way to leave the country. 
Those who are at the Belgian Embassy must leave the building 
peacefully. Cuba is reiterating the guarantees given to Belgium 
that it will not take reprisals, and besides Cuba takes pride 
that it has not taken reprisals in previous cases." 
  Dated 29 May, or a day after the group entered the residence 
of Belgian Ambassador Paul Veirmeirsch, two statements are 
addressed to Pope John Paul II, the ambassadors stationed in 
Cuba, and human rights organizations. A third one is addressed 
to leaders of the Cuban exile community in the United States, 
Jorge Mas Canosa, head of the Cuban-American National 
Foundation, and U.S. Representatives from Florida Ileana 
Ros-Lehtinen and Lincoln Diaz-Balabart. 
  "We are not in a condition to begin talks or reach any 
agreement" with the Cuban authorities, one of the statements 
indicated. It added that the takeover of the residence "was a 
necessary demonstration of the desperate situation of Cubans, 
whose only options are to live indefinitely in chaos and poverty 
or risk their lives on rafts." 
  The second statement stressed the asylum seekers' 
determination. They describe themselves as peaceful opponents of 
the regime and human right defenders, of "staying here as long 
as it takes until our departure from Cuba with full guarantees 
is resolved by the Cuban Government in mutual accord with the 
government of any other country." 
  The most recent statement, dated Tuesday, reported to the 
foreign media the deterioration of the situation inside the 
diplomatic residence owing "to the constants acts of 
provocations" by the security forces. Among the complaints of 
"acts of provocations," the document mentioned Sunday's entrance 
into the residence "in a manner without explanation given the 
strong surveillance of the place," of our individuals, one of 
whom left on Monday. It also cited "threats" and demonstrations 
of force during the night in the area around the diplomatic 
mission that seek to "frighten the women and cause further 
trauma to the children." 
  This latest document noted that the asylum seekers created 
on 
30 May an organization called Union of Cubans for Liberty [Union 
de Cubanos por la Libertad], headed by one of the asylum 
seekers, Sergio Aguilar Cruz. 
  Meanwhile, one of the statements indicated there are 124 
asylum seekers in the embassy (68 men, 32 women, and 24 
children). Others put that figure at 119. Until now, the 
Belgian authorities have reported that 114 persons, including 24 
children, entered the residence on Saturday.

  [Text] A call for an immediate cessation of hostilities and 
for preservation of the national unity of Yemen are among the 
most significant issues contained in the draft resolution of the 
11th Ministerial Summit of the Nonaligned Movement. On 31 May, 
experts began to work on the resolution, which will be presented 
for final approval on 3 June. 
  Meanwhile, the heads of the delegations are meeting behind 
closed doors in what the organizers are calling a brainstorm, 
which will last into the night. In the morning, Robaina is 
expected to give an address on the democratization of 
international relations. Since the beginning of the summit, 
numerous delegations have defended the need for radical 
transformation of the UN Security Council and increased openness 
in its proceedings+. 
  In an address before the plenum on 31 May, Robaina issued a 
call to thwart efforts to turn the United Nations into an 
intervention tool against underdeveloped nations. Robaina has 
also conducted an intensive exchange of opinions with foreign 
ministers from diverse countries. Robaina will meet today with 
representatives from Kenya, Belize, South Africa, Palestine, 
Algeria, and Qatar.

  [Text] Managers throughout the Caribbean charged with the 
responsibility of developing programs aimed at reducing the 
spread of the deadly AIDS [Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome] 
pandemic are meeting in Antigua this week. The purpose of the 
meeting is to formulate more effective ways of managing AIDS 
programs in the respective countries. The national AIDS program 
meeting got off to an official start yesterday. As we hear in 
this dispatch from Debbie Francis, the meeting was declared open 
by Antigua's Health Minister Hilroy Humphreys. 
  [Begin recording] [Francis] Health Minister Hilroy Humphreys 
has underscored the need for continued educational programs 
about the killer disease, AIDS. He says there is still a large 
number of persons who need to be sensitized on how the HIV virus 
is transmitted. Mr. Humphreys also revealed the number of AIDS 
cases, which are reported up to the 15th of May: 
  [Humphreys] Enormous strides have been made in our knowledge 
of the infection. This knowledge seems not to be reaching the 
most vulnerable groups in our society. The rate of infection 
continues unabated. I understand that the most recent estimated 
rate of HIV is 5,000 per day. Here in Antigua, up to the 15th of 
May, we have 97 cases. I may be so presumptuous to multiply that 
by four because we are talking about husbands, we are talking 
about wives, we are talking about [words indistinct], we are 
talking about deputies -- and the Caribbean people know what I 
am talking about. That is indeed very serious. 
  [Francis] AIDS program monitor (Felicity Aima) outlined the 
main purpose of the management course. 
  [(Aima)] The purpose of the course is to improve the 
management of national AIDS programs through a process of 
increasing knowledge and developing skills necessary for 
management of national AIDS programs. It is designed for policy 
and decision makers concerned or associated with education and 
planning, health education, prevention and health care, and 
persons with primary responsibility for coordinating and 
implementing national AIDS programs. 
  [Francis] Meanwhile, a representative of the Global Program 
on AIDS in Geneva also spoke after the function. 
  [Geneva representative] The Global Program on AIDS has three 
major tasks: Its task is to reduce HIV transmission; try to 
reduce the personal and social impact of HIV; and its third, and 
possibly most important, task now is to mobilize global 
resources in response to HIV AIDS. To this end, the Global 
Program on AIDS has been recently reorganized to render it more 
effective. 
  [Francis] Also addressing the opening session was the 
coordinator of AIDS and [words indistinct] program in 
Washington, Dr. Fernando Zacharia, and the chief medical 
officer, Dr. Carlos Mulroon. I'm Debbie Francis reporting. [end

special guests; ladies and gentlemen: 
  We have the high honor of assuming today the presidency of 
the Republic by the sovereign will of the Salvadoran people 
freely expressed through votes and abiding by the Constitution 
of the Republic. In the first place, we thank God Almighty for 
this privilege of serving our beloved people. We accept this 
challenge with humility and ask God to enlighten us in every one 
of our actions. We know there is no privilege without 
responsibility, and for that reason we accept our responsibility 
with full awareness of the historic moment for the nation and 
the world. 
  In a very special manner, we want to voice our most sincere 
gratitude to the noble Salvadoran people, assuring them that we 
will work for them, day after day, throughout our entire 
administration. We will not forget for a single minute the 
principle that public power comes from the people and that 
government officials are their delegates with the powers granted 
by the law. With pure patriotic fervor, we express our deepest 
appreciation to all the men, women, and youth who form part of 
the Nationalist Republican Alliance, ARENA. [applause, cheers] 
  Five years ago you forged the way toward national recovery, 
and you are today propelling us toward the overall 
reconstruction of the country, making it possible for us to 
experience this historic moment. Once again you told El 
Salvador you are here for the fatherland, a fatherland that 
joins all of us [applause] in constructing a future in which 
there can be coexistence and in which peace, progress, and 
liberty can be shared. [applause] 
  We wish to make special recognition of President Alfredo 
Cristiani, [applause] artisan [applause] of peace. His 
administration will go into the pages of our history, and 
current and future generations will reap the benefits of his 
extraordinary work as president. I am receiving today the 
presidential sash, which I must hand over five years from now on 
a day much like today, as the symbol that the work accomplished 
is just a relay to continue onward in building the future of the 
nation. 
  We are grateful for the presence of representatives of 
friendly peoples and governments. We regard it as a new 
expression of support for the people of El Salvador in this 
process of peace and strengthening of democracy to which we are 
so fervently committed. We are building a new El Salvador, which 
is modern, democratic, and participative. This demands 
legality, security, honesty, respect for each other, solidarity, 
and opening. The framework for our administration will be the 
Constitution and the laws, which we, the government and the 
governed, must all respect. Our objective is the full state of 
law that will guarantee the equality of all Salvadorans before 
the law, making sure that this will be the golden rule of 
national coexistence, without improper privileges or unjust 
exclusions. 
  We will work tirelessly to achieve the conditions that will 
ensure the highest level possible of safety for the people, 
within the framework of the law and full respect for the rights 
of individuals. We will combat crime, drug trafficking, 
kidnapping, extortion, and violence with total commitment. In 
this respect, we will [applause] In this respect [repeats 
himself] we will give top priority to developing public security 
as the guarantor of internal peace and the tranquillity of 
citizens. 
  Our administration will not tolerate corruption of any kind. 
We will make sure public functions are honest and integrity 
exists in all public servants so that honesty in every one of 
our actions becomes the norm that guides the work of the 
administration as a whole. We believe in the irresistible 
force of example. That is why, before the entire nation, we 
pledge to have an administration that is honest and respectful 
of public affairs so that democracy can continue gaining 
credibility. [applause] 
  We will work toward strengthening a society that lives in 
harmony and where respect for human dignity is the basic rule of 
coexistence among Salvadorans. We do not want any more 
confrontation, much less polarization. We will work for 
cooperation among all the political and social forces to advance 
the important national project. 
  To us, it is very clear that this society should work as a 
one; however, its social integration is not a beautiful [word 
indistinct]. It is also a challenge to improve, directly linked 
to the living conditions of human beings. In terms of 
Salvadoran solidarity integration, we will work unceasingly to 
improve the standard of living, particularly for the most needy 
so that no Salvadoran falls by the wayside on the important road 
to development. 
  We consider fundamental initiating broad development of all 
the currents of thinking, of ideas. If ideas are not challenged 
they do not develop, thereby preventing the possibilities of 
finding the best options in the search of solutions to problems. 
  The time of dogmas and fanatics has ended. Historical 
rationality prevails as a prerequisite of reality. Our country 
is an example of this spirit, and we will do everything possible 
for it to continue on this road. These principles are 
fundamental to generating trust. This is a vital condition for 
governing and leading the nation on the road to progress. A 
nation without faith in itself, its government, and its future, 
is prone to go under at any time. 
  We are faced with enormous challenges in the reconstruction 
of our nation. The greatest effort should originate from 
ourselves. As a nation we are grateful for the support we 
received during the conflict and during the period of 
fulfillment of the peace agreements. We ask the international 
community to continue with the cooperation to totally 
reconstruct this nation and to consolidate peace that serves as 
an example for the world. [applause] 
  To our Central American brothers, we send you our most 
sincere greetings. The significant political changes the world 
has experienced in the past years and the economic globalization 
process demonstrate to us the indisputable need to continue 
working arduously as a region to integrate [word indistinct] and 
find together favorable positions when facing third nations. 
During the last years, thanks to the regional presidents' work 
and dedication we have obtained significant progress toward 
Central American integration. Nevertheless, we also recognize 
there is still a long road ahead. Therefore, from here on we 
promise to work with our counterparts, with our best resolve and 
energy, within the framework of respect and sovereignty, to 
contribute to the progress of our peoples. 
  Our administration's clear goal will be to achieve social 
peace. For this we must turn El Salvador into a nation of 
opportunities, with social [word indistinct]. [applause] The 
lack of opportunity to progress causes poverty and frustration. 
We have just come out of a conflict that to a great extent was 
the result of despair over the lack of opportunities. A large 
number of our compatriots live in poverty. We must break the 
vicious circle of he who is born poor must die poor. [applause] 
We will give special attention to education, health, child 
protection, and the environment. We must work toward solving 
these big problems through the participation of all Salvadorans. 
We will foster support programs for human promotion to improve 
the standard of living. We will put our efforts in the people 
to achieve human, social, economic, and political development, 
so that this can be a truly sustained development. 
  This demands a different attitude, a different frame of 
mind, and a different focus that will allow us to move onto the 
path of modernization and which, in turn, will allow us to cope 
firmly with the challenges of the new millennium. We must 
stress the best characteristics all Salvadorans have -- our 
creativity and hard-working nature -- because this is our 
greatest resource. We have attained peace, and now the guns are 
silent. Nevertheless, we must still do away with senseless 
rivalries and antagonism. We must rebuild our nation in a 
physical, moral, and spiritual manner in order that, together, 
we can achieve a social peace that will be a new means of 
attaining harmony, respect, security, and participation among 
all Salvadorans. [applause] 
  Social peace must be born in our homes, taught in our 
schools, and improved in the workplace. This is the best legacy 
we can leave to our children, who are the future for which we 
are working today. We will prepare our youth to enable them to 
face the challenges of the future, guide them along a productive 
path in all branches of human knowledge, and work hard in order 
that Salvadoran youths be able to live, study, and work in a 
dignified and happy manner. 
  Our government will promote reforms that will lead to 
obtaining the greatest possible degree of efficiency in our 
work. Now that all currents of political thought are gradually 
uniting over the social market economy, efficient government 
will mark the basic difference in our ability to satisfy the 
hopes of the people and to maintain their support. 
  Therefore, we are going to carry out a thorough reform 
program in the public sector that will satisfy the demands of a 
free, participative, and unified society that will promote the 
most efficient use of resources and will improve the quality of 
services. During this process, we will seek adequate means to 
decentralize and stimulate the private sector's participation in 
government services in an orderly and gradual manner, as well as 
in accordance with the capabilities of local governments and the 
private sector. 
  We are going to help strengthen the municipalities to enable 
them to assume the responsibilities that result from the 
decentralization of public services and that will heighten their 
sensitivity to the needs of their citizens. In this way, we 
will seek mechanisms that will allow greater participation of 
the communities so that they can become key players in resolving 
their problems and promoting their own development. In this 
way, we will be respecting their dignity and putting an end to 
the state paternalism that has inhibited the initiative of the 
people. 
  In our government work, we will try to strengthen the 
democratic model to create a solid foundation that will lead us 
to stable and lasting social harmony. Now that all political 
beliefs have room and freedom in our society to express 
themselves, we must defend ideological pluralism in the face of 
systematic confrontation, authoritarian impositions, arrogance, 
and political violence. All political parties, social 
organizations... [applause; Calderon Sol repeats himself] all 
political parties, social organizations, and the government must 
maintain an open and sincere dialogue to reject and eradicate, 
as much as possible, those practices that generate excessive 
passion, hatred, and violence, all of which undermine democracy 
and take away freedom from the individual. [applause] 
  All political groups are present in the Legislative 
Assembly. 
As president, our work requires sweeping dialogue and support 
to carry out the government plan. We want to tell the 
opposition that we are going to maintain open channels of 
communication with the assembly to listen to its opinions and to 
reach a basic consensus. We hope to have a constructive 
opposition so that, together, we will find the best options for 
our people. [applause] 
  In a similar manner, we will work with various civil 
organizations to attain alliances in terms of our government 
plan and to find solutions to specific problems. Dialogue, 
sincere communication, and the fulfilling of commitments are 
basic requirements for generating confidence, progressing with 
determination, and governing in a way that reflects the hope of 
the people. 
  I would like to speak of an institution that, as an 
integral part of society, has already begun a process of 
renovation to accommodate itself within the new peace process: 
our Armed Forces. [applause] Our Armed Forces have a clear 
mission and full knowledge of the role they must play within the 
Republic's renovated institutional picture. It is with great 
pleasure that its commander greets the military institution, in 
general, and wishes it a promising future [applause] while 
fulfilling its patriotic duties within the Constitution's 
framework. 
  We wish to reiterate to all Salvadorans and the 
international 
community that is amply represented on this occasion our 
decision to comply properly with the peace accords, because they 
represent the commitment [applause] not of a government or a 
sector, but of the whole nation. We cannot ignore that this is 
a necessary condition on the path of no return that will lead us 
to constructing social peace. [applause] 
  Concerning justice, deep changes are necessary as well as a 
determination to carry them out. The Presidency is ready to do 
what it must do, and it will cooperate with the other state 
organizations in doing what they must do to ensure that our 
judicial system meets the requirements of a modern and 
democratic society. In doing so, we must strengthen judicial 
order. We must see to it that everyone abides by the law and 
that no one is above the law. [applause] 
  We cannot speak of justice if we do not have public order, 
and we cannot speak of public order if we do not have a police 
corps that is properly trained, equipped, and deployed 
throughout the country. Our commitment is to make the National 
Civilian Police [PNC] an institution that will give true and 
ample protection to the people, a PNC that will strictly abide 
by the law, a PNC that will make us proud. [applause] 
  I must state that we will encourage a full respect for human 
rights and absolute freedom for Salvadorans. In schools and 
through the media we will encourage the teaching of peace and a 
respect for these fundamental rights so that these principles 
will become part of our most cherished beliefs. We believe it 
is a state's duty to create conditions that will foster equal 
opportunities to all so that everyone can achieve better 
standards of living. We will tackle poverty by promoting plans 
of human development and by giving productive work to those who 
have nothing, thus giving them the opportunity to attain a true 
wellbeing. 
  Ours is not, however, a short term vision. The real 
solutions aimed at eradicating poverty from its root are long 
term. It will take much more than one presidential term to do 
this; therefore, we commit ourselves to work, from day one, to 
create the basis for an overall permanent development. We will 
stress sectorial policies and investment in the people to 
undertake the path that will lead to human development. 
Education and health are the two main factors to increase human 
potential; education and health are also the best tool for man's 
advancement, for the advancement of his families, and for the 
advancement of the country. 
  The coverage and quality of education are major factors. We 
must encourage research and technological development in order 
to compete in the world, which is increasingly becoming more 
globalized each day. We cannot stand on the sidelines of 
progress. We are going to promote a profound reform in 
education by earmarking greater resources, improving educational 
programs, and training teachers, to whom we convey our respect 
and admiration. Our goal as a country must be to reduce 
illiteracy to a minimum and bring quality education to the most 
remote area of our territory. 
  The men and women of this nation are our greatest resource, 
and educating them is to invest in the future. [applause] 
Higher education and technical institutions are facing a major 
challenge; that is, to grow in step with the demands of the new 
El Salvador we are building. If these institutions would truly 
like to contribute effectively to the country's overall 
development, they must compete for excellence, upgrade their 
programs and the quality of their education, expand their 
potential for research, and explore new ideas to reaffirm 
individuals' liberty and creative capability. 
  Health services also directly increase human potential and 
encourage the development of individuals. Although we have made 
progress in past years, the health system is still inadequate to 
meet the demand, thus creating frustration among the people. In 
this field we will also implement a profound reform by promoting 
methods that demonstrate they can solve health problems. As the 
government, we will work to solve these problems by emphasizing 
preventive care, seeking ways to decentralize services, and 
achieving greater participation by the private sector and the 
communities. 
  When we talk of overall health, we are also talking of the 
environment, because most illnesses afflicting our country's 
neediest are caused by the pollution of the earth, riverbeds, 
and the air, as well as by the deterioration of the environment. 
If we do not protect our resources, we are betraying future 
generations, dooming them to a world of desolation due to our 
indifference and ineptness. Our government will play an active 
role, because the state has to ensure, as part of its 
(?complementary) duties, the protection of the environment by 
legislating, educating, and encouraging the implementation of 
adequate projects; therefore, we are going to generate policies 
that succeed in making growth and the environment complementary, 
because there can be no sustainable development if that is 
achieved at the expense of the environment and the extinction of 
our natural resources. [applause] 
  There can be no overall social progress either if we do not 
meet the demand for decent housing, a large-scale problem the 
solving of which requires unbelievable amounts of resources and 
time. In past years, we have had encouraging progress in this 
field. We must be more daring, however, and find new ways to 
solve housing problems so that El Salvador can become a country 
of homeowners. 
  Reforming the social security system, which is inefficient 
and does not provide sufficient coverage, is fundamental. We 
must improve the current system, which excludes almost 80 
percent of the economically active population from protection. 
  We will promote new options to expand coverage of Social 
Security, encouraging the participation of the private sector. 
We want to prevent the anguish with which most of our workers 
view their elderly years, because they are condemned to be a 
burden for their families after having spent their lives working 
for the country's progress. [applause] 
  Special attention must be given to youths and sports, 
because 
our low-income youths are exposed to high-risk social 
situations, and only by giving them spiritual guidance, moral 
education, training, and healthy recreation will we have 
sports-minded and studious youths. Along with cultural 
programs, these things will bring about the overall education of 
the young people of El Salvador. [applause] 
  Our social agenda is directed in one way or another at 
protecting the Salvadoran family, because that is where the most 
beautiful lessons in life are learned. Those lessons are a love 
of God, country, and fellow man. [applause] 
  Many women today are responsible for their homes. They play 
the double role of mother and father, and their families live 
under difficult circumstances. For them, we will create 
programs that will enable them to improve their standard of 
living. We will also provide special protection to women, 
children, and the elderly. [applause] 
  During the administration which has just concluded, great 
economic reforms were carried out, and noticeable progress was 
achieved, permitting significant growth in recent years. Our 
challenge now is to maintain high rates of growth and to turn 
them into economic growth with equality. To this end, our 
policy will seek to maintain conditions that will ensure 
stability to consolidate the confidence of the private 
productive sector, which is the generator of wealth, the primary 
agent of modernization, and the promoter of progress. [applause] 
  Concurrently, we are going to strengthen free market 
competition, in which the state must act as a mediator to 
prevent abuses. In this field, the elimination of the 
imbalances that still exist will be necessary in order to 
provide protection to both producers and consumers. We clearly 
speak of freedom, not of free license, much less of any kind of 
privileges. [applause] 
  Economic progress must be based on the efficiency of 
competition, but without losing sight of the fact the economy 
must play a social function, because the reason for its 
existence is not the accumulation of wealth but, rather, the 
generation of wealth to improve the quality of life and the 
standard of living of all citizens. [applause] In other words, 
it must be the vehicle to achieve the common good. 
  Within the social market system, we are going to stimulate 
domestic savings and encourage private investment, both national 
and foreign; in this way, we want to expand the productive 
borders and the sources that generate resources and permanent 
jobs, because that is where the opportunities for individual and 
national progress are found. 
  One cannot speak of greater private investment, however, if 
the public sector does not contribute to progress; that is why a 
thorough reform must urgently be undertaken to achieve 
efficiency in this sector and, as much as possible, to eliminate 
the fiscal deficit, the primary source of inflation. 
  We must be aware that the telecommunications, electricity, 
water, and state infrastructure services are inefficient. They 
represent a financial burden for the public sector, and they 
restrict growth. As a result, we must urgently establish the 
conditions for the private sector to play a more prominent role. 
Therefore, we will begin a privatization process in many public 
services. [applause] 
  Workers must actively participate in this process and be 
shareholders of these enterprises. They face the challenge of 
becoming workers and investors where their capability and 
experience contribute to progress, allowing them to directly 
benefit. If we talk of development with equity, with programs 
to reduce poverty, we must then regard economic growth and 
private investment as the primary source in generating jobs. 
This is fundamental, because employment gives dignity to 
individuals, allowing them to advance by the fruit of their own 
effort. 
  This is not sufficient, however. We must also seek a true 
increase in workers' income, something that cannot be done by 
decree. We must train them and seek the technologies to raise 
labor productivity. Only in this way will we avoid inflationary 
pressures that diminish the value of wage increases. We 
understand that a harmonious relationship between workers and 
businessmen is necessary, because they comprise an inseparable 
nucleus that generates benefits for the country. 
  The informal sector of the economy and small-scale 
businesses 
generate most jobs. Under our government, training programs 
aimed at these sectors will be especially important, as will be 
the funneling of loans in market conditions. We will promote a 
joint effort aimed at upgrading the capability to produce and 
the efficiency of these sectors so that their goods and services 
will improve the quality of their products, and, therefore, 
their revenues. 
  Likewise, all sectors of the economy face the challenge of 
modernization and constant technological changes if they want to 
stay in the market. Though meeting internal demands must be an 
important objective, conquering new international markets must 
become the goal of every Salvadoran businessman, given it is 
there where the opportunities to expand our commercial borders 
as a country lie. 
  Agriculture is one sector that demands attention. We are 
committed to encouraging productive changes, stimulating 
technological progress and training, as well as guaranteeing the 
right to property and personal security in the countryside. 
[applause] 
  We shall create special programs to encourage personal and 
family progress for peasants within the agrarian reform program 
[sector reformado]. We are going to jointly establish 
conditions that free them from any sort of political 
manipulation so that they can play an active role in their own 
development and ensure that they can acquire property when they 
wish. 
  During El Salvador's new era, tourism will play an important 
role, because it generates resources and jobs. We must prepare 
ourselves to offer the best of our natural resources as well as 
the personal warmth that characterizes us. We believe we speak 
for all Salvadorans when we say our goal as a society is to 
attain social and economic development; nevertheless, it must be 
realized this demands great amounts of resources, investments in 
both human resources and the infrastructure. These resources 
should be supplied mainly by us, Salvadorans, meaning we must 
all contribute to the country by paying our taxes. [applause] 
We are going to fight decidedly against the culture of tax 
evasion and fraud until one day we can say with satisfaction: I 
can demand, because I pay my taxes. I can demand, because I am 
a tax contributor. [applause] I can demand, because I 
contribute to making my country big and prosperous. 
  As this new government takes office, we reaffirm we have 
only one commitment with El Salvador and its people: to build a 
better future. We do not want to create false hopes, because 
there are no miracles along the road to progress. There is 
serious and coordinated work, however, that must be carried out 
with dedication and as a team trying to interpret the people's 
true feelings and aspirations. 
  Our objective is to execute our government plan and fulfill 
the promises we made during the campaign. We will do so with 
everyone's support and by joining our efforts and volition. Our 
challenge is to build a better country for all, with equal 
opportunity for each of us to progress according to our effort 
and will to succeed. With every action we must bear in mind 
that the solution to our problems must arise from our own 
efforts as a community and as a nation, overcoming any 
temptation of state paternalism and ensuring respect from the 
international community. 
  My fellow countrymen, our country is beginning today a new 
phase in the transition toward a consolidated democracy, for 
which our country has been working since 1982. We realize the 
new government, being the first presidential inauguration of the 
postwar era, brings high hopes and opens new horizons for 
national development. We must say we are fully aware we are not 
here just to do a job but to accomplish a mission. It is a 
moral job, a job with political content and historical 
responsibility. This job, in essence, calls for hard work and 
requires a degree of effectiveness that will allow the people to 
see the benefits of democracy in their day to day life, not only 
on the political level but on social, economic, and cultural 
levels as well. [applause] 
  We promise the nation and the world we will not fail in this 
vital task, as the future depends on our success. Our 
administration will be the last historic step toward the new 
century; thus, it symbolizes the challenge we now face in favor 
of peace, democracy, and development. We have come to the 
Presidency to continue the promotion of an ongoing process, but 
we are well aware our true task will be to demand a large dose 
of creativity and imagination, capability, and sensibility. We 
will not shy away from this challenge, because we are sure we 
will have the people's understanding and support. They will be 
the comptroller and judge of our actions. 
  In order to succeed in this truly patriotic endeavor, we 
invoke the grace and inspiration of our Lord, the Savior of the 
world, that He might enlighten our decisions and provide the 
strength and wisdom to bring them to life for the good of our 
nation and each and every Salvadoran. May the Lord guide us to 
work together to make a new El Salvador, as that is the only way 
we will live a better life.

  [Text] Brasilia -- President Itamar Franco has broken an 
agreement signed earlier with the ruralist bloc in Congress to 
secure approval of the economic plan. He has done this by 
vetoing a paragraph of a law providing that the same index be 
applied to adjust agricultural loans and agricultural minimum 
prices. 
  The presidential veto, which has upset the ruralist leaders 
in Congress, affects Paragraph Two of Article 16 of the Real 
Value Unit [URV] Conversion Law. 
  Deputy Nelson Marquezelli (PTB-SP) [Brazilian Labor 
Party-Sao 
Paulo], chairman of the Agriculture Committee at the Chamber of 
Deputies, said: "We found out that Bacha is the one giving 
orders within the government." 
  Marquezelli was thus referring to Finance Ministry special 
adviser Edmar Bacha, who had negotiated with the ruralist bloc 
members and who had resisted until the last minute the changes 
proposed by the lawmakers. 
  The ruralist bloc consists of nearly 130 congressmen of 
various parties who normally vote as a bloc on matters of 
interest to their sector. 
  The ruralists demanded that the same index be applied to 
adjust both agricultural minimum prices and loans in order to 
stop them from blocking the approval of the government's 
economic plan. 
  Marquezelli said the rural bloc will mobilize to override 
the 
presidential veto. 
  Marquezelli added: "The government is represented by its 
leader, but it does not honor the commitments he makes." Luiz 
Carlos Santos (PMDB-SP) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Sao 
Paulo], the government's leader in the Chamber of Deputies, was 
responsible for striking a deal with the ruralists. FOLHA 
yesterday unsuccessfully tried to find Santos to hear his 
comments. 
  Marquezelli wants to have the veto overridden already in 
June. He said he will seek to mobilize congressional leaders 
beginning next week. 
  In light of the president's decision, the law goes into 
effect but the vetoed articles are returned to Congress to be 
discussed by the legislature. They will be included in the 
"list of vetoes." 
  An absolute majority of the Chamber of Deputies (252 votes) 
and of the Senate (41 votes) -- in a joint session -- is 
required to override a presidential veto. 
  Based on a justification of the veto drafted by the Finance 
Ministry, the government contends that the wording of the law 
violates "a precedent set by the Federal Supreme Court that 
rejects any breach of contract."

<F P=106> [Report: "Stability and Confidence" by President Itamar </F>
Franco] 
  [Text] Brasilia, 31 May (AE) -- We are not far off from 
creating a strong, stable, and new currency as a result of an 
economic stabilization plan characterized by its scope and its 
democratic nature because it involves Congress and society as a 
whole in its formulation and its careful and gradual 
implementation. 
  Inflation, which in the past was used by successive 
Brazilian 
Governments as an instrument for development, has surpassed any 
type of control that can be applied and has turned into the main 
factor strangling our economy, thus seriously and adversely 
affecting productive investment and, consequently, the 
generation of jobs. At the same time, inflation feeds financial 
speculation that in turn generates unproductive profits and 
concentrates, in an intolerable way, income, thus demoralizing 
the traditional values of work, savings, planning for the 
future, and social solidarity. 
  Today we are clearly aware that chronic inflation is the 
major obstacle the country has to fight in order to return to 
sustained growth and to correct the immense social distortions 
we are suffering. We also are fully aware that inflation 
seriously and inhumanely affects the poorest, the salary 
earners, and those who have no protection against price runs and 
the erosion of salaries. The results of years of chronic 
inflation can be seen in the low efficiency of the state, in its 
incapability of furnishing basic services, investing in 
infrastructure, and helping to improve the country's social 
indicators, especially in education, health, sanitation, and 
housing. 
  Past governments tried shock treatments with measures that 
surprised the people and even included the temporary 
confiscation of savings. This shock treatment generated the 
passing impression that inflation was under control, but in the 
end it accelerated inflation even more, provoking new 
distortions and a lack of confidence. Those plans contained 
several fundamental factors for stability such as balancing the 
budget and the adjusting of the country's external debts that 
were not implemented, thus thwarting the illusory results that 
were obtained. 
  We now are going to try a new and gradual formula, without 
apprehension, without surprises. In the first place have 
created the conditions to reach a fiscal balance. We then 
implemented a formula to free the economy from indexation and at 
the same time we re-established the comparability of prices; we 
have created a single index that is being applied to all prices 
-- rates, goods, and fiscal services. And it will not be until 
July that we will issue the new currency, the real, which will 
replace the cruzeiro real, and it will generate more rigorous 
rules pertaining to monetary and exchange policies and to 
guaranteeing stability. 
  The plan's gradualism will allow us to help its evolution by 
making the necessary corrections and in helping the population 
and economic agents adapt to the prospects of an economy with a 
low inflation rate, in which production is given incentives, 
salaries maintain their purchasing power, and with stable 
prices. We are close to making the decisive step with the 
creation of the new currency. Thus this government can pass on 
to its successor, no matter whom, a country with a stabilized 
economy. We also are prepared to implement some structural 
reforms in order to guarantee this stability in the long term 
and to ensure that the sustained economic growth is socially 
efficient. 
  Thus, Brazil will consolidate as a great nation and as an 
important international interlocutor. It is in our hands to 
make this hope a long-term reality as of 1 July.

  [Text] What alliances can be formed in the next Congress 
that will open on 10 August 1994? This seems to be the question 
the political parties that will be represented in Congress are 
already asking themselves. A question that, for the moment, has 
no answer. For some, the question involves electoral 
calculations for 1996, and for others, only a question of 
presence or leadership within Congress. Thus, each group has its 
own expectations. Some are interested in the presidency of the 
Congress, while others probably are not. 
  There exists a partisan thesis according to which the forces 
of the center left and the left join together for the purpose of 
isolating the Social Christians and the government parties. The 
MPD [Democratic Peoples Movement], the ID [Democratic Left], DP 
[Popular Democratic Party], PRE [Ecuadoran Roldosist Party], 
Ecuadoran Revolutionary Popular Action, CFP [Concentration of 
Popular Forces], Alfarist Radical Front, National Liberation 
Party, and the Socialist Party of Ecuador could join together, 
leaving aside the Social Christians and the government, so that 
the former will be "burned" by their association with the 
latter. Supporters of this thesis appear to be primarily certain 
leaders of ID and DP. This strategy, however, seems not to 
appeal to many, especially the people of the MPD. 
  Yesterday, Juan Jose Castello, leader of the now powerful 
MPD 
bloc, said he did not view an alliance with the DP as having 
great possibilities "due to the rightward leaning position 
adopted recently by the president of that party, Osvaldo 
Hurtado. If they want a congressional accord, they will have to 
change their positions" said Castello, who seemed yesterday 
rather contrary to entering any alliance. 
  For its part, the Social Christian Party (PSC) seems to be 
interested in forming an opposition bloc that would exclude the 
government and the center-left parties. The idea is to 
stigmatize the center-left parties as parties of the government. 
This is more or less the same tactic; everyone wants to place 
their rivals next to the discredited government. 
  For that reason, Jaime Nebot's party seems interested in 
seeking an alliance with the MPD, CFP, PRE, and the 
independents, placing Fernando Larrea in the Presidency of 
Congress. The PSC believes it is of no advantage to occupy the 
Presidency of Congress because it always imparts to the occupant 
the "repellant" odor of governmentalism. 
  This possibility, however, does not seem very likely either 
because of the intransigent position of the MPD, which would 
become the "starlet" of Congress. Castello was very clear 
yesterday when he said he did not rule out the possibility of an 
arrangement with the Social Christians, "if and when they 
renounce their interest in privatization." That is the 
touchstone: privatization would align the Social Christians with 
the government, or it will not pass. The Social Christians are 
faced with a dilemma: either they support privatization in which 
they believe, and they appear to be allies of the government, or 
they take a position contrary to privatization, just to lend 
credibility to their opposition. 
  An MPD-PSC pact would appear to be asking the impossible, 
but 
nothing can be ruled out in politics. MPD voters, however, 
surely would not like to see their deputies reach an agreement 
with the greatest defenders of privatization. 
  There are also those who hope to form an opposition 
coalition 
called the "dignity" bloc. The idea, conceived by deputy-elect 
Frank Vargas, is that all of the left and left-center parties 
that have not been in government form a coalition, even knowing 
that they will not constitute a majority. 
  HOY has learned that Vargas wants to have talks with the 
leaders of the MPD, the Socialists, National Liberation, CFP, 
and other parties that have never been in power. 
  This possibility, however, also seems remote because it will 
be difficult to find deputies willing to enter the congressional 
fray, knowing that they will not be in the majority, which is 
the only way they can enter legislative commissions. What could 
be called macropolitics -- that which is designed to find an 
alternative to presidential power -- is faced with 
micropolitics, plagued by immediate interests, and which 
contemplates the possibility of present power. "A bird in the 
hand is worth two in the bush," several possible Vargas allies 
must be thinking, before supporting the remote and still 
uncertain chances of the general [Vargas]. 
  These are all possibilities that are bandied about, ideas 
that circulate, but as yet there is nothing definite. A few more 
days will decide. For now, all that is certain is that no one 
wants to be the government's allies.

  [Text] The Foreign Ministry has sent us a note to clarify a 
diplomatic incongruity emphasized in our "Political Lobby" 
column on our country's policy on Cuba and Haiti. The Foreign 
Ministry Information and Culture Department explained that the 
two countries involve different situations. 
  Concerning Haiti's case, the Foreign Ministry indicated that 
a UN resolution on a blockade against Haiti was complied with. 
In other words, Chile, as a UN member, had to comply with this 
resolution. 
  Concerning Cuba, the Foreign Ministry pointed out that the 
United States alone has imposed a unilateral embargo, which has 
not been confirmed by the United Nations. Concerning its trade 
relations with the Caribbean nation, Chile has free action.

  [Text] Unofficial sources have informed EL DIARIO DE 
CARACAS that Venezuela is willing to accept a small number of 
Haitians who meet political refugee requirements for a short 
period of time until the UN High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR) finds another country in which they can reside 
permanently. 
  The Haitian issue will be included on the agenda for talks 
that will be held in Caracas with U.S. Under Secretary of State 
Strobe Talbott. The sources also stressed that the United States 
has tried on several occasions to convince the Venezuelan 
Government to accept Haitian refugees. The UNHCR also has been 
negotiating directly with Venezuela on the issue, and Venezuela 
has replied that it is willing to grant temporary asylum because 
of the unique situation Haiti is now experiencing. 
  Talbott will arrive in Venezuela on the evening of 2 June 
with a delegation that will include Alexander Watson, assistant 
U.S. secretary of state for inter-American affairs. Meanwhile, 
U.S. Ambassador to Venezuela Jeffrey Davidow said: "Venezuela is 
the only Latin American country that is member of the Friends of 
Haiti group. Venezuela has always played an important role in 
the fight to return democracy to the island." 
  The agenda of the Americas Summit, which will be held in 
Miami later this year, is another important issue that will be 
discussed. Unofficial sources noted that the Unites States is 
interested in proposing a "good government" policy; in other 
words, it wants to propose a fight against corruption.

    [Editorial Report] Lima EL PERUANO in Spanish on 18 May, 
pages A6-A7, carries an approximately 1,300 word unattributed 
report on the results of the "Aries" antiterrorist operation 
against Shining Path [SL] groups that began on 5 April in 
Huanuco, Leoncio Prado Province, which had become a 
narcoterrorist center. 
  The Huallaga Front command and the Armed Forces Joint 
command 
stepped up actions to destroy the most radical and bloodthirsty 
Shining Path groups, namely the Peoples Guerrilla Army which 
basically comprises the "Mar Rojo"--which has 300 members 
divided into three or more companies--and the "Fuerza Local" 
battalions. 
  At the start of the operation there were 250 "terrorists" 
hiding in Huallaga, armed with North Korean AKM machine guns and 
RPG grenade launchers supplied by drug traffickers. Some 
repentant SL members said the "terrorists" had occupied some 
villages and formed "defense committees" using peasants as 
guides and shields. 
  Troops were dropped by helicopter a few kilometers from the 
SL groups so as to take them by surprise. The theater of 
operations includes the rural areas of Jose Crespo y Castillo 
and Rupa Rupa in Leoncio Prado. Pamphlets persuading named 
"terrorists" to surrender were distributed in nearby villages. 
Although this initiative did not persuade any SL leaders to 
surrender it encouraged civilians who for years have been forced 
to cooperate with the "terrorists" to hand themselves in. 
  Operations in the Huallaga Front this year have so far 
encouraged 500 "terrorists" to benefit from the repentance law, 
while another 2,500 are currently in the process of doing so. 
  The controversy stirred up by the Aries operation due to 
alleged human rights violations hindered the operation for six 
days, thus allowing the "terrorists" to regroup and escape the 
security forces cordon. One of the main leaders to flee was Jose 
Picon Hilario, aka El Manco, who recently murdered two 
government officials in Pucayacu. 
  The Army has recovered many zones that were under SL 
dominance. For example the town of Bella, which was under SL 
dominance for the past 10 years, was recovered by security 
forces in September 1992. Since January, following the last SL 
attack that resulted in the death of 25 of its 300 inhabitants, 
Bella has not experienced any acts of violence. The same goes 
for Aucayacu, Naranjillo, Madre Mia, Uchiza, and Cueva de las 
Lechuzas, etc. 
  The SL has lost the corridor through Chiquian, the capital 
of 
Bolognesi Province, that was used by the "terrorists" to go from 
Huanuco to Pativilca. 
  Some 80 percent of the "terrorists" have been "eradicated" 
from Huallaga and the days are numbered for the remaining 20 
percent in the Cuchara, Primavera, and Yanajanca regions, and a 
new region that includes the Quillaymarca River bank and Santa 
Marta in Maranon Province.

  [Text] Defense Minister Rafael Pardo Ruedas has expressed 
surprise with a statement made by a U.S. State Department 
spokesman yesterday. The spokesman said his country has decided 
to suspend the supply of information from the radars that 
operate in Leticia and Aracura because Colombian military 
authorities had downed planes. Minister Pardo Ruedas told 
Caracol the following: 
  [Begin recording] [Pardo Ruedas] Thus, it seems to us 
that.... [pauses] it is a startling decision. We do not have 
any final position apart from the one that a signatory of a 
multilateral agreement has unilaterally decided -- without prior 
announcement or explanations -- to suspend its participation. 
  [Gonzalvez] Could any preceding events have led the United 
States to make this decision, minister? 
  [Pardo Ruedas] This is what we would like to know. [Words 
indistinct] multilateral cooperation that is advantageous to us 
and other countries. We work on a par with other countries. It 
is advantageous to all those who are interested in controlling 
drug trafficking. We do not understand why a decision has been 
made abruptly and without advising, consulting, or giving 
reasons for it. 
  [Gonzalvez] Perhaps they fear the wrong plane will be downed 
due to information given? 
  [Pardo Ruedas] However, they would have to report this and 
discuss it with us. This decision cannot be based simply on 
[words indistinct] a meeting without, for example, taking in 
account our opinion. [end recording] 
  Other Defense Ministry spokesmen told Caracol that while the 
U.S. Government suspends the supply of radar information to 
Colombia, it congratulates the Peruvian Government each time it 
downs a plane.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Nuclear Thaw"] </F>
  [Text] Brazil took exactly 17 years to sign the Tlatelolco 
Treaty for the denuclearization of Latin America. The signing of 
the treaty by Foreign Minister Celso Amorim in Mexico City on 30 
May closed a period that was filled with distrust and 
misunderstanding. This period was fueled by the Cold War, the 
Brazil-Argentina rivalry, alignment and misalignment, and an era 
that -- in the end and hopefully for a long time -- was buried 
after the fall of the Berlin Wall. 
  Brazil and Argentina signed the treaty in 1967 but did not 
ratify it. Brazil informed the preparatory commission that it 
considered that Article 18 of the treaty authorized signatory 
countries to make nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes 
including "the detonation of devices similar to the ones used in 
military weapons." This interpretation clashed with that of the 
United States, which was outlined during the signing of the 
additional Protocol 11. This disagreement lasted almost two 
decades. 
  But the world has undergone such big changes with the 
deterioration of one of the superpowers -- the Soviet empire -- 
that it did not make sense to insist on the same points, as if 
the Cold War were still polluting the diplomatic atmosphere. 
Everything began with the 1962 missile crisis involving Kennedy 
and Kruschev, when the USSR attempted to install a nuclear base 
in Cuba. 
  The Tlatelolco Treaty set a world precedent, hailed by the 
UN 
secretary general as a "major factor in the long and difficult 
fight for disarmament." A treaty had been signed in 1959 to 
preserve Antarctica. The accumulation of nuclear weapons in 
space was banned in 1966. The Tlatelolco Treaty made Latin 
America the first inhabited region to be declared a banned 
territory for the production of nuclear weapons and weapons of 
mass destruction. 
  The safeguards demanded by Argentina and Brazil, however, 
seemed unacceptable to the United States, which did not agree to 
including Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands in the "banned 
area" because of the existence of U.S. bases in those places. 
Then-Panamanian chief of state Omar Torrijos said the United 
States kept nuclear weapons in stock in the Panama Canal zone. 
  Furthermore, at the end of the 1960's, when the treaty was 
signed in the Mexican city of Tlatelolco, Brazil and Argentina 
were in the middle of an arms race to be the first to detonate a 
nuclear bomb. The regional thaw began in 1985 when [Presidents] 
Sarney and Alfonsin visited Argentina's nuclear facilities, 
reaching a climax when [Presidents] Collor and Menem opened 
their nuclear facilities to mutual inspection. Last month, two 
days before Brazil decided to fully join the treaty following 
the Senate's approval, Strategic Affairs Secretary Admiral Mario 
Cesar Flores said: "If we do not want to produce a nuclear bomb, 
there is no reason to fear ratifying the treaty." 
  In the end, as Celso Amorim said in Mexico City, the 
Tlatelolco Treaty was freely signed by each of the 30 signatory 
countries "without any imposition whatsoever." Gone is the "Cold 
War period, full of tension, distrust, and uncertainty," and the 
denuclearization commitments that "entailed arbitrary limits on 
the use of nuclear energy and sophisticated technology for 
legitimate purposes." 
  Brazil could not have done otherwise at a time when the 
United States and Russia have agreed to no longer aim their 
long-range missiles at cities and strategic targets in each 
country. The 21st century has practically begun.

  [Text] Brasilia -- During its convention on 29 May in 
Brasilia, the Party for the Redefinition of the National Order 
[PRONA] officially appointed Dr. Eneas Ferreira Carneiro its 
presidential candidate. He was unanimously appointed by the 28 
candidates. The party's vice presidential candidate is Rio de 
Janeiro-born Rear Admiral Roberto Gama e Silva, who was 
president of the Low Amazonas Studies Group [Grupo de Estudos do 
Baixo Amazonas -- Gebam] during Joao Figueiredo's administration. 
  The main banner of PRONA's program, which is still being 
drafted, is a strong government. Carneiro believes that only by 
intervening in the macroeconomic structure can the government 
ensure high-quality public schools and health programs. With his 
rights to 60 seconds of free television propaganda time -- three 
times longer than what he had in the last elections -- Carneiro 
plans to attract "two-thirds of the voters who still are 
undecided." 
  In the 1989 election, PRONA had 360,000 votes. This is 
equivalent to 0.5 percent of the total number of votes. In this 
year's elections, the party has its position in the presidential 
race ensured by the representation of Deputy Regina Gordilho 
(Rio de Janeiro) in Congress and has gubernatorial candidates in 
at least 15 states. Carneiro said: "We are not joking. Our party 
is the only serious thing that exists in the country nowadays."

  [Text] They do not give up. After lending their party's 
name to the maharajah hunter [Fernando Collor de Mello] -- who 
managed to reach the presidency in 1990 only to be impeached two 
years later on charges of deep involvement in corruption -- 
yesterday, 49 delegates of the PRN [National Reconstruction 
Party] nominated businessman Walter Carlos Gomes Queiroz as PRN 
candidate for replacing President Itamar Franco. 
  Speaking at the end of the convention, Gomes Queiroz said: 
"I 
am going to win the election." He did not appear, however, 
anywhere near as obstinate as his predecessor, who was 
conspicuously absent at the convention. PRN President Daniel 
Tourinho said: "President Fernando Collor continues to remain in 
seclusion, but he will participate in all of our rallies." 
  Gomes Queiroz employs 100 workers at his sunglass factory in 
Salvador, Bahia State. He is 38 years old, just as Fernando 
Collor was when he began his electoral campaign in 1989. PRN 
National Secretary Rivalinton Veloso da Silva said that Gomes 
Queiroz fits the profile obtained in a survey of voters: "a 
middle-aged man, clean, who is not a professional politician."

Gerais Natives Rule PT and PSDB in Presidential Race" 
  [Text] The PT [Workers Party] and the PSDB [Brazilian 
Social Democracy Party] are going into the election battle 
headed by two natives of Minas Gerais: Ruy Falcao and Pimenta da 
Veiga. They share a reputation for being intransigent. Falcao, 
the PT's new president, has distinguished himself in the party 
as a guardian of ideological purity. PSDB members in Minas 
Gerais say that centralized decisionmaking is a shortcoming on 
the part of Pimenta, who will take over as the PSDB's president 
next week. 
<H5>  Pimenta da Veiga: Back After 1990 Defeat </H5>
  Belo Horizonte -- The PSDB's new president, attorney Joao 
Pimenta da Veiga, Jr., whose election is expected to be ratified 
at the party convention next Saturday, is a stubborn man. He has 
a strong personality, does not follow advice, and always has the 
last word. At 46 years of age, Pimenta da Veiga has collected 
electoral successes in his political career, but the ballot box 
has also brought him disappointment. After being defeated in the 
Minas Gerais gubernatorial race in 1990, he abandoned everything 
and went to Brasilia to practice law. 
  Pimenta da Veiga began his political career in the PMDB 
[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]. He inherited the 
electoral prestige of his father, attorney Joao Pimenta da 
Veiga, who was a deputy. He served three terms in the Chamber of 
Deputies, being elected in 1978, 1982, and 1986. He was 
appointed leader of the PMDB by Tancredo Neves in the second of 
those elections and was retained in that post by former 
President Jose Sarney. 
  In 1988, he left the PMDB to establish the PSDB and was 
elected mayor of Belo Horizonte. As mayor, Pimenta da Veiga 
achieved a level of popularity convincing him that he could 
reach greater heights. He left the city in the hands of Deputy 
Mayor Eduardo Azeredo and began campaigning as an unbeatable 
candidate. His intransigence led him to make fatal mistakes. 
  The campaign's coordinators felt that Pimenta should pay 
more 
attention to TV programs. To do so, he would have to do less 
traveling. But the candidate felt that visits to the 
municipalities were more important. He almost came to blows with 
the then president of the Minas Gerais PSDB and candidate for 
the Senate, Carlos Mosconi, who felt mistreated. 
  Concerned about the political exploitation of Pimenta's 
personal life, advisers counseled him to maintain the greatest 
discretion in his amorous relationship with young Ana Paola 
Frade (with whom he is now married and has two children), since 
his separation from his first wife was very recent. Pimenta da 
Veiga did not agree, and Ana, who was his girlfriend at the 
time, participated actively in his campaign. 
  There was general surprise when Pimenta lost the election in 
the first round to Helio Garcia. Defeated, he turned his back on 
Minas Gerais politics. He went to Brasilia with Ana and began 
practicing law in the higher courts, keeping only the decorative 
post of vice president of the PSDB. Pimenta has said that he 
will assume the presidency of the party against his will. He 
would prefer to act behind the scenes on behalf of Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso's candidacy by "helping in the coordination." 
Pimenta has supported the PSDB's alliance with the PFL [Liberal 
Front Party] from the start. According to him, coalitions are 
essential if the next president is to be able to govern. 
"Without a political base, any president will be isolated," he 
said. 
<H5>  Falcao: Disciplined and Inflexible Organizer </H5>
  Brasilia -- Ruy Falcao, the son of a Bahia family, was born 
in Minas Gerais and raised in Sao Paulo. He lacks the charisma 
of his predecessor, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, but exhibits a 
characteristic that is praised by "comrades" and opponents: he 
is disciplined and a hard worker. Considered one of the toughest 
members of the PT leadership, he assumed the presidency of the 
party last Sunday after helping Lula put together a more 
realistic and moderate government program than the extreme Left 
wanted. "I will be the president not of a faction but of the 
party," he said as he took office, thus sending a clear message 
to those PT members who, along with him, make up the Hour of 
Truth group. 
  As a member of the leftist organization VAR [Revolutionary 
Armed Vanguard]-Palmares, Falcao was arrested by the 
dictatorship in 1970. He spent three years in a military prison 
on Pedras Blancas Island in the Guaiba River. He left jail in 
1973 and resumed his career as a journalist. He contributed to 
the alternative newspapers MOVIMENTO and EM TEMPO and worked for 
the magazine NOVA and Tupi TV until 1977, when he went to work 
for the magazine EXAME. He left that job in 1988 to devote 
himself exclusively to the PT. Never since then has he entered 
an indoor soccer court. "Now I lead a sedentary life," he says. 
  Falcao's sedentary life invariably begins at 0500. He sleeps 
only four hours or a maximum of five hours a night. In fact, he 
sleeps little, eats little, speaks little, and laughs little. He 
also spends little. Called a miser, he says he is a man who 
leads a simple life. His opponents view him as a negotiator who 
is tough and ordinarily intransigent and radical. He says no: 
"I'm not tough; I am a person with firm convictions," says 
Falcao, who even considers himself a moderate. He is skillful. 
"I know how to negotiate; I am a very reasonable coordinator." 
  Falcao may be both. Journalists who knew him back when he 
was 
competing to head the Sao Paulo union say that he would not 
budge an inch from his positions while working fiercely to 
defeat his opponents. His enemies called him "the sinister 
dwarf." Falcao is slightly over 1.60 meters tall. Someone who 
worked with him at EXAME says he is a friendly colleague in 
everyday dealings. 
  He was one of the chief opponents of the PT deputies who 
wanted to decide for themselves whether to participate in 
constitutional revision. Although accused of having "no play in 
his belt," Falcao showed at the convention that he can act 
according to circumstances--in this case, the presidential 
election. 
  Falcao, who is a state deputy in Sao Paulo, is going to run 
for reelection: "As president-elect of the republic, Lula will 
be legally prevented from reassuming the presidency of the PT," 
he jokes, but he is serious.

<F P=106> [Article by Oswaldo Buarim, Jr.: "Ideas of the PT's Top Man </F>
in Economics"] 
  [Text] Brasilia -- The potential minister of finance in a 
PT [Workers Party] administration, Deputy Aloizio Mercadante, 
43, was one of the most active coordinators of the party's 
pacification at its latest national convention, which was held 
in Brasilia last weekend. He worked behind the scenes to ensure 
that the PT's radicals would not force inclusion in the 
government program of items such as decreeing a moratorium on 
the foreign debt if Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is elected 
president of the republic. This week he is accompanying Lula to 
the United States, where they will discuss the party's ideas on 
the economy with U.S. politicians and businessmen, and he 
promises to convey the message that a PT administration will 
want foreign investment in our country but that it will demand 
that the problem of the Third World's indebtedness be dealt with 
politically. "The stands we will present to the bankers are the 
same as those we defend in Congress or at the factory gates." 
  Holding a doctorate in economics from the Campinas PUC 
[Pontifical Catholic University], which is also where the core 
of former Minister Zelia Cardoso de Mello's team came from, 
Mercadante feels that the FHC [Fernando Henrique Cardoso] Plan 
is a "time bomb" that will generate a fiscal, foreign exchange, 
and banking crisis in 1995. According to him, dollarizing the 
economy will make a mess of domestic industry, and the small 
banks will find it hard to survive. In his opinion, the 
electioneering objective behind the plan will make the problem 
of the fiscal deficit worse because Itamar's administration is 
going to spend the money it has and money it does not have to 
get Fernando Henrique Cardoso elected. 
<H5>  Bombs </H5>
  "If dollarization becomes a reality, it will be a fiscal, 
foreign exchange, and banking bomb that is likely to explode in 
1995. The foreign exchange reserves have been artificially 
inflated by the policy on domestic interest rates, with serious 
repercussions on the public sector's indebtedness. The delay in 
foreign exchange payments will encourage imports, harm exports, 
and compromise the trade balance and the balance of payments. 
Conditions in the international economy are also beginning to 
reverse the situation of the past two and a half years, which 
was favorable and made a net inflow of capital into Brazil 
possible. Now we are seeing a flight of capital from Mexico, 
Argentina, Venezuela, and Brazil itself." 
<H5>  Foreign Debt </H5>
  "A very bad agreement was reached. Renegotiation achieved 
some reduction in the amount owed and an extension of repayment 
schedules, but not enough, with the result that the foreign 
exchange crisis may become worse. Creditors will find 
negotiators in the PT, but they will be tough negotiators. We 
are going to politicize and emphasize the issue of the foreign 
debt. Agreement needs to be reached by the next administration, 
since it presumably will be stronger politically and have more 
negotiating strength and credibility, and also because the level 
of reserves required of our country is absolutely unacceptable. 
Brazil has $35 billion in reserves. That is the international 
economy's third-largest trade balance in absolute terms and its 
highest as a percentage of GDP [gross domestic product]." 
<H5>  Inflation </H5>
  "The plan may halt inflation briefly, but I do not see any 
consistency in the proposal because a balanced budget is not 
guaranteed. We have seen a series of mistakes in connection with 
the introduction of the URV [real unit of value], one of which 
is inflation in URV terms that is already contaminating the 
future currency." 
<H5>  Dollarization </H5>
  "The backing for the issue of currency is harmful because 
having parity without convertibility is not safe. In Argentina, 
the market feels secure because there you can exchange pesos for 
dollars. In Brazil, there is no use imagining parity because the 
volume of reserves is insufficient for the remonetization that 
may exist in the economy at the time of stabilization. The 
second problem is that by dollarizing, our country will lose 
control of its own currency. The Central Bank will end up being 
a branch of the U.S. Federal Reserve. In the area of exports, 
our country must realize that it is not Argentina or Chile. We 
are not kiwi producers." 
<H5>  Sectoral Chambers </H5>
  "Separately, they do not solve anything. But they are an 
auxiliary mechanism in stabilization programs because they 
operate as an income policy. In the chamber of the automobile 
industry, there was a reduction in tax rates, profit margins, 
and vehicle prices. The result was that Brazil rose from 12th to 
ninth place among the world's biggest automobile producing 
countries, with record production of 1.3 million vehicles in 
1993--a 30-percent increase over the previous record. In 
addition, over 12,000 new jobs were created, there was a 
21-percent increase in the industry's real wages, and tax 
revenues rose by $2.8 billion." 
<H5>  Predetermined Interest Rates </H5>
  "We suggested this possibility when inflation stood at 16 
percent. Afterward, when prices were deregulated as part of the 
move toward the URV, there was a sudden transfer of income from 
wage earners to the firms. We have suggested that the minister 
initiate a gradual deflation process accompanied by other 
economic measures such as a tax reform, which is essential in 
order to do away with this distorted structure." 
<H5>  Plan and Consequences </H5>
  "If there is dollarization, we will fall into a trap 
carrying 
a very high economic and social cost. The delay in foreign 
exchange payments will harm exports and compromise economic 
growth. Consumption may actually heat up at first because 
inertial inflation will take off from that level. But it will 
straitjacket foreign exchange and make deindustrialization 
worse." 
<H5>  PT Program </H5>
  "We want foreign investments, clear and permanent rules, and 
credibility in relations with businessmen from outside the 
country, but we also want to carry out structural reforms. We 
want to distribute income, power, and knowledge in Brazil."

<F P=106> [By Javier Rodriguez] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 2 Jun (PL) -- Today, Acting Foreign Minister 
Isabel Allende met with a Belgian delegation to discuss the 
situation created by the illegal occupation of the Belgian 
ambassador's residence. 
  Foreign Ministry sources told PRENSA LATINA that today at 
the 
Foreign Ministry, Allende, accompanied by Serafin Rodriguez, 
head of the ministry's Europe Directorate, received Belgian 
Government special envoy Willy Verriest and Paul Vermkirsch, 
head of the Belgian delegation in Cuba. 
  The discussion centered on reviewing formulas and mechanisms 
necessary for finding a final solution to the problem that began 
on Saturday with the occupation of the building. 
  In addition, the Belgian delegation officially reported to 
the Cuban ministry that three more occupants have left the 
building. In all, four people have changed their minds and 
returned home without being stopped or otherwise disturbed by 
local authorities. The envoys report that 122 people -- 66 men, 
32 women, and 24 children -- remain in the building. 
  The source denied that Cuban authorities have encountered 
any 
difficulties in feeding these individuals. The source also 
noted that there are a number of enterprises that provide such 
supplies to diplomatic offices in the country. 
  The meeting also took note of the wide coverage 
international 
newspapers and television stations have given to several 
documents released by the people inside the ambassador's 
residence. Some of these documents are political statements. 
  PRENSA LATINA has learned that Cuban authorities are 
maintaining a security cordon around the occupied building, not 
only as part of their duty to the diplomatic representatives 
accredited in the island, but also in response to an explicit 
request from the Belgian Government. 
  One conclusion reached at today's talks was that both sides 
favor a solution in which those people illegally occupying the 
building vacate it and obey all legal procedures for traveling 
abroad.

  [Text] Havana, 1 Jun (PL) -- A special Belgian Government 
envoy is in Cuba participating in the talks to find a solution 
to the situation caused by the illegal occupation of the Belgian 
ambassador's residence in this capital. 
  Cuban Foreign Ministry sources confirmed to PRENSA LATINA 
yesterday's arrival in Havana of Ambassador Willy Verriest, who 
has already met with acting Foreign Minister Isabel Allende. 
  The Cuban side described this meeting as positive. The 
diplomat's presence in the country is considered a demonstration 
of Belgium's interest in obtaining a satisfactory solution to 
the incident. 
  Cuba and Belgium agree on the illegal nature of the forced 
entry into the building, which has been occupied by a group of 
people since Saturday in an attempt to force the foreign mission 
to enable them to leave the country without carrying out the 
normal procedures established for leaving. 
  It has been learned that Verriest was ambassador to Cuba 
from 
November 1986 to February 1990 and now holds a high position in 
the Belgian Foreign Ministry. 
  Parallel to his initial activities in Cuba, it was reported 
that Alfredo Morales, Cuban ad interim charge d'affaires in 
Brussels, has met with Belgian Foreign Ministry officials, 
especially the chief of staff of that Ministry. 
  The objective of that meeting was also to exchange ideas and 
positions on the development of the negotiations begun by the 
two parties immediately after the occupation of the Belgian 
ambassador's residence in Cuba. 
  Cuban Foreign Ministry officials consulted by PRENSA LATINA 
reaffirmed the normal nature of the negotiations, which are 
being conducted in accordance with the international customs and 
regulations that exist for these types of cases. 
  The Cuban position, which is shared by the Belgian mission, 
is that of facilitating the departure from the diplomatic 
residence of all the people who violated its 
extraterritoriality, independent of whether afterwards and in 
accordance with pesent legal provisions, they begin the 
appropriate steps to leave the country.

  [Text] Kingston, 2 Jun (PL) -- Jamaican Prime Minister 
Percival Patterson has confirmed, here before Parliament, that 
his government will allow the United States to use Jamaican 
territory to process Haitians intercepted on the high seas. 
  The next group of Haitians detained on the high seas will be 
taken to Jamaica, where U.S. vessels anchored in the ports of 
Kingston, Port Antonio, and Montego Bay will be converted into 
floating platforms to conduct interviews and to provide 
temporary shelter for those seeking asylum. 
  Reports from Washington note that the U.S. Navy hospital 
ship 
"Comfort," with a capacity of 1,000 beds, has sailed from 
Norfolk, Virginia, for Kingston and that another vessel, flying 
the Ukrainian flag, may also leave Tampa en route to Kingston. 
  Labor leader Edward Seaga voiced opposition to the 
government's decision. Although he stressed he supported Bill 
Clinton's change in policy of not returning the Haitians without 
a preliminary hearing, he said it was unacceptable to use 
Jamaican territory to do this. 
  Patterson disclosed that on Wednesday, U.S. and Jamaican 
specialists worked out a bilateral memorandum of understanding 
to outline each side's responsibility and in which the White 
House has promised to pay all operational expenses for the six 
months Jamaica has granted. 
  Some observers believe strong pressure has been exerted on 
Jamaica, which opposed this idea at the beginning, but the 
presence of a high-level delegation proved that the report was 
not merely media rumors. The delegation included U.S. Under 
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott; William H. Gray, President 
Clinton's special adviser on Haitian affairs; and eight other 
officials. 
  Several analysts believe there is a consensus among members 
of the Caribbean Common Market (Caricom) on the commitment they 
must make as a regional organization to resolve the Haitian 
crisis and to help President Jean-Bertrand Aristide return to 
his post as well as to cooperate in reestablishing democracy in 
the neighboring country.

  [Text] Havana, 2 Jun (PL) -- Today, the Cuban newspaper 
GRANMA reiterated its rejection of William Clinton's recent 
statements by considering them a demonstration of U.S. 
Government interest in continuing to promote an atmosphere of 
confrontation with Cuba. 
  In a lengthy commentary entitled "Public Letter to a 
President" (Clinton), GRANMA said the alleged 20 May message by 
the U.S. President to Cuba is also a good example of the 
ignorance of realities that have characterized Cuba's history 
and its relations with the United States. 
  After highlighting the negative aspects of the significance 
of 20 May 1902 for Cuba and clarifying the pro-independence 
ideas of national hero Jose Marti, the author considered it 
profane to manipulate Marti's figure and name after radio 
stations that pursue objectives against those for which he 
fought. 
  Commenting on the White House's position of repeatedly 
denying visas to nationals who meet all the requirements and, on 
the contrary, promoting illegal departures, the commentary warns 
that "cynical and opportunistic" policies always turn against 
those who create them. 
  "Today, they tighten the blockade to promote emigration; 
they 
promote emigration but your Interests Section denies thousands 
of visas. They deny visas but have no problems receiving those 
who are able to reach the coasts of Florida in flimsy boats or 
are able to seize one," the commentary stated. 
  And the commentary asks: "How long do you think this winding 
circle will last without exploding and turning against you?" 
  For the commentator, when the U.S. middle class, which 
allowed Clinton to reach the presidency, learns and understands, 
among other things, that Washington defines its policy toward 
Cuba following the interests of the meager community of 
immigrants, the Cuban American Foundation (terrorist group 
founded by the CIA), the blockade, and 20 May messages will end. 
  According to the article [as published], the hour of honor 
for the United States will come that day "because that powerful 
nation, which is trying to starve those who have committed the 
sole crime of struggling for their ideas and their right to be 
free and independent into submission, will never be considered 
complete or just."

<F P=106> [By Froilan Arencibia] </F>
  [Text] Cairo, 1 Jun (PL) -- Today, Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina demanded that the veto power held by members of 
the UN Security Council be abolished, calling the veto an unfair 
and unequal right. 
  According to a reliable source, Robaina said in a 
closed-door 
meeting of the 11th ministerial conference being held in this 
city that the Nonaligned Movement (NAM) should oppose those who 
attempt to use the Security Council to implement their foreign 
policies and to intervene in the affairs of other governments. 
  We not only have to defend our right to participate but also 
our right to know, the head of Cuban diplomacy official 
proclaimed, according to the same source. 
  The Cuban foreign minister added that nonaligned nations and 
other developing countries have to claim their legitimate right 
to participate on equal footing in the council and to demand 
that the privileges enjoyed by a handful of powers be eliminated. 
  He stressed that it is as urgent to broaden this UN 
organization as it is to reform its methods and to introduce 
transparency in the way it conducts business. 
  On this issue, he pointed out that not only does the 
Security 
Council give itself the authority to try to dictate its will 
worldwide, but it usually does this covertly. 
  "The steps we must take to revitalize the General Assembly 
and to allow it to exercise the power and functions actually 
granted to it by the UN Charter should be a top priority of the 
NAM," the foreign minister emphasized. 
  In addition to discussing the need to democratize the United 
Nations, the ministers and delegation heads at the meeting 
studied ways to introduce transparency in the activities of the 
world organization, the need to deal with regional conflicts, 
and how to give the NAM a more active role in the international 
community. 
  The ministers and delegation heads agreed on the importance 
of revitalizing the role and functions of the General Assembly 
and outlined the possibility of broadening the Security Council. 
  The draft of the final declaration of the NAM meeting -- 
which PRENSA LATINA was not able to obtain -- defends the 
essence of the group, despite the end of the Cold War and the 
disappearance of the bloc policy. 
  Furthermore, it asserts the validity of the movement and 
calls for the intensification of efforts to make it more 
effective in the international area to give it greater 
negotiating power with industrialized nations. 
  The document recognizes the work done by Indonesia as head 
of 
the organization and expresses satisfaction that many of the 
NAM's principles and positions at the Jakarta summit were 
reflected in the resolutions issued by the 48th Session of the 
UN General Assembly. The ministerial meeting also looked into 
regional conflicts such as the ones in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
Yemen, Ruanda, Angola, among others. 
  During the day, the Cuban foreign minister held meetings 
with 
the delegation heads and foreign ministers of Kenya, Belize, 
South Africa, Ghana, Qatar, Palestine, Algeria, and Ecuador. 
  At the inaugural meeting on Tuesday, Robaina pointed out 
that 
the NAM's top priority should be the promotion of the Third 
World's economic and social development. He said his country 
believes the best guarantee for a firm and lasting peace is the 
absence of hunger. Only in this way, he added, will human 
rights for all of the inhabitants of the planet flourish, and 
not simply for a small part of mankind. 
  The head of Cuban diplomacy met with his colleagues from 
Zimbabwe, Iraq, Vietnam, Honduras, and the secretary general of 
the Arab League on the previous evening. The NAM meeting is 
expected to end with the approval of a final document on Friday.

  [Text] Havana, 31 May (PL) -- With the decision to discuss 
economic, integration, and commercial issues, the Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit will move beyond discussions of a common 
history, language, and culture to give itself a new dimmension. 
  In an article published in the latest issue of the magazine 
PRISMA, Foreign Minister Robaina says there is an idea of adding 
an economic dimension to the association of all those nations. 
  After saying that Cuba has always been in favor of a united 
Latin America, Robaina noted that it is necessary to coalesce 
all the ongoing subregional processes. 
  He added that concurrently, we must defend common positions 
on political, economic, and social matters, especially matters 
dealing with regional integration and the participation of the 
subcontinent in international relations on a just basis. 
  As Robaina sees it, for this to happen, it is necessary to 
progressively engage the integration of the production and 
services sectors without disregarding science, technology, 
health, or education as vital tools for an irreversible and 
permanent integration. 
  Robaina said this process could be a suitable framework for 
Cuba to make available its achievements and experiences in 
social development matters to the region, disregarding 
ideologies, to resolve common problems requiring urgent 
solutions. 
  Robaina said his country will go to the Cartagena de Indias 
summit with the intention of contributing to the strengthening 
of that important forum at a moment when the hemispheric summit 
convoked by the United States works against the Ibero-American 
conferences. Robaina said the Ibero-American Summit remains as 
a mechanism for concerted actions. 
  The new U.S. democratic Government is trying to exploit the 
successful approval of NAFTA to protect a good image on the 
continent and to recover lost ground, Robaina said. 
  After cautioning that Latin America and the Caribbean know 
they cannot have too many illusions about the results of 
Washington-called summits, Robaina explained that such meetings 
make a lot of fuss and yield little. 
  The Cuban foreign minister noted that the hemispheric 
meeting 
must be used not to serve the specific interests of the United 
States, but those of the participant countries and for this 
reason, the date, site, agenda, and participation for the 
meeting should be the result of a common agreement and not a 
unipolar mandate by Washington.

  [Text] Mexico City, 30 May (PL) -- According to an 
authorization request presented to the National Congress today 
[30 May], Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will pay 
an official visit to Cuba toward the middle of next month. 
  Salinas will fly to Havana and then continue on to Cartagena 
de Indias to attend the Fourth Ibero-American Summit. In his 
request to the National Congress, the Mexican president says 
Mexico and Cuba maintain respectful diplomatic relations. He 
highlights the fact that the island is part of Mexico's border 
in the Caribbean. 
  Salinas also states that the ties between Mexico and Cuba 
have, throughout history and within the context of their 
respectful bilateral relationship, been marked by warm ties 
between the two peoples and offered a gateway for international 
cooperation. This has come to symbolize the importance of such 
contacts. 
  In his request, Salinas also points out that the profound 
and 
fruitful political dialogue between Cuba and Mexico, at the 
highest levels, has opened the way for all of Mexico's 
presidents since 1975 to visit the island during their 
presidential term. 
  He recalls that Cuban President Fidel Castro has also 
visited 
Mexico on three occasions during the current administration (for 
the Salinas de Gortari inauguration in 1988, then to attend the 
meeting of the Group of Three [G-3] held on Cozumel Island in 
1993, and to participate in the First Ibero-American Summit in 
Guadalajara, also in 1993). 
  The request concludes that the presence of the Mexican head 
of state in Cuba will serve to promote an even closer bilateral 
relationship, examine the countries' joint agenda, and explore 
new ways of diversifying and strengthening their ties. This 
visit to Cuba was previously scheduled for last January, but was 
postponed due to the armed conflict that broke out in the 
southern State of Chiapas. 
  Regarding the Ibero-American Summit, Salinas states in his 
request that this type of meeting has proven its value as a 
political forum at the highest level and as an instrument to 
promote agreement in fields such as education, science, culture, 
Indian development, international law, and social and economic 
development. He stated that among the Mexican president's 
reasons for going to Cartagena de Indias is that the G-3 nations 
(Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela) planned to sign the Economic 
Complementary Agreement during their stay. 
  The first meeting of the presidents of Latin America, Spain, 
and Portugal took place in the Mexican city of Guadalajara in 
1991. It was followed by similar meetings in Madrid, Spain in 
1992, and Salvador de Bahia, Brazil, in 1993. 
  Salinas will end his six-year term in office in December of 
this year after the federal election on August 21.

<F P=106> [Article entitled: "Mexican President Has Been Authorized To </F>
Visit Havana"] 
  [Text] Mexico City, 1 Jun (PL) -- Today, the Mexican 
Chamber of Deputies authorized President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari to officially visit Havana around the middle of June. 
  Once the decision was known, Deputy Rodolfo Becerril 
Straffon, president of the chamber's Foreign Relations 
Commission, cited the importance of Salinas' trip to Havana. 
The trip will occur "at a time when U.S. congressmen want to 
intensify the blockade" against the island, the deputy explained. 
  The media have viewed this statement as a clear allusion to 
U.S. Congressman Robert Torricelli, the author of the U.S. law 
which bears his name and which two years ago intensified the 
economic blockade the United States imposed against Cuba more 
than 30 years ago. 
  Torricelli has just concluded a visit to Mexico where he was 
bitterly criticized by all Mexican political sectors because of 
his desire to supervise the federal elections that will take 
place in this country in August. 
  Becerril said "this (visit by Salinas to Cuba) is a 
demonstration of Mexican solidarity with the Cuban people and 
the norms that guide Mexico's foreign policy." The legislator 
called for the elimination of customs that hurt Latin American 
economies. 
  During the session, the deputy announced the deputies of the 
governing Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] have decided 
to donate one day's salary to Cuba, and "this money will be used 
to buy oil." The deputies of the opposition's Party of the 
Democratic Revolution have joined the PRI deputies in this 
decision. 
  Three days ago in his request to obtain permission to travel 
from the legislative body, Salinas cited the respectful 
diplomatic relations Mexico and Cuba maintain as well as the 
profound ties of affinity between the two nations. 
  During that session, Salinas said the ties with the island 
have produced an international agenda of cooperation that 
demonstrates the importance of existing links. 
  Salinas also said that since 1975, all Mexican presidents in 
office have visited Havana, something that has contributed to an 
intense and fruitful political dialogue at the highest level 
between the two neighboring nations. The Mexican presidents who 
have visited Cuba are: Luis Echeverria (1970-76), Jose Lopez 
Portillo (1976-82), and Miguel de la Madrid (1982-86). 
  Salinas also recalled that Cuban Chief of State Fidel Castro 
has been in Mexico on three occasions during the current Salinas 
administration (at the presidential inauguration in 1988, a 
summit meeting of the Group of Three in Cozumel in 1991, and the 
first conference of Iberian-American presidents in Guadalajara 
that same year). 
  Castro's trip in December 1988 for the Salinas presidential 
inauguration was the Cuban leader's first trip to Mexico in 32 
years. In 1956, he had left from the Mexican port of Tuxpan 
with 82 men to renew the Cuban people's armed struggle, which 
culminated with the victory of the revolution on 1 January 1959. 
  The illustration presented at Mexico's National Congress 
explained that the presence of the Mexican president in Cuba 
will serve to further promote bilateral ties, analyze the agenda 
between the two countries, and explore new ways of diversifying 
and strengthening existing ties.

  [Text] Luanda, 30 May (PL) -- The Angolan authorities have 
always condemned the economic and commercial blockade imposed on 
Cuba by the United States, Angolan Ambassador to Cuba Antonio 
Burity Da Silva has stated. 
  In an extensive interview published today by the daily 
JORNAL 
DE ANGOLA, which has the greatest circulation here, Da Silva 
said his government is opposed to the embargo Washington has 
enforced on Havana for more than 30 years. 
  The diplomat also referred to the current relations between 
this African state and the Latin American state, and he 
described them as very positive. 
  He pointed out that following the political and economic 
changes that have taken place in the world in recent years, ties 
between the two countries had to be adjusted to the new 
situation. Nevertheless, he advocated conserving the traditional 
friendship between both peoples and governments. 
  The ambassador pointed out that mutual cooperation includes 
a number of fields such as education and health, as well as 
others. He added that this cooperation will tend to increase to 
the degree Angola and Cuba emerge from their respective 
difficult situations. 
  On the other hand, he described Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina's visit to Luanda earlier this year as very 
constructive. To this effect, he announced that Angolan Foreign 
Minister Venacio Da Moura will soon be travelling to Cuba to 
reciprocate Robaina's visit.

  [Text] Havana, 1 Jun (PL) -- Honduran Foreign Minister 
Ernesto Paz Aguilar will visit Cuba at the invitation of the 
Foreign Ministry. An authorized Cuban Foreign Ministry source 
confirmed Paz Aguilar's trip to PRENSA LATINA today. The date 
for the trip will be coordinated by the two countries soon. 
  The Honduran foreign minister met with Roberto Robaina, his 
Cuban counterpart, in Cairo, taking advantage of their 
participation in the meeting of foreign ministers of the 
Nonaligned Movement which is being held in the Egyptian capital. 
  On this occasion, he asked Robaina to convey greetings from 
Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina to Cuban President Fidel 
Castro and referred to the possibility of a meeting between the 
two chiefs of state during the upcoming Fourth Ibero-American 
Summit to be held in Cartagena de Indias. 
  Cuba and Honduras do not have diplomatic relations. 
Diplomatic ties were suspended by the Honduran Government in 
April 1961 following an OAS agreement.

<F P=106> [Article for PRENSA LATINA by Cuban journalist and analyst </F>
Nicanor Leon Cotayo: "The Snowball Effect"] 
  [Text] Havana, 29 May (PL) -- While high-ranking government 
spokesmen in Washington reaffirm that the blockade policy 
against Cuba will not change, disapproval for this official 
policy is quietly, but consistently, growing within the United 
States. 
  One of the most significant things to take place within the 
past few weeks is that the issue of the barrier around the 
island is slowly gaining new attention in the U.S. Congress, and 
this time, it is being opposed. 
  Not long ago, as you may recall, several committees within 
the House of Representatives discussed a bill presented by 
Congressman Charles Rangel. The bill called for a complete end 
to the trade embargo. Now, the House Subcommittee on 
Agriculture [as received] implicitly addressed the matter from a 
similar position. This subcommittee held public hearings on 19 
May under the title: Review of the Implications of Trade 
Relations With Cuba on U.S. Agriculture. 
  Several panels comprising members of Congress, experts, 
businessmen, and representatives of organizations related to 
agricultural production companies participated in the hearings. 
  According to several people with whom I spoke and who 
witnessed these proceedings, this time the conclusions moved 
away from the negative conclusions usually voiced at such 
hearings staged by extreme right-wingers from Florida and their 
allies on Capitol Hill. 
  Except for the presentations made by two well-known 
advocates 
of this negative trend -- Lincoln Diaz Balart and Robert 
Menendez -- all other participants focused their opinions and 
questions on the business opportunities offered by the island. 
  The meeting was very technical and focused on economic and 
commercial matters, and it was presided over by Representative 
Timothy Penny, the chairman of the House subcommittee. 
  Incidentally, Penny was forced to call Republican 
Congressman 
Diaz Balart to order when he began listing the virtues of a 
draft law about a Cuba without a revolutionary government. 
  Keeping his composure, Penny made it clear to the speaker 
that the objective of the hearing was to discuss and learn more 
about the possibility of reestablishing trade relations with 
Cuba, and not to discuss or defend any law in particular. 
  As you may also recall, several House committees held 
hearings a few weeks ago to examine Charles Rangel's bill 
against the blockade. This is the first time the U.S. Congress 
has addressed the matter. 
  In addition, for the first time at such meetings, 
businessmen 
expressed their disapproval of the isolation policy against the 
island, and they went on to defend their right to do business 
with Havana. 
  If we compare the final results of these congressional 
hearings and the results of the hearings held by the House 
Subcommittee on Agriculture, we can see that the new "no" we are 
beginning to hear shows that, although Capitol Hill, for the 
most part, supports the trade embargo against Cuba, there is an 
interesting and positive change taking place on this issue, 
which is beginning to roll like a small snowball all across the 
United States.

  [Text] Havana, 29 May (PL) -- Today, the Cuban press is 
spotlighting the great dangers of the illegal attempts to leave 
the country through the Guantanamo naval base, which the United 
States has been illegally occupying since the beginning of the 
century. 
  In this regard, the Sunday weekly JUVENTUD REBELDE uses as 
an 
example the case of two people killed on 12 May while trying to 
reach the U.S. military installation over land; that is, by 
crossing mine fields. 
  According to JUVENTUD REBELDE, the bodies were found two 
days 
later in the area of Paraguay, a swampy area near the waters of 
Guantanamo Bay where they had been led and presumably killed by 
alleged guides, who, in exchange for 20,000 pesos, would 
supposedly help them reach the base. 
  The report also adds the killers, who had already received 
the money after one presented his driving license as 
identification to the brother of one of the murdered 
individuals, were arrested by the police and will be tried in a 
court of law. 
  The weekly publication says Cuban authorities have 
repeatedly 
warned of the risk of attempting to illegally depart the country 
by entering this U.S. installation, which has thousands of mines 
planted around its perimeter. 
  The publication adds that during these illegal attempts at 
emigration, the lives of those that have been lost or the bodies 
that were mutilated were not only of those wishing to leave the 
country but, rather, young border guards "committed more to the 
safety of others than their own." 
  JUVENTUD REBELDE also notes that Cuban dissuasive mechanisms 
will never be enough as long as the generosity with which the 
United States welcomes illegal Cubans keeps boosting the 
expectations of those who want to leave. 
  The publication goes on to explain that the legal 
possibilities of leaving Cuba are limited because the U.S. 
Government grants only a reduced number of visas despite an 
agreement signed by the two countries in 1987 establishing the 
yearly granting of 20,000 U.S. visas. In 1993, it adds, only 
1,600 residents were issued U.S. immigrant visas. 
  According to JUVENTUD REBELDE's commentator, those same 
reasons explain why, during the first months of 1994, another 
1,100 Cubans left Cuba on rafts or rudimentary crafts thereby 
risking their lives.

  [Text] Havana, Jun 1 (PL) -- The Unidad Fortuna Petroleum 
Inc., De Sherrit Inc., and Talisman Energy Inc. have announced 
the discovery of 16 degree API oil in Cardenas Bay to the north 
of western Matanzas Province. This information has been 
confirmed. 
  According to the information, drilling was conducted as deep 
as 3,240 meters, and petroleum with better quality than that 
found at the Varadero resort site was discovered at a depth of 
approximately 2,500 meters. 
  The exploration activity is being carried out under the 
terms 
of a risk contract with the state Cuba Petroleum (Cupet) firm, 
which controls oil-related business in the country and maintains 
risk contracts with several foreign firms. 
  The information released by the Canadian firms and confirmed 
by sources in Cuba's oil sector also notes that the well drilled 
could produce about 3,750 barrels of oil a day. Drilling has 
been stopped, however, to allow nearby areas to be surveyed to 
evaluate the magnitude of the deposit. 
  According to specialists, the crude oil found is superior in 
quality to the oil found in Varadero, which averages between 10 
and 11 degrees API and has a high sulphur content. The oil 
discovered in the Cardenas area has less sulphur and, therefore, 
it will be less difficult to refine. 
  Petroleum exploration in Cuba is divided into 33 sectors, 11 
of which were offered in bids in Calgary, Canada, and London in 
February 1993. 
  Since 1990, Cuba has set up risk contracts with the French 
Total firm and the European Petroleum firm to explore and 
exploit crude oil in the island's territorial waters. 
  Foreign firms exploring for oil in the country are operating 
under risk contracts that grant a maximum term of 25 years (four 
of them corresponding to the exploration phase) and guarantee 
that the firms will be able to freely utilize their agreed upon 
quota of crude oil. 
  In this sense, Juan Fleites Melo, director of the Cuban 
marketing firm Cupet, S.A., recently stated that foreign 
companies will be able to sell part of the petroleum in the 
country at international market prices if they so decide. Also, 
no export taxes are being considered for those who decide to 
sell the product overseas. 
  According to the provisions of this kind of contract, the 
foreign sector supplies all of the capital investment and 
technical means for oil exploration in an established area and 
agrees to leave without any compensation if no oil is discovered. 
  According to experts from the Cuban Basic Industry Ministry, 
seismic studies show very interesting results, particularly in 
the sector located south of Ciego de Avila and Sancti Spiritus 
as well as in the marine areas where the Swedish firm Taurus 
operates. 
  Structures known as reef-like formations in oil geological 
terms have been found in this area. These structures are 
considered very favorable for petroleum deposits. 
  Information available in the foreign companies' zone of 
operation not only reveals the possibility of finding heavy 
crude (90 percent of the total extracted in the country at 
present), but also light crude. 
  Last year, domestic oil production reached 1.2 million tons. 
Oil production for this year is estimated at 1.3 million tons. 
This oil is used in the generation of electricity and the 
production of nickel and glass, as well as in other sectors.

  [Text] Havana, 1 Jun (PL) -- As was announced last year, an 
increase in the prices of cigarettes, alcoholic beverages, and 
air and maritime transportation fees went into effect today in 
the first stage of a series of increases aimed at reducing the 
large amount of currency in circulation. 
  The proposed increase in gasoline prices, which also should 
have gone into effect, was postponed until the next delivery of 
the ration quota assigned to private car owners. 
  An agreement published by the Council of Ministers Executive 
Committee on 23 May established that beginning on 1 June 
cigarette prices would be increased at all three pricing levels. 
  Ration quota prices will increase to 2.00 and 2.50 pesos 
(equal to $2 and $2.50 at Cuba's official exchange rate), 
depending on whether the cigarettes are made from fine or 
regular tobacco. Additional distribution cigarettes will be sold 
at 6.00 and 6.50 pesos, while those sold freely on the market 
will sell for 10.00 and 10.50 pesos. 
  Until yesterday, cigarettes from the basic ration had the 
same price as 30 years ago -- 20 cents for cigarettes made from 
regular tobacco and 30 cents for fine tobacco. The price on the 
so-called additional distribution had been set at 1.60 pesos for 
more than 10 years, while free sales have been gone for more 
than a year because of a lack of supply. 
  The increase represents a tenfold increase for rationed 
cigarettes and a fourfold increase for those whose distribution 
is restricted outside the quota. 
  Beer, whose price will double, will cost 1.20 pesos per 
350-milliliter [ml] bottle, while the price of rum and spirits 
will fluctuate between 20 and 40 pesos per 750-ml bottle. 
  The price of rationed fuel for the approximately 172,000 
privately-owned vehicles nationwide will increase four times and 
will be sold at 1.20 pesos per liter of special gasoline (which 
used to cost 32 cents), at 1 peso per liter of regular gasoline, 
and at 0.75 per liter of oil gasoline or diesel fuel. 
  Other increases in air and maritime fees for transportation 
to and from the Isle of Youth also went into effect today, while 
new bus and railroad fares will go into effect on 1 September. 
  In its efforts to reduce state subsidies, including 100 
million pesos spent annually on labor kitchens, the Council of 
Ministers decided that as of 1 July these expenses will be 
disbursed by the management of the centers in which these 
facilities are located. 
  The new electricity rates, which do not include fines for 
consuming more than 300 kilowatt-hours per month, will begin to 
be implemented in the October billing period. 
  Price and Finance Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez said price 
and 
tax increases are the most effective method to cleanse public 
finances in the short-term. 
  According to the most recent figures released by the Price 
and Finance Ministry, excess cash reportedly reached $12 billion 
on 31 May, while the budget deficit amounted to $4.2 billion on 
31 December 1993. 
  In subsidizing those basic commodities whose prices are not 
increasing at this time, the Cuban state currently spends $365 
million annually. Meanwhile, consumers currently spend 22-23 
pesos per person per month on rationed products. 
  This restricted family basket, along with rent, electricity 
fees, and other fees for public services currently equal 40 
percent of the minimum wage, which is 100 pesos in Cuba.

<F P=106> [Report by Marisol Marin] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 2 Jun (EFE) -- Although three more people 
left the Belgian Embassy in Havana last night, Cuban authorities 
are "very concerned" about the threat of suicide that was in a 
message sent by the 124 refugees to the press on Tuesday. 
  Today, official sources expressed their concern to EFE, both 
for the "threat to commit suicide" and the fact that the 
refugees have formed an organization within the embassy grounds, 
on which they trespassed last Saturday to request asylum. 
  In the message, the refugees announced their decision to 
create an organization called "Union of Cubans for Freedom;" 
they refused to hold talks with the government "for lack of 
guarantees" and said they were ready for anything, "even losing 
their lives." 
  A high-ranking Cuban Foreign Ministry official, who asked 
not 
to be identified, stressed that the Cuban Government "has always 
honored its word and there is proof of that," in reference to 
the promise made to Belgian authorities that the refugees will 
not be punished after leaving the building. 
  The official reiterated that the two countries agree these 
people must leave the building peacefully. The official also 
reported that Willy Verriest, special Belgian Government envoy 
who arrived on Tuesday, is cooperating so the refugees leave the 
embassy as soon as possible." 
  "They have asked for time to convince the refugees and we 
will never violate Belgian territory," explained the source, who 
also complained about "the little cooperation received from the 
head of mission (Paul Veirmeirsch)." 
  Diplomatic sources in Havana remarked that Verriest's 
arrival 
should expedite the solution to the problem, given that 
Ambassador Veirmeirsch seems to have had some communication 
difficulty with Cuban authorities. 
  In short statements to the press, Verriest said the only 
thing that can be done is to convince the refugees to accept the 
guarantees given by the Cuban Government, "but this is not 
easy," he added. Verriest said: "We want a peaceful solution; 
the Cuban Government also wants a peaceful solution. None of us 
wants violence." 
  Up until now, four people have left the diplomatic 
headquarters; one on Sunday and three yesterday. Their 
identities are unknown but, according to observers, they may be 
the last who, unexplainably, managed to enter the compound early 
Saturday morning by avoiding dozens of police. In a message 
sent to the press, the refugees said they suspected those four 
individuals were government security members. 
  Meanwhile, the ambassadors of the European Union in Cuba 
have 
met three times in three consecutive days -- the last time was 
on yesterday, Wednesday -- but none of them has wanted to 
comment to the press. 
  The wives of several ambassadors are actively cooperating in 
supplying food to the refugees and they regularly send snacks 
and other foodstuff, at the request of the Belgian ambassador. 
  From the top of a ladder placed against a tree, a television 
channel was able to film a sort of a rustic scene in the gardens 
of the ambassador's residence yesterday afternoon. The children 
ran and played and the mothers, who were sitting down, were 
spending the afternoon peacefully. When he noticed the camera, 
a man said hello and then, with his hands, made the sign of 
victory.

  [Text] On 2 June, GRANMA published an article by reporter 
Luis Vaies Delgado entitled Public Letter to a President, in 
which he responds to William Clinton's message of 20 May, 
supposedly for the people of Cuba. 
  If we have gotten to where we are now and we are still here, 
it is because we have learned never to make the slightest 
compromise regarding sovereignty and independence. Vaies points 
out that 20 May 1902 is not Cuban Independence Day; it is the 
day that the crime of seizing the independence that the Cuban 
people had fought for for over a third of a century 
pseudojudicially took place. He adds further on in the article: 
We arrived at 20 May 1902 through the cunning and greed of a 
nation that coveted Cuba for a century. After analyzing a number 
of historic events that prove this, Luis Vais responds, clearly 
and precisely, to several of the U.S. President's statements 
regarding our people and his government. In this manner, the 
deceit in those statements is exposed.

<F P=106> [From the "Evening Information Review" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The Cuban daily GRANMA condemned the meddling in 
Mexico's internal matters by Democratic Representative Robert 
Torricelli, who is described as a politics' dealer. An 
extensive editorial by reporter Nicanor Leon Cotayo, highlights 
a wave of repudiation in Mexico of Torricelli's attempt to 
appoint himself a judge of Mexico. He adds that the chairman of 
the Western Hemisphere Affairs Subcommittee of the U.S. House of 
Representatives, this year inaugurated two hearings to examine 
the situation in the state of Chiapas, Mexico, arguing that 
NAFTA grants Washington this right. The U.S. Congressman also 
drew up a draft bill outlining the guidelines the Mexican 
electoral system should follow from now on. 
  GRANMA's article emphasized that Torricelli, once again, 
defends a trend in U.S. policymaking to make meddling in the 
internal matters of other countries state policy. The Cuban 
daily concludes by indicating that what is of most concern is 
the increasing tendency among high-level U.S. officials to 
reveal their true intentions.

  [Text] Beginning today, new sea and air transportation fees 
went into effect nationwide following the 31 May publication of 
Resolution 694 of the Ministry of Finances and Prices in the 
Official Gazette. The resolution points out that children 
younger than two years of age travel free -- proof of age is 
required. It also stipulates that children between two and 12 
years of age will pay 50 percent of the fee, in other words, 
half the cost -- proof of age is required. 
  Beginning today, a Havana-Santiago de Cuba ticket costs 90 
pesos, and a Havana-Baracoa ticket costs 108 pesos. Other 
examples: a ticket to Camaguey costs 72 pesos, and a ticket to 
Isle of Youth is 22 pesos. The hovercraft service between 
Batabano and Nueva Gerona is 11 pesos for adults and 7 pesos for 
children. The maximum luggage weight included in the ticket 
price is 20 kilograms. Excess luggage, in maritime 
transportation, will cost two pesos for each additional kilogram. 
  It is important for the people to be aware that this 
measure, 
which is part of the effort to correct the national finances, is 
not enough to cover the subsidy which the state gives to the 
national aviation carrier in order to serve the population. Air 
transportation of tourists accrues hard currency, yet this is 
not enough to cover the expenses incurred in transportation 
services for the people.

  [Text] According to estimates by specialists, 52.2 percent 
of the population will not be affected by the kilowatt-hour cost 
increase, and the measure will also help to promote energy 
conservation. A family unit that uses 150 kilowatts will pay 19 
pesos more, since the first 100 kilowatts cost nine cents a 
kilowatt, and the other 50 cost 50 cents a kilowatt. This new 
fee will be implemented according to the meter's readout in 
September, which will be payable in October. The Electric Union 
has announced that this measure will yield revenues of over 405 
million pesos annually or a monthly revenue average of 34 
million pesos. 
  Today's GRANMA features an article by Oria de la Cruz on 
page 
two, which offers extensive information on this issue.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon from the "Evening Information </F>
Review" newscast] 
  [Text] Today [1 June] marks the beginning of some price and 
fee increases agreed on by the Council of Ministers Executive 
Committee to cleanse the nation's domestic finances, which are 
being burdened by the circulation of a large amount of currency. 
  Surplus liquidity increased as the country found itself 
forced to reduce production and imports because of the 
termination of the fair and fruitful ties that had existed with 
the now dissolved socialist bloc. 
  The country's purchasing power was further reduced as a 
result of the tightening of the U.S. economic blockade. 
Eventually, supplies dwindled, and this led to Cuban workers 
who found that they held large amounts of money they could not 
spend. 
  Excess currency in circulation undermines the motivation to 
work and to produce, and it fuels the black market which 
benefits a group of citizens who dedicate themselves to 
profiting from the needs of the majority. 
  One way of collecting this excess money is by increasing 
prices on nonessential products and service fees, while making 
adjustments designed to protect certain sectors of the 
population. 
  In addition, the government will introduce these reforms 
gradually and will continuing subsidizing staples to the tune of 
365 million pesos a year. This helps the family economy a great 
deal. 
  Today's cigarette price hike affects 3 million smokers, but 
addicts as well as those who do not have this harmful habit will 
continue receiving a monthly quota at prices below the new 
price, but always higher than the current price. 
  Another reform that went into effect today has to do with 
new 
prices on liquor -- a category that rightly is considered 
nonessential. The impact of this price hike will not affect the 
entire population. 
  Today, 1 June, the fees for air and sea transportation to 
and 
from the Isle of Youth will also be increased, but the increases 
will be relatively modest. 
  With the implementation today of the new prices on 
cigarettes, liquor, and transportation to the Isle of Youth 
begins the first phase of a plan that will cover other 
nonessential products and services, although there will be some 
exceptions based on specific situations. These new prices and 
fees represent an increase in family expenditures, but everybody 
knows that the funds collected will be used to benefit society.

  [Text] Varadero is an ideal locale for tourism, but as a 
Cuban municipality, it is also involved in defense. A Cuban 
Revolutionary Navy [MGR] exercise was successfully held in this 
Matanzas Province municipality with the participation of tourism 
marina workers, who were grouped into special navy units. In 
peacetime, these units work to detect oil spills, illegal 
departures and landings, and drug trafficing, among other tasks. 
In wartime, they undertake specific tasks in support of regular 
MGR units and Border Guard troops, in close cooperation with 
ground and air troops. 
  The workers of the Aqua, Chapelin, and Gaviota marinas 
demonstrated the adroitness and readiness attained during 
different times of the exercise, which included a tactical 
scouting demonstration, the use of the Navy's firing range, and 
intercepting a target. Resources built with scarce materials and 
a lot of initiative were also presented. These resources help to 
increase the protection of Cuban shores against a possible enemy 
attack. Specialists from the five provinces comprising the 
Central Army were in attendance. 
  Varadero hopes to become the first municipality in Matanzas 
Province to attain the status of ready for defense in the second 
phase.

  [Text] After surpassing the sugarcane spring planting 
program in April, the Sugar Industry Ministry was behind 
schedule at the end of May. Preliminary data shows that 8,700 
caballerias have been planted; this represents a lag of over 
5,000 caballerias, according to May projections. The excessive, 
continuous rains in the eastern provinces and the ensuing floods 
are among the causes for the delay. We must keep in mind that 
the sugarcane planting program is of national significance in 
Camaguey, Holguin, Las Tunas, Granma, and Santiago de Cuba 
Provinces. It is expected that the lost time will be recovered 
in June through tremendous planting efforts. Everything will 
mainly depend, however, upon the amount of land prepared to 
receive the seed.

  [Text] Rum production projected for 1994 ensures a steady 
supply of ration quotas and the current levels of sales in the 
food stores. The Liquors and Beverages Union will produce 33 
million liters of rum in 1994, a volume slightly higher than in 
1993. This was announced by union director Jose Manuel de la 
Osa. The Sugar Industry Ministry and people's government 
productions will allow the supply to reach 41 million liters in 
1994. This does not mean, however, that rum sales can be 
deregulated, like what happened with cigarettes. The industry 
has the capacity to increase its volume of production, but does 
not have enough molasses and alcohols to satisfy the rum demand 
in the retail chain. De la Osa pointed out that increases in 
those essential raw materials will make it possible to increase 
rum production in the future. For the present, ration quotas per 
family unit, as well as the levels of distribution to the retail 
food chain, will continue in Havana and the rest of Cuba.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Jose Luis Garcia, deputy director </F>
in charge of economic affairs at the Cienfuegos Oil Refinery, by 
Barbara Betancur; place and date not given; from the "Evening 
Information Review" newscast] 
  [Text] Officials from the Cienfuegos Oil Refinery, a 
modern-technology plant that has been in operation since 1989, 
are currently engaged in negotiations with a Mexican enterprise. 
As in other Cuban industries, refinery officials are trying to 
find a partner with whom they can jointly operate the 
enterprise. This would lead to the securing of adequate amounts 
of crude oil, to stable production, and to a market for that 
production. This was confirmed to Radio Havana Cuba by Jose 
Luis Garcia, the refinery's deputy director in charge of 
economic affairs. 
  Garcia said the Mexican side, along with Cuba, would make 
investments needed to help the plant improve its efficiency. 
  [Begin recording] [Garcia] This is a primary refining plant. 
We need a secondary process -- in other words, heavy processing 
-- to guarantee higher percentages of clear derivatives which 
garner higher prices on the world market. This would make the 
plant more competitive. 
  [Betancur] On our way here, we noticed that smoke was coming 
out of the chimney. Obviously you are refining oil. I would 
like to know what kind of oil you are refining right now and how 
the operation is going. 
  [Garcia] Right now, during the first four months of the 
year, 
we have had fairly stable refining of crude oil and a stable 
yield of oil byproducts for national use. 
  [Betancur] When you say crude oil, you are not talking about 
national crude oil, but about the crude oil we import, right? 
Do you refine Cuban crude oil here also? 
  [Garcia] So far we have been refining imported crude oil, 
not 
national crude oil. 
  [Betancur] How many derivatives can this refinery produce? 
  [Garcia] We have the ability to produce 3 million tons of 
refined fuel annually. We also produce the following 
derivatives: GLP, or normal liquid gas; naphtha; regular and 
premium gasoline; kerosene; diesel; and fuel oil. These are the 
derivatives. We also can produce elemental sulfur in our sulfur 
plant. 
  [Betancur] I understand you have two oil pipelines. What are 
these for? 
  [Garcia] At this plant we have two oil pipelines. One 
guarantees the stability of crude oil supplies from the Matanzas 
supertanker station. This is a 182 km-long pipeline. This 
pipeline links us to the port of Matanzas, a supertanker port, a 
port for deep-draft ships. We also receive crude oil at our 
docks. This is the oil we are using right now. 
  [Betancur] But this does not get here through an oil 
pipeline, does it? This is brought here from the local docks. 
  [Garcia] The other pipeline we have is for moving fuel oil 
to 
the Thermoelectric Central Plant next to our enterprise. 
  [Betancur] The smaller pipeline is for taking refined 
products to the Cienfuegos Thermoelectric Central Plant? 
  [Garcia] That is right. This pipeline was built to reduce 
fuel transportation costs from here to the Thermoelectric 
Central Plant. 
  [Betancur] How much savings does this pipeline represents? 
  [Garcia] More than $2 million annually because of the 
reduction in transportation costs and in the time ships spend 
unloading the product. It also contributes to protect the bay. 
We have a clean bay. This is possible because we have a very 
efficient plant for processing residuals. It keeps petroleum 
residuals at internationally acceptable levels. [end recording] 
  I want to report that in addition to the oil pipeline and 
the 
plant for treating residuals, the Cienfuegos Oil Refinery hosts 
the country's largest chimney, which is 192 meters tall -- tall

    [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 
at 1600 GMT on 2 June features the "Straight Talk" Program with 
host Osvaldo Rodriguez from BOHEMIA magazine and guest Renato 
Recio from TRABAJADORES newspaper. 
  Rodriguez begins by asking: "Currently, what is being 
implemented? Is it or is it not a package of measures?" Recio 
explains that reporters have been using the term, "group of 
measures," rather than "package of measures," noting that the 
Miami EL NUEVO HERALD said that the measures being implemented 
in Cuba have a neoliberal character. 
  Recio asks: "Why avoid using the phrase, package of 
measures, 
even if we are talking about a significant group of measures? I 
believe the reason is precisely to avoid giving the impression 
that the measures respond to neoliberal policies. The phrase, 
package of measures, has always been associated with the 
neoliberal formula which, as we all know, is implemented 
overnight, even without cabinet-level discussions, but rather, 
by two or three influential people in the government, with 
premeditation, and under cover of night." 
  Rodriguez explains that it is more than just a matter of 
semantics; it is a matter of concepts. Recio adds that measures 
to correct economic problems are necessarily similar, no matter 
in what country they are taken, but that: "Cuba does not want to 
become a market economy." 
  Recio observes that despite the similarity of the measures 
being taken in Cuba with those abroad, the difference lies in 
the goal of the measures. Rodriguez and Recio discuss aspects of 
market-economy measures, but emphasize that in Cuba, the 
measures were preceded by extensive consultation with the 
people. Recio continues: "In Cuba, economic reforms respond to 
the social base from which the political power of the Revolution 
emanates -- the workers, farmers, the people in general. This is 
why we do not have a struggle among social classes in Cuba." 
Recio adds that the issue is not what the measures are called, 
but what they seek to accomplish, and advises avoidance of the 
term, package of measures, because of the term's connotations. 
  Regarding the way the people have received the measures and 
the increased sacrifice that they entail, Rodriguez states: "I 
believe the initial reaction has not been very positive among 
the people in general because I do not believe the measures have 
been explained very well." 
  Recio calls on the media to further explain the measures to 
the people, explaining: "If these measures truly serve to 
increase production and food supplies, you will eventually 
increase your food intake and solve a number of current 
shortages. If we are to understand these measures as a 
sacrifice, we must see them as a welcome sacrifice because they 
will yield the results we seek." Rodriguez agrees that the 
sacrifices are obvious. 
  Recio closes with the statment: "As excess currency 
diminishes, black market prices will do so as well."

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina </F>
in Cairo, Egypt, by Roberto Gili in Havana -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Gili] We would like to know what the Cuban 
delegation to the Ibero-American Summit -- to be held on 14-15 
June in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia -- expects to achieve. 
  [Robaina] These summits continue to be special occasions 
when 
we can meet without being ordered to do so by the Empire. The 
Ibero-American Summit, specifically, is already threatened by 
the Miami hemispheric summit, convened by the U.S. Government 
for the clear purpose of discrediting it. I believe that in 
light of such a maneuver, it is important for the Cartagena 
summit to be stronger than ever in terms of its development. 
  I have no doubt that, independent of their efforts, the 
Latin 
American peoples are increasingly more independent and will 
continue to find their own path. We need to see how the rest of 
America responds, but I have confidence in Colombia's readiness 
and the peoples' response. I believe this will be an important 
forum for discussion and that Colombia would like it to become a 
stage for debate, discussion, and unrehearsed speeches. I hope 
it will be a summit for action rather than intentions. 
  [Gili] Thank you minister.

  [Text] Havana, 1 Jun (EFE) -- Today, Brazilian diplomatic 
sources informed EFE that the Cuban Government has sold Brazil a 
package of more than 50 pharmaceutical products -- to be 
delivered by the end of June -- for $30 million. 
  As part of an accord signed earlier this year, the agreement 
has three purposes: 1) to amortize the Cuban debt with official 
Brazilian entities, 2) to make a cash payment, and 3) to 
purchase Brazilian products. According to sources, the first 
delivery of medicines was completed in mid-May. 
  Via this transaction, Brazil hopes to receive approximately 
$3 million to cover the debts, the greater part of which are 
lines of credit from official banks for exporting products from 
Brazil to Cuba. Brazilian imports from Cuba traditionally 
include about 25 products, including soybeans, poultry, engines, 
tires, and polyethylene. 
  Cuba began delaying paying its Brazilian debt in 1989 during 
the process 
process that brought about the disappearance of the Soviet 
Union, which had been Cuba's leading trading partner and top 
supplier of commodities and spare parts. 
  In 1933, Brazilian exports to Cuba reached $9 million and 
imports from Cuba $21 million. To reactivate trade with Brazil, 
Cuban officials have offered $300 million in products, mainly 
medicines.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 2 Jun (EFE) -- Today, the "de facto" 
government presided over by Judge Emile Jonassaint denied it has 
frozen some $800,000 the executive branch of Prime Minister 
Robert Malval has in the Central Bank. This money was donated 
by AID. 
  "These are rumors," the government indicated in a communique 
released to the media by "de facto" Economy Minister Rigaud 
Duplan. Duplan said the decision to freeze the funds had been 
made by AID officials. 
  Duplan maintained that only this organization has the right 
to authorize the opening and closing of state checking accounts. 
[sentence as received] 
  "The government's measure to freeze all accounts is not 
directly related to any program to finance humanitarian aid," 
Duplan explained. 
  He added that on 27 May, AID asked the person in charge of 
the "PL-480" program, which is responsible for regulating food 
assistance, to freeze all operations and withdraw money from the 
account in the Central Bank. Despite this request, the Central 
Bank refused to hand the money over to the government of 
constitutional Prime Minister Robert Malval and to AID when it 
wrote a check to recover the funds and transfer them to another 
bank. 
  A Central Bank source said the people in charge of the 
institution acted in accordance with a decision of the Economy 
Ministry to "freeze" the use of funds to the Malval government, 
adding that they were not forced to do so by the Army. The 
money in the account comes from the sale of food donated by AID 
to the Malval government to finance humanitarian aid for the 
poorest sectors of the population. 
  The constitutional government has not yet reacted to this 
decision by the "de facto" government, which wants to use this 
money to finance "its social programs."

  [Text] Mexico City, May 31 (AFP) -- Mario Ruiz, the deputy 
attorney general of the Republic, stated this Tuesday, that drug 
trafficking in Mexico is controlled by four large groups that 
have "all the economic and technological resources to conduct 
their activities." 
  In an interview given to the Monitor newscast, the official 
admitted that the powerful Mexican traffickers have a 
"corruption mattress" among the police and they also have "ties 
with international capos." 
  The Mexican capos are the Arellano Felix brothers of the 
Tijuana cartel, Hector Palma of the Sinaloa cartel, Juan Garcia 
Abrego of the Tamaulipas cartel, and Amado Cardillo of the 
Juarez cartel, the deputy attorney general stated. 
  Ruiz, who recently gave Federal Judicial Police [PJF] 
members 
a one-month ultimatum to arrest the drug chieftains, said the 
Attorney General's Office (PGR) is attempting to break the 
intermediate structures of the banks. He pointed out that until 
the capos are arrested, the authorities will attempt to 
interrupt the flow of money and drugs to the cartel chieftains. 
  The deputy attorney general said getting to the capos is 
very 
difficult as they have a "corruption mattress" as well as "all 
the economic and technological resources to move about and even 
to leave the country and return. It is, thus, very difficult to 
search for them." He added, however, "when we arrest 
intermediate drug traffickers, they will give us information 
that will allow us to achieve bigger objectives." 
  Ruiz admitted the struggle against drug trafficking is an 
endless war, but as long as the institutions and the PGR 
continue to battle they will be able to control the situation 
and, in principle, stop drug-trafficking activities from growing. 
  Last weekend, Ruiz demanded that the PJF in charge of the 
fight against drug traffickers arrest the drug chieftains. Ruiz 
said that if the PJF does not make arrests, they will be charged 
with negligence or complicity and they will be subjected to 
justice. He explained there is evidence tying policemen with 
organized crime but he asserted that most of the PJF members are 
honest. He said the PGR is determined to get results, such as a 
large quantity of drugs seized and the arrest of more drug 
traffickers.

<F P=106> [Article by Luis Acevedo and Marcos Chavez] </F>
  [Text] Government optimism based on a modest increase in 
the gross national product [GNP] in the first quarter of 1994 
offers cosmetic economic growth with the apparent intent of not 
impeding electoral goals. Nevertheless, facts indicate serious 
signs of deterioration in production investment, domestic sales, 
the inability to generate jobs, and a growing deficit in the 
foreign sector. 
  According to the SHCP [Secretariat of Finance and Public 
Credit], Banco de Mexico, INEGI [National Institute of 
Geography, Statistics, and Data], IMSS [Mexican Social Security 
Institute], and various private organizations, 130,000 paying 
jobs were lost between January and March. The development of 
various productive sectors is still heterogeneous, with an 
average unemployment rate of 70 percent. The trade balance 
deficit grew 18 percent, and businesses in general are facing 
heavy financial burdens resulting from an increase in interest 
rates. 
  The following sectors, which collectively contribute 68 
percent of the GNP in manufacturing, have remained in recession: 
food production, the textiles industry, lumber, printing, 
chemical production, and the nonmetallic minerals production. 
  As if this were not enough, prevailing conditions are not 
ripe for a 5-percent inflation target by year's end, even though 
consumer prices have been the lowest in a long time. Up until 
the first half of May, 58 percent of the overall inflation goal 
had already been attained. 
  Nevertheless, there is an assurance a firm monetary 
management will prevent the transition of public administration 
from incurring serious problems as in the past, particularly 
because no presidential candidate has advocated a modification 
of the structural indicators of the economic strategy. 
  The 0.5-percent growth in the GNP between January and March 
does not guarantee the economy can overcome the prevailing 
recession or that it can reinitiate a sustained growth that 
could dampen any electoral expectation. Financial authorities 
have presented this position as a departure from the poor 
performance during the last quarter of 1993. 
  There are signs suggesting the hoped-for economic 
reactivation possibly ran out of steam during the second 
quarter, and with great difficulty it could progress by more 
than one half of a percentage point. Under the best of 
circumstances, economic growth could be 1 percent during 1994. 
  During most of the first quarter of the year, mild economic 
conditions prevailed, reflecting the overall results of official 
statistics, but that does not demonstrate the economy's real 
condition. 
  Up until the end of March, inflation and interest rates were 
low; the exchange rate remained below the limit of the top 
floating ceiling; domestic and foreign demand was slightly 
reactivated, and the domino effect resulting from the increase 
in public spending boosted several economic sectors. Moreover, 
investment recovered in January. 
  This is why the sectors that demonstrated the best 
performance were geared toward countries abroad while 
traditional economic activities are still in a recession or a 
structural crisis. 
  As analysts of the TENDENCIAS ECONOMICAS Y FINANCIERAS have 
indicated, the economic setback resulting from the 
sociopolitical situation at the end of March will be felt during 
the second quarter of the year, despite definite stability in 
the financial and exchange markets. 
  The peso already suffered a 6-percent devaluation with 
regard 
to the dollar in May. 
  The transfer of foreign capital passed from Treasury 
Certificates to Treasury Bonds. The flight of capital was 
checked, but it also revealed a mistrust in the exchange rate. 
The cost of credits rose almost 100 percent, and domestic and 
foreign investments were reduced. 
  Many companies are suffering from a loss in demand and 
revenues due to the high cost of financing and losses in the 
exchange rate. 
  The economic expectations for the third and fourth quarters 
are no better. Pre- and post electoral uncertainty could hinder 
the hoped-for economic recovery. 
  Despite minor growth, the trade deficit accumulated a 
balance 
of $4.29 billion between January and March, 18.9 percent higher 
than the same period in 1993 when the economy expanded 2.4 
percent. At this pace, the trade imbalance could close at the 
end of the year at approximately $16 billion. 
  The SHCP, as stated in its Report on the Public Economic and 
Financial Situation, maintains that since November, "there have 
been continued signs coinciding with the first phase of the 
expansive stage in the economic cycles," meaning "we are on the 
right road, headed for the" programmed "goals." 
  Official optimism is based on low prices and a 0.5-percent 
increase in the GNP, supported by an improvement in certain 
activities. This is particularly true of those activities 
oriented toward countries abroad and the construction industry, 
as well as the appropriate management of public finances, among 
other factors. 
  Nevertheless, the private sector no longer presents carefree 
accounts. For Banamex [National Bank of Mexico], recovery is 
not clear, while there are factors that could delay and limit 
it. Investment projects could be postponed. Low consumption 
could lead to an increase in inventories and a decrease in 
production. 
  Meanwhile, Bancomer [Bank of Commerce] has adjusted its GNP 
forecast to 1.8 percent with a 7.5-percent inflation rate. 
Bancomer believes growth will be tangible toward the third 
quarter, as long as economic stability and political assurance 
prevail. 
  For the stock company Vector, coinciding with the stock 
company Probursa and with the Industrial Promotion Office, the 
panorama is not as favorable as it was in November. These 
investment firms suggest businesses plan strategies for the 
short and long term. 
  For the investment company InverMexico, "political 
uncertainty, high interest rates, and the exchange rate will 
most likely influence a new slowdown in investment, productive 
activity, and consumption." Thus, slow growth is expected for 
the first six months and up to the fourth quarter when 
reactivation is confirmed. The annual GNP is presently 1.5 
percent, half of what was originally forecast. Meanwhile, 
TENDENCIAS ECONOMICAS Y FINANCIERAS forecasts a 1-percent GNP. 
INEGI and Bank of Mexico data justify a cautious position. 
  Except for public and investment accounts, which increased 
5.2 percent in January, supported by factors of the construction 
sector, equipment, and imported machinery, other indicators have 
deviated from their goals. 
  Despite slow growth in domestic demand (consumption and 
investment), accumulated inflation has deviated from its fixed 
goal. 
  Prices in May were recorded at 2.84 percent as opposed to a 
2.1-percent variation required to attain an annual rate of 5 
percent, indicative of a 56.8-percent increase and not the 42 
percent required to close the year with a 5-percent rate. 
Inflationary deviation will be no greater than the established 
target thanks to its effect on money expenditures, investment, 
and production. 
  The modest improvement in the GNP during the first quarter, 
much lower than the growth in population, cannot be considered 
as too encouraging, given it is highly uneven, unsuitable to 
encourage more employment, and spurred by a growing trade 
deficit. 
  Growth was observed only in the transportation and financial 
sectors, as well as in other activities such as mining, 
construction, electricity, basic metals, machinery and 
equipment, manufacturing, and assembly plant industries. 
  In February, there was a slight drop in annual accumulated 
production in the mining, construction, electricity, assembly 
plants, machinery, and other manufacturing sectors. 
  A recession continued in the food, textiles, lumber, 
printing, chemicals and nonmetallic mining industries, which 
contribute nearly 68 percent to GNP manufacturing. 
  Average unemployment in the manufacturing industry dropped 
significantly during the first quarter: 27.1 percent as opposed 
to 27.6 percent during the same period in 1993. 
  Recovery in this sector was accompanied by a drop in 
employment in activities such as wholesale trade, assembly plant 
industries, and manufacturing. 
  Thus, IMSS beneficiaries dropped 1.3 percent and the average 
unemployment rate during the month of March increased to 3.8 
percent. Nearly 81,370 jobs were lost in the construction 
sector between December 1993 and February 1994. 
  The drop in sales could become a serious obstacle to 
production. On average, wholesale activity fell 1.2 percent, 
while retail fell 5.9 percent. This drop in demand affects 
mostly activities such as food, textiles, paper and pulp, 
petrochemicals, and others.

<F P=106> [From the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>
  [Text] On Monday night, Carlos Almada, director of the 
Federal Voter Registry [Registro Federal de Electores -- RFE] 
and Samuel del Villar, representative of the PRD [Party of the 
Democratic Revolution] to the Federal Electoral Institute [IFE], 
held a 45-minute debate on the electoral registry. The central 
topic of debate was the mechanisms used to certify the 
trustworthiness of the electoral registry. Here is a report by 
Francisco Rubio: 
  [Begin recording] [Rubio] On one side was a PRD alternate 
representative, who aggressively made charges of alleged 
irregularities in the electoral registry, and on the other side 
was the RFE executive director, who one by one rebutted the 
attacks with answers backed by the figures that have already 
been released to the public. Samuel del Villar, alternate PRD 
representative to the IFE, said the irregularities detected by 
the PRD members in the electoral registry are the result of the 
connection between the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party], 
IFE, and Salinas de Gortari. 
  [Del Villar] We began by confirming the Salinas-PRI-IFE-RFE 
connection with regard to the authority to grant voting cards 
and to make registrations in the list of voters. 
  [Rubio] The response was not long in coming. Regarding 
charges about close links between former IFE officials and now 
state authorities, RFE Executive Director Carlos Almada said 
personal biographies were not the issue. 
  [Almada] I categorically reject the conclusions and the 
analyses of Dr. del Villar this evening. They simply do not 
coincide with reality. 
  [Rubio] Amid countless technical explanations that diverted 
viewers' attention for several moments, Carlos Almada reiterated 
that of the 50 million Mexicans [eligible to vote], 47 million 
are registered in the electoral registry. He said 44 million 
have voting cards that have their photographs. Therefore, they 
will appear in the voters' list. In other words, 95 percent of 
Mexicans [eligible to vote] can cast their vote. He ruled out 
that there are ghost voters. 
  [Almada] The ghosts are of flesh and blood. We find them in 
Tabasco. We find them in the Federal District. We can go see 
them whenever you want. 
  [Rubio] Nevertheless, there was no clear explanation by the 
RFE executive director about the high cost of the external audit 
of the electoral register by eight private companies, one of 
them the Mackinsey firm which, according to Samuel del Villar, 
is also linked to the PRI. 
  [Almada] As for the sum for Mackinsey, the accountants will 
see to it and will resolve it. 
  [Rubio] During the televised debate between Samuel del 
Villar 
and Carlos Almada, there were no winners or losers, only a 
society more informed about the environment that will prevail 
during the 21 August elections. [end recording]

he has been saying all along: he will not participate in the 
debate among all the presidential candidates. On 28 and 29 May, 
he said the following: 
  [Begin Fernandez recording] I believe that if there is time 
for multiple debates, it makes no sense for all of us to meet on 
the same day and at the same time, especially when the objective 
of the debate has already been expressed. I repeat, I think 
there is enough time; it makes no sense for us to meet at the 
same time and place. [end recording]

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the elections scheduled for 
21 August. 
  While visiting two towns in Chiapas State, Rafael Aguilar 
Talamantes, presidential candidate for the Cardenist Front for 
National Reconstruction Party, cited his party's support for 
farm occupations and takeovers. He said "we must discuss each 
case and hold talks to correct any abuses, even those committed 
on our side." (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 
0430 GMT 27 May 94) 
  During his second day in Chiapas State, candidate Aguilar 
Talamantes told the residents of Guitiapan the "method of 
struggle Subcommander Marcos and the Zapatists use cannot work 
or effect good results; we know that." (Mexico City XEW 
Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 28 May 94) 
  PRD candidate Cardenas has visited Mesa de Alcoyotic, Mexico 
State, and commented on the announcement the PRD (Party of the 
Democratic Revolution) and PAN (National Action Party) had 
established a pact of nonaggression: "We do not sign pacts. We 
will behave respectably and adhere to PRD principles and respond 
how we must." He also expressed support for the idea of more 
debates with the other presidential candidates. (Mexico City XEW 
Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 27 May 94) 
  Commenting on an invitation from PRI (Institutional 
Revolutionary Party) candidate Zedillo to the other presidential 
candidates to hold a debate, PRD candidate Cardenas has asked 
the other candidates to agree on "this next debate, as well as 
on the others we may hold up to 21 August." He also proposed 
holding debates between two candidates. Cardenas has also said 
the news media, Televisa, Television Azteca, and Multivision in 
particular, should give all the candidates the opportunity to 
comment on the debates after they are over. (Mexico City XEW 
Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 28 May 94) 
  In Guerrero State, PAN candidate Fernandez has said he 
disagreed with Zedillo's proposal to hold a debate with all the 
presidential candidates. He did not rule out the idea, however, 
saying he supported "finding mechanisms and reasonable formulas 
to continue the debates." The debates, he said, should not be an 
"ambush to stop PAN's struggle in winning the Presidency." The 
PAN candidate also endorsed a final revision of the electoral 
lists with the participation of all the political parties. 
(Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 27 May 
94) 
  At the conclusion of a meeting with businessmen from the 
southern area of the Federal District, candidate Fernandez 
announced his party and the PRD have established a "pact of 
nonaggression" in order to end mutual accusations. During his 
meeting with the businessmen, he pledged to amend the Federal 
Labor Law, without "hurting the gains of the workers," and to 
implement a "social market economy based on freedom and private 
initiative." (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 26 May 94 p12) 
  Talking to tourism students at the San Angel Higher Studies 
Center, Mexican Green Ecologist Party presidential candidate 
Jorge Gonzalez described as "totally undemocratic" candidate 
Fernandez' rejection of a debate with all the presidential 
candidates. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 
GMT 28 May 94) 
  At the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Marcela Lombardo, 
presidential 
candidate of the Popular Socialist Party, has told reporters she 
accepts Zedillo's invitation to participate in a debate. 
(Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 28 May 
94) 
  Pablo Emilio Madero, presidential candidate of the National 
Opposition Union (UNO), began a visit to Guanajuato State that 
will take him to 14 municipalities. He met with his supporters 
at Dolores Hidalgo Square where he said "peace and tranquility 
should not be the lack of armed violence only; there should be 
peace and tranquility because the votes are respected." (Mexico 
City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 27 May 94) 
  If elected, "I will make the tax burden more equitable," 
candidate Madero told his supporters at Juventino Rosas during 
his second day of campaigning in Guanajuato. (Mexico City XEW 
Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 28 May 94) 
  Speaking to party supporters, PRI national leader Ignacio 
Pichardo Pagaza has said the PRI trusts it will win in at least 
40 districts of Mexico City. He said the Mexican revolution 
will be maintained until the turn of the century with "the 
majority vote of the Mexican people." He spoke after swearing in 
Fernando Lerdo de Tejada and Juan Carlos Sanchez Magallan as PRI 
president and secretary general, respectively, of the Federal 
District. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 1 Jun 94 p 9) 
  During her first day of campaigning in Chiapas State, Labor 
Party (PT) presidential candidate Cecilia Soto Gonzalez agreed 
to hold a debate with the other eight presidential candidates 
and proposed it be held on 1 June. (Mexico City XEW Television 
Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 27 May 94) 
  While in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas State, Soto 
said 
the peace process is not advancing, because "the state and 
federal governments lack a sufficient commitment to resolve the 
problem of landownership and land reform." (Mexico City XEW 
Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 28 May 94) 
  In Mexico State, Jorge Gonzalez Torres, Mexican Green 
Ecologist Party presidential candidate, has said Article 27 of 
the Constitution had to be amended back to the way it was 
originally drafted in order for the 21 August elections to be 
credible and honest. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in 
Spanish 0430 GMT 27 May 94) 
  Today, Alvaro Perez Trevino, presidential candidate of the 
Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution, said Ernesto Zedillo 
is the country's best option. He reiterated what he said a 
month ago in the studios of Radio Acir. Trevino said if he does 
not win the elections, he will support Zedillo. He has said his 
party is not a parastate party or a satellite of the PRI. 
(Mexico City Radio Acir Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 1 Jun 94) 
  During a ceremony at PRI headquarters, candidate Zedillo 
spoke in favor of maintaining a "healthy distance" between the 
government and PRI. Zedillo has said: "We want a nation of 
welfare, opportunities, and a firm hope," saying poverty in 
Mexico does not admit "indifference or evasion." Zedillo has 
said his efforts will be directed at increasing the people's 
security and property, eliminating impunity, and fighting 
narcotrafficking. Zedillo has recognized the merits of 
President Carlos, saying he has left the PRI government a legacy 
of patriotism and undaunted determination. (Mexico City EL 
FINANCIERO in Spanish 30 May 94 p 6) 
  As instructed by Zedillo, the PRI has sent representatives 
to 
Japan, the United States, South America, Spain, and Portugal to 
brief the country representatives on the electoral process that 
will take place in Mexico in August, Jose Angel Gurria has 
announced. They will strive to guarantee the elections in Mexico 
will be clean so that foreign investors will not lose confidence 
in Mexico. (Monterrey EL NORTE (Foreign Edition) in Spanish 30 
May 94 p 4A) 
  During a meeting with reporters in Saltillo, Cahuila State, 
Zedillo has said that so far none of the presidential candidates 
has formally replied to his proposal to hold a debate. He said 
he hoped all the candidates would agree to participate. He 
described the disappointment among PRI members regarding the 
selection of candidates as normal, adding the PRI "has again 
shown its strength, unity, and will continue to strive to win 
democratically." (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 
0430 GMT 27 May 94) 
  Zedillo has flown to Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua State, and 
visited an assembly plant. He has promised to sustain sources 
of employment but, rather, "under decent conditions" for 
workers. During a meeting with local businessmen, he heard of 
their views on the bad economic situation, the crime wave, and 
drug trafficking. "We are going to reform our country's 
apparatus of justice," he said. Zedillo also met privately with 
PAN Governor Francisco Barrio. If elected, the PRI candidate 
affirmed, he will maintain close cooperation with local 
governments ruled by opposition parties. (Mexico City XEW 
Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 27 May 94) 
  Zedillo has expressed reservations about signing several 
points of the Agreement for Democracy. He asked for a four-week 
period to present suggestions to the commission sponsoring the 
agreement. Zedillo has said the idea behind the agreement is 
good but that the agenda must be broader on judicial matters and 
on the division of power. So far, only PAN candidate Diego 
Fernandez, PRD candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, and PT candidate 
Cecilia Soto have signed the agreement. (Monterrey EL NORTE 
(Foreign Edition) in Spanish 31 May 94 p 1A)

<F P=106> [Report by Enrique Mora] </F>
  [Text] San Jose, 1 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Costa Rican President 
Jose Maria Figueres said that because of world changes, the 
collapse of ideological barriers, and the end of the Cold War, 
Costa Rica believes that it should review its policy toward Cuba. 
  Figueres, in statements to NOTIMEX, said he considers "this 
review of the Cuban case should be done by all the hemisphere's 
countries, to find a peaceful solution to the island's 
situation." 
  It is not a question of establishing relations in the near 
future. It is a question that relations with that country 
should take on a new, broader outlook, more in accordance with 
the international situation, Figueres said. 
  The president has repeatedly said that the solution to the 
Cuban problem should be dealt with through negotiations at the 
hemispheric level, to avoid bloodshed in Cuba. 
  The government of former President Rafael Angel Calderon 
Fournier (1990 to May 1994) on several occasions spoke of the 
need to resolve Cuba's integration into the inter-American 
system through dialogue, in order to avoid bloodshed. 
  During the last UN General Assembly, Costa Rica voted with 
the majority of countries against the U.S. blockade of Cuba. 
  Costa Rica considers the U.S.-imposed blockade of Cuba a 
violation of international law contrary to the spirit of free 
trade, which the United States promised to respect through the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  On this same topic, Foreign Affairs Minister Fernando 
Naranjo, underscored that "today Cuba lives under an oppressive 
political and economic situation, in which the people are the 
ones who suffer." 
  "The Cuban people deserve a better future, and it is Latin 
America's obligation to raise its voice in defense of democracy, 
sovereignty, and liberties for the entire hemisphere," Naranjo 
explained. 
  The foreign minister clarified that "Costa Rica is not 
willing to support actions that condemn a people to hunger, 
poverty, and oppression, because respect of all human rights is 
part and parcel of being Costa Rican." 
  Naranjo pointed out to N0TIMEX that "Cuba's delicate 
situation should be analyzed in depth by all countries in the 
hemisphere because of international changes that have taken 
place," such as the end of the East-West conflict and the end of 
the Cold War. 
  "If Costa Rica is able to contribute anything, if Costa Rica 
can add its grain of sand to find a solution to Cuba's crisis, 
we are willing to play that role, because passivity is the worst 
mistake at this moment," Naranjo stressed. 
  The foreign minister said that "hopefully all Costa Ricans 
will join together to encourage a hemispheric position in the 
case of Cuba, and this is in full agreement with the democratic 
principles the American continent today brandishes with pride."

  [Text] San Jose, 2 Jun (AFP) -- Today, the local media 
reported that Costa Rican Foreign Minister Fernando Naranjo 
categorically rejected an eventual resumption of diplomatic 
relations between Costa Rica and Cuba, although he stressed his 
country "will voice the concerns" of the island within the OAS. 
  "Neither the president of the Republic, the foreign 
minister, 
nor the country has considered resuming diplomatic relations 
with the government of Fidel Castro," Naranjo told the Costa 
Rican newspaper LA NACION, while clarifying his government's 
position on Cuba. 
  The Costa Rican Government has referred to the need to 
reconsider the "Cuban case" within the OAS, from which Cuba was 
suspended more than 30 years ago after the installation of a 
military regime in Cuba. 
  According to the foreign minister, the government will push 
for an in-depth analysis of the Cuban crisis by the nations of 
the hemisphere, because "Cuba is currently facing an oppressive 
political and economic situation." 
  "We are not going to become spokesmen for the regime of 
Fidel 
Castro, because we cannot agree with a government that does not 
respect human rights," Naranjo reiterated to the domestic media. 
He also stressed that the OAS "will have to heed the voice of 
the Cuban people." 
  Naranjo is trying to thwart criticism from the opposition, 
which has claimed that the government's position is the result 
of "improvisation" because no changes have taken place in Cuba 
to justify a shift in Costa Rica's policy toward the island. 
  Costa Rican President Jose Maria Figueres, who assumed power 
on 8 May, has stated that changes in the international situation 
demand a revision of Costa Rica's policy toward Cuba to "advance 
the principles of human rights and democracy."

  [Text] Army spokeswoman Edith Vargas de Marroquin has 
blamed the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) for 
last night's bomb attacks against a shopping mall and the 
residence of Fernando Quezada Toruno. 
  The Army spokeswoman has said the guerrillas are the only 
ones capable of placing such bombs, which endanger the lives of 
the people, as what happened the night of 31 May when they 
exploded in the urban sector. 
  The explosions caused damage to Climat, a boutique located 
at 
No. 13-70 7th Avenue, Zone 9, and the residence of lawyer 
Fernando Quezada Toruno, the brother of Monsignor Rodolfo 
Quezada Toruno, president of the Civil Sectors Assembly. 
  The URNG could be responsible for the two bombs at the two 
locations, Government Minister Danilo Parrinello Blanco said 
yesterday. 
  We knew of a terrorist escalation, but we cannot ascertain 
the guerrillas are responsible for the bomb explosions, 
although, by logic, we can surmise they did it, the minister 
said. 
  There is no other reason to think this was an action by 
another group, but the investigations under way will confirm it, 
Parrinello Blanco concluded.

  [Text] According to a political statement issued in Mexico, 
the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) general 
command charged last night, that President Ramiro de Leon Carpio 
and the top National Army commanders are the ones most 
interested in blocking the negotiations to achieve peace in 
Guatemala. 
  The guerrilla bases its charges on three fundamental points 
which are included in the statement sent to our offices. The 
statement says the Guatemalan Government's Peace Commission is 
"strong and untruthful" and describes it as: 
  1. "Deceitful, because it has attempted to describe its 
position as humanitarian. However, it has ignored the most 
salient aspects of the displaced people's plight -- the 
magnitude of the problem and the social trauma it causes -- and 
reduced it to the ridiculous, insignificant, and precarious 
government policy it has started to implement." 
  2. "Incoherent, because it rejects the calls of society and 
the demands of justice on this important issue as expressed both 
by the Civilian Society Assembly and the URNG at the 
negotiations table." 
  3. "Obstructionist, because it places conditions, such as a 
cease-fire in the area assigned to the returning displaced 
people, when this is totally out of place," the rebel 
organization statement asserts. 
  Regarding the last point, the URNG stated that the 
cease-fire 
condition does not correspond to the issue or to the validity of 
the agreement. It explained that the resettlement areas are not 
combat zones and added that "faithful compliance with the Global 
Agreement on Human Rights and its immediate verification include 
and guarantee the situation of the civilian population who are 
not combatants." 
  The URNG also charged that the National Army started an 
offensive in the Ixcan zone yesterday. According to the 
document, the Army has concentrated six elite troops, including 
paratroopers and battalions with orders to act against the 
Communities of Resistant People (CPR.) 
  The URNG demanded that the government end its national 
campaign on the development of the negotiations as it considered 
the campaign should present the situation to Guatemalan society 
in an impartial manner and with a political will to end the 
conflict. 
  Also, the URNG pointed out that there is no excuse for 
evading the commitment to negotiate, on the scheduled dates, the 
issues related to the integration of a commission to investigate 
human rights violations, without ending the discussions on the 
displaced population, as stipulated by the 29 March declaration 
when the Global Agreement on Human Rights was signed.

Representatives of Guatemalan Refugees in Mexico (Comisiones 
Permanentes de Representatives de Refugiados Guatemaltecos en 
Mexico--CCPP) issued in May 1994 in Guatemala City] 
  [Text] The CCPP, in view of the government's 
noncompliance with the agreements signed on 8 October 1992, 
which permit the voluntary and dignified return of our brothers, 
would like to inform national and international public opinion: 
  First: 
  That we announce the return of our brother refugees from 
Mexico to the farm La Quetzal, La Libertad Muncipality, Peten 
Department, will take place on 27 June, according to the 
government and CCPP agreement. 
  In view of the government's lack of respect and 
irresponsibility in connection with the signed agreements, we 
hold the government responsible for any attack or incident 
against the personal safety of those returning as well as 
against those who offer their solidarity by accompanying them. 
  Second: 
  That the CCPP, always respecting what has been agreed, 
presented to the CEAR [Special Commission for Assistance to 
Repatriated People] on 14 April a plan of operation for the 
return of the refugees, thus complying with the agreements in 
which it is stated the refugees may return 60 days after the 
plan is presented, meaning in our case the return to Guatemala 
can legally take place after 15 June. 
  Third: 
  That one of the seven agreements dated 8 October establishes 
that the refugees may decide how, when, and where they will 
return. We have decided to return to El Peten, specifically to 
the farm "La Quetzal," which is private property, and an 
agreement has already been reached for its purchase from current 
owners. 
  To this avail CONAP [National Council for Publicity] has 
issued an opinion that at least 20 percent of this farm may be 
used for settling. Nevertheless, afterward, and to block our 
return, CONAP contradicted itself and has said it is illegal to 
settle in "El Quetzal," because it is a part of the Maya 
Environ. CONAP has always opposed our return, despite the fact 
they and several institutions have made studies indicating only 
80 percent of the farm lies within the environ and the number of 
families that will settle will not endanger forest conservation 
or the environment. 
  Fourth: 
  We call on the national and international community to speak 
up regarding this situation and demand the Guatemalan Government 
comply with the agreements signed on 8 October 1992, without 
further delays or pretexts. 
  Fifth: 
  We ask the verification board to issue the report requested 
on 24 March 1994. 
  Sixth: 
  Last, we summon the accompanying forum [foro de 
acompanamiento] to establish a permanent assembly to accompany 
the movement's return to El Peten, which, we repeat, will take 
place on 27 June. 
  [Issued] Guatemala City 
  [Dated] May 1994. 
  The return is a right of all Guatemalans, and it is 
essential 
to the national process of reconciliation. 
  Return is struggle, not resignation

<F P=106> [By Huang Kwang-chun, Lo Kwang-jen and Sofia Wu] </F>
  [Text] Guatemala City, June 2 (CNA) -- Premier Lien Chan, 
heading a 21-member entourage, arrived in Guatemala Thursday [2 
June] evening from El Salvador for a four-day official visit. 
  Lien was greeted by Guatemalan Vice President Arturo 
Herbruger Asturias and other senior Guatemalan officials at the 
airport. 
  Herbruger said in his welcoming speech that Lien's visit 
symbolizes strong ties between the Republic of China [ROC] and 
Guatemala. 
  Lien said he appreciates the hospitality the Guatemalan 
Government has extended to him and his entourage. "I hope 
cooperation between our two countries can be further 
strengthened for our mutual benefit," he added. 
  Lien later attended a dinner given by local overseas Chinese 
groups in his honor. 
  Lien will meet with Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon 
Carpio Friday to discuss matters of mutual concern. A 
ministerial-level meeting will also be held, with the 
participation of senior officials from the two countries. 
  ROC Economic Affairs Minister P.K. Chiang and Sun 
Ming-hsien, 
chairman of the Council of Agriculture, will discuss ways to 
boost bilateral cooperation in various fields with their 
Guatemalan counterparts. 
  Lien and De Leon will give a joint news conference Friday 
evening to explain future cooperative projects between the two 
countries. 
  Guatemala is the second leg of Lien's current Central 
American tour. He just ended a four-day visit to El Salvador 
where he attended the inauguration of new Salvadoran president, 
Armando Calderon Sol. 
  Lien will leave here for New York Sunday for a two-day 
private visit. Some sources said Lien may also stop in Mexico 
on his way to New York, but the rumor could not be confirmed. 
  The ROC does not maintain diplomatic ties with Mexico or the 
United States. Lien said his New York trip is purely for 
private purposes.

<F P=106> [Report by Jorge Katin] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday, the Sandinist Assembly made an fervent 
call to the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] grass 
roots to "unite around revolutionary objectives within the 
framework of decisions taken by the [FSLN National] Congress to 
set an example of flexibility by rejecting malicious traps, 
intolerance, and to strengthen camaraderie as well as 
constructive criticism." 
  The Sandinist Assembly, recently elected during the party's 
congress, met yesterday for the first time and proceeded to 
discuss the results of the elections, to select members of the 
Ethics and Judicial Commission, to elect a permanent Electoral 
Commission, to appoint three secretaries to the National 
Directorate, and to establish five work commissions. 
  Likewise, the assembly discussed issues such as a public 
debate on the results of the Sandinist congress and the thorny 
controversy of the media's support to Sandinism, especially the 
case of BARRICADA. 
  The new members of the Judicial and Ethics Commission 
include 
Miguel Angel Casco, Orlando Tardencilla, Onofre Guevara, Jose 
Pasos, Gladis Gomez, Yadira Centeno, Jorge Samper, Bruno 
Gallardo, Gloria Hernandez, Erwin Izaba. 
  The Electoral Commission includes Julian Corrales 
(president), Jeannete Chavez, Zadrach Zeledon, Ruth Herrera, and 
Jose Luis Villavicencio as principal members, and Edwin Castro 
as well as Josefina Ramos as alternates. 
  As has already been reported by BARRICADA, Monica Baltodano, 
Lumberto Campbell, and Victor Hugo Tinoco were elected 
secretaries of organization and education, communications, and 
international relations respectively. 
  Likewise, the Sandinist Assembly approved the creation of 
other commissions such as an agriculture commission, a youth 
commission, a women's commission, an Atlantic coast commission, 
and an economic-social commission. 
  Upon concluding the event, FSLN Deputy Secretary General 
Tomas Borge said that with respect to the media issue, it had 
been decided to "assess the situation" within the National 
Directorate, and to present a proposal afterwards before the 
Sandinist Assembly. 
  With respect to the debate to take place after the congress, 
it was confirmed the debate would be "free, open, and within the 
framework of the organizations members of the FSLN." 
  The absence of National Directorate member Henry Ruiz was 
quite obvious. Ruiz has abstained from participating in any of 
the meetings of the newly elected national directorate. 
<H5>  Calls for Penalties and More Media Control </H5>
  The issue of the public debate over the congress results, 
and 
the role of the media was included as part of the agenda under 
"other issues." Discussions began when Modesto Mungia, an 
assembly member and Managua District Three leader, stated that 
the media could be useful as instruments to continue "examining" 
the problem of divisions within the FSLN. 
  On the other hand, Felix Contreras pointed out that not only 
is the legitimacy of the congress under attack, but that "groups 
are organized to further split the FSLN." As an example, he 
pointed to a recent call to all Sandinists professionals to 
participate in an assembly scheduled to take place next Tuesday 
at the UCA [Central American University]. 
  William Grisgbi urged the National Directorate to "state its 
position on the scope of action of journalists, and 
responsibilities as assemblymen." Grisbi was referring to the 
controversy involving BARRICADA Director Carlos Fernando 
Chamorro and Danilo Aguirre, EL NUEVO DIARIO deputy director. 
  Nelson Artola, a San Ramon municipal leader asked "Who owns 
BARRICADA?" and immediately urged the FSLN to appropriate the 
media. 
  "We must penalize those comrades who are manipulating the 
results of the Congress, and we should do it with a steady hand 
and voice," Elias Chavez suggested. 
  In the meantime, National Directorate member Luis Carrion 
pointed out that "Neither the Assembly or the National 
Directorate should become media directors." In his opinion, 
overseeing mechanisms such as a directors council similar to the 
one operating at BARRICADA must be encouraged. 
  Nevertheless, Carlos Fonseca Teran insisted that "the 
problem 
lies in the clear intent to tarnish the congress' results." 
  In this respect, the harshest criticisms were directed at 
Sandinist Assembly member Danilo Aguirre, who is also EL NUEVO 
DIARIO deputy director. 
  Monica Baltodano, also a National Directorate member, urged 
all to "grab the bull by its horns," and that all those whom -- 
it would seem -- are attempting to "give a free rein to their 
ideas" should be called in and urged to speak clearly. 
  The controversy seemed to lose steam when BARRICADA Editor 
Carlos Fernando Chamorro addressed the assembly and indicated 
that this newspaper had been one of the few to cover the debates 
prior to, as well as following the congress. He also contended 
that the debate had been treated as taboo by the other media 
associated with Sandinism. 
  "Let's put the subject of the other media that did not cover 
the debate on the carpet," Chamorro pointed out. 
  Nevertheless, former BARRICADA sports director Emmett Lang 
restarted the controversy when he asked "what was the problem 
with suggesting Carlos Fernando's departure if he has already 
occupied the position for the past 14 years." Lang immediately 
added that "I am aware that because of this suggestion I will be 
attacked in tomorrow's edition of BARRICADA."

  [Text] Gabriel Lewis Galindo, designated foreign minister 
by president-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares, has said that 
Panama will study with "receptiveness" a formal U.S. proposal in 
terms of maintaining certain military installations on the 
Isthmus. 
  Lewis Galindo's declarations were made after his meeting 
with 
Senator Christopher Dodd, chairman of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee. During his first visit to Washington since 
he was designated, Lewis Galindo spoke extensively with several 
Democrat and Republican congressmen. 
  Recent publications indicate official planners are 
considering the possibility of maintaining U.S. air and 
communications installations in Panama. When questioned on this 
issue, however, the foreign minister highlighted that the 
current priority is to assure the transfer of the Canal to 
Panamanian control without setbacks and with the greatest 
efficiency possible. 
  Meanwhile, at the meeting held with James Fall III, U.S. 
Treasury deputy assistant secretary (Developing Nations), Lewis 
Galindo assured Fall that U.S. dollars "will continue to be the 
main currency used in Panama." 
  Today, Monday, the designated foreign minister will meet at 
the White House with Anthony Lake, assistant to the President 
for National Security Affairs, and tomorrow he will meet with 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Tomorrow Galindo also 
will meet with Enrique Iglesias, president of the Inter-American 
Development Bank.

  [Text] President Guillermo Endara has asked the members of 
the Rio Group to accept Panama's full reincorporation into the 
forum, which expelled Panama during the former regime of Manuel 
Antonio Noriega. 
  Endara explained that the conditions that led to Panama's 
expulsion are a thing of the past and that the country now is 
involved in a democratic process that became stronger with the 8 
May general elections -- elections in which opposition candidate 
Ernesto Perez Balladares was elected. 
  Endara's petition was expressed in a letter he sent to the 
Rio Group. In the letter, Endara stressed: I feel an era is 
ending with this last diplomatic effort I am making today. With 
your support, my country and people will again occupy a place of 
honor which, because of a lack of democracy, was suddenly 
snatched away from them, and which now, thank God, is being 
returned.

<F P=106> [Article by Marti Ostrander Oller; figures as published] </F>
  [Text] The latest comptroller general report announces the 
1994 government budget totals $1,928,635,600, including revenues 
and expenses. 
  The report says regular income will total $1,415,832,100, 
including tax revenues and assessed and indirect taxes. 
  Approximately $481.5 million will be nontax revenue, while 
$512.8 million will be pumped into the national economy by 
capital income. 
  The latter figure includes external credit resources for 
$324.3 million; that is, loans by international financial 
institutions, government credits and donations, the bank cash 
balance, national wealth, and the sale of assets, among other 
things. 
  On the expenses side, operational costs of $1.547 billion is 
noteworthy and is divided into operating expenses ($785.3 
million), the public debt ($493 million), and the transfer of 
functions expenses [transferencia de funcionamiento] ($269.6 
million). 
  Investment expenses are $380.7 million. 
  A total of approximately $688 million is destined for the 
executive branch, including all the ministries and 
administrative expenses. The Education Ministry, with $214.5 
million, the Government and Justice Ministry ($149.7 million), 
and the Health Ministry ($139.2 million) budgets are noteworthy. 
  Meanwhile, the judicial branch will spend $46.3 million, 
while the legislative branch will spend $34.7 million, divided 
into $16.9 million for the Legislative Assembly and $17.8 
million for the Comptroller General's Office. 
  Article 147 of Law No. 32 states if revenues are expected to 
be lower than authorized budgeted expenses, a plan to reduce 
those expenses will be presented at a cabinet meeting in order 
to avoid a deficit. 
  The report also states budget expenses up to 31 December 
were 
$1.553 million, with a $16.6-million surplus, which was applied 
to standard and capital expenses. 
  Meanwhile, there was a saving of $328.2 million in total 
regular income vs. regular expenses.

<F P=106> [Comparison of articles of the current Constitution and the </F>
proposed amendment of those articles] 
  [Text] Article 136. Constitution. 
  An autonomous tribunal is hereby established to guarantee 
the 
popular election's freedom, purity, and effectiveness. The 
tribunal's legal status, patrimony, and the right to manage it 
are hereby recognized. The tribunal shall exclusively interpret 
and apply the Electoral Law. It shall direct and supervise the 
registration of vital statistics, such as decease, 
naturalization, and other juridical acts related to the civil 
status of people, the issuance of personal identification cards, 
and the electoral process' various stages. (The rest of the 
article remains unchanged, except the name: Supreme Electoral 
Tribunal). 
<H5>  Proposed Amendments </H5>
  A Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE], with its own rank and 
independent from the states branches, is hereby established to 
guarantee the popular election's freedom, purity, and 
effectiveness. The TSE shall have jurisdiction throughout the 
country. It shall be made up of three magistrates, who must 
meet the same requirements demanded of a Supreme Court of 
Justice [CSJ] magistrate. The three TSE magistrates shall be 
appointed for a 10-year term. One of them shall be proposed by 
the Legislative Branch, one by the Executive, and one by the 
CSJ. The candidates shall not be members of the proposing 
branch. Two alternates shall be similarly proposed for each of 
the principals. The alternates cannot be chosen from among the 
TSE officials. The TSE magistrates shall answer to the CSJ for 
offenses or crimes committed during the exercise of their 
functions. Articles 202, 205, 208, 209, and 213 apply, with the 
penalties stipulated by law. 
<H5>  Magistrates' Explanations </H5>
  1. The name Electoral Tribunal has been substituted for 
that of Supreme Electoral Tribunal, like in Costa Rica, 
Guatemala, Ecuador, and El Salvador. 
  2. The TSE is given the status of a government branch 
without it becoming one, like in Costa Rica. 
  3. The TSE's administrative and financial autonomy is 
established. It is exempted from preliminary control, to make 
sure that it will not be co-managed from the public finance's 
viewpoint. 
<H5>  Article 137. Constitution. </H5>
  The Electoral Tribunal shall have the following functions: 
  .... 
  3. To establish the Electoral Law bylaws, interpret and 
apply the law, and hear any controversies originating from its 
application. 
  4. To punish offenses and crimes committed against the 
freedom and purity of the elections, according to the law. 
  7. To process immigration and naturalization requests. 
  (Paragraphs 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7 remain unchanged. Paragraphs 3 
and 6 are modified. One paragraph is eliminated. Paragraphs 8 
and 9 are introduced.) 
<H5>  Proposed Amendments </H5>
  In addition to those outlined by law, the TSE shall have the 
following functions, which it will exercise exclusively, except 
those stipulated in Paragraphs 4 and 6. 
  1. To register births, marriages, deaths, naturalizations, 
and any other events and juridical acts related to the civil 
status of people, and to make the corresponding annotations in 
the corresponding registers. 
  2. To issue personal identification cards. 
  3. To interpret the constitutional and legal directives on 
elections, to establish Electoral Law bylaws, and to hear any 
controversies originating from the application of the law. 
  4. To conduct an electoral census. 
  5. To organize, to direct, and to supervise the 
registration of voters, and to settle any controversies, 
complaints, or allegations related to voter registration. 
  6. To process naturalization requests, according to the 
law. 
  7. To appoint members of electoral corporations, in which 
the representation of legally created parties shall be 
guaranteed. The law will regulate this matter. 
  8. To assume control of the Public Forces from the opening 
of the electoral process and until the new president of the 
Republic is proclaimed, with the exclusive purpose of 
guaranteeing the freedom, purity, and effectiveness of the 
popular elections. The Executive will continue to control the 
Public Forces for everything related to national defense and the 
protection of the lives, honor, and property of the nationals 
and aliens under its jurisdiction. The fulfillment of these 
responsibilities shall not serve as an excuse for interfering 
with the political and party neutrality the Public Forces must 
maintain during the electoral process. 
  9. To appoint ad honorem Electoral Delegates according to 
the law. The TSE's decisions regarding elections only can be 
appealed before itself and the appeal will be final, 
irrevocable, and binding once the legal procedures have been 
complied with. Amparo recourses or inconstitutionality 
warnings, with the exception of unconstituionality recourse, 
shall not apply. 
<H5>  Magistrates' Explanations </H5>
  1. As in Costa Rica, the TSE is given the authority to 
interpret electoral regulations both from the Constitutional and 
legal viewpoints. 
  2. Its authority to handle electoral offenses has been 
removed. 
  3. Its authority to handle immigration, which had never 
been regulated, has been removed. The tribunal retains its 
authority to handle naturalizations according to the law. (At 
present, those requesting naturalization are tested on history, 
geography, and politics). 
  4. A legal provision is made for the transfer of authority 
over the Public Forces to the tribunal and the time for the 
tribunal to assume control of the Public Forces is extended from 
the current six days before the elections to six months. As the 
Electoral Tribunal did in a decree, the proposed amendment 
clarifies that this control of the Public Forces extends up to 
the time when the new President of the Repubic is proclaimed. 
  5. As in Costa Rica, the Electoral Delegates at the 
Constitutional level are recognized. 
  6. Recourses cannot be filed against the Electoral 
Tribunal's decisions on electoral matters only and that no 
amparos (as established by law) or unconstitutionality warnings 
(as established by the Tribunal's decision and confirmed by the 
CSJ) shall apply. Unconstitutionality recourses can be applied, 
however. 
<H5>  Constitution in Effect </H5>
  Art. 138. The Office of the Electoral Prosecutor is an 
independent investigation agency assisting the Electoral 
Tribunal. 
  The Electoral Prosecutor will be appointed by the Execuve 
Branch subject to the approval of the Legislative Branch... 
  The Electoral Prosecutor's responsibilities are: 
  1. To safeguard the political privileges of all citizens. 
  2. To watch over the official conduct of all public 
officials relating to electoral priviliges and political 
obligations. 
  3. To prosecute electoral crimes and violations. 
  4. To exercise all other duties the law may indicate. 
<H5>  Reform Proposal </H5>
  Investigations and trials related to electoral crimes will 
fall under the competence of ordinary jurisdiction. 
  Transitory paragraph: The Office of the Electoral Prosecutor 
will become an Electoral Delegate Attorney's Office assigned to 
the Office of the Attorney General and specializing in electoral 
offenses. Those election violations still pending to be 
processed at the Electoral Tribunal will be forwarded to the 
appropiate penal courts in accordance with the respective 
competence, except those cases where appeals are still pending. 
Cases where the Electoral Tribunal has already ruled will be 
appealable before the Supreme Court of Justice Penal Court. 
<H5>  Explanations by the Magistrates </H5>
  In eliminating the Electoral Tribunal's competence with 
respect to penal electoral issues, penal electoral jurisdiction 
is eliminated as a separate jurisdiction to incorporate it into 
ordinary jurisdiction. For this to take place, the Office of 
the Electoral Prosecutor must be abolished as an independent 
institution so that it may be incorporated into the Office of 
the Attorney General. 
  This measure not only solves the fact that the Panamanian 
Electoral Tribunal is the only one if its kind throughout the 
world that decides on electoral offenses, but it also 
automatically grants the accused the right to file an appeal 
before a higher jurisdiction. Currently, individuals accused of 
electoral offenses are not entitled to this measure since 
decisions by the Electoral Tribunal are unappealable. Likewise, 
the destiny of the different cases currently being processed are 
to be determined on a provisional basis. 
<H5>  Constitution in Effect </H5>
  Art. 139. Public authorities are obligated to follow and 
obey guidelines and decisions of officials with electoral 
jurisdiction. Public authorities are also obligated to comply 
with, cooperate with, and assist officials with electoral 
jurisdiction carry out their obligations. Disregard and 
negligence on the part of public authorities in performing their 
respective duties will be punishable in accordance with the law. 
  (The proposed incidental clauses are to be added to this 
article) 
<H5>  Reform Proposed </H5>
  The following incidental clauses are to be added to Article 
139: 
  The Supreme Elections Tribunal will formulate its budget 
proposal and will forward it to the Executive Branch. The 
Supreme Electoral Tribunal magistrates will be allowed to 
justify the respective proposed budget project in all its 
phases. The Supreme electoral Tribunal budget will not be less 
than seven tenths of one percent of the Central Government's 
current revenues. During elections and referendum years, and 
those years prior, the additional budget requested and justified 
by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal will have precedence within 
the public sector's budget. Nevertheless, when the quantity 
resulting from the application of said percentage is greater 
than the amount required to cover basic needs proposed by the 
Supreme Electoral Tribunal, the Executive Branch will be allowed 
to include the surplus as part of other expenditures or 
investments in the public sector budget proposal. 
<H5>  Explanation by the Magistrates </H5>
  The amendments assure the Electoral Tribunal will have a 
minimum of resources for its regular functions, as one must keep 
in mind that it in is charge of the civil registry and the 
issuance of cedulas. During an election or referenda period 
priority is granted to the budget required to hold the 
elections. It is the same text of the amendments approved in 
1992. 
<H5>  Article 141 </H5>
  (It explains in detail how the current electoral circuits 
are 
established in line with the political administrative division 
and the number of inhabitants. It establishes one legislator 
for those parties that retain their legal status but no 
candidate to legislator from that party was elected. It 
establishes that only political parties can nominate candidates 
for legislators.) 
<H5>  Amendment bill </H5>
  The Legislative Assembly will comprise 20 national 
legislators and 41 legislators elected in circuits where 
individual [uninominal] candidates run through the regulations 
approved to that effect by the Supreme Elections, taking into 
consideration the population, territorial proximity, 
concentration of Indian population, neighborhood ties, roads, 
and historic and cultural factors. No province nor the San Blas 
Reservation will have less than one legislator. Every time a 
national population census is held, the Supreme Elections 
Tribunal will review and update the creation of electoral 
circuits to maintain the proportion of the population among them. 
  The seats of national legislators will be assigned to the 
parties that have garnered the votes needed to retain their 
legal status based on the proportion of the votes the parties 
obtain in the presidential elections, following the order of the 
candidates in each list. The candidate with the most votes will 
be elected in circuits where individual candidates are running. 
Each legislator will have a personal alternate who will be 
elected when the legislator is elected. The legislator will 
replace his alternate if case of wrongdoing. 
<H5>  Magistrates' Explanations </H5>
  1. The composition of the current Legislative Assembly, 
which is based upon uninominal and plurinominal electoral 
districts that lack a fixed number of legislators because their 
number increases every 10 years according to population growth, 
will be changed to an Assembly that has a fixed number of 
legislators, thereby incorporating the concept of national 
legislators and legislators from uninominal districts only. 
Plurinominal electoral districts are thus eliminated, because 
these districts have traditionally sparked tension and vote 
challenges in every elections due to the complexity of the 
proportional representation system. In addition, uninominal 
electoral districts endorse the principle of governability that 
has successfully prevailed in the United Kingdom and France. 
  2. The known concept of the "Lone Ranger" legislator is 
also eliminated. This concept, which increases the number of 
legislators, is being used for the first time in 1994 in the 
case of the National Renewal Movement (Morena). 
  3. The election of two alternates is eliminated. Only 
one personal alternate will be elected in the same manner 
legislators are elected. 
<H5>  Constitution </H5>
  Article 144. Legislators shall act on behalf of the Nation, 
and at the Legislative Assembly, they represent their respective 
political parties and voters from their Electoral Districts. 
<H5>  Amendment </H5>
  Once elected, legislators shall represent the Nation and 
shall observe only the dictates of their consciences. 
<H5>  Magistrates' Explanations </H5>
  As the concept of impeachment is eliminated, it is necessary 
to modify this article to reinstate the principle of the 1946 
Constitution. 
<H5>  Constitution </H5>
  Article 145. Political parties shall be able to impeach the 
legislators and alternates they nominate... (requirements and 
procedures are stipulated). 
<H5>  Amendment </H5>
  This article is abolished. 
<H5>  Magistrates' Explanations </H5>
  The controversial guideline that grants political parties 
the 
right to impeach a legislator elected by the population is 
eliminated. We reinstate the principle of the 1946 
Constitution, which stipulates that legislators represent the 
Nation and are not subjected to any mandate. 
<H5>  Constitution </H5>
  Article 147. The following is required to be a legislator: 
  ... 4. Not have been previously tried for having committed a 
crime against public administration and sentenced to lose his 
freedom. The Electoral Tribunal could not have tried him for 
having committed a crime against the honesty and integrity of 
the suffrage. 
<H5>  Amendment </H5>
  The following is required to be a legislator: 
  1. Be Panamanian by birth or by naturalization, with 15 
years of residency in the country after having obtained the 
citizenship. 
  2. Be an acting citizen. 
  3. Be 21 years old at election time. 
  4. Not have been tried for committing a crime against the 
public administration or for committing an electoral crime 
whereby freedom was lost. 
<H5>  Magistrates' Explanations </H5>
  The residency requirement for legislators, which has 
triggered so much controversy, is eliminated. It has been 
stipulated that with honest and fair elections, a candidate's 
financial situation is not the requirement that will let him be 
nominated by an electoral district where he does not live and be 
elected beyond people's will. As the electoral and penal 
jurisdiction is eliminated, it conforms with the wording of 
point 4 of Article 147. 
<H5>  Constitution </H5>
  Article 159. The following shall be able to propose laws: 
  ... 3. The Supreme Court of Justice, the Attorney General, 
and the Solicitor General as long as it alludes the issuance of 
or amendments to national codes. 
<H5>  Amendment </H5>
  The following shall be able to propose laws: 
  ... 3. The Supreme Court of Justice, the Attorney General, 
and the Solicitor General as long as it alludes the issuance of 
or amendments to national codes, as well as the Supreme 
Electoral Tribunal [Tribunal Superior de Elecciones] as long as 
it alludes to issues concerning elections, civil registry, and 
issuance of personal identification cards. 
<H5>  Magistrates' Explanations </H5>
  The Electoral Tribunal has the initiative on matters that 
must come under its jurisdiction, but currently do not.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 2 Jun (NA) -- President Carlos Menem 
said this morning that the fact that some governors can be 
reelected while others, such as Buenos Aires Governor Eduardo 
Duhalde, cannot is "a totally repugnant inequality." 
  Menem said it is "a tremendous injustice" to prevent the 
reelection of some governors when most provinces already have a 
clause allowing the governor's reelection, and the 
constitutional reform will grant the president that opportunity 
as well. 
  Menem said that Buenos Aires Governor Eduardo Duhalde "will 
not create any problems" at the Constituent Assembly, because 
"what he wants is the reform of the national Constitution, and 
then through the proper channels, the reform of the provincial 
Constitution." 
  Menem said the convention "is not deadlocked," as delegates 
"are looking for consensus." Menem did not rule out the 
possibility of proposing a clause permitting the reelection of 
governors at the Constituent Assembly. 
  Menem said, however, that it was not clear how convention 
delegates would include that clause in the agenda. Menem said 
the reform of provincial constitutions must be carried out in 
each district. 
  The decision to include the issue "will be determined by 
convention delegates. I think there are various alternatives. 
I am not siding with any one of them. I think provincial 
constitutions must be reformed according to proceedings 
established in each one of the provincial constitutions," the 
president said. 
  Menem made these remarks at government house after 
inspecting 
the work under way to remodel the building. Menem said he will 
meet with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Boston between 22 and 
24 June within the framework of his unofficial visit to that 
country and following his tour of Canada. 
  After the announcement, NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS learned that the 
head of state will take advantage of the opportunity to watch 
the soccer match between the Argentine and Nigerian national 
teams on 25 June. 
  The president talked extensively on the radio program La 
9.90. He reiterated that "professional agitators who have 
already been acting in other places have arrived" in Tierra del 
Fuego. He added that "hooded individuals are frustrating 
people's right to work." 
  He said those groups are responsible for "impairing and 
frustrating the freedom to work," stressing that these methods 
"will not lead us anywhere," and urging striking workers "to 
return to work." 
  The president denied that the government is being pressured 
by entrepreneurs, and recommended all parties involved in the 
conflict to sit down and talk "to reach an agreement and 
resolve" the situation. 
  On another subject, the president said that he supports the 
initiative of some legislators to invest $1.5 billion in the 
construction of houses in northern provinces within 90 days. 
  "A total of $1.5 billion will be invested in housing 
construction within 90 days," the president said. 
  Menem also said that the government will urge the provinces 
to speed up the reform of their administrations to reduce the 
deficit. 
  "Provincial governments have not fulfilled the agreements 
with the national government. The reform of provincial 
administrations has not yet been implemented," the president 
said. 
  [Buenos Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS in Spanish at 1224 GMT on 
2 
April adds: "President Carlos Menem said that the Justicialist 
Party `will fully respect' the Olivos Pact at the Constituent 
Assembly, and therefore the clause establishing the presidential 
election `is assured.' 
  ["Menem confirmed that he will meet with his U.S. 
counterpart 
Bill Clinton during a stopover in Boston upon his return from 
Canada in the second half of the month." 
  [NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS also adds, at 1319 GMT on 2 April: 
"President Carlos Menem said today that there is an attempt to 
create `a class struggle' in Tierra del Fuego, adding that the 
situation `is typical of Marxists.' 
  ["During the La 9.90 program Menem criticized Marcelo Sosa, 
UOM [Metalworkers Union] Ushuaia branch secretary general, 
because through his calls he `is trying to return to the past 
and provoke a situation we have long overcome.'"]

  [Text] Politicians and trade union leaders on 31 May 
criticized the government's position in the Tierra del Fuego 
Province conflict. About 300 people, called by leftist parties, 
marched on 31 May in repudiation of police repression. UCR 
[Radical Civic Union] leader Juan Manuel Casella asked for no 
intervention in the province "like it was done in Santiago del 
Estero and Jujuy Provinces, sending border policemen to carry 
out a repressive mission to please [Economy] Minister Cavallo." 
  Casella supported Rio Grande Mayor Jorge Colazo "in his 
position of solidarity with the workers." Casella said the 
government demonstrated "its idea of quenching dissent and 
expressions of rejection of its economic policies. [no closing 
quotation marks as published] Grand Front Deputy Graciela 
Fernandez Meijide also criticized President Carlos Menem. She 
noted that it is "not possible" to attribute all the conflicts 
in the country's interior "to alleged activists." Fernandez 
Meijide asked the government to have "a bit of common sense" to 
admit that the conflicts in Santiago del Estero Province, Jujuy 
Province, and southern Argentina "have been prompted by 
something more significant than the presence of agitators." 
  UCR Deputy Enrique Mathov, who has been visiting Ushuaia 
since 28 May, asked the federal government "to implement all the 
mechanisms available to it to prevent the conflict from 
escalating."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 2 Jun (NA) -- The national secretariat 
of the General Confederation of Labor [CGT] today expressed in a 
communique its "unconditional solidarity with the Tierra del 
Fuego workers who are striking in defense of their labor rights 
and their salaries." 
  Referring to the strike being staged by the Tierra del Fuego 
metalworkers, the CGT stated that it supports the workers' calls 
"for maintaining the source of jobs, and warned that any delay 
in adopting measures to protect the regional economies, create 
jobs, and strengthen national industry will result in further 
social conflicts that will become increasingly more difficult to 
solve." 
  The CGT also called for "the immediate adoption of measures 
to ensure that all provincial and municipal workers receive 
their overdue salaries." 
  The CGT believes that "the alarming unemployment level -- 
which has surpassed historical records -- lays bare the reality 
of an ever-increasing impoverishment of large sectors of 
Argentine society, which results in social marginalization 
problems, forces students to quit school, causes infant 
malnutrition, and so forth." 
  The communique concluded by pointing out that "unemployment 
is caused by lack of incentives for production and the unfair 
competition faced by products manufactured in Argentina."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 2 Jun (NA) -- "Boys, the formula 
returns." With an expansive smile and this remark, which may be 
an indication, President Carlos Menem on 1 June received the 
photographers and cameramen that recorded the meeting he had 
with Buenos Aires Province Governor Eduardo Duhalde at 
Government House. 
  Flanked by [Presidency] Secretary General Eduardo Bauza and 
Buenos Aires Province Deputy Governor Rafael "Balito" Roma, 
Menem and Duhalde waited standing up in the presidential office 
for the cameras and television crews to enter. 
  As though he wanted to demonstrate that his spats with 
Duhalde are pure fantasy, Menem was openly at ease and was even 
heard to talk with the governor about Argentina's win over 
Israel [in a 31 May soccer match]. 
  With a conspirator's smile, Menem then faced photographers 
and cameramen, to whom he said: "Boys, the formula once again," 
referring to the possibility of repeating the two-man [ticket] 
that led the Justicialist Party to victory on 14 May 1989. 
  Duhalde could do no less than smile at the quip made by 
Menem, who, behind the scenes, once again began to pull the 
governor's leg regarding the size of his head: "He always 
overshadows me."

  [Excerpt] Santa Fe, 1 Jun (NA) -- The National Constituent 
Assembly resumed sessions today. It continued discussing the 
rules and regulations that will govern the Constituent Assembly 
sessions. Neuquen Grand Front Jaime De Nevares has resigned as a 
constituent assembly member. 
  The Neuquen bishop emeritus supported his resignation, 
claiming that the Constituent Assembly "is completely null and 
void," adding that the Constituent Assembly is "a farce." 
  With De Nevares' departure, the Grand Front loses a seat 
because vacant seats are not replaced after members have taken 
the oath. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 1 Jun (NA) -- Chubut Governor Carlos 
Maestro said today that people in his province are concerned 
"over the lack of incentives for the development of productive 
activities, specially for small and medium-sized industries." 
  Maestro emphasized: "The lack of encouragement for regional 
economies has caused many companies to collapse." 
  He went to Government House to meet Presidential Secretary 
General Eduardo Bauza and Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf. He 
said: "Chubut is trying to implement key mechanisms to 
revitalize production." 
  Maestro noted: "This involves fiscal policies like the 
removal of taxes. We have removed energy taxes and rural real 
estate taxes and are now implementing a dynamic loan policy." 
  The Chubut governor emphasized that his province "currently 
has a $100-million loan portfolio for productive sectors, with 
very low interest rates, 10-year repayment periods, and up to 
three-year grace periods to begin repaying loans." 
  The Radical Civic Union governor concluded: "By implementing 
all these measures, we are trying to alleviate a very complex 
situation in the field of production."

  [Excerpt] Buenos Aires, 1 Jun (NA) -- Tucuman Governor 
Ramon "Palito" Ortega admitted today that his province has a 
monthly deficit of 6.5 million pesos. He blames this situation 
on the signing of the Fiscal Pact with the federal government 
and on the transfer of federal schools to the provincial 
government. 
  Ortega indicated that his province has a "deficit" because 
of 
"the non-collection of revenues following the signing of the 
Fiscal Pact, which caused a social security deficit of 3.5 
million pesos." 
  The governor also blamed the situation on the transfer of 
federal schools to the provincial government and on salary 
increases for teachers. He emphasized that the latter measures 
increased the monthly deficit to 6.5 million pesos. [passage

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Argentina monitored through 2 
June. 
  Media Secretary Raul Burzaco reported that Economy Minister 
Domingo Cavallo today informed the cabinet that the total 
provincial deficit stands at $1.3 billion, of which $500 million 
involves the northwestern provinces. (Buenos Aires Radio 
Nacional Network in Spanish 1600 GMT 27 May 94) 
  It was reported that the unemployment rate hit 12 percent at 
the end of April 1994, or an increase of 2.7 percent in the past 
six months. In October 1993 the unemployment rate stood at 9.3 
percent. Industrial circles blamed the increase on foreign 
competition, increasing internal costs, and the incorporation of 
new machinery and technologies that replace labor. (Buenos 
Aires LA PRENSA in Spanish 1 Jun 94 Economic Section p 5)

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 1 Jun (NA) -- Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres said tonight that the "hand of a foreign country" 
was involved in the attack against his country's embassy in 
Buenos Aires on 17 March 1992. Peres made clear, however, that 
"the details will be known only when the investigation has been 
completed." 
  Peres condemned the presence of Nazis in Argentina, saying 
"assassins must be punished wherever they might be because the 
law does not give anyone a license to kill another human being." 
Peres said he is "against all assassins in history." 
  The Israeli foreign minister held a news conference at 
Government House after his one-hour meeting with President 
Carlos Menem. Peres briefed Menem on the status of the Middle 
East peace process since the historic signing of an agreement 
with the Palestinian people. 
  Peres said he started a round of briefings with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton "and wanted to end it with President 
Menem." 
  His meeting with the president was possible because the 
plane 
carrying the foreign minister from Santiago to Madrid made a 
technical stopover at Ezeiza Airport, which gave Peres a chance 
to request an audience with President Menem. 
  Peres said the peace process with Yasir 'Arafat's 
Palestinians "was achieved and is irreversible." He also said 
that his intention was "to move forward and not backward." 
  Peres recognized that the signing of the agreement's first 
chapter with the Palestinians "was not an easy matter. We had 
problems, but I think it is a great achievement." 
  Peres said Israel "is negotiating with Syrians, Jordanians, 
Lebanese, and also with Palestinians on the issue of autonomy" 
because we want "to create a new way (of life) in the Middle 
East where security for the four nations will be guaranteed, 
permitting the development of an economic system that will allow 
these nations to improve their future prospects within the 
boundaries of respect for human rights and freedom."

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Bolivia monitored through 2 
June. 
  Central Bank President Fernando Candia has reported that the 
fiscal deficit dropped by 206 million bolivianos in real terms 
during the first quarter of the year. He noted that public 
sector expenses dropped by 86 million bolivianos and that 
revenues rose by 120 million Bolivianos during this period. He 
said exports rose by 34 percent while imports rose by just 3.8 
percent. The balance of payment deficit dropped 80 million 
bolivianos compared with the same period in 1993. (Santa Cruz EL 
MUNDO in Spanish 21 May 94 National Section p 2) 
  The trade balance foreign reserve account amounted to $504 
million in the first four months of the year, registering a $4 
million surplus. Exports totaled $130.2 million and money 
deposited in banks over exports amounted to $209.7 million. 
(Santa Cruz EL MUNDO in Spanish 23 May 94 National Section p 3) 
  The Muller Inc. consulting firm has reported that, in spite 
of difficulties in the financial sector, the banking system is 
showing a significant increase which guarantees financial 
stability. The group of largest banks have resources of over 
$400 million, middle-sized banks have between $200 million and 
$400 million, and small banks have less than $200 million. 
(Santa Cruz EL MUNDO in Spanish 26 May 94 National Section p 1) 
  Edmundo Salvatierra, the Bolivian Government Oil Deposits 
[YPFB] industrial manager, has disclosed that the YPFB plans to 
invest some $23 million this year to explore, produce, and store 
crude oil and natural gas in the tropical region of Cochabamba 
department. Salvatierra said the Finance and Economy 
Development Ministry has approved YPFB investments worth $103 
million throughout the country. The projects involve 
exploration in Carrasco and Katari deposits and the Ivirza XI 
well, production in Carrasco X-5 and Carrasco X-6 wells, and the 
storing of crude oil extracted from Surubi, Carrasco, Katari, 
and Bulo Bulo oilfields that will be sent to Cochabamba and 
Santa Cruz. (La Paz PRESENCIA in Spanish 27 May 94 Second

  [Text] Brasilia, 1 Jun (AE) -- The PMDB [Brazilian 
Democratic Movement Party] deputy for Santa Catarina, Luiz 
Henrique -- the president of the PMDB, today told President 
Itamar Franco that despite criticism from PMDB presidential 
candidate Orestes Quercia, the party will continue supporting 
the government. "We have to separate the electoral side from the 
institutional side," he said, "Quercia knows about our decision 
and he understands that the PMDB, with its blocs in the Chamber 
of Deputies and the Senate, is essential for guaranteeing the 
country's stability." 
  In return, Franco assured Luiz Henrique that the government 
will not put the government apparatus at the service of any 
candidate and the president will not demand a unified opinion on 
the subject from his ministers. "The president did not prohibit 
any government member from joining an electoral campaign during 
off-duty hours," he said, "He never said it, at least not that I 
know." 
  Henrique explained that a government official -- he did not 
report his name -- informed Franco that he would hold an 
executive position in a campaign. "I do not know who the 
official is; I only know that the president advised him to 
resign," Henrique said, "There is nothing wrong with ministers, 
most of whom are politicians, publicly expressing their 
preferences."

  [Text] Brasilia, 2 Jun (AE) -- The vice presidential 
candidate for the Popular Brazil Front, Senator Jose Paulo Bisol 
(PSB-RS) [Brazilian Socialist Party, Rio Grande do Sul] today 
reasserted that violence to protect oneself from violence is 
currently guaranteed in the Penal and Civil Codes. Overwhelmed 
with the misery he found on the outskirts of Brasilia, Bisol 
said yesterday during a meeting with the people of Santa Maria 
that violence is justified when it is used to resist violence 
for which the government is directly responsible. 
  As a retired appellate judge, Bisol recalled that he has 
spent years judging cases of legitimate and illegitimate 
violence. "The people have the right to take the law into their 
own hands when the government cannot guarantee justice," he 
said. According to Bisol, this norm is included in any modern 
study of the general theory of law. He said that with the 
increase of violence and insecurity in the cities, the rich are 
protecting themselves, equip their houses with alarms, and even 
buy weapons with which to defend themselves. "The poor do not 
have police protection or weapons with which to defend 
themselves," he said. 
  According to Bisol, his statements in defense of the 
revolution, which were widely covered by the newspapers, were 
originated following a meeting he had with two women in the 
satellite city of Santa Maria. They complained about the lack 
of security, and told him their daughters had been raped as a 
consequence of the lack of police protection in one of the most 
violent areas of the Federal District. The senator's statements 
were interpreted on the following day as a speech in defense of 
violence. "Anyone can defend his possessions with violence," 
Bisol clarified today. He said that as a candidate for vice 
president he is worried that his statements during the election 
campaign are being taken "out of context." 
  He said that some days ago he referred to the presidential 
candidate for the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso, as a sociologist, noting that 
sometimes people show wisdom in one field and ignorance in 
another, as for example in the juridical field. Bisol said: 
"On the following day a newspaper published that I had called 
Cardoso ignorant." This is why the senator announced that he 
intends in the next few days to speak with the attorney general, 
and suggest to him a meeting among politicians and journalists 
to carry out a campaign focused on "more substantial issues." 
Bisol said that if the current trend continues, the candidates 
will have to spend most of their time justifying their 
statements.

<F P=106> [Article by Helena Tachinardi] </F>
  [Text] Brazil has presided and will preside over many 
diplomatic meetings this year. Among them are the OAS general 
assembly in Belem in June, the Mercosur [Common Market of the 
South] member countries conference to define its institutions 
during the second half of the year, the Rio Group presidential 
summit in October, and the meeting of South Atlantic countries. 
The events that occurred earlier this year include Mercosur and 
Rio Group meetings with EU foreign ministers; the visit of 
Douglas Hurd, British secretary of state for foreign and 
commonwealth affairs, and other British secretaries; and the 
visit of U.S. Vice President Al Gore and other U.S. officials. 
All this reveals the increasing involvement of Brazil in the 
world economy and the current global and regional 
characteristics of trade. 
  Last week Brazilian diplomacy achieved a very important 
objective: Its proposal to create a South American free trade 
zone (SAFTA) was accepted in principle by Brazil's Mercosur 
partners (Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay). 
  Events like this, and the recent opening of a general 
consulate in Nagoya, Japan, to assist the "deka-seguis" -- some 
200,000 Brazilian citizens of Japanese descent who emigrated to 
Japan seeking jobs -- shows that Brazilian diplomacy is seeking 
to involve Brazil in the international economy and to change its 
profile from a country receiving immigrants to a country 
exporting workers. 
  Brazilian foreign policy has been becoming more pragmatic 
and 
integrating more with the private universe of the economy. The 
Foreign Ministry recently organized two entrepreneurial missions 
-- one to Asia and South Africa and one to Mozambique. 
Brazilian ambassadors before the GATT and the Latin American 
Integration Association (ALADI) increased their involvement with 
entrepreneurs, informing them of the evolution of global and 
regional trade negotiations. Foreign Minister Celso Amorim has 
kept legislators fully briefed on Brazilian commitments with its 
partners. 

  -  Nuclear Policy: The Foreign Ministry persuaded Congress to 
approve all its agreements on nuclear policy during this 
semester. The only item still pending is a draft bill on 
controls on exports of sensitive materials and technologies, an 
essential step prior to Brazil joining the missile technology 
control regime (MTCR). 

  Contrary to what was done by Mexico -- which withdrew this 
year from the Group of 77 (formed by 126 developing countries) 
after accepting a preferential option in North America through 
its participation in NAFTA with the United States and Canada -- 
Brazil is not considering withdrawing from any association. 

  -  International Order: Ronaldo Sardenberg, Brazilian 
ambassador to the United Nations recalls: "Participants have 
increased in the area of international order. We have the Group 
of 77, the Latin American and Caribbean group (33 countries, all 
of which participate in UN organizations), Mercosur, the South 
Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone, the Group of 15 (most 
important developing countries), the Portuguese-speaking 
community of countries, just to mention some." He added: "From 
the diplomatic point of view, it is necessary to participate in 
all of these groups because they provide the bases for positions 
and give us better negotiating conditions." 

  The ambassador observed that the Group of 77 "is a factor 
of international negotiation for Brazil. The reform of the 
Global Environmental Facility (GEF) -- a global environment fund 
-- is being negotiated between the Group of 77 and developing 
countries. There is also an electoral aspect to all this: 
Brazil was elected to participate in different organs." He 
added: "Brazil does not have a Greta Garbo complex. We do not 
want to be alone. Our international style is that of a moderate 
country trying to find solutions to different problems. We have 
been on the UN Security Council more often than any other 
country (as a nonpermanent member). 

  -  UN Security Council: Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, who 
recently met with his French, British, and German counterparts, 
usually tells his guests that "Brazilian credentials are either 
perceived immediately or never." The country is campaigning 
unostentatiously for a permanent seat on the UN Security 
Council, a decision that could be made next year during the 
organization's 50th anniversary. Amorim notes: "We share 
borders with 10 countries. We have a large population, a large 
territory, and a presence in the international arena that is 
unsurpassed by any developing country. We help international 
organizations reach agreements. We have not been to war with 
any of our neighbors in the past 120 years. We have a history 
of peace that is matched by very few countries." He added: "If 
Brazil becomes a member of the UN Security Council it will be on 
its own merit, not to represent Latin America." 
  -  Drug 
Trafficking: Brazil will participate in UN international 
peace-keeping forces as it did in Suez (Gaza Strip) and in the 
Congo. Sardenberg believes Brazil will send a battalion, an 
organized force, to countries like Mozambique. In the military 
field, the idea that the Armed Forces should not participate in 
drug enforcement actions seems to have been 
consolidated. 
  -  Africa: Brazilian diplomats hail their position 
regarding South Africa. Two years ago Itamaraty upgraded the 
Brazilian presence in South Africa by sending an ambassador. 
Brazil thus anticipated the end of the "apartheid" and 
currently has good business perspectives with Nelson Mandela's 
government. Amorim recently asked Finance Minister Rubens 
Ricupero for $20 million to finance Brazilian company projects 
in Mozambique, the economic situation of which Itamaraty expects 
to improve with the democratization of South Africa. 
  -  Eastern 
Europe: Brazil has been less aggressive in this region. The 
Brazilian foreign minister said: "They are more active than us. 
We must react to this," adding, "I would like to send a 
business mission to Central Europe. Trade relations with those 
countries must be reestablished." Amorim said he will send the 
Itamaraty secretary general to Moscow at the end of the year 
because the situation in Russia "is stabilizing and this will 
open up trade opportunities." The Foreign Ministry is planning 
to open an embassy in Kiev (Ukraine) still during Itamar's 
administration. Franco has already authorized the new embassy, 
the only outstanding matter is the decree to create 
it. 
  -  Mercosur: Brazil is actively helping to intensify trade 
relations between Mercosur and the EU. Celso Amorim has said 
relations with France are intensifying. "I was the first Latin 
American personality to address the French Senate," said the 
minister who was also the first Brazilian Foreign Minister to 
visit the reunified Germany.

  [Text] Brasilia -- The Strategic Affairs Secretariat (SAE) 
has produced reports for President Itamar Franco informing that 
the Landless People's Movement (MST) is very well coordinated, 
and that it even has training centers for the political and 
ideological formation of its leaders. According to the reports 
made available to O ESTADO, one of those centers is located at 
the Ranch of Workers in the town of Ipojuca, in rural 
Pernambuco, where landless people might be receiving guerrilla 
training for the purpose of guaranteeing the possession of 
occupied areas. 
  The reports are divided into one main section and its 
annexes, all of them bearing the "confidential" seal. The 
reports say that representatives from Germany, Chile, Nicaragua, 
Cuba, and the former USSR are cooperating in the training of 
landless people. They add that the MST is linked with Latin 
American and Caribbean peasant organizations, and that it also 
has links in Chile, Uruguay, El Salvador, and Nicaragua. 
  One 15-page SAE report says that MST leaders have 
transformed 
the action into a movement of masses supporting political and 
ideological interests that are against the government and the 
system of government. The document emphasizes the participation 
of the Workers Party (PT) and the Sole Workers Center (CUT), 
noting that the two organizations consider landless people their 
main force in promoting conflict in the field. 
  The document says that the MST is like a military 
organization, having pamphlets with instructions for land 
occupation, resistance, and for the promotion of production in 
the occupied area in order to guarantee possession of the land. 
The document reveals that women and children are also 
instructed to resist, that landless peasants intend to build 
guerrilla bases in the Bico do Papagaio region, in Tocantins, 
and that while they were planning their action they proposed 
building homemade bombs. They are said to be heavily armed, but 
no reference is made to the weapons they have. 
  PT Deputy for Sao Paulo Luci Choinacki, who backs the Sao 
Paulo landless people, has questioned the contents of the 
report: "The movement has no political-partisan motivation, and 
envisages the fight for land as being for the sake of the 
workers' survival." She added that "the land conflict in Brazil 
has neither increased nor decreased over the past few years. It 
is exactly the same." "Because we are in an electoral year, the 
information is being used for electoral purposes," she said. 
  The PT deputy said that none of the 100,000 settlements were 
made out of the government's own will, but through the workers' 
struggle. She suggested that the government investigate those 
settlements to see that productivity has increased in those 
areas. She also proposed to check the work done by the Rural 
Democratic Union (UDR) to confirm the number of anonymous 
workers who were killed in armed conflicts. She denied that the 
movement is promoting any type of guerrilla training. 
  PT Deputy for Sao Paulo Jose Genoino, a member of the 
Defense 
Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, will next week ask SAE 
chief Admiral Mario Flores for a public audience with the 
members of the committee for them to learn about the reports' 
contents. "It is necessary to know what is partial and what is 
impartial in those reports," he said. 
  In order to obtain the information for the reports submitted 
to President Itamar Franco, SAE did the work that was previously 
done by the former agents of the defunct National Intelligence 
Service (SNI). To this end, SAE infiltrated the landless 
movements with its agents, who are supplying the government with 
new information every 15 days, and if necessary every week. SAE 
has not reported how many men are involved in this job. 
  The report describes the factors that gave rise to the 
movement. One of the highlights is the landless people's slogan: 
"The need for implementation of a revolution of workers to 
terminate the capitalist state, which is responsible for the 
current exploitation and misery of workers, reaching Socialism." 
  The document makes a thorough evaluation of land invasions 
in 
Brazil. It says that 122 occupations occurred this year. In 
Sao Paulo, for example, there were 20 actions by landless 
people. Parana is another main target, with 33 invasions. The 
report adds that no land conflicts have occurred in Goias and in 
most Amazonian states, despite the low productivity of land. 
The report notes that the MST is organized in almost all 
states, with the exception of Amazonas and Acre. 
  Concerning PT influence on the movements, the document 
emphasizes that "the PT has considerable power within the 
movement, even within the Coordination Faction, which partially 
disagrees with the political-ideological position of the 
revolutionaries." 
  In its conclusions the document says that the government 
position is not to negotiate under pressure. One of the 
recommendations is the adoption of measures that were planned 
for the farm sector, providing infrastructure to settlements and 
selecting families with devotion to farm work, to give them 
technological and community work orientation.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Brazil monitored through 2 
June. 
  The Securities and Exchange Commission has authorized GAZETA 
MERCANTIL to issue $23 million worth of shares, which makes it 
the first Brazilian media company with open capital. (Sao Paulo 
GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 26 May 94 p 1) 
  A study carried out by Atlantic Rating, of the Atlantic 
Capital consultant group, concludes that practically all 
Brazilian banks will record losses in July following the 
implementation of the real. This will happen mainly because they 
will have to change their applications, which are currently 
concentrated on profitable but inflationary federal public 
notes. One bank is considering a reduction of its personnel by 
20 percent, while state banks are expecting a Central Bank 
measure to save them. About half of the 51 banks studied so far 
closed their 1993 balance with a portfolio of debts in arrears 
from borrowing clients that is above the desirable international 
standard of an average 1 percent. The Rio Grande do Sul State 
Bank, Banrisul, closed its balance with 9.89 percent of 
borrowers' debts in arrears. The Bank of Brazil has 8.13 
percent, Sao Paulo State Bank, Banespa, has 4.22 percent, and 
the General Commerce Bank has 3.2 percent. Assets in loans to 
clients of 49 of the 51 banks studied are below 70 percent, 
which is the ideal figure for an economically stable country. 
(Sao Paulo FOLHA DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 27 May 94 S1 p 8) 
  Sao Paulo industrial sales dropped by 12.4 percent in April 
compared with March. This means the Industrial Activity Index 
measured by the Sao Paulo State Federation of Industries, FIESP, 
and the Sao Paulo State Industries Center, CIESP, dropped by 4.2 
percent during the same period and that the installed productive 
capability dropped from 76.9 percent in March to 75.2 percent in 
April. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 27 May 94 p 11) 
  The Getulio Vargas Foundation and the Brazilian Capital 
Market Institute, Ibmec, have reported that the Rio Grande do 
Sul Airline, Varig, has accumulated losses of $614.5 million 
since 1991. Varig is the only Brazilian airline with a positive 
net patrimony that amounts to $486 million. It increased its 
operational net sales by 17.6 percent, which was equivalent to 
$2.44 billion in 1993. Varig's financial losses in 1993 amount 
to $286 million, and it has announced it will reduce its fleet 
and dismiss employees. The Sao Paulo Airline, VASP, and 
Transbrasil have lost together nearly $1 billion since the 
Cruzado Plan was implemented in 1986. Although VASP had an 
operational profit of $40 million in 1993, its debts made its 
final balance negative. VASP reduced its fleet from 59 aircraft 
in 1992 to 28 in 1993. It it reduced its staff from 7071 to 
5358 employees during the same period. Transbrasil reduced its 
financial loss from $128 million in 1992 to $63 million in 1993. 
It reported an operational loss of $69 million in 1993. 
Transbrasil's debts amounted to $156 million in 1993. (Rio de 
Janeiro O GLOBO in Portuguese 31 May 94 p26) 
  The National Gas Distributing Companies Union, Sindigas, 
has reported that liquefied petroleum gas sales amounted to 
450,310 tonnes in April, 4.6 percent up on the volume sold 
during the same month last year. Compared with March this year, 
sales dropped by 1 percent. The accumulated gas sales during 
the first four months of the year amounted to 1.71 million 
tonnes, a 2.3 percent up on the same period last year. Sindigas 
says this growth follows the minimum population growth. (Sao 
Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 30 May 94 p14) 
  The Brazilian Aeronautics Company, Embraer, has registered 
its greatest quarterly loss in its history; $18.9 million. This 
follows the crisis in the international aircraft market. The 
Embraer management believes this negative balance will not 
affect the company's privatization auction that will take place 
on 4 August. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 1516 GMT 1 
Jun 94) 
  Brazilian Petroleum Corporation, Petrobras, today reported 
that it has closed the first quarter with a $23 million profit, 
$59 million less the $82 million earned during the same period 
last year. Petrobras attributed this drop to a price reduction 
from $16.66 per barrel in December 1993 to $15.76 in March this 
year. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2343 GMT 1 Jun 94) 
  For the first time since March 1990, the National Treasury 
has auctioned Treasury Bonds, LFT, restoring them as part of the 
public debt composition. Of the $7 billion worth of LFT's 
offered yesterday nearly $2.5 billion were sold. Most of the 
buyers were investment funds administering banks. LFT's are 
interesting for funds that need to renew their portfolios during 
the transition into the real because their profitability is 
guaranteed since they earn the overnight market interest rate. 
LFT's with maturity dates in March and May 1995 were the only 
ones sold, while the others with longer maturity terms remained 
unattractive. The government also offered the first parcel of 
National Treasury Notes, NTN, in Real Value Unit, URV, on the 
market. It sold 2.05 million NTN papers. They pay 40.9 percent 
interest per year or 2.90 percent per month. This is slightly 
above the 2.75 percent real interest rate paid by the overnight 
market. (Rio de Janeiro O GLOBO in Portuguese 1 Jun 94) 
  The Espirito Santo State Government has temporarily 
postponed 
the auction of 20.7 percent of its shares in the Espirito Santo 
Power Plants, Inc., Escelsa, which was to have been held on 21 
May at the Rio de Janeiro Stock exchange. It was postponed to 
give eight national and foreign investors more time to evaluate 
the situation. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2307 GMT 
31 May 94)

<F P=106> [Article by Maria Helena Tachinardi] </F>
  [Text] Sao Paulo -- The developed countries are expected to 
promote a debate on the social question, which ranges from 
salary policy and labor conditions to the treatment of needy 
children, within the new World Trade Organization (WTO). 
Foreign Minister Celso Amorim believes that if this happens, 
and if new rules are imposed on countries having cheap labor, a 
new form of protectionism would have been created. 
  Speaking at the seminar entitled "New World Trade Map" 
sponsored by this newspaper, Amorim said: "Instead of 
contributing to improving social conditions in developing 
countries, this would result in rich countries exporting 
unemployment to poor countries; that is, in the former 
transferring to the latter an untenable social burden." 
  This new method of pressure known as social "dumping" is one 
of the new issues raised at the end of the Uruguay Round of GATT 
negotiations. Trade issues concerning the environment, and 
policies on competition (rules governing competition among 
countries) are other topics that are emerging on the new agenda 
through the pressure exerted by the developed countries. 
  Ambassador Luiz Felipe Lampreia, the Brazilian 
representative 
to GATT, has contended that the WTO is not the appropriate forum 
to discuss either the social "dumping" issue or the connections 
between trade and labor standards. He said: "The International 
Labor Organization (ILO) has already concluded 200 conventions 
regarding this issue." Lampreia conveyed the Brazilian 
Government's concern over the possibility that the WTO might 
become a politicized organization "for reasons other than 
trade." He noted that the WTO could become politicized "if it 
carelessly introduces the social clause." 
  Lampreia chairs a GATT committee charged with studying the 
links between trade and the environment. The committee is due 
to propose to the WTO two years from now "the course of action 
to take" regarding this matter. The Brazilian Government is 
concerned about our exports of paper, cellulose, and shrimp, 
which have been threatened by ecological measures with 
underlying trade motives. 
  In the case of shrimp, Brazil had to sign an accord with the 
United States whereby Brazilian shrimp boats will be equipped 
with devices to avoid catching sea turtles. 
  Brazil signed the accord without reservations. It should 
have made the above requirement applicable only to fishermen 
operating in the northern part of the country, who are the main 
exporters of shrimp to the United States, thus exempting 
fishermen operating in southern areas, who are now complaining 
about this restriction. 
  Mexico, a major exporter of this product to the U.S. market, 
has had to conform to U.S. legal requirements designed to 
prevent the catching of dolphins. 
  Another controversial issue at this time of transition from 
GATT to the WTO deals with restrictive trade practices used by 
some companies in their international transactions. 
  Amorim said: "This is an old claim by developing countries 
that has now been compounded by the growing attention developed 
countries are devoting to competition policies. In a globalized 
economy, this type of practice could annul the liberalization 
efforts made by some governments. This possibility has in fact 
been recognized in the Uruguay Round accord on services and 
intellectual property rights." 
  Jesus Seade, deputy director general of GATT, who also 
attended the seminar, said: "The challenges are enormous. The 
Organization for Cooperation and Economic Development (OECD) is 
working in this. The GATT member countries have no modern laws 
on competition. Many practices do not encourage competition." 
  According to the foreign minister, it is a mistake to 
believe 
that governments and unions are united on the social "dumping" 
issue because unions are inclined to favor higher salaries. 
  Ambassador Julio Antonio Lacarte, "chairman" of the Group of 
Negotiations and Settlement of Disputes of the Uruguay Round, 
said that operating under the WTO umbrella will be an 
organization charged with settling controversies ("Dispute 
Settlement Body" -- DSB), which will deal with disputes 
concerning each accord of the final Uruguay Round agreement. 
The DSB will be empowered to set up "panels" (arbitration 
committees), will monitor the implementation of rules and 
recommendations, and will authorize retaliatory measures if the 
recommendations are not observed. This is a step forward in 
relation to GATT, because the mechanisms for settling 
controversies there is spread out among the GATT Council and 
several committees created by the Tokyo Round. 
  For the first time GATT has also adopted the notion of 
processing and production methods. Imports will now have to go 
through a process designed to determine how the imported product 
has been manufactured.

  [Excerpts] Santiago, 2 Jun (EFE) -- Several Chilean 
deputies from the Coalition of Parties for Democracy, which is 
currently in power, have submitted a bill asking that Congress 
request from the Defense Ministry a report on the trip made by 
Army Commander General Augusto Pinochet to the Czech Republic. 
  Congressional sources said today that the report will have 
to 
give all the details of the purpose of Gen. Pinochet's trip, a 
list of all the members of his delegation, the cost of the trip, 
and its financing. 
  According to the sources, the bill will be voted on next 
week. Some of the deputies who signed the bill said that 
Pinochet's trip abroad does not do Chilean democracy any good. 
[passage omitted] 
  Socialist Deputy Jaime Naranjo said that the problems 
encountered by Pinochet abroad--before arriving in Prague he was 
told to leave a hotel in Amsterdam--shows that Pinochet should 
not continue as Army chief. 
  All of these events abroad "only discredit the country" said 
Naranjo, in comments published by LA NACION. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Santiago, 1 Jun (EFE) -- Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres emphasized in the Chilean capital today that in a 
war there is no other alternative but to win, while in peacetime 
there are the alternatives of negotiation and reaching agreement. 
  During an official visit to Chile, Peres discussed in the 
Chilean Chamber of Deputies the Middle East peace process. 
  In his speech the Israeli minister stressed that his country 
has chosen peace, and has engaged in the quest for the required 
agreements with the Palestinians. He added that after the 
historic agreements that have been achieved, Israel hopes to do 
the same with its Arab neighbors. 
  Shim'on Peres emphasized that it is necessary for all 
nations 
to support the peace process, which is "the only way to build a 
new Middle East." 
  In his visit to the Chilean Congress, in the port of 
Valparaiso 125 km west of Santiago, Peres also met Senate 
President Gabriel Valdes and Chamber of Deputies President Jorge 
Schaulsohn. 
  Peres's visit to Chile was the last leg of a Latin American 
tour that also included Mexico and Colombia. Peres returned to 
his country today. The tour is part of the Israeli authorities' 
policy of enhancing ties with Latin America. According to Peres, 
the Israeli authorities view Latin America as having great 
economic and trade potential. 
  During his visit Peres engaged in many activities, including 
a meeting with President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle and working 
meetings with Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa, Defense Minister 
Edmundo Perez Yoma, and Agriculture Ministry officials. 
  Before visiting Congress, Peres met with Chilean 
entrepreneurs, with whom he reviewed the possibilities of 
increasing trade and mutual investment. 
  After his arrival on 31 May, Peres held a news conference in 
which he confirmed Israel's decision to pursue the Middle East 
peace talks. He announced that after the agreement reached with 
the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), these talks would 
be pursued with Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon. 
  The Israeli minister expressed his optimism over the 
Palestinian process of autonomy in Gaza and Jericho. 
Nevertheless, he described as "painful and old-fashioned" the 
language recently used by PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat, and his 
hints at a "holy war." 
  Peres stressed that the PLO is not now carrying out any 
terrorist actions. He said he trusts this situation will not be 
reversed. Peres emphasized that, in the long agenda that is 
still pending, "the wind is blowing favorably." 
  Shim'on Peres and his Chilean counterpart, Carlos Figueroa, 
signed an agreement removing the visa requirement for the two 
countries. This agreement will especially facilitate the visits 
of entrepreneurs. Visits by entrepreneurs and bilateral trade 
have both increased. 
  According to official figures, in the past two years Chilean 
exports to Israel grew from $5.3 million in 1992 to $13.6 
million in 1993, a trend that remains unchanged. 
  Peres offered his country's full cooperation for a program 
to 
reclaim desert land in northern Chile and for technological and 
scientific transfers.

  [Excerpt] Santiago, 2 Jun (EFE) -- Several Chilean 
authorities and business sector leaders agreed today that 
persistently high inflation rates, increased unemployment rates, 
and a drop in investments are causing concern within the Chilean 
Government and the private sector. 
  Data disclosed on 1 June by the National Statistics 
Institute 
(INE) shows that the annual inflation rate remains at 12.7 
percent, following a rise of 1.4 percent in May, while 
unemployment rose to 5.3 percent; a 0.9 percent increase over 
the past 12 months. 
  All this, in addition to a growth of only 3.4 percent of the 
GDP during the first quarter and a persistent drop in the 
exchange rate, makes businessmen fear that the economic 
adjustment the government has been implementing for the past 
year may became negative and that the Chilean economy may slow 
down. 
  Chilean Economy Under Secretary Carlos Mladinic asserted 
that 
these figures reveal that the struggle to curb inflation--one of 
the government's main objectives and the main reason for the 
adjustment--is not easy and demands great discipline and 
austerity in public and private expenditures. 
  Mladinic denied that the Chilean economy has been 
drastically 
over-adjusted, adding that it is only "logical" that the 
measures to reduce expenditures would increase the unemployment 
rate. 
  Mladinic added that the government is maintaining its goal 
of 
an inflation rate not higher than 11 percent for this year.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Chile monitored through 2 June. 
  A public sector and private business commission will visit 
the PRC between 25 and 31 May and then go to Hong Kong to 
promote commercial relations. The negotiations will be conducted 
by Chilean exporters. The delegation will be headed by Economy 
Minister Alvaro Garcia and by Exporters Association President 
Ronald Bown. Chilean exports to PRC last year totalled $183.5 
million, while imports totaled $212.5 million. (Santiago LA 
TERCERA DE LA HORA in Spanish 21 May 94 p 5) 
  The Chilean Exporters Association reported that 122,063,885 
boxes of fruits were exported during the 1993-1994 season, up by 
3.5 percent compared with the previous season. The United States 
is the leading importer with $49.8 million worth of fruit, while 
Europe imported $46.8 million worth. (Santiago EL MERCURIO in 
Spanish 21 May 94 pp 1, 23) 
  The Chilean and Venezuelan trade balance has been 
unfavorable 
for Chile since the economic complementation accord was enforced 
in April 1993. The Central Bank of Chile reported that exports 
to that country dropped by 6.2 percent between July and December 
1993, and by 5.8 percent during the first quarter of this year, 
when sales totalled $14.5 million. The trade balance registered 
a $68-million deficit in 1993 following the purchase of oil and 
heating oil. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 1458 GMT 25 May 94) 
  The Central Bank of Chile on 22 May reported that Chilean 
foreign investments rose $188.8 million in the first four months 
of the year. The biggest investments were made in Panama--$215.5 
million; Argentina--$61 million; and Peru--$33.7 million. The 
cumulated foreign investment was $1,233 billion from 1975 to 
April 1994 (Santiago EL MERCURIO in Spanish 23 May 94 pp B1-B2) 
  Preliminary figures released by the Central Bank of Chile 
show the GDP increased 3.4 percent during the first quarter of 
the year. Fishing registered the highest increase with 21.3 
percent; transport and communications, 8.1 percent; industry, 
5.5 percent; electricity, gas, and water, 5 percent; financial 
services, 4.3 percent; and personal services, including 
education and public and private health, 3.4 percent. Mining 
activities dropped by 0.7 percent and forestry activities 
dropped by 0.5 percent. (Santiago EL MERCURIO in Spanish 24 May 
94 pp A1-A12)

  [Text] Santiago, 1 Jun (EFE) -- The Manuel Rodriguez 
Patriotic Movement (MPMR), which abandoned the armed struggle in 
1990, has asked the government of President Eduardo Frei for a 
draft law to allow 300 of its militants to be exempt from 
judicial proceedings. 
  MPMR leaders announced they will create an Orientation 
Office 
to gather information on "the situation of the militants living 
clandestinely." 
  The announcement was made through a document released today 
entitled "For the Normalization of the Life of Militants Who 
Fought Against the Dictatorship" which is signed by leaders 
Leandro Torchio, Cesar Quiroz, and Marcos Riquelme. 
  The document says that 34 MPMR of a total of 50 militants 
who 
escaped from jail under the Pinochet regime are living 
clandestinely and that another 270 are wanted by the law. 
  "There are about 300 militants who did not go through 
Pinochet's jails and who are being persecuted" said the leaders 
of the MPMR--which is a splinter group of the Manuel Rodriguez 
Patriotic Front (FPMR)--who in 1990 decided to join the 
democratic life. 
  The FPMR, which was created in 1984, decided to continue the 
armed struggle during the democratic government of Patricio 
Aylwin (1990-1994) who was accused of continuing the military 
policy. 
  The MPMR leaders believe it is necessary to legislate on the 
situation of those who struggled against the military regime and 
to establish the provisional release of those who have appeared 
in court to resolve their situation. 
  They also recalled that the militants fought against a 
regime 
that was condemned for 17 years by the United Nations for 
serious human right violations. They added that these people 
only committed the crime of "not yielding in their struggle for 
democracy." 
  The MPMR confirmed that Sergio Buschmann, actor and fugitive 
from justice who escaped from a Chilean jail in 1987, will 
return to Chile on 15 June accompanied by a U.S. lawyer. 
  Buschmann was arrested by the military regime for running a 
covert operation to introduce an arms shipment in Chile in 1976. 
  Buschmann lives in Nicaragua and has decided to return to 
Chile to face a trial which he hopes will create awareness over 
the situation of the so-called former members of the resistance 
against the dictatorship.

  [Text] Yesterday, Central Reserve Bank [BCR] President 
German Suarez reported that "to prevent the nominal exchange 
rate from dropping, $700 million has been bought from the black 
market so far this year, $300 million of which was for the 
executive branch, while the remaining $400 million was for the 
BCR." 
  He added that the $400 million purchased by the BCR almost 
doubles the amount that was purchased last year, and that this 
means that the bank is always striving to improve the exchange 
rate parity, in order to avoid causing big losses to the export 
sector. 
  Suarez noted that international reserves stand at 
approximately $4.6 billion, and that this amount includes the 
income of currency from the sale of Peruvian Telephone Company 
and National Telecommunications Enterprise. "If we exclude this 
operation, reserves stand at $3.2 billion," he said. 
  During a brief explanation to the Budget Committee, which 
summoned Suarez and Economy Minister Jorge Camet to explain the 
targets that the Letter of Intent registered for their sector, 
the BCR president said the exchange rate lag stood at 
approximately 15 percent. 
  He said that if the inflow of foreign capital for investment 
grows, the exchange rate lag could also grow. "Colombia and 
Argentina are experiencing the same foreign capital growth, and 
their exchange rate lag stands at 16 and 40 percent, 
respectively," he said. 
<H5>  Legal Bank Reserves </H5>
  Concerning legal bank reserves, Suarez said additional 
reserves covering foreign currency deposits will not be reduced 
until confidence in the national currency improves. "Dollar 
deposits still account for 70 percent of bank deposits," he said. 
  Concerning expectations over an exchange rate increase, 
Camet 
said the budget provided for an overestimated exchange rate of 
2.7 new soles to the dollar for the end of the year. "The wisest 
figure was given by the BCR calculation, which indicated 2.43 
new soles to the dollar at the end of the year," he emphasized. 
  Economic analysts have said that the purchase of foreign 
currency by the BCR will have a slight effect this month because 
enterprises will need dollars in May to meet time-in-service 
compensation (CTS) requirements. As is known, most employees 
have chosen this type of dollar deposit.

  [Text] The current Shining Path [SL] leadership is headed 
by several regional leaders, among them Oscar Ramirez Durand, 
also known as "Feliciano," who has great influence but not 
absolute power, according to Dincote [National Counterterrorism 
Directorate]. 
  This information was granted by Felipe Tenorio Barbaran, 
also 
known as "Albino," who was arrested a few days ago in Huacho 
together with other SL members whose identities have still not 
been revealed. "Albino," according to the Dincote spokesman, 
also disclosed that he had belonged to that elite SL group. 
  Tenorio Barbaran asserted that "Feliciano" is not the only 
leader of this unruly faction, but it has still not been 
determined who the other leaders of the group's so-called 
"collegiate presidency" are. 
  This SL faction is against the peace agreement upheld by 
Abimael Guzman Reinoso. 
  "Albino" also admitted having been a leader of the so-called 
North Zone Committee (Barranca-Huacho) and the intellectual 
author of attacks perpetrated by the SL in the zone between the 
years 1990-93. 
  After being named a member of the SL Central Committee, he 
was invited to the capital to plan the attacks they would 
perpetrate. At that time, he appeared in a video, together with 
Guzman, dancing Zorba the Greek. 
  Felipe Tenorio Barbaran, in his capacity as SL chief in the 
northern zone, shared the leadership with Daniel Angel Ramirez 
Martel, aka "Oscar," who was arrested last year together with 
another nine terrorists of the zone. 
  Between the years 1990 and 1993, they perpetrated some 30 
selective murders against mayors of different towns, policemen, 
civilians, an Air Force general, and three Japanese engineers. 
Among their victims are Air Force General Julian Olivera Angeles 
and the engineer Javier Puigross Planas.

  [Text] According to a reliable judicial source, General 
Jaime Rios Arayco said, in his testimony before Judge Gloria 
Arteaga Lucas: "I am only a scapegoat. The real protectors of 
`Vaticano' are other people, and some of them were rewarded with 
appointments abroad." 
  Gen. Rios admitted, however, that Demetrio Chavez 
Penaherrera 
["Vaticano"] virtually fed the troops deployed in his area of 
operations by giving them money and other donations. 
  In his testimony Gen. Rios said: "At that time, we did not 
know he was a drug trafficker. Everyone knew him as a prosperous 
businessman, some kind of generous patron." 
  Gen. Rios and the other officers accused of covering up drug 
trafficking and allowing corruption are being held on Punta 
Lobos Island, Pucusana, in charge of Air Force personnel. 
  Gen. Frank Tweddle Granda, who was sentenced to 15 years in 
prison for drug trafficking, was also held there from 1980 to 
1981. 
  According to the accusations, Gen. Jaime Rios Arayco and the 
other officers did not take any measures during their stay on 
the Huallaga Front to repress the criminal activities of 
Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, "Vaticano," and his gang. On the 
contrary, they had friendly contact with him and received 
"donations" on several occasions. 
  It is even said that Gen. Rios personally prevented the 
capture of some of "Vaticano's" agents, and reprimanded the 
policemen who carried out antidrug operations against his 
consent and authorization. 
  In this regard, Gen. Rios told Judge Gloria Arteaga that the 
accusations are not true, and that he has become "a scapegoat" 
to hide the real protectors of drug trafficking, some of whom 
"have been rewarded with appointments abroad." 
  Apparently Rios was referring to Gen. Eduardo Bellido Mora, 
brother-in-law of Army Commander General Nicolas de Bari Hermoza 
Rios. According to various reports, including the comments of 
Major Evaristo Castillo Aste, Bellido Mora has been mentioned as 
one of the "protectors" of Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera. Bellido 
is currently the Peruvian military attache in Israel. 
  It was learned from judicial sources that the other officers 
who were also accused with Gen. Rios Arayco have basically 
agreed with their chief on the Huallaga Front that Demetrio 
Chavez virtually fed the Army Command, donating money to feed 
the troops deployed in that zone to fight drug trafficking and 
terrorism. But according to their instructions, they were not 
aware Chavez was a drug trafficker. 
  Regarding this case, it was learned yesterday that the judge 
of the 42d Criminal Court will ask the president of the Lima 
Superior Court to add the accusations under investigation in the 
47th Criminal Court to the one he, Judge Alzamora, has been 
investigating for months against the main suspect, Demetrio 
Chavez Penaherrera, "Vaticano." 
  A judicial spokesman said the combination of the cases would 
be appropriate as they deal with the same charges against 
"Vaticano," for the sake of economy in the legal process, and 
because events of the same nature, and against the same people, 
cannot be separated. 
  It was reported by judicial sources that Judge Gloria 
Arteaga 
has scheduled for next week new testimony by Gen. Rios Arayco 
and the other officers.

  [Text] Lima, 27 May (EFE) -- Lima Mayor Ricardo Belmont, 
who is an independent, today announced his candidacy for the 
presidency of Peru for the 1995 general elections. 
  During a news conference, Belmont said his decision is a 
result of "a deep reflection that leads me as a Peruvian to 
follow my conscience." He said: "There is no way back, the 
speculations are over. I will run as an independent, without 
alliances with any groups." 
  Belmont referred to Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori who, 
according to all political observers, will run for a reelection 
and whom Belmont has described as "promoting the division, not 
the unity of the Peruvian people." 
  Belmont is complying with a second term as Lima mayor after 
being reelected last January. He said he has not yet begun his 
campaign and that he will totally engage in a campaign "once the 
game rules are clear." 
  "No matter what the polls, Congress, or the media say, 
Belmont will run in the elections," said Belmont, founder and 
leader of Obras political movement. 
  Last month, he announced he would not run although some 
sectors considered him a probable candidate. 
  The Lima mayor became one of the harshest critics of 
President Fujimori after the government passed a law cutting 
municipal income which, according to Belmont, prevents him from 
implementing more than a dozen works he considers essential for 
Lima. 
  Opposition members considered the law seeks to neutralize 
Belmont's capability of action as mayor and to prevent him from 
carrying out works that would allow him to gain support for a 
probable presidential campaign. 
  Cusco Mayor Luis Caceres has also announced his candidacy 
for 
the presidency. According to the polls, former United Nations 
Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar is Fujimori's 
strongest contender if he decides to run. Perez de Cuellar has 
said it is too early to decide.

<F P=106> [Interview with Government Minister Fabio Villegas by </F>
Ricardo Canon at the Presidential Palace in Santa Fe de Bogota; 
from the "Midday Television Newscast" -- live] 
  [Text] [Canon] A ceremony has just concluded here at the 
Presidential Palace -- a ceremony in which President Cesar 
Gaviria ratified the Statutory Law on Exceptional Conditions, 
which makes it possible for the government to deal with certain 
unusual situations. Here is Government Minister Fabio Villegas. 
Mr. Minister, looking into the future, what does this law mean 
for upcoming administrations? 
  [Villegas] For the first time in the history of the nation, 
the nature of the special powers available to the executive in 
times of crisis has been spelled out. There is now a balance 
between state powers in restoring normalcy and successfully 
dealing with these situations and the respect for the rights of 
all Colombians. 
  [Canon] Does this mean that the state of exceptional 
measures, which was used before this law was enacted, has been 
rendered obsolete? 
  [Villegas] The state of exceptional measures, at least as we 
knew it in the past, has disappeared from the country's life and 
juridical order. We now have the power to handle crises and to 
preserve social peace, but with controls and limitations clearly 
established by this new law.

  [Text] Approximately 30 days after the Constitutional Court 
[CC] legalized personal drug use, yesterday, the government 
issued a decree aimed at strengthening essential prevention 
programs and restricting drug consumption and possession in the 
country. 
  Workers will immediately be fired upon proof of drug 
consumption, and professionals will lose their practicing 
licenses. Likewise, yesterday, the government yesterday minors 
and pregnant and nursing women from consuming and possessing 
drugs. It also forbad the use of psychotropic substances at 
elementary and high schools, malls, restaurants, bars, night 
clubs, taverns, recreation centers, and all public places in 
general. 
  All education centers nationwide were granted a 30-day 
period 
to adopt the necessary measures to curb drug consumption in any 
of its forms as part of their internal statutes. The government 
also banned drug consumption in all sports activities in the 
country. The same measure applies to prisons, businesses, and 
other workplaces. 
  According to the decree, those who violate restrictions on 
drug consumption could be admonished, fined, and even expelled 
from where they are, whether a school or a public place. In 
addition, the government decided those who are caught driving a 
vehicle while under the influence of drugs could be detained by 
authorities for a period of up to 24 hours and sentenced to pay 
a minimum of up to 20 salaries. In addition, their driver 
licenses could even be suspended. 
  Last night, Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez said: "Drug 
consumption is not a basic right, but we are warning the 
objective of the decree is merely to establish certain 
restrictions to the CC ruling rather than challenging it." Those 
laws that penalize drug sales, trafficking, production, and 
distribution within the country are in effect, and the 
government will not hesitate to enforce them against those who 
violate them. 
  Meanwhile, Drug Director Gabriel de Vega Pinzon has said 
strategies of integral production against drug addiction will be 
reinforced to protect the people's basic rights, which could be 
affected by drug problems. He added that within the framework 
of antidrug strategies, we are progressing in tangible 
prevention and rehabilitation programs in Medellin, Atlantico, 
Caldas, Cali, Huila, and Santander. 
<H5>  Restrictions </H5>
  The decree prohibits drug possession, trafficking, and 
consumption in the country's public and private schools. School 
officials will be in charge of reporting cases of drug 
possession and consumption. In case minors are caught with 
drugs, school officials will notify their parents. Student 
penalties could range from admonition to expulsion, including 
suspension. Moreover, all schools will include drug prevention 
subjects in their curriculum. 
  Governors and mayors, with the coordination of the Education 
Ministry, will verify the development of prevention programs at 
schools and impose pertinent disciplinary measures.

Council of State president, and the prosecutor general of the

  [Text] Meeting in Santa Fe de Bogota today, 27 May 1994, 
and taking into account the need to uphold and reaffirm one of 
the fundamental principles of the state of law, we declare: 
  First -- The normal functions of democratic institutions 
impose absolute respect to the constitutional principle that 
establishes the separation of state branches, legislative, 
executive, and judicial. Anything that infers a disavowal of 
the independence of one of those branches is against the 
Constitution. 
  Second -- We reaffirm, now and always, the judicial branch's 
independence and ability to act in accordance with the exclusive 
authority the Constitution assigns to it. We praise the respect 
and observance used to express disagreement with one of its 
decisions which, although debatable, must not be attacked by 
turning the public against the institution that dictated it, as 
has been done by certain government officials whom the 
Constitution and the law have not given such attributes. 
  Third -- The Constitution includes its reform and the 
mechanisms to be used to this end. Institutional stability is 
not furthered when each time an authorized judicial branch 
official makes a decision that does not satisfy certain 
interests, proposals to change the Constitution are made so as 
to invalidate the decision. 
  [Signed] Constitutional Court President Jorge Arango Mejia, 
Council of State President Amado Gutierrez, and Prosecutor 
General of the Republic Gustavo de Greiff Restrepo.

  [Text] Democracy was not the only protagonist on 29 May. 
Peace was too, and it arrived on board a plane hoping for a 
better future, and this was the message Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shimon Peres brought with him. 
  Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin, accompanied by a large 
delegation of the Jewish and Palestinian communities residing in 
the Colombian capital, received Peres at Catam Military Airport 
in western Santa Fe de Bogota. 
  Peres, on a brief tour of Latin America that includes only 
Mexico, Colombia, and Chile, will discuss topics such as 
economic rapprochement and technological cooperation with 
Colombian officials. The topic of peace predominated, however, 
during the foreign minister's news conference at the Catam 
runway. 
  The Colombian foreign minister said: "Peres is a protagonist 
of peace. Colombia must pay homage to him for his efforts and 
the success he has had in both this first chapter of peace 
between Israel and the Palestinians and for everything he is 
doing in the Middle East, as an example to the world on how 
peace should be made." 
  Peres stressed the importance of the democratic process he 
witnessed upon his arrival. "Colombia, despite the bad press, 
has always been a country that is stronger due to its votes 
rather than its bullets. I am certain the results of today's 
elections will allow it to continue down the path of economic 
recovery and growth in other sectors." 
  "Just as you are doing, we are trying to consolidate peace 
among our people and in our region. In Israeli, we are 
determined to continue with the upcoming chapters of peace in 
the process we have begun," Peres said. 
  With contagious optimism, the Israeli foreign minister 
expressed his conviction the peace being built in the Middle 
East will be a solid and lasting one. "I believe the entire 
world is progressing from a history of wars to the creation of 
peace. Nothing that is important in life can be achieved 
through war. What can be achieved through war has ceased to be 
important," he added. 
  According to the foreign minister, the step that was taken 
with the implementation of the Palestinian autonomies in the 
Gaza Strip and the Cisjordanian city of Jericho, as established 
in the declaration signed by the Palestine Liberation 
Organization (PLO) and Israel in Washington last September, is 
irreversible. "I believe we are deeply interested in securing 
peace for our children. We are tired of war. Neither side has 
achieved anything by military means," he said. The peace 
process in the Middle East is loaded with obstacles, however. 
Perez' view is pragmatic. 
  Asked about the statement by PLO President Yasir 'Arafat 
about the recent call for a "holy war" for the liberation of 
Jerusalem, Peres said actions are far more important than words, 
adding "we are satisfied that despite Arafat's statements he has 
continued to fulfill our agreement." 
  Peres emphatically said: "Jerusalem will remain a united 
city, the capital of Israel. Jerusalem is politically closed 
but religiously open. We are not going to turn it into a 
Berlin, divided in two. It will be open to all religions." 
  Peres anticipated a new era in relations with Catholics and 
Muslims. "We will sign an agreement with the Vatican in 
Jerusalem and exchange ambassadors this year. This was not an 
ordinary political move. It is something that took 1,994 years 
to happen. All of the sacred sites will remain open to all 
religions," he reiterated. 
  For Peres, the key element of the changes that are occurring 
worldwide is the economy. "If one has an adequate economy, one 
obtains adequate results," he said. He affirmed, therefore, 
there will be no peace in Israel if this country remains an 
island of prosperity in a sea of poverty. "We will do 
everything within our means to improve standards of living in 
all parts of the region, not only in Israel." 
  Peres mentioned an economic example of the importance of 
peace in the region. According to him, the Middle East spent 
more than $1 trillion in 10 years to buy bombs. If half this 
amount had been spent on education, the Middle East would be a 
very prosperous region, he said. 
  Peres offered his country's technological assistance to 
Colombia. "We will gladly share whatever experience we have in 
the agricultural field. Israel has improved its agricultural 
production by 1,200 percent in 25 years without water or land." 
  He said Latin America is also experiencing a profound 
transformation, a factor which plays a significant role on the 
world stage. "Colombia, one of the four most important 
countries in Latin America, will play its proper role," he said. 
  Nevertheless, Peres reserved his highest praise for the 
Colombian foreign minister. "We are very happy to improve 
relations between Colombia and Israel. The Colombian foreign 
minister's visit to Israel was very successful. She made a 
magnificent impression on us."

  [Text] Since the Cartagena Agreement on the struggle 
against drug trafficking was signed on 15 February 1990, which 
includes the United States, Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia, never 
has such a tense situation been generated among the signatory 
nations as the one observed last weekend between the United 
States, Colombia, and Peru. 
  One month ago, the Pentagon issued an order to suspend 
operations of the two radars that detect aircraft. These radars 
operate in Colombia as a result of that agreement. The same 
decision was made regarding the radars that operate in Peru. 
  This decision -- labeled by high-ranking Colombian 
Government 
spokespersons as "not consulted, untimely, unilateral, and 
discourteous" -- has not been officially communicated to the 
authorities by the U.S. Government which has preferred to remain 
silent. 
  The incident began on Sunday, 1 May. On that day, the 
Colombian Air Force officer in charge of radar operations in 
Aracuara and Leticia (Amazonas), officially communicated to the 
Defense Ministry that the passing on of information on flights 
from the radars was being suspended by the U.S. military without 
any explication. Since then and to the present, the two 
Colombian radars have not been operating. 
  The order was issued by the Pentagon to the soldiers through 
the U.S. Southern Command in Panama. A high-ranking government 
official said: "The news was baffling although at the beginning 
it was said that the suspension was only for eight days." 
  The following day, a Colombian Government official contacted 
the embassy, which had no official information. At that point, 
President Gaviria decided to request a formal explanation for 
what was happening. That was 28 days ago, and no reply has been 
received as yet. 
  In Colombia, the matter was handled with confidentiality, 
until Sunday, when U.S. daily THE WASHINGTON POST reported that 
Colombia and Peru "would take reprisals" against the United 
States as a result of its decision to suspend operations of the 
four radars. Those "reprisals" would be the decision to ship out 
of the country two 30-year-old radars that were used in the 
Vietnam War and which have been of no use in the struggle 
against drug trafficking for the past month. A government 
spokesman said that of course the removal of the radars would 
also be accompanied by "a cordial invitation" to the U.S. 
soldiers and experts in charge of their maintenance to leave the 
country. No government official has confirmed or denied that 
decision. A government spokesman consulted by EL TIEMPO, 
however, said "it is obvious that if the radars are useless, 
there is no sense in keeping them or their technicians in 
Colombian territory." 
  Meanwhile, the authorities know that drug traffickers' 
illegal flights have been on the rise in the past month due to 
the total absence of control in that Amazon area. This is where 
drugs from Bolivia and Peru enter Colombia. 
  The official report on the illegal flights indicate that in 
1993, in that area, 375 aircraft were detected and up until 1 
May this year, 200 flights were reported. This past month an 
average of one illegal flight per day has been added. 
  The government's final determination on the U.S. decision 
will only be adopted when the United States gives a formal 
explanation of what is occurring. In the meantime, it is only 
known that the suspension of radars operations was decided by 
the Pentagon, apparently without the blessing of the State 
Department or the Justice Department. What some government 
officials fear is that an explanation will never be received, 
therefore Colombia will have to make a decision. 
  Those who are caught driving under the influence of drugs 
or other substances will be sentenced to pay the minimum of 20 
equivalent salaries, and their driver licenses will be suspended 
for up to a year. They will even be arrested for 24 hours, and 
their vehicles will be impounded. 
  Likewise, those who, through a medical examination, are 
found 
addicted to any psychotropic substance will not get their 
licenses renewed, and those who, after obtaining their licenses, 
become addicts or second time offenders in illegal possession of 
ammunition, arms, or explosives will get their licenses revoked. 
  Heads of public offices are authorized to unilaterally 
breach 
work contracts when public employees go to their workplaces 
under the influence of any substance or when they consume or 
incite others to consume drugs in the workplace. 
  Furthermore, all public employees of sound mind are 
forbidden 
from using and consuming drugs and psychotropic substances. 
They will be penalized as stipulated by Decree-Law 2400 of 1968 
and by other regulations that supervise public posts. 
  The consumption of psychotropic substances and drugs is also 
forbidden to those who, due to the nature of their jobs or 
professions, impose risks to others. 
  The Decree includes in this category drivers of any type of 
vehicle, pilots, ship captains, aviation students, flight 
instructors, machinists and operators, doctors, dentists, and 
other health professionals who deal with or tend combustible or 
flammable materials and substances, including explosives, toxic, 
poisonous, corrosive, or radioactive substances, as well as 
those who bear or ship arms, air traffic controllers and 
operators, and all ground plane maintenance and support 
technicians. 
  The violation of these regulations by these professionals 
will lead to the suspension, disqualification, or revocation of 
the license or permit to practice their professions. 
  The family, community, society, and state will be 
responsible 
for promoting or implementing policies geared toward avoiding 
and undermining the causes and consequences of drug consumption. 
  This is why the National Drug Council will have to evaluate 
the scope of the problem and coordinate with other governmental 
institutions projects of prevention and programs that will be 
implemented locally, regionally, and nationally. 
  The country's radio and television stations will also have 
to 
air campaigns aimed at fighting drug trafficking and consumption 
as often and as long as the National Drug Council deems 
convenient. 
  To that effect, the government ordered the council to issue, 
within 30 days, pertinent regulations and asked the 
Communications Ministry to continue to promote and develop 
communication strategies to overcome this problem; besides, the 
Health Ministry, secretariats, and departmental services will 
embark on rehabilitation campaigns and programs at the level of 
their treatment facilities. 
  Finally, public and private employers must conduct permanent 
prevention campaigns to make preventive measures effective, and 
they must let authorities inspect and investigate as needed. 
  Drug use and consumption were banned from public places, 
including theaters and stadiums, as well as ships, planes, 
government offices, restaurants, bars, night clubs, hotels, and 
parks. Managers and directors of public places will be able to 
expel drug consumers. Those public places that allow drug 
consumption will be temporarily closed for up to 30 days. 
  Drugs whose effects enhance athletic performance, reduce 
anxiety, and artificially diminish exhaustion cannot be used in 
any sport activities. Doctors who prescribe these type of 
substances to athletes will no longer be able to practice in the 
country. 
  Those who drive under the influence of drugs will be 
sentenced to pay up to 20 minimum monthly salaries, and their 
driver licenses will be suspended for up to a year. They will 
also be detained for 24 hours. 
  No public or private employee will be able to go to his 
workplace under the influence of drugs or to consume them while 
working. Violating this regulation will cause employers to 
breach his contract. 
  The decree also stipulates prison inmates are forbidden from 
possessing or consuming drugs and psychotropic substances, as 
stipulated by 1993 Law No. 65 of the Penitentiary Code. 
  After medical, psychological, and psychiatric evaluations 
are 
made, prison medical services will include rehabilitation 
treatment for inmates who are consuming psychotropic substances 
to help them recover. This regulation does not exempt them, 
however, from being penalized, as stipulated by the law. 
  Penitentiary and surveillance guard members who are caught 
consuming or possessing drugs or who bring drugs to prisons will 
be fired. Disciplinary measures will be taken as well. 
  From now on, those who request gun licenses will be given a 
psychological and physical aptitude test. In case they are 
found to be drug or psychotropic substance addicts, their 
licenses will be revoked. Furthermore, those who bear arms, 
explosives, or ammunition under the influence of these 
substances will be sentenced to pay up to the minimum of one 
monthly salary, although this does not mean they are exempt from 
disciplinary measures. Second time offenders will have their 
gun licenses permanently revoked as stipulated by Decree 2535 of 
1993. 
  The Minors Protection Code stipulates minors, pregnant or 
nursing women, and those who are considered unstable according 
to the Civil Code are forbidden to consume drugs. The 
regulation indicates women in either one of these two conditions 
or minors who consume drugs will be sent to a family counselor 
who will be able to reprimand the dependent minors' parents, to 
grant custody to a close relative, to place them in a foster 
home or a special protection center, or even to begin procedures 
to adopt neglected minors. 
  These measures are aimed at guaranteeing personal care and 
abating the perils that may threaten minors' health and morale.

  [Text] Defense Minister General Jose Gallardo has announced 
that Red Sun--Puka Inti, in Quechua--an Ecuadoran terrorist 
group similar to Peru's Shining Path Maoist movement, will 
surrender its weapons. This evening we will have very pleasant 
news for the Ecuadoran people, Gallardo said, although he would

  Red Sun began operating about three years ago and carried 
out 
dynamite attacks on public installations and on the headquarters 
of political parties. None of those attacks produced casualties.

  [Text] Finally this evening, the National Assembly of 
Suriname has given the government permission to apply for 
political membership of Caricom [Caribbean Community], however, 
membership to the Common Market was also approved based on 
certain conditions. Their National Assembly now wants to know 
the effects of the Common Market on the Surinamese economy and 
the Suriname foreign affairs minister is to deliberate that 
issue with Caricom. Marion Riedewald reports: 
  [Begin Riedewald recording] At the moment only three percent 
of Suriname's imports are from the Caricom. Opposition member 
(Winston Jeshelin) criticized Minister Soebhas Mungra of foreign 
affairs, who said that Suriname doesn't have to fear being 
flooded by Caribbean products. (Jeshelin) said that Suriname's 
membership of the Common Market means the promotion of trade in 
both directions. He still fears some negative consequences of 
Suriname's membership of the Common Market. Based on the three 
percent trade between Suriname and the Caribbean, he estimates 
that the country yearly will earn $343 million less from import 
tax. 
  (Jeshelin) also wants to know how Suriname will pay the 
yearly contribution of $700,000 to Caricom. He says that 
production facilities in Suriname first must be improved before 
the country seeks markets for its export products. According to 
him, Caricom lacks those markets. (Jeshelin) fears that a 
budgetary deficit will increase as a result of effects of the 
Common Market. Minister Mungra said that expansion of markets 
will lower the cost of production. 
  The National Assembly authorized the government to apply for 
political membership of the Caricom and deliberate about the 
conditions to enter the Common Market. [end recording]

  [Text] After leaving a private meeting with members of the 
Chamber of Deputies Defense Committee, Defense Minister General 
Rafael Angel Montero Revette acknowledged that part of the 
economic and financial sector is promoting a destabilization 
plan that would affect all other sectors of Venezuelan society. 
  In his elusive responses to newsmen's questions, the 
minister 
said "a plan is being executed, as we all know, which includes 
economic, social, financial destabilization, and subversion. We 
are adopting intelligence measures, however, to investigate and 
to do everything that we can to emerge from the crisis." 
  The minister voiced his optimism about "the measures adopted 
by the government which caused the rumor strategy that they 
tried to implement to fail." 
<H5>  Centaur Plan </H5>
  For his part, Deputy Ibrahim Sanchez, president of the 
Chamber of Deputies Defense Committee, reiterated that they have 
not been able to pinpoint what area of the financial sector the 
Centaur Plan is part of. The Centaur Plan consists of sending 
threatening facsimile statements to certain persons and 
financial institutions to create uncertainty. 
  According to the legislator, the minister referred to 
threats 
of bankruptcy and false dollar quotations as part of a direct 
attack on the Venezuelan financial system. This plan, in view of 
its serious economic implications, will be investigated by 
intelligence officials. 
  Montero Revette cited as an example a package of counterfeit 
dollars detected before they were placed on the financial 
market. This averted a complex situation which could have had 
violent reactions on the part of buyers who would have been 
swindled. 
  The defense minister recognized also that authorities are 
investigating the influence that narcotrafficking might have on 
this situation "where it is not a case of persons of leftist or 
rightist persuasion, but of persons who are motivated by money." 
  Montero Revette ruled out the possibility that officials who 
were dismissed for their participation in the 1992 thwarted coup 
are involved in the destabilization plan. 
  Other deputies who attended the meeting said the defense 
minister had a document on the Centaur Plan, which did not have 
specific information, but which only mentioned a so-called 
"Ayacucho Group."

<F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Speaking on behalf of the executive branch, 
Guillermo Alvarez Bajares, minister of the Central Information 
Office [OCI], has denied Amnesty International's predictions 
that very serious incidents will take place in Venezuela because 
of the socioeconomic situation the country is now facing. 
Vicente Briceno has this report: 
  [Begin recording] [Briceno] The OCI minister downplayed 
Amnesty International's report that urges the government to be 
on the alert for social unrest that could emerge within the next 
few months. According to the government spokesman, there is no 
reason why such incidents, which would have a negative impact on 
democracy, should emerge in Venezuela. In turn, he said those 
who are forecasting chaos are harbingers of doom. 
  [Alvarez] These predictions make no sense. We certainly 
respect Amnesty International, an international nongovernmental 
organization, and we respect its right and obligation to monitor 
human rights. Amnesty International prepared a report on 
Venezuela and pointed out there were human rights violations in 
Venezuela during the past few years. We find it unusual that an 
Amnesty International spokesman has turned his attention to 
Venezuela, because currently there are a great many 
opportunities to exercise all democratic rights. He is telling 
us, I do not know based on what, that we must be on the alert 
because of the crises that might arise in Venezuela within the 
next few months. 
  [Briceno] In another turn of events, Minister Alvarez said 
he 
was pleased with the civic Lights Against Crime campaign, 
whereby Caracas drivers turn on the headlights of their cars to 
call attention to rising violence. The movement last staged a 
peaceful demonstration on 31 May. Alvarez also said he is not 
planning to request another Special Powers Law at the National 
Congress, and he recalled that the previous Special Powers Law 
was not requested by the Rafael Caldera administration. [end

<F P=106> [Report by Jesus Matheus Linares; quotation marks as </F>
published] 
  [Text] Caracas, May 30 -- This Monday May 30, at midday, an 
arrest warrant was executed for Air Force General Efrain 
Francisco Visconti Osorio and four other officers. The four 
officers fled with Visconti to Lima, Peru, following the failed 
coup attempt on 27 November, 1992. 
  Gen. Visconti Osorio arrived with his four subordinate 
officers at the Military Court at approximately 1330. The men 
were transferred from the Lino Clemente Battalion headquarters, 
where they are being held. 
  Visconti told reporters: I am not interested in commenting 
on 
any issues. 
  He was asked: Are you considering returning to the 
Venezuelan 
Air Force? 
  That is our greatest hope. 
  Are you sure President Caldera will grant a pardon? 
  We are sure of that. That is part of the peace policy the 
President and the government are promoting. 
  What are the conditions? 
  The basic condition is for us to face justice and the 
government will guarantee a pardon. 
  The general was also asked about a rumor that the officers 
exiled in Peru were given millions of bolivars to return to 
Venezuela. He responded by shaking his head with a smile of 
amazement. 
  Why did you flee the country on 27 November? 
  He said flatly: We have already answered that question 
before. 
  What is your opinion about the arrest warrant issued for 
former President Carlos Andres Perez? 
  You have studied that in detail and know more about it than 
I 
do, as I have just arrived, he answered. 
  You have said you have "great hope" for the country. 
  Our intention is to contribute to finding a definitive 
solution for all of the soldiers who remain under arrest, 
following the 4 February and 27 November uprisings. 
  Why were you the last to return? 
  Because I was the highest ranking officer to go to Peru and 
the process demanded I return last, he explained. 
  "Panorama" asked Visconti if he would accept a position in 
the Caldera administration, as Commander Arias Cardenas did, 
once he is pardoned and leaves the Venezuelan Armed Forces. He 
flatly said: "That we will have to study when the situation 
requires that type of evaluation." 
  Do you have any political aspirations? 
  There is nothing in that direction at this time, he said. 
  Captain Freddy Rio Pacheco, the presiding judge, reported 
that once the officers have been formally served with the arrest 
warrants, Carmen Salinas will temporarily act as their defense 
attorney. Rios explained that this would be "to assist them in 
preparing their deposition at the inquiry, read the trial 
records, and set the dates for the formal inquiry.

<F P=106> [Article by Vasconcelo Quadros] </F>
  [Text] Sao Paulo -- The investigation into the corruption 
scheme put together by Paulo Cesar Farias [PC], treasurer of 
former President Collor's electoral campaign, led the Federal 
Police [PF] to the largest clandestine network of operations 
installed in the financial system. They also found out that 
Brazil has become one of the largest Latin American fiscal 
havens. 
  Subdivisions of the PC scheme could be identified in nearly 
200 large companies. To get an idea of the mountain of money 
that circulates in the arteries of this suspicious system, it is 
enough to cite three foreign financial and exchange companies 
being investigated: America, Guarani, and Amambai. These three 
companies conducted operations in Brazil in 1991 and 1992 
totalling more than $7 billion. 
<H5>  Bank Secrecy </H5>
  The Cambio America S.A. company, which is headquartered in 
Panama, operated through its 0673-35-000069/3 account with the 
Foz de Iguacu branch of the Sao Paulo State Bank [Banespa] and 
moved more than $2 billion from February 1992 to December 1993. 
The only explanation the police have so far about the origin and 
destination of this money is contained in the bank balance 
sheets obtained after bank secrecy on the account was lifted. 
  The Guarani Cambio S.A. company, from Paraguay, used account 
number 0237-02-018-05 of the Ponta Pora (Mato Grosso do Sul 
State) branch of Bamerindus and has operated with as much as $4 
billion. The Amambai Cambio S.A. company, which police suspect 
is linked to Guarani Cambio S.A., has deposited more than $1 
billion in its account number 0237-17-731-10, also at the 
Bamerindus Ponta Pora branch. 
  The three companies were created outside the country to 
purchase and sell foreign currency, gold, silver, and any kind 
of exchange operation. In the Central Bank [BC], however, there 
is no request for operations in their name. The only data on 
them is the bank register. "There is strong evidence that they 
supplied funds to ghost accounts and `oranges' (people who lent 
their names for illicit transactions). These details were 
unveiled during investigations into the PC case," a PF source 
reported. The first inquest on the Alagoas State-born 
businessman was opened two years ago. Currently, this number has 
increased to 40. Police now want to identify what other 
operations these enterprises have conducted in Brazil. 
<H5>  Pursuit </H5>
  The three financial companies were identified during the 
banking investigation of Cross Financial Corporation and Accent 
Financial Corporation, which are headquartered in the Virgin 
Islands' fiscal haven. The Cross and Accent companies operated 
with an estimated $150 million. Also included among the PC 
scheme companies is Kenaco Finance from Panama. According to the 
BC investigation, this company operated through an account in 
the Sao Paulo branch of Lloyds Bank and sent $1 billion abroad 
in 14 months. 
  The account trustee was Uruguayan Salomao Sapov Kaplan, 
whose 
preventive arrest has been decreed in Brazil as a result of his 
involvement in the PC scheme. Kaplan has been missing and the PF 
believe he is a "professional orange" who operated in several 
countries. Two other trustees of CC-5 (Circular Letter No. 5, 
which was created by the BC to allow foreigners to receive and 
send dollars abroad) accounts, from the Cross and Accent 
companies -- Ezequiel Amaranto Camerini and Roberto Carlos Dias 
Sosa -- are also being sought in Brazil. A few days ago, they 
asked the courts to revoke their arrest warrants so they could 
return to the country, but Judge Pedro Paulo Castello Branco of 
the Brasilia 10th Federal Court denied the request. 
  According to the PF, evidence indicates that the flow of 
suspicious money between Brazil and foreign countries may total 
20 percent of the volume of foreign trade operations. Of this 
total, the PC scheme operations were a minority. Nearly 700 
companies registered in the Securities and Exchange Commission 
are using the legal instrument represented by the CC-5 in the 
country. So far, most of them have not created problems for the 
government. Although police have barely begun uncovering a 
portion of the network, there is strong evidence that the origin 
and destination of these dollars may clash with several articles 
of the Penal Code. 
<H5>  Genealogy </H5>
  The 270,000-page pile of the so-called mother inquest into 
the PC case has resulted in the opening of 81 more PF inquests 
-- 40 are related to the PC scheme and the rest to suspicious 
activities by other enterprises. As a result of the new 
investigation, 255 people have been indicted. They range from 
former President Fernando Collor to the so-called "oranges." The 
federal courts have suspended bank secrecy on more than 300 cash 
accounts, 70 of them fictitious and opened in the name of 50 
ghosts. Another policemen remarked: "We do not know where the 
investigation will lead us, but we are certain we have uncovered 
the activities of a network that has operated for years without 
being controlled." 
  The network's discovery also has allowed the PF to 
investigate CC-5 accounts in more detail. These accounts feed 
the parallel dollar market and practically the overall 
clandestine system, which is directly linked to the fiscal 
havens. In these havens, a delicate method is used to make 
identification as difficult as possible. One of the operations 
detected by police shows that a $1.2 million remittance by a 
company named RAS Holding left Luxembourg on 26 May 1993, passed 
by the Indo-Suez Bank in Switzerland, an account in the Virgin 
Islands, and two days later already had been made hidden and 
distributed among the accounts of two Brazilian companies, the 
names of which are being kept secret.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Ungovernable Fiefs"] </F>
  [Text] If anyone had any doubts that state enterprises have 
become ungovernable states within the Brazilian state, those 
doubts were dissipated by the appalling disclosure that the 
directors and administrative councils of 17 state enterprises 
linked to the Transport Ministry converted their salaries to the 
URV [Real Value Unit] when it peaked in April, thus violating 
the provisional measure that had set the conversion at an 
average value. 
  Vexed by the violation of the provisional measure by 
organizations within the government itself, President Itamar 
Franco ordered the immediate dismissal of the administrative and 
human resources directors and the members of the administrative 
councils of these state enterprises. 
  The directors directly involved with jobs and salaries, who 
have the responsibility of defining salaries in the enterprises 
considered rebels, have been dismissed until all the 
irregularities and the directors' responsibility have been 
investigated and in order to prevent a beheading of management 
within the enterprises. 
  At the same time, the government has ordered that a clean 
sweep be made in state enterprises and the public administration 
to see whether the conversion of salaries to the URV was made 
with the average of the months of December, January, February, 
and March as outlined in the provisional measure, or whether the 
conversion was made at the peak with the last salary in March 
and in real cruzeiros. 
  Moreover, this will not be the last clash between state 
enterprises and the presidency. A nationalist due to his 
political breeding and a historic defender of state enterprises 
in Brazil's development, Franco has been disenchanted several 
times with the conduct of those enterprises' employees: "The 
state enterprises belong to the Brazilian people, not just a 
half a dozen people," he blurted out at the beginning of last 
year, when he demanded clear- cut accounting by Petrobras 
[Brazilian Petroleum Corporation]. 
  Last year, when the Planning Ministry asked state 
enterprises 
to submit the roster containing the salaries paid to employees 
and the benefits they receive, only a small number of the 150 
enterprises, foundations, and autonomous companies controlled by 
the Treasury promptly complied with the request. More than two 
months passed until the list was complete, with the 
corresponding wear and tear for authorities. 
  Because it is the country's largest state enterprise, 
because 
it has a complex accounting system, and because in addition to 
it own activities it acts as the cashier for Alcohol Production 
Program, Petrobras has been in the center of the tug of war 
between the government and the state enterprises. And by 27 
May, the special commission named by the government to audit 
Petrobras' accounts had not been able to comply with the 
commitment of submitting a complete report on the enterprise's 
situation to Mines and Energy Minister Alexis Stepanenko. 
  More than the lack of official confidence in the Treasury's 
control, which generated an immediate corporate reaction by 
Petrobras' employees, the government always favored the 
enterprise because it always wanted to assess the weight of the 
taxes on the final price of fuels in order to help the 
consumer's pocket and eventually to free Petrobras from the 
weight of that unjust tax onus. The lack of submitting 
clear-cut accounts has boomeranged against the enterprises. 
Public enterprises should never be afraid of the public.

  [Text] Havana, 2 Jun (EFE) -- Three of the Cubans who broke 
into the Belgian Embassy in Havana last Saturday left the 
building last night, according to official sources. The sources 
did not give the identity of the people who left the embassy 
last night, nor the identity of the person who left Sunday night. 
  Observers believe the four who left the residence of the 
Belgian ambassador could be the last people who were 
unexplainably able to break through dozens of police on Saturday 
morning. In documents released to the media on Tuesday, the 
refugees expressed their suspicions that the four were State 
Security agents.

  [Text] San Salvador, 2 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- Today in El 
Salvador, Juan Aristides Taveras, foreign relations secretary of 
state, said his country has never violated the UN and OAS 
embargo on Haiti. At a news conference, Taveras added that his 
country knows Haiti "is not guilty of its poverty," but the 
Dominican Republic "has lent Haiti a hand" in only those areas 
permitted under the terms imposed by the international community. 
  Taveras emphasized the UN as well as the OAS are aware of 
the 
fact that the Dominican Republic "has never violated the 
embargo." He added, however, "they continue to hold a grudge 
against us, which is unfair." 
  Fernando Infante, Dominican ambassador to El Salvador, 
pointed out that his country disagrees with the embargo against 
Haiti because we "know it will fail to resolve Haiti's problems, 
but, as a UN member, the Dominican Republic has to obey and 
respect the UN decision." Infante stressed that his country 
opposes "any type of invasion" in Haiti, because invasions "have 
never proven beneficial anywhere." 
  According to reports coming from Santo Domingo, Joaquin 
Balaguer's administration changed its mind from failing to 
comply with the UN and OAS embargo to accepting a tight embargo 
against Hait, an embargo that includes even foodstuffs and 
medicine. 
  Foreign Secretary Taveras, who came to El Salvador to attend 
Salvadoran President Armando Calderon Sol's inauguration on 1 
June, said the international community has never recognized the 
efforts his country made to help Haiti before the embargo went 
into effect. 
  The official noted: "My country's government, in order to 
overcome this grudge against us, went to the extreme of asking 
the UN to send in advisers, supervisors, and technical experts 
who, in plainclothes, will help us ensure the embargo is not 
violated. Our Armed Forces are the ones who are currently 
supervising this task."

  [Text] Following a meeting with President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari, the citizens' commission to help in investigating Luis 
Donaldo Colosio's homicide has declined the chief of state's 
invitation. This statement was made after members of the 
commission submitted their written resignation to the president. 
They believe their work is unnecessary in view of the 
investigations being conducted by Special Assistant Prosecutor 
Miguel Montes. 
  The citizens' commission told President Salinas that all the 
members agree the commission must be independent. The only 
legal procedure that could give legitimacy to the citizens' 
commission is if Mrs. Diana Laura Riojas [Colosio's widow] 
appoints them as assistants of the public prosecutor's office 
and judicial authorities.

<F P=106> [Report by Henry Becker] </F>
  [Text] Tegucigalpa -- General Finlander Armijo Ucles, 
inspector general of the Armed Forces, has warned that announced 
personnel and budget cuts in the Armed Forces place state 
security at risk. After noting that the government and the Armed 
Forces are in charge of keeping public order and preserving 
state security, he said this duty is being reduced more and more 
with each budget cut and every time a combat unit is disbanded. 
  He said those who have suggested such cuts have not taken 
into account the great harm being done to the country. "But we 
obey all orders from the president without question," he added. 
He also said there are no disputes within the Armed Forces over 
the crisis that the institution is experiencing. "There are no 
blocs that either favor or oppose the restrictions." 
  All of the men have become highly professional because of 
the 
training of troops in several exercises conducted jointly with 
the U.S. Army support. No special training for troops or 
officers can be completed if U.S. economic aid is reduced, he 
said. 
  Gen. Armijo Ucles said the equipment used by the Public 
Security Force belongs to the Armed Forces. Therefore, these 
arms will have to be returned to the Army once the Attorney 
General's Office takes control of the police. He added, "The 
decision could be changed, however, providing the government and 
the Higher Council reach a better understanding." 
  He said he wished the new police force a good start. "We are 
awaiting the results. We hope the crime rate will not increase, 
because this would present problems for a new and inexperienced 
police force." 
  Gen. Armijo Ucles also expressed his concern for the members 
of the National Investigations Directorate [DNI], "most of whom 
will enter the ranks of the unemployed." He warned about the 
possibility of jobless DNI agents being hired by drug 
traffickers or becoming ruffians whose activities could disrupt 
the country's order and democratic system. 
  He said the Armed Forces General Command will soon meet with 
the executive to outline a plan to hire the dismissed police 
officers. Otherwise, the people will have to deal with criminal 
gangs in which Armed Forces-trained agents could become death 
squad members or drug traffickers.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 2 Jun (NA) -- Economy Minister Domingo 
Cavallo spoke before the Senate plenum today. He strongly 
defended the government bill on pharmaceutical patents, 
emphasizing that its implementation will not provoke a rise in 
medicine prices. 
  Cavallo said the government bill contemplates the 
possibility 
of importing medicines from other countries if prices go up 
"excessively." 
  Cavallo said the government's eagerness to approve a patents 
law "is not due to the possibility of economic sanctions by the 
United States, but to the need to encourage investment and 
permit our scientific and technological development." 
  Cavallo participated in the Senate public hearing, before 
representatives of all interested committees, to explain the 
government position with respect to the controversial patents 
law, an initiative that the U.S. Government tenaciously wants 
approved. 
  Cavallo spoke for over two and a half hours. During this 
time he answered innumerable questions from legislators and 
directors of the different entities interested in the issue of 
medicines manufacturing and trading. 
  The finance minister's visit to the Senate was within the 
framework of a round of hearings organized by the Industry 
Committee, presided over by Senator Jose Genoud of the Radical 
Civic Union. The patents bill, however, is also being analyzed 
by the Science and Technology Committee, the Health Committee, 
and the Commerce and Penal Affairs Committee. 
  During the long session Cavallo did not mention the 
possibility of submitting a new draft bill replacing the one 
currently under discussion in the Senate. The executive branch 
sent the bill to Congress in March 1993. Cavallo said that 
senators will introduce all the necessary changes into the 
original bill. 
  The economy minister said the protection of intellectual 
property rights in general, and particularly the protection of 
intellectual rights in the field of pharmaceuticals, is 
"essential for investment in research and development." 
  He made clear he was talking about "large investments, 
because efforts to discover new products and find solutions to 
health problems demand very large amounts of money and a lot of 
knowledge." 
  Cavallo said that in order to achieve those objectives "you 
need to risk capital, and those who risk it want to have certain 
guarantees that the product resulting from their investment in 
research and development will not lose value because it is easy 
to copy." 
  The minister said he was convinced that "Argentina will be 
able to receive risk capital only if intellectual properties are 
well protected." 
  "The reason why the executive branch presented this project 
on patents was because it wanted the country to offer the best 
possible conditions for strong investment in research and 
development," Cavallo said. 
  The minister said that a country capable of organizing teams 
of good scientists and technicians involved in research and 
development "can also create the conditions for national capital 
to take advantage of the good climate for the application of 
human knowledge to invest in research and development in the 
country." 
  Cavallo emphasized that the protection of intellectual 
property rights through a patents regime "is part of a policy 
that aims at encouraging investments in Argentina, and above all 
forms of investment that are very important for the future 
growth of the nation." 
  The minister explained that this was why the Carlos Menem 
administration supported the establishment of a minimum level of 
protection for intellectual property rights in the GATT talks. 
  The economy minister said that the idea of approving a 
patents law in exchange for the elimination of agricultural 
subsidies by developed countries "is a very weak argument, 
because anyone with a good understanding of the way the world 
economy and national economies function knows that a country 
that does not provide protection for intellectual rights will 
pay for it in the long run, because it will be forced to remain 
on the sidelines of the flow of investments." 
  "It is not very convincing to threaten to do something that 
will end up hurting your country," Cavallo said, in justifying 
the scarce benefits developing countries obtained through the 
GATT talks. 
  During the long negotiations, which lasted almost eight 
years, the poorest countries argued with little success that 
they could protect intellectual property rights only if they 
obtained concessions in the agricultural field. 
  Cavallo said he was convinced developing countries will be 
able to remove the industrialized countries' distorting policies 
"when each one of our countries has obtained the degree of 
economic power capable of transforming us into relevant 
negotiators on a world scale." 
  The minister said: "In order to achieve this objective we 
must create the best conditions for investment, but particularly 
for investments that yield the greatest return, such as 
investments in research and development, well directed and 
intelligently administered." 
  Cavallo reiterated that the eagerness of the executive 
branch 
to give protection to intellectual rights "is part of a policy 
that wants to encourage investment and growth in Argentina." 
  Referring to the possibility that the bill protecting 
intellectual rights could hurt the population by provoking a 
rise in medicine prices, Cavallo said: "The argument is 
deceitful and has a minimum degree of truth." 
  "When you speak about satisfying the needs of the people, 
you 
cannot only think of the act of production in a factory, once 
you have finished your research and you have something new. 
Because it is more important to have the capacity and the means 
to discover something than the ability to take a product to the 
market." 
  "The more we encourage investment, the more we will have the 
competitive ability to develop new products, new medicines, and 
new solutions to health problems," Cavallo said. 
  The minister said that the supply of a determined drug or 
medicine "in the medium and long term, which is what matters, 
depends essentially on the amount of investment by the different 
laboratories in finding solutions to unsolved problems." 
  "Nothing can guarantee you that those who copy a medicine 
and 
introduce it into the market will be able to sell it cheaper," 
Cavallo said. 
  He said there are cases of copied medicines that are more 
expensive than the original products. Cavallo, however, did not 
give details about brands or laboratories. 
  "It is very important for medicines to have reasonable 
prices. There is no reason why we should not encourage 
competition through prices, always giving, of course, the best 
possible information about the product," Cavallo said. 
  "I do not believe national or foreign laboratories when they 
say that they can supply the market at lower prices. I think 
Argentina's and the world's experience is that the 
pharmaceutical industry tends to charge the highest possible 
prices," the minister said. 
  He said the solution to the problem of high prices "must be 
faced, on one hand, by encouraging investment, so that each 
laboratory makes the maximum research effort and generates more 
competition; and second, by the implementation of general rules 
used by countries to make sure that prices are not excessive." 
  Cavallo defended the application of the law of competition 
in 
the case of medicines, recalling that the official project on 
pharmaceutical patents includes a clause permitting the 
importation of products if there are excessive price increases. 
  This clause permits the importation of medicines, but from 
countries with patent laws that recognize intellectual property 
rights. 
  Cavallo said the executive branch bill recognizes research 
efforts, and protects the population by guaranteeing reasonable 
prices. 
  "It is not true that the patents law will provoke price 
increases," the minister said.

  [Text] President Carlos Menem yesterday said that the 
social situation in Tierra del Fuego had been caused by 
"activists who go around the country creating problems for those 
who want to work." Menem did not identify the official report on 
which he based his statement. He added that "there were hooded 
people with blunt objects in their hands" at a factory that had 
been occupied by strikers. Despite the fact that he was aware 
of the description that Menem gave of the labor conflict, Tierra 
del Fuego Governor Jose Estabillo said at a meeting with 
Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf that the social situation was 
under control, and without any possibility for an outburst. 
  After meeting with Estabillo, Ruckauf went to a meeting also 
attended by Presidential Secretary Eduardo Bauza, Economy 
Minister Domingo Cavallo, and Labor Minister Armando Caro 
Figueroa. Caro Figueroa reported on the negotiations, 
expressing optimism for a rapid solution to the conflict. 
Cavallo, Ruckauf, and Bauza also decided that Caro Figueroa 
would coordinate all negotiations, although at yesterday's 
meeting it was made clear that the labor minister will have to 
report on each step of the negotiations. 
  Hours before the meeting held at Bauza's office, Menem made 
statements to the radio station of his friend Gerardo Sofovich. 
The president made assurances that a handful of activists are 
going around the country showing up at every social conflict, 
and that UOM [Metalworkers Union] leader Lorenzo Miguel intends 
to facilitate a settlement to the labor crisis. 
  "It is obvious that it is not only workers who are operating 
now, but groups of agitators who go around the country, creating 
problems for those who want to work. I listened to a report by 
a judge, who in order to enter a factory had to adopt a series 
of measures, and he finally met with hooded strikers, who were 
hooded not because of cold weather but because they wanted to 
conceal their faces. Some of them had blunt objects," Menem 
told Sofovich. 
  [Sofovich] "Did you have a chance to meet with Governor 
Estabillo?" 
  [Menem] "Yes, he told me that the situation in Tierra del 
Fuego is totally under control. Yet it seems that strikers 
continue in their position without obeying the decision by the 
Labor Ministry."

Indigenous Communities to be held in Cochabamba. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] The OAS ordinary 
session will be held in Brazil this month. The foreign minister 
has stated that, as usual, Bolivia will uphold a firm stance 
regarding its landlocked situation, a more than century-old 
problem with Chile, which that country has systematically 
refused to discuss within the OAS framework. 
  [Aranibar] The current government, in practice and in 
theory, 
is tackling the maritime issue from the viewpoint disclosed both 
by the president of the Republic and myself, and which has to do 
with Bolivian willingness to strengthen relations with Chile as 
long as there is a desire to discuss all the existing problems, 
even the maritime problem. We are going to act at a bilateral, 
trilateral, and multilateral level with that objective in mind. 
This is one of the purposes of our presence at the upcoming OAS 
assembly in Belem, Para State. 
  Changing the subject, I would like to tell you that 
yesterday, together with the vice president of the Republic, I 
had the pleasure of closing the preliminary meeting of Latin 
American and Caribbean people, or better said their governments, 
to discuss the UN's decade for indigenous communities. This was 
a very important and far-reaching meeting, and it approved a 
package of recommendations resulting from the consensus between 
the governments represented on the occasion and the indigenous 
people and communities that participated. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Marcio Aith] </F>
  [Text] The PFL [Liberal Front Party] has not helped the 
PSDB [Brazilan Social Democracy Party]-- at least not in the 
states where the coalition between the two parties was made 
formal in the electoral colleges in which presidential candidate 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso and the PSDB were already strong. 
  According to polls, gubernatorial candidates Mario Covas and 
Marcelo Alencar are the favorites in Sao Paulo and Rio de 
Janeiro, respectively. Both, who belong to the PSDB, have 
received weak PFL support. 
  Although the PSDB coalition with the PFL has increased the 
former's electoral chances in Pernambuco, Miguel Arraes -- the 
PSB [Brazilian Socialist Party] gubernatorial candidate -- is 
the main favorite. Arraes supports Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's 
presidential candidacy. In Parana, the PFL-PSDB coalition's 
strongest candidate is Jaime Lerner, of the PDT [Democratic 
Labor Party]. 
  In Bahia, Santa Catarina, Ceara, Minas Gerais, and Para, the 
coalition was not made concrete because of lack of interest on 
the part of the two parties' regional leaders. In these states 
the PFL is strong, and will be an important PSDB rival. 
  Presidential candidate Cardoso told reporter Ana Carolina 
Silveira in Campinas (Sao Paulo) yesterday: "The parties are 
establishing coalition in different ways. We thought that 
Brazil was uniform, but it is not. There can be no vertical 
coalition, and the parties are adopting different coalitions in 
the different states." 
  The latest coalitions -- the PT has decided to support 
gubernatorial candidate Jutahy Magalhaes in Bahia, and the PMDB 
[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] gave up the idea of 
presenting a candidate in Parana -- were decided upon over the 
last weekend and on 30 May. They are as follow:

  [Text] A secret Senate session was held on 1 June. Foreign 
Minister Carlos Figueroa and Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat 
explained to the Senate the Chilean stance toward the free trade 
agreement with the United States. The two ministers went to 
Congress to participate in a secret Senate session, called 
specifically for this purpose. 
  Foreign Minister Figueroa confirmed that his policy in 
general is to uphold our country's independence and seek 
benefits for Chile. 
  Minister Aninat supplied a detailed and complete report on 
the possibility of signing this agreement. 
  [Begin recording] [Figueroa] We have participated in a very 
significant Senate session in which all the remarks made by the 
senators were aimed at making our foreign policy and the 
international economic negotiations a state policy. 
  [Aninat] This was a very useful session because we gathered 
remarks, comments, safeguards, and risks. Concerning this issue, 
some senators believe in the possibility of incurring risks. 
  We have taken note and taken into account all the safeguard 
elements the Senate has supplied us so that they will be taken 
into account in future negotiations. [end recording] 
  During this session between the ministers and the senators, 
it was confirmed that it is necessary for the Senate to keep 
permanently posted on all NAFTA negotiations, bearing in mind 
the U.S. Senate's significant role in all issues linked to 
international trade agreements.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities monitored through 2 June. 
  Unemployment in Montevideo Department stood at 8.7 percent 
in 
the period extending from February to April 1994, thus 
registering a slight increase compared with the first quarter of 
the year, in which the unemployment rate was 8.1 percent. 
(Montevideo EL PAIS in Spanish 27 May 94 Market Indicators 
Section p 1) 
  The Central Bank reported on 26 May that the central 
government registered a $22.6 million surplus in the first two 
months of the year, thus reversing last month's negative result. 
(Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO in Spanish 27 May 94 p 11) 
  According to figures disclosed by the Central Bank on 26 
May, 
the trade deficit continued to grow in March, totaling $741.2 
million over the last 12 months, which represents 5.6 percent of 
GDP. In the first quarter of the year, the trade deficit was 55 
percent higher than the corresponding period last year, 
amounting to $175 million. (Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO 
in Spanish 27 May 94 p 10) 
  According to information disclosed by the National 
Statistics 
Institute on 27 May, salaries declined in real terms in April, 
both in the private and public sectors, by 0.9 and 2.8 percent 
respectively. Despite this decline, salaries in the Civil 
Service increased by 1.2 percent in real terms in the first four 
months of the year. Salaries in the private sector, however, 
declined by 0.3 percent in the said period both in Montevideo 
and in the interior. (Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO in 
Spanish 30 May 94 p 9) 
  Wholesale prices went up 2.6 percent in May, thus totaling 
11 
percent so far this year and 30.9 percent over the last 12 
months. This information was released by the Central Bank on 30 
May. The items that registered the highest increase were oil 
by-products (7.2 percent), nonmetal minerals (4.8 percent), and 
clothing (4.5 percent). (Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO in 
Spanish 31 May 94 p 8) 
  Uruguay's trade with its partners from the Common Market of 
the South, Mercosur, grew by 19 percent in the first quarter of 
the year compared with the corresponding period last year, thus 
representing 47 percent of Uruguay's overall trade. Uruguay's 
leading trading partner is Brazil, whose exports to our country 
amounted to $157.7 million in the first quarter, thus 
registering a 29 percent growth compared with 1993. Uruguay's 
trade deficit with its Mercosur partners added up to $122.4 
million in the said period. (Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO 
in Spanish 31 May 94 p 8)

<F P=106> [Article by Cristina Alves Emarion Monteiro: "No Buyers for </F>
Caraiba and Cobra"] 
  [Text] The official auctioneer for the Rio de Janeiro Stock 
Exchange, Danilo Ferreira, did not have much to do yesterday 
when he started the bidding to sell the Caraiba Mining Company, 
a copper producer, and Cobra Computers, a firm controlled by the 
Bank of Brazil. As had been expected even by the representatives 
of the government's privatization commission, the two auctions 
failed for lack of interest. 
  Commission President Andre Montoro Filho has announced that 
the process of privatizing those two firms will be reevaluated 
next Monday. He will wait for the conclusion of negotiations 
between employees of the mining company and the Arbi Group's 
Caraiba Metals firm, the largest buyer of copper from the mining 
company. "Depending on the results of those talks, we may 
schedule another auction within 30 or 40 days," he says. 
  The Caraiba Mining Company, whose head office is in Bahia, 
was being offered at a minimum price of $5.2 million, with the 
purchaser also being required to pay a fine of $3 million if he 
decided to shut down the company mine in less than five years. 
  Cobra -- The commission will also examine a few alternatives 
with the Bank of Brazil for privatizing Cobra Computers, which 
has now been put up for auction at the Rio de Janeiro Stock 
Exchange for the second time without attracting a buyer. The 
minimum price was set at $12 million. The firm owes the Bank of 
Brazil $10 million in addition to its $11.2 million in labor 
debts. Montoro Filho has said that the government-owned firm 
will be liquidated only as a last resort and that before that 
happens, the possibility of incorporating it into the Bank of 
Brazil itself will be examined. 
  Braz Magno da Silva, who represents the employees, has 
announced that he has obtained approval from the institution 
itself to negotiate the purchase of the firm.

* The 14 privatizations occurring during the Itamar administration were 
already scheduled by the Collor administration. 


<H5>  Debts Prevent Sale </H5>
  The past 40 days alone have seen the postponement of 
auctions 
for the privatization of three government-owned firms: Brazilian 
Lloyd--for which there were no buyers on 30 March--Cobra 
Computers, which has been put on sale twice without success, and 
Caraiba Mining, which also attracted no bids at yesterday's 
auction. 
  One of the difficulties in selling those firms is their high 
level of indebtedness. To take control of Lloyd, for example, a 
buyer will have to cope with a debt exceeding $100 million. 
Another auction to try to sell Lloyd is scheduled for 11 May. 
  The firms in question are viewed by the financial market as 
the program's real wallflowers. According to some analysts, what 
future buyers really want is the ability to earn a return on 
their investment -- that is, firms that will show a profit in 
the future. What happens in the case of firms with little to 
commend them is that the government often prefers to give them 
one last chance before liquidating them, since liquidation 
entails social problems. 
  But the thing that is behind these successive failures is 
the 
sluggishness of the privatization process. Consultants and 
executives in the financial market complain that since taking 
office in October 1992, President Itamar Franco has not added 
any names to the list of government-owned firms to be sold. All 
the privatizations taking place in recent months have involved 
government-owned firms whose sale was already scheduled by the 
Collor administration. 
  Delay -- The director of the Trevisan and Associates 
consulting firm, Joao Antonio Lopes, recalls that since the PQU 
(Union Petrochemicals) was sold in January of this year, there 
have been no more auctions of important firms. The market also 
suspects that the sale of Embraer [Brazilian Aeronautics 
Company] on the 20th of this month may be postponed. 
  "There is a very big delay in establishing the direction the 
program will take. Moreover, there is no interest in buying 
firms that are in debt or technologically backward," says Joao 
Antonio. 
  Luiz Chrysostomo de Oliveira, former superintendent of 
privatization at the BNDES [National Economic and Social 
Development Bank], feels, however, that the failure of the last 
two auctions has not jeopardized the privatization program. What 
may stall the process is the administration's lack of a clear 
political will to sell government-owned firms. 
  Chrysostomo also observed that another factor is Congress' 
retreat from voting on economic topics in connection with 
constitutional revision. 
  "Failure to approve the law on the concession of public 
utilities, the greater flexibility of the telecommunications and 
petroleum monopolies, and the electric power industry may harm 
the privatizations," Chrysostomo said. 
  Ricardo Fernandez, director of the BFC [expansion not given] 
Bank, says the market is worried about the continuity of the 
privatization process. 
  "The government recently managed to sell Arafertil. The 
reason it was unable to auction off the two firms yesterday was 
that they really do not interest anyone. Cobra, for example, 
lags far behind in technology, and Lloyd has a lot of debts. The 
firms constituting the `filet mignon' of the privatization 
process are yet to come," says Fernandez. 
<H5>  Program Losing Speed </H5>
  The privatization program, which began under the Sarney 
administration and picked up speed during the Collor era, was 
established to reduce the state's presence in the economy and 
provide an opportunity for more investment in the fields of 
health, education, and infrastructure. Many of the firms had 
been privately owned at one time but were later absorbed by the 
government through the BNDES to prevent their liquidation. The 
bank was a sort of first-aid clinic for the firms. That was the 
case with Caraiba Metals and Mafersa, for example. 
  During the Sarney era, the man in charge of many of those 
privatizations was engineer Marcio Fortes. In the Collor era, it 
was the turn of economist Eduardo Modiano, another former 
president of the BNDES. The privatization of such firms as 
Usiminas (1991) and the CSN (1993) was marked by court 
injunctions and protests in the streets by workers. Those 
protests were seen abroad in pictures of street riots carried by 
the world's principal TV networks. 
  Then came a decline. Since President Itamar took office, 
only 
14 government-owned firms have been sold: three were fertilizer 
manufacturers, three were steel companies, and the others were 
in the petrochemical industry. But all of them were already 
included in the PND (National Privatization Program) inherited 
from the Collor era. Itamar has not added any new firms to the 
list. 
  The criticism most frequently heard from businessmen, 
consultants, and bankers is that the process is moving ahead 
much more slowly under the Itamar administration. There are 
those on the economic team itself who claim that the resistance 
is coming much more from Planalto Palace than from the left-wing 
parties. One of the "stars" on that team recently went so far as 
to say that the "Juiz de Fora gang" was not committed to moving 
ahead with the program. The problem is that to improve the 
government's cash situation, it is reportedly essential to have 
the money from the sale of government-owned firms, which can 
contribute to investments and, chiefly, help pay off the 
national debt.

<F P=106> [Article by Fortaleza correspondent Flaminio Araripe] </F>
  [Text] Planning Minister Beni Veras has announced that 
Regional Integration Minister Aluizio Alves has authorized the 
revamping of the National Department of Drought Control (DNOCS), 
reducing the number of directorates from 17 to four. Veras said 
this process would be implemented this month. In addition to 
the elimination of 13 directorates, the name of DNOCS might be 
changed to National Department of Semi-Arid Zones [Departamento 
Nacional do Semi-Arido]. DNOCS allegedly drilled wells, in an 
irregular procedure, on a ranch owned by Chamber of Deputies 
President Inocencio Oliveira (PFL-PE) [Liberal Front 
Party-Pernambuco State]. 
  Four regional directorates -- Pernambuco, Ceara, Piaui, and 
Bahia -- will be eliminated. The central administration's 
directorates in Fortaleza, namely Water Resources, Fish Farms, 
Irrigation, and Administration-Finance, would be spared. DNOCS 
Director General Hildeberto Araujo has confirmed the revamping. 
  DNOCS, established in 1909, now has 3,183 employees and a 
$240 million budget subject to approval by Congress. According 
to Araujo, President Itamar Franco will, within the next few 
days, form a commission to study a transfer of jurisdiction of 
the Sao Francisco River, which was proposed by the Regional 
Integration Ministry. 
  Beni Veras proposed forming a commission to study the use 
and 
protection of the Sao Francisco River, a commission to be formed 
by 10 northeastern states. The jurisdiction transfer of the 
river would involve the states of Pernambuco, Ceara, Rio Grande 
do Norte, and Paraiba. The proposal includes the establishment 
of a national park to protect the river's headwaters vegetation 
on both banks. 
  According to the planning minister, Bahia State, which has 
been benefiting from the river by using aqueducts, is being 
"selfish" in opposing the project to transfer jurisdiction of 
the Sao Francisco River to the northeastern states, where there 
are no permanently flowing rivers.

<F P=106> [From the "Seven O'Clock Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] Today, ELN [Army of National Liberation] guerrillas 
blew up a stretch of the Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline near the 
municipality of Pelaya in southern Cesar Department. 
  More than 8,000 barrels of crude oil spilled into Gamboa 
ravine that flows into the Zapatosa marsh. This rich 
agricultural and cattle region is now facing an environmental 
emergency as a result of actions carried out by organized 
criminal groups. Over the past two weeks, several guerrilla 
attacks have taken place in this same area and have polluted 
rivers and streams throughout the region. 
  This afternoon, ECOPETROL [Colombian Petroleum Enterprise] 
technicians began implementing emergency measures to prevent the 
oil spill from spreading, reaching the marsh, and causing 
irreparable environmental damage. 
  In another attack, ELN guerrillas arrived at Villa del 
Rosario, Norte de Santander, some time after 0200 and proceeded 
to detonate explosive devices at the police department and the 
mayor's office. Several buildings near the police station, 
including the local comptroller's office, were also damaged by 
the blasts. 
  Following the attack, the ELN column proceeded to ambush a 
police patrol in Villa del Rosario, Cucuta. Three police 
officers were killed and four others seriously injured in the 
attack.

  [Text] On 1 June, Israeli Ambassador Shmu'el Merom stated 
he personally was doing everything he could to stop the closure 
of his country's embassy in Asuncion, and he mentioned that this 
possibility had no links with an alleged "irritation" with the 
Paraguayan Government. "On the contrary, our bilateral relations 
are getting better and better every day through cooperation 
agreements," he said. 
  He also pointed out the fact that Paraguay has decided to 
open an embassy in Israel is a demonstration of the excellent 
bilateral relations. "With this, President Juan Carlos Wasmosy 
has kept his word," Merom stressed. 
  The diplomat also indicated that the probable closure of his 
country's embassy is being evaluated by an Embassy Section 
Commission and that within two weeks a final decision will be 
made, and he emphatically rejected the fact that the decision 
could be linked to alleged Israeli "irritation" over military 
matters, as it had been given to understand. 
  Merom also indicated that there is not a large Jewish colony 
in Paraguay, some 900 people. He also mentioned that his 
country's important decisions were made in Jerusalem, the 
capital, and not Tel Aviv. 
  He reiterated that if the embassy's closure is approved, the 
appropriate steps will be followed and the announcement will be 
made in the formal manner. He pointed out that cultural and 
other types of cooperation agreements will follow their normal 
courses through a concurrent ambassador or a permanent one in 
Asuncion. "The current excellent relations between Paraguay and 
Israel will continue to progress for the satisfaction of both 
parties," the ambassador said. 
  Merom also clarified that an eventual decision by his 
government has nothing to do with the United States, and he also 
denied that his government is an "unconditional ally" of the 
United States.

  [Text] Belem do Para (Brazil), 5 Jun (EFE) -- The foreign 
ministers of the member countries of the Organization of 
American States (OAS) reiterated in their General Assembly the 
need to seek a peaceful solution to the Haitian crisis, in 
contrast to the thesis that supports armed intervention. 
  In brief statements made before the traditional "informal 
meeting of foreign ministers" and prior to tomorrow's opening of 
the OAS General Assembly, most ministers came out in favor of 
maintaining the policy of sanctions against the Haitian coupist 
military. 
  Bolivian Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar Quiroga, who will 
chair the "ad hoc" OAS foreign ministers meeting to be held on 
Monday to study the Haitian crisis, affirmed that they have 
drafted a resolution of consensus that is almost finished. It 
is almost certain that a statement will be issued here 
"reaffirming the search for a peaceful solution based on all the 
UN and OAS resolutions that have been adopted throughout this 
period," Aranibar stated. 
  The Bolivian foreign minister said that, at the 24th OAS 
General Assembly being held in this Brazilian coastal city, the 
countries of the continent will also condemn "all illegal acts 
that are being committed and the continual and systematic 
violation of human rights in Haiti." 
  Among the OAS countries, "there is a deep conviction that a 
return to democracy and the return of President (Jean-Bertrand) 
Aristide are essential elements for the peaceful solution that 
the continent wants," Aranibar said. He added that his country 
"is opposed to any armed action." "Any decision along those 
lines could cause a cure worse that the illness," the president 
of the "ad-hoc" meeting said, adding that "some new ideas" are 
being studied to reinforce sanctions, "but nothing spectacular." 
  Strobe Talbott, U.S. under secretary of state, whose country 
has not ruled out armed intervention in Haiti to resolve the 
crisis following the coup against Aristide in 1991, did not 
refer to this point, but indicated that he expects that this 
meeting will reiterate the message of the international 
community that "the de facto government must end very soon." 
  "We have already done plenty for this to happen through 
cooperation, and we hope that new steps are adopted in the next 
few days and weeks," added Talbott, even though he did not 
specify the types of additional measures he was referring to. 
  The U.S. representative to the OAS meeting was optimistic 
regarding a solution to the Haitian crisis because of the 
"extraordinary solidarity" Assembly participants have displayed 
regarding this problem. 
  Costa Rican Foreign Affairs Minister Fernando Naranjo, on 
the 
other hand, said "there are still certain diplomatic, economic, 
and financial actions that can be implemented before thinking of 
more extreme measures." He added, "I believe that it is still 
not time for the use of force; instead, certain additional 
sanctions are still required. 
  The only person to openly admit the possibility of military 
intervention in Haiti was Argentine Foreign Relations Minister 
Guido di Tella who said his country would back an action of this 
sort if it were agreed to and authorized by the UN Security 
Council. Nevertheless, Di Tella affirmed that for the time 
being, what has to be done is to guarantee the closure of the 
border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic in order to 
comply with the total embargo imposed by the Security Council, 
which went into effect on 21 May.

  [Text] Belem, 4 Jun (DPA) -- The situation in Haiti and 
electoral fraud charges in the Dominican Republic will focus the 
attention of foreign ministers and top Latin American and U.S. 
representatives at the 24th OAS General Assembly that will start 
Monday in the Brazilian city of Belem. 
  Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim confirmed the 
importance that the organization places on the Haitian crisis, 
but he was skeptical about the possibility of increasing 
pressure on the military regime led by General Raoul Cedras 
through a total embargo against the Antillean country. 
  Diplomatic sources said they expect the Haitian issue to be 
discussed next Tuesday, but it could also be discussed on 
Sunday, at a meeting prior to the official assembly opening. 
  The most controversial issue is the use of force to 
reinstate 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who announced that he will 
attend the Belem meeting, Amorin told the press. 
  The five-day meeting will mark the end of the mandate of 
Brazilian Joao Baena Soares as head of the OAS for the past 
decade. The meeting will give way to his elected successor, 
Colombian President Cesar Gaviria. Gaviria, 47, should assume 
the post by late August or September, after the runoff 
presidential elections in Colombia. 
  The foreign ministers will also discuss the situation in the 
Dominican Republic resulting from fraud charges, following the 
recent presidential elections. Several countries of the region 
announced they will not recognize the results of the elections 
that gave a slight victory to incumbent President Joaquin 
Balaguer over Social Democrat Francisco Pena Herrera. 
  Among other issues, the Belem meeting will deal with an 
inter-American convention on women's rights, and the state of 
the struggle against drug trafficking and gun running.

  [Text] Havana, Jun 4 (AFP) -- The 124 Cubans who have 
occupied the residence of the Belgian ambassador in Havana for 
the past week to obtain political asylum in a foreign country 
are "waiting against all reason," Willy Verriest, emissary sent 
by the Belgian Government, stated on Saturday. 
  "It is a situation without a short term solution because 
Cuban authorities are not going to authorize the asylum seekers 
to leave the country. The Cuban authorities say they will not 
allow the seizing of an embassy to be a way to pressure to leave 
the country; they will not accept this," Verriest told the 
foreign media. 
  "To obtain authorization to travel to any country -- 
regardless of the country -- it is necessary that normal 
procedures be followed," added Verriest. Verriest was the 
Belgian Ambassador to Cuba from 1986 to early 1990. 
  "The positions of both governments are clear: Cuban 
authorities have given guarantees (that the occupants will not 
be subjected to retaliation when they leave the residence) and 
we have acknowledged those guarantees," he emphasized. 
  Asked if any progress had been made in the negotiations with 
the occupiers of the Belgian Ambassador's residence, Verriest 
declared: "There has been no progress. The advances are not 
sufficient." He added: "We asked the people to leave but I see 
that they remain in the residence." 
  He said he had the impression that the 124 occupants (68 
men, 
32 women, and 24 children) are, up to now, "a group that is very 
homogeneous," with a politicized discourse. 
  On Tuesday, in several messages sent to the foreign media, 
the occupants presented themselves as people who "peacefully 
oppose" the regime and said they would refuse any contact with 
Cuban authorities. They stated in their documents that they 
would rather "immolate themselves" before abandoning their 
objective of leaving Cuba and receiving asylum "in any other 
country." 
  According to several diplomatic sources in Havana, the 
current objective of Cuban authorities is to break the group's 
unity. As evidence, the sources say that on two occasions, at 
least, several people have entered the residence and that the 
124 occupants suspect those people to be state security members. 
  The Cuban media has mentioned the spotty entrance of 
additional asylum seekers and has said those people also want to 
be exiled. Four persons entered the diplomatic headquarters on 
Sunday, however, in an unexplained manner because there is a 
heavy police presence around the residence. One of them left on 
Monday and the other three on Wednesday night. In their place, 
two other individuals entered the residence, in an equally 
mysterious manner, on Thursday night, according to official 
Cuban and Belgian sources.

  [Text] Havana, 3 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Attempts to trespass the 
residences of the Mexican and French ambassadors and other 
reports of similar actions followed the occupation of the 
Belgian ambassador's home, which is on its seventh day today. 
  Three Cubans unsuccessfully tried to break into Mexican 
Ambassador Carlos Tello Macias' residence located in the 
exclusive neighborhood of Miramar on Monday afternoon, according 
unofficial reports. 
  A similar incident took place on Tuesday when four other 
Cubans tried to break into French Ambassador Jean Raphael 
Dufour's residence, also located in Miramar, which is west of 
Havana. In that incident, security guards arrested two men and 
two others fled. 
  Reports that were later denied of similar incidents in at 
least four other missions circulated in newspapers this week 
while the residence of the Belgian ambassador, Paul Vermiersch, 
continues to be occupied by over 100 Cubans who are trying to 
leave the country. 
  The building is surrounded by police while the authorities 
of 
both governments are holding talks to achieve a peaceful 
evacuation of the house in exchange for a Cuban offer to refrain 
from carrying out any reprisals against the asylum seekers.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina arrived in Qatar 
early today. Robaina and his delegation had previously 
participated in the ministerial summit of the Nonaligned 
Movement. 
  Robaina was greeted by Qatari Minister [passage indistinct] 
and Cuban Ambassador Orlando Requena. Robaina told local 
reporters that the Cuban Government is interested in developing 
ties with Qatar and other Gulf states and that to this end, 
diplomatic ties were recently established with Oman and that 
there is the political will to do likewise with the rest of the 
countries in the region. Robaina added that another goal of the 
trip is to study ways to develop bilateral trade in connection 
with the results of the trip to Cuba by Qatari businessmen. 
  In 48 hours, Robaina will fulfill a busy agenda including 
meetings with Qatar's head of state, Amir Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al 
Thani, and the ministers of foreign affairs, health, and economy 
and finance. Robaina will also tour the Umm Sa'id industrial 
complex and the petrochemical and steel plants. This occasion 
will also serve to officially inaugurate the Cuban Embassy. 
  Three months ago, Qatari Foreign Minister Hamad Bin-Jasim 
Bin-Jabur Al Thani visited Cuba and since then, Qatari 
delegations have gone Cuba to inquire about cooperation in 
sports, health, and tourism.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, </F>
in Cairo, by Jose Mejia, in Havana; from the "Exclusive" program 
-- live] 
  [Text] [Mejia] Please tell us about the Nonaligned Movement 
[NAM] summit and the resolution condemning the blockade against 
Cuba. How do you feel about Colombia hosting the forthcoming 
summit? 
  [Robaina] I am glad to have this exclusive opportunity, 
through the "Exclusive" program, to tell our people about this 
summit, which ended just a few hours ago. It has been a great 
opportunity to hold meetings. Practically every Cuban economic 
and political proposal was included in the final resolution, 
following many hours of extensive analysis. The 120 NAM members 
meeting in Cairo clearly shows everyone's will and commitment to 
strengthen its role and to ensure it plays the role it deserves. 
The meeting was significant for Cuba, in particular, not only 
because of what was discussed in every sphere but also because 
Cuba's just position on the blockade was praised in bilateral 
meetings. We have received the Movement's unanimous support not 
only reaffirming what was approved in Jakarta three years ago 
but also bolstering what the United Nations also recently 
approved and demanding, on behalf of the NAM and the poor of the 
Earth, the immediate cessation of such a hostile policy against 
Cuba. 
  [Mejia] Colombia will host the next summit. How was this 
decided? 
  [Robaina] The Movement has a regional rotation mechanism. 
Latin America had the right to host the next NAM summit, which 
should take place in September 1995. Colombia is one of the 
countries which the Latin American group believes are in a 
position to assume such a responsibility. Colombia presented 
its candidacy. The responsibility originally fell on Nicaragua, 
but Nicaragua announced that it was in no position to assume 
this responsibility. We all have confidence in the Colombian 
Government's organizational capacity. America, in general, and 
Colombia, in particular, are preparing to host the event at a 
very special time. Indonesia started strengthening the 
Movement, and Latin America and Colombia now have the duty to 
continue to do so. 
  [Mejia] Please tell us about the fourth Ibero-American 
summit, in Cartagena de Indias. What will Cuba propose at this 
summit? 
  [Robaina] The Ibero-American summit offers the nations of 
the 
continent and the region the chance to meet without being 
summoned by the empire. This has been expressed even more since 
the first meeting -- in Guadalajara -- since Madrid, and since 
Bahia. 
  The Ibero-American forum and its very special 
characteristics 
give this summit a special importance. The organizers and the 
Bahia summit called for this meeting to focus primarily on 
economic integration and to replace protocol speeches with 
debates among the regional heads of state. 
  Cuba is involved in all summit preparations. Our personnel 
have been working on this in Cartagena, Bogota, and several 
other Colombian cities. We will attend with many hopes and 
wishes for the summit not to be a summit of intentions but a 
summit of specific action that begins to yield something for the 
peoples, specific results regarding integration, development, 
exchanges. This is what we want from Cartagena. We are on its 
doorstep. This is a good time for our country and for the 
region, in particular. 
  [Mejia] Certain international news agencies have said that 
the NAM summit focused on the Latin American countries since 
they believe that the NAM has lost its strength. What is your 
opinion? 
  [Robaina] There might have been a trend regarding the 
Movement's strength or lack of strength, but today, more than 
ever, the reasons which gave rise to this important force still 
exist. I believe that as long as there is a strictly unilateral 
[unipolar] world politically and militarily and that as a long 
as the economic might is concentrated in the north, the other 
two-thirds of mankind, represented by the NAM, more than ever, 
have reason to pull together to have an authoritarian and 
forceful enough voice to fight on behalf of all. This is what 
the Cairo meeting has shown, the need for the Movement to become 
that forum of which we, the poor of the Earth, are so much in 
need.

  [Text] The more than 100 countries attending the Nonaligned 
Movement [NAM] Ministerial Summit have called for effective, 
immediate implementation of the UN resolution on the need to end 
the economic, commercial, and financial blockade imposed by the 
U.S. Government against Cuba. The final document approved today 
by the foreign ministers during the closing session of the 
summit calls upon the United States to abstain from acting in 
bad faith against Cuba and calls for the return of the 
Guantanamo Naval Base to that country. It likewise demands 
stopping violations of Cuban air space and waters and the 
broadcasting of hostile radio and television programs in 
violation of international laws. The document also urges the 
United States to solve its differences with Cuba through 
negotiations grounded in equality and mutual respect. The 
document calls for the international community to adopt urgent, 
effective steps to end the implementation of unilateral coercive 
measures against developing countries for political reasons. 
  During the closing session, Colombian Vice Foreign Minister 
Vilma Safra announced that the City of Cartagena de Indias will 
host the 11th summit of NAM heads of state in September 1995. 
During her address, Safra stated that Colombia undertakes this 
responsibility fully aware that the success of the movement will 
depend on the strength of its convictions, its unity, and its 
negotiating power. 
  Among the documents approved during the closing session, 
there are two special resolutions on Rwanda and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. In the case of Rwanda, the NAM Summit urges 
the UN Security Council to urgently take every measure necessary 
to put an end to massacres in that African nation. To this end, 
it called for arranging for all of the resources needed to 
organize and deploy UN peacekeepers in Rwanda and to summon a 
conference of all the sectors involved in the conflict. In the 
case of Bosnia-Hezergovina, the NAM summit demanded the 
immediate cessation of hostilities and the halting of all 
military operations, with the supervision of UN peacekeepers.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon from the "First Thing" </F>
program] 
  [Text] The Nonaligned Movement's [NAM] 11th ministerial 
conference attentively heard and included in the final 
declaration basic Cuban foreign policy concepts that Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina's delegation expounded in Cairo. Cuba 
terms as satisfactory the fact that the Cairo Declaration issues 
an appeal to end the U.S. economic blockade against the island, 
guarantees the Movement's continuity, and demands the 
establishment of equitable relations between developed and 
underdeveloped nations to achieve justice and equality. 
  The 109 countries represented at the ministerial conference 
urged the U.S. Government to abstain from carrying out actions 
against Cuba if these contradict the good-neighbor policy. They 
also requested the return of Guantanamo Naval Base and the 
effective and immediate implementation of the UN resolutions on 
the blockade. It may be recalled that the UN General Assembly 
issued statements in 1992 and 1993 advocating suspension of the 
economic blockade against Cuba, but the United States has yet to 
comply with the letter and spirit of the appeal. 
  During his so-called message to Cubans on 20 May, President 
William Clinton not only manipulated Cuban history with evil 
intentions but also reasserted that he will maintain the 
economic boycott against the island. The Cairo Declaration 
signed at the NAM's 11th ministerial conference also said the 
adjustment programs and the foreign debt should not affect human 
development programs, a concept that coincides with Cuba's 
views. Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina had emphasized before 
the plenary session that the NAM's number one priority is to 
sponsor Third World nations' economic and social development. 
Robaina said in Cairo that the best guarantee for a permanent 
and durable peace is to end hunger. He said: If we do nothing, 
we will be condemned to disappear, meaning two-thirds of mankind 
would disappear. 
  The conference in Egypt also discussed a reorganization of 
the United Nations so that it fulfills the wishes and goals of 
the poorest countries, which represents one of the basic points 
in Cuba's foreign policy. The decision adopted by those 
gathered in Cairo to grant the Colombian city of Cartagena de 
Indias the right to host the 11th summit of NAM leaders and 
heads of state also represents encouraging news, given the need 
to review specific problems in the region. Most of those 
problems are similar to the ones which prevail in Cuba, except 
the old Cuban-U.S. dispute. 
  The NAM's ministerial conference, which just ended, proved 
Cuba's active role in the Movement and the endorsement that its 
proposals, views, and demands for support receive in that forum.

<F P=106> [From the "Evening Information Review" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Cuban Vice Foreign Minister Jorge Bolanos said here 
in Havana that Cuba is interested in achieving specific 
agreements on integration and economic reactivation in Cartagena 
de Indias. He also stated that this meeting will be different 
from the others. It will be new in various ways, he said. 
  [Begin Bolanos recording] Cuba is attending the summit with 
an interest in achieving a specific action or project for the 
integration of Latin America. When I say integration, I am 
speaking of trade, investments, exchange in technical 
assistance, and scientific-technical cooperation. This was not 
achieved on previous occasions of the Ibero-American Summit. 
Documents were issued reflecting the wishes of Ibero-America in 
that respect, but when you analyze the agreements you will see 
that very little was achieved. Also, very little was achieved in 
other aspects. 
  Specifically, there will be an important difference. I say 
important because each scenario and each person imparts a given 
style and personal touch to the event. A delegate can have an 
idea of what is going to take place. I can tell you, for 
instance, that the event will not be the same as previous ones. 
It will be a more dynamic summit and there will be less 
protocol. I believe it will be more substantial. More time 
will be given to interviews and to debates by the chiefs of 
states than on previous occasions. There is something new which 
must be stressed. It is that, in addition to a speech by each 
head of a delegation, who will each speak seven minutes, there 
will be a panel divided into subjects. One of the subjects will 
be the flow of investments. There will be the subject of 
integration, social changes, and how to achieve integration and 
social change from the social and economic perspectives. There 
also will be other subjects. The topics will be given to a 
group. Those topics are to be given to a group of Latin 
American personalities. I think the fact that we are 
participating on equal terms is somewhat of a reaffirmation of 
the principles for which we have struggled so much, and for 
which Latin America has struggled so much. These principles are 
sovereignty and free determination. I think this summit is a 
rejection, or I might use a stronger word, a repudiation of the 
exclusive and exclusivist policy that has been implemented 
against Cuba throughout its history since 1959. It is a 
reaffirmation of the existence, strengthening, and consolidation 
of the revolution, even during difficult moments for our 
country, and even in very difficult international conditions. I 
think this is the most important aspect of the summit. [end

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Marcos Portal Leon, minister of </F>
basic industries, by reporter Jose Pena; place and date not 
given; from the "Evening Information Review" newscast -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Pena] This is Radio Havana Cuba, sir, and we would 
like to have your opinion on the trip that has taken you to 
several European countries. 
  [Portal] This was an official trip to participate in the oil 
conference in Norway, where Cuba had an opportunity to explain 
the progress we are making in our country in the field of 
petroleum. This includes exploration and drilling activities 
carried out by Canadian, French, British, and Swedish 
corporations. The activity is doing well, and we are interested 
in getting the news to other countries and other oil companies. 
Several companies showed some interest in Cuban geological 
resources and its more promising exploration areas. We believe 
we have attained our goals. In addition to this success, Cuba 
has been admitted to the Oil Congress, which was another of our 
objectives. We believe that this first leg of the journey was 
highly successful. 
  We went to London to sign a contract with a second British 
corporation for oil exploration in Cuba. The corporation is the 
British Borneo Oil Corporation. This firm will join the first 
one in the central region of the country, where there are 
already several oil wells in operation. They have shown their 
interest in moving forward with this specific project. 
  Participation of corporations such as these is based on 
joint 
risk concession. This means that there is money being invested 
that will return when and if production begins. Such contracts 
demonstrate the degree of trust these companies have in us and 
the support they are receiving from Cuba in their investment 
projects. This is why I constantly stress the risk they are 
running by investing in our country. This is perhaps the most 
significant part about the trip here. 
  [Pena] Several news agencies have reported on statements 
regarding the success several Canadian companies are 
experiencing here. Has anyone found oil in Cardenas? 
  [Portal] We completed the drilling phase at that site, and 
we were testing the well. I learned here at the Congress that 
one of the areas has proven positive. There is oil in that 
seismic structure. This was truly reason for celebration. It 
was welcomed as great news. It is true, according to official 
announcements these two Canadian companies have made. It is 
true, and we will continue our explorations and drilling to 
determine the well's potential. 
  [Pena] What kind of guarantees can Cuba offer its foreign 
investors regarding stability and professional ethics? 
  [Portal] As you may know, Cuba is ranked 29 in stability for 
foreign investment among all of the countries of the world. This 
is due to the social and political stability the country offers; 
the technical and cultural advancement of our people, our 
technicians, and our engineers; and the laws that protect 
foreign investment. These, I believe, are advantages that 
encourage people to invest in our country, despite the U.S. 
trade embargo. This demonstrates just how independent the 
companies and governments really are. It is important to us 
because it diversifies our economy, preventing it from depending 
on one country alone. All of this makes it important for us to 
consolidate our economic independence.

  [Text] Marcos Portal, Cuban basic industries minister, has 
said in Paris, capital of France, the ethics of our 
professionals as well as Cuba's political and social stability 
guarantee foreign investments on our island. 
  Portal, concluding a tour in Paris that took him to Norway, 
Great Britain, Holland, and France, has said Cuba ranks 29th in 
security for investments, placing it ahead of most Latin 
American countries. 
  Although he did not downplay the negative effects of the 
U.S. 
blockade against Cuba, Portal said the Cuban Government's 
economic strategy does not depend on the lifting of this measure 
imposed by Washington more than 30 years ago.

  [Text] Rosa Elena Simeon Negrin, minister of science, 
technology, and the environment, has said that one of the huge 
problems that Latin America faces in competing in world markets 
is a lack of scientists. Simeon pointed out in a PRENSA LATINA 
interview that with the GATT agreements and free trade, most 
products of most Latin American countries are not competitive. 
Simon added: To be able to compete, there must be scientific 
and technological support, which Latin America does not have. 
She went on to say that was the issue that dominated three days 
of debates on scientific development during the meeting of 
scientific, technological, and investigative officials in 
Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. The meeting ended on 3 June with 
a number of recommendations to the Ibero-American heads of state 
and government.

  [Text] Participants at the 20th Council of the Latin 
American Economic System [SELA] in Mexico condemned the blockade 
imposed on Cuba by the United States over 30 years ago. 
  A resolution approved by representatives from 27 of the 
regional organization's member countries urged the U.S. 
Government to lift its restrictions against the Caribbean 
island, characterizing their effects as harmful to the Cuban 
people. 
  The SELA text contemplates the need to reaffirm, among other 
principles, the sovereign equality of states, noninterference in 
the internal affairs of states, and freedom of trade and 
navigation, which are established in various international 
agreements. 
  It is estimated that Cuba has lost approximately $40 billion 
as a result of the U.S. restrictions and efforts to hinder trade 
negotiations between the Cuban Government and foreign 
businessmen and institutions.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with diplomat Omar Morales, chief of </F>
Latin American multilateral and global matters of the Cuban 
Foreign Relations Ministry, in Mexico City, by Reporter Bianca 
Govin; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Govin] Mr. Omar Morales is currently in Mexico as a 
member of the Cuban delegation to the Latin American Economic 
System [SELA] conference. Mr. Morales, although this event ends 
on Friday, could you tell us what issues were addressed. 
  [Morales] Let me tell you that the 20th Conference of the 
SELA is important, not only because it is the 20th of its kind, 
but also because there have been important parallel events. One 
such event was an important seminar. Many Latin American 
figures participated, including the five permanent secretaries 
the system has had during its 20 years. There were four round 
table discussions on the dilemma surrounding development in 
Latin America and the Caribbean; on Latin America and the 
Caribbean within the context of the new international agenda; on 
Latin American and Caribbean integration, and on the challenges 
of the 21st Century. 
  Comrade Ernesto Melendez, president of the State Committee 
for Economic Cooperation, participated in one of these 
discussions. He addressed the issue of the 21st Century and the 
challenges that SELA now faces and its plans for facing these 
challenges. It was a very significant discussion, as were 
almost all of the presentations at the seminar. At this time 
there is a meeting with all of the participating ministers on a 
very special issue -- the relationship between the United States 
and Latin America and the Caribbean. That has become the main 
issue of this meeting, as the so called Hemispheric Summit, 
summoned by the United States, draws closer. 
  The delegations here have all been probing to see what the 
various countries in America have to say about such an important 
matter as relations with the U.S. There has been plenty of work 
and the SELA reached a decision regarding the important issue of 
the contrasts between Latin American integration and hemispheric 
integration. Furthermore, they discussed the possible role of 
the so-called Hemispheric Summit. This is rather a 
quasi-hemispheric meeting because, as you know, our country has 
been excluded from the event. All the delegations here 
expressed their will.... [pauses] There are several doubts 
about the meeting: Why there is no agenda? Why and how was 
Miami selected as the seat? The lack of will by the U.S. 
Government to discuss issues such as trade, cooperation, 
investment, and the transfer of technology, which are so very 
important to Latin America. 
  Minister Melendez pointed out other additional issues. He 
asked how Latin American can explain a debt of $487 billion, 
while more than 200 million people live in extreme poverty. 
  [Govin] We also know that you plan to participate in a 
meeting of the technical committee discussing the creation of 
the Association of Caribbean States. The meeting is planned to 
begin today, and will last for three days. Please tell us about 
the meeting? 
  [Morales] We are going to hold what we expect will be the 
last meeting of the technical committee on the creation of the 
Association of Caribbean States. We are sure the end results of 
our work here will be the installation of the Association of 
Caribbean States, which will then carry out its own agenda among 
meetings of Caribbean heads of states and ministers in the near 
future.

  [Text] The Latin American Economic System [SELA] on 3 June 
condemned the U.S. blockade of Cuba during the closing of its 
20th ministerial council in Mexico City. A resolution to 
promote the integration of Cuba, Suriname, and the Dominican 
Republic into the association of Caribbean states, scheduled to 
meet in Barbados in July, was also made. The 27 nations that 
make up SELA stated unanimously that free trade contributes to 
the economic development and well-being of the people. They 
also stressed the convenience of strengthening commercial 
relations in the hemisphere. They reject the implementation of 
unilateral measures that could affect international free trade 
and urge that the economic, commercial, and financial blockade 
of Cuba be lifted and manifest their support of the U.N. 
resolution on the issue. This is the first time since its 
creation in 1975 that SELA adopts an energetic attitude against 
the United States' hostile policy toward Cuba.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Norberto Hernandez from the "Evening </F>
Information Review" newscast] 
  [Text] International sanctions are the current fashion, 
especially when it is the U.S. Government that is most 
interested in those sanctions. Any government that refuses to 
follow Washington's instructions or fulfill its demands sets 
itself on the path to economic sanctions. 
  Worst of all is that the United States has managed to 
introduce these methods in the OAS, and when a problem arises 
with any government, the first thing that is proposed and 
decided is to apply sanctions and twist the arm or squeeze the 
necks of those who are reluctant or rebellious. 
  Washington's current target is North Korea because it has 
refused to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
to conduct inspections to confirm whether or not the North 
Korean Government is on the verge of manufacturing nuclear 
weapons. The U.S. Government seems to have forgotten that North 
Korea is an independent and sovereign country with the full 
right to decide who does or does not enter its territory. 
  As for the possible danger of the North Korean Government's 
having nuclear weapons, there is no doubt that the threat is 
much less than that represented by the United States' huge 
nuclear arsenal, which no one has questioned as one of the 
greatest threats to humanity. 
  Washington has managed to make Russia, the Ukraine, and 
other 
former USSR countries agree to disarm themselves by eliminating 
their nuclear arsenals. The U.S. Government demands that 
everyone disarm, but it has not touched and does not seem as if 
it will touch a single one of its intercontinental missiles with 
their dreadful multiple-target nuclear warheads and its 
terrifying chemical and biological warfare labs, where 
catastrophic accidents could happen at any time, unleashing a 
carnival of death and destruction on the planet. 
  No one, however, has even mentioned the possibility of the 
United States' agreeing to disarm, let alone that it be punished 
for this or any other reason. The United States has the same 
legal status as all other countries, and within the context of 
international law it has the same duties and rights. Why then, 
is the United States above any international authority? Why has 
no thought even been given to imposing sanctions on the United 
States for any of the misdeeds it has traditionally perpetrated 
against other countries? 
  It is obvious that international law has nothing to do with 
that powerful state, which can request and implement sanctions, 
(?express its views), make demands, level charges, and summon or 
recriminate other governments, but does not allow anyone to even 
disagree with its plans. With what moral authority do U.S. 
leaders talk about democracy, law, [word indistinct] and justice 
when they are not capable of submitting to the views and rights 
of others? 
  The DPRK has every right to work scientifically for the 
peaceful use of nuclear energy, as any other state should. The 
DPRK Government has proven that it is not a warmongering country 
and that it does not pose a threat to peace and stability in 
Asia, as is proclaimed by the Western propaganda media, which 
are dominated or influenced by the United States. 
  The international community need not attack the DPRK because 
its government refuses to please Washington or submit to its 
demands through international institutions. If the United 
States had treated the DPRK respectfully, as the sovereign state 
that it is, if it had been fair and egalitarian in its 
international relations, it would have gotten a lot more and, 
especially, it would have earned respect it will never be able 
to claim by force.

  [Text] Niko Barkeviser, president of the Cuba Yes 
Solidarity Foundation [Fundacion de Solidaridad Cuba Si] in The 
Netherlands, told reporters in Havana that many Netherlanders 
support peoples who are defending their integrity and future. 
He said his organization hopes to increase its aid to the 
Caribbean island. 
  The foundation began through a French initiative to send an 
oil tanker to Cuba, and its purpose is to discuss the situation 
on the island, especially the U.S. blockade, but not internal 
issues which, Barkeviser said is a Cuban problem. 
  Barkeviser said his foundation is trying to increase 
European 
cooperation with Cuba. Over the past two years, the foundation 
has sent approximately 30 tons of potato seeds and powdered milk 
to Cuba and plans to help increase the 10,000 Netherlanders who 
visit Cuba every year.

    [Editorial Report] Havana Tele Rebelde Network in Spanish 
at 0050 GMT on 2 June carries a report on General Raul Castro's 
24 May tour of Youth Labor Army [EJT] camps in Camaguey 
Province. The report begins with file footage of Castro's August 
1993 address to mark the Batalla de la Sacra anniversary, during 
which he announced the EJT's creation. 
  The report then switches to footage of the 25 May final 
analysis meeting with several Politburo members, generals, local 
officials, party officials, enterprise representatives, and a 
large group of journalists. He emphasizes that "the EJT was 
primarily created to solve the lack of manpower in the 
sugarcane, agrarian, and livestock sectors in the fertile lands 
of Camaguey." Aerial shots of the farms and EJT members at work 
are shown while Castro speaks. 
  He says the EJT flag has been hoisted in 56 municipalities, 
"from the coffee-growing mountains of Baracoa on the eastern tip 
of Cuba to the Isle of Youth and the tobacco plantations in 
western Pinar del Rio," and that their unselfish efforts and 
higher productivity and efficiency were praised by Commander in 
Chief Fidel Castro at the 7th Science and Technology Forum, 
where he said the EJT continues to grow, and is the most 
productive force in the agriculture sector. 
  Raul Castro indicates that the EJT is in charge of "19 
integral farms owned by eight enterprises, which produce 
assorted crops in Havana Province. The integral farms encompass 
830 caballerias, which represent half of the tillable land owned 
by those enterprises. The other half is organized in production 
cooperatives. The two forms of organization using state-owned 
land encompass 60 percent of the area destined for the 
production of edible roots and vegetables, and the remaining 40 
percent belongs to the peasants." This means that "the EJT 
fighters are responsible for 30 percent of the area destined to 
provide these products for the population in Havana Province, 
which has close to 3 million inhabitants." 
  The announcer indicates that "all this work must be done 
despite the shortage of fuel, fertilizers, pesticides, farming 
tools, spare parts, assorted materials, clothes, shoes -- even 
hats, which are essential in the tropical sun." 
  Within the meeting, various camp leaders review the work 
carried out on each farm, the types of problems encountered, the 
efforts to find appropriate solutions, the Union of Young 
Communist's [UJC] efforts in the area. Colonel Jorge Romero 
says, "The Minfar [Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces] 
commission adapted its work to the control system used by EJT 
leaders. This allowed an in-depth analysis of the work methods 
and styles. The most evident advantages include the possibility 
of confirming results and developing production processes and 
work systems," as well as "learning about current deficiencies 
and problems and pinpointing their causes more accurately; 
evaluating the overall results rather than partial or individual 
results; being more objective in our assessment and enabling us 
to solve certain problems during the visit." Col. Romero says, 
"Officers are prepared to control all of the farm's activities 
regardless of their specialty;" adding that "compliance with the 
measures and recommendations" has helped train the Havana 
Division, and that this "will be systematically checked until 
their full implementation." 
  Other camp leaders discuss the EJT members' education 
levels, 
relations with the community, visits to the capital, 
entertainment programs, costs of food and clothing, and minor 
issues brought up by the workers. 
  Castro reviews the final report and asks that a copy be 
given to the journalists so they can review it and ask 
questions. One of the journalists says he is "impressed with the 
report because it is very specific and reviews problems 
honestly, but without pessimism." 
  In reply to another journalist's question, Castro responds: 
"We will let no one [pauses] we will act within the law, and I 
say this before someone interprets this as a threat to anyone. 
We will act within a legal framework so nothing, neither the 
illegal street vendors nor the deficiency of our government 
bureaucracy, prevents the fruits of our soldiers' work from 
reaching their final destination -- the local market, the 
people." 
  The meeting continues with reports from various Minfar 
officers. Some of them review visits to other farms and their 
assessment of the technical and material supplies, time allotted 
for travel, EJT members' complaints about meals and potable 
water supplies. Other officers refer to farm machinery, fuel 
consumption and delivery, work attendance, salaries, costs, and 
production levels. 
  Agriculture Minister Alfredo Jordan also addresses the 
meeting and says that "undoubtedly, the transformation process 
currently being implemented in the agriculture sector, based on 
the Politburo agreement, actually represents five forms of 
production" because it involves state-owned farms; 29 UJC farms; 
28 agrarian and livestock cooperatives; and 49 credit and 
service cooperatives. The sum of all this must necessarily 
increase production." 
  Minister Jordan adds: "We recently checked the integral 
farms' work during the first period, here in Havana. We said it 
was necessary to adapt an overall control system for the 
in-depth simplification process we must logically continue in 
the agriculture sector. We must change the agriculture sector 
from top to bottom. We must evaluate the work and we must do it 
correctly. We will refer to the EJT integral farms' work based 
on what we have seen here. We will also evaluate the work done 
by agrarian and livestock cooperatives, individual peasants, and 
credit and service cooperatives." 
  The official also admits there prevail "a series of 
difficulties and problems; they are part of the overall process 
currently underway. Like I said in the beginning, I am fully 
convinced, fully and truly convinced that, under the current 
circumstances and despite the limitations of resources we have, 
the number of things we can do is infinite, and the information 
presented here proves it. I think this was ascertained everyday 
wherever we went -- how much more can be done with the fuel we 
deliver, how much more can be done with the fertilizer we 
deliver, how much more can be done with the chemical products we 
deliver, and how much more can be done by the leadership to 
optimize the manpower we have. The number of things that can be 
done concerning crop production is infinite." 
  Furthermore, Division Gen. Ulises Rosales del Toro, first 
vice minister of the Minfar and chief of the Armed Forces 
General Staff, summed up the work carried out when he said that 
"this is the second work visit the Minfar has carried out in the 
Havana Division, according to the method we have created to 
periodically ascertain the work carried out by this great unit, 
the results of its production tasks, the problems it faces, and 
the help it needs." 
  He says every effort is being made to overcome "the 
shortages 
we still have and the problems which preclude the achievement of 
higher levels. This is where we must fulfill our duty to 
guarantee and support the processes and systems. We cannot let 
this production effort be limited or go to waste due to the lack 
of means that could have been obtained on time, an activity that 
could have been carried out in advance, or a lack of effort," 
because "that is our role, and we are sure the EJT will fulfill 
its role -- as it recently showed us with the results achieved 
in the latest potato harvest," which "resulted in more than 
744,000 quintals and obtained a profit in excess of 300,000 
pesos. Twelve farms achieved positive economic results. Upon 
evaluating the EJT's production results on this occasion, we 
stress that the EJT has again demonstrated its determination to 
not only produce and achieve a high yield, but also to become 
more and more efficient and feasible." 
  Gen. Rosales concludes his statement by praising the EJT 
soldiers and commanding officers for their work and dedication, 
to fulfill their main task, while dealing with the shortage of 
agricultural products.

  [Text] Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of the 
National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP], is 
attending the fourth special session of the provincial People's 
Government in the City of Bayamo. The main goal of the meeting 
is to discuss and approve the progress report which Granma 
Province will render to the ANPP session in July. It was 
ratified at the meeting that the document will be enriched by 
the people in meetings to be held in every district in the 
province. Granma's progress report includes a broad overview of 
the work conducted between 1985 and 1989, as well as the intense 
and productive effort of the entire population between 1990 and 
1994, years within the special period marked by a great spirit 
of sacrifice and commitment to solve the problems created by 
acute material shortages. 
  Granma's delegates and deputies stressed that the food 
program is in need of joint efforts, to increase the seed banks, 
the organic planters, and to use the scientific potential to 
quickly satisfy the people's food needs in a controlled and 
intelligent manner. 
  The fourth special session of Granma's government is also 
being attended by Commander of the Revolution Guillermo Garcia 
Frias; Adolfo Diaz, vice president of the Council of Ministers; 
and Alfredo Enriquez Pina, first secretary of the Communist 
Party of Cuba [PCC] in Granma. The session also discussed the 
proposed shield of the province in which the principal and most 
significant elements of the glorious historic and revolutionary 
endeavors of the province are represented.

  [Text] The implementation of revolutionary measures against 
the so-called money hoarders continues nationwide. On 3 June, 
the 5 DE SEPTIEMBRE weekly of Cienfuegos carried an article, 
entitled, Act of Justice, regarding the first nine cases being 
processed by the prosecutor's office and other entities in 
accordance with Decree Law 149. Cienfuegos authorities have 
seized from these people who attained their wealth illegally 19 
cars of diverse makes, including two Moscovits, two Ladas, and 
three Jeeps, as well as six motorcycles. Authorities also seized 
13 houses and [passage indistinct] of rice and 2,595 of beans. 
The article adds that the vehicles seized from the money 
hoarders will probably be allocated for use as ambulances and 
for other social services. The 13 homes will be used as schools 
and daycare centers among other uses, and the seized food will 
be distributed to hospitals.

  [Text] Implementation of Decree-Law 149 gains momentum in 
Matanzas Province with the start of legal proceedings in seven 
cases of ill-gotten wealth, thanks to the work of the Unified 
Vigilance and Protection System in each municipality. 
Authorities are holding, among other things: six automobiles; 
one truck; one farm; one home; dozens of head of cattle, sheep, 
and pigs; and a great number of domestic appliances. The active 
response to this law, which this operation requires, relies on 
the people's support. The Committees for the Defense of the 
Revolution, the attorney's office, the Interior Ministry 
organizations, and the Finance and Prices Ministry, in 
coordination with other entities, have joined to conduct a 
process whose last step will be the total confiscation of 
ill-gotten goods. Decree-Law 149 is supported by Articles 61 
and 62 of the Constitution, which condemn obtaining wealth 
illegally and which mars the fairness of our socialist society 
and reflects the need to strengthen control on state resources, 
as well as complying effectively with our laws.

  [Text] The current electricity generation deficit will 
continue into next week. The outages will therefore follow a 
pattern similar to what has happened lately. The Electric Union 
made this announcement this evening. This entity of the Basic 
Industry Ministry added that the situation in June is not as 
critical as during April and confirmed that Cuba continues to 
receive the necessary spare parts and equipment to conduct 
projected maintenance programs. 
  From 2-8 June, the average power output projected is 1,420 
megawatts and the projected demand will peak at times at 1,835 
megawatts. In other words, there will be deficit similar to that 
experienced in the last few weeks. 
  The Electric Union also announced that a light maintenance 
program is scheduled to be conducted on unit No. 4 of the Carlos 
Manuel de Cespedes Electric Plant in Cienfuegos. This is one of 
the two 150-megawatt generators this plant has under repair. The 
repairs are expected to take four days.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Pedro Garcia] </F>
  [Text] The generation of electricity will include a deficit 
of 415 megawatts next week. This figure is consistent and does 
not alter the normal rationing program, as happened in the phase 
ending 3 June. This means in layman's terms that there may be 
fewer blackouts nationwide, barring unforeseen circumstances. 
The Electric Union has also reported that this is an acceptable 
balance given the current situation in the country, adding that 
maintenance work scheduled for thermoelectric centrals at the 
national level continues at a positive pace. A unit of the 
Carlos Manuel Cespedes Central, in Cienfuegos, will soon undergo 
minor maintenance work. This will not affect the average daily 
generation of 1,420 megawatts significantly. It has been 
officially reported that if this pace of repair and maintenance 
in the country's plants continues, a 60-percent generation level 
will be achieved by December.

  [Text] The National Housing Institute has issued a 
resolution regulating the donations and swaps [donaciones y 
permutas] of houses to avoid illegal actions intended to deride 
the current legislation. The most frequent illegal action is 
that of buying and selling houses through donations and swaps. 
The donation of houses among former married couples [ex 
conyugues] is now regulated. The new resolution of 1994 
regulates cases of donations among former married couples: The 
transfer will not be authorized if they had no offspring and 
were not married two years. The matter will be submitted to the 
president of the National Housing Institute for consideration 
when the donations are made to legal entities. 
  The inheritance of houses through wills: 
  The new resolution of the National Housing Institute states 
that in all cases of legal entities inheriting houses through 
wills, the acting notary public will obtain the authorization 
from the president of the entity. The specialized sectors of 
the housing system will receive and diligently investigate 
possible illegal actions intended to deride the current 
legislation. A complete report will be made when the 
information received contains enough elements to suggest that an 
illegal transfer of housing is taking place. The provincial 
housing authorities will immediately take up the matter and will 
coordinate with the proper departments of the Justice Ministry, 
State Attorney's Office, and the Interior Ministry.

  [Text] Managing and supporting the implementation of the 
measures approved by the Council of State to mend the national 
economy were the main issues of the fourth Communist Party of 
Cuba [PCC] special plenum of Havana. The plenum, chaired by 
Jorge Lezcano Perez, first secretary of the PCC in Havana, and 
Finance and Price Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez, debated 
implementation aspects of Decree Law 149 on ill-gotten wealth, 
as well as changes in prices and fees, and the illegal purchase 
of cars, houses, motorcycles, and other items. Provincial budget 
revenues and expenses as well as the results of improved 
economic efficiency in agricultural production, and in the 
tourism, sugar, and cattle industries were also debated. 
  Finance and Price Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez addressed the 
plenum and affirmed that economic measures would not be levied 
on the population alone, but would reach every state entity. 
  [Begin Rodriguez recording] Work is being done to better 
control the hard currency economy in Cuba; a number of decisions 
have been made to better control this. Work is being done on the 
entire tax policy so that foreign entities working in Cuba or 
linked to Cuban capital can contribute their share to the state 
in hard currency. [end recording] 
  During the closing, Jorge Lezcano Perez, first secretary of 
the PCC in Havana, pointed out the importance of analyzing the 
state budget all the way down to the municipality, and even the 
people's council, and stressed the importance of PCC members 
explaining every measure adopted to the people.

<F P=106> [Interview with boat Captain Arnel Lopez and soldiers </F>
Norberto Duran and Misael Valentin by unidentified reporter in 
Caimanera, Guantanamo Province, date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] This newscast recently reported an attempt to hijack 
a boat in Caimanera, which was thwarted by a group of young men 
who are now the recipients of the people's gratitude for having 
safeguarded the people by risking their lives. 
  In a ceremony of thanksgiving for the peace of mind that was 
interrupted by scoundrels and traitors, Caimanera sings of love 
and duty in the voice of this girl . 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter] What made you suspect their 
plans? 
  [Lopez] Because they were asking too many questions. People 
going to do a job do not have to ask so many questions. 
  [Reporter] Questions that made you suspicious? 
  [Lopez] Because I have taken comrades to work there [as 
heard] before, and they go to do their work and that is all. 
  [Duran] We were beginning to sense their plans and kept 
glancing at one another. We all had the same idea. I decided to 
tell the boat captain: Quick Arnel, turn around and head for 
Caimanera. Right then, one of them surprised me and threw me 
overboard. At the same time, they attacked my partner. 
  [Reporter] There were five of them and three of you. 
  [Duran] Three: two guards and the boat captain. 
  [Lopez] When I heard the scuffle in the back, my first 
action 
was to turn off the motor. As I turned around, one of the men, 
the ringleader, was coming at me with a gun. I grabbed his hand 
and fought it out of his grip. 
  [Reporter] What did you do to stop the boat? 
  [Lopez] I tore the cables off and killed the motor's 
acceleration. 
  [Reporter] In other words, the boat could not be moved. 
  [Lopez] They were going anywhere with the boat. 
  [Misael Valentin] When they attacked us, the first thing in 
our minds was that they could not take away the boat. 
  [Lopez] Valentin was hit four times in the chest. 
  [Reporter] Where did you pick him up? 
  [Lopez] In the sea, the canal, swimming. 
  [Valentin] After shooting me, they threw me over overboard. 
  [Reporter] They shot at you again in the water? 
  [Valentin] After I hit the water, they shot me twice. 
  [Duran] I told him to go underwater and also did so 
ourselves 
because he was heading our way and the shot was aimed in our 
general direction. We all went underwater and when we 
resurfaced, he told me: Duran, help me, help me, I am shot and 
cannot stand it any longer. 
  Then I swam quickly toward him. At that time, the enemy, who 
was still on the boat, jumped overboard and tried to swim away 
because the boat of the Antiaircraft Defense and Revolutionary 
Air Force [DAAFAR] was approaching. But the DAAFAR comrades 
captured him. 
  [Valentin] If a bullet had gone onto the American side, it 
would have created a conflict with worldwide repercussions, in 
addition to feeding their propaganda against Cuba. 
  [Reporter] You knew that right then, you were defending your 
country? 
  [Lopez] Yes, and as many times as necessary, I will continue 
to defend it, even if the price is my life. What I love is my 
country and the Revolution, in which I have grown and lived. 
  [Reporter] All 20 years if your life. 
  [Lopez] All 20 years of my life. [end recording]

  [Text] The Moncada II-94 exercise has showcased the high 
level of readiness of unit commands and defense councils of 
Guantanamo Province to confront and repel any aggression. It 
could not be any different. Even though this is a period of 
relative calm, the enemy is combat-ready on the other side of 
the fence. The people of Guantanamo cannot forget that sad 
privilege. 
  The exercise allowed command posts and defense councils to 
demonstrate their skills in command and cooperation, as well as 
in directing operations, and the fight. 
  Juan Carlos Robinson Agramonte, president of the provincial 
defense council, affirmed that Moncada II-94 was more than a 
defense exercise; it also contributed to accelerating the work 
being done to repair the damage caused by the recent rains and 
the efforts to build over 500 homes for the people affected, 
marked the restart of the sugar harvest, and highlighted efforts 
to restore the provincial road infrastructure, for which heavy 
earth moving equipment is needed to speed up reconstruction of 
bridges and sewers.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Colonel Pablo Rodriguez Meza by </F>
reporter Marianela Samper; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Contemporary history has a few examples of armies, 
which during times of economic recession in their countries, 
have made small contributions to help their countries emerge 
from the crisis. Today, I want to discuss certain 
characteristics of the Cuban military, which throughout all 
these years of revolution, has directly contributed with 
agricultural, construction, investigative, and medical services, 
with direct links to the people they belong to. 
  Without neglecting their primary defensive work, the Cuban 
Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR] currently carry out a number of 
economic tasks intended both to reduce the state budget and 
guarantee troop provisions, with the surplus going to the people. 
  I found one example of this in the Eastern Army's Chemical 
Defense Regiment. Beside being the best of its kind in 
accomplishing its fundamental work, the regiment keeps its 
armament and techniques in an excellent state, despite special 
period difficulties. The regiment cares for 20 caballerias of 
land to boost the troop's food program. This work goes beyond 
their area of responsibility with tasks that are coordinated 
with civilian institutions for the benefit of the population. 
This work is explained to us by Col. Pablo Rodriguez Meza: 
  [Begin recording] [Rodriguez] We have participated in 
several 
assignments together with civilians. For example, the 
fumigation of several municipalities because of the recent 
mosquito outbreak in the city. We have carried out this 
fumigation jointly with the Public Health Ministry; we have 
rendered this service. We have done the same in some schools. 
  [Samper] In these cases, you supply both the experience and 
the equipment? 
  [Rodriguez] The service and the equipment. 
  [Samper] Do you have a plan to work jointly in areas where 
the environment has been contaminated? 
  [Rodriguez] No, our work it not with the environment. We are 
working with certain factories that use toxic industrial 
products; we help to neutralize these products and transport 
them to safe places. For this, we have detailed plans. We 
recently worked along these lines in the Artemisa Municipality. 
  [Samper] When you say neutralize, is this some sort of 
substance you apply or is it a protection system? 
  [Rodriguez] It is a protection system that allows us to 
neutralize the toxic products, ensure they do not contaminate, 
and transport them in containers to safe places. [end recording]

  [Text] One of this month's strategic goals of the Sugar 
Industry Ministry is to plant the more than 18,000 caballerias 
of sugarcane projected for the current spring campaign, in order 
to guarantee the sugarcane supply of forthcoming harvests. 
Fulfilling this plan will also make it possible to create the 
necessary conditions to plant no less that 30,000 caballerias 
throughout the year. This is an essential step toward 
stabilizing the seed supply.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Luis Orlando Pantoja from the "First Thing" </F>
program] 
  [Excerpts] One of our listeners, who happens to be an old 
friend, told me yesterday that she has scales at home. She said 
that she decided to weigh some of her purchases when the young 
man brought them to her from the store. She began with the 
rice: six ounces was missing. Then came the sugar: five 
ounces was missing. [passage omitted] 
  I mention this because I have precise information about 
other 
places where similar incidents have occurred. Of course, the 
rice and sugar later end in the black market. Where do these 
and other products come from? I believe they come from the 
stores, among other places, and, in some cases, from what is not 
delivered to the stores and butcher shops. 
  I am not saying that this applies to all the stores, 
supermarkets, and butcher shops because it is not true and it 
would not be fair. One cannot judge everyone alike; one must 
not use the same median to judge everyone. To tell you the 
truth, certain places are not weighing the products correctly, 
and the surplus is accumulated and used to speculate, to sell 
it, to embezzle the people, etc. 
  In fact, on certain occasions the rice, beef, ground meat, 
hot dogs -- whatever other product arrives -- are unscrupulously 
sold in the same stores and butcher shops. In some way, these 
cunning people, these thieves, are deceiving the inspectors or, 
simply, some inspectors are not doing what they should and are 
being swindled. I believe the situation which currently 
prevails in the country, the shortage, all the problems which 
afflict the population...[pauses] I believe all the staples 
should be subject to controls. The measures should be 
particularly strict dealing with those products. 
  We cannot have the same controls that we had, for example, 
10 
years ago and that were not precisely the best. It is necessary 
to be stricter now, and the organizations which have inspectors 
for that control should or are dutybound to be more demanding. 
We have ways to prevent that type of theft, and, if this is so, 
those who have the responsibility of preventing this theft are 
dutybound to do so.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Nestor Nunez from the "First Thing" program] </F>
  [Text] Colleague Alberto Pozo recently published an 
editorial in BOHEMIA magazine, headlined "Gross or Net." In my 
opinion, it unequivocally talks about certain ways to handle 
economic enterprises. Sometimes we turn our backs on the truth 
and opt for dreams or mirages. Pozo discusses in his 
characteristic and direct language the issue of the profits that 
the tourism sector earns for the country. He says there is talk 
of $700 million in gross revenues in 1993, when the important 
thing is to know the net figure actually earned and to ascertain 
that it at least approaches the median that indicates efficient 
and effective work. 
  I quote my colleague: There are examples of countries which 
earn many dollars a year in this regard, yet they have spent 
many more to earn them. Pozzo adds: This is nothing but a red 
herring, so it is not a matter of concentrating on the big 
figure. The important thing is to analyze it and learn if the 
actual benefits, the clean and absolute benefits, of that 
overall amount truly represent proof that all the necessary and 
adequate things are being done in each case. 
  Pozo insists that if our tourism sector spends more than 60 
cents seeking external resources for each $1 it earns, we cannot 
talk about an efficient enterprise. An optimum benefit means 
most of the products and services demanded by the sector should 
be local. In addition, it would be necessary to analyze how 
many employees we have per room in our hotels and how much money 
we collect from renting the facilities. It is not the same to 
attain $20,000 per room every year than to collect $40,000 per 
unit, as it happens in other nations. 
  The author indicates that the change in structure which 
resulted in the National Tourism Institute's disappearance 
strives to abolish inefficiency. Alberto Pozo adds: A 
40-percent occupancy rate cannot be considered efficient, much 
less when capitalists believe a 40-percent occupancy rate means 
the hotel is bankrupt. In fact, they close the hotel when it 
reaches a 65-percent occupancy rate. 
  In other words, many issues must be considered when dealing 
with an economic evaluation. If we only review one issue, we 
may see what truly does not exist. This is something we 
progressively assume, if we bear in mind that figures, number, 
costs, and profits were not a cardinal concern for many people 
until recently, when the belt was tightened to the limit. Then 
it was time to begin counting cents to see what could exactly be 
done with them. 
  If economic officials have to be precise and careful on 
these 
issues, I cannot but warn that the media must inform the people 
about these problems with the same care so the people's 
perception is as exact as possible. I believe Alberto Pozo, the 
dean of journalism, is giving us all a clear example of what 
must be done and how it should be done.

<F P=106> [Article by Heinz Dieterich Steffan] </F>
  [Text] Havana--To become or remain one of the "first class" 
nations, says Konrad Seitz, director of the Strategic Planning 
Department of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, there is 
only one route: to master one of the five key technologies of 
the future world market: computers, biotechnology, space 
technology, new forms of energy, and new materials. 
  Of these technologies, the most important, says Noam 
Chomsky, 
is biotechnology. 
  To this opinion of the German strategist should be added a 
second condition for admission or permanent membership in the 
First World: being an independent state with sufficient autonomy 
and political determination, in dealing with the major world 
power centers, to defend a development project based on national 
interests. 
  In light of both of these parameters, the future of the 
Latin 
American countries appears dismal. With the exception of Costa 
Rica -- which is not representative of Latin America -- Cuba is 
the only country that meets these two requisites, and, 
therefore, the only one with a good probability of leaving 
underdevelopment behind. 
  The real independence of the Cuban state requires no further 
demonstration. And of these five technologies of the future, 
Cuba is now one of the world leaders (with the United States) in 
the one that is most important: biotechnology and genetic 
engineering. By the year 2000 this market will have a volume of 
$200 billion, and Cuba will dominate a large part of it. 
  The following report presents a summary of numerous 
interviews with directors of Cuban biomedical and biotechnology 
institutions, and provides the most extensive account that has 
yet been published abroad on the spectacular advances made by 
the Cuban Biotechnology School. This lack of information is not 
due to any Cuban clamping down on the flow of information, but 
instead to the virtual censorship of reports of any success of 
the Cuban process, a censorship that prevails in almost all of 
the Western communications media. 
<H5>  AIDS Vaccine </H5>
  As in other laboratories all over the world, Cuba is also 
doing intensive work on the scourge of AIDS that, according to 
WHO [World Health Organization] estimates, has to date afflicted 
12 million people. In many countries, it is now one of the 
leading causes of death. (In Mexico it was in fourth place in 
1991.) 
  The Cuban Biotechnology School's battle against AIDS is 
being 
waged on three fronts: the development of a vaccine against the 
virus; the design of accurate and inexpensive diagnostic systems 
for massive use in blood banks and with the population; and 
developing medications to treat "opportunistic" infections, that 
is, diseases that occur because of the AIDS-induced weakening of 
the immune system. 
  The CIGB [Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology Center] is 
one of the most important centers working to develop an AIDS 
vaccine. In a 62,000-square meter facility near Havana, over 600 
scientists, most of whom are young, produce 160 different 
products, 30 of them developed through genetic engineering. 
  Its scientific staff has expertise in all of the modern 
methodology necessary, including genetic engineering, molecular 
biology and immunology, and advanced biochemistry, and it has 
the most advanced research and production hardware in the world, 
as revealed by an inspection tour of its labs and industrial 
facilities. 
  Dr. Manuel Limonta, the director of the institution and of 
its scientific board, states: "Cuba will have an AIDS vaccine by 
2000 or earlier." 
  He says they have "a working group that is developing a 
vaccine against AIDS using genetic engineering technology to 
prevent the disease." This is a "strong group" which has already 
been working on this program for "a long period of time, and the 
group has produced significant results." 
  Limonta did not describe these "significant results," but 
from other sources we deduced that they have managed to isolate 
and characterize the specific viral strains responsible for HIV, 
and that they are now in the laboratory testing phase. 
  The CIGB director expresses confidence that they will manage 
to "bring AIDS under control" immunologically, and states 
categorically: "We are going to develop a vaccine." 
  [Dieterich Steffan] Before the French or Americans do? 
  [Limonta] I do not know if it will happen before, but I 
believe it may be before 2000. That is my personal belief. I 
think it may be earlier than that, or it may be around that 
time. That is my view of the matter. 
  If it were not Dr. Limonta making this pronouncement, it 
might appear somewhat rash. But Limonta is a "heavyweight" in 
this field, and his personal achievements and those of the 
institute he directs lend authority to his assertion. 
  In support of this, the director of the CNIC [National 
Center 
for Scientific Research], Dr. Carlos Gutierrez, says that 
Limonta and his team "practically live in their labs when they 
are trying to solve something"; they are "extraordinarily 
dedicated to the work they are doing, and if they make such a 
statement, they are capable of doing it." He recalled their 
achievement with interferon as an example. 
  When Limonta, working with a small team of young 
researchers, 
proposed producing interferon in Cuba, "people were talking of a 
minimum time frame of three to four years; they did it in 42 
days--a truly record time, as everyone recognizes." 
  On the lengthy list of the successes of the CIGB and its 
director--many achieved in close collaboration with other Cuban 
scientific institutions--there are nearly 160 different products 
that have been developed by the CIGB, including about 30 
produced through genetic engineering "from start to finish"; 
these are "recombinant products." 
  To convey an idea of what this means, Dr. Limonta explains 
that "in what is known as the Third World, Cuba is the only 
country that has developed -- from start to finish -- products 
through the use of genetic engineering, which are known and 
registered products, and which are exported. Such products have 
not been developed in any of the other countries, even in 
countries that are much larger than Cuba, like China or India." 
  Just in 1993 the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in 
Washington registered three patents for the CIGB; by so doing, 
it recognized the originality of the products, and that Cuba is 
the only country with the technology and the methodology to 
produce them. It also recognized that the quality of these 
products meets the Food and Drug Administration standards, the 
most stringent in the world, and granted Cuba the exclusive 
right to produce and sell these products in U.S. territory for 
17 years. 
  These products include a preventive medication for 
myocardial 
infarction called "Estreptoquinasa" (registered as No. 
07/703,778), the first vaccine for meningitis BC developed 
anywhere in the world (07/754,918) and the invertase sucrose 
enzyme which converts sugar into fructose. 
  For "Estreptoquinasa," Cuba -- with the exception of one 
U.S. 
firm -- is the only country that has produced this medication, 
says Limonta. He explains that this product can dissolve clots 
in coronary arteries. "This medicine is capable of eliminating 
clots in a high percentage of patients when it is administered 
immediately after the infarction, and it prevents the infarction 
from progressing. So it acts as a preventive for myocardial 
infarction." 
  The patent registration for this product has already been 
applied for in over 40 countries; "They are going to grant it, 
for we know that we are the only ones who have developed an 
original process to make this medication. Getting a patent of 
this type reflects the high technological capability of our 
institution; in this case, the technology is genetic 
engineering." 
  Studies of the drug produced in the United States have 
demonstrated that its biological effect is similar to that of 
the Cuban product; however, the Cuban medication is much cheaper 
than the U.S. drug. 
  "`Estreptoquinasa' was also developed in record time. From 
the time when the idea was first conceived until the product was 
registered as a medication, only four years elapsed." 
  On the average, in Cuba products are developed in less time 
than in U.S. and Japanese companies. "We have a study, done by 
U.S. and Japanese scientists, that says that we are 1.3 times 
more productive than they are, in terms of the time required to 
complete a product and put it to use, while complying with all 
the legal requirements." 
  In practice, this higher productivity coefficient may mean, 
for example, that a U.S. or Japanese product which requires 10 
years for research and production, may be developed in seven 
years in Cuba. The explanation offered by the Cuban scientists 
for such a surprising phenomenon is complex, but they all agree 
that the educational and scientific philosophy of the 
revolution, of which these young people are the result, is the 
key factor. 
  Another spectacular success of the CIGB is what is known as 
"nerve growth factor" which "is still not known elsewhere in the 
world," says Limonta, "because nobody else has been able to 
develop it." This medication (a protein) is used to regenerate 
nervous system damage, and it "could also be useful in a disease 
like Alzheimer's." The product has now entered the industrial 
production phase, which will enable it to be used in clinical 
trials. 
<H5>  Genetically Altered Animals and Plants </H5>
  Another line of research the CIGB is pursuing is the genetic 
modification of animals and plants. To date they have produced 
transgenic mice, rabbits, and fish. Their goal is now to produce 
a genetically altered cow. 
  Limonta explains that in these animals a new trait or 
genetic 
information is introduced in the fertilized ovum, which the 
animal assimilates as its own and transmits hereditarily. In 
this way, genetic changes can be produced, and new species can 
even be created. 
  The specific objective is to make mammals' milk -- in this 
case, cow's milk -- also produce medications. "The cow is an 
excellent milk-producing laboratory. If we can introduce in this 
laboratory the intelligence enabling it, in addition to milk, to 
also produce specific proteins, then we could have, for example, 
interferon production in cows. It all seems quite simple." "We 
would not need a complex and costly industrial interferon 
production process, which requires the use of fermentation 
equipment, close monitoring, etc.; the entire process would be 
done solely in the animal. We would extract the product from the 
milk and the milk would then be used normally." 
  [Dieterich Steffan] That sounds like science fiction. 
  [Limonta] Yes, but it is going to happen. I am absolutely 
sure of it. We have already done it. We have obtained 
medications in rabbit milk. 
  [Dieterich Steffan] Do international specialists know this? 
  [Limonta] The ones who read international publications do. 
First we did this with mice to test the methodology. Then we 
used rabbits to improve the methodology and produce medications. 
That was again successful. And now we are working to produce 
medications in larger animals, in cows. We have not done that 
yet, but we are going to. 
<H5>  Growth Hormones </H5>
  Manuel Limonta also discussed the CIGB's progress in the 
control and use of growth hormones. 
  "We have worked on fish, and in this area we really have one 
of the most advanced groups in the world. We introduced the 
genetic information contained in the growth hormone in fish. 
This causes the fish to grow very rapidly; they do not reach a 
larger size than normal, but they do so more quickly, because 
they incorporate their food better." 
  The time saved can be half or an even larger percentage 
compared with the normal growth period. The fish -- in this case 
tilapia, a carp -- are still not reproducing in large 
quantities, but the fundamental step has been taken. 
  In the field of animal health they have created, for the 
first time anywhere in the world, a vaccine against cattle 
ticks, for which the patent is now being registered in Brazil, 
Argentina, Mexico, and other countries. The development of a 
vaccine against porcine colibacillosis, a disease whose 
mortality rate among newborn pigs is 100 percent, is another 
notable scientific achievement. At the present time a more 
advanced version of this vaccine is being developed. 
  In the area of plant health, the use of biotechnology has 
resulted in the increase of plants' resistance to specific 
pests. A transgenic tobacco has been produced which resists the 
Manduca septa moth, an insect that destroys the 
tobacco leaf. With this genetic modification, the moth is killed 
without damaging the leaf; this is accomplished without altering 
the plant's characteristics. 
  A potato that is resistant to one of the three types of 
virus 
that affects its seeds is another CIGB achievement. They are now 
working to develop resistance against the other two. They have 
also produced a genetically altered cabbage with a 
moth-resistant gene. 
  They have also developed a transgenic sugarcane -- the first 
time in the world that a genetically altered sugarcane has been 
developed -- to have a sugarcane that is "more resistant to some 
pests." 
<H5>  Other Achievements </H5>
  One of the CIGB's big achievements is the recombinant 
vaccine 
against hepatitis B, which is now used in over 20 countries; in 
Cuba it is given to all newborns as part of a nationwide program. 
  Another completely new product, now registered in Cuba and 
some other countries, but which is still not available on the 
market, is "skin growth factor," which is used to treat burns. 
  Some other important products include humanized monoclinal 
antibodies for treatment and, in the industrial area, new 
enzymes. One of these enzymes is "invertase sucrose" which 
transforms sugar into fructose; when fructose is used to sweeten 
or to improve flavor, the amount of sugar needed is reduced by 
20 to 30 percent. The method and technology used for its 
industrial application are exclusively Cuban. 
<H5>  Against AIDS </H5>
  On the second front against AIDS, its diagnosis, Cuba has 
three different techniques. The first was developed by the AIDS 
Research Laboratory, the second by the CIGB, and the third by 
the CIE [Immunoassay Center]. 
  In discussing the CIGB technique, Dr. Limonta commented that 
"unique diagnostic methods have been developed. For example, we 
have the `Aubio' system in which a drop of blood deposited on a 
plastic strip reacts with a series of genetically engineered 
components. We deposit on the plastic strip structures similar 
to the proteins of the components of the virus membrane, plus a 
gold-based dye. When the drop of blood comes into contact with 
the plastic strip, a change in coloration is produced, which 
indicates, simply by sight, whether the person has been 
infected." 
  This system has also been developed for use in diagnosing 
toxoplasmosis, hepatitis C, etc., and its use is now being 
expanded to other illnesses. It offers the advantage of not 
requiring special equipment to mix the blood and read the 
results, and does not even require a technician or electrical 
current, as the result is visible in ordinary natural light. 
  A different method has been developed by the CIE; it has 
substantially improved the classic method of immunodiagnosis by 
reducing the amounts of the blood samples and reagents by 10 
percent. 
  The efficacy of this diagnostic method (Ultra Micro 
Elisa-HIV) has been demonstrated in many countries, as well as 
in international evaluations by the AIDS Reference Centers 
affiliated with the World Health Organization and PAHO [Pan 
American Health Organization], for example in Brazil, Canada, 
and also in Cuba itself. 
  Now the CIE is marketing an AIDS diagnostic kit in many 
countries, which anyone can buy in drugstores. The kit contains 
a paper filter, a pipette to extract a blood sample from the 
finger, and a form. The blood sample is allowed to dry on the 
filter. The person selects an anonymous personal code and lists 
it on the form (for example, ABC 345), and then sends the dried 
blood sample to a laboratory. An automated reader, like the 
Cuban SUMA, reads the test and determines with a margin of 
accuracy of virtually 100 percent whether that person is 
HIV-positive. The person later calls the laboratory, gives his 
anonymous personal code, and receives the results with absolute 
confidentiality and privacy. 
  This system is now used in many countries, including Spain, 
where its use has been approved by the Ministry of Health and 
Consumer Affairs. The market price is on the average between 20 
and 30 percent less than the price of other products, and the 
CIE provides technical personnel and technical, analytic, or 
instrumental assistance as needed. 
  This is very convenient, says the CIE's director of quality 
control, Dr. Rene Robaina, because "when an institution -- like 
a blood bank -- needs assistance, we are there. We provide 
complete attention that includes everything from the lab setup, 
personnel training, and later assistance." 
  Another advantage of this personalized AIDS diagnosis -- 
registered internationally under the name of HIPERTEST -- is 
that the paper filter containing the blood sample can be sent by 
mail or messenger, as it is highly stable. Once it is dry, it 
will last for months without the accuracy of the diagnosis being 
altered. 
  The HIPERTEST is not sold in Mexico, but "this could be done 
perfectly well; we simply have to find a transfer mechanism," 
says Robaina, "similar, for example, to what we have in the form 
of joint capital ventures in Russia, Brazil, Colombia, Spain, 
China, Ghana, etc." 
  The test is produced exclusively in the Immunoassay Center; 
the filter paper, which must have an extremely homogenous 
quality, is imported from Germany; the chemical reagents also 
come from the world market, while the biological reagents are 
mostly produced in Cuba. The technology is exclusively Cuban. 
  At the CNIC, medicines are being developed against diseases 
that occur because of the weakening of immunological defenses 
caused by AIDS. 
  "We are working on medications to alleviate AIDS; we still 
cannot cure it," says Dr. Carlos Gutierrez, "but we can try to 
get rid of the other diseases. We know there are medications 
that have slightly lengthened the lives of patients, and we are 
trying to do that. We are investigating the possibility of a 
combination of those medications, and we are now at a more 
advanced level than laboratory testing. From the laboratory we 
then go to bench testing, then to the pilot plant, and finally 
to the industrial plant. We are now at the bench testing stage. 
If we can produce this medication, we could extend patients' 
lives." 
<H5>  More Vaccines </H5>
  The Finlay Institute, with an area of 23,000 square 
meters--unequalled in Latin America, and one of the most modern 
in the world--has 650 employees. It developed the world's first 
vaccine against meningitis, and in 1990 it was awarded a Gold 
Model by the United Nations' World Intellectual Property 
Organization for this achievement. 
  This vaccine was developed in barely five years. The 
researchers had to work with live microorganisms, creating a 
high risk of infection, as there is no other vaccine. 
  "We took all possible hygienic precautions," explains Dr. 
Concepcion Carma, director of the institute and coordinator of 
the research group that developed the vaccine, "but we had to 
work with large volumes of bacteria: we are talking of kilograms 
of live bacteria -- that were grown in large 300-liter 
fermentation vats -- and that was a real risk." 
  The first volunteers who used the vaccine were the 
researchers themselves, because "as a matter of ethical policy, 
we believed that what we could not put in ourselves we could not 
ask anyone else to try. And when we tested the vaccine in 
children, we applied the same ethical standard. Our own children 
were the first ones who used the vaccine. Only later did we go 
to field testing," explains the doctor. 
  This vaccine is now being used in a number of Latin American 
countries (Argentina, Chile, Colombia, etc.) where meningitis is 
prevalent. In Brazil over 20 million doses have been 
administered without any severe adverse reactions being 
reported. In the Cuban trials, the vaccine demonstrated an 
efficacy of 83 to 98 percent. 
  Another important line of research is the anticholera 
vaccine, which has already undergone laboratory testing with 
"important results." When the animal testing is completed, the 
three phases of trials with human beings will begin, followed by 
field testing, which will have to be done in some Latin American 
country, as Cuba is the only country in the hemisphere where 
cholera does not exist. 
<H5>  Against Myocardial Infarction </H5>
  At the entry to the CNIC in Havana, the visitor can read a 
statement by Fidel Castro: "The future of our nation necessarily 
belongs to men of science." 
  In this institution which is the leader and promoter of 
Cuban 
biotechnology, that quotation has become a reality, as its major 
achievements attest. 
  Among them is PPG [Policosanol] which combats one of the 
principal risk factors for infarction: high cholesterol levels. 
PPG, which began to be marketed in August 1991, was developed 
from components found in sugarcane, whose solutions have 
properties that reduce certain types of cholesterol. 
  At this time 200,000 Cubans are using PPG regularly, and the 
results are positive in terms of the patients' physical, 
psychological, and even sexual reactions. The medication has now 
been approved for use in 12 countries, and its patent 
application is pending in 22 more countries. Each pill costs $1, 
and the minimum recommended dosage is one tablet a day. Other 
products whose action is similar to that of PPG (the "estatinas" 
[meaning unknown]) are from 1.5 to two times more expensive. 
  They are also trying to extract from sugarcane the raw 
material to produce phytosteroids, in order to manufacture 
steroidal hormones, the basic element of anticontraceptive 
pills. The CNIC has developed the new product beyond the 
laboratory stage, which includes testing with animals, and it is 
now in the pilot plant level. 
  Another of the island's natural resources that is being used 
in biomedicine and biotechnology is Cuba's coral reefs. Since 
the Cuban revolution has been careful with the nation's ecology, 
the corals are practically free from pollution. Dr. Gutierrez 
feels that the corals, in human medicine, are "better than 
synthetic materials," because synthetic materials introduce 
molecules that may be detrimental to the human organism; so at 
least in secondary aspects, natural materials outperform 
artificial materials. 
  Scientific studies have revealed that certain species of 
coral are materials that can be used for transplants or grafts, 
due to their great biocompatibility with human bone tissue, both 
because of their ideal architecture (a porous structure that is 
tridimensionally interconnected) and because of their 
physico-mechanical and biochemical properties (calcium 
phosphates). 
<H5>  Ozone Therapy </H5>
  A treatment developed by the CNIC that is unique in the 
world 
is the use of ozone therapy in treating retinitis 
pigmentosa which, if left untreated, leads to blindness. 
With the use of ozone therapy the advance of the disease has 
been halted, and patients' sight has been improved: "We have 
been seeing patients for two years," says Dr. Gutierrez, "and 
they have not gotten worse, but improved. This has not been done 
anywhere else in the world." 
  Originally the equipment that converts oxygen into ozone was 
imported, and Cubans then developed innovative applications for 
ozone for both therapeutic and industrial uses. 
  At the CIMEQ [Medical and Surgical Research Center] ozone 
therapy is being used to dissolve components of blood clots. 
After five years of animal experiments, the treatment was 
applied to human beings. For coronary and cerebral disease, the 
technique is still in an experimental stage, but it is now being 
used for arterial obstructions in the lower extremities, as an 
alternative to dilation or laser treatment. 
  The results have been presented at international conferences 
in Vienna, Paris, Brazil, and Uruguay. 
  Another important line of research that the CNIC is pursuing 
is the use of monoclinal antibodies for diagnosing plant 
diseases; for example, there is a product that diagnoses the 
"tristeza" [babesia] virus which attacks citrus crops. This 
disease does not exist in Cuba, but purchasers of citrus fruit 
require proof that the fruit does not have this disease; by 
using this diagnostic tool, this is easy to demonstrate. 
<H5>  Medical Equipment </H5>
  For diagnoses in clinical neurophysiology (of the central 
nervous system), computerized equipment has been developed, like 
the "Neuronica" or "Medicid." The "Neuronica" is used to measure 
visual and auditory perception and brain waves during sleep. The 
"Medicid" is very useful in analyzing the nervous system and 
cerebral functions (cerebral mapping); for example, it provides 
a computerized readout of electroencephalograms [EEG's] and 
displays the results on a monitor. Due to the U.S. embargo, 
Cubans have produced all the computer programs for this 
equipment, which is now in use in Mexico. 
  The "Diramic" is another computerized device that provides a 
rapid microbiological diagnosis; in four hours it determines 
with reliability the type of infection and its pattern of 
sensitivity to antibiotics (antibiogram), a diagnosis that 
requires 72 hours when conventional methods are used. By 
indicating the most effective antibiotics for a specific 
infection, it avoids the development of bacterial resistance, 
the ineffective use of antibiotics, and fatal outcomes in 
serious infections. Because of the short analysis time, the 
small volume that it requires, and its low cost, it is possible 
to corroborate the results as often as may be desirable. 
  Another advantage of the system is that it can be used not 
only for samples of isolated and purified strains of bacteria, 
but also for direct specimens from blood or urine cultures. In 
First World countries equipment with similar functions does 
exist, but it is four to five times more expensive. The 
"Diramic" is faster and cheaper, and Cuba is now able to export 
it. 
  The CIE has developed the SUMA ultramocroanalytic system for 
the low-cost analysis of laboratory samples. This is primarily 
useful in the diagnosis of infectious diseases, in blood banks, 
in epidemiology, and for various health programs. 
  The SUMA is the result of 18 years of research, and the CIE 
in Havana, the producer of the equipment, has SUMA laboratories 
in Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The equipment is 
used to detect AIDS, hepatitis B, meningococcus, 
alphafetoproteins, etc. In Cuba the SUMA is used for the 
prenatal diagnosis of virtually all pregnant women to detect 
congenital malformations like neural tube defects and 
hypothyroidism. 
<H5>  Dengue and Cholera </H5>
  The Pedro Kouri Tropical Medicine Institute, which is 
responsible for protecting the Cuban population from epidemics 
of infectious diseases, has kept any infectious disease from 
Africa from spreading in Cuba, despite the return home of tens 
of thousands of Cuban soldiers. To do so, highly efficient 
diagnostic tools have been developed. 
  There is a diagnostic system for dengue fever, which is now 
in use in many Latin American countries, reports Dr. Alina Llop. 
This rapid detection diagnostic kit for antibodies is sold 
commercially as a kit, and this is unique on the international 
market. 
  Similar kits have been developed to detect streptococcus 
group B, which provides results in three hours. In addition, 
analyses of meningitis infections and cholera, which with 
conventional methods take no less than four days, can be 
obtained in eight hours with the new Cuban molecular biology 
diagnostic systems. Cuba is probably the only country in Latin 
America that has these systems. 
  Another system of great importance for the Third World is a 
new diagnostic tool for amebiasis which, based on molecular 
biology, has a 100 percent accuracy rate. This obviously 
eliminates the uncertainties inherent in conventional methods. 
  There are also other biomedical and bioscientific areas, for 
example, the development of computers for medical imaging in 
which Cuba is one of the world leaders. 
<H5>  Young Scientists </H5>
  The key factor that explains -- in the widely held opinion 
of 
the directors interviewed -- the spectacular advances of the 
Cuban Biotechnology School is the priority that has been given 
since 1959 to education and public health, thanks to which they 
now have a "critical mass" of young scientists of high quality, 
creativity, and discipline. 
  The human factor is actually the only element that 
differentiates the Cuban Biotechnology School from advanced 
laboratories in the United States, Europe, and Japan. All 
high-tech laboratories use the same technological equipment, 
which explains why a visitor who enters the technological 
facilities of the Cuban research and production centers will 
find the same type of Swiss bioreactors, huge Japanese electron 
microscopes, German tomographic equipment, and French mass 
spectrometers that their First World counterparts have. And the 
same thing is true for the chemical and biological raw materials 
that are not produced in Cuba. 
  The political determination of the Cuban state, the 
efficient 
network of cooperation between research and production 
institutions, the unusual combination of basic and applied 
research, as well as the strong insistence that the products 
must meet international standards of quality, are all factors 
that have contributed to this success. 
  Because of the U.S. embargo, Cuban scientific institutions 
have necessarily had to work with European and Japanese 
multinationals, with U.S. corporations remaining outside the 
commercial development of this enormous Cuban potential. 
  However, it is probable that the U.S. business elite will 
not 
tolerate this exclusion for much longer; instead, it will 
probably opt -- as it did with Vietnam -- to cooperate with 
Cuban biotechnology, and that will be the raison 
d'etre for putting an end to the embargo. 
  Cuba's continuing emergence from isolation throughout Latin 
America and Europe, the reconciliation with the Miami exiles, 
and the extraordinary internal reforms are all leading in the 
same direction. So if the cohesion of the Cuban model can resist 
for the next two or three years, Cuba will become -- with the 
exception of Costa Rica -- the only Latin American national 
project with solid foundations enabling it to leave 
underdevelopment behind and emerge from the "backyard" of the 
United States. 
  (For reviewing the medical aspects of this report, I wish to 
thank Dr. Luis Felipe Bojalil J., distinguished professor at the 
Metropolitan-Xochimilco Autonomous University, and a recipient 
of the Science Award from the Academy of Scientific Research.)

  [Text] The Salvadoran Government has offered the United 
Nations part of its Army for a future peacekeeping force, 
President Armando Calderon Sol has said. 
  The Salvadoran president has said "El Salvador is unable to 
receive Haitian refugees," but he said "what he can offer the 
world is a professional, technical, and ethical armed force that 
can be ready for any UN mission if it needs brave men for a 
peacekeeping force." 
  He has said "the United Nations knows it has a very 
professional armed force in El Salvador," adding the Salvadoran 
Government has already expressed the Army's willingness to 
assist. 
  The government did not reveal the number of troops offered 
to 
the United Nations, but he said El Salvador has helicopter 
pilots with advanced training and other military specialists who 
can contribute to the international community. 
  He has reiterated the United Nations can make the request, 
"which would be considered with great appreciation, because the 
Salvadoran Army is a professional and very technical Army." 
  Moreover, Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina has 
rejected an eventual U.S. invasion of Haiti. "We reject 
invasions of any country," he has said.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 5 Jun (AFP) -- A Haitian was killed 
yesterday in a scuffle with Dominican soldiers guarding the 
border between the two countries, General Luis Luna Paulino, 
chief of operations in the border town of Dajabon, confirmed to 
AFP this Sunday. 
  The general indicated the Haitian died from a bullet wound 
in 
the thigh when he was struggling with a soldier. This is the 
first violent death of a Haitian since the UN Security Council 
declared a total embargo against Haiti two weeks ago. 
  According to Gen. Luna Paulino, the incident occurred when a 
soldier tried to stop a group of Haitians who were returning to 
their country with a few liters of fuel. "The quickest were 
able to escape, but the soldier was able to stop one of them, 
with whom he began to struggle. The other Haitians then 
returned and in the scuffle to seize the weapon, the weapon was 
fired, wounding a Haitian in the thigh," the general said. 
"Considering that the weapon was a military weapon, it was too 
late when the ambulance arrived, even though first aid was 
provided," he added. 
  Gen. Luna Paulino also confirmed that some soldiers deployed 
on the border have been attacked, although he did not specify 
how many. "It seems the embargo is very hard for the Haitians 
and they now cross the border not only in search of fuel but 
also to take anything, a pitcher of water, ice...," he explained.

  [Text] Caracas, 5 Jun (AFP) -- Starting this week, Haitians 
fleeing their country will be taken to three U.S. ships [not 
further identified] anchored off Jamaica, and those who can 
demonstrate refugee status will travel to any member nation of 
the group "Friends of Haiti," it was reported today. 
  Guy Prim, representative for Venezuela and the Caribbean of 
the UN Office of the High Commisssioner on Human Rights [UNHCR], 
said this international organization will pay for the operation, 
which is expected to amount to about $1.5 million. 
  In statements to the Caracas media, Prim said the difficult 
situation facing Haiti makes its 6.9 million inhabitants 
"potential asylum seekers." He announced that starting this 
week, Haitians who flee their country will be housed aboard 
three U.S. ships anchored off the Port of Kingston, Jamaica. 
One of the ships will serve as a hospital. 
  He added that two commissions will be tasked with 
classifying 
the guests. These commissions will include an UNHCR commission 
consisting of 10 jurists and 10 translators and a commission of 
the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service consisting of 50 
officials. 
  Prim said those who manage to demonstrate refugee status 
during an interview will be informed about the possibility of 
going to any member country of the group "Friends of Haiti." 
This group is composed of Canada, United States, France, 
Argentina, and Venezuela. 
  Prim, however, voiced his concern that Haitians might not 
want to go to other countries because they are obsessed with 
traveling to the United States. He bases his concern on a 
recent experience when a majority of a group of Haitians who 
failed to reach U.S. coasts returned to their native island. 
  In Venezuela, Prim added, the Social Pastoral Office of the 
Bishop's Conference reached an agreement with the UNHCR to offer 
lodging to Haitians welcomed by the administration of President 
Rafael Caldera. Yesterday, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel 
Angel Burelli Rivas said his country will welcome refugees for 
as long as the difficult situation on the island persists.

  [Excerpts] Port-au-Prince, 3 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- 
Constitutional Prime Minister Robert Malval today changed his 
position and expressed support for the almost total embargo 
imposed against Haiti because he believes it is the only way to 
make the coupists relinquish power. 
  Measures similar to the almost total trade embargo were 
rejected by Malval last year when they had the support of 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was deposed in September 
1991 in a coup d'etat led by General Raoul Cedras. [passage 
omitted] 
  Last December, Malval distanced himself from Aristide due to 
conflicting opinions concerning negotiations with the coupist 
military, which in September 1991 forced the constitutional 
president into exile. [passage omitted] 
  During an interview on Radio Metropole, Malval said Cedras, 
chief of the Armed Forces, is responsible for the crisis in 
Haiti, a country subject to an almost total embargo imposed by 
the United Nations on 21 May. [passage omitted] 
  Legislators, who support the coupists, appointed Judge Emile 
Jonassaint as the "provisional president" on 11 May, despite a 
UN warning to the military to restore institutional order or 
face an embargo.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 3 Jun (EFE) -- Today Haiti's 
constitutional prime minister, Robert Malval, said General Raoul 
Cedras, who toppled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 
September 1991, has nothing to offer the country. According to 
Malval, the only thing the coupist general can offer Haiti is a 
succession of puppet governments lacking legal or constitutional 
foundations. 
  "Cedras represents Duvalierism (in reference to the dictator 
Jean Claude Duvalier). He is a good timer and a visionless 
epicurean," Malval said on Radio Metropole. He said Cedras is 
presently "cornered," adding that the Haitian military does not 
understand the crisis in the country goes beyond a domestic 
problem and is viewed by the Clinton administration as a U.S. 
foreign policy problem. He added Clinton will soon make his 
policy known to the coupist military. "Their power rests on 
rusty bayonets," Malval said. 
  He said the "de facto" government has not taken anything 
from 
Aristide because "we never intended to control the state 
apparatus." Malval remarked, "It cannot be said they have taken 
from us something we never had." 
  Concerning his change of views regarding support of the 
total 
embargo imposed against Haiti, Malval said in September 1993 
everyone in Haiti and the international community believed in 
Cedras' good faith. He added the events that subsequently 
unfolded proved "the general has no word." The Haitian prime 
minister said, "Any negotiation with someone who does not 
respect his own word is useless. The only solution is to be 
firm." 
  He added Cedras "had in his hands all of the cards for 
himself and the country to overcome the crisis, but he, 
unfortunately, confused his ghosts with reality." Malval 
concluded that Haiti is experiencing the most serious crisis in 
its history since its independence in 1804.

  [Text] Information we received last night stated that 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide had sought military action, an 
operation, as it was reported by a U.S. newspaper, to cut off 
the Haitian military power. 
  According to the newspaper, however, President Aristide said 
he would not want this force, which would come to chase away the 
military, to remain in the country. Today, President Aristide 
seems to have reconsidered his decision, or at least has denied 
having made it. Rothschild Francois has further details: 
  [Begin Francois] Indeed, in a statement just made by 
President Aristide on the premises of Trans-Africa in 
Washington, he stated that he never asked for U.S. military 
intervention in Haiti as a solution to the crisis. Mr. Aristide, 
speaking before a group of reporters, following a lunch in his 
honor hosted by Rindall Robinson on the premises of 
Trans-Africa, stated: We are not seeking a military occupation 
in Haiti, adding that if he asked for military intervention in 
Haiti, the parliament would dismiss him in accordance with the 
Haitian Constitution. The president said, however, some action 
could help free the nation from the bandits now occupying the 
political scene in favor of a return to democracy in Haiti. 
  The president-in-exile said some quick, determined action 
could be taken to chase out the military, within the framework 
of the Governors Island agreement. Aristide said he would not 
give details on what he calls quick action. He says the 
international community knows what to do in this case. 
  Mr. Aristide favors sending the UN technical mission to 
Haiti, as provided for in the Governors Island agreement, and 
his own immediate return. He also asks that the reform program 
outlined in the Governors Island agreement be applied. How long 
should the international community stay in Haiti? The 
president-in-exile stated that, according to the Governors 
Island agreement, the international community would spend six 
months, which would be renewable. We are ready to work with the 
international community to reach these objectives, he said. 
  He pointed out that the above four steps represent the 
process for the return of democracy to Haiti. President-in-exile 
Aristide indicates that following the restoration of democracy 
in the country, there would be national reconciliation, which 
would help establish political stability, necessary to progress 
in Haiti, and also that this situation would help build a nation 
based on unity and offering hope. Then Haiti would be able to 
take care of its refugees and stop the boat people from going to 
Miami, Florida. Aristide also said that when he was in power, 
the situation in the country was correct. Let us listen to the 
statements President Aristide just made in Washington, during 
which he said that he never asked for a military intervention in 
Haiti to solve the crisis: 
  [Begin Aristide recording, in English] We do not seek 
military occupation. If I were to ask for military intervention, 
I would be impeached under my Constitution. [In French] Be 
clear, because I am clear. I did not ask for a military 
intervention. I did not ask for a military intervention. 
[repeats] There is my answer, after correcting your question. 
  We are working toward the restoration of democracy, which 
implies a country where reconciliation must shine like the sun, 
where justice must be the sun that without revenge, without 
violence pleases everyone. Because from there, we can live in a 
state of law. Everyday, during these 32 months, we have tried 
our best to explore the horizons of this peaceful strategy. That 
is why, while we are pleased to see the application of the 
embargo, and hope it will be completely kept and respected. 
  We are also hoping -- within the scope of the agreement 
signed on 3 July 1993 -- that some action will be taken so we do 
not have to pay for the luxury of getting lost in statements 
when actions are necessary and indispensable, to save the lives 
of those who are eaten by pigs after being killed by the 
military, the lives of those who are eaten by dogs after being 
killed by the military. This was reported by those who visited 
Haiti within the framework of the Inter-American Commission on 
Human Rights. In this context, united with the international 
community, united with the U.S., Canadian, French, Latin 
American, and Caribbean friends, we would like to walk together

  [Text] There is a threat of U.S. military intervention in 
Haiti. The task would not be easy for the United States. 
Everything would be a surprise. The president of the 
Independent Drivers Union has unveiled a strategy to knock out 
the great star-studded power. Pierre Malvoisin relies heavily 
on the participation of the Haitians of the diaspora, Haitians 
who do not spare their help. Haitians here and in the United 
States will move in to attack at the first alert: 
  [Begin recording, in Creole] [Malvoisin] Father Aristide has 
asked for intervention, but 1915 and 1994 are not the same. 
(?The circumstances are quite different). In 1915, there were 
no Haitians in the United States; today, there must be 1.5 
million Haitians in the United States. We have....[pauses] 
there are many patriots in the United States. If the Americans 
land in Haiti now...[pauses] I do not say...[pauses] Haiti is a 
little country of 27,000 square km, but the United States has 16 
million square kilometers. Haiti will perish; it will be the end 
of Haiti. I believe it will also be the end of the United 
States because once the Americans land, our patriots there will 
blow up many U.S. buildings, in Los Angeles, Chicago, 
California, San Francisco, Florida, New York, Texas. They will 
lose many things. Even NASA will be attacked. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Malvoisin, is there a true plan 
to consolidate this work? 
  [Malvoisin] Yes. [end recording] 
  He added in a firm tone of voice: Everything is ready and 
has been set up; it only remains to wait for the orders. The 
leader of the independent drivers called the United States 
ungrateful. He recalled the U.S. war of independence. He 
insisted on Savannah. He is sorry about the fate of the great 
neighbor that has (?shouted): Bound for nothingness! Malvoisin 
does not understand that a neighbor has decided to solve the 
problems of a friendly country with force. This statement or 
firm position has come to support the argument of U.S. Professor 
Jack Tyle. He said the withdrawal of the U.S. military forces 
would be more difficult than the landing. This is a way to 
repeat Jean de La Fontaine: One sees very well how to get into 
this den, but one does not see how to get out of it. As for 
union leader Pierre Malvoisin, he will get out of it with a 
haughty head and proudly.

  [Text] The Haitian Episcopal Conference has recommended a 
meeting between President-in-exile Jean-Bertrand Aristide and 
General Cedras in order to solve the crisis. Without naming 
them, the Haitian bishops invited the protagonists in the crisis 
to a frank, courageous dialogue in order to save the country. 
This proposal was included in a message issued at the 
celebration of Pentecost. Ansy Rose Resignac filed a report: 
  [Begin Resignac recording] A meeting between the Haitian 
leaders in exile in the United States and the military 
authorities in Port-au-Prince is, in the eyes of the Haitian 
bishops, the only gesture that can save the people. They even go 
so far as to present this approach as an imperative, a divine 
proposal. The Lord has mandated it, they say in their message. 
  In an effort to invite the leaders of the two camps to stop 
glaring defiantly at each other, the Episcopal Conference cites 
as an example the meeting between the Israeli and Palestinian 
leaders, between black and white South Africans who just turned 
a new page in their country's history through multi-racial, 
free, democratic elections. A frank, courageous dialogue is what 
the Haitian bishops suggest. They are calling on the 
protagonists in the crisis born of the coup d'etat to put their 
heads together, to mutually accept each other, and to make a 
gesture to save the country from disaster, destruction, and 
death. Our people are dying; our country is on the brink of 
ruin; a foreign armed intervention is threatening to destroy our 
nation. These are several observations that increase the 
concerns of the Haitian bishops. They express their pain and 
reprobation over everything that is bathing the country with 
blood. 
  In the face of this challenge, can one hesitate about 
meeting? Can one refuse to make the gesture on which Haiti's 
survival depends? 
  The Episcopal Conference questions the difficulties of 
realizing such a meeting. Is it not because of personal 
interests? Have personal or group interests become the 
substitute for the common good? Is it not because the will for 
protecting international interests paralyzes the pursuit of 
national interests? In the Haitian bishops' opinion, in order to 
help the country find its stability and dynamism, self-denial, 
increased soul, and a burst of evangelical love are necessary. 
The time has come, concludes the Episcopal Conference, to 
transcend the self and reach out toward others. [end recording]

  [Text] On 31 May, provisional President Emile Jonassaint's 
government banned members of the resigning government of Prime 
Minister Malval from leaving national territory. The Interior 
and National Defense Ministry issued a press release on national 
television that "advises the border posts and those most 
concerned that the formal order banning departure is now applied 
to all who must explain their management of public funds." 
  This order, which also concerns all high-ranking employees 
appointed by President-in-exile Jean-Bertrand Aristide or by 
Malval, aims at officially figuring the country's accounts. The 
press release asserts that the measure is taken "in the 
legitimate interest of guaranteeing the interests of public 
administration and those of the Haitian nation." The former 
authorities must present an official discharge regarding their 
management when they leave the territory. A number of Malval 
government ministers are already abroad, according to some 
informed sources. Father Aristide ordered the same measure 
after the election, which was denounced at the time as political 
revenge.

  [Text] Jamaica will not be expected to bear any cost as a 
result of the processing of Haitians on U.S. ships in Jamaican 
waters. This is established in a memorandum of understanding 
about the establishment of [words indistinct]. The minister of 
foreign affairs, Dr. Paul Robertson, says he is making it clear 
that in no way will existing Jamaican resources be diverted as a 
result of the arrangement. He said the processing of Haitian 
refugees for entry to the United States will take place aboard a 
U.S. vessel which will be moored about a mile off Lime Cay, 
above Kingston Harbor. The ship on which no processing will 
take place will operate closer to the harbor. Dr. Robertson 
said Jamaica is putting itself on the line because people are 
dying, people are being killed every day in Haiti [word 
indistinct], and we in the Caribbean have to do more than just 
[word indistinct] talk. He says the operation is expected to 
begin within 10 to 14 days, during which time Jamaica will be 
making preparations (?with the) U.S. assembling its personnel 
after which [words indistinct] are expected to remain for six 
months. 
  The opposition Jamaica Labor Party is opposed to the move, 
but the Republican Party is supporting it. The Republicans 
think, however, that the United Nations and the United States 
(?should) do more to resolve the situation in Haiti. And the 
Caribbean human rights network, Caribbean Rights, has welcomed 
the decision by Jamaica to allow the processing of Haitian 
refugees in territorial waters.

<F P=106> [Text of statement by the Guatemalan National Revolutionary </F>
Unity, URNG, General Command; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Given the biased and confidential versions that the 
Government of the Republic -- from the president down to his 
official and unofficial spokespersons -- has allowed to be 
disseminated on this last round of negotiations and on the 
progress of the process in general, we charge before the 
national and international public the following: 
  1. That the Government of the Republic, through its peace 
delegation -- within the framework of a strong and deceptive 
publicity campaign -- maintained, during the round of 
conversations and afterward, a deceitful, incoherent, and 
harmful position. 
  It is deceitful because it has attempted to label as 
humanitarian its position, which ignores substantial aspects of 
the uprooting of communities and the magnitude and social 
trauma, reducing it to a ridiculous space in this worst and 
ambiguous government policy that is being implemented. 
  It is incoherent because it rejects society's clamor and 
demands of justice on such an important issue. This has been 
expressed by the Assembly of Civil Society, as well as by the 
URNG at the negotiating table. 
  It is harmful because it lays down as a first condition a 
cease-fire in the areas of resettlement; this is totally 
unwarranted. Besides, they know before hand that this is 
rejected because: a) It does not deal with the agreement's issue 
nor its validity; b) the areas of specific resettlement are not 
areas of combat, and when and where these are determined is 
based on the presence and actions of the military detachments; 
and c) the faithful fulfillment of the Overall Agreement on 
Human Rights and its immediate verification take into 
consideration and guarantee the situation of the noncombatant 
civilian population. 
  2. To try, as the government has proposed, to avoid having 
the Commission on the Violation of Human Rights begin its work 
until the issue of the displaced persons has been concluded is 
outlandish, and it violates the official agreements signed and 
established in the negotiating process. This vital and important 
issue was the object of a specific agreement, expressed in a 
special declaration on 29 March when the Overall Agreement on 
Human Rights was signed. This special declaration established, 
with no room for doubt and in an expressed manner, that during 
the month of May a specific meeting should be held to deal with 
this issue. Since there is no excuse or pretext to evade this 
commitment, it was agreed that the meeting would be held in Oslo 
on 11 June without any preconditions and that it would not deal 
with any others issues. 
  3. Yesterday marked two months since a historic event: the 
official signing of the Overall Agreement on Human Rights. 
Sixty days have gone by, and the government continues to ignore 
and not fulfill the majority of the points agreed upon. At this 
time, we strongly demand that at least the national campaign -- 
in which the government and other institutions had made a 
commitment to report and explain the agreements -- be carried 
out immediately and in all its magnitude. 
  The explanations or justification given by the national 
government of the Republic and internationally, alleging lack of 
funds, fall short in both validity and credibility while they 
only denote a serious want of political willingness to comply. 
  In this framework and before the national and international 
community, we demand that Commander Everardo be handed over 
alive. We reject the defense minister's explanations and 
insinuations. 
  4. On 14 May, as part of a vast military plan, the 
Guatemalan Army initiated a general offensive of a surprising 
nature. The goal was to put the URNG at a disadvantageous 
position for discussing the displaced persons' issue on 21 May. 
  The second phase of that national offensive was initiated 
today in the Ixcan area. Here is where the six elite 
battalions, including two paratrooper battalions, were 
concentrated. They have been deployed to operate against the 
communities of resistant people and against the camps of 
displaced persons who have returned. 
  We reiterate our charges concerning the consequences and 
implications this will have in the coming weeks at a national 
and international level. The URNG reaffirms its willingness to 
participate in the negotiating process with the best 
constructive attitude, but we are not willing to accept any 
distortion or coercing aimed at weakening or misrepresenting the 
contents of the substantive issues and their development. 
  UNRG General Command 
  [signed] Commander Rolando Moran, Commander Pablo Monsanto, 
Commander Gaspar Ilom, Carlos Gonzalez, secretary general of the 
PTG's [Guatemalan Labor Party], CC [?Central Committee].

<F P=106> [Communique by the Mutual Support Group, GAM, marking the </F>
10th anniversary of its founding, on 3 June; place not given; 
from the "Telepress" newscast -- read by GAM President Nineth 
Montenegro] 
  [Text] The GAM wishes to state that we have spent 10 years 
defending life and liberty. That is why we deem it important to 
reiterate our profound commitment to assist in building in 
solidarity a multiparty, humanitarian, and developed Guatemala. 
This objective, however, will not be possible if we do not 
decentralize wealth and political power and simultaneously 
reconvert military doctrines at the domestic level. These are 
the basic principles on which we can build a new Guatemala and 
create conditions to achieve a new way for Guatemalans. 
  At the international level, it requires the awareness that 
Guatemala must obtain the necessary unconditional support to 
create a true peace process, respecting our right to find a 
possible and realistic model for the country. We cannot survive 
on good intentions alone. Only facts serve as the guidelines to 
consolidate the present and view the future. By the same token, 
the relatives of missing persons today demand the willingness to 
engage in dialogue and peace negotiations. We must not create 
sterile expectations that do not materialize and heighten the 
people's frustration, leading only to acceptance and silence. 
  We recognize, however, that 10 years later new spaces have 
been opened which can permit civilian society to play a 
predominant role. This demands that we cast aside traditional 
and backward positions that attempt to throw the country 
backwards at every level. Also, the civilian society must 
assume its responsibility with seriousness and obviate outmoded 
ideas, which would have us believe that order and security imply 
authoritarianism and the return of those who years ago harmed us 
a lot. It is also important to assess 10 years of struggle in 
which our organization should have readapted to the moment, 
without losing sight of its principles. 
  Of course, the GAM views with good eyes the rapprochement 
with diverse sectors of civil society, which are not necessarily 
included within the context of the popular and labor movement. 
Currently there is a renewed form of thinking, which makes us 
believe that a common front of all sectors, including political 
parties, may exist in the immediate future to allow us to find 
solutions of consensus. We believe there is a moral force that 
obliges us to discuss significant topics. That does not imply 
that we fail to recognize that new forms of terrorism persist, 
seeking to destroy our small achievements, that perhaps we will 
have to face a new escalation of violence that will possibly 
claim many lives and intimidate others. We are aware of the 
historic moment we are living in Guatemala, and we assume it 
with responsibility.

  [Text] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio returned to 
Guatemala last night after attending the inauguration of new 
Salvadoran President Armando Calderon Sol. 
  De Leon's arrival, initially scheduled to be at 17:30 local 
time, was delayed for two hours, causing the suspension of a 
pre-announced news conference. 
  Presidency spokesman Felix Loarca indicated the president's 
delay was due to a last-minute meeting he had before leaving El 
Salvador. Nothing bad happened, he was delayed because of the 
meeting and that is why we canceled the news conference, Loarca 
stressed. 
  According to Loarca, during de Leon's visit to El Salvador, 
the Central American presidents held meetings in which they 
discussed topics related to the upcoming Ibero-American Summit 
to be held in Cartagena, Colombia. 
  We have confirmed that President de Leon will attend the 
Ibero-American Summit. At the summit, the initiative for the 
Alliance for Sustained Development will be discussed. The 
Central American presidents are expected to present this 
initiative jointly, he added. 
  Meanwhile, Loarca noted that de Leon Carpio will host today 
a 
dinner in honor of Taiwan's Prime Minister Lien Chan. Chan has 
been visiting the country since yesterday afternoon.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 3 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Honduran-flagged 
ships were found carrying fuel to Haiti, thus violating the 
embargo the UN Security Council imposed on that country, 
authorities admitted today. Carlos Sosa Coello, chairman of the 
Chairman of the National Drug Interdiction Committee, told 
NOTIMEX "there are Honduran ships that illegally smuggle Chinese 
citizens into the United States and others transport fuel to 
Haiti." 
  Sosa Coello charged that ships registered in Honduras were 
also detected in international waters carrying drugs. The 
Honduran National Congress is getting ready to discuss the 
existing Merchant Marine Law, through which a government leases 
its flag to foreign businessman who request it. The military 
controls the merchant marine, and the civilian government 
receives no income from the registering of foreign ships. 
  The military does not provide or report on the amounts of 
money they earn for leasing the national flag, but sources at 
the Congress said the business could yield close to $40 million 
a year. "We have an open registry of merchant vessels in 
Honduras, from which every one profits except the treasury," 
Sosa Coello indicated. 
  Nelman Sabillon, secretary of the Maritime Commission of the 
Foreign Ministry, said that since 1993 ships flying the Honduran 
flag have violated the then "partial" agreement to put a 
blockade on Haiti. 
  The U.S. Coast Guard Service informed the Honduran 
Government 
that in 1993 it intercepted Honduran-flag vessels carrying fuel 
to Haiti. Bilateral agreements allow the United States to 
intercept and come aboard Honduran vessels and aircraft in 
international waters within the efforts the two countries are 
making to fight drug trafficking. Sabillon also disclosed that 
the previous month Japanese authorities filed a complaint 
against the Honduran-flag vessel Montana for carrying 60 Chinese 
nationals who were trying to enter the United States. Honduras 
has to deal with complaints from the United States, Japan, 
Canada, and France that Honduran-flag vessels are fishing 
illegally in their territorial waters to the detriment of their 
fishing resources, the Foreign Ministry official indicated.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 4 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- The United Nations 
informed Honduras that ships bearing the Honduran flag are 
violating the embargo against Haiti, an official Honduran 
Government source confirmed today, Saturday. 
  The Honduran Foreign Ministry received a note from this 
international organization regarding the presence of at least 
five Honduran-flagged ships off the Haitian coasts that are 
supplying that country with fuel and other materials. 
  Merchant Marine Superintendent Reynaldo Flores said the 
ships 
were identified as "Erma," "Sea Wind II," "Aida Luz," "Lady 
Sandra III," and "Rooster." 
  Flores said "we cannot impede" the presence of ships 
registered under the Honduran flag because they are flagged for 
legal activities, and "we have no way of knowing if they commit 
illegal activities." 
  One of the ships, the "Rooster," had previously been 
detained 
for drug trafficking, the Honduran Merchant Marine Office 
confirmed. 
  Deputy Carlos Sosa Coello of the Innovation and Unity Party 
warned that the United Nations could penalize Honduras for this 
event.

<F P=106> [By German Reyes] </F>
  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 4 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- Honduran President 
Carlos Roberto Reina inherited from Rafael Callejas' government 
an economic crisis, which for a few days literally made him feel 
as if he "were sitting on a keg of gunpowder," he told ACAN-EFE. 
"We were sitting on a keg of gunpowder for the first few days, 
because the situation we inherited was very delicate, but he 
noted that (the "gunpowder") is being rendered inactive." 
  Reina, a 68-year-old leader who took power on 27 January, 
inherited a country with a foreign debt of some $3.7 billion, a 
fiscal deficit exceeding 11 percent, and a commercial balance 
that was unfavorable by some $400 million. 
  On completing his first 100 days of government on 10 May, 
Reina stated in a message to the nation that "Honduras' current 
problems stem principally from the ethical and administrative 
blunders of the former government." He also stated that 
"dishonesty in the conduct of state workers was one of the most 
serious flaws of the former government" and that "it is not 
fair, in light of this, to leave unpunished those who were 
favored by the most brazen methods of corruption ever recorded 
in Honduras' recent history." 
  Callejas rejected these remarks and said that, if Reina has 
proof of corruption in the former government, he should present 
it before the courts. 
  The president has pledged to send to prison the corrupt ones 
and to adopt drastic measures -- which will have an effect on 
the Honduran people -- to remedy the damage caused and to 
initiate the economic recovery demanded by the nation. "The 
country does not have resources, but we are making immense 
efforts and hope to push ahead," the president stated in an 
interview granted to ACAN-EFE in Tegucigalpa. 
  In his opinion, when a country has a government that is 
"absolutely legitimate, democratic, and of moral authority amd 
handles funds in an open and pure manner, there is confidence, 
sympathy, and national and international sovereignty." 
  As an example of that confidence and international 
solidarity, the president cited the visit to Honduras last 24 
May by U.S. Vice President Albert Gore, who met with the Central 
American presidents to analyze the agenda of the Summit of the 
Americas. The summit was called by President Bill Clinton and 
is scheduled to be held in Miami in December. 
  Reina admitted that Honduras' situation is difficult, but 
said it is better than that of other countries, which are "beset 
not only by economic problems, but also by violence, 
instability, and lack of political solutions." 
  Reina's government was politically strengthened by the visit 
of Gore, who expressed to the president his solidarity with "the 
government of moral revolution" that he is directing to overcome 
the economic crisis of this Central American nation, which 
returned to democracy in 1982, after virtually two decades of 
military regimes. 
  In his four months of government, Reina has implemented some 
monetary measures, which have been supported by the private 
sector, to alleviate the crisis. He has not, however, been able 
to control the spiraling inflation, which, between January and 
May, registered 12.7 percent, according to Central Bank figures. 
The prices of products have increased, hitting hard the low 
income sectors. 
  The president has asked Hondurans to have "patience" and not 
to pressure him, because he is convinced that the "vast national 
convergence" process, which he has asked all social sectors to 
join, will bring the country out of its most serious problems. 
  Domestically, Reina has also secured political achievements, 
such as the elimination of the mandatory military service and 
its replacement with a "voluntary, educational, humanitarian, 
social, and democratic" plan approved by the National Congress. 
The Armed Forces were not in agreement with it, but in the end 
accepted it out of "discipline." 
  The president took over a government plagued by a difficult 
economic situation, worsened by the electricity crisis faced by 
the country since last January, resulting in drastic power cuts 
for periods up to six hours. One fourth of the country's 
production is affected by the lack of electricity. The crisis 
has become more acute because of a shortage of 120 megawatts, 
although the government is making efforts to overcome the 
situation that is keeping Honduras in semi-darkness.

<F P=106> [From the "This Morning" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Nicaraguan Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo said 
upon returning from Costa Rica yesterday that U.S., Spanish, and 
German citizens have received over $600 million in bonds as 
compensation for their properties. The ranking government 
official also confirmed that all Nicaraguans favor an 
intensification of democracy and reject violence. 
  [Begin recording] [Lacayo] To date we have issued bonds 
worth over 600 million cordobas [figure as heard] as 
compensation without regard for the nationality of the 
beneficiaries. The only problem with foreign citizens is that 
they are subject to special procedures at the Foreign Ministry 
aimed at maintaining good relations with their governments. On 
this occasion we are dealing with the Spanish, German, and U.S. 
Governments, and they have all received equal treatment. 
Nevertheless, in accordance with the law, the Foreign Ministry 
is giving priority to U.S. citizens. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Returning once again to the 
conference you held in Costa Rica, did you agree on anything 
with Dr. Sergio Ramirez? 
  [Lacayo] I agreed on many issues with Dr. Ramirez and Mr. 
Aleman because we are all in favor of an intensification of the 
democratic system. We fully agreed on that. We all favored a 
special market economy that will foster progress and well-being 
for the Nicaraguan people, especially the poorest sectors. We 
all agreed that violence can never again be used as a means of 
achieving a change of government in this country. We all agreed 
on the importance of strengthening the conviction that a 
democratic system is the best means of changing the government. 
  We also agreed that the management of the economy, community 
projects, and production resources are priorities, which is 
exactly what the government's economic policy is doing. We 
agreed on so many issues that the students wanted to know where 
our disagreements lay. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By Mario Lourdes Osorio from the "National Newscast"] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Presidency Minister Antonio 
Lacayo described the visit of U.S. Congressmen to Nicaragua as 
positive. He said they will have the opportunity to verify the 
government's challenge. 
  [Begin Lacayo recording] They will be able to see, that 
unlike last year, the National Assembly is working normally with 
all its deputies; there is a Comptroller General who was 
democratically appointed; there is also a draft military bill 
agreed upon by the government and the Army, which is in fact 
already in the hands of the National Assembly; there is a rich 
and fruitful discussion process on possible constitutional 
reforms; and we are moving ahead to solve what we call the 
property conflict -- property that is both owned by U.S. as well 
as Nicaraguan citizens. We are also expediting the process to 
resolve the property issue through the issuance and legalization 
of deeds to land beneficiaries. We have already handed out land 
deeds covering more that 160,000 manzanas since September 1992 
when we began the program. We will end this year with more than 
300,000 total manzanas accumulated. There is also a 
compensation process, through the issuance of bonds, for those 
whose properties were unfairly confiscated in the last decade. 
With the privatization of TELCOR [Nicaraguan Telecommunications 
and Postal Services Institute], these bonds will have 
substantial backing and bond holders can have confidence in them 
and accept them easily, thus allowing land to be legalized for 
beneficiaries. [end recording] 
  Regarding property legalization for U.S. citizens and the 
effects of the Torricelli law, Lacayo said: 
  [Begin Lacayo recording] What counts is the person's 
nationality at the time of the confiscation. There may be 
Nicaraguans who had acquired U.S. citizenship and were affected 
afterward; for us and according to international law, they are 
U.S. citizens, whatever their name might be. However, if a 
person's property was confiscated by the Sandinist government 
while they were Nicaraguan citizens and five, six, or eight 
years later they became U.S. citizens, we will simply treat them 
as Nicaraguan citizens. [end recording]

  [Text] Managua, 4 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- Sandinist leader Victor 
Tirado said today that the U.S. congressmen who have been in 
Managua since Thursday "have come to pressure the Nicaraguan 
Government into altering the country's political and economic 
course." 
  "I have no doubt that Robert (Torricelli, one of the mission 
members) came to press for political asylum in Nicaragua for 
some of the Haitians," added Tirado, one of the 15 members of 
the National Directorate of the Sandinist National Liberation 
Front. 
  Torricelli, a Democrat from New Jersey, and Cass Ballenger, 
a 
Republican from North Carolina, are on a five-day visit to 
Nicaragua to examine the problem of U.S. citizens whose 
properties were seized by the Sandinist regime. 
  The U.S. "pressures" Tirado spoke about were denied on 
Friday by Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal, who said: 
"We like people to visit the country so they can see what is 
going on in Nicaragua." 
  The problem faced by North Americans, who are demanding that 
Violeta Chamorro's administration return the properties 
confiscated by the Sandinists, is the leading problem between 
the United States and Nicaragua. A failure to resolve this 
conflict may lead to the blocking of an estimated $60 million in 
U.S. economic aid to Nicaragua this year. 
  "Torricelli did not come to Nicaragua because it occurred to 
him to defend the North Americans, but to exert pressure in 
various ways for an alteration of the country's political and 
economic course, Tirado said on a "Radio Sandino" talk show. 
  The Sandinist leader attributed this new round of U.S. 
pressures to the traditional custom of Nicaraguan politicians 
who "believe in resolving every problem in Washington." "We 
must gradually change this attitude," Tirado said, after 
pointing out the need to engage the U.S. officials in 
discussions involving trade relations and investments and to 
review treaties with them and contemplate a new relationship 
between Managua and Washington. 
  According to Tirado, the presence of the U.S. legislative 
mission in Managua should be taken advantage of to "discuss 
trade relations (with Torricelli) instead of allowing ourselves 
to be strung along by his views or his pressure." According to 
"commander" Tirado, considering the correlation of forces in 
today's world, gone are the days when the United States could 
view Central America as its "backyard." "If these countries 
(Central America) allow themselves to be called a backyard, it 
means it is an opinion they share," added the leader, who also 
pointed out that the countries in this region should function as 
a bloc to preclude pressures from the United States. 
  Torricelli and Ballenger met last night with President 
Violeta Chamorro, but after the meeting they refused to talk to 
reporters. The U.S. congressmen also met with Managua Archbishop 
Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo and this weekend will pursue an 
agenda of meetings with representatives from various sectors. 
  The Association of Nicaraguan-American Owners of Confiscated 
Property [Asociacion de Confiscados Americanos de Nicaragua], 
formed by 650 Nicaraguan-Americans, is demanding the return of 
1,400 properties valued at approximately $600 million. Roberto 
Vassalli, president of the association, told reporters that in 
four years the Chamorro administration has only resolved 20 
claims "to the full satisfaction" of the organization's members. 
  On 29 April the "Helms-Gonzalez" amendment went into effect 
in the United States; this amendment establishes a 30 July 
deadline before which all countries must return confiscated 
properties to U.S. citizens. 
  Vassalli said that the association also supports thousands 
of 
Nicaraguans who are demanding the return of properties seized by 
the Sandinists during the past decade.

<F P=106> [Report by Vilma Estrada; from the "National Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] President Violeta Chamorro, upon returning from El 
Salvador, reported that high-ranking U.S. Government officials 
cite Nicaragua as an example of democratic transition in the 
Central American region. She flew to San Salvador to attend the 
inauguration of President Armando Calderon Sol. President 
Violeta Chamorro said she met with Strobe Talbott, U.S. under 
secretary of state, and Alexander Watson, assistant secretary of 
state for inter-American affairs. The U.S. officials requested 
her support for the U.S. initiatives at the United Nations and 
OAS directed at restoring democracy in Haiti, because Nicaragua 
is an example of democracy. This opinion is shared by the other 
officials with whom she met during her visit. 
  [Begin Chamorro recording] Everyone looks positively at 
Nicaragua and its people. I held interviews with 
representatives of the United States, China, Spain, and many 
other countries. All of them said: Dona Violeta, we 
congratulate you for your good administration. I have heard 
many expressions of support and received many ovations, which I 
sincerely believe are for the Nicaraguan people. [end recording] 
  When asked about the U.S. request for support in receiving 
Haitian refugees, she said that her colleagues in the region are 
studying the situation and will respond during the December 
Summit of the Americas in Miami. 
  [Begin Chamorro recording] I believe that working together 
or alone to find well-being for Haiti is worthwhile. I remember 
perfectly well when members of the Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front came and asked me: What can we do, Dona 
Violeta, to start talks in El Salvador and find peace there? I 
told them that the best way was to try, and now they have peace. 
That is what they told me. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Jorge Katin] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday, the Sandinist Assembly made an fervent 
call to the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] grass 
roots to "unite around revolutionary objectives within the 
framework of decisions taken by the [FSLN National] Congress to 
set an example of flexibility by rejecting malicious traps, 
intolerance, and to strengthen camaraderie as well as 
constructive criticism." 
  The Sandinist Assembly, recently elected during the party's 
congress, met yesterday for the first time and proceeded to 
discuss the results of the elections, to select members of the 
Ethics and Judicial Commission, to elect a permanent Electoral 
Commission, to appoint three secretaries to the National 
Directorate, and to establish five work commissions. 
  Likewise, the assembly discussed issues such as a public 
debate on the results of the Sandinist congress and the thorny 
controversy of the media's support to Sandinism, especially the 
case of BARRICADA. 
  The new members of the Judicial and Ethics Commission 
include 
Miguel Angel Casco, Orlando Tardencilla, Onofre Guevara, Jose 
Pasos, Gladis Gomez, Yadira Centeno, Jorge Samper, Bruno 
Gallardo, Gloria Hernandez, Erwin Izaba. 
  The Electoral Commission includes Julian Corrales 
(president), Jeannete Chavez, Zadrach Zeledon, Ruth Herrera, and 
Jose Luis Villavicencio as principal members, and Edwin Castro 
as well as Josefina Ramos as alternates. 
  As has already been reported by BARRICADA, Monica Baltodano, 
Lumberto Campbell, and Victor Hugo Tinoco were elected 
secretaries of organization and education, communications, and 
international relations respectively. 
  Likewise, the Sandinist Assembly approved the creation of 
other commissions such as an agriculture commission, a youth 
commission, a women's commission, an Atlantic coast commission, 
and an economic-social commission. 
  Upon concluding the event, FSLN Deputy Secretary General 
Tomas Borge said that with respect to the media issue, it had 
been decided to "assess the situation" within the National 
Directorate, and to present a proposal afterwards before the 
Sandinist Assembly. 
  With respect to the debate to take place after the congress, 
it was confirmed the debate would be "free, open, and within the 
framework of the organizations members of the FSLN." 
  The absence of National Directorate member Henry Ruiz was 
quite obvious. Ruiz has abstained from participating in any of 
the meetings of the newly elected national directorate. 
<H5>  Calls for Penalties and More Media Control </H5>
  The issue of the public debate over the congress results, 
and 
the role of the media was included as part of the agenda under 
"other issues." Discussions began when Modesto Mungia, an 
assembly member and Managua District Three leader, stated that 
the media could be useful as instruments to continue "examining" 
the problem of divisions within the FSLN. 
  On the other hand, Felix Contreras pointed out that not only 
is the legitimacy of the congress under attack, but that "groups 
are organized to further split the FSLN." As an example, he 
pointed to a recent call to all Sandinists professionals to 
participate in an assembly scheduled to take place next Tuesday 
at the UCA [Central American University]. 
  William Grisgbi urged the National Directorate to "state its 
position on the scope of action of journalists, and 
responsibilities as assemblymen." Grisbi was referring to the 
controversy involving BARRICADA Director Carlos Fernando 
Chamorro and Danilo Aguirre, EL NUEVO DIARIO deputy director. 
  Nelson Artola, a San Ramon municipal leader asked "Who owns 
BARRICADA?" and immediately urged the FSLN to appropriate the 
media. 
  "We must penalize those comrades who are manipulating the 
results of the Congress, and we should do it with a steady hand 
and voice," Elias Chavez suggested. 
  In the meantime, National Directorate member Luis Carrion 
pointed out that "Neither the Assembly or the National 
Directorate should become media directors." In his opinion, 
overseeing mechanisms such as a directors council similar to the 
one operating at BARRICADA must be encouraged. 
  Nevertheless, Carlos Fonseca Teran insisted that "the 
problem 
lies in the clear intent to tarnish the congress' results." 
  In this respect, the harshest criticisms were directed at 
Sandinist Assembly member Danilo Aguirre, who is also EL NUEVO 
DIARIO deputy director. 
  Monica Baltodano, also a National Directorate member, urged 
all to "grab the bull by its horns," and that all those whom -- 
it would seem -- are attempting to "give a free rein to their 
ideas" should be called in and urged to speak clearly. 
  The controversy seemed to lose steam when BARRICADA Editor 
Carlos Fernando Chamorro addressed the assembly and indicated 
that this newspaper had been one of the few to cover the debates 
prior to, as well as following the congress. He also contended 
that the debate had been treated as taboo by the other media 
associated with Sandinism. 
  "Let's put the subject of the other media that did not cover 
the debate on the carpet," Chamorro pointed out. 
  Nevertheless, former BARRICADA sports director Emmett Lang 
restarted the controversy when he asked "what was the problem 
with suggesting Carlos Fernando's departure if he has already 
occupied the position for the past 14 years." Lang immediately 
added that "I am aware that because of this suggestion I will be 
attacked in tomorrow's edition of BARRICADA."

1994 on page 3A reports that Higher Council of Private 
Enterprise (Cosep) President Ramiro Gurdian would be "willing" 
to be the National Conservative Party's candidate for president 
of Nicaragua in 1996. In his appearance on Channel 2's "Buenos 
Dias" program, Gurdian criticized the executive branch for being 
slow to resolve the property issue. In contrast, he cited 
examples of cases being resolved quickly under U.S. pressure. 
Gurdian related the accusations he had heard from peasants that 
military personnel are carrying out attacks in the north. With 
regard to the Sandinist National Liberation Front (FSLN), he 
explained that Cosep is interested in a dialogue with the FSLN 
"in order to seek concrete solutions for Nicaragua," but that 
this should "in no way be interpreted as seeking an alliance 
with Sandinism."

    [Editorial Report] Managua LA TRIBUNA in Spanish on 12 May 
1994 on page 7B reports that the Ministry of Agriculture and 
Livestock [MAG] is projecting a 4.3 percent increase in 
production for 1994-95 compared to the previous cycle. 
Approximately 660,000 manzanas will be planted in basic grains, 
including rice, corn, beans, sorghum, and soybeans, while 
226,000 manzanas will be planted in products for export. Coffee 
will remain at the same level as last year -- 105,000 manzanas. 
Although the price of cotton has risen from $58 to $82 per 
quintal, only 5,000 manzanas of cotton will be planted, yielding 
32 quintals per manzana. The article explains that production 
results will depend on timely government financing, estimated at 
$260 million from international financial organizations; respect 
for private property; and international market prices for 
exports.

  [Text] President Guillermo Endara Galimany said that if the 
United States decides to invade Haiti to remove General Raoul 
Cedras and his men from power, he will not support it, but if it 
takes place he would not condemn it either. 
  Questioned by numerous journalists at the Yellow Room of the 
Presidential Palace after signing the Chapultepec Declaration, 
Endara said he believes the invasion of Panama in December 1989 
did not take place because of a right or a duty. 
  "We did not ask for the invasion... it took place... 
historic 
situations, which will be up to analysts to study." 
  According to the Panamanian president, between Haiti and 
Panama, there are distant but similar conditions, which he 
discussed with U.S. Vice President Al Gore during a recent 
dinner in Tegucigalpa. 
  He noted that on that occasion Gore said Haitian President 
Jean Bertrand Aristide won his country's elections with 70 
percent of the votes, a similar percentage with which he 
(Endara) won the 1989 elections from his opponent, Carlos Duque 
from the National Liberation Coalition. 
  "I am not calling for an invasion of Haiti, but I do not 
exclude it either," the president said. When asked again if he 
would support an invasion, he said no, but that if the United 
States invades the island, he will not condemn it.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Guillermo Endara at ceremony bidding </F>
farewell to the U.S. 193d Infantry Brigade (Light) at Fort 
Clayton; broadcast in progress--live relay, with 
passage-by-passage translation into English] 
  [Text] ...these obligations also included the operations 
of the military bases in the canal area. My government has 
strived to comply to the letter with the 1977 treaties; this is 
why the creation of the Interoceanic Region Authority reflects 
our concern to design and establish an efficient system leading 
to the best use of the reverted and soon to be reverted areas. 
  Moreover, we have begun to adopt the necessary steps to 
ensure that the administration of the canal, of which we will 
formally and completely assume control by the end of the 
century, will continue to operate with the same degree of 
reliability that it has had during its entire existence. 
  Today's ceremony is nothing more than an irrefutable and 
palpable demonstration of the United States' willingness to also 
fully comply with the commitments acquired under the canal 
treaties. 
  We have gathered here to witness a very important and 
historic event. After 32 years in Panamanian territory, the 
193d Infantry Brigade will be leaving our homeland. It is the 
last combat infantry unit that will be leaving Panama. Memories 
of missions accomplished and friendships cultivated will remain. 
  With the permission of the translator, I will briefly refer 
to one of the missions accomplished by one of the battalions of 
the brigade. In three days, on 6 June, we will be marking the 
50th anniversary of the allied invasion of Normandy, which 
marked the beginning of the end of Nazi tyranny in Europe. This 
brigade's Paratroopers Battalion had the great honor--and we 
have the great honor of being here with it today--of 
participating as one of the first teams that entered territory 
occupied by the Nazis before the invasion per se. With great 
pride of being here with heroes to whom we owe freedom the world 
over, I give you a special salute on this day when you are 
leaving our homeland. 
  There are new horizons in the future for those who will be 
leaving and for those of us who will remain. I am certain 
members of this brigade and members of the Armed Forces who will 
follow them through 1999 will find new challenges and new paths 
to serve their country. 
  This is why our words of farewell contain a goodbye full of 
the best wishes for the men of arms who are leaving today. The 
citizens of this country, who will now gradually assume 
possession of high-value property, have a very serious challenge 
ahead. Our main goal is to ensure the entire canal area will 
become a center that will attract activities that will produce 
benefits for the rest of the country. In this manner, the 
wealth generated by this area will be spread throughout the 
Republic, especially to the benefit of the poorest and most 
needy segments of the population. 
  I am pleased my government has established the bases to 
ensure the materialization of this distribution of justice in 
our country. Future generations of Panamanians will enjoy the 
benefits of so many meritorious plans we are implementing. They 
must recall that all of this is possible thanks to a clear and 
friendly policy of full compliance with the 1977 treaties 
between our two countries. Today's ceremony is evidence of this 
policy. 
  To those who leave Panamanian soil today, I say: Goodbye, 
may God be with you. I hope you always remember with warmth the 
experience in our homeland. [applause]

<F P=106> [Report by Ciro Ortega; from the "RPC Television News" </F>
newscast; passages within quotation marks recorded] 
  [Excerpts] The 193d Infantry Brigade has completed 32 years 
of defense operations in Panama. It began its redeployment 
today from Panama, where the U.S. Army Southern Command is 
headquartered. The ceremony took place at Fort Clayton. The 
ceremony highlighted the brigade's decisive military action in 
Europe during World War II. The 193d had also participated in 
1989's Operation Just Cause, which ended with the capture of the 
Central Headquarters of the Panama Defense Forces. [passage 
omitted] 
  President Guillermo Endara Galimany outlined the challenge 
that lies ahead, saying the task is to transform the Panama 
Canal area into a magnet that attracts activities that can be 
beneficial to the entire country. He told the press this is a 
very significant event, but the historic encounter of 31 
December 1999 is yet to come. 
  [Endara] "The events of 31 December will be even more 
significant; it will be both sad and happy, because the last 
U.S. soldier will be leaving." 
  President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares was clear in saying 
the departure of the 193d Infantry Brigade from Panama is 
essential for the fulfillment of the Panama Canal Treaty. 
  [Perez Balladares] "We must ensure there will be no further 
military presence in Panama after 31 December 1999. I believe 
this is a clear demonstration of both countries' positive 
intentions to fulfill our commitment." 
  Carlos Mendoza, a member of the Interoceanic Region 
Authority 
[ARI], reaffirmed that the gradual retreat of U.S. troops from 
Panama is a definitive step established by the Canal Treaty. He 
added the assets that will revert to Panamanian jurisdiction 
will be honestly and properly administrated, thanks to the 
organization created specifically for that task. 
  [Mendoza] "The plans we have include the reversion of Fort. 
Espinar, or what remains of Espinar to revert, Fort. Davis and 
Fort. Amador, the reversion of which will occur next year. In 
addition, as I have outlined in Coco Solo, we will soon have the 
container port for Colon." 
  The number of U.S. troops stationed in Panama will be 
reduced 
over the next 18 months, from 11,000 to 6,000, and many forts 
and other valuable assets will revert to Panamanian 
jurisdiction. The process will conclude on 31 December, 1999.

  [Text] The Panama Canal Treaties 
  In September 1977 the United States and the Republic of 
Panama signed two new treaties and thus embarked on a consortium 
to administer, operate and defend the Panama Canal. The Panana 
Canal Treaty of 1977 regulates the operation, administration, 
and defense of the canal until midday on 31 December 1999. On 
that date the Panama Canal will revert to Panama and the U.S. 
military presence in Panama will end. After that date, only 
Panama will maintain forces on its national territory. The 
other treaty, the Treaty of Neutrality and Operation of the 
Panama Canal, establishes the permanent neutrality of the canal 
for an indefinite period; it pledges that Panama and the United 
States will continue defending the canal and will ensure its 
permanent neutrality after the Panama Canal Treaty expires. 
  Both treaties were approved by Panama in a plebiscite on 23 
October 1977, and the U.S. Senate gave its consent for 
ratification in March and April 1978. With the treaties taking 
effect on 1 October 1979, the Canal Zone and the Canal Zone 
Government were dissolved; the Panama Canal Company was replaced 
by the bi-national Panama Canal Commission; and Panama assumed 
general territorial jurisdiction over what until then had been 
the Canal Zone. The treaties also replaced the 1903 treaty 
between the United States and Panama (Hay/Bunau-Varilla Treaty), 
which regulated the operation and defense of the canal from the 
time of its construction (which concluded in 1914), and its 
subsequent amendments through the 1936 and 1955 treaties. 
  The Panama Canal Treaty assigns to the United States primary 
responsibility for the canal's defense until 1999. It grants 
the United States the right to maintain its military quarters 
and Armed Forces in Panama. These base rights will end when the 
treaty expires. 
<H5>  Initial Efforts in the Execution of the Treaty </H5>
  Comprehensive planning for the total withdrawal of U.S. 
military forces from Panama began in 1986, which led to the 
creation of the Preliminary Plan for the Execution of the 
Treaty. This plan was an initial draft for the orderly and 
gradual withdrawal of U.S. forces from Panama by the end of the 
century and the transfer of their military installations and 
other facilities to the Panamanian government. Approval of the 
Treaty Implementation Plan was given by the U.S. assistant 
secretary of defense in February 1988 and the plan's preliminary 
structure was developed during the early months of 1989. These 
preliminary plans by the U.S. Department of Defense for the 
execution of the treaty were interrupted by the political crisis 
during the final part of the Noriega regime and by Operation 
Just Cause. Once Panama's democratic government was restored, 
the United States resumed planning of the transfer process. 
<H5>  Approval of the Treaty Implementation Plan </H5>
  The Panama Canal Treaty Implementation Plan (PC-TIP in 
English), approved by the defense secretary on 3 February 1993, 
supersedes the preliminary plan for the implementation of the 
treaty and provides a conceptual guide and path for all the U.S. 
Defense Department agencies to implement the Panama Canal 
Treaty, in other words, to undertake in an orderly manner the 
gradual withdrawal of the 10,000 U.S. troops stationed in Panama 
and the reversion to Panama of the U.S. military installations 
and facilities by the end of 1999. 
  The PC-TIP was developed by the Southern Command 
headquarters 
and its different components (Army, Air Force, Navy, and 
Marines), jointly with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Defense 
Secretary's Office. The Department of the Army was appointed 
executing agent to coordinate subsequent plans and those 
logistical and financial requirements that are not unique to a 
specific military component. The Treaty Implementation Center of 
the Southern Command coordinates the plans for the continual 
implementation of the treaties. The center is the liaison of 
the Southern Command with the executing agent of the TIP 
(planning agency of the Panama Canal Treaty within the 
Department of the Army's headquarters), the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the U.S. Embassy 
in Panama, and the Panamanian Government for treaty 
implementation affairs. 
<H5>  Previously Transferred Military Properties </H5>
  Several military properties were reverted to the Panamanian 
Government from 1979 to 1984, in compliance with the specific 
dates stipulated in the Panama Canal Treaty and related 
documents. There are no specific obligatory dates for reversion 
before 1999 of the 10 remaining major military installations and 
several other military facilities located outside these 
installations. From 1979 to the end of 1993, a total of 405 
buildings (including 113 housing units) and 16,000 acres of land 
with their infrastructure of roads, water and power systems, 
fences, etc., have been transferred to Panama. 
  The remaining military facilities to be transferred to 
Panama 
by the end of 1999 encompass a total of 4,290 buildings located 
on approximately 77,000 acres of land. 
<H5>  Working Jointly With Panama </H5>
  Since 1990, planning has included meeting with key 
Panamanian 
Government authorities in order to ensure an effective 
transition up until the end of 1999. In 1992, the U.S. Southern 
Command began to organize tours for the Panamanian authorities 
to the main military installations and facilities in order to 
provide a better idea of the magnitude of the structures to be 
turned over to Panama. In April 1992, the office responsible 
for coordinating the treaty execution plan was presented to the 
Panamanian Government. 
  A Joint Planning Group established in 1992 in Panama meets 
regularly in order to discuss issues related to the day-to-day 
planning of treaty implementation. The U.S. Southern Command 
continues to work closely with the Panamanian authorities 
through the Joint Planning Group, the Interoceanic Region 
Authority (ARI), and the Panama Treaty Affairs Executive 
Directorate (DEPAT), which falls under the Foreign Relations 
Ministry. The DEPAT was created in 1993 in order to develop the 
best conditions for a successful transfer of the aforementioned 
facilities. 
<H5>  Transfers and Short-Term Reductions </H5>
  During 1992, while continuing with implementation plans by 
the three U.S. Southern Command service branches (that provide a 
detailed plan of the components to be executed by the PC-TIP), 
on 14 January 1993, the Department of Defense and the U.S. 
Southern Command announced the short-term transfer (1993-1995) 
of military assets to the Panamanian Government and the 
reduction of military personnel associated with this activity. 
  The military facilities scheduled to be transferred by the 
end of 1995, together with personnel reductions, includes Fort 
Amador and the Curundu housing area, on the Pacific side, and 
the rest of Fort Espinar (know before as Fort Gulick) and Fort 
Davis, as well as the rest of Coco Solo, including the Cristobal 
High School, on the Atlantic side. 
  Another significant building transfer is scheduled to take 
place on 31 May 1994 when the Coco Solo Medical Clinic (better 
known as the Coco Solo medical complex) will be turned over to 
the Panamanian Government during an official ceremony (through 
the ARI). The same complex will immediately be turned over to 
the Panamanian Social Security Fund, which will convert it into 
a social security hospital on the Atlantic side. 
  At present the PC-TIP calls for a 40 percent reduction of 
military personnel by the end of 1995, which means that the 
number of U.S. troops currently in Panama will be reduced from 
10,000 to approximately 6,000. Consequently, the number of 
military families in Panama will also be reduced by 
approximately 3,000. 
  The number of troops will be reduced through the reduction, 
relocation, and deactivation of units. Army South's 193d Light 
Infantry Brigade will be deactivated in October 1994, and other 
Army units will also be reduced. The Air Force, Navy, and 
Marine Infantry will remain basically intact during this period. 
  The first large-scale reduction of forces will take place at 
the farewell ceremony on 3 June 1994 for the 193d Light Infantry 
Brigade at Fort Clayton. By the end of 1995, there will be 
reductions in the Army, Navy, and Marine Infantry to bring their 
numbers to approximately 6,000 troops. 
  The remaining U.S. military personnel will eventually be 
consolidated at the few remaining military installations as the 
units withdraw from Panama or are deactivated. Most of the U.S. 
forces will be consolidated at Howard Air Force Base, Rodman 
Naval Station, and Fort Kobbe (known as the HOROKO complex) at 
the entrance to the Panama Canal on the Pacific side, with a 
small force on the Atlantic side. These troops' withdrawal from 
Panama will be completed by the end of 1999, and the 
installations are scheduled for reversion to Panama at a 
relatively uniform pace during the four final years of the 
Panama Canal Treaty. 
<H5>  Relocation of the Southern Command General Headquarters </H5>
  Thus far the place and date of the Southern Command General 
Headquarter's relocation is still unknown. The process of 
relocating a general headquarters is very complex and could 
generate very costly military construction. The Department of 
Defense is still studying this phase and considering 
alternatives. Nevertheless, the Southern Command General 
Headquarters will be relocated during the time remaining in the 
treaty.

  [Text] A Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) source 
reported that during his trip to the United States Foreign 
Relations Minister-Designate Gabriel Lewis Galindo discussed 
possible joint actions between the two governments to fight drug 
trafficking and money laundering. 
  According to the source, Lewis Galindo also discussed the 
possibility of Panama's joining the North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA). The source said that Galindo met with 
President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares to deliver a detailed 
report on his discussions with the U.S. Government. It was 
learned that one of the points most discussed by Galindo and 
U.S. authorities was the establishment of possible formulas to 
fight drug-money laundering. 
  He said that the U.S. authorities are concerned about 
Panama's image abroad as a money laundering center through its 
banking centers. The source said that another topic discussed 
was the reduction of U.S. troops in Panamanian territory. 
Likewise, the source reported that Perez Balladares will today 
travel to Bocas del Toro Province where he will announce a 
series of government investments he plans to implement after he 
takes office in September.

  [Text] The Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) yesterday 
released the results of a poll by the "Artaki" enterprise that 
shows that 74.7 percent of the Panamanians interviewed approve 
of President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares' work up to now. 
The poll, which was conducted between 27 and 29 May, was done 
through social-level samplings, with 774 people interviewed in 
Panama and San Miguelito Districts. 
  According to a PRD press release, most of the people 
interviewed approve of Perez Balladares' activities as Panama's 
president-elect, while 22.7 percent of those polled disapprove. 
On his choice of cabinet members, the poll indicates that 62.7 
percent agree with the appointments, while 27.3 percent disagree. 
  In another arena, the poll disclosed that 70.4 percent of 
those interviewed believe that general living conditions in 
Panama will improve, while 25.7 percent believe they will 
worsen. A news bulletin states that the poll results are the 
first since the 8 May elections. The bulletin adds that the 
public opinion poll gives the president-elect "a vote of 
confidence" and offers him a letter of credit.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Jose Mulino requested yesterday the 
support of countries in the Nonaligned Movement (NAM) for Panama 
to be given the seat of the next NAM heads of state summit in 
1999, to "show to the world the country that is to manage the 
Canal in the next century." 
  Mulino made this request during his main speech before the 
11th NAM Foreign Relations Ministers meeting currently being 
held in Cairo, Egypt. 
  "I hope my successors at the foreign ministry will support 
and honor Panama's request to be the seat of the NAM heads of 
state summit in 1999," Mulino emphasized. 
  The foreign minister added in his speech that, if this 
request is granted, Panama will secure its most important 
commitment to the world. 
  Mulino called on all NAM member countries to prepare and 
back 
the initiative unanimously as a homage to the Panamanian people. 
  "We advance, without having any time to loose or any margin 
for errors, toward the historic commitment of receiving the 
Panama Canal on 31 December 1999," Mulino added.

<F P=106> [Report by Juan Manuel Diaz C.] </F>
  [Text] President Guillermo Endara has confirmed that Panama 
must conclude the process of integration with Central American 
and through this process achieve induction into the North 
American Free Trade Agreement [NAFTA] among the United States, 
Mexico, and Canada. Endara said that the Central American 
countries could make economic arrangements with the North 
American countries to gain entry to NAFTA. 
  According to Endara, efforts to consolidate Panama's 
integration with Central America have continued and should be 
pursued by the next administration. President Endara was 
critical of remarks by members of the new administration, who 
said that Panama should attempt to gain entry into NAFTA before 
achieving integration with Central America. He said that 
considerable progress has not yet been made with regard to 
integration with the Caribbean countries, but that some efforts 
have been made with the Dominican Republic. 
  Among the most important steps taken to achieve Panama's 
integration with Central America was the creation of the Central 
American Integration System (SICA), which embodies the 
organizations, institutions, and commissions for integration. 
  The SICA was established as the legal regional integration 
organization with which all the countries would conduct 
consultations concerning difficulties with integration. A 
commission for Central American development has also been 
created to prepare work plans for the promotion of the region's 
economic growth. Additionally, a Legal Mutual Assistance Treaty 
is being signed by Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, 
and Panama to combat the criminal activities most common to the 
region.

  [Text] As for the statement made by President-elect Ernesto 
Perez Balladares regarding an amnesty that would put an end to 
political persecution, President Guillermo Endara announced this 
morning that he is preparing a pardon to benefit those who 
committed some type of political crime during the previous 
government. 
  Endara said he will ask the Cabinet Council on Wednesday for 
an 11-day leave to travel abroad starting on 10 June. During 
his absence Vice President Guillermo Ford will be in charge. 
The president also said he is preparing a pardon that would 
complement the amnesty law being discussed at the Legislative 
Assembly. 
  [Begin recording] [Endara] Since the elections, since before 
the elections I had planned to grant a pardon immediately after 
the elections. Great progress has been made on the pardon. The 
Legislative Assembly, however, has had the same idea, but the 
fact that I will grant a pardon does not mean the Legislative 
Assembly cannot grant its amnesty. They are separate measures. 
I will proceed with my studies of the pardon, and, perhaps 
before I take my leave, I will have the pardon ready. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Will the pardon benefit those who 
have committed different types of crimes? 
  [Endara] Only political-type crimes. I am fundamentally 
concentrating on the 510 corregimiento representatives, who made 
a political decision, a very dumb one by the way. It was a 
political-type decision, and they do not have to be politically 
persecuted for that political decision. I am talking about the 
case of the 510 corregimiento representatives who made that 
decision. I am also concentrating on the case of the Council of 
State, which elected Francisco Rodriguez president even though 
it did not have the authority to do so. It was strictly a 
political decision. I am fundamentally concentrating on those 
two cases. [end recording] 
  President Endara noted that the pardon will not benefit 
Colonel Eduardo Herrera, who is under arrest and is accused of 
plotting against the government. 
  [Begin Endara recording] As for the case of Mr. Eduardo 
Herrera, he committed serious mistakes against a budding 
democracy in its most critical moments. He was one of the 
persons who was called upon to protect democracy, but the first 
thing he did was to try to overthrow it. I am not going to 
include Mr. Herrera in my pardon. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] President Guillermo Endara yesterday expressed 
his agreement with the Supreme Court's opposition to the 
constitutional reforms that grant the Electoral Tribunal the 
power to interpret the Constitution on electoral issues. 
  Endara indicated that if the Electoral Tribunal members "do 
not make the corrections quickly, I believe the bill (with the 
constitutional reforms) is in danger of failing." 
  Endara's remarks come after the Supreme Court announced its 
opposition to the constitutional reforms that permit the 
Electoral Tribunal to interpret the Constitution on electoral 
issues. The Supreme Court considers the reforms "inadvisable" 
for the administration of justice. 
  "I know the court's opinion, and I personally agree with 
it," 
added Endara. [passage omitted] 
  The executive branch presented to the Legislative Assembly 
two constitutional reforms to grant autonomy to the Electoral 
Tribunal and to eliminate the possibility of an army existing in 
the country. 
  Nevertheless, according to Supreme Court President Arturo 
Hoyos, the justices unanimously agree that the first reform is 
inadvisable. 
  "In the way it has been proposed, this reform might be a 
source of constant conflict between the Electoral Tribunal and 
the Supreme Court of Justice," Hoyos added.

<F P=106> [From the "RPC Television News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] In the presence of top members of the boards of 
directors of the country's media, President Guillermo Endara 
Galimany signed the Chapultepec Declaration, a document that 
guarantees freedom of expression and freedom of the press in the 
democracies of the hemisphere. 
  The Palace of the Herons was the site for the signature of 
this important document, during a ceremony headed by President 
Guillermo Endara Galimany. 
  The Chapultepec Declaration is the product of an historic 
hemispheric conference held at the Chapultepec Castle in Mexico 
City on 11 March 1994. It includes 10 principles, which 
establish that freedom of expression is a right. It also points 
out that the media and journalists must not be the object of 
discrimination or favors because of what they may or may not say 
or write. The declaration points out that the credibility of 
the media is linked to its commitment to truth, the search for 
accuracy, impartiality, and fairness in the information being 
released. 
  [Begin recording] [LA PRENSA Director Roberto Eisenmann] It 
is said that freedom of expression is the mother of all 
freedoms. I want to tell you, colleagues, that the president of 
the Republic, is not signing this document for simple protocol. 
We can testify that he has personally studied the document. He 
has consulted us, he has thought it out very well because we 
know of his deep convictions regarding freedom of expression. 
  [EL PANAMA AMERICA Director Rosario Arias de Galindo] This 
document is especially important because of the events in our 
recent history. We hope to be able to understand it so as never 
to allow our freedom of expression to be taken away. [end 
recording] 
  President Guillermo Endara Galimany, when delivering his 
speech, said the ceremony was a protocol event because 
Panamanians enjoy freedom of expression and democracy. 
  [Begin Endara recording] I have respected freedom of 
expression. It has hurt me, I must confess it. The use of this 
freedom has hurt me, but the injury to government officials in 
general, not only myself, can never cause us to say that because 
it hurts us we will not allow the media to make use of its 
freedom of expression. A democratic president has the duty of 
defending this freedom no matter how much power he may have, 
including constitutional and legal powers. A democratic 
president must tolerate, as Panamanians say, he has to resist 
it. [end recording] 
  The president of the Republic noted that freedom of 
expression has to be defended at all costs and he said he was 
optimistic the new government will respect that right. 
  [Begin Endara recording] Despite certain doubts we may have 
had, I have the conviction that the new government will respect 
freedom of expression, but if it does not respect it -- and I do 
think it will respect it -- we all have the duty, including 
myself, to take to the streets to defend freedom of expression. 
[end recording] 
  At the conclusion of the ceremony, the participants agreed 
that the Declaration of Chapultepec, which places an emphasis on 
freedom of expression, is a key element for strengthening 
democracy.

<F P=106> [Report by Ciro Ortega from "The RPC Television News"] </F>
  [Text] The Legislative Assembly cannot be the guarantor of 
any agreement between the government and the International 
Financial Institutions [IFI], according to Legislative Assembly 
President Arturo Vallarino. 
  Vallarino pointed out that it is not the Legislative 
Assembly's fault that the IFI's are not making disbursements 
because of laws that have not been approved. The Legislative 
Assembly will not give urgent treatment to the bills that are 
necessary for reaching agreements between the national 
government and the IFI's. Arturo Vallarino emphatically said 
that the Legislative Assembly is never consulted about the 
alleged priorities. 
  [Begin recording] [Vallarino] If there is time, if the bills 
are considered necessary for the improvement of the 
administration of justice or for the social improvement of 
Panamanians, then we are going to approve them, but if we 
believe the bills do not have the importance or the priority for 
the country, then they will have to wait until the Legislative 
Assembly considers them, approves them, or rejects them. 
  [Ortega] Has the government failed to coordinate with the 
Legislative Assembly in view of such an important economic 
situation? 
  [Vallarino] We believe it is a flaw. That is why the 
Legislative Assembly approved a bill requiring that all 
commitments above $10 million be approved by the Legislative 
Assembly; the Executive has systematically been refusing to 
follow that procedure. The Legislative Assembly cannot be 
responsible for commitments made by the Executive simply because 
of the money it will receive. As long as the Executive refuses 
to allow the Legislative Assembly to intervene in the processing 
of the credits, we are going to find these types of conflicts. 
  [Ortega] Is there a solution to this problem on this 
occasion? 
  [Vallarino] The president has not yet approached us to try 
to 
convince us to pay special attention to the bills. He has 
simply said: Approve these bills because the disbursement of 
money depends on it. We believe that we are not going to reach 
an agreement within this system. [end recording] 
  Vallarino pointed out that it is never too late to correct 
flaws in coordination, especially in the political and economic 
arena.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 2 Jun (NA) -- Economy Minister Domingo 
Cavallo today said the Condor-2 missile project was drafted by 
"a gang of European mafia members who used our territory to 
develop technology that in fact was theirs." 
  Without mentioning names or nationalities of these alleged 
mafia members, the minister said President Carlos Menem decided 
to dismantle the project because he was certain the initiative 
"did not help Argentine interests." 
  Cavallo said this during a public hearing before Congress 
about the pharmaceuticals patents law. He compared the decision 
to dismantle the Condor-2 project to the efforts to ratify a law 
that recognizes the intellectual property of foreign 
laboratories. Cavallo said that both seek "to foster 
international trust in Argentina." 
  While delivering his lengthy speech about the official 
patents draft bill, the minister harshly clashed with Radical 
Civic Union Senator Conrado Storani who said the Condor-2 
Project was an example of the capacity of the Argentine 
scientists and technicians. 
  The economy minister bluntly rejected this opinion, saying 
the initiative was "really bad for our country." 
  He revealed that at the end of the Persian Gulf War, the 
U.S. 
forces found in Iraq a project similar to the Falda del Carmen 
facilities in Cordoba Province, where Condor was developed. 
  "The Condor project was not dismantled earlier because some 
Argentines asserted it would be giving in to U.S. pressure," 
Cavallo said. 
  Cavallo mentioned Brigadier Ernesto Crespo, retired, the 
former Air Force commander, as one who supported the theory of 
"not giving in to U.S. pressure."

  [Text] Although the National Commission for Atomic Energy 
(CNEA) admitted only yesterday that negotiations had been under 
way, the Canadian atomic energy company has affirmed that 
Argentina signed a "memorandum of understanding" for the 
installation of another nuclear reactor in the country. 
  Argentina's plans to acquire a new nuclear plant are 
expressed in a document signed with Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. 
(AECL), which will be in charge of conducting a feasibility 
study for installing a Candu-3 reactor, similar to the one 
installed at the Embalse nuclear plant in Cordoba. The new 
nuclear plant would cost about $600 million. 
  There are at least two curious things about this report. One 
is that AECL Chairman Bruce Howe himself admitted before the 
Canadian Congress that the economic viability of the kind of 
reactor Argentina is interested in buying is "doubtful". 
  The second is that in response to CLARIN, the CNEA press 
office admitted only yesterday that "negotiations have been 
under way, although nothing has been signed." This contradicts 
a report on the signing of the agreement, which was published in 
the 17 March issue of NUCLEONICS WEEK, the most prestigious 
publication on international nuclear industry matters. 
  Even more curious is the title of this article: "Despite the 
Unclear Economics of Candu-3, Argentina Will Try." The article 
states that "despite AECL's doubts about the economic viability 
of Candu-3, the company is trying to sell it abroad (...).'' It 
also announces the signing of a memorandum of understanding with 
CNEA to conduct a feasibility study to interconnect a 450 
megawatt reactor to the Argentine energy generator system. 
  According to biologist Raul Montenegro, chairman of the 
Foundation for the Defense of the Environment [Fundacion para la 
Defensa del Ambiente] (FUNAM), the idea of installing in 
Argentina a reactor that "the Canadians themselves believe is 
not economical shows that Argentina continues to be the test 
tube for developed countries." 
  Although CNEA has officially denied the signing of this 
agreement, an important CNEA researcher has confirmed the report 
to CLARIN. He asserted that "no reactor of this kind is yet 
operating in the entire world." This means that if this reactor 
is installed in Argentina, it will be the first ever, the same 
as happened with Atucha-1, which -- according to experts -- 
resulted in so many problems precisely because it was a 
prototype whose manufacture was later discontinued, and which 
had not been previously tested. 
  The report not only contradicts the international trend to 
reduce the use of nuclear energy in the production of 
electricity. It also seems to contradict the theory upheld by 
some government areas: In the last issue of ECONOMIC NEWS 
magazine -- issued by the Mediterranean Foundation, connected, 
naturally, to Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo -- Economist Juan 
Novara states that "contrary to what is publicized, nuclear 
energy is not clean, cheap, or price competitive." 
  The "fourth nuclear plant," is, however, not as 
contradictory 
within the framework of the program to privatize all nuclear 
plants. This idea is promoted by Cavallo himself, on the basis 
of the deficit in this area: Because about $900 million per 
year are invested in nuclear energy, and only $300 million 
obtained from energy sales, this deficit could be decreased by 
allowing private business to be in charge of selling electricity 
and the government in charge of its control. A country that 
offers four nuclear plants, instead of the two that are 
currently operating, would be more attractive. 
  Perhaps all these doubts (economic efficiency, 
privatization, 
which is still resisted within the CNEA, and naturally, the 
risks that nuclear energy entails) may have caused an apparently 
simple commercial transaction to become a state secret. 
  The memorandum signed between Argentina and Canada does not 
specify the work to be done, or where the future nuclear plant 
would be installed. This will be the fourth nuclear plant, if 
Atucha-2 is ever completed. It can be ascertained, however, 
that this information is being studied, as according to what 
AECL reported in March, the agreement estimates that "the first 
results will be provided by mid-year." 
  Half of the year has passed already, and CNEA has not even 
reported the existence of this memorandum of understanding. 
  Raul Montenegro, former Cordoba Province energy under 
secretary, has informed CLARIN, however, that "logical economics 
on the output of this type of reactor state that it would be 
viable only if it were situated next to the Embalse Rio Tercero 
nuclear plant." 
  This is not an outlandish idea if we consider that the site 
next to the Embalse Rio Tercero nuclear plant was preselected 
about eight years ago, when the idea of installing a fourth 
nuclear plant was still prevalent. 
  CNEA experts consulted by CLARIN agreed with this theory. 
They said: "There are very few sites in the country where this 
reactor would be economically viable. Embalse Rio Tercero is 
one of those."

  [Excerpt] [Cordoba Governor] Eduardo Angeloz began an 
obstacle race against the clock on 1 June. At the UCR [Radical 
Civic Union] executive committee offices on 1 June, he was 
installed as head of the brand new Political Action Committee. 
The committee is made up of 25 men who represent a variety of 
UCR internal factions. 
  Angeloz announced that "he is willing to accept" an 
electoral 
alliance for the 1995 presidential election based "on common 
principles" with other political parties that "share our concern 
over our country's social situation." Nevertheless, he said he 
would decide on his possible presidential candidacy after the 
UCR is reorganized. 
  The Political Action Committee will be responsible for 
presenting within 90 days an ambitious project aimed at turning 
the UCR "upside down" and totally reorganizing it in order to 
overcome the deep crisis prompted by various electoral defeats 
and the storm provoked by the Olivos Pact [between UCR President 
Raul Alfonsin and President Carlos Menem on constitutional 
reform]. 
  Yesterday was a key day for the Cordoba governor. His 
presidential candidacy largely depends on his success in this 
effort. At the UCR executive committee offices, Angeloz managed 
to gather the representatives of almost all UCR internal 
factions. San Isidro Mayor Melchor Posse smartly encouraged the 
cheerful participation of a large number of party members who 
constantly applauded and cheered Angeloz. 
  [Senator] Fernando de la Rua was the only one absent. He is 
convinced that the Political Action Committee, devised by 
Angeloz and approved by Alfonsin, conceals an agreement between 
Angeloz and Alfonsin since no deadline has been established for 
Alfonsin's early departure as UCR head. De la Rua refused to 
participate [in the committee]. In the eyes of other UCR 
people, he seems to be the only one hoping to become the 
anti-Alfonsin opposition leader. [passage omitted]

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  Bauza Pressures PJ Senators </H8>
  According to the 4 May Buenos Aires daily CLARIN, Secretary 
General of the Presidency Eduardo Bauza, at the request of 
President Carlos Menem, on 3 May met with Justicialist Party 
(PJ) senators to urge them to approve the draft Patents Law 
"whatever the cost." CLARIN explained that "if the law is 
approved, Clinton will invite Argentina to join NAFTA, and if 
the law is not approved, there will be harsh trade sanctions 
against Argentina after 30 June." 
  The daily noted that in spite of Senate President Eduardo 
Menem's promise that the Senate would approve the draft law by 
30 June--the deadline set by the United States for passage of 
the law before trade sanctions would be applied--there are no 
signs that both houses of Congress will pass the law by that 
time. The draft law must pass through five committees before it 
can be approved and sent to the lower chamber. Furthermore, 
"there is every indication that its movement through the Chamber 
of Deputies will be more difficult than through the Senate," 
CLARIN emphasized. 
The daily added that when U.S. Ambassador James Cheek stated 
he was confident the Argentine Congress would approve the law by 
the 60-day deadline, he "did not take into account" the 
opposition of the Radical Party (UCR) bloc in the Chamber of 
Deputies, which wants to discuss ratification of the GATT 
treaty, with its section on intellectual property rights, before 
discussing the Patent Law. CLARIN commented that the terms of 
the GATT agreement are more advantageous for Argentina than the 
draft Patent Law. 
<H8>  Granillo Ocampo on Possible Sanctions Delay </H8>
  On 9 May Argentine Ambassador to Washington Raul Granillo 
Ocampo said that the 60-day limit the United States had allowed 
Argentina for approval of the Patents Law before trade santions 
would go into effect "would probably be extended to six months," 
according to the 10 May Buenos Aires daily LA NACION. After that 
time, the ambassador predicted, the U.S. Government would impose 
trade sanctions if intellectual property rights do not receive 
adequate protection in Argentina. Granillo Ocampo confirmed the 
Argentine Government's "commitment" to approve a "new patents 
law which would recognize the intellectual property rights of 
[pharmaceutical] laboratories."

  [Text] Armed Forces Commander General Fernando Sanjines 
warned yesterday that foreign interests want to meddle in the 
country's internal affairs, and demanded that solutions to the 
many national problems must come from the Bolivian people. 
  He said it would be dangerous if anarchy descended on the 
country, as this would go against the country's need for 
development. Gen. Sanjines also reiterated his support for the 
state of law. 
  He added: "From the prudent viewpoint of not discussing 
political issues and putting ourselves within a realistic 
framework, we believe that the solution to our problems should 
be entrusted to capable Bolivian statesmen, as accepting foreign 
influence would lead to greater complications." 
  These comments were made during the 165th anniversary of the 
Armed Forces General Staff, a celebration headed by President 
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, commander in chief of the Armed 
Forces. 
  Gen. Sanjines recalled that since the birth of Bolivia as an 
independent republic, threats of the division of society and 
interference by foreign interests have caused irreparable damage 
throughout its history. 
  He said that this concern has allowed the armed institutions 
to become the country's moral reserve and national identity in 
the face of possible threats to the legally established 
government, and to become the indissoluble part of the dearest 
aspirations of the Bolivian people for progress and development. 
  Sanjines said: "We have improved our criteria in these 12 
years for preserving legality, our sole concern being to 
diminish dependency. And this is an objective mainly based on 
political stability, which is the basis for economic potential 
and social justice, which in turn are the result of productivity 
and efficiency." 
  He also demanded the careful reorganization of the Armed 
Forces on the basis of the country's real requirements, and not 
on the basis of personal or subordinated criteria. 
  He also called for: "The conciliation of human and material 
requirements that would ensure the better fulfillment of our 
mission of protecting sovereignty and territorial integrity." 
  He also called for understanding among the different social 
sectors to overcome the problems of the country through dialogue 
and agreement. 
  He also rejected what he called "the latent threat of 
anarchy 
and its terrible outcome of instability, which could scare away 
investments and slow the enthusiasm for new efforts to make 
economic growth possible, which is the basis for creating more 
jobs."

  [Text] Cochabamba, Bolivia 1 Jun (EFE) -- The preparatory 
meeting for the "International Decade of the World's Indigeous 
People" closed today in Cochabamba, Bolivia, with the approval 
of a document to be submitted to the United Nations. 
  The document contains 53 resolutions vindicating the 
cultural 
identity of indigenous peoples, along with their political, 
social and economic rights. 
  Guatemalan Nobel Peace Laureate Rigoberta Menchu presided 
over the meeting which started on 31 May. She stated today that 
indigenous peoples hope their demands will be formally 
recognized by all UN member-countries. 
  Menchu said the resolutions approved in Cochabamba will 
become mandatory for all countries worldwide once they are 
approved by the UN General Assembly. 
  Commenting on what transpired during the meeting in 
Cochabamba, some 400 km east of La Paz, Bolivian Vice President 
Victor Hugo Cardenas -- himself an Aymara Indian -- said: 
"Indigenous peoples can achieve development without renouncing 
their own culture." 
  The "International Decade of the World's Indigenous People" 
starts on 10 December 1994 and closes on 9 December 2004. 
  Beside Menchu and Cardenas, 120 delegates from diverse 
indigenous communities and government organizations from 
different countries attended the meeting in Cochabamba.

  [Text] The Brazilian Government has adopted a cautious 
stance concerning the news that the ousted president of Haiti, 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, has apparently endorsed armed 
intervention in his country. 
  This would be Aristide's solution for reinstatement as 
president, from which post he was unseated in 1991 by a military 
junta. The news was released today by an international news 
agency. Foreign Minister Celso Amorim stated that the Brazilian 
Government feels that the use of force would be an extreme 
measure. Amorim believes this is a complex question, and one 
first has to see whether the sanctions applied by the United 
Nations against the Haitian military yield positive results. He 
said: 
  [Begin Amorim recording] For the time being, the United 
Nations, the UN Security Council -- the appropriate body to 
apply coercive measures -- has renewed and stepped up sanctions 
against the de facto Haitian Government. I think we have to 
verify whether these more stringent sanctions are working. 
Moreover, an armed intervention is a most complex question. It 
is difficult... [pauses] We acknowledge the legitimate objective 
of having President Aristide reinstated in office, and we have 
supported this, but the use of force is something that always 
inspires caution and needs to be examined with great care. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Brasilia, 5 Jun (AFP) -- The Brazilian Government 
will send an Army infantry company to assist the UN peacekeeping 
mission in Mozambique, the Brazilian Foreign Ministry, based at 
the Itamaraty Palace, officially announced on Sunday. 
  The Brazilian decision to send infantry troops was in 
response to a request made by the United Nations. Brazil 
currently has 94 observers, 27 soldiers, and 67 policemen posted 
in Mozambique. 
  Likewise, the Foreign Ministry informed that Walter Costa 
Porto, constitutional law professor at the University of 
Brasilia, was appointed member of the Mozambican Electoral 
Tribunal, which will supervise the elections scheduled for 
October. 
  The Itamaraty communique stated that "this participation 
reveals the Brazilian commitment to UN operations for the 
preservation of peace and its commitment to the efforts to 
promote national reconciliation in Mozambique."

  [Excerpt] Brasilia -- Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero said 
yesterday that as of 1 July -- when the real will replace the 
real cruzeiro as legal tender -- and for an unspecified time, 
one real will be worth one dollar. 
  The issuance of the real will be backed by part of the 
Brazilian exchange reserves, which currently stand at $38 
billion, considering the concept of international liquidity 
(which includes both available and applied resources). 
  The opening of checking accounts in dollars will not be 
permitted and the current rules governing the exchange of 
foreign currency will be maintained. Thus, there will be no 
free convertibility of the real. 
  Ricupero stated that the real will be backed only by 
exchange 
reserves, consisting of foreign currency and gold. Stocks of 
state-owned companies will not be used to back the issuance of 
the real. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Brasilia -- The PT [Workers Party] yesterday asked 
the Federal Supreme Court [STF] to declare the electoral law 
that forbids parties and candidates from receiving donations 
from labor unions as unconstitutional. The PT wants the STF to 
declare the law unconstitutional, alleging that it contradicts 
the principle of equality because it does not forbid companies 
from contributing to the campaigns of parties or candidates of 
their liking. 
  The petition pertains to Paragraph 6, Article 45 of Law No. 
8713/93. The PT's decision to question the mentioned law follows 
an incident a week ago involving PT presidential candidate Luiz 
Inacio Lula da Silva, against whom charges have been filed for 
having campaigned outside factories in Sao Bernard do Campo 
using the public address truck of the metal workers union of the 
Sao Paulo ABC industrial region. 
  The PT does not like the fact that it can speak to a group 
of 
businessmen in the auditorium of the Sao Paulo State Federation 
of Industries (FIESP) but cannot address a group of workers 
using their labor union public address truck.

  [Text] PT [Workers Party] presidential candidate Luiz 
Inacio Lula da Silva yesterday denied any links between his 
party and the Landless People's Movement (MST). "I don't 
believe in that," Lula said while on a Brasilia-Sao Paulo 
flight, on his way back from a Citizens' Caravan tour of 
Brasilia satellite towns. "I have no information on the PT 
being engaged in organizing the movement." 
  "People have no land because they have no government," he 
said. Lula emphasized he knows people in the landless movement, 
and knows they like to be independent. "They are even 
sectarian," he noted, adding he does not believe they would 
tolerate anyone's leadership. 
  Sole Workers Center (CUT) President Vicente Paulo da Silva, 
aka Vicentinho, yesterday labelled "terrorist" a Strategic 
Affairs Secretariat (SAE) report on the MST. "To me it's an 
anti-Lula report," he said. "I do not believe a bit of what it 
says, and I will go to the places where the intelligence service 
has spotted guerrilla bases to prove that this is not true," he 
added. 
<H5>  Solidarity </H5>
  According to Vicentinho, the MST and the CUT are "on good 
terms." "We feel solidarity for the movement, but the MST is an 
independent organization," he added. "The Metalworkers' Union 
of the Sao Paulo industrial belt has already helped the MST 
camps by sending them food, but the communities of the areas 
near the occupied zones have also provided them food and 
medicines." 
  Vicentinho believes the MST has no armed structure. "I 
believe they are even pacifist," he said, "because they are just 
fighting for a piece of land and for the right to live." 
Vicentinho also denied charges of MST radicalism. "Saying that 
the MST is a leftist movement is very different from saying what 
the SAE report said." 
<H5>  Doubts </H5>
  Acting National Confederation of Farmworkers (Contag) 
President Aloisio Carneiro also cast doubts on the report. "The 
MST is an independent organization and has nothing to do with 
Contag," he said, adding that "all the same I do not believe in 
the SAE report." Carneiro said that MST and Contag are also on 
good terms. "Like the MST, our congresses chose occupation as a 
method for action," he said. "It is a form of pressuring the 
government to implement land reform."

<F P=106> [Interview with Jose Luis Sobrinho, former leader of the </F>
Sole Workers Central, CUT, and Landless People's Movement, MST, 
by Angela Lacerda; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Lacerda] What can you tell us about the report on 
the existence of a guerrilla training center at the Workers 
Ranch? 
  [Sobrinho] I do not know. It could be a rumor, spread by 
people with interests in the area or by ill-informed 
individuals. What we cannot deny is that the MST is starting to 
have a war image, which is not real and which does not help the 
struggle for agrarian reform. They make a lot of noise and 
obtain poor results. It is a case of "too much potato and too 
little meat." 
  [Lacerda] Do you think the MST is the appropriate channel 
for 
achieving agrarian reform? 
  [Sobrinho] No. The MST is one of the instruments. What I 
criticize in this movement, and what I try to tell our fellow 
peasants, is that the agrarian reform is not the responsibility 
of a single entity. I do not question MST's good intentions, 
but the movement has adopted policies characterized by 
imposition, bureaucracy, and state ownership. If we are not 
careful, the MST will end up as a paternalistic movement, 
considering itself to be the sole representative of agrarian 
reform. We have already seen conflicts in expropriated areas on 
the issue of land ownership. Does the land belong to workers or 
to the MST? I am not supporting capitalism as a solution, but 
it is necessary to find a middle ground. 
  [Lacerda] But the MST has helped landless people, has it 
not? 
  [Sobrinho] Sometimes they act in radical ways and end up 
losing the people's support for causes that are absolutely just. 
Landless peasants often invade unproductive areas or land owned 
by people who are indebted to the state. 
  [Lacerda] What else do you condemn in the MST? 
  [Sobrinho] First I want to make clear that I believe the MST 
is doing an important job. But I am worried about the 
movements' narrow views. Agrarian reform does not mean simply 
conquering the land. Our experience shows that most people who 
have benefited from a piece of land abandon their lots if they 
have the tools to work them. This occurs because landless 
peasants are led to believe that all their problems will end 
when they settle on a new piece of land. Things are quite 
different in real life. 
  [Lacerda] What do you think is needed, then? 
  [Sobrinho] Peasants occupying a piece of land need to eat 
until their land starts producing. They need medical care. 
They need to learn how to read, and credit to start 
cultivating. I think they need a comprehensive program with the 
support of many entities and groups until they can stand on 
their own two legs. 
  [Lacerda] Are landless peasants prepared to produce? 
  [Sobrinho] Most of them are not. It is not their fault that 
they lack preparation. People from the northeastern forest 
zones, for instance, became used to factory salaries. Workers' 
unions are not doing anything to prepare these people to become 
farmers. 
  [Lacerda] Do you believe an agrarian reform encompassing all 
those aspects is viable? 
  [Sobrinho] Yes. It is arduous, but a true agrarian reform 
will require a lot of work. Those who think that an agrarian 
reform can be implemented only through the installation of a 
socialist state are completely wrong. Besides, the right as 
well as the left agree on the need for change in land ownership 
policies. I think there is lack of government political 
willingness, on one hand, as well as lack of planning and 
reasoning by those organizing and struggling with workers and 
landless peasants.

  [Text] In an interview granted yesterday to O ESTADO by 
fax, Joao Pedro Stedile -- one of the most important members of 
the National Coordinating Board of the Landless People's 
Movement, MST -- said that the target of the SAE [Strategic 
Affairs Secretariat] report is not the movement. "People are 
afraid of Lula's candidacy," he said. Here are some of 
Stedile's answers: 
  [O ESTADO] How does the MST evaluate the SAE report? 
  [Stedile] It is a shame. It is an action typical of retired 
military spies [araponga]. It must have been a vice acquired 
during the days of the military dictatorship. In the last few 
months, the MST National Coordinating Board met the president of 
the Republic. The president promised to begin a program to 
settle 100,000 families. The labor minister visited our 
encampment. Minister Mario Flores (of the SAE) does not need to 
pay the retired military to watch us. We invite them to visit. 
We will show them all of our very Brazilian weapons, such as 
hunger, unproductive farms, children without schools, and a 
great desire to work. 
  [O ESTADO] What is the MST's ideological trend? 
  [Stedile] The MST was born from the workers' need to ensure 
the implementation of the agrarian reform. The Constitution 
establishes that all unproductive land must be expropriated. No 
ideological motivation is required. 
  [O ESTADO] What about guerrilla training at Ipojuca, which 
was mentioned in the SAE report, and the objectives of the armed 
fight at Bico do Papagaio [a region in the northern part of 
Tocantins State]? 
  [Stedile] This is nonsense. The Ipojuca settlement was 
established by the Liberal Front Party government. In Tocantins 
State, the MST does not even exist. 
  [O ESTADO] Does the MST have members from other countries? 
  [Stedile] That is another myth. The SNI [National 
Intelligence Service] (the organization that preceded the SAE) 
should know about international politics. With all the misery 
reigning in the country, we do not need foreigners to explain 
our reality to us. 
  [O ESTADO] What relation does the movement have with similar 
groups in South America, such as the Paraguayan MST? 
  [Stedile] Latin America has the Peasant and Indigenous 
Popular Movement of the 500 Years of Resistance. The MST, CUT 
[Sole Workers Center], indigenous groups, and black groups 
participate in this movement on Brazil's behalf. 
  [O ESTADO] What is role of CUT and the PT [Workers Party] in 
the movement? 
  [Stedile] We identify ourselves with CUT, and some MST 
militants and leaders are affiliated to the PT. People, 
however, support all parties. Some deputies, such as Mauro 
Bragato of the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], are 
Sao Paulo Governor Fleury's leaders in the Assembly. 
  [O ESTADO] And the MST resources? 
  [Stedile] They basically come from our own grassroots. It is 
an illusion to think that our resources come from abroad. In 
many cases we receive support from the Church, and most of our 
encampments receive food from the government.

  [Excerpt] As a result of two operations, one in Santiago 
and another in Concepcion, Dipolcar [Carabineros Intelligence 
Directorate] agents dismantled a Mapu Lautaro cell and arrested 
two men and one woman allegedly involved in terrorist actions. 
  The arrested people were identified as Daniel Andrade 
Sanchez, 26; Jorge Ruminot Sagredo, 24; and Ruth Tobar Montoya, 
22, mother of a boy named Ruben who was born early this month. 
  The woman was arrested with Ruminot Sagredo during a dawn 
raid yesterday on a house at 1521-B Reumen Street near Pedro 
Fontova Street in the Conchali district. 
  According to Dipolcar agents, the cell had Mapu Lautaro 
literature and propaganda as well as plans of barracks and 
public service offices. [passage omitted]

was asserted today by Economy Minister Alvaro Garcia who, on 1 
June, returned from a tour of Asian countries, including 
Malaysia and China. 
  During his stay in the PRC, Garcia met with Chinese 
businessmen and officials who authorized the importation of 
Chilean apples and kiwi fruit. They also agreed to study the 
possible import of Chilean grapes and pears. 
  Garcia added that Sino-Chilean business meetings will be 
held 
with the objective of increasing bilateral trade and the 
undertaking of joint ventures. He also stressed that the PRC, 
which has 1.2 billion inhabitants, is very important for Chilean 
exports, adding that China has become an increasingly attractive 
market in view of its strong economic growth over the past three 
years.

  [Excerpt] Admiral Jorge Martinez Busch, Navy commander in 
chief, told LA TERCERA that Chile's effective occupation of its 
ocean territory can be accomplished only by increasing the 
merchant fleet capacity and fishing activities, scientific 
research, ocean sports, and the development of maritime culture, 
not only through art but also with photography, poetry, and 
novels. 
  These comments by the high-ranking Navy officer were in 
reaction to President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle's proposal to 
create, in six months, a National Oceanic Commission to seek the 
effective occupation of the seas. 
  Following his policy of refraining from public comment on 
issues raised by the highest political authorities of the 
country, Martinez Busch said, however, that when the commission 
is installed "our institution will be ready to provide all the 
necessary technical data to achieve the objectives proposed by 
the president." [passage omitted]

  [Text] By 10 votes to three, the Supreme Court today ruled 
that the Amnesty Law is not applicable in the murder of former 
Foreign Minister Orlando Letelier. 
  The Supreme Court justices thus rejected a request filed by 
the attorneys of [General Manuel Contreras and Brigadier Pedro 
Espinoza], the former chiefs of Dina [National Intelligence 
Directorate], who claimed it was unconstitutional not to apply 
the 1978 Amnesty Law to Orlando Letelier's murder in 1976. 
  The ruling stipulates that the attack perpetrated in 
Washington will not be granted this benefit. Moreover, the 
Supreme Court enumerates several other elements in which it 
reiterates that in not applying the Amnesty Law to this lawsuit 
it is by no means acting arbitrarily. 
  [Begin prosecuting lawyer Juan Bustos recording] The 
fundamental thing within a rule of law is precisely to go after 
and condemn those who commit crimes. The contrary would be 
something exceptional, something which in general should not 
occur within a rule of law. [end recording] 
  The defense attorneys for Contreras and Espinoza still have 
another appeal pending. In addition, they appealed the judgment 
by Judge Rodolfo Banados, who sentenced the former Dina chiefs 
to seven and six years' imprisonment respectively.

<F P=106> [Article by Emilio Lomas] </F>
  [Text] Cuautlancingo, Puebla, 2 Jun -- President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari has said that the North American Free Trade 
Agreement has clearly established the so-called "place-of-origin 
regulations," and, as a result, Mexico has not become a 
springboard for the reexport of goods produced by other nations. 
  At the inauguration of the El Vocho Industrial Park in San 
Lorenzo Almecatla, the chief executive added that this agreement 
will considerably decrease the outflow of workers from Mexico to 
the United States and Canada. Workers will no longer have to 
migrate to places that offer employment, because new 
opportunities are opening up in the country, Salinas said. 
  On the second day of a tour focusing on the electricity 
issue, the president added that foreign investment in this 
industrial zone during the first four months of 1994 was higher 
than in 1992 and 1993: "This means more jobs and greater 
possibilities of competing in the industrial area in other 
markets." 
  He inaugurated the San Lazaro Almecatla Power Substation and 
symbolically inaugurated five other substations and five 
transmission lines. The president of the Republic said that in 
the past six years the electric sector increased its production 
capacity by more than 35 percent. 
  In the company of Emilio Lozoya Thalmann, secretary of 
energy, mines, and parastatal industry; Carlos Rojas, secretary 
of social development; and Guillermo Guerrero Villalobos, 
director of the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE), Salinas 
added that during his administration 21 million new Mexicans 
have received electric services and that 10 rural communities 
are being incorporated into the system each day. He said that 
without sufficient electric energy the country would not have 
been able to establish such bases for additional economic growth 
"as the ones that we can now expect to have in Mexico." 
  Eduardo Arreola Valdes, CFE deputy director for programming, 
said that 5,763 km of high-tension transmission lines have been 
put into service and that 53 power substation have been built 
during the 1989-1994 period. This, he added, represents 
increases of 20.7 and 25.9 percent, respectively, compared to 
the facilities that existed at the start of this six-year term. 
  President Salinas also inaugurated the President Plutarco 
Elias Calles thermoelectric plant in La Union, Guerrero State. 
There he said that 95 percent of Mexicans have electric energy. 
He pointed out that this thermoelectric plant is the largest of 
its kind in Latin America. 
  He said that 7.5 billion new pesos were invested in this 
plant, which will use fuel or coal, depending on the best 
operational conditions. Salinas added that once the 
construction of this plant, which was started during this 
six-year term, is concluded, it will contribute to the national 
electric system more than 10 percent of the country's total 
capacity. 
  Secretary Emilio Lozoya Thalmann said during this ceremony 
that production capacity increased by 8,306 megawatts during the 
1989-1994 period, from 23,554 to 31,860 megawatts, that is, a 35 
percent increase. In addition, works that were started during 
this period will add 3,766 megawatts and will be operational 
between 1995 and 1997. 
  Lozoya added that recent estimates indicate that about 8,000 
megawatts need to be added to the current electric production 
generation capacity within the next 11 years. This, he said, 
requires significant financing that calls for private 
involvement in the production of electric energy without 
implying that the state will abandon its constitutional 
responsibility for providing this public service.

<F P=106> [Report by Robert Gonzalez Amador] </F>
  [Text] Hermino Blanco Mendoza, under secretary for 
international trade relations at the Commerce and Industrial 
Development Secretariat (Secofi), acknowledged yesterday that 
Mexico's productive sector has expressed its opposition to 
attempts to lower tariffs in advance on 155 goods included in 
the Free Trade Pact (TLC). 
  The official stated that, following discussions between 
Secofi authorities and Mexican manufacturers, "very few articles 
will undergo tariff exemptions adjustments, since the position 
adopted by Mexican manufacturers and farmers is not to negotiate 
with respect to this aspect." 
  Yesterday, Herminio Blanco participated in hearings by the 
Senate's Trade and Industrial Development and Foreign Relations 
Commissions in which he provided an explanation with respect to 
the status of the free trade agreement between Mexico and Costa 
Rica. 
  Departing from the hearing's agenda, Angel Sergio Guerrero, 
Durango State PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] senator, 
said that lowering duties in advance on 155 items included in 
the TLC -- announced in the 22 May Official Gazette -- "would be 
similar to substantially modifying the North American Free Trade 
Agreement [NAFTA], which is of concern since adjustments have 
been suggested by one of the parties to the agreement." The 
senator asked: What's the reason for this attempt to propose 
tariff exemptions in advance? 
  The Secofi official explained to the PRI senator that "there 
should be no apprehensions because the treaty allows lowering 
tariffs in advance if requested by one of the parties and if the 
other two are in agreement." 
  Blanco added that Secofi had analyzed the issue ever since 
the announcement was published in the Official Gazette. He also 
indicated that Secofi is expected to conclude discussions on the 
issue by 23 June. However, Blanco pointed out that the position 
adopted by the country's productive sector is not to negotiate 
lowering tariffs in advance. 
  Under Secretary Blanco stated that of the 155 items on which 
tax exemptions had been proposed "per Mexico's request," 107 
were proposed by Mexico, 43 by the United States, and seven by 
Canada. These items represent a "relatively low bilateral trade 
flow," which represents 3.8 percent of Mexico's exports to the 
United States and 2.8 percent of U.S. sales to Mexico. 
  The U.S. counterpart, Blanco added, requested tariff 
exemptions for items such as potatoes, beans, cheese, and wine. 
However, Mexican growers pointed out that exemptions in advance 
are unthinkable in these cases. Hermino Blanco explained to the 
senators that the final outcome of this process will be that 
"very few items will receive tariff exemptions before the dates 
established by the free trade agreement." 
  In a meeting with federal representatives, Hector Teran, a 
PAN [National Action Party] member and Baja California senator, 
indicated that along the northern border "there are problems 
realizing the benefits of the free trade agreement." He also 
voiced his doubts with respect to the ever-growing trade 
deficit's being profitable to the country, saying that, on the 
contrary, the imbalance in the exchange of goods could undermine 
the currency's parity during the next few months. 
  In reply, Blanco pointed out that the trade deficit, which 
totaled $4.317 billion during the first quarter, is natural and 
indicated that Mexico is a country that imports capital goods 
and raw materials essential to its development. He added that 
this past April, for the first time, monthly exports to the 
United States surpassed $4 billion. He also proposed that 
Secofi exercise more vigilance in order to expedite export 
transactions, although he insisted that, regarding deregulation, 
"many things have changed favorably." 
  During the hearing, which was presided over by Hidalgo 
Senator Humberto Lugo Gil, PRI bloc coordinator in the Chamber 
of Senators, 10 legislators intervened to request more 
information with respect to the free trade agreement between 
Mexico and Costa Rica signed this past 5 April by both nations' 
presidents. 
  In his presentation before the question and answer period, 
Herminio Blanco Mendoza pointed out that, as a result of the 
agreed upon trade liberalization program, Mexico will be able to 
export, starting on the day the treaty comes into force, all 
goods that Costa Rica does not produce. Thus, 70 percent of 
nonagricultural Mexican sales to that nation and 75 percent of 
Costa Rican exports to Mexico will be tariff-free. 
  In reply to a question by Morelos Senator Angel Ventura 
Valle, the Secofi official said that agricultural exports from 
Costa Rica to Mexico will not harm national production. Costa 
Rican coffee and plantains were excluded from the agreement, and 
the elimination of tariffs on Costa Rican corn and beans will be 
implemented in 15 years, he added. 
  Sinaoloa Senator Gustavo Guerrero said that produce growers 
in his state worry about the possibility of illegal 
transshipment of tomatoes, potatoes, lettuce, and other produce 
from the United States to Mexico. Blanco Mendoza said that the 
rules on the origin of products specified in the agreement are 
clear. He added that Mexican authorities, in coordination with 
national producers, will ensure that this type of illegal 
practices do not occur. 
  Herminio Blanco Mendoza said that the trade agreements 
reached on the American Continent in past years constitute a 
firm step toward the establishment of genuine regional trade 
integration. "After decades of speeches there is finally 
progress," he added.

<F P=106> [Report by Leticia Rodriguez Lopez] </F>
  [Text] The Mexican Government rejects the proliferation of 
bilateral trade agreements because they would cause "excessive 
confusion" with merchandise-origin rules and risk trade 
triangularization, which in the end would threaten free trade in 
Latin America. 
  Jaime Serra Puche, head of the Commerce and Industrial 
Development Secretariat [Secofi], guaranteed before 
representatives of 27 Latin American and Caribbean countries, as 
well as representatives of international organizations, that the 
North American Free Trade Agreement [NAFTA] "has not weakened 
and has instead strengthened our ties with other countries and 
areas." 
  When inaugurating yesterday the 20th Latin American Council 
meeting of SELA [Latin American Economic System] at the 
ministerial level, Serra Puche confirmed Mexico's commitment to 
Latin America and its position that the trilateral trade treaty 
with North America is open for regional countries to join. 
  The Secofi secretary said in an interview that the new World 
Trade Organization (OMC), which will replace GATT [General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade], should draft clear and open 
rules, as well as demand that they be complied with to avoid 
unfair practices and trade wars. 
  He stressed that, with the proliferation of bilateral 
agreements in Latin America, there would be different 
merchandise-origin rules, which would induce the 
triangularization of products and, in turn, hinder area free 
trade. 
  In this connection, he reiterated that Mexico's position is 
that, with the expansion of NAFTA, clear rules must be defined 
so that new members or a group of countries may join, "instead 
of having a proliferation of bilateral relations or regional 
agreements." Even though Mexico has established bilateral 
agreements, all are compatible with NAFTA, because they serve 
the same areas and have rules of origin that are very alike, 
which avoid any triangularization problems, he said. 
  Serra Puche explained that, excepting Chile, the agreements 
that have been negotiated in the area include goods, services, 
and investments. The same criteria has been set to determine 
the rules of origin, fight unfair trade practices, and 
standardize, regulate, and respect intellectual property, among 
other topics. 
  During SELA's inauguration activities, which end today at 
the 
Mexican Foreign Relations Secretariat, the Secofi secretary 
stressed that the liberalization of trade between countries with 
economic links, with stable rules, allows safe access to markets 
and long- term project planning. 
  Likewise he said that the liberalization of trade allows 
countries to use more efficient operating scales, take advantage 
of market niches, and access a broad range of technological 
options -- all of which favor productive flexibility. 
  In general, it offers clearer market signals, which ease 
efficient economic decisionmaking, and increases in the general 
level of competitiveness among the countries that participate in 
the free trade agreements. 
  After stating that, following two years of treaty operations 
between Mexico and Chile, trade has increased 86 percent, he 
recalled that on 13 June President Salinas will sign in Colombia 
a free trade agreement with the Group of Three (Mexico, 
Colombia, and Venezuela). Serra Puche also spoke of the 
solidarity efforts that Latin American countries must make to 
attend to the needs of the more-impoverished population and 
achieve healthy and sustained growth.

  [Text] Mexico City, 2 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Jaime Serra Puche, 
Commerce and Industrial Development Secretary, reiterated today 
his country's stance favoring other nations' joining the North 
American Free Trade Agreement under the condition that this be 
done with clear place-of-origin regulations. 
  Mexico supports the expansion of the treaty as long as 
confusion about the place of origin is avoided, the official 
stated while inaugurating the two-day ministerial meeting of the 
Latin American Economic System (SELA). In his inaugural speech, 
Serra Puche recalled that the text of the treaty that entered 
into force on 1 January includes Article 2204 that considers the 
possibility that another country or group of countries may join 
the North American commercial zone. 
  Serra Puche explained that with the proliferation of 
bilateral agreements there will be different regulations on the 
place of origin, which may cause a triangulation and hamper 
regional commerce. He stressed that commercial liberalism among 
the countries that become joined with clear and stable rules 
yields the benefits of assured access to markets and the design 
of long-term projects in companies. 
  It also allows, he said, a broad and varied demand and the 
use of more efficient scales of cooperation and of a broad range 
of technological options that favor productive flexibility. 
"The increase in competitiveness stimulates investments, 
promotes an increase in exports, and creates productive and 
remunerated jobs, something that entails economic growth," the 
secretary indicated. 
  Mexico is not on the sidelines of these processes, and in 
1990 President Carlos Salinas de Gortari voiced his concern 
about insufficiencies regarding integration and proposed 
specific measures to expand the Latin American market, he added. 
  The commerce and industrial development secretary noted that 
the establishment of multinational economic openings responds to 
the demands of the world economy and the permanent search to 
raise the competitiveness of the countries of the region. As 
proof of that, he said, we have the negotiations that have been 
started with several area countries, which led to a free trade 
agreement with Chile. 
  The official announced that, within the framework of the 
Ibero-American Summit to be held in Cartagena de Indias, 
President Salinas de Gortari will sign on 13 June the G-3 [Group 
of Three] trade agreement with his Colombian and Venezuelan 
counterpart. 
  Trade negotiations with the Central American countries are 
continuing, and the negotiations with Bolivia may conclude in 
the coming weeks, he added. On the trade agreement with Chile, 
Serra Puche commented that, according to a joint evaluation 
commission, there has been a two-way flow of exchange amounting 
to 86 percent since the treaty entered into force in 1992. 
  During the ministerial meeting taking place at the Foreign 
Secretariat with representatives from 27 countries, Serra Puche 
pointed to the role SELA plays as the appropriate forum to 
reflect on the challenges that Latin American integration 
entails.

<F P=106> [Text of "Agreement" published in DIARIO OFICIAL DE LA </F>
FEDERACION on 31 May] 
  [Text] The Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial 
Development, Secofi, presents the agreement establishing the 
rules for the determination of the country of origin of imported 
merchandise and the conditions [provisiones] for its 
certification with regard to compensatory quotas. Article No. 3 
of annex I of the Rules of Origin explains that the definition 
of the place of origin of goods will be made in accordance with 
the following: 
  1. The country of origin of a good will be the one where one 
of the following holds true: 
  a) that the goods be fully obtained [obtenido] or produced 
there; 
  b) that the goods be exclusively produced from national 
materials; or 
  c) that each foreign material incorporated in the goods 
comply with the applicable change in tariff classification 
established by the Appendix on Specific Rules of this agreement, 
that it meet other applicable requisites of this appendix, and 
that it also meet all other applicable requisites of this 
agreement. 
  2. When the country of origin cannot be determined through 
the provisions specified in paragraph No. 1 [fraccion], the 
country of origin of a good will be the country or countries of 
origin of the material or materials that give basic shape 
[caracter esencial] to that good. The provisions of this 
paragraph will not be applicable to a good specifically 
described as a set or a whole [conjunto] in keeping with the 
nomenclature of the Tariff of the Law on General Import Tax or 
to a good whose tariff classification is that of a set, or a 
whole, or a compound good, in keeping with general rule No. 3, 
contained in article No. 2 of the aforementioned law. 
  3. When the country of origin cannot be determined through 
the provisions of paragraphs Nos. 1 and 2 of this article, or a 
good is described specifically as a set or whole by the 
nomenclature of the Tariff of the Law on General Import Tax, or 
a good whose tariff classification is that of a set or whole or 
a compound good, according to general rule No. 3 of article 2 of 
the aforementioned law, the country or countries of origin of 
that good will be the country or countries of all materials that 
make it up. The provisions of this paragraph will prevail over 
the provisions of the Appendix on Specific Rules of this 
agreement. 
  4. When there is no specific rule on the country of origin 
for goods in the Appendix on Specific Rules for this agreement, 
and without detriment to the provisions contained in 
subparagraphs A and B of paragraph No. 1 of this article and 
without detriment to paragraphs Nos. 2 and 3 of this article, 
the country of origin of that good will be the one where the 
last significant transformation that merits a tariff 
reclassification occurred.

  [Text] Brussels, 3 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The European Union 
[EU] today denied reports that it is going to sign a free trade 
agreement with Mexico which, according to an EU spokesman, would 
be viewed as "discriminatory" by other Latin American states. 
  The spokesman, as well as Mexican diplomatic sources, has 
dismissed the possibility of including a special clause 
pertaining to Mexico in the final document on Latin America, 
which will be signed by the European foreign ministers at their 
summit in Corfu. "It is unrealistic to believe that relations 
with Latin America will focus on Mexico, because that could 
create political problems with other states in the region," said 
a spokesman for Manuel Marin, commissioner for EU development. 
  According to this source, there is "disagreement" within the 
EU regarding Mexico's status within the context of relations 
with Latin America, because of the North American Free Trade 
Agreement that the country signed with the United States and 
Canada. 
  Mexican diplomats have denied the existence of official 
documents that substantiate the alleged negotiation of a free 
trade agreement between the two countries, as the Spanish 
newspaper "EL PAIS" reported in its Friday edition. 
  Nevertheless, the newspaper explained that within the EU 
there are "groups" that have a specific political interest in 
Mexico, but countries such as Spain and Portugal are opposed 
because they fear a souring of relations with the rest of the 
region. "It is very unlikely that Spain will support the 
decision to give Mexico special treatment, because that would 
prompt other Latin American countries to request similar 
treatment," the spokesman told NOTIMEX. 
  Portugal, meanwhile, has said that it will request a special 
agreement with Brazil if the European Commission decides to sign 
a treaty of association with Mexico. According to EL PAIS, the 
EU is planning to make qualitative changes in its relations with 
Mexico during the summit of heads of government and foreign 
ministers scheduled for 24 and 25 June on the Greek island of 
Corfu. The newspaper asserts that plans are taking shape to 
negotiate an industrial free trade agreement similar to the one 
the EU is currently discussing with Morocco.

  [Text] Currently, the political climate is not propitious 
for the Mexican Government to speed up the elimination of 
tariffs being demanded by the United States and Canada. 
Consequently, sources of the National Foreign Trade Council 
[Conacex] and the National Association of Mexican Importers and 
Exporters warned that the Commerce and Industrial Development 
Secretariat [Secofi] will not begin negotiations until after 
federal elections take place in Mexico. 
  Between June and September, the governments of the three 
countries will seek to correct NAFTA administrative deficiencies 
because there are bureaucratic hitches that still hinder the 
trade of products, representatives of local and U.S. chambers 
added. Businessmen also stated that the month granted by the 
Secofi to producers to conduct consultations and make the 
necessary studies is not enough. 
  Since October 1993, the Mexican, U.S., and Canadian 
Governments agreed to convene a new negotiation on NAFTA 
sections under Article 302, part three of the agreement. 
  Government representatives from the three countries held 
talks on the process from the latter part of 1993 until 23 May 
1994, the date on which the list of 157 products they decided to 
include in the first round of negotiations was published on the 
Official Gazette and the U.S. Federal Register. The list is a 
compendium of the proposals made by the private sectors of the 
three countries. Mexico seeks the expeditious elimination of 
tariffs for over 90 products, the United States for 47, and 
Canada for 31. 
  The U.S. list was the most modified because it dropped down 
to 47 products, after the United States had announced, last 
March, its intention to change schedules and tariffs for over 
600 line items. 
  Private sector sources revealed that Mexico has maintained 
higher tariffs for many products of U.S. interest, and 
underscored that the counterpart should keep in mind that the 
differences between the economies of the commercial partners 
were supposed to be reflected precisely in the schedules agreed 
upon for the elimination of tariffs. 
  To the contrary, the number of tariff reductions that Mexico 
would like the United States to implement in an accelerated 
manner seeks to dismantle the protectionist mechanisms in force 
in that country, because the United States has not carried out a 
"unilateral liberalization." 
  The resolution published in the Mexican Official Gazette 
indicates that within the month following the publication, 
Mexican productive sectors will determine which products with 
lower tariffs benefit Mexican businessmen. Sources consulted 
said then that two weeks after investigations conclude, Herminio 
Blanco, under secretary for international trade negotiations of 
the Commerce and Industries Development Secretariat, is expected 
to meet with U.S. and Canadian counterparts Rufus Yerxa and John 
Weekes, respectively, for a "give and take." 
  Since 23 May, representatives of the local chambers of 
products involved expressed their opposition to a process to 
eliminate tariffs. Within Conacex and ANIERM, businessmen have 
emphasized that the month designated for consultations is not 
enough and that it is rather hasty since NAFTA has only been in 
effect for five months. 
  The businessmen explained that, in addition to confusion 
among industrialists who have not recovered yet from the shock 
caused by the implementation of NAFTA, the political situation 
Mexico is currently facing is too precarious to implement an 
accelerated elimination of tariffs. The anonymous sources 
anticipated that the Mexican Government will not engage in any 
negotiations until after the 21 August elections. 
  "These are difficult political times, and the Mexican 
business sector is in no shape to conduct negotiations, a source 
added. However, they mentioned that representatives of the 
sectors involved in the process will have to ask Secofi for an 
extension. Meanwhile, representatives of U.S. and Mexican 
industrial chambers stressed that, thus far, U.S. and Mexican 
authorities will try to solve and eliminate the bureaucratic 
problems that hinder foreign trade. 
  Such topics as paperwork and excessive bureaucracy will be 
reviewed. Problems classifying products into line items have 
occurred in both the United States and Mexico, because each 
country has a different set of regulations. The use of 
certificates-of-origin and place-of-origin regulations 
constitute nontariff obstacles that have hindered trade in North 
America.

<F P=106> [By Salvador Rico] </F>
  [Excerpt] Yesterday, after the Mexican Chamber of Deputies 
authorized President Carlos Salinas' trip to Cuba and Colombia, 
the deputies agreed to donate one day's salary to buy oil and to 
ship it to the Caribbean island. 
  The proposal for this donation was made by the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party [PRI] deputies, and it was immediately 
backed by the legislators of the Party of the Democratic 
Revolution [PRD]. Regarding this cooperation, deputy Rodolfo 
Becerril Straffon said "it is of a symbolic nature, regardless 
of how much is collected" and "it implies Mexican congressional 
solidarity with the Cuban people." 
  In yesterday's session, the PRD bench denounced the fact 
that 
a former president of the National Association of the Processing 
Industry, Vicente Gutierrez Camposeco, is probably trying to 
secure votes illegally, and for this reason the General Council 
of the Federal Electoral Institute has been asked to carry out 
an investigation "to establish where its financial resources 
come from and whether such financing represents an electoral 
crime." 
  Deputy Jesus Martin del Campo said Gutierrez Camposeco sent 
a 
personal letter to businessmen urging them to bury their 
"political paralysis" and encourage their workers to vote "to 
avoid postelection conflicts." Gutierrez also sent the 
businessmen a biographical sketch of PRI presidential candidate 
Ernesto Zedillo. 
  Regarding President Salinas' visit request, the PRD bench 
said it agrees with the trip, but Deputy Martha Maldonado Zepeda 
made the following observation: "We believe it is necessary for 
the Mexican Government to change the ritual practiced by four 
administrations: a presidential visit to Cuba at the end of the 
six-year-term in office, when it cannot have any domestic weight 
and is a mere formality." 
  The PRD bench proposed that Salinas should discuss the need 
to fully reincorporate Cuba into the inter-American system as 
befits the new dynamics of international relations at the Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit to take place in Colombia." 
  Maldonado also said that "our solidarity must be expressed 
with specific and congruent actions, regardless of how small 
they might look." Deputy Maldonado noted that not permitting 
Cuba's integration to the San Jose Pact does not contribute to 
strengthening a modern international relations framework. 
  The authorization granted by the Chamber of Deputies allows 
the chief of state to be absent from the country, as of 10 June, 
for five days. It has been reported that in Cuba, Salinas will 
meet with Fidel Castro and, in Colombia, he will participate in 
the Fourth Ibero-American Summit where the issues of trade and 
integration as elements for development in the continent will be 
analyzed. 
  Regarding the presidential trip, the first to take the floor 
was Popular Socialist Party [PPS] Deputy Martin Tavira 
Uriostegui who referred to the recent visit of U.S. Congressman 
Roberto Torricelli to Mexico. He said: "In a cynical fashion, 
Mr. Torricelli is demanding that the Mexican people junk their 
nationalistic spirit, which is the result of lengthy battles for 
liberty and independence. He has come here to see what benefits 
he can derive from the country at a moment when we face some 
political problems, problems that only we can resolve, with 
sovereignty and nationalism." 
  In expressing the PPS' support for the presidential trip, 
Tavira said Salinas' visits are to promote economic, scientific, 
technological, and cultural integration with Cuba and Colombia. 
  In responding to the PRD comment, Deputy Becerril said 
Salinas' trip to Cuba "is not a ritual, it is a demonstration of 
congruence with and allegiance and fidelity to foreign policy 
principles and norms that have for many years prevailed in 
Mexico's foreign policy." [passage omitted]
