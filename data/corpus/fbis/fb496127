<F P=106> [Report by Salete Sobreira] </F>
  [Text] The Federal Supreme Court [STF] has upheld a legal 
provision that prohibits both political parties and candidates 
from accepting donations for electoral campaigning from trade 
unions and similar organizations. 
  Paragraph 6 of Article 45 of the law prohibits candidates 
and 
parties from receiving, whether directly or indirectly, any 
donation in money or in any other form that could be translated 
into money -- including any kind of advertisement -- from unions 
or similar organizations. 
  By a vote of six to three, the STF thus turned down a 
petition filed by the Workers Party to have the above law 
declared unconstitutional. Justice Sepulveda Pertence, who 
heard the case, voted with the minority. He believes that 
unlike unions, associations could make donations because they do 
not collect mandatory dues and contributions from their members. 
  Justice Neri da Silveira, who voted down the PT petition, 
said that the ban also affects associations, in order to prevent 
powerful economic organizations from committing excesses. The 
STF has ruled that the law will stand, but that it will be 
incumbent upon the Superior Electoral Court to rule on the case 
of PT presidential candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who is 
facing charges for having used a sound truck from the 
metalworkers union of the ABC region [Sao Paulo industrial belt] 
in his electoral campaign.

  [Text] Judge Alfredo Pfeiffer has acquitted [Carabineros 
Director] General Rodolfo Stange and other high-ranking retired 
Carabineros officers of the charge of nonfulfillment of military 
duties in the case involving the three slain Communist leaders 
[Manuel Parada, Santiago Nattino, and Manuel Guerrero, who died 
with cut throats]. The resolution was taken this afternoon, and 
the case is therefore dismissed. 
  Judge Pfeiffer had instituted proceedings following charges 
made by Judge Milton Juica in passing judgment on the murder of 
the Communist leaders. Gen. Stange and other members of the top 
echelon of Carabineros were among those accused of 
nonfulfillment of military duties. The Military Court appointed 
Judge Pfeiffer to conduct the inquest. Gen. Stange took a leave 
of absence and was given other tasks during the proceedings. 
Following the ruling by the Military Court, which confirmed the 
decision not to prosecute Gen. Stange, Judge Pfeiffer dismissed 
the case and acquitted all the high-ranking Carabineros officers 
against whom Judge Juica had brought charges.

  [Text] A meeting is taking place at this time in Santa Fe 
de Bogota to discuss the Penal Code. Participating in the 
meeting are Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff, Justice 
Minister Andres Gonzalez, and Attorney General Carlos Gustavo 
Arrieta. 
  Prosecutor General de Greiff has reappeared with firm steps. 
This time, speaking to Attorney General Arrieta, Justice 
Minister Gonzalez, and hundreds of agents of the Attorney 
General's Office, he defended the benefits of the law on 
surrender and reduction of penalties in Colombia, and questioned 
the double standards of the United States on the subject. 
  [Begin de Greiff recording] The United States criticizes 
Colombia because supposedly we have very mild sentences against 
drug traffickers, especially when they surrender to justice. 
They claim that the United States has the right system, which 
consists of very tough sentences. Those high sentences are 
applied to some Colombians, but I do not know of any case in 
which U.S. drug traffickers have given life sentences. [end 
recording] 
  De Greiff also referred to the possible surrender of Cali 
Cartel leaders. 
  [Begin de Greiff recording] I believe that would be their 
best choice because otherwise, the Prosecutor General's Office 
will continue its policy of pursuing them. [end recording] 
  With regard to the scandalous espionage case at the 
residence 
of Presidential Candidate Ernesto Samper, de Greiff said that 
espionage is a crime, and therefore those reports will be 
investigated. 
  De Greiff also proposed a legislative reform to monitor 
arrests in Colombia.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with National Registrar Luis Camilo </F>
Osorio in Santa Fe de Bogota by station announcer Dario 
Arizmendi and an unidentified reporter in Emisoras Caracol's 
Santa Fe de Bogota studios -- live] 
  [Text] [Arizmendi] We have National Registrar Dr. Luis 
Camilo Osorio with us this morning. There are 60 hours before 
the runoff election. Good morning, Mr. Registrar. 
  [Osorio] Good morning, Dario. 
  [Arizmendi] What will happen with the voters who have been 
affected by the earthquake and the mudslide in Cauca and Huila 
Departments? 
  [Osorio] At this time, Dario, we are in the process of 
collecting information on people who lost their personal 
identity papers during the tragedy. The information I have is 
not up-to-date. As of yesterday, however, we had received 
approximately 400 identity card replacement requests in Huila 
and Cauca. We plan to send registrars to places where people 
have been relocated so these people can vote. Registrars will 
use census forms. We will replace the relocated people's 
identity cards and tell them where they can vote. 
  [Arizmendi] Approximately 18,000 people have been relocated, 
many of whom have their identity cards. Can these people vote? 
  [Osorio] Yes, but the figures we have are much smaller. We 
estimate that 2,000 voters have been relocated. We are providing 
local registrars with additional census lists so the people can 
vote where they are. 
  [Arizmendi] People have begun to wonder: The Registrar's 
Office was so efficient during the first round that results were 
released before 2300 local, at least in 90 percent of the voting 
sites. What will happen next Sunday? Can we expect to have the 
name of the president-elect by 2000? 
  [Osorio] Yes, we will do it again, with the possible 
exception of two or three points. I have headed the Registrar's 
Office on three previous occasions, in 1991, 1992, and the first 
Congress elections in 1994. 
  [Arizmendi] So this election will set a record for the 
Office. 
  [Osorio] We will duplicate what we did during the first 
round 
of elections. 
  [Arizmendi] Do you think we will know who is ahead in the 
election by approximately 2100 local time? 
  [Osorio] It will depend on the relative position of the 
candidates, Dario. As you know, there is a virtual tie between 
the leading candidates, according to opinion polls. 
  [Arizmendi] At what time do you expect to release the first 
bulletin? 
  [Osorio] Well, it is not the first one that counts but the 
last one. Anyway, we think there must be a very significant 
margin of difference between the two. We estimate we will be 
able to release the first bulletin by the same time we released 
the first one during the first round, 1640 local time. 
  [Arizmendi] Mr. Registrar, what can you tell us about the 
people in the eastern flatlands, in southeastern Meta and 
Guaviare Departments, who are isolated because of flooded rivers? 
  [Osorio] Well, Dario, so far it has been unnecessary to 
relocate any voting sites. Some damaged installations will be 
repaired, but we will have no relocations of people here as 
happened in some Huila and Cauca municipalities. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Registrar, we continue to 
receive 
calls from many people who did not vote in the 1986 and 1990 
elections but who would like to vote in this runoff election. 
They ask us why they cannot vote, why their identity cards, if 
they failed to be registered, are not in the lists of the 
so-called line-up voting sites? 
  [Osorio] As we have explained before, the citizens who have 
not voted on previous occasions can do so now provided they are 
included on the list of persons who applied for their identity 
cards as of March 1988 when, by legal provision -- this is not a 
provision of the Registrar's Office or an administrative act 
apart from the state's sovereign willingness expressed through 
the Congress -- those persons were automatically included in the 
electoral counts. In each municipality, voting sites are 
prepared for these citizens to vote. Only these citizens can 
vote at these sites. The rest of the citizens must have been 
properly registered at the sites where they have chosen to vote. 
Unfortunately, whoever has not been registered and has not 
applied for his or her identity card after March 1988 is not 
included in the census and consequently will not be permitted to 
vote. 
  [Arizmendi] Mr. Registrar, will there be more or less than 
5.8 million votes, the number of people who voted in the first 
round? 
  [Osorio] Dario, we hope there will be more than 6 million 
votes. 
  [Arizmendi] [Words indistinct] 
  [Osorio] I beg your pardon? Oh yes, although there will be a 
soccer championship, there will be several matches. If people 
take advantage of the few working hours to find out where their 
voting sites are located, they can do their duty as citizens by 
casting their votes and still watch the soccer matches. For this 
reason, I think there will be more than 6 million votes.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the presidential election 
runoff scheduled for 19 June. 
  Conservative Party candidate Andres Pastrana has accused 
President Gaviria of breaking the principles that require his 
impartiality in electoral matters, asserting that Gaviria has 
clearly acted to expressly promote the candidacy of Liberal 
Party candidate Ernesto Samper. Pastrana said: "The political 
guarantees necessary for this campaign to take place under 
conditions of equality and impartiality do not exist." (Santa 
Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 9 Jun 94 p 6A) 
  Ernesto Samper asked former Envigado Mayor Jorge Meza, who 
faces a scandal as a result of presumed links with drug 
traffickers, to abstain from participating in campaign 
activities to promote his candidacy. Samper welcomed a 
statement by Bishops Conference President Pedro Rubiano, who 
said that the Catholic Church does not favor any candidate. He 
added that he "did not deem appropriate the strategy used by the 
other candidate to establish religious differences among 
Colombians." (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 9 Jun 94 
p 6A) 
  On 9 June, Ernesto Samper said that Pastrana has adopted an 
unnecessarily aggressive and intolerant position that does not 
benefit Colombian democracy. According to Samper, Pastrana "is 
thoroughly exploiting" the media "his family owns" to attack him 
politically and personally. President Cesar Gaviria yesterday 
told Pastrana that no actions by his government have sought to 
favor, openly or tacitly, any of the presidential candidates or 
to influence the current electoral contest. (Santa Fe de Bogota 
EL TIEMPO in Spanish 10 Jun 94 p 6A) 
  Ernesto Samper and vice presidential running mate Humberto 
de 
la Calle rejected on 10 June what they called a "dirty war" on 
the part of Andres Pastrana, whom they accused of seeking to 
provoke a "religious clash" in the country. During a news 
conference, he noted that "Pastrana's campaign, by resorting to 
the old slander policy, has spread accusations of all types that 
have made some prelates disregard the instructions made at the 
Bishops Conference." (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 
11 Jun 94 p 7A) 
  According to two polling companies cited by local media, 
Pastrana appears to be the favorite to win the 19 June 
elections. The figures created confusion among voters, because 
they contrast with the results obtained during the 29 May 
elections when Samper beat Pastrana by a narrow margin. 
(Hamburg DPA in Spanish 1825 GMT 11 Jun 94) 
  On 10 June, a telephone tap was discovered in Ernesto 
Samper's office. Samper said: "This is an unprecedented 
action, and whoever did it is a scoundrel." (Santa Fe de Bogota 
Inravision Television Canal A Network in Spanish 1800 GMT 11 Jun 
94) 
  Regarding the alleged telephone spying against Samper, 
Pastrana said: "That is not my style nor that of my campaign. I 
believe that the security organizations must clear up this 
situation and that, if there are any accusations, they must be 
made through the pertinent organizations." (Santa Fe de Bogota 
Emisoras Caracol Network in Spanish 1200 GMT 13 Jun 94) 
  Ernesto Samper ended campaign activities today to begin the 
last week of meetings with fellow Liberal leaders. Samper 
called attacks by Monsignor Dario Castrillon unfair, adding: 
"Liberals are also Catholics, and we will not accept having a 
conscientious veto among Colombians, because of an act of 
religious fanaticism inspired by Pastrana's campaign." Pastrana 
is also preparing to close the last week of his campaign. 
Pastrana stated: "I seek to govern for all Colombians, not just 
for a minority." (Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television 
Canal A Network in Spanish 1730 GMT 13 Jun 94) 
  During the weekend of 11 June Monsignor Dario Castrillon 
rejected Samper's alliance with Protestant groups and asked 
Catholic Liberals not to vote for Samper because, according to 
him, Samper promotes abortion and denies the rights of most 
Catholics. Pastrana denied any favoritism by the Church and 
said: "Colombians do not want a candidate such as Samper, who 
encourages violence. Colombians are weary of violence; we want 
peace. Nobody is stirring any clashes. Samper is the only one 
who has invented this war." Samper's campaign denied 14 June 
that their presidential program includes promoting abortion or 
denying the rights of Catholics. (Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision 
Television Canal A in Spanish 0000 GMT 15 Jun 94) 
  During an interview, Samper said he believes Pastrana does 
not have enough political experience because he has not occupied 
a post at the national level. He added: "I am willing to give 
Pastrana a ministry so that he may complete his training." The 
country wants changes and new spaces, which we are willing to 
open. The new country is the one that supports me, the blacks, 
Indians, independent sectors, and demobilized guerrillas, Samper 
concluded. (Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Cadena 1 in 
Spanish 0400 GMT 15 Jun 94)

  [Text] President Sixto Duran-Ballen has appointed Miguel 
Rosero Barba to be the new national police commander general. 
One of the new commander general's main tasks will be to 
strengthen ties with the media through open-door policies and by 
the necessary creation of a public relations division that will 
answer journalists' questions. 
  The new police commander general, Manuel Rosero, believes 
having the people's trust and confidence is an important 
condition for successful police work.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments monitored through 15 June. 
  The Central Bank of Ecuador, BCE, has issued its monthly 
report for March 1994. It states the Ecuadoran trade balance 
recorded a surplus of $104 million, a 41.3-percent increase over 
the same month last year. Exports totaled $250 million, and 
imports reached $146 million. Exports for the quarter were 4.6 
percent less, however, than in 1993, $688.8 million versus 
$722.4 million. Oil was, as usual, the major export item, with 
sales totaling more than $264 million for 20.3 million barrels. 
Exports of items other than petroleum produced $294.5 million 
during the quarter, approximately $100 million less than the 
first quarter of 1993. Nevertheless, Jose Riofrio, marketing 
manager for the National Banana Plan (Programa Nacional del 
Banano), said "the effects of the European Union import 
restrictions have not yet been felt in Ecuador." Shrimp sales 
dropped 10.6 percent, while coffee rose from $13 million to $21 
million. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 0023 GMT 12 June 94) 
  On 7 June, Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran-Ballen announced 
the response to the bid for oil exploitation rights "is the best 
proof the country has regained its prestige and confidence 
abroad." He announced 28 firms, grouped into 13 consortiums, 
participated in the bid. There are 17 well sites in six sectors 
of the Amazon region that are expected to require an overall 
investment of $141.7 million. The winners are Amoco-Mobil, 
Triton, Orix, City-Ramrod, and the Ecuadoran consortium 
Tripetrol. Francisco Acosta, energy and mines minister, has 
said the best guarantee for the investors "is the absolute 
honesty of the bid process." Contracts will be signed in 
November, and work is expected to begin in 1995. (Mexico City 
NOTIMEX in Spanish 0014 GMT 8 June 94) 
  Foreign currency reserves rose 3.3 percent in May, totaling 
$1.3 million. A BCE spokesperson has said this figure is $43 
million higher than in April. The increase "comes from higher 
prices for Ecuadoran petroleum on the international market." The 
official added that "despite the improved conditions abroad, 
gasoline prices continue to rise in Ecuador." (Quito Voz de los 
Andes in Spanish 2300 GMT 6 June 94) 
  Financial expert Luis Onofa, in an article for Quito's daily 
newspaper HOY, has said Ecuador's foreign debt has doubled in 12 
years. This, he said, "demonstrates that despite renegotiation 
efforts, liabilities continue to pierce the heart of the 
economy, halting all growth." Ecuador's debt was $6.63 billion 
in 1982, and it is $12.96 billion now. Previous administrations 
were unable to reach any favorable agreements with the 
international financial institutions, private banks, or the 
Paris Club. Sixto Duran-Ballen's administration has "managed to 
restructure the debt," however. Capital will be paid in 30 
years with a 45-percent discount, while overdue interest will be 
paid in 20 years on good terms and a 10-year grace period.

  [Text] Lima, 16 Jun (EFE) -- Peruvian President Alberto 
Fujimori said today in Lima that Cuba does not pose a threat to 
the Americas, and that an embargo against Cuba or against any 
other country in the world is therefore unjustified. 
  Fujimori made this statement after his return from Colombia, 
where he attended the Fourth Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena 
on 14 and 15 June. 
  Fujimori, who visited China and Japan before his visit to 
Colombia, said that what Latin America is currently spending on 
weapons should be invested in development. 
  Commenting on Peruvian domestic policy and former President 
Alan Garcia, who has been in asylum in Colombia since June 1992, 
Fujimori said: "I cannot accept an agreement with or even 
negotiate with a person who destroyed the country." 
  Recently there has been conjecture about a possible 
rapprochement between the government and the American Popular 
Revolutionary Alliance (APRA), the party led by Alan Garcia, who 
ruled Peru from 1985 to 1990.

  [Text] Former UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar 
has said that when he returns to Lima he will announce whether 
he will run for president of the Republic. In an exclusive 
interview with Radio Programas del Peru, Perez de Cuellar said 
he will arrive in Peru at the end of July or beginning of August. 
  [Begin recording] [Perez de Cuellar] You probably remember 
that as the UN secretary general I traveled to Lima during the 
months of July and December. This year I will do the same. I 
will probably arrive in Lima toward the end of July or beginning 
of August and I will remain there for the time necessary. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Will you announce your candidacy 
while you are in Lima? 
  [Perez de Cuellar] I believe it would be the correct thing 
to 
do should I decide to run for the presidency. [end recording] 
  Perez de Cuellar said that no one, not even the president of 
the Republic, can tell him that he does not know Peru. 
  [Begin Perez de Cuellar recording] The current president has 
been in office for only four years and I have been serving Peru 
for more than 40 years. The ratio is 10 to 1. Thus, I should not 
take lessons from anyone concerning the country's interests. I 
have tried to give prestige to the country. It is not fair to 
say that I do not know Peru. I repeat, from every country in the 
world I have always followed very closely my country's problems 
and I will not allow anyone, not even the president of the 
Republic, to say I am unaware of Peruvian problems. [end

  [Text] The two River Plate countries confirmed their 
geopolitical alliance on 10 June by signing notes on work to be 
carried out in the Martin Garcia channel, one of the two Parana 
River passageways to the Atlantic Ocean. 
  The work involves the Martin Garcia channel's dredging, 
buoying, and subsequent maintenance. The notes commit Argentina 
and Uruguay to sharing equally a $107 million payment to open 
the channel. 
  The governments still have two years to resolve their share 
percentages of future maintenance costs, which unofficially are 
estimated at $9 million. 
  For almost three years, a strong "lobby" [preceding word in 
English] of Argentine grain growers pressed for Argentina not to 
fulfill its obligations with Uruguay concerning the Martin 
Garcia channel and finance work in the Emilio Mitre channel, the 
other Parana River passageway. 
  Argentina's noncompliance would have been tantamount to 
disregarding the River Plate Treaty--signed by [former Argentine 
President] Juan Domingo Peron and [former Uruguayan President] 
Juan Maria Bordaberry in November 1973--on the management of the 
estuary and our country's river border. 
  In a speech during the signing of the notes, President 
Carlos 
Menem evoked Juan Domingo Peron's figure as a champion of 
American integration and promoter of the 10 June action. 
  For his part, President Lacalle stressed that the Martin 
Garcia channel work will allow linking Uruguay River ports with 
the rest of the world, and the river will be 32 feet deep. The 
work also will allow Nueva Palmira to become the waterway's 
entry port, linking the Atlantic Ocean with our continent's 
central region. 
  Incidentally, Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy, who 
is interested in the waterway's future and was invited to the 
notes' signing ceremony, arrived in our country. The Uruguayan 
Government also invited three former [Uruguayan] presidents, 
Washington Beltran, Jorge Pacheco, and Julio Sanguinetti, to 
witness the ceremony and confirm that the signed notes are part 
of the state's foreign policy.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Historic Agreement"] </F>
  [Text] Relations between states, just as friendship between 
common mortals, require constant attention, repair, and 
maintenance, particularly in the case of neighboring countries 
such as Argentina and Uruguay. The two countries are located in 
the vast geopolitical space created by the River Plate basin, 
which has a history that in many aspects unites them and in 
other cases separates them, giving each country its own and 
distinct personality. However, they also have shared economic 
interests that soon will materialize in Mercosur [Common Market 
of the South]. 
  As is common in all families, relations between the two 
nations have had their ups and downs. But if we have to make a 
list of elements that have not contributed to our family's 
harmony, it is probable that we will make a rather short list 
and include mostly minor items and some prejudices, which are 
unjustified but inevitable in peoples' relations. An outstanding 
place in the list probably will be occupied by the important and 
delicate issue of the administration and use of the River Plate. 
The issue is not new. It started with the Montevideo and Buenos 
Aires ports' rivalry during the vice royalty. 
  The suspicions and concerns rooted in the origins of our 
shared history were stirred by an extraordinary theory 
maintained by an Argentine foreign minister at the beginning of 
the century. Estanislao Zevallos maintained that Uruguay's 
borders were marked "by the line of the lowest River Plate 
tides," that is, the dry coast. We must admit, however, that 
such an astounding opinion never spread. This fact was confirmed 
with the signing of the Ramirez-Saenz Pena Protocol in January 
1910. During the following decades the two countries advanced 
gradually and methodically, overcoming more than one political 
storm, toward the creation of a juridical framework for 
resolving pending issues constructively. 
  The result of these efforts was the River Plate and Maritime 
Front Treaty signed by Argentina and Uruguay in November 1973. 
It can be said that the agreement was the result of particularly 
favorable circumstances, but it is also true that it represented 
the final stage of a long and historic process of convergence. 
The treaty's prologue establishes that the document's main 
purpose is to iron out difficulties derived from "all situations 
lacking juridical definition on the exercise of equal rights on 
the River Plate." 
  The treaty still is criticized in both countries. Those who 
criticize it are increasingly fewer, however. But no one can 
deny that the treaty established a solid framework of 
principles, norms, and institutions (bilateral commissions) that 
have contributed to the integral use of this vast and shared 
river and maritime area. 
  There is no doubt, then, that what was agreed on by both 
parties in the River Plate Administrating Commission on the 
dredging of the Martin Garcia channel, and the upcoming meeting 
of Presidents Carlos Menem and Luis Alberto Lacalle to 
officially present the documents on conditions for bidding on 
the channel dredging, have a major historic, economic, and 
political importance. The work that will be implemented jointly 
by Argentina and Uruguay is not only part of one of the biggest 
binational projects that will be undertaken within the treaty's 
framework. The work also will represent a large contribution by 
both River Plate countries to the vast River Plate basin's 
development. 
  The future of Mercosur and the Paraguay-Parana Waterway 
(Puerto Caceres-Nueva Palmira) depend to a good extent on free 
and cheap access for maritime transport services required to 
link producers with their trade partners abroad. The key to the 
river system has always been, and will continue to be, the River 
Plate's navigation channels. The work also will contribute to 
the development of Argentine and Uruguayan ports on the Uruguay 
River, which are not part of the Paraguay-Parana waterway but 
also have great development possibilities. 
  The Martin Garcia channel's dredging is a job that will 
benefit all river system users located upriver. Uruguay is only 
one of them and not precisely the most important user. It also 
will complement other projects now in the process of 
implementation. 
  The channel dredging agreement signed between Argentina and 
Uruguay represents a victory for common sense and the spirit of 
cooperation. The two River Plate countries' governments have 
constructively overcome difficult obstacles and agreed in 
advance to a shared undertaking that will benefit their peoples 
in addition to all the other people living in the River Plate 
basin.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Senate yesterday approved a 
bill on constitutional reform that will be confirmed by popular 
decision on 28 August. The possibility of voting for one 
candidate nationally and for another candidate departmentally 
(multiparty vote system) and several provisions on departmental 
governments are prominent among the constitutional reform 
innovations. 
  Even though the Senate vote was unanimous, it is not clear 
that all parties will campaign for the "Yes" ballot. At least 
two parties will not campaign for it. The Broad Front has yet to 
decide on this issue and the Batlleist Forum representatives 
pointed out that it does not support the multiparty vote system, 
but it does support advancing the plebiscite's date. 
  There were bitter arguments between the Battleism List 15 
faction and the Battleist Forum, which at times jeopardized the 
atmosphere of political agreement that surrounded the debate and 
vote on the constitutional reform bill. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] The Chamber of Deputies finally approved the 
constitutional reform bill this evening. The Chamber of Deputies 
president released a note this afternoon explaining the reasons 
that prompted the drafting of the current text, which gave rise 
to some observations by the Colorada and Batlleist Union. The 
bill was carried by 78 votes to one--that of Helios Sarthou of 
the MPP [People's Participation Movement]. The electoral court 
will now make arrangements for the plebiscite. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed interview with Vice President Gonzalo Aguirre </F>
"in the past few hours"--place not given] 
  [Excerpts] [EL PAIS] How will you conduct your electoral 
campaign? 
  [Aguirre] It will be based on a platform with clear and 
specific proposals to resolve the problems the country will face 
in 1995. We will not resort to personal attacks that are 
unworthy of the entire political system and especially of those 
who resort to this ignoble method. We also will not resort to 
deriding the ideas of our political opponents merely because we 
do not share all or some of their ideas. We will not even engage 
in unfavorably judging the national or departmental 
administration of other parties. It is not by monitoring the 
past or denying the success of former administrations--including 
our party's administration--that we will instill faith and 
optimism in the citizens. 
  [EL PAIS] What would be your first step if you were elected 
president of the Republic? 
  [Aguirre] I would call on the leaders of all parties, 
beginning with those of our own party, to form a coalition 
government and, if possible, a government of national unity. 
  [EL PAIS] What do you understand is a coalition government? 
  [Aguirre] It is a government formed by various parties that 
jointly establish the basic guidelines for the policies to be 
implemented, share their responsibilities, and support it, by a 
majority, in Congress. There is no such coalition government 
when these basic guidelines are exclusively established by the 
president of the Republic and his closest aides. There is no 
coalition government either when the president merely appoints 
citizens from other parties for both ministerial or autonomous 
agency posts. [passage omitted] 
  [EL PAIS] Do you agree with the current government's 
economic 
policy? If you were elected president, would you continue 
implementing the same policy? 
  [Aguirre] I agree with its basic guidelines, which are the 
following: the opening of the economy, regional economic 
integration, curbing inflation, and reducing the fiscal deficit. 
I do not share, however, a dogmatic implementation of this 
policy because I believe dogmatism is bad in all walks of life. 
  Therefore, if I were elected president, I would continue 
implementing these four basic guidelines, but with the 
flexibility required to adjust them to dynamic and changing 
realities. At any rate, I do not hope to conduct a government 
that will be a repetition of the current one. 
  [EL PAIS] In your opinion, what are the principal problems 
the next government will have to face? 
  [Aguirre] There are various problems like achieving 
conditions that will allow our producers and entrepreneurs to 
successfully compete within the framework of economic 
integration with our neighbors; implementing an effective 
decentralization, which will not be achieved by forming new 
organizations in Montevideo but by promoting new entrepreneurial 
projects harmoniously distributed throughout our national 
territory; reforming or updating our education system, adjusting 
it for our young people's required integration into the labor 
market; reforming social security, which in no way will violate 
the rights of existing retirees; defining the state's role and 
its reform so as to reduce the burden on productive activities; 
and--without finishing the list of issues to be 
resolved--implementing an agricultural, livestock, and 
industrial policy that will favor growth in our country's entire 
productive sector and create new and effective job openings. 
[passage omitted] 
  [EL PAIS] Will the constitutional reform be approved? Why 
are 
you supporting it? 
  [Aguirre] No doubt it will be approved. Obviously, most 
citizens agree with this reform. They especially support the 
so-called "multiparty voting" system. This is an unequivocal 
wish in the interior of our country. And a recent poll already 
indicates the resolute support of 66 percent of the voters. 
  As everyone knows, I am supporting this reform with profound 
conviction because I believe in free voting. For obvious 
reasons, it does not make any sense for a person who votes for a 
given party's presidential candidate to not be allowed to vote, 
if this is the person's idea, for another party's mayoral 
candidate. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Batllist Forum and the Party of the Government 
by the People [PGP] on 8 June signed a historic programmatic and 
electoral agreement at the Legislative Palace's Parties Hall. 
List 99 leader Renan Rodriguez, whose position was never too far 
from the Colorado Party and who opened the round of speeches at 
the ceremony, said the agreement is the result of a natural 
operation and "the soldering process will not leave rough edges" 
because, as in the past, both factions will form a single 
political entity. 
  PGP leader Hugo Batlle, who spoke afterward, did not talk 
about a return to basics or to his Colorado Party origins. He 
spoke about the importance of the agreement, stressing that it 
was made between "two different political groups with a common 
past" that are and will continue to be independent from each 
other. 
  Renan Rodriguez--without hiding his satisfaction over the 
agreement--compared former President Julio Maria Sanguinetti and 
Jose Batlle y Ordonez. He said Sanguinetti was "a natural 
candidate for the presidency of the Republic," just as Batlle 
was the Colorado Party's natural leader in 1910. He mentioned 
the difficulties each had during their first governments and 
stressed that in Batlle's case the people "very much wanted him 
to continue his work." Rodriguez said that something similar 
occurs today with Sanguinetti. 
  Batlle, in turn, characterized the ceremony as something 
that 
could change the country's future, adding that the Batllist 
forum as well as the PGP have given proof of their "deep civic 
courage." 
  "We are doing what people expected us to do long ago. People 
wanted to see leaders with courage to break the routine, the 
prejudice, the past, heal the old wounds," the List 99 leader 
said. 
  "Many things that happened in the past will not occur again, 
and many things that never happened will start occurring now, 
Batlle said [no end quotation mark as published]. The phrase was 
received with long applause. 
  He said he trusted the agreement will serve to build a 
better 
country for all Uruguayans "seeking equality from the beginning." 
<H5>  Sanguinetti: Count the Stones. </H5>
  The Batllist Forum leader [Luis Maria Sanguinetti] closed 
the 
ceremony with a speech that began with a citation from a great 
poet (Elliot) and was closed with a phrase that belonged to 
another famous artist. "We will begin by counting the stones so 
as to be able to finish counting the stars." 
  Referring to the agreement, Sanguinetti said the voices that 
called for it from the silent past have said: "We want unity 
among leaders so that unity can be possible among citizens." 
Sanguinetti said this was the reason he had taken "this hopeful 
step for unity." 
  "Today we have fewer rich people than during Batlle y 
Ordonez's times. We also have fewer poor people. But the needs 
and those in need have increased. A democratic society cannot 
accept the duality of having groups that reach modernity while 
other groups sink in degradation," Sanguinetti said, adding: "A 
country's sensitivity cannot be measured only by its respect for 
majorities but by its sensitivity toward minorities." 
  Sanguinetti said we cannot have "another irrational 
confrontation between the state and the market" similar to the 
confrontation between cities and rural areas. "The country needs 
of all its citizens. A modern society needs us all," the leader 
said.

    [Editorial Report] Montevideo EL PAIS in Spanish on 5 June 
publishes on pages 6-7 an unattributed 2,000-word article on 
voting preferences for the upcoming elections. The article says 
the Colorado Party, which now includes the voting preferences of 
the Party of the Government by the People, PGP, followers who 
support the Julio Maria Sanguinetti-Hugo Batlle ticket, now 
would "receive 33 percent of votes nationwide; the Broad Front, 
FA, would receive 24 percent of the votes; the National Party 
would receive 22 percent of the votes; the dissident PGP, the 
Civic Union, and the Christian Democratic Party would receive 2 
percent of the votes; the Green Party would receive 1 percent of 
the votes; other parties (including the Blue Party as well as 
other leftist groups not linked to the FA) would receive 2 
percent of the votes; and 16 percent of the voters have not yet 
decided for whom they would vote." 
  The article adds: "The National Party, which received 
significant support in April, continues growing and has 
improved, but by only one percentage point. The Colorado Party 
has grown 3 percentage points compared with last month's 
support, probably thanks to the PGP followers who will vote for 
the Sanguinetti-Batlle ticket. The FA standing has remained 
unchanged since April."

  [Excerpt] Most of the University of the Republic's nearly 
60,000 students will return to classes on 13 June. But they will 
no longer occupy buildings or demonstrate for bigger budgets. 
They will come to study, if they want. 
  On 9 June, the four university associations decided to lift 
the strike that halted classes and research at the university. 
The strike lasted 45 days but teachers and employees continued 
receiving their salaries. 
  The strike started on 25 April. It was staged in demand of a 
20 percent salary increase [for faculty members] that, according 
to students, was the cost of living increase last year and was 
what the government promised to give the faculty in April 1993. 
  What students finally got was a 6 percent increase through a 
law approved by Congress that interpreted a previous decision 
and that, according to the University Inter-Association, "merely 
corrected the illegal discrimination against the university." 
The students also collected 436,400 signatures in support of a 
plebiscite proposing a constitutional amendment to assure bigger 
education budgets in general. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Cecilia Cayone; from the "Union Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Noris Aguirre, president of the Deposit Guarantee 
and Banking Protection Fund [Fogade], has announced Fogade is 
considering the possibility of increasing the guarantee ceiling 
for depositors from 4 to 10 million bolivares. 
  [Begin recording] [Cayone] Noris Aguirre made this 
announcement after being summoned for questioning by the Senate 
Financial Commission. She added that a decision in this regard 
will be made in coming days and that Fogade's board of directors 
is already considering the request on the public credit law so 
that the Finance Ministry may obtain an approval from the 
Central Bank of Venezuela. 
  Congressional financial commissions will be able to voice 
their opinions once an approval is granted, and the 
corresponding bonds will be issued. Along this line and in light 
of presumed resistance by certain sectors to accept the bonds, 
Aguirre has said Fogade has the mechanisms to place them on the 
market. 
  [Aguirre] What I have heard is a verbal reference to a 
statement that anyone could have made, but that has not been the 
Banking Council's position. This view has not resulted from 
discussions, and whenever bonds are issued and placed on the 
market, Fogade will be able to place them through either the 
financial system, the Central Bank of Venezuela, or agents in 
the open market. We will talk with all sectors involved to 
implement this measure. 
  [Cayone] Meanwhile, Banks Superintendent Cesareo Cadenas, 
whom the Senate Financial Commission has also summoned, has said 
that as long as funds are not made available, depositors will 
not be paid. 
  [Cadenas] That matter is not for the superintendency or the 
Board of Interventors [word indistinct] to decide; it depends on 
several organizations. First, it depends on the Finance 
Ministry; second, the Central Bank of Venezuela; third, 
Congress. Interventors will be able to dispose of the funds once 
this is implemented. I hope that whenever they have the funds to 
make the payments, the programs will be ready. We will be able 
to announce them to the public but, rather, with the funds on 
hand. 
  [Cayone] But when will you begin to pay the accounts of the 
[word indistinct] banks? 
  [Cadenas] Once the public credit law is approved. 
  [Cayone] Even though Aguirre has said the possibility of 
increasing the guarantees for depositors is being considered, 
Gustavo Roosen, commissioner for financial reforms, has insisted 
payments will not exceed 4 million bolivares. Roosen was also 
summoned for questioning in Congress regarding the deposits made 
by the Caracas Mayoralty into Latino Bank. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Zayra Pereira; from the "Union Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] In a communique issued by the National Banking 
Council, which met the morning of 15 June, representatives of 
the financial sector expressed their position on the 
government's abrupt decision to intervene in seven banks and one 
finance company. (Jose Monzi Izquierdo), National Banking 
Council president, read the communique: 
  [Begin (Monzi Izquierdo) recording] The National Banking 
Council and the Venezuelan Banking Association would like to 
clearly express our amazement on the decision to intervene and 
close a group of financial institutions that were receiving 
financial assistance from Fogade [Deposit Guarantee and Banking 
Protection Fund]. The government has adopted that decision 
without notifying the financial sector, and that is why we have 
been unable to understand the logic behind such a measure. 
  As such, we neither share nor support this decision. We join 
the rest of the country's desire to be kept fully informed on 
the fate that awaits these institutions. In addition, we request 
that depositors and employees be treated with justice and 
fairness. [end recording] 
  (Jose Monzi Izquierdo) has reiterated an official position 
regarding the closure and intervention of the financial 
institutions will be announced after they receive a clear 
explanation of the issue; he has also expressed his desire to 
become actively involved in assisting the financial institutions 
due to their decision to trust the government's support.

  [Text] A Finance Ministry bulletin states that the banks 
that were subject to intervention will reopen on 20 June. This 
bulletin confirms guarantees stipulated by law for deposits up 
to 4 million bolivares, an amount that covers all the claims 
[nominas] these banks have received. 
  Private commercial banks, which will provide the funds to 
make payments to depositors, have not made a decision yet on the 
purchasing of bonds to be issued by Fogade. Representatives of 
the banking sector expressed their surprise yesterday over the 
government decision to intervene eight financial institutions. 
  During a joint news conference, (Jose Monzi Izquierdo), 
president of the National Banking Council, and Juan Tomas 
Santana, president of the National Banking Association, said 
they do not agree with the decision, because the executive did 
not inform them. 
  (Izquierdo) asked for justice and fairness for employees and 
depositors of the intervened banks. Meanwhile, Santana said he 
does not disagree with the decision to intervene the banks, but 
he resents not being informed. Representatives of the banking 
sector reiterated that once they receive the government's 
explanations on the case, the financial sector will voice its 
official position. 
  Meanwhile, according to Congress President Eduardo Gomez 
Tamayo, the executive must give the public extensive 
explanations on the intervention of these financial 
institutions. Tamayo has said the prevailing circumstances of 
this sector are unsavory and alarming, because the fate of 
depositors has not yet been determined. 
  The Congress president has said the parliamentarian blocs 
are 
refining details to discuss constitutional reforms. 
  In another turn of events, the Chilean Government has 
offered 
financial counsel to our country to overcome the crisis 
triggered by the intervention of the eight banks. Chilean 
President Eduardo Frei has made this offer to his Venezuelan 
counterpart, Rafael Caldera, who met with Frei to discuss 
topical issues. The Chilean counsel could help our country a 
great deal, because Chile experienced a similar financial crisis 
in 1983, when the military regime intervened five private banks 
and closed two others. The cost of the Chilean bank intervention 
amounted to up to $4 billion-worth of subsidies. These five 
banks owe $3.5 billion to the Chilean Central Bank.

  [Text] Caracas, 16 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Venezuelan police 
found 42 gasoline bombs at a high school in the capital today. 
Meanwhile, student protests against the government continue. 
  Orlando Hernandez, chief of the Metropolitan Police (PM), 
told the press his men had also found enough fuel and containers 
to make an additional 50 Molotov cocktails. The materials were 
found at Andres Eloy Blanco High School. 
  Student demonstrations worsened in the last few hours, in 
protest of the repression against student activities, the high 
cost of living, the plans to increase fares for urban 
transportation, and the government's poor handling of the 
banking crisis. 
  Hundreds of depositors of the eight banks in which the 
government intervened yesterday gathered outside the head 
offices of these institutions in an attempt to pressure the 
government into allowing them to withdraw their money. 
  The government will administrate the funds of the eight 
intervened banks. Depositors will be allowed to have access to 
only a portion of their money. 
  A group of students from a high school in the western 
section 
of Caracas hurled rocks and gasoline bombs at riot police, who 
responded with tear gas to disperse the demonstrators. Two 
policemen were injured in the clashes and taken to nearby 
hospitals. 
  In other cities around the country, such as Maracaibo, 
Barquisimeto, and Valencia, protests continued for a third 
consecutive day. In light of this, the National Guard has moved 
in. 
  Local news media have reported 100 peasants were arrested in 
the town of Turen, 400 km from Caracas, after staging 
demonstrations to protest high prices and looting several stores. 
  Defense Minister Rafael Montero has accused Lieutenant 
Colonel Hugo Chavez Frias (who led the February 1992 coup 
attempt) of being one of the instigators of the recent wave of 
protests the country has experienced.

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, 16 Jun (EFE) -- 
Chilean President Eduardo Frei has reported to EFE that, at the 
end of a 30-minute meeting in this city, where the Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit was closed yesterday, he and Cuban 
President Fidel Castro today agreed to seek a coordinated 
solution of the case of eight Cubans who entered the Chilean 
consulate in Havana on Wednesday. 
  "The two countries' foreign ministries will work together 
for 
a solution," Frei said. He admitted that this is a complex 
problem and that Castro reiterated to him his government's 
position of not authorizing the departure of anyone who resorts 
to forceful measures to secure a departure. 
  Frei described as positive his meeting with Castro, a 
meeting 
held to review current bilateral relations. Frei said Castro 
showed considerable interest in the Chilean Government's social 
programs to eliminate extreme poverty. 
  As for resuming diplomatic relations, Frei said this 
possibility will be considered during Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina's visit to Santiago late in August. 
Nevertheless, Frei pointed out that the current status of 
relations, on a consular level, is adequate "for the time being." 
  Frei reiterated both his rejection of the U.S. economic 
blockade against Cuba and the need for Cuba to implement a more 
democratic form of government, but that any decisions on this 
subject "can be made by the Cuban Government only." 
  Frei added that Castro, "respectfully and with a friendly 
disposition," listened to the recommendations made by most of 
the heads of state and government attending the Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit. "Everything depends on him (Castro)," he 
said. 
  Before meeting with Castro, Frei had a working breakfast 
with 
the presidents of El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala, and 
Honduras, as well as with Nicaraguan, Panamanian, and Dominican 
officials, and he later met with Paraguayan President Juan 
Carlos Wasmosy. 
  Most of the discussion at these meeting consisted of Chile's 
cooperation programs with these countries in several fields 
related to education and culture, as well as commercial and 
financial cooperation, Frei said. He termed the conversations 
"very positive." 
  In a news conference later, Frei reiterated his positive 
assessment of the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, saying it can be 
the starting point for "a true integration process."

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 16 Jun (EFE) -- Cuban President 
Fidel Castro believes that the entrance of Cubans into embassies 
and consulates in Havana does not constitute "any type of 
political problem." 
  In statements to Radio Cadena Nacional (RCN), from Cartagena 
de Indias, where he attended the Fourth Ibero-American Summit of 
Chiefs of State and Government, Castro said "the principal cause 
is that the people want to emigrate." 
  Dozens of Cubans have entered the Belgian and German 
diplomatic and consular missions in the Cuban capital in the 
past few days requesting "political asylum." 
  "They do so," Castro told RCN, "to promote illegal 
departures 
from the country and to promote incidents in order to reap 
political dividends." He added that "in our country, whoever 
wants to leave can do so."

  [Text] Cuban President Fidel Castro said in the Colombian 
city of Cartagena de Indias, where he attended the Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit, that Cuba has its own means of popular 
participation and there is no exclusive model of democracy. 
  In statements to the U.S. television network CNN, the top 
Cuban leader said that popular participation on the island is 
more practical than in the rest of Latin America. 
  Castro said Latin America's land and wealth distribution 
systems are among the worst in the world and that Cuba, 
meanwhile, has made the greatest social progress in the 
hemisphere's history. 
  As for the Ibero-American summits, Castro underscored the 
positive mark they have left in addition to fostering friendship 
among the nations of the region. 
  Regarding the U.S. blockade against the island, Castro 
explained that he had to attend the summit to express his 
concern about the lack of opposition to that unfair measure 
aimed at making the Cuban people give in to hunger. He also 
described as complex the issue of Cuba's possible reinstatement 
to the OAS, adding that it is being considered.

  [Text] The Barbados Labor Party [BLP] has refuted charges 
that it is not ready for general elections. BLP public 
relations person Tony Alton was responding to remarks by the 
leader of the National Democratic Party, Dr. Richie Haynes, that 
the BLP is not in a position to contest an upcoming election. 
Mr. Alton said the leadership issue in the party has already 
been settled, with Owen Arthur at the head. He also disclosed 
that the BLP has candidates for all the constituencies and some, 
he says, have already been elected. 
  [Begin Alton recording] Currently lifetime members [words 
indistinct], each of them has indicated that they will, if 
selected, run on behalf of the BLP again. There are several of 
us that have been nominated and endorsed by the national council 
to represent the party at the next election. These would be 
(Liam Artley), Duncan Carter, Blaine Clark, (Romel Marshall), 
and myself. There are another six nominations that are on 
schedule for the end, rather, by the end of July. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile BLP MP Delisle Bradshaw is still not sure when he 
is returning home. Bradshaw missed last week's historic 
no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Erskine Sandiford as 
he had to obtain medical treatment in Antigua. Speaking with 
(Novodin Busta) from Antigua, Bradshaw indicated that he was 
still in a lot of pain and was awaiting word from his physician 
on when he could return to Barbados. 
  [Begin Bradshaw recording] I am still seeing my doctor. I am 
hoping to be back, [pauses] will be returning to see my doctor 
again on Friday. I hope that I will be fit to travel to return 
home. [end recording] 
  Mr. Bradshaw also reiterated that he had intended to be in 
Barbados for last week's vote. He said he left the 14th 
Caribbean General Insurance Conference overseas ahead of its 
conclusions when he heard that the debate on the motion was 
pending. The MP noted that he is ready to defend his name and 
respond to the rumors about why he missed the no-confidence 
motion upon his return to Barbados. He noted that he would be 
speaking to his party leader, constituents, and the Barbadian 
public on this very contentious issue. 
  [Begin Bradshaw recording] I was in Belize some time last 
week. Then last week, week before when I was called and told to 
return home for the no-confidence motion, and I will return to 
Barbados. [sentence as heard] [end recording]

  [Text] San Jose, 16 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- Costa Rican courts 
today denied the U.S. request to extradite Hubert Matos Araluce, 
son of Cuban anti-Castro leader Hubert Matos, who is wanted by 
U.S. authorities for fraud. 
  The Fourth Constitutional Chamber's decision, which was 
disclosed today, confirmed that Matos Araluce has been a Costa 
Rican citizen since 24 March, according to a National 
Immigration Council agreement. 
  The extradition request, the higher court emphasized, was 
made after Costa Rican citizenship was granted to Matos Araluce, 
who is currently entitled to the protection of Costa Rican laws. 
The higher court indicated in its decision that the 
Constitution stipulates that no Costa Rican citizen, either by 
birth or naturalization, can be deported or extradited from the 
country. 
  The decision also required the state to compensate Matos 
Araluce for damages. In the extradition request, submitted by 
the U.S. Embassy in San Jose, Matos Araluce is accused of 
repeated fraud in Florida.

  [Text] Military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Napoleon 
Santos Aguilar, announced yesterday that the Senior Council of 
the Armed Forces, during an extraordinary session, decided to 
make routine changes in the positions of the Armed Forces 
hierarchy to energize the Armed Forces. 
  According to Santos Aguilar's announcement, Colonel Mario 
Raul Hung Pacheco, formerly the commander general of the Public 
Security Force (FSP), is now commander general of the Army. 
  Meanwhile, former Army commander General Guillermo Paredes 
is 
now inspector general of the Armed Forces, replacing Filander 
Armijo Ucles, who will now be an adviser to the 
commander-in-chief. 
  At the head of the FSP is Colonel Roberto Lazarus Lozano, 
who 
was formerly chief of the Armed Forces General Staff, a post 
that will now be filled by Colonel Luis Alonso Villatoro Villeda. 
  Also promoted was General Hector Castro Cabus, general 
commander of the Honduran Air Force (FAH), who will now be an 
adviser to the commander-in-chief. Currently at the head of the 
FAH is Air Force Colonel Oscar Servellon Moradel. 
  It has also been announced that Police Colonel Julio Cesar 
Chavez is now chief of the FSP General Staff. 
  The Directorate of the National Defense College is now 
headed 
by Artillery Colonel Jose Luis Nunez Bennet, who was formerly 
the director of the Armed Forces Command and Staff School which, 
as of today, will be directed by Colonel Jose Francisco Davila 
Nolasco, who was formerly the chief of Armed Forces General 
Staff operations. 
  Colonel Julio Armando Pavon Rodriguez, who until yesterday 
was director of the National Defense College, is now assistant 
joint chief of staff, replacing Colonel Claudio Lainez Coello, 
who is now an adviser to the commander-in-chief. 
  Colonels Jose Santos Ortez Pena, Luis Alberto Soto Ponce, 
Inocente Borjas Santos and Alberto Urcira Reyes, are now the 
respective heads of: the Office of Joint Chief of Staff 
Operations C-3, the General Staff Directorate of Civilian 
Affairs C-5, the Directorate of Recruitment C-7, and the General 
Secretaryship of the General Staff. 
  Colonel Guillermo Pinel Calix, who was Armed Forces director 
of operations and maintenance until yesterday, is now director 
of Military Intelligence C-2. 
  Military Spokesman Napoleon Santos Aguilar pointed out that 
Joint Chief of Staff General Lazaro Melanio Avila Soleno was 
confirmed in the post by Armed Forces Chief General Luis Alonso 
Discua Elvir. 
  Col. Santos explained that certain departments of the 
different branches of the Armed Forces can now be changed 
because the new chiefs and commanders have been authorized to do 
so. 
  He pointed out that certain officers were appointed to 
advisory positions because their experience renders them more 
useful to the commander-in-chief. 
  Col. Santos explained that this was not the case on this 
occasion, but certain officers who have reached retirement age 
must retire from the Army. "At this time, however, the officers 
of the Sixth Graduating Class have simply been appointed to 
advisory positions," he said. 
  [Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish at 2137 GMT on 15 June 
publishes a similar a 300-word report on the changes within the 
Honduran Armed Forces hierarchy. The report says the changes 
are indicative of "difficulties" within the Armed Forces, and 
adds that "the Armed Forces have begun to get rid of certain 
officers who have been publicly accused of illicit enrichment."]

    [Editorial Report] Santa Cruz de la Sierra EL MUNDO in 
Spanish on 3 June, page 13, carries a 650-word report by Roberto 
Mendez on the dismantling of a cocaine laboratory, capable of 
producing 600 kg of cocaine per month, near Puerto Pacheco by 
members of the Special Antinarcotics Force, FELCN. The 
laboratory was found on 1 June in an inaccessible area between 
two branches of the Grande River. It had separate areas to 
produce and pack cocaine. In one area the drug enforcement 
force found 12 barrels, each containing 200 liters of ether and 
another 10 barrels of acetone. FELCN commander Colonel Hector 
Frias said nobody was arrested because the traffickers fled 
after being alerted by a lookout who used a communications 
system.

  [Text] For years the Investigative Police intelligence 
brigade has been dogging the steps of the Lautaro Group leaders. 
Investigative Police detectives arrested Pablo David Contreras 
Olivos, aka Jose Luis or Joam, yesterday in the vicinity of the 
Plaza Italia. Contreras Olivos, who has been identified as the 
current number two Lautaro Group leader, was in charge of the 
group's military structure. He was arrested along with Maria 
Angelica Medina Soto, aka La Cuca. She led the MAPU-Lautaro 
[United Popular Action Movement, Lautaro Group]. 
  Through these arrests the police were able to establish that 
Guillermo Ossandon was in Cartagena, where he had been residing 
for some time. The police arrested Ossandon in a telephone 
booth in Cartagena. He did not offer any resistance. Along 
with Ossandon, the police also arrested his companions Sandra 
del Carmen Ramirez Barahona, and Flor Ines Alcallaga Cepeda. 
  [Begin Investigative Police Public Relations Chief Luis 
Cariz 
recording] All the investigations leading to the arrest of these 
people were conducted on the basis of a decree issued by Judge 
Dreiser, who has already been duly informed. We also asked 
Judge Dreiser to authorize an extension of the detention period 
in Investigative Police barracks for up to 10 days. 
  We are now proceeding to compare the existing evidence with 
their testimony, so as to establish their involvement in the 
numerous crimes with which they have been charged. [end 
recording] 
  The government praised the Investigative Police for their 
work, and commended the successful investigation that led to 
breaking up the guerrilla group. 
  [Begin Interior Ministry Under Secretary Belisario Velasco 
recording] During the operations officials seized the following 
guns: one pistol, four revolvers, nine sawed-off Tamara 
shotguns, and two double barrel shotguns. 
  We must also praise the Investigative Police intelligence 
brigade's professionalism in planning and conducting this 
operation. We must also praise them for the fact that no one was 
injured. 
  As is well known, in the last couple of years the police 
force has been increasingly coordinating its actions to 
effectively comply with their role as established in the 
Constitution. [end recording] 
  Guillermo Enrique Ossandon Canas, alias Diego Carvajal, 
established the Lautaro Youth Movement in 1983. With a 
dissident MAPU group Ossandon was able to establish an 
organization that later developed into the Lautaro Rebel and 
Popular Front [FRPL] Forces. Since then homicides, bomb attacks, 
bank holdups, and armed propaganda actions increased 
considerably in Chile. 
  FRPL forces first centered their actions in the southern 
region of Santiago. Later they expanded their operations to 
other regions. A few years ago the police arrested some FRPL 
leaders. On one occasion the police almost arrested Ossandon, 
but he was able to escape. In view of this the Investigative 
Police special corps took action only after the entire operation 
had been secured. They decided nevertheless to delay the 
operation so as not to allow Ossandon to escape in the dark. 
  The Lautaro Movement leaders were brought in from the coast 
aboard an airplane. They are currently under arrest at a 
Santiago Investigative Police barracks. 
  Fearing extremist reprisals, the Investigative Police have 
reinforced the guards throughout its units. Moreover, personnel 
from several police precincts will take turns watching the 
Lautaro Movement leaders. 
  The Interior Ministry will submit an injunction against the 
five arrested Lautaro Movement members, who have been charged 
with terrorist actions. In the next few days they will be 
placed at the disposal of Judge Arnoldo Dreiser, who is in 
charge of investigating the crimes perpetrated by the Lautaro 
Group crimes.

  [Text] Taranco Palace was the seat of the meeting between 
the Argentine, Paraguayan, and Uruguayan presidents in which the 
bid for dredging the Martin Garcia channel [in the River Plate] 
was awarded. The chiefs of state reaffirmed the intent and need 
for a regional integration system, and the importance this 
system has for the area's countries, and to which Chile's desire 
to become a member of Mercosur [Common Market of the South] must 
be added. 
  Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle firmly pointed out 
the common projects the country has with Argentina and the fact 
that they have a solid footing, emphasizing the dredging of the 
Martin Garcia and Mitre channels. Lacalle explained the current 
stage in which the two countries now are permanently sharing the 
costs and maintenance of the common projects. He added that the 
[Paraguay- Parana Rivers] waterway, the road network, and the 
Colonia [Uruguay]-Buenos Aires bridge are projects that ratify 
the confidence and overall actions that go beyond governments, 
and he termed these initiatives a "positive vision of goodwill 
with an eye on regional integration." 
  Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy termed the meeting 
a 
historic event, and he highlighted the fact that the Argentine 
and Uruguayan presidents are undertaking the dredging of Martin 
Garcia channel, which is something that marks the intention of 
uniting, of integrating the region's countries, and he pointed 
out Mercosur as a sign of the desire to integrate. Wasmosy 
indicated that his country cannot remain outside this effort 
because Paraguay needs a sea outlet with lower freight costs in 
order to become more competitive in international markets. He 
also referred to the importance of the waterway that will join 
the region's five countries. 
  Argentine President Carlos Menem emphasized the integration 
process, indicating that these three brother countries are 
walking a common path that is leading them to regional 
integration. He referred to the River Plate Treaty and the 
Maritime Front signed 21 years ago by then-Presidents Juan Maria 
Bordaberry and General Juan Domingo Peron, pointing out that 
even at that time Peron spoke about regional integration, 
stressing that countries must be "united, not dominated." Menem 
said trade "is the soul of nations," indicating that the river 
projects are very important and help link countries. He 
announced that within a few days that Salto Grande 
[hydroelectric project on the Uruguay River] will be put into 
operation with Paraguay's Asilerta Dam [as published] and thus 
integrate it with the free trade zone as its central objective. 
Menem also indicated that the Chilean Government had submitted a 
note in which it indicates that it has the intention of joining 
Mercosur, in other words, expressing its concern regarding an 
expansion of the integration spectrum. 
  Lacalle said that for Uruguay this treaty means the 
"definite 
opening of its river ports to international trade with an outlet 
to the Atlantic that has a depth of 32 feet." He added that the 
treaty also means that the ports of Nueva Palmira and Montevideo 
will be given a new life, and the same will apply to all the 
ports within the basins of the Paraguay, Parana, and Uruguay 
Rivers. Lacalle said: "This must be complemented with the 
importance of the waterway--3,000 km of rivers--that has a 
common legal statute that was ironed out by five nations and 
will allow the products of Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia, 
southern Brazil, and Uruguay to reach the Atlantic, and thus the 
world." 
  The Uruguayan president believes it "is an undertaking that 
will be written into history as one of the most truly 
influential and real endeavors of our countries." 
  Menem said the documents' signing means "the end of a 
process 
that began more than 20 years ago with the signing of the River 
Plate Treaty on 19 November 1973. This cycle began at that time 
and it concludes with the documents that were signed today that 
will make the Parana River, the Martin Garcia channel, and, of 
course, the River Plate navigable." 
  Referring to reports about alleged threats received by 
Argentine Ambassador to Uruguay Alicia Martinez Rios, Menem 
said: "All of us involved in the world of politics receive 
threats. Moreover, he added that he had to acknowledge that 
Martinez Rios has a lot of courage and is very enterprising. And 
I also must acknowledge that in a large measure it is thanks to 
her and her always-positive attitude that this document has been 
signed." 
  On leaving Taranco Palace, the three presidents chatted with 
the media. 
  Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy gave his opinion on 
the ceremony that had just concluded. He said: "Both for Bolivia 
and Paraguay, in their role as landlocked countries, these 
documents that were signed today (yesterday) basically mean that 
we have an outlet to the Atlantic through two very important 
corridors." 
  "I would like this project, which has concluded happily 
today, to be joined with another outlet to the Atlantic that is 
located just a little more to the north: the port of Pederneira 
[Brazil] "so the Southern Cone countries will really become 
integrated when the Itaipu Dam is completed and inter-river 
navigation begins."

<F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno at the Miraflores Presidential </F>
Palace; from the "Union Radio News" newscast] 
  [Text] Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom has asserted 
that the wave of rumors that has hit the country in the past 
days is part of a psychological war to keep Venezuelans in a 
state of constant anxiety. The interior minister referred to the 
unremitting rumors that have reappeared in the past days and 
added that they are meant to create a climate of uncertainty so 
as to inflame the people or cause a coup. Also, Defense Minister 
Rafael Montero Revette was called on to appear before the 
Congress and, during his remarks, got to the point of saying 
that Commander Hugo Chavez Frias was a subversive. 
  [Begin recording] [Escovar Salom] The number of rumors that 
have been circulating in the past days are part of a 
psychological war. Certain people have wanted to start this 
psychological war to keep the Venezuelans in constant anxiety. 
They are, however, only rumors and gossip. The government cannot 
respond every time a person spreads a rumor. 
  [Reporter] [question indistinct] 
  [Escovar Salom] The Interior Ministry does have a great deal 
of information but I don't have any to give to you at this time. 
  [Reporter] [question indistinct] 
  [Escovar Salom] Basically, it is only rumors, rumors, and 
more rumors. [end recording] 
  Minister Escovar Salom did not say if the government's 
intervention in eight banks would prompt public disorder in the 
country. The students did riot outside the Central Venezuelan 
University on Wednesday, but the minister did not give 
importance to those events. He said they were all street gossip 
which did not merit great significance. As usual, however, he 
promised to give reporters more details at a later date on the 
groups promoting the rumors to destabilize the country.

  [Text] While in Cartagena de Indias, where he attended the 
Fourth Ibero-American Summit, Guatemalan President Ramiro de 
Leon Carpio discussed the Central American governments' request 
to U.S. President Bill Clinton that the U.S. Government 
implement the benefits approved for Central America in the 
framework of the Caribbean Basin Initiative [CBI]. 
  [Begin De Leon recording] We addressed a note to him 
expressing our concern regarding the agreements reached during 
GATT's Uruguay Round on 15 April, whereby the U.S. Government 
would apply a tariff on its beef imports. In our note, we 
pointed out that this decision would have a negative effect on 
economic reactivation and the consolidation of stability in our 
countries. For this reason, we emphasized in our note that the 
current concept of economic development and the United States' 
new foreign policy in Central America emphasize trade more than 
they do aid. We told President Clinton that, to be consistent 
with this policy, CBI benefits should continue to cover all of 
our beef exports without volume limitations, because, as we all 
know, cattle raising in Latin America plays a very important 
role in economic reactivation, job creation, and, of course, 
exports. We expect a favorable answer to this request. [end

  [Text] Central America succeeded in securing more than $700 
million during the Fourth Ibero-American Summit held in 
Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, on 14 and 15 June, regional 
presidents have reported. 
  Returning from Colombia yesterday, the presidents said 
Spanish President Felipe Gonzalez said he would announce Spain's 
incorporation into the BCIE [Central American Economic 
Integration Bank] as a foreign country member in 30 days. 
  In addition, the regional presidents secured Colombia's 
pledge to become a member and contribute $700 million, to be 
disbursed in two installments, one in 1994, the other next year. 
  Argentina will also bolster the BCIE capital with $60 
million, as will Venezuela, with a possible contribution of 
$122.5 million. 
  The idea is to turn the BCIE into a stimulator of 
development 
and provide it with resources to combat poverty and promote 
regional plans for sustainable development. 
  The presidents said Spain decided to disburse $100 million 
of 
a $500-million fund earmarked for Central America on the 
occasion of the fifth centennial commemoration last year. This 
disbursement will be used to reinforce a high voltage electric 
interconnection network between the regional countries. The 
Inter-American Development Bank [IDB] will support financing of 
the project with a $350-million loan. 
  The presidents said Spain has put a $380-million fund at the 
disposal of Central America and other countries of the continent 
as a complement to the aid the IDB is offering to Latin America. 
  The area presidents also spotlighted the unity that prevails 
among them.

<F P=106> [Article by unidentified "special" reporters from Cartagena </F>
de Indias, Colombia] 
  [Excerpts] At the closing of the Fourth Ibero-American 
summit of heads of state and government that was held in this 
city, President Juan Carlos Wasmosy on 15 June expressed his 
rejection of the trade embargo on Cuba. Nonetheless, he urged 
Cuban President Fidel Castro to effect a democratic opening in 
his country. [passage omitted] 
  Wasmosy referred to the situation confronting the Cuban 
nation: "We are against blockades, but by the same token we 
request that there be a greater democratic opening in Cuba. 
Resolutions taken in that country will thereby have more 
legitimacy." 
  Another issue discussed by the heads of state and government 
was the "right to life." But no consensus was reached on it in 
order to draft a joint summit declaration. 
  The subject was discussed on 15 June by Argentine President 
Carlos Saul Menem, who in a plenary summit session moved that a 
unified pronouncement condemning abortion be made. This motion 
was supported by Wasmosy. 
  Our head of state said: "We protect the right to life. We 
believe that there is life from the moment an ovum is 
fertilized. Therefore, pursuant to our religious beliefs and 
laws, we deem that abortion is a crime." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias, Colombia -- President Juan 
Carlos Wasmosy on 16 June expressed his desire that the changes 
in Cuba should emerge without any bloodshed. He expressed his 
hope that Fidel Castro, on his own initiative, will begin the 
modernization of the Cuban state. 
  "I hope that day is close, I hope Fidel Castro will 
personally begin this modernization, this change that the whole 
world is expecting in Cuba. Let the change be implemented 
slowly, without trauma and without bloodshed," Wasmosy said. 
  He indicated that when the changes happen, Paraguay will 
open 
its doors to the Cuban people as a whole because the Cuban 
people are dear to us all. He maintained that everything has 
been done to try to bring about more freedom, a greater opening 
in the Caribbean island. He expressed his sadness regarding the 
blockade that surrounds Cuba. "We have asked for a program of 
opening for the Cuban people," Wasmosy said.

  [Text] President Juan Carlos Wasmosy returned last night to 
Asuncion from the Fourth Ibero-American Summit that was held in 
Cartagena [Colombia] between 13 and 15 June. Wasmosy met with 
his Ecuadoran and Chilean colleagues, Sixto Duran Ballen and 
Eduardo Frei, respectively, on 16 May in that city. 
  During his first address, Wasmosy's call for a sea outlet 
for 
our country was warmly received by Frei, who promised his 
government will immediately begin the construction and paving of 
the 60 km stretch of highway that will connect northeast 
Argentina and Antofagasta [Chile] and thus open an outlet to the 
Pacific for our exports. 
  Wasmosy stressed that his government will improve and pave 
the highway that connects Mariscal Estigarribia [Paraguay] with 
Pozo Hondo [Paraguay] through Mision La Paz [Argentina], which 
will make possible the connection with Chile. 
  It must be reported that Wasmosy's appeal for a sea outlet 
with a smoother policy did not receive encouraging answers from 
Argentina or Uruguay. The president indicated that speeches 
have no significance if in practice there is no real 
cooperation. The president questioned the customs tariffs that 
Argentina charges on our exports. 
  He also said he cannot conceive the river waterway without 
the incorporation of the River Plate. 
  During his meeting with Duran Ballen, Wasmosy invited him to 
officially visit our country. The Ecuadoran president will 
visit the country at the end of the year with a trade mission. 
  Wasmosy also met with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria in 
Cartagena's Hilton Hotel. Gaviria later reported that he 
promised his Paraguayan colleague that within the next few days 
he will send a mission of legal experts to advise the executive 
branch on the drafting of a bill for the repression of drug 
trafficking. He gave no more details. 
  Another topic discussed by the two presidents is that 
Paraguay should make its presence felt more at the OAS taking 
into account that Gaviria will in the near future take over as 
secretary general of the organization replacing Joao Baena 
Soares. 
  Ruben Melgarejo Lanzoni, Paraguayan ambassador to the OAS, 
who also participated in the meeting, indicated that Gaviria 
promised a larger participation in the organization's posts to 
our country, including the post of OAS representative to member 
countries. 
  Melgarejo Lanzoni also indicated that he did not reject the 
idea that the Mercosur [Common Market of the South] Treaty could 
be modified to allow the membership of Chile and Bolivia. He 
indicated that Wasmosy and Frei had also discussed the topic. 
  Wasmosy reported that he will thoroughly overhaul the 
foreign 
service "by creating a school of diplomacy," in other words, 
establish a career system that will remain unchanged no matter 
who is in power. "Our foreign policy must be one and one 
alone," he said.

<F P=106> [Interview with OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares by </F>
Carlos Banales Marino, EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO correspondent in 
Washington, D.C.; date not given] 
  [Text] [Banales Marino] What are the differences between 
the OAS you encountered 10 years ago and the OAS you are leaving 
now? 
  [Baena Soares] I am very pleased with the fact that I was 
able to be present at the OAS during a period of reaffirmation 
and modernization of our organization. I am leaving an 
organization that is prominent; able to meet new challenges; has 
been strengthened by member countries' political will; is able 
to react to attacks on democratic processes; and is prepared to 
cope with serious problems involving trade, environment, illegal 
drug abuse, and all those issues currently worrying the modern 
world. All the governments represented at the OAS have been 
elected in free elections and this represents a huge difference 
from the situation 10 years ago. 
  [Banales Marino] Are we entitled to say that the OAS has 
matured as an international organization throughout these 10 
years? 
  [Baena Soares] I believe it has improved. This organization 
was established in 1889. Afterward, our countries met 
periodically until the OAS Charter was voted on in 1948. And 
this may be the date when the OAS was formally established. It 
is not possible to say that an organization established more 
than 100 years ago is not mature. I would prefer to say that 
this was a period of reaffirmation of our organization as a 
mechanism for dialogue among countries in our hemisphere. 
  [Banales Marino] At this moment and with the current OAS 
structure, do you believe the OAS has more mechanisms available 
to improve Latin America's political and social perspectives? 
  [Baena Soares] No doubt. I believe these mechanisms involve 
the three reforms of the OAS Charter and the approval of such a 
new idea as integral development. 
  [Banales Marino] During your tenure as OAS secretary general 
there were a number of crises in Latin America in which the OAS 
became strongly involved. In your opinion, which one was the 
most delicate? 
  [Baena Soares] I believe the entire peace process in Central 
America represented a very significant participation effort by 
our organization. We are involved in various stages of a process 
in Nicaragua, Honduras, and Costa Rica. Understandably, this is 
absolutely necessary from a humanitarian viewpoint--in the first 
place--and considering a country's economic interests, job 
openings, and the use of land. 
  When democracy was under attack, we created a favorable 
atmosphere with our participation, but I am aware of the fact 
that the decisions to restore democracy are made by the people. 
It is not the OAS but the people who guarantee democracy. The 
inter-American community, through the OAS, may actually 
cooperate, assist, and create a favorable atmosphere. In Haiti, 
we still have problems. I am used to saying that the mere fact 
that there still are problems is something essential because, if 
you look back, 15 years ago there were people like Duvalier and 
Generals Nanfir and Avril. There was a different reaction, one 
of approval. Now there is one of rejection. Not a single 
American country has recognized the de facto authorities in 
three years. Moreover, there has always been an adverse 
reaction, seeking a solution. What are the roots, the profound 
reasons for this crisis? 
  The links between entrepreneurs and the military are at the 
root of the crisis because the entrepreneurs never accepted the 
elections, never accepted the presence of President Aristide. 
And as long as we do not tackle the cause of an illness, it 
cannot be cured. 
  [Banales Marino] Do you believe the embargo on Haiti, the 
way 
it is currently being implemented, represents a final solution? 
  [Baena Soares] As long as some entrepreneurs are allowed to 
travel abroad, do business, and carry out transactions with 
their foreign accounts, we will be doing something that does not 
directly affect the people responsible. Therefore, I am saying 
that not all our organization's and its member countries' 
resources have been exhausted. Attempts already have been made 
to achieve an agreement. We already have four agreements signed. 
These agreements have not been respected at either the OAS or 
the United Nations. Therefore, solutions may not be invented. In 
my opinion, a military intervention does not represent a 
solution. We must not forget that in the past Haiti was occupied 
for 19 years. Duvalier's period, and not democracy, followed 
this occupation. The consequences of the Duvalier period still 
can be seen. 
  [Banales Marino] What about Cuba? 
  [Baena Soares] Cuba is a country that belongs to this 
hemisphere. The OAS is this hemisphere's international 
organization that may not ignore any situation prevailing in 
this hemisphere. We currently are experiencing many changes in 
the international system. There are transformations that must be 
taken into account. All this represents a clue for discussion of 
this issue. I cannot anticipate the stances to be taken by the 
governments, but I can actually point out that it is necessary 
to hold this discussion. This issue has not been included on the 
OAS General Assembly's agenda but it obviously is present.

<F P=106> ["Text" of address by Bolivian Foreign Minister Antonio </F>
Aranibar Quiroga to the 24th OAS General Assembly in Belem do 
Para, Brasil -- released by the Bolivian Foreign Ministry 
Diplomatic Information General Directorate in La Paz on 8 June] 
  [Text] "Bolivia is immensely grateful to the Inter-American 
community for its support over our just claim to a sea outlet as 
expressed in 11 resolutions issued by the OAS General Assembly. 
This support constitutes an OAS political and diplomatic legacy 
toward our most important international dispute, which is yet 
unresolved and which undermines our morale and our economic 
development. The sea is an essential part of Bolivia's material 
and spiritual integrity. We need a solution to this problem, 
and we are obliged to find it. 
  "The community of the Americas has unequivocally recognized 
the need for the two involved countries to achieve a peaceful 
and friendly solution to the landlocked situation Bolivia has 
endured since it lost its sea coast during the Pacific War. 
This negotiation at the OAS level does not conflict with 
bilateral or trilateral discussions on this issue, nor with 
inevitable direct negotiations on the maritime issue. On the 
contrary, they are in line with the friendly spirit that must 
reign in hemispheric relations. It is only normal for nations 
of the Americas to be concerned and to urge those countries 
involved in unresolved conflicts to find friendly solutions. 
  "Was it not the support of the countries of the Americas 
which paved the way for achieving the Torrijos-Carter agreements 
through which Panama regained its sovereignty over the Panama 
Canal? Was it not the support of the international community 
which led to peace between Palestine and Israel? Was it not the 
support of the international community which helped to 
definitely eradicate apartheid in South Africa? 
  "I believe we are all obliged to build a peaceful, friendly, 
and secure region for our children. 
  "Although the future seems bright, both Chile and Bolivia 
are 
determined to establish conditions and measures of mutual trust 
and tolerance, and despite renewed appeals by the OAS General 
Assembly, it is obvious that the governments directly involved 
have been unable to achieve a suitable satisfactory solution. 
  "The international scenario has witnessed changes and 
advancements at the end of this century which seemed utopian a 
few years back. Ideological and racial barriers, and conflicts 
between nations are giving way to agreements that honor justice, 
solidarity, and international peace. 
  "In view of this why should countries tied by a common 
heritage be unable to achieve agreements that will restore 
Bolivia's original status as a Pacific rim country, and 
definitely heal old wounds? 
  "There is no legal argument in the world that can override 
the deep feeling of a nation that tells our governments to end 
their defensive and negative positions, and formal speeches for 
the sake of creative measures that will allow the establishment 
of ethical international relations. 
  "We believe in integration and in the complementation of 
countries with common interests that are able to ban chauvinism 
and misunderstandings for the sake of uniting their efforts and 
overcoming the challenges of a future filled with uncertainties, 
in which the one single enemy is the poverty of our countries. 
  "Latin America is living in an era of democracy and cohesive 
cooperation that demands a consensus. A new mentality of trust 
and credibility is taking hold in the region. A mentality in 
which neighbors do not look upon each other as potential 
antagonists. One in which the creative force of our countries 
is surging. One in which there is a clear awareness that the 
countries of the region are one family and that they must unite 
under the new breezes sweeping through contemporary history. 
  "We must support each other, without impositions or 
exclusions. We must engage in common undertakings, encourage our 
reciprocal knowledge, promote the rapprochement of our 
societies, strengthen our cultural ties, and tear down the 
fences of misunderstanding, prejudice, dogmas, and 
insensitivity. This is definitely the state of mind with which 
we must welcome the next century. 
  "Not so long ago, as a result of the new mentality upheld by 
their respective administrations, and by overcoming Chaco War 
grievances, Paraguay and Bolivia were able to achieve a 
long-sought historic rapprochement. Current ties and friendly 
relations bind today the two countries which optimistically seek 
excellent rewards from trade, road interconnections, the 
Paraguay-Parana waterway, the Pilcomayo river, and other 
similarly important projects. Bolivian-Paraguayan ties 
constitute a model for Latin America and an example that should 
be followed. 
  "For the good of the Latin American community, the same is 
occurring among other countries in the region where neighboring 
countries which, until recently were faced with what seemed 
insurmountable rivalries, have resolved long-standing border 
problems in an exemplary manner, achieving an excellent level of 
ties. 
  "Recent developments allow us to view with prudent optimism 
Bolivian-Chilean ties. Meetings between high-ranking government 
officials have been cordial. During President Gonzalo Sanchez 
de Lozada's trip to Santiago, Chile, on the occasion of the Rio 
Group presidential summit, several meetings were held between 
the Bolivian and Chilean presidents. The preponderant role the 
Catholic Churches of Chile and of Bolivia have played in this 
process is also worthy of mentioning. It is clear, however, 
that despite all auspicious circumstances that have been 
discussed, Bolivia continues to suffer the consequences of its 
landlocked situation. This is undoubtedly one of the most clear 
obstacles in the path of full integration in the Americas. 
  "I am certain that all the countries represented here hope 
to 
see noble gestures from the countries involved and, by the next 
OAS General Assembly, bear witness to a solution to this issue. 
  "The challenge facing the new administrations of Bolivia and 
Chile today is to build together a future of peace and 
cooperation. There is no better inspiration to achieve this goal 
than the conviction expressed by the great Chilean Poet Vicente 
Huidobro who said: `As a Chilean and as a human being, I believe 
and assert that we must negotiate with Bolivia as soon as 
possible and that the two countries should and must resolve the 
serious issue involving Bolivia's outlet to the sea fraternally 
and with generosity.'"

  [Text] Iquique (Chile), 16 Jun (EFE) -- The need to fight 
against drug trafficking and consumption and the replacement of 
coca plantations in Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru through 
international aid are the proposals the Latin American 
Parliament (Parlatino) began to debate today, 16 June. 
  The meeting began today in the Chilean port of Iquique, 
1,857 
km north of Santiago, and will end tomorrow, 17 June, with the 
release of conclusions on subjects such as drug trafficking, the 
foreign debt, energy and mines, economic matters, and 
international law. 
  Bolivian Deputy Guido Camacho, president of the 
Antinarcotics 
Defense Commission [Comision de Defensa en la Lucha Contra el 
Narcotrafico], told EFE that the international community must 
participate in coca replacement policies in Colombia, Peru, and 
Bolivia, given that this agricultural product generates revenues 
in those countries. 
  He said there is the legal consumption of coca, especially 
by 
Bolivian and Peruvian peasants as part of their daily diet. 
  The Parlatino members pointed out that excess coca goes for 
the production of cocaine, which leads to drug trafficking. 
  Camacho added that measures must be adopted to prevent this 
from happening. Enforcement policies must be reinforced with 
preventive measures, related to the need to replace the coca 
plantations with alternative crops. 
  This must be done within a plan to improve highway 
infrastructure and other measures to pave the way for a more 
adequate trade of agricultural products, Deputy Camacho said. 
  He added that the proposal to legalize the use of cocaine in 
Colombia will be discussed at the meetings to be held on Friday. 
  Among the proposals is one submitted by Chile demanding 
punishment for drug traffickers and also for consumers. 
  When asked about the validity of the conclusions released by 
the Parlatino for the governments, the Bolivian deputy explained 
that the resolutions will approved by consensus of the Parlatino 
members who will then take these ideas to the congresses of 
their respective countries to turn them into laws.

<F P=106> [Remarks by President Fidel Castro during news conference </F>
with domestic correspondents following the fourth Ibero-American 
summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, on 16 June; from the 
"Doing Radio" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] The issues that ought to be discussed at the Miami 
summit include: the defense of sovereignty; the principle of 
nonintervention in Latin American affairs; and the abandonment 
of pretexts used to meddle more and more in domestic affairs, 
such as the drug trafficking problem. The United States should 
not use this as an excuse to try to limit the sovereignty of 
Latin American countries and turn their armies into police 
forces. There are many political and economic issues. 
  I was thinking that if it is true that they -- as they say 
-- 
want to establish a more mature relationship and withdraw their 
bases from Latin America, they must not forget to close the 
Guantanamo base. They must fulfill their agreements and 
withdraw forces from Panama and any other country. Security, 
political, and economic problems ought to be discussed at that 
summit. There are many things. 
  If they want the views of the nongovernmental organizations, 
they ought to ask everyone's opinion -- indigenous people, 
women, unions, civilian organizations, etc. -- without 
exclusions. There is a gamut of things to discuss with the 
United States. I advocate the Latin American peoples' 
discussion of those issues at that notorious Miami summit. It 
will be a summit of Latin American and Caribbean countries. I 
know courageous politicians. I have met them at these summits. 
I have met them in the Caribbean, worthy and capable people. 
  We hope these issues will be brought up to challenge the 
slogans. As I said, we have lived from decade to decade, from 
slogan to slogan, from century to century, lie after lie. Every 
new administration comes up with something new...[pauses] the 
Alliance for Progress, the Initiative for the Americas. Every 
president invents a new catch phrase for the day. They should 
not allow this to become another catch phrase for the day. I am 
glad that the summits we have held, free from the intervention 
of third parties and without having to get anyone's permission, 
have forced them to convene the Miami summit. 
  Of course, they could have selected a different city. Miami 
has already been chosen. They did not bother to hide the fact 
that this is a political ploy, a U.S. domestic policy ploy. 
They have returned to their loathsome exclusions, which reflect 
deep down -- I say it again -- political cowardice, lack of 
courage to face the debate, and lack of courage to discuss the 
truth. They do not want to catch sight of anything, like my 
uniform or guayabera. [laughter]

<F P=106> [From the "Morning Information Review" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Cuban President Fidel Castro returned to Havana from 
Cartagena de Indias where he participated in the Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit. The last activities by the Cuban chief 
of state were separate meetings with Colombian groups that 
support Cuba and with Colombian businessmen. The Cuban 
President reiterated in Cartagena de Indias that the importance 
of the Ibero-American summits stems basically from the fact that 
it is the first time the Latin American countries meet without 
anyone convoking them. 
  At a meeting with representatives of Colombian organizations 
that support Cuba, Castro referred to the progress and 
perspectives of Latin American integration and the so-called 
Summit of the Americas, convoked by the United States for later 
this year. He called the presence of Cuba in the Ibero-American 
summits exceptional because for the first time it is not 
excluded. In this regard, he said the support of Mexico, which 
hosted the first summit, and the support of other friendly 
countries had a lot to do with Cuba's presence at the summit. 
  The Cuban president noted that the summits have contributed 
to combating Cuba's isolation, to creating awareness of the 
blockade it has endured, to giving a lesson to the United 
States, to increasing Cuba's relations with many countries, and 
to enhancing rapprochement among Latin American countries. 
Fidel Castro said that currently, there does not exist a true 
integration conscience in Latin America, but that the summits 
are contributing to this. He said the main obstacle is the 
United States, which is attempting to prevent Latin America from 
being more independent. 
  The Cuban chief of state said the Ibero-American summits are 
so important that the northern enemy was envious and invented 
another summit, precisely in Miami, which it wants to turn into 
the capital of Latin America. He reiterated, nonetheless, that 
Cuba is not opposed to that summit, despite the fact that he 
believes Cuba's exclusion is cowardice. He explained this is 
because U.S. Government leaders are afraid of words, ideas, and 
truths, which denotes political weakness. Castro noted that he 
is not opposed to the summit in Miami because he hopes that the 
Latin American countries there will firmly defend the interests 
of the region.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with President Fidel Castro by Radio </F>
Cadena Nacional, RCN, journalist Antonio Caballero in Cartagena 
de Indias, Colombia, on 16 June -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Caballero] [Words indistinct] Radio Cadena Nacional 
[RCN] of Colombia. Good morning. 
  [Castro] Good morning and thank you. 
  [Caballero] Well, let us begin at the beginning, as the 
saying goes. Was it a rhetorical summit again, or did it include 
important, substantial things to show not only to Latin America 
but also to the world, Mr. President? 
  [Castro] All the summits are full of rhetoric, wherever they 
are held, especially this type of summit, right? They include 
outstanding figures from many places. They are not the everyday 
type of meeting such as those held in Europe. First of all, each 
summit is an event eagerly awaited by political leaders from the 
participating countries. This summit also has historical 
significance in that it is the first time Latin Americans met on 
our own. In the past, we met only when we were summoned by the 
United States. This phase began in Guadalajara, and this is the 
fourth summit. 
  I sincerely believe it represents a very important event 
inasmuch as heads of state met to discuss various topics. It has 
played an important role in the rapprochement between countries 
and country leaders. A rapprochement between countries cannot 
occur if there is no rapprochement between country leaders. All 
kinds of initiatives, practical initiatives, have been submitted 
-- courses, cooperation, funds for specific purposes to benefit 
communities, for example, a fund to support the Indian 
population. 
  In other words, this type of specific thing has been 
approved 
but, above all, these summits are important for the future and 
represent an effort toward the integration of the Latin American 
peoples: economic integration, first of all, political 
rapprochement, and what will perhaps be political integration of 
Latin American countries in the future. People get to know one 
another through these summits; bilateral rapprochement has been 
sponsored through these summits; regional organizations like the 
Latin American Integration Association, the Southern Cone Common 
Market, the Andean Pact, and the Latin American Economic System 
have acquired importance and strength through these summits. I 
notice that progress has been achieved so these summits project 
themselves toward the future; they have become 
institutionalized, and I believe they will truly become an 
important factor in what has been so much discussed, the Latin 
American integration progress. 
  [Caballero] Mr. President, Cuba is always a mandatory topic 
at these summits -- beginning with the one in Guadalajara and 
continuing with this one. Let us say it is one of the important 
topics. Some of your counterparts, fellow presidents from 
various countries -- the presidents of Peru and Argentina, for 
example -- disagree with your version, with your concept of 
democracy. They attack you, and they continue to insist on the 
need to democratize Cuba. 
  [Castro] Well, those concepts are completely different and, 
in general, are mostly ignorant of things in Cuba. For example, 
they ignore that we have a constitution that was discussed with 
all the people and that it was approved by more than 95 percent 
of the country's citizens. It was our socialist Constitution 
with all its government and representation mechanisms. That 
Constitution functioned until 1975 [as heard]. Two years ago, we 
made some modifications to the Constitution, to perfect it. Many 
people believe there is not even a Constitution in Cuba. 
  [Caballero] Does the criticism from your counterparts bother 
you? 
  [Castro] No, man. I would say we are somewhat used to this. 
Rather than discuss the criticism from my counterparts -- we can 
talk about that later -- I would discuss the ignorance in which 
many live regarding what happens in Cuba. They do not know there 
are elections in Cuba and that the people's representatives are 
elected by the people. Although no one knows about this system, 
in my opinion, it is among the most modern and allows for the 
greatest participation of the people because the party is not 
the one that chooses the candidates; it is the citizens in each 
district. They appoint those who will choose the candidates. It 
is like having 1,000 parties because any district can propose 
any citizen, discuss his merits and virtues in assemblies, and 
elect him. 
  Those citizens later become candidates and they do it with 
the participation of mass organizations and representatives of 
the workers, the peasants, the students, women, and the 
Committees for the Defense of the Revolution. The mass 
organizations are composed of commissions that discuss and 
submit lists of candidates to delegates who are directly elected 
by the people in the neighborhoods, and the party does not 
intervene in that or decide that; so there is enormous freedom, 
more than any system known to date. Candidates must get over 50 
percent of the votes. 
  The National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP] is 
comprised this way. The ANPP is the one that elects the 
executive branch. In other words, the ANPP is the highest 
organization in the state and everyone is accountable to the 
ANPP. Candidates may be elected and they may be reelected, as a 
norm, as a principle. They must systematically submit reports to 
their voters. All this is unknown. If Cuba had no Constitution, 
there would be no state of law. Everyone's rights and duties are 
well defined. 
  We do not have a presidential government. You should analyze 
the Cuban president's authority. You will realize he has less 
than any president in Latin America. He does not even have the 
authority to appoint ministers. Ministers must be appointed by 
the Council of State. The Council of State is an institution 
elected by the ANPP for the periods when it is in recess. All 
the ministerial posts and other important posts, the posts of 
ambassadors, must be discussed by the Council of State before 
they are appointed, or before they are dismissed. I can assure 
you that the authority of the president of the Republic is 
minimal in our country. There is truly consensual leadership. 
That is why I am not president of the Republic; I am president 
of the Council of State. 
  [Caballero] Mr. President, regarding your last speech about 
your concept of democracy, which I respect, you will obviously 
ratify that concept and continue to implement it in Cuba. 
  [Castro] Of course. We are satisfied and our people are 
satisfied with the system we have established. I believe we do 
not [words indistinct]. I am criticized when I use a uniform, 
yet others want to make institutions uniform, make them exactly 
alike. Nevertheless, there is a great diversity of government 
institutions in the world. 
  [Caballero] By the way, how did you feel with a guayabera, 
showing up wearing a guayabera? 
  [Castro] I adapted quickly. All my life I have felt normal, 
calm, and satisfied to wear the same clothes I wore over 35 
years ago when I was in the mountains. Many asked why I wore an 
uniform. I said: Because it is more comfortable and economical. 
I do not have to follow fashions; and I got so used to the 
uniform that I took it off only when I went to sleep. It is a 
campaign uniform, without adornment, without many attributes. It 
is as simple as can be. Therefore.. [pauses] we have another 
uniform, a formal uniform, but it is also very simple -- pants, 
coat, and tie -- and the rank insignia. I do not have many. I 
have the insignia of a commander. It is the rank I had when I 
landed with the Granma. It is the only rank I have had. I am the 
only one who has not been promoted. The only thing is that I was 
called commander in chief -- that is how I always signed -- and 
the title of commander in chief stuck. I always used the 
uniform. Well, when I go to the beach to swim, fish, or dive, I 
have to don shorts. That is the only time I do not wear a 
uniform. 
  [Caballero] Do you still swim a lot? 
  [Castro] Well, I swim.... 
  [Caballero, interrupting] It is said you swim a lot. How 
many 
km do you swim nowadays? 
  [Castro, chuckling] Well, sometimes I swim more; sometimes I 
swim less -- but I do it somewhat offshore. 
  [Caballero] How many km, more or less? 
  [Castro] A maximum of... [pauses] that was in 1979, on my 
birthday, on the victim -- no, not victim, on the eve of the 
sixth summit. That time I swam slowly, not kicking like a frog, 
and I used a snorkel. Sometimes I used the backstroke; sometimes 
I used the breast stroke. I swam for eight hours -- but that was 
in 1979. I have not dared repeat the effort since then, but I 
can swim -- at a moderate pace, naturally -- three or four km. I 
always swim farther offshore. I go to a buoy or a lighthouse. I 
cannot adapt to the beaches. I have done this for many years, 
for over 30 years. 
  [Caballero] Mr. President, going back to the issue of Cuba, 
what will happen with these people who entered the Belgian 
Embassy, the German Embassy, and the Chilean Consulate? 
  [Castro] This is sponsored from abroad. This type of 
incident 
can be used to generate publicity, to create a scandal. The main 
reason, however, is that these people want to immigrate. It is 
not a political problem but an immigration problem, a problem of 
economic immigration or of people who have relatives abroad who 
cannot get a U.S. visa. They do this to sponsor... [pauses] They 
may do this for different reasons, but, in my opinion, one of 
its main effects and one of its main goals is to sponsor illegal 
departures from the country and to sponsor incidents that give 
them political dividends. I want you to know that anyone who 
wants to leave our country may leave. Anyone of legal age can 
visit his relatives and return to the country. We are much more 
open about arrivals and departures to and from the country. We 
maintained certain restrictions for a long time, given U.S. 
plans, sabotage, and CIA activities. We have been quite open 
about immigration, however, as a rule, since the beginning of 
the revolution. We based ourselves on the principle that free 
men and women must voluntarily sustain socialism. We never 
prevented those who did not want socialism and who wanted to 
immigrate to another country from doing so. There were 
restrictions, however, more or less, until a number of years 
ago. We adopted the policy of allowing all those who wanted to 
leave to do so. 
  Nevertheless, will they not be granted political asylum, 
which is what they requested? 
  [Castro] No, because neither the Belgian Embassy nor the 
other European embassy is registered. There is no political 
asylum. Political asylum exists in Latin America and in Latin 
American embassies. They have the right to grant political 
asylum. They are the ones who decide what must be done. Anyone, 
however, who enters any embassy by force... [pauses] If the 
embassy has the right to grant political asylum, it will decide 
itself whether to order them to leave or to grant them asylum. 
They, however, do not want to do that because the people who 
show up there are not political refugees. This is not a matter 
of persecuted people seeking political asylum. These people want 
to immigrate. If they are not granted a visa through normal 
channels, they enter by force and create a scandal to pressure 
them into granting visas. We have established a principle in 
light of this: We give anyone in the country the right to leave; 
only those who enter an embassy by force will not receive 
permission to leave, regardless of the circumstances. Therefore, 
whoever enters an embassy by force... [pauses] We authorize him 
to leave, we adopt no measures against him, and we grant him 
full guarantees, but we also guarantee we will not give him a 
visa to leave -- if he is ever granted a visa -- because we must 
adopt some kind of measure to stop this and to avoid having to 
use violence and force. While we are dutybound to protect the 
embassies, we cannot use excessive violence. Instead, they are 
protected by the principle that whoever enters by force loses 
his right to leave the country. There would be no way to protect 
the embassies if we did not adopt that measure. 
  People in Cuba, Santo Domingo, and many other countries must 
leave and immigrate. They go to Mexico. Millions of Mexicans 
somehow manage to overcome the gigantic wall that the United 
States has built between Mexico and [word indistinct]. The 
people of Santo Domingo leave through many routes, but they are 
not given a permit if they enter the United States illegally. 
They are not automatically given a residence permit. The only 
citizens in the world who have the right to enter the United 
States, by any route, whoever they may be, are the Cubans. They 
are automatically given a residence permit. The only citizens 
who are given this are the Cubans. 
  That is a measure adopted at the time when more hate and 
hostility was felt against us. No Colombian could arrive on U.S. 
shores aboard a boat and immediately be granted asylum. No 
Dominican, Haitian, Mexican, no one from any Latin American 
country. Naturally, this encourages illegal departures [words 
indistinct] because, as soon as they arrive, they become 
publicity material and are received as heroes. That is the truth 
of the story about these illegal departures and the problems at 
the embassies. 
  [Caballero] Now that you mention the United States, do you 
believe President Clinton has opened the door a bit? Do you 
think he could meet with Commander Castro, with President 
Castro, and settle all this a bit? 
  [Castro] Nothing has been really said about this, and 
Clinton 
has not given the slightest indication that he is willing to 
follow that line and meet me. Quite the contrary, Clinton is 
thinking primarily about a second term. Since Florida is the 
fourth most important state in the union and Bush and Reagan 
campaigned there a lot, it is considered a republican state with 
the support of the immigrant community there. They do not know 
that a large part, an increasing part of that immigrant 
community opposes the blockade and the aggressive policy against 
Cuba. A minority group there, however, has power because they 
are the powerful; they have the money; they have the media; they 
exert pressure and lobby against Congress and against the 
administration. 
  Therefore, since Clinton wants to win the next election, he 
wants to curry favor with those people to get their votes and 
their (?advice). The Cuban issue has become a U.S. domestic 
policy issue, even though the number of Cubans who immigrated 
and who advocate an improvement of relations with Cuba has 
increased, is big, and is important now. Something else is also 
growing in the United States, namely the opinion of 
intellectuals, academicians, people in general, and businessmen 
who consider the blockade unjustified and obsolete. That 
movement is growing even in the United Nations. The United 
States is scandalously isolated every time the blockade issue is 
discussed, and the vast majority of countries is manifestly 
opposed to the blockade against Cuba. 
  [Caballero] Part of the summit's document mentions this. A 
paragraph of the document. 
  [Castro] A paragraph of the document is dedicated to the 
issue of the blockade against Cuba. 
  [Caballero] Mr. President, do you believe that when 
President 
Cesar Gaviria goes to the OAS... [pauses] First of all, what is 
your reaction to President Gaviria's appointment? Do you think 
that once the Colombian president becomes OAS secretary general, 
the issue of Cuba will be brought up? 
  [Castro] This is a complex issue. First of all, we support 
Gaviria's appointment. We were happy that a person like him, 
with his capabilities, a well-known person, an experienced 
person, was appointed to the OAS. We cannot discuss his ideas 
because he has yet to assume the post. I imagine he will assume 
his post, reflect, and possibly adopt an initiative in that 
regard, but we are not exerting pressure in favor of this. Since 
we have been out of the OAS for such a long time, we see this 
issue of the OAS calmly; we do not see it as a priority issue 
for us. The priority is the struggle against the blockade. 
  The blockade should end; it is unfair, doubly unfair, 
doubly criminal at a time when the socialist bloc has 
disappeared, when the Soviet Union has disappeared, and when the 
Cold War is over. There was never justification for the 
blockade, much less at a time like this when it is much more 
harmful because we lost that point of support -- meaning trade 
with the USSR and the socialist countries, the credits, the 
technology. Eighty percent of our trade was carried out with the 
socialist bloc; we received a tremendous blow. The blockade is 
causing us much more damage than it did when normal conditions 
existed concerning Cuba's relations with the USSR and the 
socialist bloc. Therefore, that blockade has no justification 
and our number-one priority is the struggle against that 
blockade. 
  [Caballero] Mr. President, speaking of bilateral issues, I 
would like to ask you something. When you previously came for a 
visit to Cartagena, many politicians here stated their views to 
RCN. They criticized you because you did not condemn the armed 
struggle that unfortunately continues in our country. 
  [Castro] As a rule, I do not meddle in the internal affairs 
of other countries. We should not meddle, and that is why we 
have not adopted policies or issued statements in connection 
with internal affairs. We are determined to follow that 
guideline regardless of criticism because we believe our 
position is fair. Therefore, it is a problem that must be solved 
by each country. Those are political problems that should be 
solved by each country. 
  [Caballero] In fact, President Castro, one of the candidates 
with the best chance of winning on Sunday, Andres Pastrana, said 
it will be necessary to revise relations with you because he 
does not think they should exist. 
  [Castro] I believe it would be a mistake to recant 
concerning 
relations that have been developed between the Cuban and 
Colombian people and Governments. I think that whoever wins in 
the elections should follow that guideline because we have 
things in common, such as the summit; we have other issues of 
common interest; we cooperate within the United Nations; and we 
have also played an important, active role concerning Colombia's 
election for hosting the next nonaligned countries' summit. That 
is an extremely important step that involves not only some Latin 
American countries, but also most of the African countries and 
almost all of the Third World countries, with which we have 
excellent relations. 
  It would not be possible to suddenly adopt a hostile policy 
toward Cuba, from an important post within the nonaligned 
countries' movement because it would be very detrimental to the 
movement. We are founding members of the movement; we have a 
long history within the movement; and we have a large number of 
friends. We suppose they would not appreciate any hostility 
toward Cuba or any decision to recant, in the relations between 
Cuba and Colombia; so I hope whoever becomes president will bear 
in mind all those factors and continue to work in favor of 
relations that are going along excellently. 
  Moreover, we have no right to meddle in the elections or 
support any party because, well, the people should decide which 
candidate should be elected, which candidate should be given 
their vote of confidence. We hope this does not imply a change 
in strategic issues because it would be tantamount to turning 
back the wheels of history. 
  [Caballero] Mr. President, this thing they say... [pauses] 
For example, Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle and 
Argentine President Carlos Menem called you quote, a dinosaur, 
and your strategy dinosaurian, unquote. What is your opinion? 
  [Castro -- laughs] They told me that. Generally, when they 
speak with me, they do it nicely, especially Menem. In this 
meeting, we talked a lot; we discussed many topics in which we 
have common interests. I thought he was very nice. They have 
their own political ideas and, so far as epithets are concerned, 
everyone has heard -- even I have heard -- about the dinosaur of 
capitalism. [laughs] I would say this also applies to 
liberalism. I do not believe it solves the world's problems. I 
am not a neoliberal. I believe in the future; I believe in 
changes in the future; I believe in a more noble, generous, 
supportive, egalitarian world. 
  I said I became a socialist before I read Karl Marx. I was 
what you would call a utopic socialist. Later, when I read Marx, 
I had my mind prepared to be conquered by a scientific concept 
of history, a scientific economic concept. The idea about an 
egalitarian, just society awoke my sympathies. That attracted me 
the most. I was attracted by Marx's idea, the principle that the 
state should disappear one day. I say true democracy cannot 
exist where there is no equality, where there is no brotherhood, 
where some people are immensely rich and others are immensely 
poor. The sine qua non condition of true democracy should be 
equality and brotherhood among men, and equal opportunities. 
  I believe the best formula ever invented -- even if no one 
has been able to implement it yet, even if the world has yet to 
go in that direction -- is the formula in which each human being 
works according to his capabilities and receives according to 
his needs. That is the most noble thing ever written. In fact, 
that is what most closely resembles the Christian sermons. I say 
that one cannot talk about democracy when there is a beggar 
beside a millionaire. Equality is essential. Theoreticians of 
the liberal, democratic doctrines stated three principles for 
their famous French Revolution -- liberty, equality, and 
fraternity. 
  You do not see this prevail in the world. I, however, see 
that the masses are becoming increasingly aware of social 
justice, equality, and democracy. Democracy has gone through 
various phases. The first was the Greek democracy. It was a 
democracy in which a few people had all the rights and the rest 
had no rights. Then there is the case of Athens, which was 
considered a model of democracy even though there were 30,000 
free citizens and 70,000 slaves. I think the democracy of Athens 
still prevails in some countries of the Third World, in Latin 
America -- a vast majority of extremely poor people and a small 
minority of rich people. Just imagine, in Latin America.... 
  [Caballero, interupting] Excuse me a moment. I must [words 
indistinct]. 
  [Castro] Just imagine.... 
  [Caballero, interrupting] Mr. President, we were talking 
about Athens. 
  [Castro] We were talking about Athens. I was telling you 
there were 30,000 free citizens and 70,000 slaves. It was a 
model democracy. Democracy has achieved progress throughout 
history, in many countries. There is no slavery, at least a form 
of slavery, because there is also actual slavery. For example, I 
said there are republics in Latin America where it seems they 
still have Athens' democracy, a vast majority of extremely poor 
people... [pauses] There are 270 million poor people in this 
hemisphere and our Latin American region is the region of the 
world with the worst distribution of land. It is the world's 
region with the worst distribution of income, to such an extreme 
that 40 percent of the poorest people have 10 percent of the 
income and 20 percent of the rich have up to 60 percent of the 
income. There is no other region in the world with these vast 
economic and social differences within one society. That is why 
all these obstacles must be overcome before we can talk about 
full democracy. Millions die, approximately 1 million children 
under the age of 15 die when they could survive. It is truly a 
slaughter [words indistinct]. When that reality exists and 
prevails, we cannot talk about full democracy. 
  [Caballero] Mr. President, to conclude the exclusive 
interview you have so kindly granted to RCN, it is being said 
that you are sick, that you are tired. Are you tired? Do you 
feel tired of power? 
  [Castro] I do not have the energy I had when I was 20, 22, 
or 
26, like the first time I went to Colombia and the great 
rebellion broke out in Santa Fe de Bogota. I was a young student 
and was always with the students, so I also became involved. I 
had more energy then -- even at 30, 40, or 50 -- than I do now. 
But I still have some energy, enough to let me work 15, 16, or 
17 hours sometimes. This does not mean I work like that every 
day. Fortunately, work is very well distributed in our country 
and there are many new people, many young people, with whom we 
share the work. This allows me to adjust my activities to suit 
the energy level that I have at my age. Nevertheless, I can 
attend a summit like this. I can work the number of hours I 
worked yesterday, beginning very early and ending at 0200. 
Yesterday, we worked 12... [pauses] 14... [pauses] It was 19 
hours. 
  [Caballero] Fidel will be.... 
  [Castro, interrupting] I slept three days... [pauses] three 
hours the first day; five hours the second day -- I got even; 
two and one half hours last night. The rest of the time has been 
spent on commitments and activities. 
  [Caballero] This means Fidel will be around for a long time. 
  [Castro] Well, I hope Fidel is around for a long time, but 
not Fidel with the same amount of work, the same 
responsibilities and obligations. They should give me a chance 
to.... 
  [Caballero -- interrupting] Vacations? 
  [Fidel] Vacations. A long vacation. I should be given the 
opportunity to retire at an appropriate time. This should not 
happen during difficult times, for anyone who pulls back during 
difficult times looks like a deserter. I am afraid of looking 
like a deserter. 
  [Caballero] Where would you like to rest? 
  [Castro] Well, I would very much like to read, to have free 
time to read and chat. 
  [Caballero] Always in Cuba? 
  [Castro] Always in Cuba. 
  [Caballero] Until you die. 
  [Castro] Until I die. I would like the hole to be dug in a 
small plot of land there and to be able to rest there, the 
eternal rest which few people desire but which nature has 
imposed on us all. 
  [Caballero] Mr. President, you have been very kind. Thank 
you 
again on behalf of RCN of Colombia. 
  [Castro] It was a pleasure for me to answer your questions. 
  [Caballero] You are very kind. Good-bye.

<F P=106> [From the "NTV" newscast; passages within quotation marks </F>
recorded] 
  [Text] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro returned to Havana 
after completing his activities in Cartagena, Colombia, during 
the Fourth Ibero-American Summit. Just hours before his 
departure, Fidel commented to journalists who were covering the 
summit on his impressions of the event. 
  [Reporter] "Commander, Cuba has been present at the four 
summits. What has Cuba's contribution been in these summits and 
how have these summits benefited Cuba?" 
  [Castro] "Well, I would say that Cuba has made a 
contribution 
with its very presence. Its presence there is something that is 
exceptional, new, and unprecedented. For the first time, there 
was no exclusion. Mexico had much to do with that as well as our 
other important Latin American friends. Therefore, Cuba's 
presence gives the summit more seriousness and dignity because 
the cowardly exclusion is no longer committed." 
  Fidel's last hours in Cartagena were marked by an emotional 
encounter with Colombian solidarity groups, which motivated 
comments by the Cuban president on continental integration. 
  [Castro] "I would also say that men and women like you 
around 
the world are going to destroy the walls of that gigantic 
Jericho that tries to defeat and crush Cuba and the Cuban 
Revolution, and that tries to crush the brotherhood and union 
among all our peoples."

<F P=106> [News conference by Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina with </F>
unidentified domestic correspondents in Cartagena de Indias, 
Colombia; date not given; from the "Exclusive" newscast; first 
paragraph announcer-read introduction -- recorded] 
  [Text] Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina has told Cuban 
correspondents at the fourth Ibero-American summit that Cuba 
believes that it is most important for the summit to maintain 
unity, validity, and continuity. Robaina also stressed the 
importance of the summit and contacts with other Ibero-American 
delegations: 
  [Robaina] We have highly diverse views, as President Fidel 
clearly explained last night. We have no problem with 
discussing democracy and human rights. Cuba has much to say 
about democracy and human rights. There are many points of 
view. If this is discussed at a closed door meeting, we will 
make our point at a closed door meeting no matter the subject. 
Cuba has its own opinions and views. 
  [Correspondent] Yet, that discussion has wasted time that 
could have been spent on the summit's main issues. 
  [Robaina] It is not a matter of wasting time that could have 
been spent on other issues. Actually, an overloaded agenda 
could be wasting the time that could be spent on other issues. 
In that sense, the summit has a broader agenda. 
  No other summit matches this one. Just as we make an effort 
to [word indistinct] Fidel's contacts with different presidents 
-- such as the presidents of El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, 
Spain, Colombia, and Bolivia -- as well as the other presidents 
who are also in the process of bilateral discussions. The 
foreign ministries' technical teams, as well as the foreign 
ministers, are working hard. 
  The first two sections of the final draft of the final 
document were completed recently. This request, which it now 
seems will not be necessary to include, is currently the only 
component of this draft. The document is expected to be 
approved this afternoon. 
  When so many presidents gather for such an important 
meeting, 
it is often the case that we do not have enough time to get to 
everything. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, do you think the paragraph on 
the U.S. blockade against Cuba that was included in the final 
document will be altered during the afternoon session? 
  [Robaina] I do not want to get ahead of myself. That 
paragraph has already gone through many processes. I can say 
that it is one paragraph that was approved with the least 
resistance. That paragraph already exceeds what was 
accomplished in Cartagena...[pauses] in Salvador-Bahia. 
  Participants were asked if they objected to any of the 
document's points before it was presented to the Colombian 
Foreign Ministry for completion. Not one country objected to 
that particular paragraph. That paragraph...[pauses] The 
meeting, regardless of yesterday's [words indistinct], is to 
improve. Some may even be astonished that we approved the 
paragraph and that [word indistinct] the word blockade does not 
appear because there seemed to be a problem with its definition. 
  Some of the people who spoke yesterday have as strong an 
opinion on this matter as we do. The great majority of those 
present voted in favor of Cuba at the UN General Assembly on 
something that is much more significant than this paragraph. 
Therefore, I do not think this will mean anything to us. The 
rest of the proposals are all included in the document. 
  The most important thing was for us to have the opportunity 
to express our views during the time allotted to us and to have 
opinions and points of view on issues that would make way for a 
debate and take advantage of the Colombian Government's proposal 
of turning this meeting into a real debate rather than the 
reading of speeches brought from outside. 
  [Correspondent] We have heard many opinions by foreign 
ministers on yesterday's [word indistinct] by the commander. 
  [Robaina] Yes, and I believe that you were more surprised 
than we were. There are many opinions. Undoubtedly, when one 
explains positions...[pauses] For example, I have found many 
people who say that issues were brought to the table once and 
for all, as they should be. I believe there are those who do 
not share his views because they may not feel at liberty, 
perhaps, to express the things that our president has expressed. 
Undoubtedly, they might be concerned. 
  Nevertheless, Cuba did not come for the other 22 
participants 
to share its views unanimously. Cuba has come so that its point 
of view is included in the analysis. We have all the authority, 
morale, history -- especially our president -- to express our 
points of view clearly and plainly. That is very important to 
me. 
  Many people congratulated the Cuban delegation and Fidel 
last night for having brought the issues to the table. We will 
have to get used to the fact that some will like what we say 
while others will not. 
  We do not say things just to get others to agree. We express 
our positions and principles. That is why they have been 
expressed with strength. Several people have approached Fidel 
to congratulate him on his actions and to say...[pauses] The 
best indicator was the room filling up so quickly, unlike 
anything else that had happened during the day. There was a 
special silence when our president expressed his views. 
  It is important that you realize that harsh, strong, and 
firm 
statements such as those will not have unanimous backing from 
those who do not want to commit to what we are discussing. We 
should not doubt this because the absence of opinions does not 
necessarily mean that they disagree. It could also mean that 
they prefer not to be publicly sympathetic in light of other 
types of pressure. Many public statements have been made on 
Cuba's participation in the summit despite all of this. 
  [Correspondent] Does the final document include the economic 
and trade agreements reached at the summit? 
  [Robaina] The final document includes an important part of 
our recommendations. It still does not constitute a true 
platform for the integration that should follow. It is 
unrealistic to think that the potential for economic integration 
that we see in America can be met during just one summit. 
Today, the Cuban delegation will be able to present its views 
on Cuban reality, how investments are progressing, and how we 
are less united and less integrated than ever today. That is 
the phenomenon that we face. We will not achieve this kind of 
integration with one strong document. We can achieve a stronger 
integration if all the presidents and delegations leave here 
willing to put these things into action. 
  [Correspondent] Speaking of these small meetings, perhaps 
Cuba can enter the Group of Three easier than any of the other 
groups? 
  [Robaina] Cuba did not come -- people have constantly been 
asking me this in the halls -- to seek membership in the OAS or 
any other specific regional or subregional group. The fact that 
we did not come for that purpose, however, does not mean that we 
are excluded. We have not closed the door on any possibility. 
Because we do not talk as much about [words indistinct]. We 
wish Latin America had a true [word indistinct]. That is what 
we want to accomplish. Cuba has not closed the door on any type 
of bilateral review with any country, even though at this moment 
and in midst of such a complex program you can understand that 
we have other priorities. 
  Economic advancement will allow us to enter into any group 
based on the principles that we respect, love, and defend. Cuba 
wanted...[pauses] That's why we were dissatisfied last night. 
How is it possible for such a meeting to be called and for 
Latin America not to have a common position with or without 
Cuba? Once again, this demonstrates how, before this meeting, 
which we salute and respect, we put aside our participation and 
our particular interests as a country. 
  Many have called to express their satisfaction with Fidel 
saying that he salutes the summit with very good intentions and 
that he respects the rights of others to have their own 
opinions, as some do. This is all that is needed to discuss 
true dialogue, unlike what the press, which has been following 
us around the hallways, has said, namely that we come here to 
express our views and do not accept contradicting views. That 
is not true. We accept and listen to anything they want to say. 
They, however, must listen to us as well. That is the 
phenomenon. Some began talking and thought that no one would 
refute those views. Of course not. We spoke yesterday, and we 
may have to speak today. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, I just want to point out that 
everyone praised Fidel at yesterday's news conference. My 
question is: Has anyone said anything about the U.S. observers 
at the summit? 
  [Robaina] The matter has not been discussed. We should not 
have to address [deshacer] an issue that torments us. U.S. 
observers have been mentioned basically because they are 
preparing the famous summit. The observers will take with them 
what we think of the summit. In other words, why make an issue 
of this? In this way, no one has to bring them Cuba's message 
on this summit being unnecessary. Cuba is not afraid. They are 
here primarily to learn about how to organize a summit. It 
seems that this is motivating their presence. I am sure they 
have a positive impression of what has taken place here. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, the media has been making a 
great deal about the commander's attire. 
  [Robaina] He was asked about this in public yesterday. I do 
not believe...[pauses] This generates all the speculation on 
whether it is a new style or if it is the beginning of something 
new. Let there be no doubt: He will continue wearing his olive 
green attire. The fact of the matter is that we are honoring 
the summit organizers' request despite response to the uniform 
being positive everywhere, including Cuba. We received a 
written request for the presidents to dress informally, in a 
guayavera or shirt. Our president honored the request, proving 
even more that he is not an obstinate man when it comes to 
history, a promise, or the olive green uniform. The host 
country requested informal dress, and Fidel came informal. 
  It was big news. Rest assured that he did not do it to make 
news and that [words indistinct] in olive green. Although this 
left a magnificent impression on Havana, let us not get carried 
away. Some have said that it marks the beginning of the end. 
If changing Cuba were as easy as changing into a guayavera, we 
would have sewn many guayaveras a long time ago. 
  [Correspondent] The guayavera is a symbol of Cubanism. 
  [Robaina] Yes, but it is superficial. To those who say that 
Fidel is incapable of this or that, there you have it. This 
also demonstrates Fidel's ability to adapt to the place, the 
moment, and the conditions. Some said this was impossible. The 
people in Havana with whom I was talking say they are 
traumatized by the guayavera. They cannot wait to see if he 
will wear the guayavera in Havana. That is a phenomenon. He is 
wearing a guayavera and blue slacks today. Let us not start 
describing his socks, etc...[laughs] 
  [Correspondent] How did Cuba receive Bolivia's statements 
following the commander's address? 
  [Robaina] Many expressed satisfaction with Fidel's address. 
Brazilian President Itamar Franco and many others expressed 
satisfaction. Fidel's statements were obviously not in 
agreement with some of the addresses presented there. If you 
review past summits, you can see that many others begin to 
publicly express themselves in favor of Cuba, in addition to 
those who are concerned and sympathetic toward Cuba. Even 
though we are not where we would like to be at the moment, the 
number of people who dare speak out is much higher than in past 
years. 
  [Correspondent] [Words indistinct]. 
  [Robaina] Regarding diplomatic relations with Honduras, I 
must point out that we do not have diplomatic relations with 
three or four of the countries that are present. Nevertheless, 
the absence of formal diplomatic relations does not keep us from 
having contacts that allow us to talk about our relations even 
if they are not diplomatic. 
  I wish to stress that Cuba is neither preoccupied nor 
obsessed nor [words indistinct] steps that have been taken. We 
express this to everyone. President Castro himself expressed 
that to President Reina today. We do not want the Honduran 
people to feel any pressure from Cuba to establish diplomatic 
relations because we already communicate with them. Honduras 
must determine when conditions are appropriate because on our 
side there are no conditions.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National </F>
Assembly of the People's Government, by special correspondents 
Blanche Petrich, Josexto Zaldua, and Emilio Lomas at the Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias on 14 June] 
  [Text] Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, 15 Jun -- Not as good 
as Guadalajara in 1991, but not as bad, either. Evaluating 
Cuba's performance at the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, Ricardo 
Alarcon, president of the Cuban National Assembly of the 
People's Government [ANPP], concluded that "our satisfaction is 
greater" because we were able to overcome more significant 
threats than before. 
  One threat to Cuban diplomacy is the shadow cast by the 
Clinton administration's initiative to hold a hemispheric summit 
in Miami at the end of this year with all the continent's heads 
of state except Cuba's. 
  On this occasion, the threat took the name and shape of a 
woman, Harriet Babbitt, U.S. ambassador to the OAS, who 
yesterday appeared in the president's session hall sitting very 
seriously beside Rosario Green, Mexican under secretary to the 
United Nations. According to Alarcon, Babbitt was able to "slip 
in," but her presence neither annoyed nor cheered the Cubans. 
"Just as long as she knows how to conduct herself," he commented 
sarcastically. 
  Today there was another noteworthy person; an unidentified 
diplomat, but one whom everyone identifies as high-ranking and 
responsible for organizing the "other" meeting in Miami. The 
uneasiness felt by many heads of state was noticeable since the 
diplomat, along with Ambassador Babbitt, was wearing a badge on 
his lapel that gave him access to the most restricted areas, 
where today only heads of state and their ministers were free to 
go. The badge is only given to very high-ranking officials. 
"Prerogatives of the host," an uncomfortable diplomat resigned 
himself. 
  Ricardo Alarcon, who has been beside Fidel Castro since the 
first Ibero-American summit, granted an interview and stressed 
that there was neither more nor less tension prior to and 
following the unexpected speech by the Cuban president during 
the final minutes of yesterday's plenary session. Alarcon also 
denies that Castro's complaints about the presidents' compliant 
position toward the U.S. blockade were "out of place." 
  Alarcon believes that those heads of state who alluded to 
Cuba's internal system were out of place and he said they should 
keep in mind "the principle of national sovereignty at least 
once in a while." That oversight was indeed "an unfortunate 
slip." 
  Alarcon added that the takeover of diplomatic missions in 
Havana over the past few days by groups of Cubans demanding 
visas to leave the island is on the verge of becoming a "daily 
practice," that could even signal the end of the diplomatic 
system unless governments clearly stipulate that this is not a 
means of obtaining travel documents and the United States ceases 
to encourage the illegal departure of Cubans. 
  [LA JORNADA] President Fidel Castro's unscheduled statements 
caused an uproar yesterday afternoon... 
  [Alarcon] I would not say that it was outside the agenda. I 
think it was necessary for a country that was mentioned several 
times during this meeting to say something about that. In fact, 
President Itamar Franco, speaking for the second time, said it 
was necessary that he clarify his position with respect to the 
issue mentioned by other speakers. Their statements were indeed 
outside the agenda because they made comments that they 
considered necessary but which were inappropriate for an 
international conference. 
  [LA JORNADA] Sovereignty is perhaps the oldest principle of 
international law in Latin America and should be remembered at 
least now and then. That principle is truly sacred on this 
continent. Speaking outside the agenda constitutes a serious 
slip because this sacred principle is overlooked. 
  [Alarcon] The international community is inclined to deal 
with internal issues such as democracy, crime, drug trafficking, 
multilateral diplomatic actions... 
  The idea of democracy as such comes from a democratic 
concept 
called plurality, but lately there have been attempts to link 
the idea of democracy with certain events [torneos], 
appearances, and formalities. In the Ibero-American community, 
we repeat daily that we share a common language. Let us look in 
the dictionary for a definition of democracy. If memory serves 
me correctly, the academy describes democracy as a political 
system in which the people participate. It does not say it is a 
political system that every now and then must change colors or 
pay millions for television advertisements to sell candidates as 
if they were toothpaste. 
  [LA JORNADA] What is Harriet Babbitt, U.S. ambassador to 
the OAS, doing here? How do you assess that? It is the first 
time the United States has attended an Ibero-American summit 
meeting. 
  [Alarcon] I imagine that she slipped in because she has no 
right to be here. 
  [LA JORNADA] And nobody told her so? 
  [Alarcon] As far as I know, there was no meeting to discuss 
whether observer status would be granted to a country that is 
not Ibero-American. I thought of a whole list of countries more 
appropriate to attend that are not doing so. I am talking about 
other Portuguese-speaking countries or countries that speak 
neither Spanish nor Portuguese but which are Latin American as 
they are part of our history, such as Haiti or Jamaica. 
  [LA JORNADA] Is her presence healthy? 
  [Alarcon] It is all the same to me. I just want her to 
behave properly and not make any noise. She is involved in 
another conference, the orientation of which could contradict 
the orientation of this conference. 
  [LA JORNADA] Could the Miami summit in December interfere 
with the course of this Ibero-American summit? What could this 
entail for Cuba? 
  [Alarcon] It is a summit with particular characteristics. 
There is no preparatory work, no program, and no discussion 
topics. It seems to be something for fortune-tellers. It should 
definitely be a source of great concern. 
  [LA JORNADA] Certain people, President Cesar Gaviria and 
Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin, for example, have established a 
certain relationship between the changes being demanded of Cuba 
and the fact that Fidel donned a guayabera instead of his 
military uniform. There has been, let us say, a lot of mental 
masturbation to give meaning to your guayabera. What is your 
opinion on Fidel Castro's guayabera? 
  [Alarcon] We learned that informal clothing would be worn 
here. Formal wear in Cuba is a shirt and tie. Informal for 
some is a short-sleeved shirt. For us, it is a guayabera. It 
is the national dress. As for the changes, some people insist 
that we must change to look more like a democracy. When one 
really believes in democracy, one must believe in plurality 
above all and in diversity to ensure that each country's people 
decides their own fate. The mental masturbation you mentioned 
is a reflection of manipulation. 
  [LA JORNADA] What does the successive occupation of 
diplomatic missions in Havana suggest to you? 
  [Alarcon] It is a reflection of the U.S. manipulation of 
emigration. The people occupying those diplomatic missions do 
not want to go to Antwerp or Brussels. 
  The United States is the only country that has two 
immigration laws; one for the world and the other, the 
adjustment law, which gives priority to Cuban citizens who 
arrive in their territory claiming to be politically persecuted 
in order to block the legal entry of those who wish to emigrate. 
This law simultaneously promotes illegal departures. The 
adjustment law for Cubans will be 30 years old. It dates back 
to 1966. I do not know what would happen in another country if 
there were a similar law for them. 
  Another suggestion is that a generalization of actions such 
as this one would bring about disaster. There are millions of 
potential economic emigres in the world. A generalization would 
mark the end of the diplomatic system, the law of the jungle 
would prevail. 
  [LA JORNADA] Three missions were occupied in past days; the 
Belgian, German, and Chilean Consulates. Could this become 
widespread? 
  [Alarcon] We can solve this problem in a civilized manner. 
We have said that the people who violated diplomatic missions 
will not be punished. Those embassies must recognize that this 
is no means to travel to those countries. If we do not make 
this clear, this could indeed become normal practice. This will 
not end as long as the United States continues to implement its 
immigration policy. Part of the solution is to convince these 
people to use peaceful means. The other part is to allow them 
to emigrate normally if they wish to do so

  [Text] Santiago, Chile, 17 Jun (DPA) -- Today, Chilean 
Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa said Chile is asking the eight 
Cubans who occupied the Chilean Consulate in Havana last 
Wednesday to leave the mission peacefully. 
  The foreign minister said they have received assurances from 
the Cuban Government that no reprisals will be taken against the 
eight persons, including a woman and a 12-year-old child whose 
parents are not in the group. Cuba reiterated to Chilean 
authorities that it does not accept the forceful entry into 
diplomatic missions as a form of pressure to obtain a visa to 
leave the country, the foreign minister added. 
  Figueroa noted that Cuban President Fidel Castro and Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina assured them that once the people had 
left the embassy, they could request whatever visas they wished. 
Since it involves a consulate, Chile cannot grant them asylum, 
rather "humanitarian refuge," Figueroa said, noting that the 
topic is being discussed simultaneously with the occupiers and 
the Cuban Government. 
  Chile and Cuba severed diplomatic relations following the 11 
September 1973 military coup and resumed ties at the consular 
level as of 1991. 
  Figueroa explained that thus far, relations between the two 
nations "are adequate," and Chile is not demanding that 
political changes occur on the island as a condition for the 
establishment of diplomatic ties, but that it is studying the 
situation. "We have never established conditions at any time," 
the foreign minister stated, adding that his Cuban colleague 
Roberto Robaina will visit Chile in August. "I hope that before 
he arrives, the topic (of the consulate occupants) will be 
resolved," he said.

  [Text] Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa has stated 
that his country has not set political conditions for 
reestablishing diplomatic relations with Cuba at the embassy 
level while consular links continue to increase as a result of 
tourism, investment, and trade. Figueroa recalled that he had 
invited Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina to visit Chile 
this coming August. 
  With respect to the decision by eight Cubans to forcibly 
remain inside the Chilean Consulate in Havana, the minister 
stated that the important issue is to observe international law. 
He also reiterated that Cuba does not condone the forceful 
occupation of diplomatic missions as a mechanism to leave the 
country. 
  Figueroa stressed that the Cuban authorities had guaranteed 
that there would be no reprisals against those who voluntarily 
decide to leave the Chilean Consulate and begin normal 
procedures to leave the country.

  [Text] Havana, 18 Jun (AFP) -- Cuban police sources 
reported that at least eight of the 118 Cuban refugees who have 
been at the Belgian ambassador's residence in Havana since 18 
May left this afternoon. The same sources said that most of 
those who left were women and children. 
  Reporters near the residence verified that there was more 
movement than usual of diplomatic vehicles, but they were unable 
to determine the exact number of people leaving the residence. 
  Another 21 persons have taken refuge at the German Embassy 
,and eight are at the Chilean Consulate, both located in the 
same neighborhood of Miramar. These people hope to obtain 
political asylum abroad.

  [Text] Havana, 19 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Cuban Foreign 
Ministry has announced that the government "categorically" 
confirmed today that it will deny all persons who have 
forcefully entered a diplomatic mission permission to leave the 
island. 
  A Foreign Ministry note published in the weekly JUVENTUD 
REBELDE reports that the refusal will be maintained "even if 
they leave the embassy. No exception will be made." 
  The note reported that on 28 May more than 100 people 
entered 
the residence of the Belgian ambassador, on 13 June, 20 people 
broke into the German Embassy compound in a vehicle, and on 15 
June, nine people entered the Chilean Consulate.

  [Text] Madrid, 19 Jun (AFP) -- The entry by approximately 
150 Cubans into three embassies in Havana is a "provocation by 
enemies" of Cuba who could "have some sort of organization in 
the country." This was said to EL PAIS, a Spanish daily, by 
Carlos Lage, executive secretary of the Council of Ministers and 
a close aide of Fidel Castro. 
  Lage, a 42-year-old pediatrician, recalls that Cuba grants 
exit permits to whoever wants to travel and notes that "no one 
involved in this type of incident can leave the country." The 
only solution is for the refugees in the embassies "to leave 
with our guarantees that there will be no reprisals against 
them," he added. 
  Lage, who is also one of the persons responsible for Cuban 
economic reforms, defended the "socialist model" and the 
"fundamental" role of a planned economy, but did not reject 
"openings to the private initiative" or "private work" in 
certain sectors. He noted Cuba's encouragement of tourism and 
foreign investments (an example of which is the sale of 49 
percent of the shares of the telephone company to a Mexican 
enterprise) and its transformation of state farms into 
cooperatives. 
  Regarding an eventual political change, Lage was blunt: 
"Cuba's problems are of an economic nature, and the solutions we 
need are of an economic nature." "It is possible" to improve 
the political system, "but not through elections aimed at 
producing a multiparty system," he said. 
  Regarding speculation that some day he could succeed Fidel 
Castro, he said: "I do not believe I am the right person." 
"Besides," he explained, "here there is someone who is second in 
command in the country's leadership; that is Raul Castro. 
Castro's replacement is thus already known."

  [Text] Havana, 17 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Juan Fleites Melo, 
director of the state-owned Cuba Petroleum [CUPET] enterprise, 
confirmed here today that the enterprise has been talking with 
Mexpetrol, a privately-owned Mexican consortium, about using a 
Cuban refinery. Fleites said a letter of intent was signed 
"recently" by CUPET and Mexican enterprises for the latter to 
use the Cienfuegos refinery, located 336 km southeast from 
Havana. 
  Speaking for GRANMA INTERNATIONAL, the official declined to 
mention the investment required to activate this facility, which 
is capable of refining 21 million barrels of crude oil annually. 
  Although an agreement with Russia, the largest of the former 
Soviet republics, guarantees an annual exchange of 17.5 million 
barrels of oil for one million tons of sugar, Cuba requires at 
least 42 million barrels of oil per year. 
  The Cienfuegos refinery is one of the last projects built by 
the now defunct Soviet Union. Three years ago, Cuba began 
negotiating with several countries to reactivate the plant. 
  Fleites said foreign firms have invested approximately $120 
million prospecting for oil in Cuba and that 16 of the Cuban 
territory's 33 blocks have been auctioned off in international 
risk contracts. 
  CUPET is associated with Canada's CNW and Talisman firms; 
France's Total and Geopetrol; the UK's Premier and British 
Borneo; and Sweden's Taurus. 
  According to Fleites, the discovery of oil in the Bay of 
Cardenas in Matanzas Province in western Cuba "confirms the 
presence of hydrocarbons in the country."

  [Text] Havana, 13 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Mexican private 
sector will purchase Cuba's debt with Mexico through the 
issuance of "swaps," Enrique Vilatela, director of the National 
Foreign Trade Bank (Bancomext), said here today. 
  In an interview, Vilatela explained that the negotiation 
would take place through the issuance of swaps (debt bonds) so 
that Mexican businessmen can purchase Cuban enterprises' assets. 
The Bancomext director, who is accompanying Mexican President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari during his state visit, said the 
solution to the island's debt with Mexico will be through 
refinancing the debt. He pointed out that the appropriate 
institutions in both countries must reach an agreement on 
refinancing the debt and bond issuance. 
  Up until the end of 1993, Cuba's debt with Mexico was $313.4 
million, of which $192.7 million was already overdue. The Cuban 
debt was refinanced in 1982, 1986, 1989, and 1991, which was the 
last time. The last refinancing of the debt was declared 
unfulfilled six months later because of Cuba's economic problems 
and because the mechanism that was established refinanced the 
debt for only four years. 
  Luis German Carcoba, president of the Mexican Business 
Coordinating Council, confirmed the decision to invest in Cuba 
and added that textile and soft drink projects, among others, 
are already being implemented. Carcoba, who is also 
accompanying the Mexican president on his six-hour tour to this 
nation, said, however, that in the meeting held by the 
presidents and the trade delegations of Mexico and Cuba, no 
specific agreements are expected. 
  The Mexican businesses that plan to make investments in Cuba 
are Grupo Infra de Gases y Equipos, Industrias Unidas de 
Telefonia de Larga Distancia, and Buffete Industrial, with 
modernization projects for 20 hotels in this city. 
  Also participating were Cemex, which has a cement plant 
here; 
Domeq, which will negotiate the importation of Cuban rum to 
Mexico; Telecomunicaciones Internacionales de Mexico, founder of 
Cubacel; Incorporacion Internacional Comercial, which exports 
Mexican beer; and Grupo Dsc, which is a hotel business.

  [Text] Cuba's problems are economic, and the solutions we 
need are of an economic nature. This is why the reforms are 
made within our political system without being associated with 
any transformation, said Carlos Lage, executive secretary of the 
Cuban Council of Ministers, during an interview published today 
in the Spanish daily EL PAIS. 
  Lage indicated that it is possible to improve the Cuban 
political system, however, not through elections in a multiparty 
system. The Cuban leader explained that the Caribbean nation is 
being flexible in its economic model and is willing to make the 
necessary changes, but not by moving toward capitalism, rather 
by consolidating an efficient socialist economy. 
  When questioned about groups of Cubans who are in the 
Belgium 
and German embassies and the Chilean consulate here in Havana, 
Carlos Lage said that occupying a diplomatic mission is not the 
way to leave Cuba because the country grants permits to whoever 
requests them. Moreover, he reiterated that the sole solution 
to the conflict is for those people to leave the buildings they 
are occupying with the government's guarantee that there will be 
no reprisals against them.

  [Text] On 17 June, PRC Ambassador to Cuba Xu Yicong and 
several Embassy staff members paid an official visit to 
Guantanamo Province. Upon his arrival in this city, Xu Yicong 
was extensively briefed by Juan Carlos Robinson, member of the 
central committee of the Communist Party of Cuba and first 
secretary of the party in the province, on social and economic 
developments in the province. Robinson informed Xu Yicong of the 
efforts that the population is making to eliminate, as soon as 
possible, the consequences of the May rains, which caused 
damages estimated at 90 million pesos. 
  Xu Yicong expressed satisfaction with his visit to 
Guantanamo 
and highlighted the similarity of ideas, principles, and paths 
chosen by the peoples of Cuba and of China to build socialism, 
aside from the different characteristics of the two countries.

conducted a two-day visit to 12 Basic Cooperative Production 
Units [UBPC's] in Granma Province. During the visit, he observed 
the work being done in the province to repair damages caused by 
heavy rains in May. Alfredo Enriquez Pina, member of the Central 
Committee and first secretary of the provincial committee of the 
Communist Party of Cuba, accompanied Machado. 
  At the end of the visit, Machado Ventura stressed the 
importance of strengthening the workers' and relatives' 
self-sufficiency efforts in the UBPC's. He pointed out that this 
is an essential endeavor to boost the workers' spirits as well 
as to improve work attendance and the use of human and material 
resources. 
  Machado Ventura praised the positive changes in the cattle 
and sugarcane units visited in Granma, in terms of production 
and work organization, while criticizing low yields in the 
production of tubers and vegetables.

  [Text] A significant number of mills are still grinding 
sugarcane in Cuba, although the largest number of them are 
concentrated in the eastern region where the greatest amount of 
raw material can be found. The complexes are still making an 
enormous effort in the sugar harvest despite the characteristics 
proper to the month of June: a decrease in the amount of 
sugarcane, intense heat, and the raw material being widely 
spread out, in some areas. 
  Raul Trujillo, first vice minister of the Sugar Industry, 
informed Radio Reloj that one of the provinces that is still 
working hard is Pinar del Rio. The Harlem and Manuel Sandino 
complexes have been reinforced by manual canecutting brigades 
from Havana. Trujillo pointed out that in Sancti Spiritus, the 
Uruguay sugarcane complex, the largest complex in Cuba, is 
making a final effort to deliver sugar, aided by the sugarcane 
received from Ciego de Avila Province.

  [Text] Inspectors from nine Havana administrative councils 
have fined over 300 self-employed workers for violations and 
irregularities in exercising this type of work. Provinicial 
labor committee figures indicate that 26,388 inspections had 
been conducted by the end of May in the 133 self-employment 
categories approved by the provincial administrative councils. 
Of the 555 fines, over 300 were issued against people who do 
unauthorized work and 60 people who render services but were not 
registered with the municipality. Another group was issued 
fines for using middlemen or selling products in areas 
prohibited by the city's regulations. The labor committee also 
revoked the licenses of over 350 repeat offenders and has 
confiscated merchandise, mainly snacks and agricultural 
products, from approximately 60 people. 
  Manuel Fernandez, director of labor and social security in 
Havana, said the fines total over 450,000 pesos and affirmed 
that strict controls will be maintained. Fernandez also said 
that over 40,000 people are registered for self-employment work 
in Havana.

  [Text] The confiscation of the moneybags' [maceta] goods 
and assets resulting from ill-gotten wealth is a coordinated and 
effective effort being conducted by the General Attorney's 
Office and its provincial and municipal branches to fight 
corruption in our society. To conduct this systematic work, 
prosecutors first make an inventory of the goods in the 
possession of the person under investigation and check it 
against real income. Those goods without official documentation 
are held until the owner proves their legality. The Finance and 
Prices Ministry is in charge of issuing confiscation papers and 
transferring the goods to the state. 
  We will hear about the case of another one of these 
moneybags 
who resorted to illegal wealth to satisfy disproportionate 
material cravings. Here is Enrique Valdez Machin, from the 
Havana prosecutor's office, on implementing Decree-Law 149 
against those who become wealthy through theft, embezzlement, 
speculation, and other illegal activities: 
  [Begin Valdez recording] Havana prosecutors carried out a 
search, according to the law, of the home of one of these 
renowned moneybags and seized one fan, two ceiling fans, one air 
conditioner, two digital clock-radios, two color televisions, 
two refrigerators, one freezer, one VCR, three remote controls, 
one plastic pool, three cars, one motorcycle, one two-story 
house, and numerous vehicular spare parts and domestic items. 
  How can someone who does not work acquire all these things? 
Where did he get the money from? How many years of honest and 
well-remunerated work would be required to accumulate even a 
portion of the things seized from this house? The 
implementation of Decree-Law 149 has brought to light, in all 
its crudeness, the situation of many people who took advantage 
of the workers' labor to satisfy their personal cravings. The 
time of reckoning has come for these social parasites. We are 
witnessing the beginning of the end of the moneybags. [end

  [Text] One hundred seventy state and self-employed workers 
as well as pensioners from Guisa Municipality have applied for 
land grants to begin producing coffee in the mountains of Granma 
Province. The need to increase coffee production, a source of 
hard currency for Cuba, as well as a way of repopulating the 
mountain region of Guisa, which has a shortage of workers, was 
stressed in a meeting with 18 of these applicants. 
  Agriculture Minister Alfredo Jordan Morales and Alfredo 
Enriquez Pina announced that these workers and their relatives 
add up to 472 people; they can tend an area of 387 caballerias 
for coffee production. Jordan added that this situation is 
under study to set up contracts and to grant the land to them, 
since in the mountain regions of the country, there are 
approximately 2,000 caballerias that the state cannot make 
productive because of labor force shortages. 
  Alfredo Enriquez Pina stated that everyone moving to the 
mountains, people with demonstrated revolutionary aptitudes, 
people able to make the land produce, people able to repopulate 
the mountains, and zealous guardians of the Revolution must be 
given incentives.

  [Text] Alfredo Jordan Morales, Politburo member and 
agriculture minister, has met with farmers in Guisa 
Municipality, Granma Province. They want to return to the 
mountains, to land they abandoned when the Revolution triumphed. 
The Agriculture Ministry is evaluating and accepting these 
petitions, acting under a Politburo accord that allows the state 
or cooperatives to give up unattended land that has agricultural 
potential. 
  Approximately 600 caballerias to date have been apportioned 
and are now covered with tobacco crops, worked by the people who 
have made these requests. Jordan spoke at length with those who 
were originally farmers and who are now working in restaurants 
or other activities in the cities. These lands, abandoned for 
more than 20 years and having agricultural potential and will be 
replanted with tobacco, coffee, trees, and other crops. 
  Jordan told the farmers that the Agriculture Ministry will 
be 
happy to review any request from anyone anywhere in the country. 
Jordan went on to inform them that the Ministry is confiscating 
the land of those farmers who do not meet the commitments they 
have with the state. 
  Family contract [contrato familiar] is the name given to the 
document that was drafted by the Agriculture Ministry and the 
bank that grants credit to those who request this contract to 
cover initial expenses. It is nice to know that farmers, 
people, and families are requesting land so that the production 
of tubers, vegetables, and grain -- food for our population -- 
increases.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] Cuba's presence at the Fourth Ibero-American Summit 
in Cartagena de Indias was closely linked with its interest in 
adopting specific actions in favor of regional integration. That 
is why it supported previous presidential summits and the one 
that recently concluded in Colombia. Everything that sponsors 
trade -- investments, exchanges, technical aid, and scientific 
and technical cooperation in this hemisphere -- has been firmly 
supported by this blockaded island. In fact, the Cuban position 
goes so far as to support the so-called second generation 
economic reforms proposed by the United States for this region, 
provided the summit unilaterally organized for December in Miami 
does not become a forum to set guidelines for Latin America and 
to isolate Cuba. 
  Making progress within the integration plans is still part 
of 
the Cuban position, even when results achieved in this respect 
at three previous summits have somehow failed to fulfill the 
hopes for an effective, specific consensus. Even though Latin 
American countries have participated in the integrationist 
efforts exerted for many years, they admit they have yet to 
eliminate the obstacles that must preclude an integration in the 
economic, trade, and investment sectors despite a more favorable 
international situation. This is proved by the underhanded 
economic pressure frequently exerted by the United States on 
nations in this geographic area. 
  The presidents' reflections on the economic, trade, and 
financial blockade against Cuba were not directly expressed in 
their speeches to the fourth summit's plenary session, nor were 
they included in the lengthy text of the final declaration. 
Paradoxically, the most important international organization, 
the UN General Assembly, approved resolutions that condemn the 
blockade that the United States maintains against our country, 
yet the summit of statesmen and rulers in this hemisphere 
briefly alludes to the unjustifiable measure without even 
calling it by its name.

<F P=106> [From the "NTV" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Approximately 50,000 families in Havana depend on 
manufactured gas, and current limitations of that fuel 
negatively affect between 475,000 and 500,000 persons. 
  Two plants supply the capital, the Mario Fortuni Plant, 
which 
operates with French technology, and the so-called Melones 
plant, which was purchased in the United States at the turn of 
the century. Jointly, they produce a little bit over 400,000 
cubic meters of manufactured gas, a volume far below the current 
demand. 
  Although other factors are involved, four have essentially 
caused a production deficit in that industry: a tank out of 
service due to necessary repairs; lack of number 40 gas because 
the Nico Lopez Refinery closed down; damage in one of the Mario 
Fortuni Plant's lines; and a failure in its hydraulic system due 
to low-quality rubber gaskets. 
  [Begin recording] [Engineer Flora Elena Mesa] Repairs 
disrupt 
our service because although we can manufacture gas at night, we 
need to stop once the storage tanks are full -- we have nowhere 
else to store the gas -- and the next day we have less gas 
available to provide this service to the population. 
  Regarding the rubber gaskets problem, some of the gaskets 
lasted three, six, and even 12 months -- for example the 
(Clavier) gaskets -- yet these last only a week, 15 days, 
sometimes hours. This results in constant breakdowns, and we 
have to stop the plant to solve the problem. 
  This line should have been repaired by now. Its 
effectiveness 
has decreased; its efficiency is not the same and it has lower 
production. 
  The lack of number 40 gas... [pauses] like I said, the Nino 
Lopez Refinery's catalytic cracking plant, the one that produces 
liquefied gas, is undergoing general repairs. Consequently, we 
cannot receive the number 40 gas, which represents an important 
support in our production. 
  [Unidentified Reporter] When do you think the gas service 
can 
be restored? 
  [Mesa] The situation cannot change in the near future 
because 
the gasket problem has not been solved, and the gasometer is

<F P=106> [Report by Carlos Rafael Jimenez for the "Doing Radio" </F>
program in Havana -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] We are in front of the 
provincial directorate for aqueducts, sewers, and ditches in 
Havana. Carlos Rollan, Jose Silva, and I are here in an effort 
to get a firsthand report on water distribution. It is true we 
have received more calls than usual this morning. People have 
called us, although they are well aware of the limitations we 
have concerning the distribution of water, meaning you get it 
every other day. 
  For example, Mr. Mendez called us today and said La Vibora 
was scheduled to get water yesterday, but that they got it for 
only one hour. Others called us from Havana's old sector and 
downtown areas. 
  In other words, we got more calls than usual to talk about 
water distribution. This prompted us to come here to the office 
in charge of Havana's aqueducts. I am waiting for Comrade 
Humberto Munguia, assistant director of the waterworks. He was 
located by plant personnel, brought directly from the operations 
room, and was asked to come here. He said he will be here in 
approximately 15 minutes. 
  Meanwhile, I have something to announce. El Gato aqueduct 
will shut down today for maintenance work. Everyone knows it was 
built some years ago and has helped considerably in the 
distribution of water in Havana. The facilities in Vento, that 
historic aqueduct, also faces problems because its reservoir 
levels are low. I looked at the tanks through which water is 
gravity-fed at El Alvear, and I saw that their contents are far 
below the necessary level. 
  Since I am not a specialist on this topic, we will wait for 
Comrade Humberto Munguia's reprt on the topic that brought me 
here, meaning that although they are aware of the limitations, 
people called me to report that the distribution of water in 
Havana has decreased.

<F P=106> [Report by Manolo Rodriguez Salas from Pinar del Rio for the </F>
"NTV newscast"] 
  [Text] In a dignified salute to 14 June, the date when two 
of the greatest men in our history were born, Antonio Maceo and 
Ernesto Che Guevara, the citizens of Pinar del Rio have obtained 
the first 100 grams of gold at the plant in Castellanos, Minas 
de Matahambre Municipality. The investment had been planned 
barely two years and four months ago. 
  Hundreds of workers, mostly members of the Celso Maraotolara 
Brigade, as well as engineers, project managers, and technicians 
from the Ministry of Basic Industry gave additional proof of our 
people's intelligence and capacity when they got the plant 
operating without foreign consultation. Also, this is a 
one-of-a-kind project in the country. The new plant is capable 
of delivering up to 500 kg of gold per year for seven or eight 
years; it is considered the most feasible of all the 
gold-producing plants in Cuba. 
  The sulphur plant was also reopened. This year, it has a 
pledge to deliver 32,000 tons of sulphuric acid, which is an 
essential product for the nickel industry.

    [Editorial Report] Port-au-Prince Radio Metropole in French 
at 1045 GMT on 17 June carries its regularly scheduled newscast, 
which includes the following reports: 
<H5>  Government Urges Public To Help Police </H5>
  "The government in Port-au-Prince has asked everyone living 
in the cities and in the provinces to remain alert to the 
current team's orders and to collaborate with the local police 
forces and to be ready, if the case arises, to lend them a hand 
in fulfilling the exceptional duties that the latest 
acceleration of the crisis has imposed." 
<H5>  Ministry Release on Housing Foreigners </H5>
  "The Information and Coordination Ministry has reissued an 
Interior Ministry press release reminding hotels, boarding 
houses, and people housing foreigners that under Article 60/61 
of the 26 December 1978 law, they are required to notify the 
Immigration and Emigration Service as well as the Police Bureau 
within 24 hours of the arrival of a customer, resident, or 
foreign tenant." 
<H5>  Front Official Chambelain Returns </H5>
  "Louis Jodel Chambelain has returned to the fold. 
Chambelain, who temporarily distanced himself from his 
political base, seems to have recovered his position within the 
Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti. 
Chambelain renewed his support for the Jonassaint government 
after several untimely statements." 
  Radio Metropole then airs the following recorded remarks by 
Chambelain: "We respond to the appointment today as we did in 
Crete-a-Pierrot, Breda, and the Citadelle Henri. How can we 
forget 11 October 1993, the lucky day when all of our cohorts 
demonstrated a chivalrous spirit and, in unison along the 
Port-au-Prince shoreline, protested the opposition and its 
self-interested generosity under the cover of humanitarian aid. 
How can we forget those deeply moving pages in history on which 
the story is written of burning tires burning our alive 
brothers? The pills of yesterday are too hard to swallow. No! 
We will not change."

  [Text] The Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Haiti 
advises in a press release that although it had decided to 
maintain silence, it now finds itself compelled to break this 
silence and raise the most energetic protest against the threats 
of intervention to the country. The Chamber makes a point of 
advising that in keeping with the Constitution, it will never 
accept an attack on Haiti's sovereignty. The Chamber of Commerce 
and Industry of Haiti believes that it must also protest to the 
American people and the international organizations the untimely 
statements of President Clinton's representative, William Gray. 
Mr. Gray, states the Chamber of Commerce, in the policy that he 
is ready to apply without visiting Haiti, without knowing the 
country's problems, without getting in touch with the Haitian 
organizations, attacks the Haitian people. 
  Mr. Gray totally ignores the fact that 90 percent of all 
airline tickets are bought and used by a small group of vendors. 
Indeed more than 2,000 to 3,000 venders travel back and forth to 
Miami, New York, Curacao, and Panama to supply themselves with 
goods for resale, and to provide jobs to more than 10,000 small 
distributors. It is this possibility that Mr. Gray wants to 
prevent because it will increase the number of boat people, 
since this group will no longer be able to feed their families, 
states the Chamber of Commerce. Out of 700,000 airline tickets, 
this group uses approximately 600,000. Only 100,000 tickets are 
used by the so-called wealthy class and the middle class, those 
traveling on business and to visit their children studying 
abroad. 
  Moreover, implying that $50 a month should be enough to 
support a Haitian family is without a doubt, says the Chamber, 
an insult to a whole nation, and a scandal similar to genocide. 
Such statements and all of those who approve of Mr. Gray have 
ignored the Haitians themselves and are considered detractors 
and destroyers of the Haitian nation. Furthermore, it is 
incomprehensible that to restore democracy to Haiti, dictatorial 
formulas are being used, such as freezing all Haitians' bank 
accounts in the United States, and imposing an unfair, criminal 
embargo. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Haiti takes 
this occasion to reiterate that only Haitians will succeed in 
solving the current crisis of the country.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 17 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Haitian 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry today condemned the 
international embargo against this Caribbean country and labeled 
it "unfair and criminal." In addition, other procoupist sectors 
reaffirmed their support for the military. 
  The Chamber of Commerce criticized the possibility of 
military intervention in Haiti and censured U.S. Government 
representative William Gray, who said the Haitian private sector 
had admitted that the military's permanence in power is harmful 
for private sector interests. 
  Lawyer Mireille Durocher Bertin, who supports the military, 
pointed out that "the High Command's resignation, demanded by 
the UN Security Council, is equivalent to the destabilization of 
the Army and, therefore, of all national institutions." 
Conversely, pro-Aristide Deputy Samuel Madistin said "General 
Cedras' resignation is the first step toward resolving the 
crisis." 
  In view of the situation, U.S. diplomatic personnel started 
to leave the country on Thursday. Unofficial sources, however, 
have said that 75 U.S. Embassy officials will stay. According 
to Radio Metropole, thousands of U.S. citizens, including 
naturalized Haitians, have returned to their home country so far 
and that 1,368 Haitians, who obtained political asylum in the 
United States, are expected to travel to this country before 25 
June. 
  As for the application of the embargo, banned products keep 
entering Haiti through the border with the Dominican Republic 
despite the presence of numerous soldiers and international 
observers. Gasoline vendors, who work for the military and 
their associates, appear to be surprised about the large amount 
of fuel available. "The price keeps getting lower. It rose when 
the border closure was announced. Shortly thereafter, however, 
because it was so easy to obtain it, the price started to drop. 
Now, gasoline costs 20 percent less than last week," one of the 
vendors said. 
  The remarks by members of the different sectors occurred 
nine 
days after Canada stopped flights to Haiti and one week before 
the United States applies a similar measure.

  [Text] The sessions of the ministers of the Jonassaint 
government have resumed in the Senate of the Republic, Sansaricq 
branch. The minister of Health was received on 16 June by the 
contested 18 January elected senators and some senators from the 
Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion. In his presentation, Dr. 
Jean Boirond insisted, at length, on the necessity for the 
Haitian state to take control of public health throughout the 
country. Moreover, he denounced the attitude of the 
nongovernmental organizations [NGO's] and of the World Health 
Organization [WHO] which attempt, according to the minister, to 
replace the Haitian state in the health fields. 
  [Begin Boirond recording] The NGO's have taken advantage of 
the political situation, with the complicity of the 
international organizations in general, and the representation 
of the health organizations, especially WHO, by attempting to 
replace, and in some specific fields, in fact usurp, the 
prerogatives granted to the Health Ministry by the Constitution 
and the laws in effect. The objectives that we are aiming at, 
since our appointment, are first: to reestablish the authority 
and credibility of the Ministry of Public Health and Population; 
second, to put in operation some central and outlying structures 
of the Ministry of Public Health and Population; third, to 
guarantee an acceptable level of care as much in quality as 
quantity for the overall population and, especially for the 
populations in difficulty; and fourth, to prepare the transition. 
  We have been giving ourselves priorities that I am going to 
present for your judgment. First, we think it is necessary to 
make primary medical care available, for which some assistance 
is already available in the country at the level of primary 
health care. Our second priority is still the hospital of 
Haitian State University, the national point of reference. Our 
third objective is the creation of ambulatory medical assistance 
with the creation of a mobile surgery unit. [end recording]

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 17 Jun (EFE) -- In Haiti, the price 
of gasoline has fallen in the past three weeks from $10 to $6 
per gallon on the black market due to -- among other reasons -- 
contraband and, according to observers, to the considerable 
reduction of the power outages in Port-au-Prince. Some reasons 
that have contributed to the fall of fuel prices are the 
continuous smuggling of gasoline from the Dominican Republic 
and, given the restoration of electrical services, homes and 
businesses no longer are using fuel to operate their emergency 
generators. In addition, many citizens are leaving their 
vehicles at home and choosing to travel to work on public 
transportation. 
  A merchant who asked to remain anonymous told EFE: "We 
continue receiving gasoline from the Dominican Republic despite 
the total embargo decreed by the United Nations." The source 
added that although the United States is making efforts to 
enforce the embargo, "the border between both nations is very 
long and the nations are very close." 
  Vehicle traffic has been reduced considerably in 
Port-au-Prince given the closing down of public and private 
schools. Therefore, many parents do not have to transport their 
children to school. 
  Meanwhile on Thursday, William Swing, U.S. ambassador to 
Haiti, bid farewell to a group of that mission's personnel and 
their families. The officials departed from Port-au-Prince at 
the request of Washington, which has asked its citizens to leave 
Haiti. Haiti's "de facto" government declared a state of 
emergency last week.

  [Excerpt] On 16 June in the presence of journalists, the 
Haitian anti-drug service destroyed 268 kilos of cocaine from 
Colombia, intended for the U.S. market. The cocaine, seized 
during recent months by the Haitian anti-drug brigade, was 
thrown in the sea offshore by a unit of the Haitian Navy, aboard 
which were journalists and photographers who were invited to 
cover the event. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Guatemala could lose some $530 million a year from 
textile and clothing exports, if the U.S. Congress fails to 
approve President Clinton's bill granting parity to Caribbean 
Basin countries with regard to NAFTA. 
  According to a study conducted by the Secretariat of Central 
American Economic Integration [SIECA], the economies of 
Guatemala and the rest of the countries in the region would be 
severely harmed by their disadvantage with Mexico with regard to 
exports to the U.S. market. 
  Taking this into consideration, President Clinton sent to 
the 
Congress a bill detailing a "provisional trade proposal for the 
Caribbean Basin," until the countries of the region are 
completely integrated into NAFTA. 
  SIECA pointed out that investments are already being 
diverted 
to Mexico because of the country's preference within NAFTA. If 
this trend continues, the region's development would be set 
back, considering the fact that the United States is the main 
destination of exports in the area. 
  The proposal for the Caribbean Basin countries to attain 
parity with NAFTA was sent to Congress for approval, together 
with other bills related to foreign trade. For a country to 
participate in the provisional trade program, it must be free of 
charges of violations of labor and intellectual property rights 
laws. In addition, the country must not be included in the 
provisions of line 301 on restrictions on exports to the United 
States. 
  At present, Guatemala faces charges by labor unions and 
other 
U.S. organizations that the country violates labor rights, 
particularly regarding assembly plants, agriculture, and 
copyrights.

<F P=106> [Report by Carlos Castanaza] </F>
  [Text] Nearly 1,800 military men could be transferred to 
the civilian security forces once they are trained to protect 
the people, Defense Minister General Mario Rene Enriquez, said 
yesterday. 
  According to the minister, the number of police members 
should be increased, and the police have to be properly trained 
and equipped to meet society's demands for protection. 
  He also said the reorganization plan devised by the Army for 
those times when there is no counterinsurgency work to do 
includes the relocation of units. For instance, seven military 
detachments could be deployed in Peten Department to protect 
natural resources. 
  A reduction in the number of men would also improve their 
training, because for many soldiers the standard of living is 
very low, and many of them are considered needy. 
  We cannot put ourselves, however, behind many countries of 
the region. For this reason, a commission is studying the 
balance of arms. Guatemala is worse off than Honduras, El 
Salvador, Nicaragua, and even Costa Rica, because although Costa 
Rica says it does not have an army, it does possess a 
well-trained police equipped with mortars and howitzers, he said. 
  The minister believes Guatemala is ceasing to be a 
springboard for international drug trafficking. A positive sign 
is the use of drugs is not as common as in other countries. 
  We have not captured a single plane, from Colombia or 
wherever, carrying cocaine during the past few months. The drug 
capos have apparently departed for another country, he said. 
  The minister said drug trafficking continues over land and 
sea, albeit at much lower levels, as the result of the security 
forces' coordinated efforts. 
  Concerning arms trafficking, the minister said an arms cache 
recently discovered in Suchitepequez with 22 AK-47 rifles in 
perfect condition proves the URNG [National Guatemalan 
Revolutionary Unity] does not lack arms but, rather, militant 
members.

  [Text] "I give the orders here. I have the authority, and 
it is my duty to do so; it is unnecessary to look for other 
reasons because these are routine changes," said General Luis 
Alonso Discua Elvir, commander in chief of the Armed Forces, in 
angry reply to a question concerning the latest changes within 
the Armed Forces. 
  He added, quite simply, that he imparts orders because he is 
the leader of an institution that must be maintained to fulfill 
any mission that emanates from the Constitution of the Republic. 
  Gen. Discua Elvir denied that the changes in question are 
indicative of a purge or a generational struggle. He said that 
comments to this effect are made for the sole purpose of 
distracting the general public. 
  When asked why Colonel Lazaro Avila Soleno was not removed 
from his post while others were, Gen. Discua Elvir emphatically 
replied "because I am the one who imparts orders in the Armed 
Forces." 
  Meanwhile, he gave assurances that there will be no further 
changes because the changes that had to be made have been made. 
He added that there is no unrest within the Armed Forces 
because everyone knows that those who were removed had held 
their posts for over three years, and these changes are 
established in the Armed Forces Law.

<F P=106> [Report by Francisco Valeriano Giron; from "The Morning </F>
Paper" newscast] 
  [Text] After participating in the Fourth Ibero-American 
Summit of Heads of State and Government, Honduran President 
Carlos Roberto Reina returned to the country very optimistic. 
The economic arena was the predominant subject at this meeting 
of presidents. 
  President Reina said that Central America has much to gain 
and can even obtain some benefits in keeping with the other 
economic blocs that have been formed. He was asked about the 
benefits that Honduras and the Central American region, in 
particular, can obtain from this meeting and replied: 
  [Begin Reina recording] Central America's treatment in trade 
treaties vis-a-vis the other economic blocs. For example, in 
the face of NAFTA, all of Central America is endeavoring to 
obtain parity. This means that in the Caribbean Basin and in 
Central America we can achieve integration with the area that 
encompasses Mexico, the United States, and Canada. That is a 
very specific point. Another specific point is the 
capitalization of the Central American Bank of Economic 
Integration [BCIE] with extraregional partners. This will 
permit the bank to dedicate a large amount of funds to our 
country's development, affording the treatment that 
international law, trade, and integration can provide. It is an 
asymmetrical treatment. This means that the same conditions are 
not going to be required of all the partners. For example, for 
Central American products and Honduran products, particularly, 
asymmetry would mean that products that are not strictly of 
Honduran origin can leave the country, because part of the raw 
materials come from abroad. That asymmetry would help 
enormously within the old concept of Central American 
development, which is a form of balanced development. 
  This does not mean that the most developed countries are 
going to wait for the less developed. No, the development of 
the less developed countries is expedited in order to balance 
them all off later in a big push toward development. Those 
specific points are very important and very encouraging in our 
country's development. [end recording] 
  President Reina also noted that another important 
achievement 
was the fact that the BCIE achieved more capitalization through 
extraregional partners. Also, he met with Commander Fidel 
Castro. We asked him what he discussed with Castro. 
  [Begin Reina recording] It was strictly a courtesy call. I 
was accompanied by four or five persons when receiving him. Our 
talks were very general. He was very interested in learning 
about Honduras. He recalls that Jose Marti visited Honduras. 
He remembers that patriot Gomez was also in Honduras. That 
offers us the perspective that we are neighbors of Cuba at a 
time when the Inter-American system should resolve that problem. 
  I had the opportunity to present this on behalf of Central 
America. For me the case of Cuba, which has been sanctioned by 
the OAS, should be resolved within the OAS. That is the 
appropriate forum for resolving this problem. This holds true 
especially now that a great Colombian, President Cesar Gaviria, 
is now the secretary general-elect of the OAS. He can again 
provide a golden era for that continental organization, as was 
provided by his illustrious predecessor [Former Colombian 
President] Alberto Lleras Camargo. 
  Let there be no doubt, it was a courtesy visit by a chief of 
state to another chief of state on the occasion of a summit. 
Second, the solution of the Cuban problem is through the OAS. 
Those two points cover your question. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Erika Ramirez from the "National Newscast; </F>
passages in quotation marks recorded] 
  [Text] President Violeta Chamorro was visibly optimistic 
upon returning from the Fourth Ibero-American Summit in 
Cartagena, Colombia. The president said she expects good news 
from the negotiations with the consultative council in Paris. 
  President Chamorro's optimism could not be hidden. The 
Ibero-American presidents decided that countries such as 
Nicaragua should receive preferential and asymmetrical treatment 
in the integration processes. Venezuela and Colombia agreed to 
be nonregional associates of the Central American Bank of 
Economic Integration, BCIE, a decision that will increase the 
social investment funds available to fight poverty. 
  [Chamorro] "I want to tell you that Nicaragua is no longer 
disregarded. It is seen as a country living in democracy, with 
great joy, and with its head up high. I am proud that all of 
you and all Nicaraguans are cooperating for the welfare of the 
country." 
  The president told journalists that tomorrow she might 
receive good news from the consultative group in Paris. As for 
domestic topics, she talked about the criticisms that have 
emerged regarding the military law. 
  [Chamorro] "If they want to criticize it and discuss it, let 
them do it in the Assembly. That is called democracy. This 
country needs a small army and police force. We do not need 
the number of weapons we used to have. What for? Aren't we 
burning them up already? That is how I see it. Perhaps the 
next president will not want an army, but we are going to have a 
small army now." 
  As for the list of alleged companies belonging to the Army, 
she said she did not know about it but will study it tomorrow. 
She also said that Nicaragua has secular education and would 
not reform any constitutional article in this regard. 
  [Chamorro] "I am not asking anyone to attend special 
classes. 
If they want to attend those classes, they may do so. They 
also have the right to attend church and cults if they so 
desire." 
  The president pointed out that the National Assembly has the 
duty to decide if it will approve the military code and the 
constitutional reforms. She said that what she wants is mutual 
respect among government branches.

  [Text] Haitian Charge d'Affaires Georges Barberousse told 
LA PRENSA that he has confirmed during his stay in Panama that 
there is a connection between Haitian military leaders and drug 
trafficking. 
  Barberousse pointed out that Panamanian authorities recently 
seized at Coco Solo Pier, Colon, two vessels bound for 
Port-au-Prince. More than 1,000 kg of cocaine were found in the 
vessels' holds, thus revealing a criminal connection. 
  As for the sanctions adopted by the OAS against the Raul 
Cedras military regime and the Panamanian Government's 
compliance with those sanctions, the Haitian charge d'affaires 
said he had received no official notification whatsoever. 
  The diplomat added: "If this is the Panamanian Government's 
position, the embassy approves of it with satisfaction, because 
that is the kind of attitude the international community is 
taking to solve the Haitian crisis." 
  Questioned on the imminent military invasion of his country, 
just as happened in Panama, Barberousse emphasized that the 
official position of Jean-Bertand Aristide's government's is not 
to support a military incursion in Haiti, but he understands the 
Panamanians' position on the issue. 
  The Haitian official also said that now is not the time for 
a 
military invasion but for the implementation of peaceful 
measures to settle disputes. That is the path that the 
international community is taking, thereby coinciding with the 
interests of the constitutional government. 
  Barberousse said: "What we really want is for the Haitian 
military to leave power, and that is what we are aiming for 
through the implementation of sanctions, which, we hope, will 
become more effective every day." 
  As for Panama, he reported that the Haitian Embassy this 
week 
sent a note to the Panamanian Foreign Ministry requesting a 
meeting with the foreign minister to discuss the implementation 
of sanctions and the cooperation the Panamanian Government has 
offered Haitians so far.

  [Text] Designated Foreign Minister Gabriel Lewis Galindo, 
who leaves the country on a 15-day vacation today, revealed 
yesterday that Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez will meet 
with Panamanian President-Elect Ernesto Perez Balladares in 
Madrid, Spain, on 10 July, when the latter starts an official 
four-day visit in that country. 
  The possibility of Spanish investments in Panama, support 
for 
the tourism program to be implemented by the new Panamanian 
Government, and other economic and social issues are part of the 
agenda to be discussed by Perez Balladares and Gonzalez, Lewis 
Galindo reported. He also said the banana issue will not be 
absent even though it is well-known that this is a very complex 
problem and could never be resolved during this trip. 
  "The main purpose of this visit to Spain is to look for a 
rapprochement with Panama's traditional friends, such as the 
Spaniards and especially their president, Felipe Gonzalez," 
Lewis Galindo stated. 
  The designated foreign minister, however, did not reject the 
possibility that the Democratic Revolutionary Party will make 
efforts to be reinstated into the Socialist International [SI], 
an organization of political parties with a great deal of 
prestige. Felipe Gonzalez is one of the SI's most important 
leaders. 
  He added that President Perez Balladares will be accompanied 
by designated Planning Minister Guillermo Chapman, designated 
Presidency Minister Raul Arango, designated State Security 
Minister Jose Luis Sosa, former President Aristides Royo, and 
Mario Velasquez, the president-elect's spokesman.

<F P=106> [Report by Hermes Sucre Serrano] </F>
  [Text] The Christian Democratic Party [PDC] faction last 
night dashed the hopes of its traditional opponent, the 
Democratic Revolutionary Party [PRD], for having an amnesty bill 
for political offenses pass the Legislative Assembly. The bill 
was defeated in a third debate by a 28-to-11 vote, while 11 
abstained. 
  The bill, which was passed in a second debate on Monday, was 
defeated by an overwhelming majority after the PDC faction 
requested a recess so its members could agree on what to do in 
view of the imminent approval of the bill. 
  The legislators who abstained include Guillermo Cochez, 
Alfredo Ehlers, Alcibiades Alvarado, Jose Hill, Gloria Moreno de 
Lopez, Luis Narvaez, Elba Aizpurua, Benito Vega, Julio Velarde, 
and Enrique Degracia. 
  Those who opposed the bill said it was the PRD legislators 
themselves who secured its defeat by insisting on including in 
Article 1 a clause exempting from culpability all those who 
perpetrate offenses "through actions for political purposes." 
PDC Representative Raul Ossa said that the PRD criticized the 
very nature of the proposed amnesty by attempting to leave "a 
loophole" to legalize the ill-gotten fortunes and the homicides 
perpetrated by Manuel Antonio Noriega and his followers, who 
undoubtedly were engaged in political activities. 
  Ossa said that, in view of the failure of the PRD trick, 
President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares as of 1 September will 
have to go ahead and declare an amnesty that will benefit 
everyone. "They will have to face the consequences of such a 
move," he said. 
  Alonso Fernandez, of Molirena [Nationalist Republican 
Liberal 
Movement] who, together with fellow party member Arturo 
Vallarino, proposed the bill, said this rejection is an assembly 
"blunder" and that it represents a new frustration for the 
families of political prisoners who had set their hopes on an 
amnesty law. In addition, PRD Representative Alberto Aleman 
Boyd said that the Legislative Assembly last night went from 
"the sublime to the ridiculous" and that it is not interested in 
reconciliation but revenge. 
  PRD President Gerardo Gonzalez said that the rejection has 
opened a "Pandora's box," which will bring to light the whole 
gamut of offenses committed by the current government which, 
"with the support of the U.S. personnel carriers," has 
perpetrated all types of injustices against those who deserve to 
be pardoned. 
  Gloria Moreno de Lopez, former PDC leader, said that, 
although she had earlier backed an amnesty law that specified 
the names of those who would benefit from it, she will never 
support a proposal in favor of those who perpetrated all kinds 
of abuses and who could be released by invoking the phrase 
"acting for political purposes." 
  Furthermore, PRD's Franklyn Rivera said that it never 
crossed 
the minds of those who rejected the amnesty bill last night that 
in the assembly there are legislators involved in crimes, who 
receive salaries from several institutions, have profited from 
reverted properties, are involved in attempted rapes, and in the 
future will have to account for these crimes. 
  Alberto Cigarruista, of the Authentic Liberal Party, 
dismissed the PRD threats and reaffirmed his position that 
everyone guilty of common crimes, including members of the 
Guillermo Endara administration, should end up behind bars.

  [Text] President Guillermo Endara continues his visit to 
Argentina. Last night Argentine President Carlos Menem hosted a 
dinner in his honor at the presidential palace. Today (Juan 
Bautista Joffre), former Argentine ambassador to Panama, will 
host a luncheon for the Panamanian president. This evening 
Endara will attend a tango musical performance in the 
traditional San Telmo neighborhood. 
  Meanwhile, during statements to local media in Argentina, 
President Endara said that he agreed with the Legislative 
Assembly's rejection of the draft amnesty bill. Endara said that 
the manner in which this draft bill has been presented provided 
a wide loophole through which many criminals could escape.

  [Excerpt] New York, 17 Jun (AFP-NA) -- Emilio Cardenas, 
Argentina's ambassador to the United Nations, said on 17 June 
that Argentina has expressed its "total support" for the French 
humanitarian military operation in Rwanda to put an end to the 
killing of civilians in that African country, but it will not 
participate in the operation with troops. 
  "The French mission has humanitarian characteristics and for 
that reason it is supported by Argentina," Cardenas said after a 
UN Security Council consultation meeting. 
  The ambassador did not rule out, however, his country's 
participation with a logistics contribution. Cardenas explained 
that Argentina could not send troops because it has reached the 
"practical ceiling" with its participation in UN peacekeeping 
operations. 
  Regarding the logistics support, "the only thing we can do 
is 
move the hospital operating in Mozambique with the commitment 
that it will stay in Rwanda only after 15 November. We could 
consider moving the hospital to Rwanda, but only after that 
date," Cardenas added. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 16 Jun (EFE) -- Court sources reported 
today that Peruvian citizen Jorge Diaz Reategui, who was 
detained a week ago in the Argentine city of Tucuman, has 
admitted being a former member of the Shining Path [SL] Maoist 
group. 
  In a joint operation on 9 June, Tucuman police and Argentine 
Federal Police detained Diaz Reategui, 36, at a hotel in 
Tucuman, 1,412 km northwest of Buenos Aires. He had been meeting 
with 10 fellow countrymen, who managed to escape. 
  Tucuman Federal Judge Ricardo Maturana, who is hearing the 
case, asked the Interpol office in Peru to deny or confirm Diaz 
Reategui's testimony. 
  The sources noted: "Diaz Reategui coordinated his visit with 
his followers. They probably crossed the border on forged 
certificates of residence and visas from Paraguay to Argentina, 
via Buenos Aires, from where they traveled to other provincial 
capitals like Cordoba, Jujuy, Salta, and Tucuman." 
  The court sources added that the Peruvian Upper Huallaga 
region, where the former Shining Path member was operating, "is 
a region where the world's largest coca plantations exist, a 
region where cocaine paste is processed and subsequently refined 
for marketing by the Colombian `cartels.'" 
  The Argentine Federal Police Press Division added that the 
Shining Path cell, of which Diaz Reategui was a member, "had 
been tracked for about one year." 
  The Tucuman police are still tracking the other 10 people 
who 
accompanied Diaz Reategui on the day of his arrest and are 
attempting to determine what the former Shining Path member and 
his followers were doing in Tucuman and in other provinces.

<F P=106> [Interview with Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo by CLARIN </F>
reporter Maria Laura Avignolo at the Imperial Hotel The Regent 
in London on 9 June] 
  [Text] [Avignolo] Why are you travelling abroad so often of 
late to explain the economic program? 
  [Cavallo] Because we consider that direct foreign investment 
in Argentina is of paramount importance. There has been an 
inflow of foreign capital into our country and we want that to 
continue. It is very important that the Argentine companies that 
place shares and bonds on foreign markets have a good reception. 
To this end, one must not only explain the virtues of each 
company in particular but also the country's overall situation. 
Institutions first assess the country where they want to invest 
to measure the level of "risk" involved and then make estimates. 
Only when the country is rated as eligible do they look into 
each company. We have the responsibility of keeping the 
country's foreign credit open not for the government but rather 
for Argentine companies. 
  [Avignolo] The events that took place in Chiapas have cast a 
shadow on Latin American countries; what can you tell those who 
say that a situation similar to that in Chiapas may take place 
in Argentina? 
  [Cavallo] The riots in Santiago del Estero Province occurred 
before Chiapas. The media reported about Chiapas and Santiago 
del Estero as two examples of social upheavals allegedly sparked 
to protest adjustment programs. We said the state of unrest in 
Argentina was to protest local authorities' corrupt practices 
and inefficiency. This was proven in the last elections. The 
federal trustee managed to redress an adverse situation in four 
months and the Justicialist Party won the elections. 
  In Argentina, there may be strikes and protest rallies here 
and there like in any other country in the world, but we do not 
foresee a situation that would lead to an armed uprising similar 
to the one in Chiapas. 
  [Avignolo] If you are not afraid of a possible Chiapas, why 
are you in favor of establishing a security secretariat? 
  [Cavallo] The idea was not to establish a security 
secretariat but rather to divide the Interior Ministry into two 
functions. The first person I heard talk about this idea was 
Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf, who was the one who presented 
it. Then [President Carlos] Menem wanted to implement it. It was 
not my idea but the president's, based on an initiative by the 
interior minister himself. Hence, all this fuss about my 
proposing it is just a groundless invention. But I think it 
would be quite good to have two ministries--one that would be in 
charge of political relations with provincial governments and 
another one in charge of domestic security. 
  [Avignolo] There are many rumors about the president's poor 
health. Have foreign investors asked you about this? 
  [Cavallo] Nobody has asked me about the president's health. 
In my opinion, he looks very well and healthy and is always in a 
good mood. I do not know where those rumors came from. I have 
read magazines that discussed this issue, but I see him nearly 
every day and he looks absolutely normal. I think that is pure 
invention. 
  [Avignolo] The trade deficit grew 378 percent in the first 
four months of the year. Is this not putting the feasibility of 
your plan in jeopardy? 
  [Cavallo] No, on the contrary. It is a symptom of health. 
The 
deficit in the current account of the balance of payments is due 
to the considerable inflow of capital by those interested in 
investing in our country. This has occurred in the first quarter 
of the year compared with the same period in 1993. A country in 
which there are major investments on account of the inflow of 
capital must of necessity import many capital goods. 
  [Avignolo] Are you not going to take measures in light of 
the 
massive import drive in Argentina? 
  [Cavallo] No, because imports of capital goods are the ones 
that are increasing the most. We want to have a high level of 
investment in our country. 
  [Avignolo] Can the trade deficit affect the parity of 
exchange between the peso and the dollar? 
  [Cavallo] No. The certainty concerning the exchange rate and 
the economy's progress is precisely what fosters the inflow of 
capital and high levels of investment. The fact that we pegged 
the peso to the dollar has been instrumental in creating a 
climate of confidence and as long as it is maintained--and I 
hope it will be for a long, long time--there will be a high 
level of investment. If we attract considerable domestic 
savings, they will be financed with domestic savings. Otherwise, 
as long as investments are financed with foreign savings, there 
will be a trade deficit in Argentine accounts. However, the fact 
that there is a deficit does not necessarily mean it is a 
negative thing. 
  [Avignolo] But hasn't the inflow of foreign capital slowed 
over the last few months? 
  [Cavallo] No, it has increased. Nevertheless, the cost of 
the 
funds may have been higher. The balance of trade deficit is an 
estimate of the inflow of foreign capital. 
  [Avignolo] Is the Argentine Government afraid of taking 
measures against dumping [preceding word in English] as other 
countries do? 
  [Cavallo] No, we do apply them. What happens is that we 
rigorously follow the procedures allowed by GATT. We are 
organizing the system dealing with subsidies and measures 
against dumping in a very efficient way because previous 
administrations just resorted to devaluing the peso or banning 
imports. 
  [Avignolo] Do bankers ask you whether the peso will be 
devalued? 
  [Cavallo] They did not ask me that until last year because 
it 
is clear that markets in Argentina are not expecting any 
devaluation. It is worth comparing the evolution of interest 
rates in pesos in Argentina and in Mexico. While over the last 
few weeks, interest rates in pesos have increased quite sharply 
in Mexico, they have been maintained at a stable level in 
Argentina and neither Chiapas nor the murder of [Institutional 
Revolutionary Party presidential candidate Luis Donaldo] Colosio 
or the drop in U.S. interest rates have had any bearing on them. 
This means that there is no expectation of a devaluation of the 
peso in Argentina as is the case in Mexico. Bankers have become 
aware that Argentina has a very special monetary system.

  [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 15 Jun (NA) -- Catamarca municipal 
workers were involved in serious incidents outside the 
provincial government house today. The demonstrators said they 
would take over the city hall building tomorrow unless they 
receive their May salaries. Meanwhile, the tense situation 
continues in Salta and Santiago del Estero. 
  In Catamarca, municipal workers protested outside government 
house, city hall, and the legislature. They lit fires with the 
garbage that has accumulated in the streets as a consequence of 
the indefinite garbage workers strike that started on 14 June. 
[passage omitted] 
  The fires made aerosol cans explode. The fire damaged the 
government house main door before firefighters arrived. Police 
and border police agents confronted the demonstrators to prevent 
serious incidents. [passage omitted] 
  A large percentage of public workers continued their "work 
to 
rule" today, a measure they will continue until they receive 
their May salaries. 
  The protest has virtually paralyzed the provincial public 
administration. It includes assemblies and rallies in work areas 
to demand their back salaries. [passage omitted] 
  In Salta, public workers went on strike and mobilized in 
front of the provincial legislature demanding a basic salary of 
500 pesos. 
  Miguel Quiroga, ATE-Salta [Association of State 
Workers-Salta] social action secretary, said the protest "seeks 
the payment of salaries on time because health workers and 
pensioners did not receive their salaries yet." 
  In Santiago del Estero, the State Unions Front organized a 
rally for tonight. The rally follows a strike involving teachers 
and judicial branch workers that is being widely observed. 
  The strike was to protest the transfer of the pensions fund 
to the nation, to demand an emergency salary increase, and 
against the policy of privatizations announced by Federal 
Trustee Juan Scharetti.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 17 Jun (NA) -- The bloc of Socialist 
Unity (US) deputies has presented a draft resolution proposing 
the impeachment of President of the Republic Carlos Menem for 
the alleged crime of "misconduct in office." 
  Hector Polino, the U.S. deputy for the federal capital, 
sponsored the resolution. He explained that the petition is 
based "on the liberal use of emergency decrees" by the executive 
branch "and a wide variety of anticonstitutional decrees with 
which Congress is being overwhelmed." 
  Concerning the latter point, the socialist legislator 
emphasized "the liberal use of illegal legislative delegate 
powers and the practice of partial promulgations of bills that 
have been approved by Congress and then partially or totally 
vetoed by the executive branch." 
  Polino stressed: "Decree No. 660, eliminating a dollar 
guarantee established by the retirement law for those joining 
the National Bank's AFJP [Retirement and Pension Fund Managing 
Companies], is among the 310 emergency decrees that President 
Menem has issued since July 1989."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 17 Jun (NA) -- The government has 
presented a mining update and mining environmental protection 
bill, eliminating the state monopoly on radioactive minerals and 
providing a legislative framework for environmental reclamation 
in a highly contaminating activity. 
  In addition to ending the state monopoly on the mining and 
marketing of radioactive minerals that has been in effect since 
1956, the bill is aimed at changing about 20 National Mining 
Code articles. 
  Upon presenting the bill, Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo 
emphasized the significance of adjusting the legislation that 
governs this activity in order to facilitate investment in an 
area that requires significant capital. 
  Cavallo said: "More than 60 large international companies, 
which committed themselves to investing $1.5 billion, have been 
establishing themselves in our country." 
  Concerning this data, the minister noted: "This is the best 
way of promoting the development of regional economies." 
  The ceremony to present the bill was held on 16 June in the 
Economy Ministry's Padilla Hall. Present at the ceremony were 
Mining Secretary Eduardo Angel Mazza and Natural Resources and 
Environment Secretary Maria Julia Alsogaray. 
  Manuel Mondino, the National Commission for Atomic Energy 
(CNEA) chairman, was invited to the ceremony but sent a letter 
expressing his support for the bill. 
  During the ceremony, Mazza was the only official who 
addressed, although superficially, the significance of 
eliminating the state monopoly on uranium and thorium. 
  Concerning this point, the mining secretary merely admitted: 
"It is a very sensitive issue." He emphasized: "We have the 
CNEA's agreement." 
  For her part, engineer Alsogaray ended her brief speech by 
emphasizing: "Environmental problems cannot be solved unless 
economic factors are correctly interpreted." 
  Despite the removal of the current monopoly on nuclear 
elements, the state, through the CNEA, will police and monitor 
these activities and advise provincial organizations. 
  The companies interested in mining activities will present 
an 
environmental impact statement in order to receive an 
Environmental Certificate for a period established by this law's 
regulations. The Environment Certificate will be issued by the 
appropriate provincial authorities. 
  In addition, those who will exploit mines with radioactive 
minerals will present a program on the reclamation of the 
natural areas effected by the waste material.

  [Text] Government Minister German Quiroga has reported that 
the U.S. Government has extended once again the deadline for 
eradicating 5,000 hectares of coca and 20,000 square meters of 
coca nurseries, this time until September 1994. 
  Quiroga explained that once the commitment is signed, 
Washington will disburse the $20 million aid for the local 
balance of payment. 
  Quiroga explained that thanks to the government 
negotiations, 
it was possible to get the U.S. to extend the deadline. 
  Quiroga recalled that once the 31 March 1994 deadline 
expired, the Bolivian Government began negotiations to have it 
extended until next September. 
  Quiroga also explained that the conditions established by 
the 
U.S. Government are not mandatory for the government. 
  He added: "We either accept the resources and carry out the 
policy or we simply do not accept it and we do not carry it out."

  [Excerpts] La Paz, 7 Jun (LOS TIEMPOS) -- Approximately 
20,000 peasants--some 20 percent of the coca growers of the 
Cochabamba tropical region and La Paz department--today 
expressed their willingness "to replace coca with other 
products" on condition the government carries out, in the short 
term, "effective alternative development plans" in the 
production zones. 
  Several coca growers' leaders told LOS TIEMPOS that their 
unions "will do this if the Government Ministry and the Social 
Defense Secretariat" fulfill their commitments with the peasants. 
  The union leader said: "They just make promises but have 
done 
nothing to carry out the projects and works established in the 
agreements and documents signed with officials in March and May 
of this year." [passage omitted] 
  The government announced recently that at least $600 million 
has been invested in alternative development plans in the 
Chapare region of Cochabamba and the Yungas region of La Paz. 
  The official spokesmen added that only about 10 percent [as 
published] of that amount--about $100 million--has "really" been 
used in projects to replace coca. 
  The coca leaders added that most of the plans "failed, to 
the 
misfortune of the peasants and the country."

  [Text] La Paz, 6 Jun (JATHA) -- The coca growers who said 
the government spent $100 million on alternative development in 
the last 10 years came out short in their estimate when the 
government disclosed that it spent $207 million on that project 
in the last 10 years. 
  This information was provided by Social Defense Secretary 
Mario Soliz who invited the media to visit the Chapare "to see 
what had been done with that money, projects such as 
electrification, roads, health clinics, schools, etc." 
  In view of the doubt emerging about the multimillion dollar 
investment and the "great projects" carried out in the last 10 
years, Soliz said: "As in any operation some mistakes were made, 
wrong criteria were used but we cannot deny the existence of 
alternative development because of that." The questions were 
asked by the coca growers who recently said through their 
leaders that coca replacement or agricultural conversion should 
have been done on the 26,000 hectares that were voluntarily 
eradicated in the tropical region of Cochabamba. 
  But according to the technical reports of the institutions 
in 
charge of carrying out alternative development such as PDAR 
[Alternative Development Program], the IBTA [Bolivian Institute 
of Nuclear Science and Technology] of the Chapare, and the 
United Nations, coca replacement was only done on 2,000 hectares. 
  Leader Felipe Caceres said: "This means that 24,000 hectares 
are full of weeds while the peasants who eradicated coca from 
them are bankrupt, without work, and sometimes forced to get 
involved in illegal activities." 
  Were those $207 million really invested in the Chapare? 
asked 
Secretary Soliz again today. His response was: "Yes, the records 
and the evaluation made by the organizations involved in the 
program show they were." 
  But the coca growers said the majority of the organizations 
involved in alternative development spent more money on paying 
their employees' salaries and travelling expenses than on the 
projects themselves. 
  Soliz replied that paying salaries is part of the work on 
alternative development. 
  Soliz said that because there are different criteria, 
peasant 
leaders have been invited to participate in or become members of 
the executive board of the Fonadal [National Fund for 
Alternative Development]. 
  He added: "This is how they will be able to check the 
projects, and express their opinions which is something that was 
not done in the past. But from now on they will be the main 
participants in this process." 
  Government Minister German Quiroga said that in the last 10 
years more investments have been made in alternative development 
than in any other Latin American country and this is "a 
demonstration that alternative development was made and will 
continue to be made." 
  Quiroga added that this at least "shows that the government 
struggle is not against coca growers but against those who use 
coca to make other products."

  [Text] Deputy Guido Camacho, chairman of the Drug 
Trafficking Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, said yesterday 
the government is "openly biased" toward U.S. interests over the 
drug enforcement policy. He demanded a new bilateral agreement 
to preserve the interests of coca farmers. 
  Camacho said it is the duty of the executive branch to 
maintain an atmosphere of peace and to meet the needs of all 
social classes of the country. 
  "I see the government is currently openly biased toward U.S. 
Government interests, thus forgetting its duty to solve the 
problems of coca farmers," Camacho said. 
  Camacho thus replied when asked about future negotiations 
between the Bolivian Government and the U.S. Embassy on drug 
enforcement once the agreement signed during the administration 
of former President Jaime Paz Zamora expires. 
  He said he believes the elimination of excess coca crops in 
the Chapare region is more of a priority for the United States 
than for Bolivia. 
  "Eradication must consider not only the exchange of money 
for 
each hectare of illegal coca. We need comprehensive solutions to 
the social problems of thousands of families in coca-producing 
areas." 
  He said coca eradication must not create social or economic 
problems for large sectors of the Bolivian population. This 
depends on the government's ability to negotiate a new agreement 
for the eradication of illegal coca crops.

  [Text] Tarija -- The 10th Workers Congress that probably 
will end in the next few hours has defended coca crops and 
demanded the industrialization of this controversial leaf that, 
according to peasants, is constantly threatened by foreign 
interests. 
  Thus, the Workers Congress passed a resolution condemning 
the 
"merciless intervention of North American troops in the coca 
zones, openly ignoring our national sovereignty." 
  For Bolivia, coca is not cocaine; it is a natural product 
and 
resource that is part of the Bolivian national culture and must 
be defended by endorsing its industrialization and 
decriminalization. 
  According to the workers, coca must be defended as part of 
the cultural patrimony of the region's countries. The labor 
representatives expressed their wish to internationally 
decriminalize this Peruvian and Bolivian leaf. 
  Activities by nongovernment organizations (NGO's) in the 
coca-producing areas were harshly criticized by the labor 
representatives, who demanded their expulsion because these 
NGO's want to divide the strong coca farmers' movement. 
  The resolution approved by the Workers Congress calls for 
the 
total implementation of alternative development programs because 
they are considered a serious method to replace the coca economy. 
  The Chapare, a controversial region as a result of the 
presence of coca and drug trafficking, was declared a national 
emergency zone to safeguard a possible militarization of the 
area on the pretext of replacing the coca economy. 
  The workers also asked that peasant markets depend directly 
on peasant organizations. Peasant representatives also expressed 
their concern at the lack of roads.

  [Text] Facts on 8 June proved the existence of a political 
agreement between the MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary Left] 
and the MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement] in the 
narcolinks [alleged MIR involvement with drug traffickers] 
investigations. The politicians involved later secretly 
confirmed the agreement. The details of this agreement, which is 
beginning to yield results, remain unknown. 
  MIR legislators told HOY about the agreement with the MNR 
for 
the purpose of obtaining a "lenient report" regarding the 
"narcolinks" subject in exchange for support to impeach two 
Supreme Court justices. 
  Two legislators, who asked not to be identified, said they 
were "disappointed" with the development of the investigation 
that, according to them, was supposed to "clearly determine" 
that the MIR leaders charged with being involved with drug 
traffickers were not guilty. 
  Moreover, MBL [Free Bolivia Movement] Deputy Juan del 
Granado 
admitted the existence of "regretful evidence that nonlegal 
matters related to the impeachment process are being used" in 
the "narcolinks" investigations currently under way. 
  The agreement, which was a mere rumor until now, became 
obvious on 8 June when MIR Senators Leopoldo Lopez, Jose Luis 
Carvajal, and Gonzalo Valda reappeared at the impeachment 
sessions despite their announcement that they would not even 
endorse it with their presence. 
  What is more, MIR Deputy Hugo Carvajal announced that his 
party would vote in favor of sentencing the court justices. 
  Moreover, a few hours later, MIR legislators approved the 
education reform bill that had been approved by the Chamber of 
Deputies, after voting against it in previous sessions. 
  According to MIR leaders, the narcolinks subject "was 
handled 
shamefully" through an agreement whose details still are unknown. 
  According to Deputy del Granado, one of the main 
protagonists 
of the investigation, there are clues that lead one to believe 
in the existence of some sort of agreement between the MNR and 
the MIR. 
  Among them, he mentioned the delay in drafting the final 
report, which should have been ready several days ago, but oddly 
enough is constantly postponed. Del Granado said: "This is very 
suspicious." 
  Del Granado said that in addition to this, there is the 
little conviction shown by Senator Gonzalo Valda when he sought 
an injunction preventing the enforcement of Resolution 113-94 
allowing the alternate senators to occupy the seats of those 
senators objected to by [Supreme Court Justices Ernesto] Poppe 
and [Edgar] Oblitas' defense. 
  There is also a numeric issue that would "justify" a MNR-MIR 
agreement. Two-thirds of the Senate's votes--18--are necessary 
to condemn the court justices. Since the governing coalition 
does not have that number of votes, the announcement by Carvajal 
could be feasible. 
  Although the agreement's exact terms have not been leaked, 
sources consulted by HOY said it is allegedly designed on one 
hand to obtain the most lenient report possible on the 
"narcolinks," and the MIR in exchange would give its support to 
the impeachment process, the education reform bill's approval, 
and constitutional reform. 
  When asked about the subject, Condepa [Conscience of the 
Fatherland] leader Carlos Palenque said: "It would be terrible 
for democracy and the political organizations involved."

  [Excerpt] MBL [Free Bolivia Movement] Deputy Erwin Saucedo 
warned on 9 June that the MBL will leave the government if the 
political "agreement" is confirmed between the MIR [Movement of 
the Revolutionary Left] and the MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary 
Movement] to exclude some MIR leaders from the final report by 
the Constitution Committee on the so-called "narcolinks" case 
[between the MIR and drug traffickers during Paz Zamora's 
government]. 
  The MBL deputy confirmed his position, stating that his 
party 
had decided to participate in the current government based on 
the MNR's conviction to fight corruption in all its forms and 
not to conceal such phenomenon that ruled the behavior of 
several leaders of the defunct Patriotic Accord. 
  "I think this is a subject that can break an accord (between 
the MBL and the MIR). If there are agreements and collusions not 
to fight corruption or if reports on the political settlements 
are confirmed, we will review the accord," Saucedo said. 
  The MBL deputy then reaffirmed his party's decision to begin 
an impeachment process against former President Jaime Paz Zamora 
if it is established that he had a criminal relationship with 
presumed drug trafficker Isaac "Oso" Chavarria. 
  However, the MBL deputy did not limit himself to that 
warning, but added that MIR congressmen, Constitution Committee 
members Edil Sandoval and Oliverio Iriarte, cannot throw 
overboard a serious work developed within that committee to find 
the truth about the "narcolinks." 
  Saucedo's concern stems from reports that meetings were held 
several days ago between MIR and MNR members in an effort to 
exclude former President Jaime Paz Zamora from the final 
Constitution Committee report in exchange for support of the 
government by the three MIR senators in the impeachment process 
against the Supreme Court justices. 
  It also was said that one of the meetings was reportedly 
held 
over the past weekend at the house of Senate President Juan 
Carlos Duran and that MIR bloc leader Carlos Borth was present 
at that meeting. [passage omitted]

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Bolivia monitored through 16 
June. 
  The Central Bank reported that net international reserves 
were $498 million through May, the highest in the past few 
years. The reserves have risen $37.2 million so far this year, 
an increase of 10 percent compared with December 1993, and $22.2 
million in May, an increase of 5.75 percent. The level of 
reserves has been positive in all months except for January. 
(Santa Cruz EL MUNDO in Spanish 25 May 94 National Section p 1) 
  Finance Secretary Gaby Candia reported that public 
investments totalled $60 million in the year's first quarter, 10 
percent of the amount projected for this year. She explained 
that this conservative disbursement was caused by the late 
approval of the general budget. A total of $566 million was 
approved for the current public investment program, an increase 
of 18 percent compared with 1993. According to official reports, 
52 percent will be invested in economic development, 44 percent 
in human development, and 3.2 percent in sustainable 
development. This program seeks to guarantee an economic growth 
of 4 percent with projects to improve the economic 
infrastructure. La Paz accounts for 23.2 percent of the 
investments; Santa Cruz 22.7 percent, and Cochabamba 22.7 
percent. (Santa Cruz EL MUNDO in Spanish 25 May 94 National 
Section p 1) 
  A record monthly stock exchange operation of $100.2 million 
was registered in the Bolivian Stock Exchange Market late in 
May. It rose $36.1 million compared with April, an increase of 
58 percent. (La Paz LA RAZON in Spanish 4 Jun 94 p B4)

  [Text] Havana, 15 Jun (EFE) -- Brazil has purchased 7.5 
million dose of vaccines to control a meningitis outbreak in Rio 
de Janeiro. This information was released today by Gustavo 
Sierra, vice president of the "Carlos J. Finlay" institute, 
which produces the vaccines. 
  Sierra said: "Everything will be better now because there is 
the idea of organizing a program for fighting the outbreaks and 
even for steady use of the vaccine." 
  He added: "This order opens a new stage in the use of Cuban 
vaccines in Brazil, where they will be used for controlling a 
meningitis outbreak in Rio de Janeiro." 
  Gustavo Sierra, who heads the National Group for Human and 
Animal Vaccines, said the vaccines are sold practically all over 
Latin America, where they are in various phases of use, medical 
registration, or distribution. 
  He reported that approximately 10 million doses of vaccines 
have been exported so far, adding that if the vaccines are 
properly used in a program, they can not only control outbreaks 
but even the disease itself in the long term. 
  The "Finlay" institute will advise the Brazilian state of 
Rio 
de Janeiro in a $325 million "technology transfer" project that 
will permit local laboratories to produce the vaccine developed 
by Cuban scientists for controlling meningitis. 
  According to sources in Rio de Janeiro's Secretariat of 
Industry and Commerce, the state government is planning to 
create a mixed enterprise for selling the vaccine and for 
vaccinating some 5 million people under 14 before 1995.

<F P=106> [From "Notes and Information" page, editorial: "Economic </F>
Terrorism Under Way"] 
  [Text] Much of the unrest in the market and among those who 
seriously worry about the future of Brazilian economy should not 
be attributed just to President Itamar Franco's 
re-implementation of old habits. The president is partly 
responsible, perhaps more than partly because he heads the 
government, but to his excellency's responsibility should be 
added that of those -- in Congress or in sectors of the 
bureaucratic machinery -- who wish to reattribute to the public 
sector its former prevalence over the private sector. It is 
this wish that explains the campaign, which we could call a form 
of terrorism, that has just begun to take shape and will reach a 
climax during the period immediately preceding and following the 
implementation of the real. 
  The executive branch views entrepreneurs as people who evade 
taxes, create cartels, and abusively increases prices. To fight 
tax evasion, the government uses the Federal Revenue Department, 
the behavior of which clearly reflects the mentality of the 
highest bureaucratic spheres of Brasilia: A tax collection goal 
has been established, and it must be achieved at any price. 
Control was first intensified, and there is nothing wrong with 
that; on the contrary. As this was not strong enough and the 
current laws -- no matter how strict or lax -- did not achieve 
the desired target, a provisional measure was drafted to 
transform what was a crime into a tort [ilicito civil]. This 
provisional measure also established that those who collect 
taxes or social contributions and who subsequently do not 
transfer them to the Treasury or the Social Security Ministry 
will be sentenced to 90 days in jail. Fear of being arrested, 
however, probably will not result in increased revenues. The 
government now wishes to make credit and debt operations a 
triangular operation: If A has a debt with the Federal Treasury 
and is owed some money by B, the Treasury will approach B and 
collect some of what he owes A. It is not important if this 
procedure clashes with the Fiscal Code or with good sense in 
general. It does not matter if this move removes B's 
"privilege" of not paying his debt to A on the day it becomes 
due or if it extracts the resources A needs to finance his 
company, the Federal Revenue department has money to collect 
from A and will get it from B. Legally, everything is resolved 
through the provisional measure, which Congress will not bother 
to analyze because of its total lack of interest. The 
provisional measure will be redrafted as many times as the 
president and the Federal Revenue Department deem necessary. 
This is "Itamar's popular democracy." 
  Control on economic activities is becoming stricter by the 
day. The recently sanctioned Antitrust Law has been defended as 
not having introduced anything new. It merely consolidates 
current laws, seeking to ensure free competition. It just so 
happens, however, that Delegated Law Number 4 and Law 8880/94 
(which created the Real Value Unit -- URV) were not revoked. 
Both these laws prevent infractions against the economic order. 
The result of all that is that the Cade [Administrative council 
for Economic Defense] is preparing to control oligopolies (a key 
word meaning activity against the people). It is also preparing 
to order the Sunab [National Supply Superintendency] to strictly 
enforce the law against store owners. The campaign slogan is a 
war against "abusive prices," the exact meaning of which no one 
seems to know, and the definition of which cannot be found in 
any law. The closest the government has come to explaining the 
characteristics of this "crime" is contained in an article of 
Law 8880, which states: "It is deemed abusive to unjustifiably 
increase prices to a level where the price equivalent in URV's 
is greater than the average increase registered from September 
to December 1993." Thus, the plan that did not freeze prices 
will punish those who cannot explain why their prices have gone 
up. Bureaucrats are not concerned about "unjustified 
increases," they are only concerned about "abusive increases" 
which can only be identified after comparing the current price 
to the September/December average price. To do so, no cost 
analysis is conducted. In other words, despite all that is 
being said about the market law, prices will remain frozen until 
guidelines to clarify this policy are released. 
  Worse still is the government definition of an oligopoly. 
The executive branch believes an oligopoly is synonymous of a 
cartel and a situation where competition among companies that 
work in an area of business simply does not exist. A 
disinformation campaign against oligopolies has been continuing 
since [former] President Collor's installation. As a result, 
oligopolies have become cartels in all areas where there is no 
competition. The Cade will focus on those oligopolies and on 
the companies of the "highest concentration sectors." These two 
types of companies will not be allowed to increase their June 
prices beyond the September/December average. If they are lucky, 
their managers will manage to justify increases. If bureaucracy 
spots them, however, they will be charged with infractions 
against the economic order, fined, and forced to comply with the 
rules or run the risk of facing a warrant for preventive arrest. 
When the Real Plan is effectively implemented, Sunab and Cade 
will pursue those who abuse the people's patience -- and all 
this will happen without a price freeze and in the defense of 
free competition. This is just one more aspect of "Itamar's 
popular democracy," which is closing in on "speculators..."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Control of Prices and Investment"] </F>
  [Text] It is necessary to create jobs, but to this end it 
is necessary to have capital, which we do not yet have in 
sufficient quantity for accelerated growth. The only solution 
for resolving this problem is to make use of foreign savings -- 
not in the form of loans attracted by interest rates that are 
much higher than in other markets, but in the form of direct 
investment, which brings not only the funds for creating jobs 
but the technology with which it is possible to face 
international competition. Now the first result of the law on 
the so-called abuse of economic power will be to push foreign 
capital away from our country. 
  So far the strongest obstacle to foreign capital has been a 
very high inflation rate and protectionism, which impeded 
production under the proper conditions. We liberalized our 
economy, and in some sectors it was possible to reduce domestic 
prices by importing modern components that made it possible for 
us to compete abroad, streamlining production costs. The Real 
Plan has brought hope for the return of a "civilized" inflation 
rate. We can hope to once again receive foreign investment, 
which in recent years has dropped remarkably. Yet Congress has 
just approved an antitrust law that actually seeks to reinstate 
a price control system that is even more harmful than direct 
control, because it produces uncertainty. Under such conditions 
the country will push foreign capital even farther away. In 
order to attract foreign capital, Brazil has for several years 
been said to have -- unlike other countries -- a large potential 
domestic market. It so happens that this advantage is 
disappearing with the creation of Mercosur [Common Market of the 
South], as foreign investors can settle in one of the other 
Mercosur signatory countries, which sooner or later will be 
joined by Chile, in order to conquer the Brazilian market. 
Foreign investors will undoubtedly choose the countries 
offering the best conditions, especially those without price 
control. Now having more than 30 percent of the market is a 
mortal sin in Brazil, a sin that condemns an enterprise to 
several suspicions that can result not only in heavy monetary 
fines but also in the stealing of its technology... 
  We do not know whether our lawmakers thought about this when 
they approved a law that condemned us to remain behind 
technological progress in the modern world. It is good to know 
that this has favored our Mercosur partners, which will be able 
to create jobs, enlarge their domestic markets, and conquer the 
Brazilian market without any difficulty, unless we resign our 
participation in an organization that is only one step forward 
toward the globalization of the economy.

<F P=106> [Article by Paulo Francis] </F>
  [Text] PT [Workers Party] candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da 
Silva has said that, if elected, he will negotiate the foreign 
debt with U.S. President Bill Clinton because he might be more 
understanding than bankers. Only inexperienced people, unaware 
of how the world and U.S. society operate, would propose such a 
shortcut. By the way, this is a typical feature of PT programs 
like the one that will distribute land to landless people 
without even realizing that farming calls for capital, 
expertise, machinery, and a market -- modern features that 
educated people have known since the time of Adam Smith 
(1723-1790), the father of economists. 
  The Brazilian foreign debt is not owed to the U.S. President 
but to private banks, most of which are European or Asian. U.S. 
banks coordinate creditors, but they cannot impose anything on 
them. To summarize, the Brazilian foreign debt is a private 
matter. Since the time of Joao Figueiredo's government, no 
Brazilian Administration has understood how to manage the debt, 
and Washington has already tried to facilitate agreements. The 
most noticeable effort, which the Brazilian Government accepted 
after repeatedly promising that it would never do so, is the 
Brady plan, designed by George Bush's Treasury Secretary 
Nicholas Brady. Under this plan, indebted countries can buy 
their own debt certificates with discounts of up to 35 percent, 
substantially reducing the principal and postponing capital 
repayment through payment of interest. After faltering under 
the economic leadership of several amateurs, Brazil became a 
Brady plan client. If the teams of [former Presidents] Sarney 
and Collor were unfit -- just as Franco's team is -- one does 
not have to be clairvoyant to imagine the type of person Lula 
would select to contact bankers, considering the PT's exotic 
ideas on the subject. Brazil's largest creditor is the Bank of 
Brazil branch in New York, which can take the burden and remain 
silent. 
  Lula seems not to have even the slightest idea of our real 
debt situation. Negotiations call for endorsement by the IMF. 
Without that any arrangements are merely provisional and 
"initial accords" that are advertised as solutions but which -- 
months later -- appear to fail like everything that has been 
negotiated since the political opening in 1985. The IMF will 
back Brazil but only through a drastic reduction in our public 
deficit and with an accelerated policy of privatization that may 
reduce inflation to a single-digit figure (less than 10 percent 
monthly). Candidate Lula is against everything the IMF wants. 
If Lula is elected, the impasse will continue and -- what is 
even more serious -- Brazil will remain outside the 
international capital market, which is flourishing from Mexico 
to China.

  [Text] Santiago, 17 Jun (EFE) -- Chilean Foreign Minister 
Carlos Figueroa said today that the situation of the Chilean 
Consulate in Havana, which is occupied by eight Cubans, remains 
unchanged. Figueroa added that both foreign ministries continue 
to be in contact to try to find a definitive solution. 
  During a meeting with the local press, Figueroa said the 
basic discussion on the issue is "the upholding of international 
law," which has always characterized Chilean foreign policy. 
  Foreign Minister Figueroa said the Cuban citizens, who have 
been occupying the Chilean Consulate since 15 June, are not 
under asylum. He said this is a humanitarian gesture on the part 
of Chile and the situation will continue until a reasonable 
solution is found. 
  Figueroa added that because of the Cuban Government's 
refusal 
to grant safe conduct papers to allow the refugees to abandon 
the island, Chilean Consul Patricio Pozo has urged the refugees 
to leave the consulate peacefully. Figueroa stated that Pozo 
also has assured the refugees that the Cuban Government has 
promised not to take reprisals against them. 
  Asked whether the Chilean Government has established a 
certain deadline for solving the issue, Figueroa said no 
deadlines have been established, only objectives. 
  He said that one of these objectives is to achieve a 
peaceful 
solution and the other is to offer guarantees for the eight 
Cubans occupying the building. 
  Foreign Minister Figueroa stated: "We want to avoid making 
any explicit statement encouraging the occupation of other 
consulates or embassies." 
  Asked whether the Chilean Government will require Cuba to 
"adopt steps toward democracy" as a prior step before resuming 
diplomatic ties at the ambassadorial level, Figueroa said: "At 
no time has the Chilean Government made such a proposal to Cuba." 
  Chile and Cuba severed their diplomatic ties on 11 September 
1973. They restored diplomatic ties at the consular level in 
July 1991 after then-Chilean President Patricio Aylwin met Fidel 
Castro within the framework of the first Ibero-American Summit, 
held in Guadalajara, Mexico.

  [Excerpt] [Carabineros Director] General Rodolfo Stange has 
stated that his honor has been cleared. Government sources only 
said that Judge Alfredo Pfeiffer's ruling has removed an 
obstacle in the impasse between the Carabineros director and the 
executive branch. Politicians and relatives of the three 
beheaded professionals have reacted against the judge's ruling. 
  Gen. Stange arrived at 0830 this morning at the Carabineros 
building. He said he was happy with Judge Pfeiffer's ruling, 
which definitely acquits him of charges of serious disregard of 
military duties. 
  [Begin recording] [unidentified reporter] General, many 
people insist that this is more an ethical than a legal problem. 
What do you think? 
  [Stange] I believe testifying before a court is ethical, and 
that is what I did. I cannot comment on the court ruling. I only 
want the administration of justice in a situation in which I had 
been involved in a case and pre-judged. I only want my name and 
honor to be cleared. 
  [Reporter] Will you assume your duties in a normal manner? 
  [Stange] The normal duties I have always had because I have 
never left my command. [end recording] 
  Concerning Judge Pfeiffer's ruling, there has been no 
reaction from La Moneda Palace. The Defense Ministry released a 
brief communique which states that following the acquittal of 
the Carabineros director, an important obstacle has been removed 
in finding a solution to the impasse created between Gen. Stange 
and the government. No other statements have been made, although 
it was learned that, notwithstanding the ruling, the government 
maintains its position that Gen. Stange should leave the 
Carabineros. [passage omitted]

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Chile monitored through 16 
June. 
  The Italian multinational company Parmalat S.P.A. bought 51 
percent of the shares of the Chilean company Soprocar Inc., 
which makes and sells Copalca dairy products. On 25 May, 
Parmalat President Calisto Tanzi and Soprocar President Hernan 
Bozzo signed the agreement through which the Italian company 
officially entered the Chilean dairy products market under the 
name of Parmalat Chile. Soprocar general manager Gonzalo Martino 
reported that the initial investment totals $20 million. 
(Santiago LA TERCERA DE LA HORA in Spanish 26 May 94 Economic 
Section p 4) 
  The National Statistics Institute, INE, reported that the 
unemployment rate was 5.3 percent in the February-April period, 
an increase of 0.1 percentage point compared with the previous 
quarter, and 0.9 percentage point compared with the same period 
last year. This is the highest rate since September 1992. The 
number of employed people was 4,962,230, an increase of 2.6 
percent compared with 1993. This means that 126,490 jobs were 
created. The INE also reported that the unemployment rate 
dropped in five of the 13 regions during this period. (Santiago 
LA TERCERA DE LA HORA in Spanish 2 Jun 94 p 3) 
  Mexican and Chilean aeronautics authorities signed an 
agreement through which Chilean airlines will transport 
passengers from Mexico to San Jose de Costa Rica and Guatemala 
on their routes from Mexico to Chile. Air traffic between Chile 
and Mexico has increased considerably in the past few months. A 
total of 11,714 passengers and 551 metric tons of cargo were 
transported in the first four months of the year, an increase of 
5 percent and 65 percent, respectively, compared with the same 
period last year. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 1618 GMT 10 Jun 94) 
  The Chilean companies Copec, Sipetrol, and Enap, which made 
up the Latin American Oil Company, Clapsa, and the U.S. company 
Oryx Energy won the bid to prospect for oil in Ecuador for four 
years. They signed a risk contract in which they will invest $45 
million. The Chilean companies share the contract with 32.5 
percent and the U.S. company with 50 percent. The area to be 
prospected totals 2,000 square kilometers. (Madrid EFE in 
Spanish 1608 GMT 10 Jun 94)

  [Text] [Announcer] Attention: The polling stations just 
closed throughout the country. In a moment, the Caracol 
Network, which is number one in the elections, will begin to 
report figures so you can make your own additions with paper and 
pencil in hand. 
  Caracol listeners, it is now 1600. An honest, democratic 
event just ended in Colombia; an process that began at 0800 to 
elect the president of the Republic in runoff elections, to 
choose between Andres Pastrana and Ernesto Samper Pizano. The 
voting process just ended and the vote counting starts now. The 
Caracol network will now begin an information marathon to report 
figures from all cities and regions to allow you to make your 
own additions and learn in a matter of minutes who is the new 
president of the Republic. The authorities reported absolute 
normalcy. Here are the first results from Colferias fair 
grounds: 
  [Reporter] We have the results from table No. 434. Seven 
votes were cast; two blank, three for Andres Pastrana, and two 
for Ernesto Samper. 
  [Announcer] That was the result from the table at Colferias, 
table 434. Two blank votes, three for Pastrana, two for Samper. 
Caracol is reporting first. It is now 1601. Bring out your 
paper and pencil to keep your own tally. The government banned 
us from reporting totals, but you who know how to add can do so.

  [Text] The abstention rate dropped by 55 percent and voter 
turnout increased by more than 1 million compared to the first 
round of elections on 29 May. 
  [Begin unidentified reporter recording] Abstention was 
defeated very early in Santa Fe de Bogota, especially at the 
largest polling station, Corferias [exhibition center], where 
thousands of people lined up at the 226 voting tables there. A 
high percentage of young people decided to break their silence 
and vote in this round. However, many voters were turned away 
because they were not registered on the electoral lists. The 
voting took place in an atmosphere of relative normalcy without 
the presence of entertainers [animadores] -- as was permitted in 
the elections four years ago -- in keeping with the new 
electoral laws banning partying. 
  In the presence of authorities, electoral information tables 
were set up outside Corferias with propaganda of the Liberal 
candidate, while the public force closely watched the voting 
inside the Santa Fe de Bogota exhibition center. 
  There were no incidents, and the abstention that marked the 
29 May elections suffered a relative defeat today. [end

<F P=106> [Speech by Ernesto Samper Pizano, presidential candidate of </F>
Colombia's Liberal Party, from the Gonzalo Jimenez de Quesada 
Convention Center in Santa Fe de Bogota--live] 
  [Text] Mr. Humberto de la Calle Lombana, the vice president 
of Colombia. [cheers]. Dear friends: We have won. [cheers] 
This victory does not belong to Ernesto Samper; this victory 
belongs to all of you. [cheers] For the first time, after 
having adopted a new Constitution, we held an electoral process 
in accordance with the rules established by the National 
Constituent Assembly to modernize and cleanse the nation's 
politics and its administration. 
  One thing in particular pleases me, and I would like to 
spotlight it here, before all these foreign reporters. 
Colombians have also defeated abstention today. [cheers] We 
have shown the world Colombia has a great, modern, and open 
democracy, under which there is full assurance that all 
expressions of our pluralist society can compete. 
  All of Colombia's friends know that our country does fulfill 
its international commitments and will continue to do so and 
that they will find in Colombia an eager ally to fight for Latin 
American and Caribbean integration, for international 
cooperation, for the peaceful resolution of all conflicts, and 
that we will combat drug trafficking and ensure that 
international law prevails. 
  I am reaching the Colombian Presidency following a long 
career that began many years ago and that has had many stages. 
In all of them, in all of them there has been an invariable 
guideline. I have been and I will always be a tireless worker, 
and I believe there is no effort that can be spared when it 
comes to helping the people. I have always acted, and I will 
always act inspired by my great love for Colombia and by the 
conviction that our country must be immense so it can house all 
Colombians and their kids. [cheers] 
  I am now thinking about Luis Carlos Galan and many other 
murdered people. His death was the biggest tragedy Colombians 
experienced, but it would have been even worse if that sacrifice 
were in vain. The ideals of Galan in favor of an honest exercise 
of politics and government will be the objectives for which my 
administration will work every day, every hour, and every 
minute. [cheers] 
  I also salute President Gaviria. His vision and courage 
gave Colombia a great push in favor of the country's 
modernization, which we are going to continue. His government 
proved we were not anchored in the past. My campaign programs 
to create jobs and elect a government that can work in favor of 
the people are no longer the proposals of a candidate; they are 
the plans of a president who will fulfill them with everyone's 
support. 
  I am very grateful to all Colombians for the support they 
gave me today. I am especially grateful to my party, the 
Liberal Party [cheers] and the members of the Alliance for 
Colombia. I am grateful to those who voted for me. I also send 
my fraternal greetings to those who voted for Andres Pastrana. 
I invite them to work to make our dreams become a reality, our 
dreams of peace, social justice, and progress. We are now 
facing an open window, a window of opportunities, a window of 
which we are going to take advantage with everyone's support and 
for everyone's benefit. 
  Dr. Andres Pastrana should be praised for making a great 
effort to conduct a different campaign. I found a persistent 
competitor in him. I also extend to him my friendly hand and 
congratulate him for conducting an innovative campaign. I want 
to thank many people for their support and their contribution in 
this victory. I want to emphasize the support of Jaquin, my 
wife. [cheers] She experienced the intensity of this long 
campaign. As anyone else, she always worked with enthusiasm, 
which was needed during times of fatigue, and she exhibited an 
optimism that never lagged when times were difficult. As anyone 
else, she always had a smile. [cheers] 
  I want to thank my mother, Jaquin, Andres, Miguel, and 
Felipe; they were decisive factors during this stage. They are 
also going to be the most important individuals of my life. 
  I want to thank my collaborators and my running mate, 
Humberto de la Calle. He is an exemplary Colombian. I also 
want to thank Rosalba. Our work was worthwhile so that we could 
come out ahead, not only because we won an election, but because 
we have given Colombians a road full of hope. Our duty is to 
think about the future generations. Our mission is to work for 
the future. We are going to work without respite for the needy 
of Colombia. We received a social mandate from the Colombian 
countryside today. I want to speak with sincerity to 
Colombians. I am anxious to start working for Colombia as early 
as tomorrow. 
  I am counting on your support, your work, and even your 
sacrifice, when necessary, to make our dream come true. 
Everyone's commitment and participation are the greatest 
strength our democracy has as well as our country's secret 
weapon and the shortest way to prosperity. 
  My dear friends, let us work to take advantage of the 
opportunities and face the challenges that await us during the 
next four years. We will face them without hatred or fear and 
with the responsibility the majority of our fellow Colombians 
have given us. I call on all citizens of goodwill, who are the 
majority, to join us in this time of change we are now 
beginning. I hereby declare myself free of all bitterness or 
animosity. [cheers] 
  No Colombian will be subject to discrimination during my 
administration due to his or her political party, beliefs, or 
racial origin. I invite all of those who mistakenly chose the 
road of armed conflict to reconsider and lay down their weapons. 
Let me say there is still space for peace. To my adversaries I 
say: I guarantee you a part, if you so wish, in the process of 
social transformation we will set in motion. I call on all of 
you to join in this new period of work. The time for Colombia's 
great social leap has come. [cheers]

<F P=106> [Interview with Ernesto Samper, presidential candidate of </F>
Colombia's Liberal Party, by unidentified reporter and Caracol 
News Director Dario Arizmendi from the Gonzalo Jimenez de 
Quesada Convention Center in Santa Fe de Bogota--live] 
  [Text] [Reporter] Greetings from Caracol Network and 
congratulations for your victory today. 
  [Samper] Thank you. I am very pleased with this victory and 
for the opportunity to offer to Colombians, as I said today, a 
government of cohesion and social commitment. 
  [Reporter] You said there were similarities with Andres 
Pastrana's campaign concerning peace, social justice, and 
progress. Does that mean you could call some of Pastrana's 
followers to work with you in those three fields? 
  [Samper] I believe all Colombians coincide in those fields. 
All possibilities of cooperation are welcome as long as we can 
agree. 
  [Reporter] I know you asked me to be brief, but Dario 
Arizmendi wants to greet you from our studios. 
  [Arizmendi] Congratulations, and greetings to Ernesto Samper 
Pizano; we sincerely say this, because we know how he carried 
out his campaign, the difficulties he had to overcome. We wish 
him success, because his success will also be Colombia's. 
  [Samper] Thank you, Dario, for your message. I also 
reiterate my gratitude to Caracol and other networks for the 
wide coverage they gave my campaign. That was the best 
contribution they could give to democracy. 
  [Arizmendi] Thank you, President-elect Ernesto Samper 
Pizano. 
This was the president-elect's first interview in Colombia. 
  [Reporter] I would like to ask the president-elect when he 
plans to accompany the soccer team representing Colombia at the 
World Cup to the United States. 
  [Samper] We will see. I will begin the transition process 
tomorrow, and I hope to have the opportunity this same week. I 
tried to call Maturana and El Pibe today to dedicate to them 
this victory, which somewhat compensates the setback we had last 
night. I want to tell them I hope this victory will encourage 
them, so that on 22 June they can give all Colombians the good 
news on the World Cup. 
  [Arizmendi] Will you be there on 22 or 26 June? 
  [Samper] I do not have travel plans yet. I believe I may 
decide tomorrow. 
  [Arizmendi] When will you announce your cabinet, on 7 August 
or before? 
  [Samper] We will see. For now, I will sit down to prepare a 
transition plan to guarantee continuity. I already had the 
opportunity to talk with President Gaviria twice this afternoon. 
I hope we can meet again this week to continue working in that 
direction. 
  [Arizmendi] Did you talk with Andres Pastrana by telephone? 
  [Samper] No. I have not had the opportunity to greet him. 
  [Arizmendi] Did you hear his speech conceding defeat and 
recognizing your victory? 
  [Samper] Yes, Dario, I did hear it. 
  [Arizmendi] What are your comments about Pastrana's speech? 
  [Samper] I believe Pastrana has created a very important 
political opening, because 3.5 million votes are a very 
interesting figure that reflects the support he received. I am 
sure he will use that opening to benefit the activities he 
proposed during his campaign; to that effect, he can also count 
on my support. 
  [Arizmendi] What does that support mean? A representation in 
your cabinet, if he agrees, as you mentioned in your speech? 
  [Samper] Yes. The decision on cooperation will depend on the 
position Pastrana adopts. 
  [Arizmendi] Pastrana said he also offered his cooperation to 
Colombia, in other words, to your government and that he 
recognized your victory. Will you then directly invite 
Pastrana's friends and representatives? 
  [Samper] We will sit down and decide this later on. Right 
now we are celebrating our victory, but tomorrow we will begin 
our political contacts. 
  [Arizmendi] What was your most difficult moment today? Were 
you confident of your victory, or did you have any doubts? 
  [Samper] I remained calm at all times. I learned this week I 
had good opportunities to win, something that did, in fact, 
occur. 
  [Arizmendi] Did you learn about the results of the exit poll 
conducted by the Caracol Network and the National Consultative 
Center? 
  [Samper] Yes I did, and I understand the figures are very 
similar to the ones released by the National Registrar. 
  [Arizmendi] What will be the first thing the president-elect 
will do tomorrow after this historic night? 
  [Samper] I will sit down to talk with my working teams 
tomorrow. I have some commitments with the international media. 
I will give them as many interviews as possible, because I 
believe we must take advantage of this opportunity to let others 
know more about our country and the plans of the next government. 
  [Arizmendi] To whom do you dedicate your victory? 
  [Samper] To Colombian democracy and all Colombians, for whom 
I have struggled all my life. 
  [Arizmendi] You won by a wide margin in Santa Fe de Bogota 
and practically in all the departments along the Atlantic Coast. 
Will they benefit the most from your victory? 
  [Samper] No. I am not going to discriminate. I will govern 
for all regions and for all Colombians.

<F P=106> [Speech by Colombian President Cesar Gaviria at the Narino </F>
Palace in Santa Fe de Bogota -- live] 
  [Text] Colombians: Today we experienced one of the most 
important moments in the history of our nation when we chose the 
person who will rule the country until August 1998. We did this 
with an unprecedented democratic spirit and with a turnout that 
far exceeded that recorded during the first round on 29 May. 
Voter turnout surpassed 7.3 million; that is, we registered the 
highest turnout in the country's history. 
  As president of the Republic, I am moved by the fact that we 
fulfilled our democratic duty peacefully, and I therefore want 
to congratulate each and every one of the millions of Colombians 
who voted today to work toward a better future for this country 
that we love so much. 
  First I want to congratulate the victor, who by the 
Colombians' decision will be president of the Republic on 7 
August. I want to congratulate and express my admiration for 
Ernesto Samper Pizano and Jaquin [Samper's wife] and to voice my 
most ardent and sincere wishes that his government will be 
successful in the search for peace, well-being, and social 
justice for Colombians. 
  As a partner in the Liberal struggles for many years and as 
an important member of this administration, Ernesto Samper was a 
victim of the blind violence that has brought so much suffering 
to this nation. Nevertheless, his experience strengthened his 
determination, and he will dedicate the second chance life 
granted him to advancing his ideals for a better country; a 
tolerant, pluralist country that respects human rights. He will 
create new jobs. I know these things will happen because he 
undoubtedly has all the qualities needed to achieve these goals. 
  Humberto de la Calle will be a loyal partner at the vice 
presidency, and from there he will always contribute his 
intelligence, good judgment, and valuable experiences to 
strengthening our democracy. 
  I also want to congratulate Andres Pastrana Arango. I owe 
him my thanks for his generous support for my government in 
difficult times. The campaign he has conducted and his human 
and professional capabilities have won him immense support from 
the citizens. Both he and his running mate, former Labor 
Minister Luis Fernando Ramirez, were worthy candidates for this 
electoral debate. I applaud the patriotic gesture by Andres 
Pastrana a few moments ago when he recognized the results of 
this election. 
  The National Civil Registry has once again earned the 
applause of all Colombians. As president of the Republic, I 
wish to congratulate the registrar and each official of that 
institution. 
  The high turnout in today's elections shows the democratic 
maturity of the Colombian people. There is no doubt that we 
have restored our faith in our potential, in our ability to face 
adversity, and in the fine qualities of our people. It is also 
a demonstration of the benefits of the ballot, of the second 
round as established by the Constitution, and of the spirit of 
democratic participation as established by the 1991 
Constitution. It is a demonstration of the desire for peace of 
a vast majority of the Colombian people. Without a doubt, we 
have made progress in the construction of a better future for 
our children and for new generations of Colombians. 
  Colombians; there are times in a nation's life when the 
courage of its people is tested. Today we have shown once again 
that nothing can stop this country on its road to a better 
future. Nothing in the world is capable of stopping the firm 
convictions of a united people who have confidence in their 
ability to take the reins of their future in their own hands. 
  Thank you very much and good night.

<F P=106> [Speech by Andres Pastrana, presidential candidate of </F>
Colombia's Conservative Party, from the Red Room of the 
Tequendama Hotel in Santa Fe de Bogota--live] 
  [Text] Before anything else, I want to say thank you, 
Colombia. Before anything else, I want to congratulate Ernesto 
Samper Pizano. [cheers] Before anything else, I want to 
congratulate Ernesto Samper for his election as president of the 
Republic. [cheers] We bid him the best of luck; we bid him the 
best of luck because we want the best of luck for Colombia. 
  We were contenders in this campaign, but the campaign ended. 
We are no longer divided between Samperists and Andreists 
today. We are all Colombians, [cheers] and nothing is more 
important than fighting for the future of our fatherland and 
liberating it from the politics and poverty of the past. We 
thank the 3.5 million Colombians who supported us, those who 
shared our hopes, and those who demonstrated they want the 
change we proposed. I truly tell them this is not Andres' time, 
but we are going to do everything within our reach so that this 
can be Colombia's time. [cheers] 
  I did this campaign independent of the economic groups. I 
did this campaign against the political machineries, against 
corruption, and against the drug traffickers. 
  That is why [crowd shouts: "No"] that is why [repeats 
himself] I assured the country a president who has received 
money from drug trafficking has no moral right to lead Colombia. 
We recovered our campaign's moral tone and the sense of decency 
in politics, and that is what the Colombian people voted for 
today. That was the motivation behind the struggle of this 
campaign, and it is the foundation of the new political phase 
that I am inviting you to initiate with us as of today. 
[applause, cheers] The people's vote is the strongest of 
voices in a free society. 
  We have heard that voice today, and we will obey it. We will 
continue to strive for educational reform so that we can prepare 
our people for the work that lies ahead in the 21st century. We 
will continue to support training and programs of improvement 
for our workers and work-oriented educational plans so as to 
make new opportunities for the young people who cannot go to a 
university. We will continue to defend drinking water as a basic 
right and not a privilege. 
  We hope and expect the 660,000 housing units will become a 
reality for our fellow Colombians who have no home. We will be 
determined in our search for peace and security for all our 
fellow Colombians, particularly the weakest. We will continue 
to oppose with all our strength the legalization of drugs. 
[cheers] All of these things were by no means mere 
presidential campaign promises; they were and remain commitments 
we hold deep in our minds and in the bottom of our heart. 
  Allow me to tell the 3.5 million Colombians--the 3.5 million 
of you who supported us--and all Colombians alike that as of 
right now we begin fighting for these commitments and more. 
[cheers] We have begun to fight for these and other 
commitments to make Colombia the country of our dreams. 
  In conclusion, I want to thank you. [cheers, chants] I 
finally want to thank all of those who worked hard with us in 
this campaign. I want to thank all of those who supported us in 
this voyage for change without giving up the faith in their 
hearts. We want to thank the women, the workers, the peasants, 
the young people, and all those who campaigned along with their 
parents as they never did before. I also want to thank the 
children who campaigned along with their parents as we had never 
seen before. 
  Allow me to express my deep feelings of gratitude to Luis 
Fernando Ramirez. [cheers] He is going to be a powerful force 
in Colombia's future. We have already seen his capabilities and 
work in the social security reforms. They will reach each and 
every Colombian thanks to him . 
  I especially want to thank the companion of my life, the 
mother of my children, [cheers, chants] my friend, and my 
trustworthy partner. She was with me all the way, touring the 
country inch by inch. Thank you. 
  I also want to thank my parents and my brothers for their 
support and confidence. [cheers] They are the source of my 
inspiration. I also want to thank all the individuals whom I 
discovered throughout this marvelous country. 
  I want to thank those people who are willing to give 
everything they can to carry out the hard work we all want in 
order to make changes. 
  I will never forget the hands I shook during each one of my 
tours. I will never forget the places we visited nor each one 
of the conversations I had with you, face to face; with you, the 
Colombian people; [shouts] with you, the people of Colombia and 
each and every one of you who welcomed us, who welcomed Nora, 
Luis Hernando, and Emilia; all of us, in each one of your 
cities, of your neighborhoods, plazas, blocks, and streets; and 
above all, those who received us in your hearts. I thank you 
all. 
  This has been a campaign of the people. It was among you 
that I found the strength and the reason to run for president 
[applause], and it is from you that I will keep finding the 
strength to continue seeking the well-being of all Colombians. 
Your needs, your hopes are my reasons. 
  I did not seek the Colombian Presidency for its importance 
or 
to simply obtain a title. I did it because I believe it is the 
president's duty to struggle for the people's work. The 
president has the opportunity to make Colombia a country of 
opportunities. [shouts] That challenge goes beyond any time or 
any campaign. A new generation of leaders makes us keep on 
moving ahead. 
  Therefore, I ask you tonight to keep loving our country, to 
keep helping our country advance, and together with each one of 
our actions, let us continue to serve the people and not the 
powerful. [shouts] That has been and will remain our objective. 
That was and remains our vision. Not today, but some day not 
too far away, we will have the opportunity to make it a reality. 
Thank you. [applause]

  [Text] Medellin has suffered several bomb attacks in the 
past few hours. According to authorities, the bombs were of 
medium power. 
  Eleven 7-kg bombs were detonated against banking and 
financial institutions, while two others were defused by the 
police. The attacks started at 2300 local and the explosions 
occurred simultaneously in central Medellin and the 
northeastern, northwestern, and southern areas of the city. 
  [Begin recording] [General Luis Ernesto Gilibert, head of 
the 
Metropolitan Police] Since last night, we have been preparing 
for new terrorist attacks. 
  [Reporter] Who are the perpetrators of these attacks? 
  [Gen Gilibert] Subversives, who attempt to hamper the 
electoral process. [end recording] 
  The explosions, which caused damage amounting to more than 
100 million pesos, injured a young girl. Police have posted a 
reward of 10 million pesos for information on the identities of 
those responsible for the terrorist actions. The police believe 
members of an ELN [National Liberation Army] city cell are 
responsible for these incidents. The ELN is also blamed for an 
attack on a police patrol on Tuesday. Personnel of security 
agencies are on a first- level alert to guarantee public order 
in the Antioquia Department capital city. 
  [Paris AFP at 1447 GMT on 17 June transmits a 229-word 
report 
stating that 17 bombs were set off Thursday night in Medellin, 
each with an estimated 5-kg weight]

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Jairo Calle and unidentified </F>
announcer] 
  [Text] [Announcer] We have a last minute report from 
Medellin. Here is Jairo Calle: 
  [Calle] Yes, good evening. Unfortunately, there has been an 
escalation of terrorism in the city. Approximately eight bombs 
have been detonated in different areas of the city. So far, 
there is no report from the authorities about the situation. 
The only thing we know is that there have been detonations in 
the city's east side and the nearby Bello Municipality. There 
have also been explosions near the Caracol facilities in Los 
Laureles and in the area of 80th Boulevard in western Medellin. 
So far there are no reports on whether the detonations, which 
have alarmed citizens, have caused casualties or damage. This 
is our report from Medellin. We understand that many of these 
terrorist actions were directed at banks. The authorities have 
begun to report that some CONAVI's [National Savings and Housing 
Corporation], such as the one located in Manrique in the city's 
east side, have been the target of these explosions. The 
Suramericana Bank branch in Los Laureles, near Caracol, was also 
affected by one of the explosions. 
  [Announcer] Jairo, might this be an escalation of acts of 
terrorism like the ones the Simon Bolivar Guerrilla Coordinating 
Board frequently undertakes in various parts of the country? 
You say that eight bombs have exploded so far? 
  [Calle] Yes, this is an escalation that had been foreseen. 
The authorities had intensified the so-called Democracy Plan 
this evening because there was intelligence information about 
these terrorist attacks and sabotage of the city's urban bus 
service, as occurred before the previous elections, when 16 
vehicles were set on fire. 
  [Announcer] Well, eight bombs have exploded in the past few 
minutes in Medellin. Authorities indicate that it seems this is 
an escalation of terrorism against banking institutions. So 
far, no casualties are reported, although there are damages.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 18 Jun (AFP) -- It was 
officially reported here today that guerrilla threats could keep 
about 12,000 citizens of Bolivar Department in northern Colombia 
from voting in the 19 June presidential runoff elections. 
  Department Registrar Maria Rocio Cortes told the media that 
"we still do not know how we are going to solve the problem" 
created by the resignation of electoral delegates and voting 
officers in 20 corregimientos of Simiti and Santa Rosa 
Municipalities. She admitted that, despite the fact that units 
from two Army brigades are in control of the area, the people 
are just as afraid as they were during the 29 May elections, 
when the abstention rate in the area reached 85 percent. 
  It has just been learned that with the support of regular 
troops, efforts are being made to transport civil registry 
personnel from other communities by helicopter so the elections 
can be held. 
  In Medellin, the country's second largest city in the 
northwest, a drop in the number of buses providing service was 
noticed today due to threats by the People's Militias, which 
yesterday burned a bus in an effort to hinder the elections.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 19 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Within the 
framework of the presidential elections, Colombian guerrillas 
have kidnapped 10 persons, including electoral delegates and 
voting officers, in northeastern part of the country, 
authorities reported today. Alvaro Dagon, government secretary 
in the Santander Department, disclosed that the officials were 
kidnapped by rebel units when they were getting ready to set up 
the voting table in the Garcia Rovira Province. 
  Colombians today will elect President Cesar Gaviria's 
successor, either Ernesto Samper of the Liberal Party or Andres 
Pastrana of the New Democratic Force. Samper and Pastrana were 
the candidates who obtained the highest number of votes in the 
29 May elections; however, neither obtained the 50 percent of 
the vote required for victory in the first round. 
  The source reported that among those kidnapped is the police 
inspector of "El Cerrito" Municipality, which is near the site 
of the kidnapping, approximately 460 km from Santa Fe de Bogota. 
Despite the kidnappings, the local authorities guaranteed that 
the elections will take place in a normal fashion, saying that 
the officials had been replaced this morning. 
  In addition, 15 other electoral delegates resigned from 
their 
posts at "Santa Rosa de Simiti" Municipality in the northern 
part of the country in light of the death threats received from 
the Simon Bolivar guerrilla group, the report stated. 
  Meanwhile, at "Legrija" Municipality in the northern 
Santander Department the rebels engaged in a confrontation with 
government troops. One guerrilla died, the source reported. 
  Another adverse action was registered in Medellin, the 
second 
most important city in the nation, where rebel units set off 
several home-made bombs causing no victims, although 
considerable damage was reported.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Colombian Defense Minister Rafael </F>
Pardo Rueda in Santa Fe de Bogota by station director Dario 
Arizmendi and unidentified station announcer in Emisoras 
Caracol's Santa Fe de Bogota studios; from "Caracol's 0600 to 
0900" newscast -- live] 
  [Text] [Announcer] Good morning, Mr. Minister. Our 
respects from Caracol. We would like you to speak with our 
director, Dario Arizmendi, who is in the station's master 
control room, regarding the status of public order in the 
country today, as Colombia is electing a new president. 
  [Pardo] The reports on the public security situation that 
are 
available to us thus far do not reveal any incidents that could 
delay the elections. The Defense Ministry is going to provide 
related information and official public order reports on a 
regular basis. However, at this time, we do not have any 
reports from any place saying that, because of public order 
problems, elections will be delayed. 
  [Arizmendi] Mr. Minister, our respects from Caracol's 
central 
master control room. Do you believe soldiers should be able to 
vote in the elections? In Colombia, legal regulations and the 
Constitution stipulate that soldiers cannot vote. 
  [Pardo] No, I do not believe soldiers should vote. I believe 
that, in light of the current situation Colombia faces, the 
circumstances, and the role played by the military forces in 
Colombia, it is not appropriate for soldiers to vote. I believe 
so because the Colombian Armed Forces play the fundamental role 
of guaranteeing the elections. For instance, the public forces 
are guarding over 90 percent of the 47,000 voting tables. The 
parties themselves have asked for the public forces to be 
present at the voting tables and sites, lending their support 
for the electoral organization. This entails an absolute and 
total neutrality and a lack of party allegiance on the part of 
public forces members. This is why I deem it appropriate to 
maintain this legal prohibition that dates back to 1930 and has 
been part of Colombian traditions. 
  [Arizmendi] Judging from your experience, do you believe our 
next president, whom we will be electing today, should appoint a 
civilian to the Defense Ministry? 
  [Pardo] This is normal in a democracy. I believe that all 
Colombians must begin to get used to this situation and that it 
should be usual within the Defense Ministry. 
  [Arizmendi] At this juncture, do you believe all generals 
nationwide are happy and satisfied and consider having a 
civilian as defense minister a pleasant experience? 
  [Pardo] As for myself, the task I have fulfilled has been, 
rather than pleasant, very constructive and significant. On 
behalf of democracy, it is crucial that the defense minister 
have the capacity to answer politically and assume political 
responsibilities. I deem this appropriate for any democracy, 
and for the Colombian democracy, in particular, I believe it 
should be the rule in the future. 
  [Arizmendi] Would you like to remain in your post as defense 
minister if you are confirmed by the president-elect? 
  [Pardo] I have a term, which will end on 7 August. 
  [Arizmendi] Are you planning to go overseas or stay in 
Colombia? 
  [Pardo] I am trying to get a scholarship to study abroad. 
  [Arizmendi] Where would you like to study? 
  [Pardo] I do not know yet, any place abroad. I have a few 
possibilities in mind, have sent several applications, and hope 
something will come through. 
  [Arizmendi] What would you like to study? 
  [Pardo] Basically, I am interested in reflecting on all I 
have done in the public arena all these years. I would like to 
further my knowledge regarding that area. There are many new 
trends, international situations, and I have great interest in 
learning more about issues of this sort. 
  [Arizmendi] In order to participate actively in Colombian 
politics later on? 
  [Pardo] [Words indistinct] to study. 
  [Arizmendi] It is time to make assessments. [Words 
indistinct] What is your assessment on the war against the 
guerrillas? 
  [Pardo] I believe there is a basic factor in this situation. 
Three or four years ago, the guerrillas constituted a necessary 
player [referencia obligatoria] in Colombian politics. Any 
issue being debated required to some extent -- in order to be 
thoroughly examined -- the opinion of the guerrillas. The 
guerrillas gave their views and issued communiques on every 
subject. They constituted a permanent player in the entire 
political process and the national situation. This situation 
has changed dramatically. Today's guerrillas might continue 
causing harm and might be able to perpetrate crimes, but they do 
not constitute a key player in Colombian politics anymore. 
Today's guerrillas are a criminal element that remains on the 
sidelines. We are all concerned about the guerrillas and would 
like to see the problem resolved promptly, preferably in a 
negotiated manner, but the truth is that they do not constitute 
a leading player in Colombian politics anymore. 
  [Arizmendi] However, how many soldiers have been deployed 
nationwide today to guarantee peace and keep the order? 
  [Pardo] There are between 130,000 and 140,000 soldiers 
directly involved in the electoral process.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colombian Defense Minister Rafael Pardo </F>
Rueda by unidentified reporter in Santa Fe de Bogota on 19 June; 
from the "NTC News" newscast -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Reporter] There is relative normality on this 
election day. What is the final report you have? 
  [Pardo] There have been some problems with regard to the 
destruction of voting material in District 1 in Cauca and 
another in northern Santander. There have been problems in 
approximately six to seven districts upon the arrival of Civil 
Registry delegates or those from the electoral organization. In 
the Sucre municipality, Sucre Department, a confrontation also 
took place between a group of rebels and electoral officials. 
All these sites are preparing to replace the material, while 
delegates have been appointed by the electoral organization to 
replace those who did not show up.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Government Minister Fabio Villegas </F>
by reporter Carlos Ruiz and an unidentified reporter at Plaza 
Bolivar in Santa Fe de Bogota and by station director Dario 
Arizmendi in Emisoras Caracol's Santa Fe de Bogota studios; from 
"Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Ruiz] Mr. Minister: What is your message to the 
nation, through the Caracol network, with regard to today's 
election? 
  [Villegas] I invite all Colombians to vote today, we should 
go early to the voting tables to vote and elect en mass our 
future president. In our opinion, whoever occupies the 
Presidency can do so in a much more legitimate manner, with 
greater authority, depending on the extent to which a greater 
number of Colombians vote. The goal is to strengthen democracy, 
strengthen peace, and strengthen all the values and hopes of the 
Colombians. The goal is to defeat violence and those who still 
attempt, through terrorism, to impose their political will on 
this country. 
  [Reporter] What report do you have on the situation in the 
nation at the opening of the voting tables? 
  [Villegas] We understand that everything is perfectly 
normal. 
Nevertheless, yesterday there were some difficulties in southern 
Bolivar Department, in the province of [name indistinct] in the 
Santander Department. These were taken care of by the public 
forces, the electoral organization, and the local authorities. 
Early this morning, there were some terrorist actions in 
Medellin; however, we hope these will not hamper the normal 
development of the elections. The idea is for Medellin to 
reaffirm its desire to be a calm capital, as it deserves. One 
of the ways to do this is to participate in the elections. 
  [Ruiz] Have the two delegates of the contending parties been 
sent to all the nation's municipalities as they requested? 
  [Villegas] Presidential delegates were sent to each and 
every department in compliance with one of the mechanisms to 
give guarantees to the parties that are participating in these 
elections. Currently these delegates should be in the 
departments. We expect them to act as overseers of the electoral 
process and of the performance by the electoral officials, the 
electoral organization, and the public forces. They are to 
report to the appropriate authorities all their observations, 
all the irregularities that they possibly may observe in order 
to correct them. 
  [Ruiz] Mr. Minister, Dario Arizmendi and our colleagues at 
Caracol station will now greet you. [passage omitted] 
  [Arizmendi] A few moments ago we talked with Defense 
Minister 
Rafael Pardo. He told us that he wanted to study abroad, had 
sent applications to some universities, and wants to further 
study contemporary issues. He is most certainly thinking about 
his future. What will you do after 7 August? 
  [Villegas] That is the big question. I still do not have an 
answer. 
  [Arizmendi] Would you like a diplomatic post? 
  [Villegas] There is nothing planned yet. We want to conclude 
a series of actions we have pending at the Government Ministry. 
One of these is precisely these elections. After that, we will 
have the time to think over what is more appropriate. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Except for a few isolated incidents, calmness 
reigned throughout the country on 19 June, according to 
authorities. 
  [Begin recording] [Defense Minister Rafael Pardo] Out of the 
more than 47,200 voting tables, 160 experienced problems, in one 
way or another, related to public order or difficult or 
obstructed voting, and of this amount, electoral organization 
delegates failed to show up on time at approximately 100 tables 
due to transportation problems and intimidation. Electoral 
material was destroyed or stolen at 60 tables. Electoral 
organization officials were able to overcome most of these 
problems throughout the day. 
  [General Octavio Vargas, police director] The outcome is 
very 
satisfactory. There were a few incidents, such as in the 
Departments of Sucre, Arauca, and Santander, but the public 
force took care of them. [end recording]

  [Text] Barely 43 hours before the election that will decide 
who will be the new president of Colombia, voter preference is 
more divided now than in previous elections. Recent polls 
indicate a virtual tie between the two candidates. The election 
results on 19 June will surely be a photo finish. This is why 
Ernesto Samper Pizano and Andres Pastrana Arango will begin a 
bona fide Colombian tour in order to secure the votes that will 
take them into Narino Presidential Palace. 
  Andres Pastrana will visit Armenia, Pereira, Medellin, 
Moteria, Cartagena, Barranquilla, Santa Marta, Valledupar, 
Cucuta, and Bucaramanga this weekend. Meanwhile, Ernesto Samper 
Pizano will visit Popayan, Pasto, Neiva, and a half dozen other 
cities in the southwest. The two candidates are asking 
Colombians to defeat abstention on 19 June. Before beginning 
their tours, the two candidates expressed their confidence in 
winning: 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Why should 
Colombians vote for you? 
  [Pastrana] For change. The country realized on 29 May the 
country can change. People saw change was, in fact, possible; 
that is why we are telling the people that if one extra person 
votes for Andres along with the 2.5 million Colombians who did 
the last time, we will have consolidated change in Colombia. 
  [Reporter] Why should Colombians vote for you? 
  [Samper] Because I believe I have the necessary experience 
and knowledge to administrate the country. I have an excellent 
running mate, Humberto de la Calle. We represent the new 
Colombia. We represent those who do not want to be 
discriminated against and want better living conditions. I am 
ready to make the social turn Colombia needs. [end recording]

  [Text] Liberal candidate Ernesto Samper Pizano has been 
proclaimed the official winner of the first round of the 29 May 
presidential elections. 
  Samper defeated Andres Pastrana by 18,439 votes. The two 
will face each other again next Sunday to determine the final 
winner. 
  Samper obtained 45.3 percent of the votes to Pastrana's 
44.98 
percent. Antonio Navarro placed third with 3.79 percent of the 
vote. 
  The difference between Samper and Pastrana dropped by only 
3,000 votes in comparison to the figure cited in the last 
bulletin issued by the National Civil Registry on election day. 
  The official data is contained in the final report that the 
National Electoral Council presented publicly on 15 June. 
  This organization also presented the final documents of the 
13 March legislative elections. 
  According to the official results, Liberalism reaffirmed its 
majority in the legislative branch by winning 56 percent of the 
seats. 
  Conservatism, which was represented by various groups, 
obtained 25 percent of the seats. 
  In the Senate, Fuad Char received the largest number of 
votes 
with 84,322. The last to "qualify" for a seat was Hector Heli 
Rojas with 21,861 votes. 
  Voter turnout was higher in the first round of the 
presidential elections than in the legislative elections. 
  A total of 5,170,316 citizens voted on 13 March, and 
5,821,331 voted on 29 May. 
  The special Indian district elected Lorenzo Muelas of the

Indian Communities [Comunidades Indigenas] as their 
representatives in the Senate.

Movement] leaders Otti Patino, Gloria Quinceno, Eduardo Chavez, 
and German Rojas have told their followers they should not vote 
for Ernesto Samper, because what the country wants is a 
government of unity, not a party government. 
  [Begin Pastrana recording] I condemn any attempt to buy 
votes, no matter what. We want an open and clean election, and 
that is exactly for what we are going to fight. We are going to 
work to defeat the old policy, those who believe that by buying 
consciences and votes they can reach power. [end recording] 
  Regarding the Liberal Party, Juan Diego Jaramillo expressed 
his support today for presidential candidate Ernesto Samper. 
Meanwhile, Samper said he is not worried about the tie the 
recent polls are indicating. 
  [Begin Samper recording] Polls do not worry me. They 
indicate a tie, but if you compare these polls with other polls 
you will see there is an upward trend, and I believe that trend 
will benefit me during the 19 June election. [end recording]

  [Text] A total of 13,000 Indians, members of the 
Evangelical Indian Association of Chimborazo, an affiliate of 
the Ecuadoran Federation of Evangelical Indians, Feine, 
peacefully occupied the Cajamarca-Guamote Highway to reject the 
religious education and agrarian development bills. 
  Francisco Waspa, president of the Association, said the 
action is intended to express the Indians' rejection of the 
aforementioned bills. We want to remind the government that a 
peaceful people exists and will continue to exist in Ecuador, 
but we are entitled to having our fair aspirations considered. 
  Francisco Waspa said the association comprises 500 
communities. He added that in the framework of respect for 
authorities and for public and private property, his associate 
will ask the government and the National Congress to comply with 
the following points: 
  1. The National Government must comply with the Commitment 
Letter [Carta de Compromiso] signed on 11 October 1992, which 
contains a list of 23 demands regarding nutrition, health, 
education, and strengthening of popular organizations. 
  2. We reject the mobilization of the public force as a 
measure of avoiding possible bloodshed because the Evangelical 
Indian peoples condemn violence and vandalism in principle. 
  3. The National Congress must suspend the religious 
education 
bill. 
  The president of the Association of Evangelical Indians of 
Chimborazo says his organization is willing to suspend its 
action as soon as the government guarantees that its demands 
will be met.

  [Text] Quito, 18 Jun (DPA) -- While cities in eight 
Ecuadoran provinces remained under seige by Indian groups today, 
albeit with less violence than in previous days, the government 
announced that on Monday there will be "high-level negotiations 
with an open agenda." 
  The barricades erected on Monday by demonstrators linked to 
the powerful Confederation of Indian Nationalities of Ecuador 
(Conaie) continue to paralyze central Ecuador, blocking all 
roads and highways and causing an increasing shortage of food 
and fuel. 
  Prices have skyrocketed in practically all Ecuadoran cities 
over the last 48 hours following a government announcement that 
it would not open the roads by force. 
  Monday's negotiation will reportedly be headed by the 
Ecuadoran president himself, liberal politician Sixto 
Duran-Ballen, in accordance with demands made by the Conaie 
leadership, which said the strike will not be lifted until the 
agrarian law, in effect since 13 June, is repealed. 
  The law was approved 10 days earlier by the 
opposition-controlled Ecuadoran Congress. 
  Conaie opposes the law because it guarantees ownership of 
land that is "fulfilling a social mission," thereby limiting the 
agrarian reform process that has been applied for the past three 
decades, a period during which, according to official figures, 
Ecuadoran agricultural production has dropped dramatically. 
Other Indian organizations support the agrarian law. 
  The government, through Agriculture Minister Mariano 
Gonzalez, has already said that the "law is good and will be 
kept." Following the announcement of negotiations on Monday, 
however, the possibility of sending a reform bill to Congress 
has not been ruled out. 
  The government has instructed the Army and the police force 
not to reopen roads as a means of avoiding confrontations, a 
decision criticized by farmers and other sectors as a sign of 
the "lack of government authority" and as "goodwill gestures 
that are absolutely useless." 
  Conaie Spokeswoman Nina Pacari already announced that the 
roadblocks will not be removed until the Indians' demands are 
completely met, a position that will give them greater 
negotiating power before the government due to the increasingly 
difficult situation faced by the cities under siege.

  [Text] Quito, 19 Jun (AFP) -- Violent clashes this Sunday 
between Indians and merchants of the southern Ecuadoran Andean 
region resulted in the injury of approximately 20 people by 
blows, knives, and tear gas and the torching of a dozen vehicles 
and an Indian community house, the police have informed. 
  Indians who have been protesting against an agrarian 
development law since 13 June clashed with merchants and 
residents in the cities of El Tambo and Azogues, Canar Province, 
270 km south of Quito, leading the Army to intervene. 
  Journalists from the newspaper EL MERCURIO, which is 
published in Cuenca, near the place where the incidents took 
place, told AFP the Indians had "seized" food from stores and 
markets in El Tambo and Azogues and then tried to boycott the 
weekly fair this Sunday. 
  The merchants and residents organized themselves and 
discovered that a large portion of the food seized by the 
Indians was stored in an Indian community house. They recovered 
their products and torched the house, leading the Indians to 
regroup and confront the merchants. As a result, a dozen people 
were injured, and approximately 10 vehicles were burned. 
  Approximately 1,200 vehicles are trapped north of Cuenca, 
and 
Army soldiers repressed Indians with tear gas in the south of 
Cuenca, near Santa Isabel, 350 km south of Quito. Approximately 
eight Indians were beaten up in the clashes. 
  The agrarian development law spurred the Indians to protest 
throughout the Andean and Amazon regions, except in the area 
north of Quito, where an annual festival is being prepared. 
  The protests consist of highway blockings to impede the 
shipment of food. The government has ordered the public order 
forces to avoid confrontations and has not ordered the reopening 
of the highways. 
  Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran-Ballen will receive Indian 
leaders on 20 June to talk about the agrarian law. According to 
the Indian leaders, such laws provide benefits to business firms 
and landowners, whose farm products are exported to the 
detriment of the benefits which the peasants and small 
landowners used to enjoy.

  [Text] Lima, 17 Jun (EFE) -- Peruvian President Alberto 
Fujimori today said that during the Ibero-American summit in 
Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, Latin America left rhetoric 
behind and took concrete steps toward integration. 
  When speaking of the results of the summit, Fujimori said 
that "the most important thing is that concrete measures were 
adopted and this represents considerable progress toward 
regional integration." 
  "This time the rhetoric was left aside and it was obvious 
that each country was making an effort to form a Latin American 
trade bloc to counterbalance the other blocs that exist in the 
world," Fujimori said. 
  The Peruvian president said that the economic section of the 
final document issued in Cartagena contains several proposals 
"which were planned based on the experience and modernization 
process of the Peruvian economy." 
  As for the political content of the declaration of the 
Ibero-American chiefs of state and governments, Fujimori said 
that the document "insists on the need for the democratic system 
to work efficiently." 
  He also mentioned that "it has been agreed that it is 
necessary to combat all kinds of corruption which, just like 
terrorism, is one of the scourges that hinders development and 
the efficiency of democracy." 
  Fujimori expressed satisfaction over the result of his 
meetings in Cartagena with Ecuadoran President Sixto 
Duran-Ballen and Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada. 
  He and Duran-Ballen discussed several plans that would 
integrate the two countries, such as highways and agricultural 
projects, while he and Sanchez de Lozada spoke about giving 
Bolivia an outlet to the sea through the southern Peruvian coast.

  [Text] Lima, 17 Jun (EFE) -- Peruvian President Alberto 
Fujimori announced today the arrest of a "very important" leader 
of the Shining Path [SL] terrorist group, whom he identified as 
Moises Simon Limaco Huayuscachi. Fujimori said that Limaco 
Huayuscachi was coordinator of the Shining Path's Central 
Directorate and was regarded as "the right arm" of Oscar Alberto 
Ramirez Durand, alias "Feliciano," currently the top leader of 
the Maoist group. 
  The Peruvian president said that Mario Vasquez, known as 
"Comrade Roberto," another ranking leader of the subversive 
organization, was also arrested. He is the one who occupied the 
post of Martha Huatay, who was in charge of the SL's "People's 
Aid" organization. 
  Huatay, one of the main terrorist leaders surrounding 
Abimael 
Guzman, the group's founder, ideologue, and foremost leader, was 
captured shortly after Guzman, who was arrested by policemen on 
12 September 1992. 
  Fujimori told newsmen that both terrorists were captured 
today in Comas district in the northern sector of Lima. He added 
that Limaco Huayuscachi was responsible for logistical support 
for "Feliciano" and said that his capture "will further weaken" 
the Shining Path organization, whose members have rejected the 
peace proposals made by Guzman to the Fujimori government and 
have chosen to pursue the path of violence.

  [Text] Lima, 18 Jun (EFE) -- Alleged commandos of the 
Maoist Shining Path [SL] today attacked the Wiese Bank in Lima. 
It staged other attacks last night against the Banco Continental 
and Banco de la Nacion. The attacks caused damage, but no 
victims. 
  During the attack on the Wiese Bank the terrorists turned 
away retirees, who were standing in line to cash their paychecks 
before the bank opened. Terrorists yesterday staged an attack 
with explosives against the City Hall and a Mormon church run by 
U.S. priests in the city of Huancayo, 415 km southeast of Lima, 
in the central mountain range of Peru. The terrorist attack did 
not cause any casualties, but did cause considerable damage, 
according to National Police sources in Huancayo. 
  With its acts of violence, the Shining Path organization is 
today commemorating the killing of 250 Shining Path members 
charged with terrorism on 18 and 19 June 1986, during the 
administration of Alan Garcia, who remains in asylum in 
Colombia. The killings occurred in three prisons in Lima and the 
port city of Callao after Shining Path inmates staged prison 
riots that were quelled. That date is recalled by the Shining 
Path as the "day of heroism." 
  Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori announced yesterday that 
important Shining Path leaders had been arrested. Among those 
arrested is Moises Simon Limaco Huayascachi, alias "Ramiro," 
alleged number two man in the Shining Path faction headed today 
by Oscar Ramirez Durand, alias "Feliciano." 
  Also arrested were terrorists Mario Vazquez Rojas, alias 
"Roberto," and Walter Tupac Yupanqui Asuquilca. Vazquez Rojas 
led the Shining Path's "People's Aid," which plans and executes 
crimes and attacks by the band, after replacing Martha Huatay, 
who was sentenced to life in prison.

  [Text] Lima, 17 Jun (EFE) -- Political violence in Peru 
caused 39 deaths in May, which shows a slowdown. According to 
analyst Carlos Tapia today, however, this does mean terrorist 
activities will end in the short term. 
  The June issue of PERUPAZ carries an interview with Tapia 
and 
the latest statistics regarding violence in Peru. 
  According to these statistics, 413 people died in May 1992, 
169 in May 1993, and 39 in May 1994. Of the 39 who died this 
year, 11 were civilians, six police and soldiers, and 22 
terrorists and narcoterrorists. 
  Since May 1980, when the Shining Path [SL] started its 
subversive actions, through May 1994 some 27,500 to 30,000 
people were killed. 
  Of this total, 2,459 were members of the security forces, 
11,768 civilians, 12,967 terrorists, and 277 narcoterrorists. 
  Although, according to some commentators, terrorist 
activities have decreased by some 80 percent, this does not mean 
the SL has been dismantled although it is "seriously wounded." 
  PERUPAZ asserts that "`Feliciano's' determination to 
continue 
implementing the SL plan lacks any grounds and has no chance. 
`Feliciano'--Oscar Ramirez Durand--has replaced leader Abimael 
Guzman, currently in prison, a fact that has divided the SL." 
  However, the publication states it is not enough for those 
who are under arrest to show that they are in favor of peace, 
such as Guzman and other leaders, it is also necessary that 
those "who are still up in arms to surrender, repent, and hand 
themselves in." 
  PERUPAZ explains that wiping out the current focus of 
violence is not enough, that "any chances, no matter how small 
they are, that it may resurface must be wiped out." 
  PERUPAZ maintains that "unhappiness, social protests, and 
the 
naive tendency to believe that violence will solve the problems 
of injustice affecting the country" must be eliminated to 
prevent violence from appearing again. 
  For this reason security measures have been stepped up in 
Lima for the eve of 18 and 19 July, when the massacre of 250 
inmates charged with terrorism in three Lima prisons in 1986, 
when Alan Garcia was president, took place. 
  The Shining Path considers these dates the "day of heroism" 
and authorities fear new attacks. 
  Analyst Carlos Tapia says it is "irresponsible" to maintain, 
as Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori does, that terrorism will 
have been wiped out in Peru by the end of his term in office in 
July 1995. 
  Tapia asserted: "It is quite unlikely that the SL, which has 
become a phenomenon with social implications that somehow 
belongs to Peruvian history and has survived for the past 14 
years, will disappear just because the president says so, 
because the social processes do not end from one day to the 
next."

<F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno; from the "Union Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] President Rafael Caldera has said that the most 
prosperous industry in Venezuela is spreading rumors. He added 
that this, however, is countered by reality because our 
democratic system is firm and stable. Caldera made this 
statement during a joint news conference with Portuguese Prime 
Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva at the Yellow House. Caldera 
recalled that recently rumors persistently circulated in the 
country about his presumed death, which had to stop when all 
Venezuelans confirmed that he was totally active. 
  [Begin Caldera recording] I am convinced that the democratic 
system in my country is a firm and stable reality, and will be 
maintained despite all the rumors unleashed by those who are 
interested in creating situations of violence and instability, 
taking advantage of the grave circumstances of an economic 
crisis. We are all aware of the seriousness of this crisis and 
we know that we must make great efforts to overcome it. [end 
recording] 
  Caldera attributed the fall of the bolivar to the wave of 
rumors, which in turn has increased inflation. 
  [Begin Caldera recording] We are fighting against inflation, 
but rumors are the main cause for its increase. We are facing a 
situation of shortages and price fluctuations in which 
speculators take advantage of any factor or announcement that 
the inflation rate is up to increase prices to unacceptable 
levels. We will handle this problem with courage and 
determination. [end recording] 
  President Caldera said that despite the crisis in the 
financial system, the fact that foreign investors are still 
interested in investing in our country is proof that Venezuela 
will be able to overcome this crisis and reactivate its economy. 
  Meanwhile, Portuguese Prime Minister Cavaco Silva said that 
his country is willing to assist Venezuela under the current 
circumstances and to strengthen commercial ties between both 
countries.

<F P=106> [Report by Berenice Gomez Velasquez] </F>
  [Text] Hours before traveling to Cartagena de Indias, 
Colombia, President Rafael Caldera, commander in chief of the 
FAN [National Armed Forces], decided who will be the first 
division generals and vice admirals, as had been unofficially 
announced. The president officially informed Defense Minister 
Division General Rafael Angel Montero Revette to advise the 
promoted officers. 
  The president decided to promote three officers regarded as 
born commanders to the rank of division general, as they were 
described as military men who will be remembered as commanders. 
  Nicolas Valencia Vivas, an AMV [Military Academy of 
Venezuela] artillery branch graduate of the 1967 Lino de 
Clemente Class, is currently the chief of the Army's General 
Staff. He previously served as Army Intelligence director and 
commander of the 61st Infantry Brigade stationed in Apure State. 
He is a Iaeden [Institute of Higher Studies for National 
Defense] graduate. He also held the post of commander of the 
Jungle Battalion stationed in Luepa, Bolivar State, and is a 
lawyer. 
  Pedro Hernandez Guevara, an AMV artillery branch graduate of 
the 1965 Lino de Clemente Class, served as commander of the 52d 
Jungle Brigade stationed in Puerto Ayacucho; commander of the 
Jancito Lara Self-Propelled Group [Grupo Autopropulsado Jacinto 
Lara] stationed in Valencia, Carabobo State; commander of the 
155mm Armored Brigade; director of the Army Higher School; 
commander of the Ayacucho Artillery group; deputy director of 
DIM [Directorate of Military Intelligence]; and is currently the 
Army's logistics commander. 
  James Patro Navas, an AMV infantry branch graduate of the 
1968 Pedro Maria Freites Class, was born in San Cristobal, 
Tachira State. He served as commander of the 1.1 [as published] 
Task Forces at the service of Cufan [expansion not known]. The 
president appointed him commander of the Paratroopers Brigade 
and of 4-F [not further identified] later on. He is currently 
the commander of the 4th Army Infantry Division stationed in 
Maracay, Aragua State. The following rear admirals were promoted 
to vice admiral: Jesus Briceno Garcia, current regional 
personnel director of the Defense Ministry, and Oscar Morales 
Martinez, Venezuelan Navy School director and Navy personnel 
commander. F-16 and Mirage pilots with well-known military 
records will be the new Venezuelan Air Force [FAV] division 
generals. Jose Agustin Borges Blasco is an outstanding and 
highly respected pilot. He is a jet bomber, transportation, and 
fighter pilot. He graduated from the AMV Aviation School in 1967 
with the rank of lieutenant major of the Teofilo Zambrano Class. 
He was born in San Juan, Caracas, and was raised in Catia. Since 
his days as a cadet he distinguished himself as a test and 
training pilot in all the FAV weapons systems. The only aircraft 
he has not flown is a helicopter. He is a graduate of 
Washington's Inter-American Defense College. After Division 
General Maglio Montiel Arguello, he is the Mirage fighter pilot 
with the most flight time in the country. Montiel and Borges 
escorted the Mirage squadron upon its arrival in the country 
from Nellis Air Force Base in the United States after 
participating in the Red Flag maneuvers with F-16 airplanes. 
  The two pilots flew for the president during the FAV's 
anniversary on 9 December, a few days after the 27 November 
uprising, when it was reported that U.S. pilots flew those 
airplanes. Borges is currently commander of FAV Air Operations. 
  Juan Antonio Paredes Nino is one of the country's most 
distinguished fighter pilots. He helped pioneer the F-16 weapons 
system. Since his time at the Military Aviation School, he stood 
out as an excellent pilot. It was always said that "Paredes Nino 
was giving orders from school." He is the son of former Defense 
Minister Fernandez Paredes Bello, an FAV division general. 
Expectations were that at least one general of the 1968 class 
would rise to the rank of division general. Those expectations 
were based not only on merits but on knowledge about what has 
happened in the other branches. The president, however, 
dispelled those notions. It did not happen. The president did 
not expand the number of slots. He promoted two generals who 
were sure bets to the rank of division general. There was no 
surprise. 
  The promoted officers are: Julio Cesar Pena Sanchez, current 
FAC [Armed Forces of National Cooperation] inspector general, 
and Euro Luis Rincon Viloria. Rincon Viloria comes from Zulia 
State and graduated from the Efofac [Armed Forces of Cooperation 
Officers Training School] as a member of the 1967 Taguanes 
Battle Class. He served as deputy director of the FAC Higher 
School, Core [National Guard Regional Command] 5 chief of 
general staff, Training and Environmental and Natural Renewal 
Resources Protection School director, and commander of the 51st 
Mobile Destacafac [expansion unknown]. He served as Core 6 
commander as well as commander of the Apure Garrison stationed 
in San Fernando. He is currently the FAC chief of General Staff.

  [Text] Asked by the Chamber of Deputies' Comptrollers 
Commission about financial aid, FOGADE [Fund for the Guarantee 
of Bank Deposits] President Norys Aguirre reported that with the 
payment of up to 4 million bolivares, announced by Finance 
Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez, 90 percent of the depositors of 
the eight banks in which the government intervened will be able 
to get their money back. She also said that FOGADE will request 
the implementation, as soon as possible, of the Public Credit 
Law, approved by the Congress for 4.15 million bolivares and 
earmarked to cover the payment of up to 4 million bolivares 
announced by Minister Sosa. Aguirre said she never agreed with 
the system that has been applied to handle financial aid. 
  [Begin Aguirre recording] Our dependency on the financial 
system must be taken into consideration. Venezuela cannot be 
left without payment instruments. The procedure to attend to 
this insolvency crisis will be completely different from the one 
used in the case of the eight banks. You have asked me a number 
of times whether I agree with this system. I cannot. Financial 
aid and the insolvency crisis must be handled by the Banking 
Superintendency, which must detect the trouble. Once the 
insolvency problem is detected, the state, because the 
insolvency crisis is general, will take over and assume control 
of the bank's shares. The liabilities, however, which are the 
bank's most valuable possession, will remain intact. [end 
recording] 
  Finally, she explained that the government is not dealing 
with 2 million people affected by the intervention but with 2 
million banking instruments, which does not necessarily involve 
2 million people because one single person may possess several 
instruments.

<F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] According to Bank Superintendent Tesalio Cadenas, 
the opening of banks in which the government has intervened and 
payments to depositors scheduled for next week is still 
uncertain, despite assertions by the finance minister. While the 
FOGADE [Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Law] president 
announced that payments to depositors in these banks will 
commence next week and that the timetable for payments will be 
disclosed this week, Cadenas indicated that the payments can be 
made only if Congress approves the use of 250 billion bolivars 
based on the Law of Public Credit. 
  Once again official spokespersons are contradicting each 
other by not providing the same information to depositors, 
thereby increasing uneasiness. Cadenas said the goal is for all 
accounts to be paid equally, that is, not only savings accounts, 
but also checking, time deposits, cash, and others. With regard 
to the banks that the government has intervened in, he said that 
these could not sustain the large withdrawals of capital by the 
public resulting from a lack of trust. The people, he noted, 
should not listen to rumors. 
  [Begin Cadenas recording] I hope the public will react 
positively to this situation. I am making a sincere appeal to 
people to use good sense and not to be led astray by rumors. If 
the public is led astray by rumors, anything can happen. There 
is no valid reason for [word indistinct] bank can do that. There 
is no reason for this, unless the public loses trust. If the 
public starts to make massive withdrawals, it would be 
impossible...that is, there is no institution that can support 
this, as Paul Volcker, former chairman of the U.S. Federal 
Reserve, said. [end recording] 
  With regard to the differences between the banks and the 
associations to which they belong, such as the Banking 
Association and the Banking Board, Cadenas emphasized that this 
is not encouraging, given the nation's current situation. 
  Meanwhile, contrary to the decision by the Banking 
Superintendency and FOGADE, the national government has decided 
to guarantee that these banks will open their doors on Monday to 
pay savings accounts up to 4 million bolivars. This was stated 
by Guillermo Alvarez, Central Information Office [OCI] minister, 
when reporting on issues discussed at the ministerial cabinet 
meeting held this Thursday at the Miraflores Palace. Alvarez 
explained that the depositors will be protected; however, he 
said that the fact that an answer has been given to the 
depositors does not mean that the Venezuelan justice system and 
the government itself, through the corresponding mechanisms, 
cannot act at a given time, in an attempt to guarantee the 
assets that were wrongly managed. The OCI chief said that there 
are legal mechanisms to take action in this regard, although he 
did not specify whether the state is willing to sue the bankers 
that illegally used the resources provided by FOGADE in order to 
rescue the lost funds. 
  [Begin Alvarez recording ] FOGADE has guaranteed a large 
proportion of bank assets. I cannot say right now what the 
proportion is; I cannot give you the exact percentage. 
Nevertheless, the proportion is large, because those banks have 
[word indistinct] properties and they have securities, 
negotiable documents that can guarantee a substantial part of 
the monies fraudulently managed. This money has not been donated 
by FOGADE; this money was granted as a loan for a specific 
period, as a guarantee to the depositors, as we have mentioned.

<F P=106> [Report by Mayra Chirino Ochoa] </F>
  [Text] Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez denied that 
other banks were confronting liquidity problems and reiterated 
that those institutions in which the government had intervened 
will resume operations on Monday. 
  The explanations were a result of the wave of rumors that 
have arisen with respect to other financial institutions 
confronting problems. According to public opinion, there is a 
list of institutions facing bankruptcy that have been rejected 
for intervention by the finance minister. 
  In brief statements to the press, the finance minister 
overruled the Banking Superintendency's stance with respect to 
the banks' opening again in two months time and said: "Take 
notice of what I am saying, they will open [words indistinct]." 
  Sosa Rodriquez was also asked about repayment schedules, to 
which he reiterated that up to 4 million bolivares would be 
paid, as established by law, and not the 10 million bolivares 
recommended by the Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund 
(Fogade). Nevertheless, the finance minister expressed his 
confidence that account holders will not "withdraw 4 million 
bolivares in one single blow." 
  The minister did not explain how they intend to cover the 
funds once the banks begin to operate, since it had already been 
reported that the funds would be obtained through a 150 billion 
bolivar bond issuance as approved by the Public Credit Law, 
better known as the Emergency Law, which includes a total sum of 
400 billion bolivares. This total amount is intended to be 
enough to reimburse 90 percent of the account holders of the 
eight institutions in which the government intervened this past 
Tuesday. 
  Finally, Julio Sosa Rodriguez was asked about the censure 
vote proposed by the Radical Cause Party parliamentary bloc, 
which, if supported by two thirds of the vote, would force the 
minister to resign. The minister refrained from commenting, 
smiled, and only recalled that a censure vote had already been 
passed against Andres German Otero, an engineer such as himself. 
Mr. Otero was finance minister during the first government of 
former President Carlos Andres Perez. Congress is scheduled to 
vote on the censure motion this coming Tuesday.

<F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno from "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The Cabinet Council held a special meeting on 
Saturday and authorized the issuance of public debt bonds so 
Fogade [Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund] can meet 
the demands of the eight banks involved in the intervention. 
  Guillermo Alvarez Bajares, Central Information Office [OCI] 
minister, made the announcement while reporting on the topics 
discussed at the special meeting. Although he admitted there 
were technical problems involved in immediately paying savings 
account holders at the intervened banks, he did not rule out the 
possibility that these banks could reopen their doors on Monday 
and Tuesday to honor these commitments. He said the decree 
approved by the president will be published in the official 
gazette on Saturday night, a task for which printing press 
personnel have already been designated. 
  [Begin recording] [Alvarez, in progress]...invest 400 
billion 
bolivares at this time. The first investment is 150 billion to 
cover Fogade's demands to meet the requirements of the eight 
banks you already know about. This was the main point on today's 
agenda. This decree will be published in the official gazette 
tonight. As a sign of the urgency with which we have treated the 
case, we have already assigned printing press personnel to 
perform this task. 
  [Unidentified reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Alvarez] Our intention, which was announced by the finance 
minister a few days ago, was to get the banks to open tomorrow 
and resume normal operations. Excuse me, I meant Monday. The 
bank superintendent has said there are technical problems which 
they are trying to overcome and which could prevent them from 
opening on Monday. If they cannot open on Monday, they will open 
on Tuesday. It would be a 24-hour thing, at any rate. There is 
no contradiction here. [end recording] 
  The OCI minister said that if Congress and the executive 
branch have submitted this plan to pay savings account holders 
on Monday and Tuesday, the money does exist.

the funds this bank has disbursed to assist those banks that 
have been intervened. 
  BCV President Antonio Casas Gonzalez is reluctant to 
disburse 
additional funds, but he said there is no other option. 
  The public credit law, which aims to provide funds to 
Fogade, 
stipulates these bonds should not accrue interest and are 
nonnegotiable, but they may be redeemed early.

  [Text] The Venezuelan Credit Bank has requested its 
withdrawal from the National Banking Association because it does 
not agree with statements issued by its official spokespersons. 
This was announced by Venezuelan Credit Bank President Garcia 
Mendoza, who described the National Banking Association's 
communique on the way in which the Executive Branch has handled 
the financial crisis as disrespectful. 
  Mendoza also did not agree with what National Banking 
Association President Jose Bouza Izquierdo said, because 
criticism is not among the duties of that association. Mendoza 
also said that he does not understand how the National Banking 
Association claims it works on behalf of the depositors during 
financial crises because the bankers acted contrary to this.

  [Text] General (ret) Alberto Muller Rojas [currently a 
Senator] has denounced the existence of a plot to overthrow the 
government by reactionary sectors led by former Defense Minister 
Radames Munoz Leon. 
  The senator said his Radical Cause Party has come into 
possession of information regarding the plot and the involvement 
of several active and retired officers, generals, and admirals. 
  Muller Rojas underscored that the coupists have held several 
meetings abroad, particularly in Aruba. 
  "During a meeting with Interior Minister Ramon Escovar 
Salom, 
I gave him this information and told him it might be worth his 
while to examine the flight plans maintained at the control 
towers of La Carlota and other airports for information 
concerning active officers' trips to Aruba on private flights." 
  Muller Rojas said that his disclosures are intended as a 
warning to Venezuelan society to reject the coup and especially 
to career officers, who should adopt measures to prevent another 
coup, which would be harmful to the Armed Forces and the country. 
  Muller reiterated that the government should intensify its 
investigation and reveal the plot, which poses a serious threat 
to public peace considering the country's current situation. 
  Muller Rojas said that approximately eight days ago he saw 
Vice Admiral Munoz Leon at the Tamanaco hotel, where the 
plotters had held a meeting. He said that although he has no 
proof, there is well-founded evidence that implicates the 
conspirators.

  [Text] Caracas, 18 Jun (AFP) -- The controversy regarding 
possible coup attempts in Venezuela heightened this weekend with 
new charges that implicate Defense Minister Rafael Montero 
Revette, despite denials by President Rafael Caldera. 
  Retired Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chavez, head of the thwarted 
February 1992 military coup, charged in a communique to the 
media that Minister Montero Revette conspired last year against 
the then Defense Minister Radames Munoz in an alleged coup that 
did not materialize. 
  "Current Defense Minister Gen. Montero Revette was involved 
up to his neck in the military coup that Vice Admiral Radames 
Munoz was going to carry out last December," Chavez states in 
his communique. The retired military officer also maintains that 
"there is plenty of evidence. The (provisional) government of 
Dr. (Ramon) Velasquez (1993) had the evidence, and his interior 
minister was fully aware of that conspiracy." 
  According to Chavez, the former minister was "protected" on 
that occasion by the ruling political parties, because "a coup 
of that sort would maintain the status quo, corruption, and the 
privileges of ruling political and economic groups and would 
quell the struggle of the people to improve their welfare." 
  Chavez was imprisoned after the coup attempt until his 
release two months ago, when he benefited from a presidential 
amnesty granted by President Caldera, within the framework of 
the Armed Forces' peace process. This amnesty led to the release 
of virtually all those implicated in the February and November 
1992 coup attempts. 
  A few days before taking office last February, Caldera asked 
Vice Admiral Munoz and the ranking military command accompanying 
him to resign. He appointed Montero Revette, who until that 
time was Army commander, the new defense minister. Although, 
with the change in the military high command and release of the 
coupist officers, Caldera managed to maintain a period of calm 
in the military sector for several months, charges of new 
conspiracies surfaced this week. 
  Alberto Muller, retired general and current senator, charged 
that Munoz is preparing a new coup, while Montero Revette said 
that "rightist and leftist" groups are conspiring. Montero 
Revette mentioned Chavez and the "Red Flag" organization, among 
other leftist groups. 
  This wave of rumors was denied this week by Caldera, who 
said 
that "the most prosperous industry in Venezuela is spreading 
rumors." Caldera said: "I am convinced that the democratic 
system in my country is a firm and stable reality." Venezuela, 
which has been a representative democracy for 36 years, 
experienced two thwarted coups in 1992, and since then coup 
rumors have surfaced periodically in the country.

<F P=106> [Report by Ascension Reyes R.] </F>
  [Text] There are rumors in the Senate Defense Commission 
that several Armed Forces commanders are unsatisfied with the 
Commission's new method of evaluating candidates for promotion. 
  The discontent is due primarily to the fact that leading 
military commanders believe the Commission is overstepping its 
authority by requesting documents that had not been previously 
required. They also object to filling out a questionnaire, which 
must be submitted by candidates ranging in rank from lieutenant 
colonel to colonel and from Navy commander to Navy captain. 
Candidates for division general and vice-admiral are excluded 
from this procedure. 
  It seems that Defense Minister General Rafael Montero 
Revette 
also disagrees with the evaluation system used by the Senate 
Commission. The system requires an interview with each 
candidate, some of whom were excluded from consideration at the 
last minute. 
  For its part, the Defense Commission has presented numerous 
objections to the list of candidates presented by the National 
Guard and Army. Several legislators say the lists are unclear 
and have pointed out several contradictions between the "Order 
of Initial Precedence (OPI)" and the "Correction Factors." 
  The senators also disagree with the changes made following 
the initial evaluation and the final results presented by the 
Defense Ministry. They do not understand why in some cases the 
OPI states that the officers have done excellent work, but later 
the candidates are given a negative score and a request is made 
that the candidate be "placed in a post compatible with their 
professional performance" without specifying the person's 
faults. The senators feel there is a contradiction in saying 
that a person is excellent and later downgrading him on the list. 
  The Defense Commission has received more than four cases of 
candidates for promotion who were rejected. Those officers have 
met with the legislators to give them their files. 
<H5>  Veto to Division Generals </H5>
  On another issue, it has been reported that several of the 
names proposed by President Rafael Caldera to be promoted to 
division generals do not have the support of all senators. 
Several senators say the candidates do not merit promotion while 
others who are more meritorious were not taken into account. It 
is thus possible that the legislature will vote against several 
of those promotions.

Representatives and leaders of the transportation sector and 5 
July Cooperative President Eudis Febres, 5 July Cooperative 
Treasurer Saul Verdones, and Jesus Aquiles Rondon, secretary 
general of the Bus Drivers Union, think it is suspicious that 
the protest began with the burning of tires at approximately

  Very few students participated in the incidents. The few 
that 
did are activists of the Democratic Action Party [AD] and were 
led by Eudis Marin. We have no idea how he is connected to these 
incidents. We have learned that Marin is not a student but an AD 
activist.

  [Text] Kourou, French Guiana, 17 Jun (AFP) -- The European 
Ariane 64 rocket was successfully launched from the Kourou Space 
Center in French Guiana at 0407 local (0707 GMT) this morning. 
The rocket put into orbit three satellites, the large 
Intelsat-702 of the International Satellite Telecommunications 
Organization, Intelsat, and two British military experimental 
satellites, 20 and 25 minutes after launch time. This success 
erases the failure of Ariane 63's launch attempt on 24 January, 
which grounded the Arianespace Corporation's rockets for nearly 
five months. 
  A former attempt at launching Ariane 64 aborted on 4 June 
because of a technical problem at the liftoff tower. One of the 
holding arms failed to separate from the launcher's third stage, 
and the computers prevented the rocket engines from firing up. 
  Placed in a geostationary transfer orbit, Intelsat-702, 
which 
weighs 3,695 kg and is the second satellite in Intelsat's 
seventh generation, will fire up its engine in a few days, which 
will put it in the apogee of its orbit and directly above the 
Gulf of Guinea at longitude 1 degree west. The satellite will 
thus be incorporated into the network of approximately 20 
Intelsat satellites that handle most international 
communications. 
  For Arianespace, this successful launch marks the resumption 
of the flights suspended four months ago. The leaders of the 
enterprise that markets the Ariane rockets throughout the world 
hope to carry out 10 annual launches to win a bet that they can 
make 30 such launchings before 1996. 
  The next launch is scheduled to be made on 8 July and 
involves a U.S. satellite, Panamsat-2, and a Japanese satellite, 
BS-3N. These launches are to be followed by those of the 
Turksat-1B and Brazilsat-B1 satellites on 30 July. After 
launching Ariane 64, Arianespace still has 39 satellites, worth 
$3.1 billion, to be put in orbit. 
  Intelsat, headquartered in Washington, D.C., is the only 
satellite telecommunications operator that covers the entire 
planet. The corporation uses approximately 20 satellites in 
orbit above the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. 
  SRTV-1A and SRTV-1B are two mini-satellites built by the 
United Kingdom's Defence Research Agency (DRA) for the British 
Defense Ministry. Those small 45-cm-wide, 45-cm-deep, and 
47-cm-high cubes, which weigh 50 and 53 kg, are designed to 
conduct several experiments over a 12-month span involving the 
static charge on the satellite's outer surface, wear on new 
materials, new solar cells, and cosmic radiation.

  [Text] In a news conference held last night, Manuel Camacho 
Solis read a letter addressed to President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari submitting his resignation as Peace Commissioner in 
Chiapas and announcing his decision to withdraw from political 
activities to devote himself to his family. 
  [Begin Camacho Solis recording] In addition, I am hereby 
announcing that I will not participate in any political 
activities during the present administration. [end recording] 
  He said he will surely be criticized for quitting because he 
did not attain the expected results. 
  [Begin Camacho Solis recording] But we have attained all 
results possible at present. I quit the commission committed, 
more than ever, to peace and democracy. [end recording] 
  Regarding the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] 
candidate's recent remarks, Camacho said this. 
  [Begin Camacho recording] His remarks on the Chiapas 
conflict 
have weakened the political negotiations and the role that I, as 
commissioner, could have continued to play to take new steps 
toward peace. For him, the problem focuses on the fact that a 
petition was answered but not accepted and that, therefore, the 
negotiation process failed. In the current situation in 
Chiapas, the PRI candidate's position and its effects have 
resulted in a kind of censure on my work, all of which makes 
peace even more difficult to achieve. [end recording] 
  Camacho Solis pointed out that it is necessary to view the 
problem, not only in terms of social policy, but in terms of 
political concepts as well, to create conditions for a 
respectable and lasting peace that can be accepted by the 
Zapatist National Liberation Front, thus sparing Chiapas and 
Mexico the social price of a protracted war. Camacho Solis 
announced his resignation in a Mexico City hotel.

<F P=106> [Letter from Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace </F>
and reconciliation in Chiapas, to President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari issued in Mexico City on 16 June] 
  [Text] Respected President: 
  In the past few years, I have served the Mexican Government 
honestly. You know that during these years, I have dedicated my 
best efforts to solving conflicts and finding honorable and 
respectful results capable of strengthening society and its 
institutions. In all cases, I was able to avoid violence. I 
respected the rights of the parties involved. I was able to 
restore calm and create new institutional answers and solutions, 
always preferring political options to the use of force, which 
is unleashed when there is no foresight, no power to resist, or 
no courage. 
  In all cases, I sought results through a responsible 
handling 
of the administration and the economy. Public resources were 
managed honestly. I have never mixed matters of public interest 
with private business. I have never used my political position 
to infringe on the rights of others or on their public image. 
With your continuous support, I was able to face very complex 
local and national problems. I committed myself to respecting 
public liberties, and I fulfilled my commitment. 
  I am leaving the public administration after having held 
important positions during times of tension. I do so with the 
certainty that I have shown respect for the rights of citizens, 
social organizations, labor unions, and the opposition, always 
defending the institutions and public interest. 
  Now, just when we had secured, with your complete support, a 
consolidated truce in Chiapas, my work has been publicly 
criticized, and all sort of resources have been used to express 
this position and turn it into a guideline. 
  In light of the fact that this guideline differs from the 
political strategy for peace used in Chiapas, the possibility of 
coordinating the efforts needed in the new phase in the terms I 
have made public has been eliminated by reason of the nature of 
the current Mexican political system. 
  To maintain the current situation, I suggested that you ask 
the governor of Chiapas State to participate in some of the 
tasks in which I have been involved. The professional 
capabilities of your secretaries of finance, government, and 
foreign relations will ensure that the Chiapas problems in their 
areas of authority are given the appropriate attention. 
  Now, to secure more progress in the peace process, it is 
necessary to consolidate the military aspect, to avoid 
aggravating social conflicts in Chiapas, to carefully supervise 
the political campaign in the Chiapas elections, and to design a 
strategy for the new negotiation phase. 
  If the Zapatista National Liberation Army [EZLN] plans to 
increase its political activities, as can be concluded from its 
recent decisions, the only true way to protect the institutions 
is to produce a new political strategy of decisions, agreements, 
and broad new starts in favor of changes that are capable of 
securing peace. 
  In addition, in order to eliminate the possibility that my 
activities are used as a pretext by saying they generate unrest 
when the fact is that I have dedicated my entire life to the 
search for public peace, I hereby inform you of my decision to 
withdraw from political life and dedicate myself to family life. 
I inform you that I will not participate in any political 
activity during the current administration. 
  I know I will be told that I am forsaking peace because no 
result was secured. No. We have secured all the results 
possible at this time. I am quitting the commission with a 
firmer decision in favor of peace and democracy. My commitment 
to dialogue with the EZLN and the search for a peaceful solution 
is permanent. 
  I am taking your public and private word that I will 
continue 
to enjoy the guarantees I have as a Mexican citizen. I thank 
you for your permanent support and friendship and have faith 
that during the important period our country will experience, 
electoral impartiality will be strengthened and doors will be 
opened so civil society can help reduce tension and so there are 
democratic changes capable of making society feel secure and of 
producing economic growth. 
  I ask you to extend my gratitude to the Mexican Army for the 
support it gave to the political solution in Chiapas. I also 
ask you to thank the members of your cabinet for the support 
given to my mission. 
  I close by wishing you and your appreciated family health 
and 
well-being. 
  Respectfully yours. [no final signature as published]

<F P=106> [From the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Commissioner for Peace and Reconciliation Manuel 
Camacho Solis has presented to President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari his resignation from the commission that led the peace 
negotiations in Chiapas. 
  Camacho thus announced his withdrawal from public life and 
politics during the present administration to devote himself to 
his family. 
  [Begin Camacho recording] I am leaving the administration 
after having held responsible posts in times of tension. I have 
the peace of mind of having respected citizens' rights for 
social organizations, labor unions, and opposition groups, while 
defending at all times the government's institutions and public 
interests. 
  Now, just when I had achieved a bilateral truce for Chiapas, 
with the government's full support, there have been expressions 
of criticism regarding my job. Every resource at hand has been 
used to spread that criticism and to portray it as the 
government's position. [end recording] 
  In a letter, Camacho Solis suggested to President Salinas 
that the peace negotiations in Chiapas be partially taken over 
by Chiapas Governor Javier Lopez Moreno and also by the 
secretaries of finance, government and foreign affairs. 
  [Begin Camacho recording] To achieve new progress in the 
peace process, it is necessary at this time to unite the 
military, to prevent an exacerbation of social conflicts in 
Chiapas, to conduct extremely careful proselytism activities in 
the Chiapas electoral campaign, and to design a strategy for a 
new phase of negotiations. [end recording] 
  Camacho Solis also commented on recent remarks by PRI 
[Institutional Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate 
Ernesto Zedillo concerning the Chiapas issue. 
  [Begin Camacho recording] His assertions regarding the 
Chiapas conflict have weakened the political negotiations and 
the role I could have played in taking new steps toward peace. 
[end recording] 
  Camacho Solis emphasized that the truce agreed on in Chiapas 
has not failed, and it is a mistake to compare it to a delay in 
armed actions. He concluded by saying there are two options in 
this case: the achievement of peace through agreements or 
through war, whereby victory would be achieved through the use 
of weapons. 
  President Salinas accepted Peace Commissioner Camacho's 
resignation. A communique states that the president 
acknowledged that Camacho Solis has always carried out the 
duties entrusted to him with honesty, skill, and political 
conviction. He thanked Camacho for his efforts and 
determination to consolidate peace in Chiapas, adding that the 
San Cristobal talks were an important phase in the effort to 
achieve a political solution of this conflict. Salinas de 
Gortari said that henceforth the negotiations will be 
coordinated by the Executive Committee directed by the governor 
of Chiapas.

  [Text] Mexico City, 17 Jun (EFE) -- Today, President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari tasked Hector Hernandez Llamas with complying 
with the commitments the government made during the peace 
process in Chiapas, in the country's southeastern region. 
  A government source told EFE that Hernandez Llamas "will not 
be the new commissioner for peace and reconciliation," a post 
held by Manuel Camacho Solis, the former Mexico City mayor and 
foreign relations secretary, until 16 June. 
  "It is a different post. We could say Commissioner Camacho 
Solis already did his job. He concluded it, and we are now 
entering a new institutional phase, which is to monitor and 
follow up on the commitments," the source said. 
  This source, who declined to be identified, reiterated to 
EFE 
the Mexican Government does not plan to resume the hostilities 
in Chiapas "under any circumstances" and "does not want to give 
the Zapatist rebels a pretext to do so." 
  "What is next is to comply with the commitments the 
government made during the dialogue in San Cristobal de las 
Casas, during which Camacho Solis offered solutions to the 
demands of the Zapatists, and the government will carefully and 
strictly comply with the commitments," the source added.

  [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, 17 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Chiapas 
Governor Javier Lopez Moreno, upon assuming responsibility for 
the peace process, today called upon the armed group in this 
southeastern Mexican state to resume the dialogue. It is 
"imperative" the negotiations resume. No one should pass up a 
new peace opportunity because otherwise the war will be long and 
painful," Lopez Moreno said in an appeal to the armed group, 
which made its emergence last 1 January in Chiapas. 
  On Thursday, the governor was appointed by President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari as the new person in charge of the peace 
efforts, hours after Manuel Camacho Solis resigned as the 
commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas. "The doors 
are open to dialogue.... the solution exists among us," Lopez 
Moreno stated in this capital, located 1,050 km southeast of 
Mexico City, in an appeal to the Zapatist National Liberation 
Army [EZLN]. 
  On Sunday, the armed group called Camacho Solis' response, 
made during the nine-day dialogue that ended 1 March in San 
Cristobal de las Casas, 1,200 km southeast of Mexico City, to 
their demands as insufficient. The San Cristobal dialogue, 
which occurred under a virtual truce that began 12 January when 
Salinas de Gortari ordered a unilateral cease-fire, has ended, 
the group said, reiterating that it maintains the desire to seek 
a peaceful solution to the conflict. 
  The armed group, which launched the movement to obtain 
justice for the Chiapas Indians, "has unquestionable social 
roots," Lopez Moreno said in his first statements as the new 
director of the peace efforts. The governor invited San 
Cristobal Bishop Samuel Ruiz, who served as a liaison in the 
past dialogue, to resume his task and said that "his experience 
and his moral integrity are indispensable in this new stage." 
  Lopez Moreno read the text of the statement before Hector 
Hernandez Llamas, the executive spokesman for the peace efforts 
in Chiapas, who was instructed on Friday by President Salinas to 
work closely with the governor in this endeavor. 
  Camacho Solis resigned on Friday alleging that purported 
criticism by Ernesto Zedillo, presidential candidate of the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party, was "a sort of criticism" of 
his work, which was later denied by the candidate.

  [Text] Mexico City, 17 Jun (EFE) -- Ernesto Zedillo, 
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) Mexican presidential 
candidate, does not believe his criticism of Manuel Camacho 
Solis was the reason for Camacho Solis' resignation as 
commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas. "My 
reaction parallels that of the Mexican people," Zedillo told the 
Monitor radio newscast when he rejected Camacho Solis' 
insinuations that Zedillo's criticisms prevented him from 
continuing as peace commissioner. 
  On Sunday, Zedillo said the Zapatist guerrillas' rejection 
of 
the government's offers to solve their demands showed that the 
negotiations had been a failure and not a success, as Camacho 
Solis had led the Mexican people to believe. 
  The rebel Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) decided 
to 
reject the proposal the government presented between 23 February 
and 3 March in the dialogue in San Cristobal de las Casas, 700 
km southeast of Mexico City. 
  Camacho Solis resigned last night, considering that 
Zedillo's 
opinions were a vote of censure against his actions as peace 
commissioner. After announcing his resignation, Camacho Solis 
indicated he will withdraw from politics during the rest of the 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari administration. 
  Zedillo said Camacho Solis' decision to resign was 
"personal," indicating he does not know the "political 
objective" of involving him because days before, Camacho Solis 
had said he would soon end his role as commissioner. "It is 
incomprehensible that suddenly, he turns around and does what he 
said he would do, linking it to my remarks," Zedillo said. 
  Regarding the Chiapas insurrection, Zedillo said that in his 
opinion, "the important thing at this time is to continue urging 
the government of the Republic and those who are discontent in 
Chiapas to spare no efforts to reach a permanent and just peace 
for all sides." 
  According to the PRI presidential candidate, the Chiapas 
conflict deserves "political and social attention." Zedillo 
added: "The only way to resolve the problem is through a social 
policy that will deal with the people's demands." 
  The Indian insurrection broke out on 1 January when the EZLN 
violently seized four cities in Chiapas, in a conflict that left 
more than 200 dead in 12 days of fighting prior to a cease-fire 
to negotiate a political solution which, after the EZLN's 
rejection, has slowed down.

<F P=106> [Statement by Ernesto Zedillo, Institutional Revolutionary </F>
Party, PRI, presidential candidate, on 17 June; place not given 
-- recorded] 
  [Text] The peace commissioner's resignation is a personal 
decision. By relinquishing the responsibility invested in him by 
the president of the republic, Camacho Solis made the best 
possible decision both for him and the country. I expressed my 
position on the conflict in that state in San Cristobal de las 
Casas on 21 April. I reiterate it today and quote what I said at 
the time. Just like the rest of Mexicans, I am persuaded that 
peace in Chiapas must be based on dialogue, understanding, 
well-intentioned negotiations, and the best possible positive 
attitude. Peace should be attained through agreements that meet 
the just demands of the dispossessed, always respecting the 
rights of those who obey the law. 
  Once again, all of my party's militant members and I call 
for 
the reopening, as soon as possible, of channels of negotiation 
and understanding that make possible a permanent and just peace 
for everyone. Tolerance and the broadest possible sense of 
justice for all sides involved should prevail in the peace 
process. I hereby reaffirm my full support for the efforts that 
President Carlos Salinas has been making for a peaceful solution. 
  As for the peace commissioner's decision to resign, a 
decision that he links with my dissatisfaction over the EZLN's 
[Zapatist National Liberation Army] rejection of the agreement 
derived from the talks that concluded in San Cristobal de las 
Casas on 2 March, I have this to say: 
  1. My remarks at the time reveal the opinions of many 
Mexicans who had expected a final solution as the result of the 
San Cristobal talks. 
  2. The idea that peace was at hand was bolstered by the 
peace 
commissioner himself on 2 March, when he said this. Quote: The 
formula for peace has been defined. The terms for the peace 
agreements and cease-fire have been clearly established. A 
serious and respectful dialogue, with specific purposes, has 
been held, and there has been a call for in-depth changes in 
Chiapas. I am happy that this conflict was resolved in Mexico by 
Mexicans in a very short time. In addition, the EZLN's demands 
have received answers. 
  3. It is those in the EZLN themselves who rejected the 
proposal stemming from the San Cristobal talks and, therefore, 
undermined the commissioner's efforts. I am confident that, in 
response to the desire, shared by all Mexicans, for a just 
solution, particularly for those who live in a situation of 
misery and neglect, the EZLN will resume talks with the 
government to find solutions leading to permanent peace. 
  4. In the light of the above, it is remarkable that the 
peace 
commissioner attempts to blame my demand for a permanent and 
just peace for his resignation from a responsibility assigned to 
him. In addition, I have learned that before the EZLN's 
announcement and my own remarks, the peace commissioner had 
already commented on his decision to relinquish his post and 
devote himself to other activities. I hereby affirm that the 
efforts for peace must go on. This is a matter that concerns all 
Mexicans, not only one person or group. Given the conciliatory 
disposition of the government and Mexican society in general, 
the peace commissioner's resignation should not serve as an 
excuse for acts of violence. Finally, again I express my 
willingness, as well as that of my party, to contribute to any 
effort that the government and the EZLN deem necessary to 
strengthen the permanent peace process and ensure the 
fulfillment of any agreement signed by the sides involved. 
Thanks.

  [Text] Ernesto Zedillo, Institutional Revolutionary Party, 
PRI, presidential candidate, has demanded the continuation of 
peace talks in Chiapas. Zedillo has said reconciliation is 
something that interests all Mexicans; therefore, this process 
must continue. The presidential candidate also commented on 
last night's statements by Manuel Camacho Solis: 
  [Begin Zedillo recording] I believe that in relinquishing 
the 
responsibilities the president of the republic has given him, 
Manuel Camacho made the best decision for himself and the 
country. It seems strange the former commissioner is trying to 
blame me for quitting when all I did was demand a permanent and 
just peace. Furthermore, I have learned that before the Zapatist 
National Liberation Army issued its communique and before I made 
my statements, the former commissioner had already said he was 
planning to resign his commission in Chiapas and do other things. 
  I hereby reiterate the peace efforts must continue. This is 
a matter for all Mexicans, not only for one person or group. In 
light of the government of the republic and the Mexican people's 
reconciliating spirit, the withdrawal of the former commissioner 
should not be an excuse for the reappearance of violence. [end

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Gil Olmos and Elio Henriquez] </F>
  [Excerpt] San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, 16 Jun -- 
Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia has said his role as mediator and the 
role of Manuel Macho Soils as peace commissioner concluded with 
the end of the dialogue phase between the EZLN [Zapatist 
National Liberation Army] and the federal government in this 
city. 
  In an interview granted to the media this morning, Ruiz said 
"the dialogue between the government and the EZLN, involving the 
commissioner and a mediator, who was accepted as part of the 
dialogue, concluded this phase. Thus, as long as the situation 
remains unchanged, there will no mediation on my part. There is 
no established dialogue between civilian society and the 
government. 
  "After the dialogue was held in San Cristobal, it was 
declared finished. A reaction followed, and that was 
communicated to the civilian sector, and the dialogue between 
the EZLN and the government, strictly speaking, ended. "Thus, 
the role of peace commissioner for dialogue with the EZLN ended 
with the presentation of direct proposals to the requests and 
demands that were made. Upon an appropriate report, as the one 
I believe we will be presenting in due time, that role ended." 
  [LA JORNADA] Could there be another commissioner? 
  [Ruiz] Yes, because there is now another kind of dialogue 
involved. It is no longer an EZLN-government dialogue but, 
rather, a civilian population-government dialogue, and we will 
have to wait and see how this dialogue is established. 
  Bishop Ruiz said the hierarchy of the Catholic Church will 
not participate in the National Democratic Convention (CND), 
called by the EZLN and which might be held in the first half of 
July within EZLN territory. 
  "We are part of history in the making. If there are concrete 
conditions and the entire civilian sector, which is primarily 
Catholic, agrees with it, we will accompany the country to a 
good goal: the search for a transition to a better fate in 
history. We cannot stay out of this. The Catholic hierarchy 
will not attend the convention unless there is a specific duty 
for it to fulfill." 
  He said that from their very first messages, the bishops 
urged people to understand that the Chiapas conflict had a 
national scope. In this regard, the EZLN declaration of war was 
not against a segment of the population, such as the ranchers or 
large landowners, but against the Mexican Army because the 
problem in Chiapas has national scope. 
  During this interview at Diocese Curia, Bishop Ruiz said 
that 
after analyzing the most recent EZLN communiques, it is clear a 
nonresponse to the peace agreements is not tantamount to a 
declaration of war. 
  To the contrary, he explained, "saying no to the agreements 
is not tantamount to saying yes to war. It is a definite no to 
war; a no to war in favor of a civic and nonmilitary solution; a 
no to war because they unilaterally decided (it is now a 
bilateral decision) to extend the cease-fire; a no to war and a 
yes to the peace option through a dialogue. In this case, 
however, a broader dialogue is being called, a dialogue that 
includes the participation of the entire civilian sector."

  [Text] Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas, 
has issued a communique endorsing the efforts that Manuel 
Camacho Solis carried out for five months and six days in favor 
of peace in Chiapas. 
  President of International Consultants Julio A. Millan 
thinks 
the country's economy should not be affected by Camacho Solis' 
resignation. 
  [Begin Millan recording] There are no losers. The people are 
not affected. In addition, all of the candidates still have 
freedom of movement. A citizen has resigned from a post, and 
this is similar to the resignation of any other official. The 
important thing now is to limit to the Chiapas area the causes 
and activities related to the problem. [end recording] 
  Felipe Solis, Federal Electoral Institute executive 
director, says there is no reason for Camacho Solis' resignation 
to affect the 21 August elections.

Manuel Camacho Solis' resignation from the post of commissioner 
for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas. Fernandez de Cevallos 
characterized the decision as very respectable, adding that the 
text of the resignation is serious and dignified. 
  Meanwhile, the Party of the Democratic Revolution in the 
Federal District said the resignation proves that there is a 
crisis within the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party]. 
  Deputy Rene Bejarano said Camacho's resignation proves that 
he is in disagreement with those who want to reduce democratic 
demands to the simplest expression. He warned that Camacho 
Solis' resignation increases the likelihood of renewed 
hostilities in Chiapas at any time.

<F P=106> [Article by Raul Llanos and Roberto Gonzalez] </F>
  [Text] Representatives of the country's business and 
financial sectors have expressed regret about the resignation of 
Manuel Camacho Solis, Chiapas peace and reconciliation 
commissioner, and have said that although economic "adjustments" 
could take place, these will not be serious. Some said the 
country's future looks uncertain, adding that this situation 
could make the government toughen its position toward the armed 
group. 
  Last night, Finance Minister Pedro Aspe refused to make any 
comments on the effects that the resignation of the former 
foreign relations secretary of state may have on the nation's 
financial markets. 
  Meanwhile, Capital Bank President Jaime Weiss pointed out 
the 
former commissioner's resignation will not affect the nation's 
financial markets; however, he recognized there could be some 
adjustments, but these are regular adjustments already foreseen. 
He added Mexican society is strong and mature and will react 
cautiously to this incident. Weiss also added Mexican investors 
still trust the nation's economic progress and have the 
long-term foresight to keep their capital in the country. 
  The National Association of the Processing Industry 
(Canacintra) believes Camacho's departure took place when the 
peace process is at a decisive moment. It stated, however, that 
this departure will have no effect whatsoever on what has been 
attained so far, nor will it prevent the two parties from 
sitting down to discuss and reach peace in Chiapas through a 
consensus and dialogue. 
  "We do not think this resignation will have repercussions in 
the economic and financial arenas because the country has 
suitable people to continue the negotiations that are taking 
place in Chiapas," the president of the National Processing 
Industrialists Association (ANIT) stressed. He added: "It is a 
shame he resigned; I believe he did a great job, taking into 
account the governmental and nongovernmental limitations he had. 
His resignation gives leeway to repressive behavior because his 
role of mediator helped nonrepressive forces assume a passive 
attitude. Questioned about Mexico's political and economic 
future, the ANIT president said that "in general terms, it does 
not look bright." This is why a replacement must be appointed 
soon. As for economic impacts, he said there will be capital 
flight, a bear market, and interest rate increases because the 
resignation has exacerbated the atmosphere of uncertainty that 
reigns in the country. He also said Camacho faced some 
difficulties as he waded through pressure exerted from inside 
and outside the system and from the Institutional Revolutionary 
Party. He stressed: "Ernesto Zedillo's hard-heartedness 
contributed to this situation." 
  Aurelio Tamez, president of the Sales and Marketing 
Executives Confederation, said Camacho's negotiations were 
difficult despite the efforts he made; his retirement is 
regrettable.

  [Text] The Attorney General's Office [PGR] has provided an 
explanation of the allegations, which have appeared in diverse 
national media, that in Ojinaga, Chihuahua, DEA agents kidnapped 
Modesto Lujan Valladares, who was taken to a penitentiary in 
Marfa, Texas. 
  1. No official of this institution has stated that DEA 
agents engaged in the alleged kidnapping of Lujan Valladares in 
Mexican territory, thereby violating national sovereignty. 
  2. It has been learned that Modesto Lujan Valladares was 
arrested on 21 April in Marfa, Texas, near the town of Presidio, 
which borders Ojinaga, Chihuahua. Lujan Valladares was found in 
a vehicle with Victor Valle Lujan, Isidro Armendariz Morales, 
and Samuel Garcia Wilfar, ready to sell 125 pounds of marijuana 
to an undercover agent. 
  3. Nevertheless, the PGR has initiated an investigation into 
the affair, instructing its representatives in the United States 
to obtain detailed information on the case to totally clear up 
the facts for the public. 
<H5>  Regarding Sovereignty </H5>
  Unrestricted respect for sovereignty in our nation and the 
decided struggle against international crime constitute an 
irrevocable commitment, which the PGR reaffirms to guarantee the 
community's security.

  [Text] With the conviction that drug trafficking is a 
worldwide problem that should be attacked jointly, the Mexican 
state has called for the establishment of a common front to 
combat this activity because drug trafficking needs to be fought 
with great efforts and increasingly larger economic and human 
resources, the Attorney General's Office (PGR) has stated. Thus, 
Mexico and the United States must continue to support joint 
strategies without violating the sovereignty of either country 
to combat drug trafficking. 
  During the inauguration of a training course for PGR agents, 
at installations of the FBI Academy in Virginia, the United 
States, Rene Paz Horta, National Counternarcotics Institute 
(INCD) commissioner, said the intensification of efforts and the 
support of other nations strengthen the task of combating drug 
trafficking and related crimes, which he described as "among the 
most serious scourges of humanity." 
  Representing Attorney General Humberto Benitez Trevino, who 
is responsible for counternarcotics efforts in the country, Paz 
said the training of PGR agents will help find solutions to this 
problem and reflects the two countries' willingness to cooperate. 
  During the ceremony to inaugurate courses for PGR agents at 
the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, Paz said Mexico and the 
United States must continue to promote joint strategies, without 
violating the sovereignty of either nation, to fight drug 
trafficking. 
  The INCD commissioner said there is a firm conviction that 
drug trafficking is a worldwide problem that must be confronted 
jointly. He added this experience reinforces the hope of 
establishing a united front to combat this type of crime while 
respecting each other, their ethical values, and the law. 
  He added the Mexican state headed by President Carlos 
Salinas 
de Gortari has promoted the establishment of a common front 
against crime because the antidrug fight requires tremendous 
efforts and increasingly larger economic and human resources. 
  Paz said it is painful to see thousands of human beings, 
particularly young ones, fall victim to drugs. He highlighted 
the need to expand rehabilitation programs for adults as well as 
the people's participation in preventive efforts.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ernesto Zedillo, presidential </F>
candidate for the Institutional Revolutionary Party, in Jalapa, 
Veracruz, by reporter Javier Alatorre at Azteca Network's Mexico 
City studios; from the "Early Morning" newscast -- live] 
  [Text] [Alatorre] Mr. Zedillo, a few minutes ago we read 
details of this antipoverty plan. We can see that it is a very 
ambitious plan. How will the plan be financed? Where will the 
money come from? 
  [Zedillo] Javier, the plan will be financed with money that 
we hope the process of economic growth will begin to provide in 
1995. It will also be financed by better distributing the money 
within the federal government. We are going to do what has been 
done in the past few years; we are going to reallocate 
nonpriority expenditures to those areas of a social nature, such 
as those contemplated in this plan. We are also going to 
finance the plan by asking the civilian population, those 
organizations interested in working to solve this problem, to 
contribute as well. It is a good plan, a plan that can be 
financed. The plan will be expanded as we receive more money, 
without creating inflation, to support the plan. 
  [Alatorre] Dr. Zedillo, do you plan to get money through the 
sale of state enterprises that have not been privatized yet? 
  [Zedillo] The money received from privatizing state 
enterprises will basically be allocated to the fund for the 
promotion of the infrastructure, which we announced last week as 
a suggestion. These would be huge works aimed at unleashing the 
country's economic growth. For the antipoverty plan, we will 
use the fiscal resources that will grow with time and the money 
that we receive through better public administration, as well as 
through contributions from the people. 
  [Alatorre] Dr. Zedillo, we understand that with this plan to 
fight poverty, you will try to help 14 million people who live 
in poverty. I rounded up the figure when I said 14 million; if 
I am not mistaken the number is actually 13.6 million, according 
to the information you provided. Will this represent some 
changes in the economic policy the current administration has 
followed? Will there be new changes? In other words, what will 
you retain from this current administration, and what will you 
change? 
  [Zedillo] Javier, that is a very broad question. Last week, 
I presented my economic plan. At that time, I said it is very 
important that we maintain overall economic discipline and good 
public finances, but that we have to move to a phase of economic 
promotion. We must promote investment to create the new jobs 
that our country badly needs. I have presented an antipoverty 
plan. This is a more ambitious plan. This antipoverty plan is 
possible precisely because we have that material base. This 
will allow us to help many people and implement much more 
specific measures to attack poverty. 
  I believe this policy, the economic as well as the social 
policy I am promoting, is the result of the fact that for the 
past few years very solid bases have been built. It would have 
been impossible for us to set such ambitious goals six years 
ago; however, today we can do it responsibly. 
  [Alatorre] Dr. Zedillo, what happened in Chiapas State is 
perhaps an example of the poverty that exists in some areas of 
our country. Will the plan be a response to this very old 
problem? 
  [Zedillo] Definitely, Javier. Poverty is expressed in 
specific ways. Poor health, lack of food for children and 
mothers, lack of education, lack of the essential services such 
as drinking water, electricity, and sewers, and lack of job 
opportunities. Had the country been capable of developing a 
plan such as this one many years ago, I doubt if today we would 
be regretting those tragic situations that concern us. 
  [Alatorre] Is violence a justifiable response to extreme 
poverty? 
  [Zedillo] Definitely not. I said this earlier this morning, 
and I have said it on several occasions. We understand the 
problem, and we must solve it; however, nothing is an excuse for 
violence or unrest. Mexico is a country that has laws and 
institutions, a country with a Constitution we must all respect. 
  [Alatorre] Dr. Zedillo, we know that you have had a very 
active day. We learned about your program to fight poverty in 
Ecatepec, and we know you are going to be in Veracruz tonight. 
You have a tight schedule for tomorrow as well. Before bidding 
you farewell, I would like to ask you about the incidents at the 
National Autonomous University of Mexico [UNAM] this morning, 
the attacks against the candidate of the National Action Party 
[PAN]. What is your opinion? 
  [Zedillo] It is very regrettable. I do not have the details, 
but I believe it should be condemned. This is something that 
should not be done, but I also believe we cannot make a poor 
overall judgment of our national university because of the 
actions taken by an irresponsible, aggressive minority. I was 
at the UNAM a few weeks ago during a very interesting, 
participatory, and respectful meeting with a considerable number 
of students. But when I was leaving the university, I was the 
object of an act of aggression. It was an act of aggression, 
which by the way, was organized by a party that is participating 
in these presidential elections. I would expect these 
regrettable incidents not to be linked to that party as well, 
otherwise it would represent an intolerable situation that would 
not promote civilized political life in the country, which all 
Mexicans want. I, therefore, condemn this incident. I convey 
my solidarity with the PAN candidate, and I also reaffirm that 
this in no way reflects the true feelings of the UNAM. The UNAM 
is the most important university in the country. Mexico owes a 
great deal to the UNAM, and these incidents of violence in no 
way discredits our highest education center. 
  [Alatorre] We thank you for this interview. You are now in 
Jalapa, Veracruz. We invite you to accompany us here at the 
studios of Television Azteca in Mexico City. 
  [Zedillo] Thank you, Javier, and I will be in your studios 
soon. It will be my pleasure.

  [Text] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro returned to the 
fatherland at 0424 GMT on 17 June from Cartagena de Indias, 
where he participated in the fourth Ibero-American summit of 
heads of state and government. 
  Fidel met Colombian businessmen from the financial and 
investment sectors hours before returning to Havana. Fidel also 
held a comprehensive meeting with those expressing Colombia's 
solidarity with Cuban organizations. During the 16 June meeting 
with those expressing solidarity with Cuban organizations, 
Castro stressed that Latin America still lacks a true sense of 
integration, although the summits help this. 
  He added that the main obstacle to Latin American 
integration 
is the United States, which wants to divide the continent and 
limit its independence. Fidel pointed out that this is why 
Washington advocates bilateral accords, just as it did regarding 
the foreign debt which it negotiated one on one because it does 
not want to face a united Latin America. Fidel also stated that 
the Ibero-American summits are so important that the enemy to 
the north was envious and called another summit in Miami, a city 
which it hopes to turn into the Latin American capital. As in 
his Cartagena address, Fidel reiterated that Cuba is not opposed 
to that summit even though Cuba believes it was cowardly to 
exclude Cuba since U.S. leaders are afraid of words, ideas, and 
the truth. He added that this shows political weakness. Fidel 
pointed out that he would attend if he were invited, even to 
Miami. The organizers, however, have already said that this 
will not happen. He explained that he is not opposed to the 
summit because he expects the Latin American countries to firmly 
defend the region's interests in that forum.

<F P=106> [Remarks by President Fidel Castro during news conference </F>
with domestic correspondents following the fourth Ibero-American 
summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, on 16 June; from the 
"Doing Radio" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] I cannot say that there are paramount differences 
between summits. Progress was made at all of them, and 
altogether they represent something positive. The summits are 
being honed. We are never fully satisfied with everything 
discussed or said at the summits. Yet, the fact that the 
summits are taking place is an important step in Latin American 
history. As I told representatives of the solidarity groups 
today, it is the first time in history that we meet or hold 
meetings...[pauses] This is already the fourth. 
  The summits have gained strength. These Latin American 
summits have become institutionalized. Each one has made a 
contribution, fostered certain accords, and promoted specific 
results. The summits, in general, yield results. They have 
fostered greater awareness, understanding, and a spirit of 
cooperation among Latin American leaders. This is reflected in 
the diverse steps the Latin American peoples are taking toward 
integration. The summits' value does not lie in what is 
accomplished but in what is fostered. The summits have truly 
fostered much. 
  I liked this summit. Guadalajara was first; Rio was also 
good; some things came out of Spain. The Caribbean atmosphere, 
this city's spirit, the hospitality, the quality -- although 
also present in Rio and Guadalajara -- contributed to this 
summit. We felt closer to our climate and character. 
  You can see how important these summits are by the fact that 
they have prompted the Miami summit. Our northern neighbors are 
worried and envious of the fact that this movement continues to 
grow and advance and has attained specific results in 
establishing subregional integration mechanism. Therefore, they 
want to have their own. We do not know if they want to hold it 
annually. Of course, they began by excluding us, which is a 
clear act of cowardice. They fear debate and discussion. They 
fear the truth. 
  They know I would go to the summit even if it were held in 
the very city of Miami. The truth, however, is that they do not 
want to see me there. This exclusion is mediocre and cowardly 
and reflects political weakness. As I explained, however, I am 
not opposed to that summit. On the contrary, we must start 
discussing the issues that ought to be discussed at that summit 
because it is an opportunity. One cannot reject an opportunity 
to have the Latin American and Caribbean peoples go there and 
talk with the alleged masters of this hemisphere. I hope they 
have enough spirit and courage. There are always certain 
courageous men that will express certain truths at that summit 
and defend the many interests of Latin America and the Caribbean.

<F P=106> [Report on news conference by President Fidel Castro with </F>
domestic journalists at the conclusion of the Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia; date not 
given; from the "Evening Information Review" newscast -- 
passages within quotation marks recorded] 
  [Text] After completing his activities in Colombia, where 
he attended the Fourth Ibero-American Summit of Heads of State 
and Government, Cuban President Fidel Castro granted a news 
conference to Cuban journalists who covered this important 
meeting. In his first reply, Fidel said he does not believe 
there were substantial differences between the summit in 
Cartagena de Indias and the previous ones held in Guadalajara, 
Madrid, and Salvador de Bahia. 
  [Castro] "I believe that there have been (?advances) in all 
of them, and that altogether, they are positive. They have 
improved. One is never satisfied with everything discussed at 
the summit, or everything that is said. The mere fact that the 
summits are held constitutes an important historical step in 
Latin America. As I was explaining today to solidarity groups, 
it is the first time in history that [words indistinct]. There 
have been several summits, this was the fourth. These meetings 
have been consolidated and have been institutionalized. These 
Latin American summits have been institutionalized. Each one 
has [words indistinct] and each one ends with specific 
agreements, has promoted specific actions, but they have a 
general [word indistinct]. I believe that a [words indistinct] 
among Latin American leaders has been created, with greater 
understanding, a greater spirit of cooperation reflected in the 
various activities of Latin American countries in favor of 
[words indistinct]. 
  ``We should not analyze the summits only by what they 
achieve, but for what they promote. They have helped promote 
things. In my opinion, these summits are so important that they 
have triggered the Miami Summit. Our northern neighbors got 
worried [words indistinct] specific results in subregional 
integration organizations. Therefore, they decided to call a 
summit; we still do not know if it will be an annual summit. Of 
course, you know what the exclusions are [words indistinct] they 
know that even though the summit is in Miami, I would go [words 
indistinct] I believe this is a cowardly exclusion, which 
reflects the [words indistinct] because it is an opportunity, we 
cannot deny it, of creating a Latin America [words indistinct] 
the presumed owners of this hemisphere. I hope there will be 
enough enthusiasm -- and there is always [word indistinct] and 
enough courage -- and there are always courageous men -- to 
mention some truths in that summit. I hope that the interests of 
Latin America and the Caribbean, which are many, are defended.'' 
  Fidel Castro also pointed out that having given intensity 
to social development issues is one of the modest contributions 
Cuba made to the Ibero-American summits. 
  [Castro] "[Word indistinct] we have made a strong effort to 
raise the summits' spirits and to give meaning to them. I 
believe the Cuban delegation has no reason to be (?ashamed) of 
these statements, and [words indistinct], especially at this 
summit because we are looking at the so-called Miami Summit. We 
already started discussing the Miami Summit. We believe these 
summits have created awareness. Integration awareness is one 
such issue created by these summits. We should measure the 
success of the summits by the number of tangible issues, not by 
the awareness they have created, the rapprochement they have 
generated, or the contacts achieved by the Latin American 
rulers. [Words indistinct] of the Cuban contribution; Cuba has 
made a modest contribution. You were asking about the summits' 
contribution to Cuba. I can tell you they have contributed to 
fighting Cuban isolation, to creating awareness of the blockade, 
to giving a lesson to the United States, and to [words 
indistinct] Cuba's expulsion. Cuba recently improved its 
relations with the rest of Latin America; Cuba has encountered a 
more propitious climate for economic relations and trade." 
  As for the Miami hemispheric summit, the Cuban president was 
asked what issues the Latin America should stress there. 
  [Castro] "We must promote the defense of sovereignty and the 
principle of nonintervention in Latin America. In addition, 
those pretexts used to intervene in Latin America's domestic 
affairs, such as drug trafficking, must no longer be used to 
violate the Latin American countries' sovereignties. We must 
change armies into police bodies. In other words, there is a 
number of economic and political issues that should be stressed 
at the Miami summit. I was thinking that if the United States 
indeed wants to have more mature relations and if it wants to 
close its military bases in Latin America, it should not forget 
the Guantanamo base; the United States should comply with the 
agreements signed to remove all military bases in Panama and in 
any other country. There are security, political, and economic 
problems that must be discussed at this summit. I would say 
there is a world to be discussed there. 
  ``I urge the Latin American countries to discuss these 
issues 
at the so-called Miami Summit. I know very brave Latin American 
and Caribbean politicians. I met them at these Ibero-American 
summits; they are valuable and capable people. I hope they will 
bring these issues up at the Miami Summit. The slogans that 
were uttered from decade to decade and from century to century 
were just lies and more lies.'' 
  To this effect, the top Cuban leader pointed out the United 
States continues to be the biggest obstacle to Latin American 
integration. 
  [Castro] "The United States wants to disintegrate us, 
because 
it opposes true Latin American integration. It wants the 
countries to move forward on their own. [Words indistinct] 
toward integration, the United States is promoting bilateral 
integration among the many Latin American countries. The same 
thing that happened with the foreign debt, when it opposed 
holding negotiations with an integrated Latin America, is 
happening now. The United States refuses to let Latin America 
integrate; it wants to sign agreements with individual countries 
to meet its own interests, thus preventing a true American union 
from forming. One thing, however, is what the United States 
wants, and another is what Latin Americans are doing on their 
own: promoting their own bilateral agreements. 
  ``Mexico is promoting bilateral free trade agreements with 
different countries. It already did that with Chile. Although 
Mexico is a NAFTA member, Mexico also just signed a free trade 
agreement with Venezuela and Colombia, the Group of Three. They 
say the ideas of free trade and Latin American integration are 
slowly making headway.'' 
  Cuban reporters were not an exception and also asked Castro 
about the guayabera shirt he wore in Cartagena, generating such 
great surprise and suspicion. 
  [Castro] "The tale of the guayabera has been quite a tale. 
[Words indistinct] some people disagreed, I mean some of the 
security people. (?A girl) asked why I took off my uniform. 
No, I continue to wear my uniform deep inside, [words 
indistinct] but I am already used to those boots [words 
indistinct] the first day I wore the slacks [words indistinct] 
and yesterday I also (?wore it) so she could tell me I was 
wearing the uniform [words indistinct], and that I was wearing a 
guayabera and slacks as uniform [words indistinct] navy blue 
plants and a guayabera, but I kept the boots. I only took my 
boots off to sleep. [laughter]" 
  [Reporter] "Commander." 
  [Castro] "[Passage indistinct] I did it heeding an 
invitation 
or the request made to everyone. I did not want to (?stand out) 
[words indistinct]." 
  [Reporter] "[Question indistinct]" 
  [Castro] "[Words indistinct] [laughter] I wear my olive 
green 
uniform again. 
  [Reporter] "People in Cuba are [words indistinct]" 
  [Castro] "I can [words indistinct], tomorrow I would not 
[words indistinct]." 
  [Reporter] "You are not going to have the final word. 
[laughter]" 
  [Castro] "No, that does not mean I will never again wear it, 
but (?I may wear it) to some reception [words indistinct] it is 
comfortable. It is truly comfortable. I do not know if [words 
indistinct] Robertico [Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina] 
with a uniform [words indistinct] [laughter]" 
  [Reporter] "[Words indistinct]" 
  [Castro] "I felt comfortable because it is truly hot there 
and [words indistinct] but I think I am going back to my olive 
green uniform. It is an old habit."

  [Text] On 16 June, employees of the U.S. Embassy in 
Port-au-Prince began leaving Haiti for the United States. A 
preliminary group of seven people departed on a commercial 
American Airlines flight. Ambassador Swing took leave of this 
group at the airport in the presence of American journalists 
currently in Port-au-Prince. 
  It should be noted that about 70 members of the families of 
the U.S. diplomatic staff accredited in Haiti, including the 
spouse of Ambassador Swing, are due to leave Haiti before the 
suspension of commercial flights between Haiti and the United 
States on 25 June, and according to information provided by AFP, 
75 diplomats, including Ambassador Swing, will remain in 
Port-au- Prince. 
  It should also be pointed out that U.S. citizens residing in 
Haiti have begun to leave the country under their government's 
recommendation.

  [Text] New York City, 17 Jun (DPA) -- The Guatemalan 
Government and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity 
(URNG) reached an agreement today in Oslo on the resettlement of 
people uprooted by the internal strife that shook the country 
for 30 years, the United Nations reported today in New York 
City. The agreement will not enter into force until the 
government and the URNG sign a final peace agreement at the end 
of this year. The preparatory work for this accord will begin 
in the next 60 days, it was announced. 
  Once the resettlement concludes, the sides will begin to 
discuss the topic of the "identity and rights of Indian 
peoples," which is the next step in the negotiations. This new 
pact, accompanied by the one signed already on human rights, 
consolidates the possibility of bringing to an end the longest 
continuing conflict in Latin America, the United Nations 
indicated.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 17 Jun (NA) -- Economy Ministry 
sources said today that the Economy Ministry will not respond to 
the Brazilian Foreign Ministry's abrupt decision to suspend 
Domingo Cavallo's trip scheduled for the end of June. The 
suspension is presumably due to Brazilian annoyance over 
Argentina's support for Mexican President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari to preside over the GATT general directorate. 
  The unexpected situation surprised the Economy Ministry, but 
the economic team decided not to comment until the situation 
clears up because there are still some conflicting reports on 
the issue. 
  The abrupt cancellation of Cavallo's visit to Brasilia was 
understood as a reprisal because Argentina gave its support to 
Salinas de Gortari instead of supporting Brazilian Economy 
Minister Rubens Ricupero from Rio de Janeiro to preside over the 
GATT directorate. 
  Argentina's support for the Mexican president was made 
public 
by President Carlos Menem during the Ibero-American summit this 
week. 
  The Brazilian press today published the remarks of several 
diplomats saying that the Brazilian Government felt 
"disappointed" at Menem's position, taking into account that 
Argentina is Brazil's partner in Mercosur [Common Market of the 
South] and it knew Brazil had proposed Ricupero for the post. 
  The diplomats also were annoyed because Brazil's seat was 
empty when Menem made the announcement. At the time, the 
Brazilian delegation was accompanying President Itamar Franco, 
who was mourning the sudden death of his nephew and private 
secretary. 
  The Brazilian Foreign Ministry lowered the tone after the 
dust raised by the affair settled and justified the suspension 
of Cavallo's visit by saying it was due to an "incompatibility 
in the agenda."

<F P=106> [Article by Maria Helena Tachinardi from Cartagena, Colombia] </F>
  [Text] The Latin American Integration Association (LAIA) is 
being revitalized by the integration accords in the continent, 
LAIA Secretary General Antonio Antunes said. At its headquarters 
in Montevideo, the organization is hosting meetings of tobacco 
industry workers from Mercosur [Common Market of the South] 
countries and Chile. They want a master agreement on labor 
relations. The universities and media of these countries also 
are approaching each other. There are possibilities for 
concerted action by and consolidation of Mercosur and the Andean 
Pact. Antunes said that negotiations also have their crises. He 
did not rule out the possibility that subregional groups may in 
the future have a preferential relation with the United States 
and countries outside the region. 
  The LAIA Council of Ministers has decided to draw up a 
program of action seeking to coordinate the Andean Group, 
Mercosur, and the various bilateral and multilateral agreements. 
The idea is to make those agreements lead to a Latin American 
common market. In this regard, the proposal for the creation of 
a South American Free Trade Area (SAFTA), which was raised by 
Brazil and has been endorsed by Mercosur countries, is a major 
contribution, Antunes said. 
  In August, LAIA will have to make suggestions for this 
higher 
integration phase that its members are looking for. To this end, 
it will need a set of commercial regulations with antidumping, 
origin, and customs rules. "That is the initial step," Antunes 
said. 
  The organization also is working to define rules for 
transportation and for new subjects like the sale of services, 
intellectual property, and capital movements. Mexico itself, 
which usually has criticized LAIA, believes the organization is 
modernizing, as Mexico's main NAFTA negotiator, Herminio Blanco, 
admitted a few days ago in London during a seminar on relations 
between the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and Latin 
America, Brazilian diplomatic sources said. 
  The protocol that interprets Article 44 and the program of 
action have meant a qualitative step forward for LAIA, Antunes 
said. 
  LAIA, he said, is on its way to becoming a regional GATT. 
The 
organization will create a labor council, promote a second 
meeting on consumer rights, and continue its business talks, 
encouraging major entrepreneurs of signatory countries to invest 
in smaller countries in order to export to their own countries. 
  Antunes' conclusion is that the expansion of commerce 
produces the need for integration and instruments for regulating 
commerce, like fair competition rules. Mexico itself, which 
requested a solution for its problem within LAIA -- because it 
is also a NAFTA member -- is negotiating bilateral and regional 
free trade agreements with several countries, expecting its 
profits to surpass the compensation it will have to offer. 
  Greece and South Africa have asked to be accepted as 
observers to LAIA. China is in the final stage of the process of 
being accepted as an observer, while Romania already has been 
granted the status of observer. Antunes said LAIA is trying to 
negotiate the status of observers in exchange for cooperation 
agreements with the observer countries, thus guaranteeing the 
future possibility of signing trade accords with LAIA members.

  [Text] Lima, 16 Jun (EFE) -- Venezuelan Congressman Paciano 
Padron, the president of the Andean Parliament, stated today 
that the Andean Parliament is opposed to the commercial blockade 
against Cuba and Haiti as a way to restore democracy in both 
countries. 
  In remarks to the magazine CCD [Democratic Constituent 
Congress], the official mouthpiece of the Peruvian Congress, 
Padron said: "It is a bad idea to continue the blockade against 
Cuba and Haiti because the people have the right to survive and 
subsist." 
  The Andean Parliament president said: "It is not ethical to 
submit a nation to starvation in the name of democracy." 
  Padron added that commercial blockades, like that imposed 
recently on Haiti and the one that has prevailed for 32 years 
against Cuba, "affect the people, not the generals or officials 
who continue drinking wine and eating meat while the people have 
nothing to quench their thirst or assuage their hunger." 
  The Venezuelan congressman asked the OAS to find a political 
solution to the Haitian and Cuban problems and to conduct all 
necessary diplomatic negotiations "instead of settling for less 
humane alternatives."

  [Text] Brasilia, 17 Jun (AFP-NA) -- The Brazilian Foreign 
Ministry on 17 June expressed its malaise over the stance taken 
by Argentina during the Ibero-American Summit of heads of state 
and government held in Cartagena de Indias (Colombia) last week 
concerning its endorsement of Mexican President Carlos Salinas 
de Gortari as a candidate for the GATT presidency. 
  Notwithstanding this, a Brazilian diplomatic spokesman told 
AFP NEWS AGENCY that the suspension of Argentine Economy 
Minister Domingo Cavallo's visit to Brasilia -- scheduled for 
the end of June -- until July was a "coincidence" and had 
nothing to do with the other issue, as had been hinted at by the 
local press on 17 June. 
  The Itamaraty (seat of the Brazilian Foreign Ministry) 
spokesman reported that having officially announced the 
candidacy of Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero for GATT's 
presidency on 7 June, the Brazilian Government informed its 
Latin American counterparts. 
  On that occasion, Argentina and Mexico -- without making any 
type of commitments -- allegedly had been in favor of Ricupero's 
candidacy to replace Irishman Peter Sutherland. 
  This is why it was considered in "poor taste" that another 
candidate was proposed and supported in the absence of the 
Brazilian delegation (when President Itamar Franco left the 
summit due to the unexpected death of his nephew and private 
secretary, Ariosto Franco). 
  The same source said, nonetheless, that this will neither 
affect Brazil's good relations with Argentina nor the Common 
Market of the South [Mercosur] integration process, nor 
negotiations on the establishment of a South American Free Trade 
Zone sponsored by Brazil. 
  The suspension of Cavallo's trip to Brazil was made at the 
request of the Brazilian Finance Ministry, which at the time 
originally scheduled for his visit -- the end of June -- will be 
putting the final touches on the implementation of the new 
currency at par with the dollar -- the real -- scheduled for 1 
July. 
  Cavallo's visit surely will take place at the end of July 
after the Mercosur summit in Buenos Aires that will be attended 
by Argentine President Carlos Menem, Brazilian President Itamar 
Franco, Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy, and Uruguayan 
President Luis Alberto Lacalle.

<F P=106> [Speech to the nation by President Cesar Gaviria; place not </F>
given -- live] 
  [Text] Colombians: In spite of our sadness, I want to speak 
briefly with you tonight to tell you that we must not lose our 
faith and hope. This country has known how to successfully face 
adversity in the past. I am sure that as long as we don't lose 
confidence in our potential, we have what it takes to come out 
winning. 
  Once again, I reiterate my invitation to my fellow 
countrymen 
to exercise their constitutional right to vote in tomorrow's 
election. It is the duty of each and every Colombian who is 
eligible to vote. The right to vote is free and voluntary. It 
is a reaffirmation of our democratic and participative vocation. 
He who votes must do so based on his own dictates and 
convictions. This is a right that makes us masters of our fate 
and interests. 
  We again have before us the opportunity to participate in 
the 
presidential election; the most important political decision in 
our country for the next four years. The runoff mechanism is 
another result of the important changes introduced by the new 
Constitution. The National Government will once again ensure 
total and complete impartiality and will exert strict control to 
guarantee transparency in the development of these elections. 
We will demand that political parties, the media, and citizens 
fully comply with the existing norms on behavior. Any attack 
against the right to vote freely will be severely punished as 
stipulated by the law. 
  Compatriots, we are experiencing moments of great enthusiasm 
and credibility in the country. We have again overwhelmingly 
demonstrated our solidarity when thousands of Colombians 
suffered the unexpected and brutal attack by nature a few days 
ago. Although our team lost its first game, we have faith, 
trust, and conviction that it will recover in the games to come. 
Victory alluded us today, but we are sure that our boys will 
know how to achieve the results we all hope for. 
  The faith, trust, and conviction we have in them is what we 
must show at the elections tomorrow. I hope that the force 
accompanying the Colombian team will be equaled by that which is 
deposited in the ballot boxes in every corner of our nation. As 
president, I address my fellow countrymen and invite them to 
vote with the assurance that you will exercise your right to 
freedom appropriately. Thank you and good night.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Cesar Gaviria by unidentified </F>
domestic reporters at Bolivar Plaza in Santa Fe de Bogota upon 
his voting in the presidential elections; broadcast in progress 
-- live] 
  [Text] [Gaviria] ...in Colombia's democracy. Whoever is 
elected will have the support not only of the president but of 
all the Colombian people. 
  [Reporter] Is the secretary general of the OAS concerned 
about Haiti? 
  [Gaviria] The situation in the country is pretty good. I 
think we are going to have a day when the Colombians will be 
able to freely say who they want to be Colombia's next 
president. This is Colombians' most important decision, which 
they make every four years. I trust that all the Colombians 
will fulfill this sacred duty. We will adopt a decision that is 
important for ourselves, for our children, and for future 
generations, in order that the country may continue gaining 
credibility and trust. This is a process in which we must make 
progress diligently. 
  The fact that elections are being held in this environment 
represents significant progress when compared to sad times in 
the past. 
  [Reporter] What about the soccer defeat? 
  [Gaviria] I feel sad about it, like all Colombians. I hope 
that in the two remaining games the team will recover its 
potential and capabilities, leave behind past problems, and 
resolve future problems so that we may secure victories in the 
two remaining games. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] 
  [Gaviria] It is very probable. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] 
  [Gaviria] Yes. I think it is a disturbing factor, but I 
think the citizens know that voting is not just a right, it is 
also an obligation. The decision to be made today is too 
important to ignore for soccer-related reasons. 
  [Reporter] As secretary general of the OAS, are you 
concerned 
about the situation in Haiti? 
  [Gaviria] We Colombians do believe that the Colombian people 
will vote and [words indistinct].

<F P=106> [From "The Voz Andes Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] Quito -- President Sixto Duran-Ballen has signed 
into law a controversial amendment to the Agricultural Reform 
Law, despite the Indian communities' threats to demonstrate 
until the amendment is repealed. The bill proposed is meant to 
modify agrarian reform to increase the country's agricultural 
production. The Indian and peasant communities, however, think 
the new measure is harmful because it offsets the agrarian 
reform's increased benefits and empowers the government to 
confiscate land presently owned by Indians and hand it over to 
wealthy landlords. 
  Before the bill was approved, Indian organizations closed 
roads and organized marches to the Congress. Now that the bill 
has been signed into law, the Confederation of Indian 
Nationalities of Ecuador [CONAIE] threatens to intensify the 
protests until the law is repealed. Traditionally, the Indians' 
protests have been marked by the closure of highways and 
confrontations with the police but without excessive violence.

<F P=106> [Report by Josefina Blanco] </F>
  [Text] A warm afternoon and a superb view of Mount Avila 
greeted Portuguese Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva. A UH-214 
Army helicopter took the Portuguese premier and his entourage 
from the Maiquetia Airport to the General Francisco de Miranda 
Air Base in La Carlota. The group included Foreign Minister 
Jose Durao Barroso, Commerce and Tourism Minister Fernando Faria 
de Oliveira, and Luis Sousa de Macedo, secretary of state for 
Portuguese communities. 
  Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera received the 
distinguished party with words that recalled the long and close 
relations between both countries and the beneficial presence of 
the large Portuguese community in Venezuela: "....the Portuguese 
presence in Venezuela has without doubt proved to be very 
positive," the Venezuelan president said. Both leaders met at 
the recent Ibero-American Summit held in Cartagena de Indias, 
Colombia, at the beginning of this week. 
  The Venezuelan reception committee included Foreign Minister 
Miguel Angel Burelli, Tourism Minister Herman Luis Soriano, and 
Armed Forces Commander Otto Garcia. 
  Upon his arrival, Cavaco Silva, who is 54 years old, has a 
degree in finance, is a professor and member of the Social 
Democratic party (PSD), and is visiting this country for the 
first time, highlighted the importance of his four-day mission 
in Venezuela. He comes, he said, to strengthen the existing 
political, cultural, economic, and business relations between 
both countries. The head of the Portuguese nation said he was 
accompanied by 50 of the most important and significant 
businessmen in his country. 
  Cavaco Silva also said that he visited the country as a 
member of the European Union (EU) and that the talks would thus 
cover the strengthening of relations between the EU and the 
Latin American countries, taking into account the fact that 
Venezuela has played an important role in furthering integration 
in the region. 
  Cavaco Silva's presence in Venezuela will seal three 
cooperation agreements between both countries. One is a two-way 
investment and protection agreement, another will cover the 
prevention, control, and surveillance of drug use, and the third 
is for technical cooperation in several fields such as 
agriculture, fisheries, tourism, and maritime transportation.

  [Text] Mexico City, 19 Jun (EFE) -- Jose Horta, director of 
the Havana Film Festival, informed EFE today of his decision not 
to return to Cuba after being mistreated by the police of his 
country. Horta, who is also international relations director of 
the Cuban Institute of Arts and Motion Picture Industry (ICAIC), 
told EFE that the police arrested him on 18 June as he was 
leaving the Havana airport on his way to Mexico. He said he was 
taken off the plane twice while the police thoroughly searched 
his luggage. He said the Cuban authorities later refused to 
return his passport. 
  The reason for his trip to Mexico was to promote the New 
Latin American Film Festival, which is held in Havana every 
December. "This situation has been humiliating. I never 
thought I would ever abandon Cuba, but this abuse is 
intolerable. I do not know if this is part of the prevailing 
wave of repression in the country, but I will not tolerate it 
any longer," he said. 
  Horta, who has been director of the film festival for four 
years and has participated in its organization for the past 16 
years, said he has not yet decided whether he will request 
political asylum in Mexico or if he will travel to the United 
States. 
  Roberto Casin, former PRENSA LATINA director in Mexico, 
defected in May 1991 while in Mexico and later traveled to 
Miami, the United States.

  [Excerpts] Paraguay demanded true integration during the 
Fourth Ibero-American Summit of heads of state and governments 
held in Cartagena, Colombia. President Juan Carlos Wasmosy also 
defended the right to life and stated his opposition to 
abortion. The report on the president's activities in Cartagena 
is summarized by SNT [Sistema Nacional de Television] special 
correspondents Andres Caballero and Pedro Colman. 
  Cartagena implemented extreme security measures to assure 
security during the summit. Without a doubt, the first 
appearance of a civilian Paraguayan president at a summit and 
the change of Fidel Castro's military uniform for civilian 
clothes were noted by presidents and the press. 
  The international forum mainly discussed matters pertaining 
to trade and integration as factors for Ibero-American 
development. Wasmosy talked about Paraguay's need for an outlet 
to the Pacific Ocean because of the country's landlocked 
situation. [passage omitted] 
  President Wasmosy discussed the matter with the presidents 
of 
Chile, Peru, and Bolivia trying to find a solution. 
  [Begin Ruben Mengarejo, Paraguayan ambassador to the OAS, 
recording -- in process] ...an outlet to the Pacific Ocean 
through a road to Antofagasta. Chile's president, through his 
foreign minister, committed his country's effort to finishing a 
stretch of the road -- Paraguay will finish another stretch -- 
connecting Mariscal Estigarribia and Pozo Hondo to a corridor to 
the Pacific Ocean. [end recording] [passage omitted] 
  All presidents participating in the summit are staying at 
the 
Cartagena Hilton Hotel. There Wasmosy met Spanish Prime Minister 
Felipe Gonzalez and King Juan Carlos. 
  [Begin recording] [Wasmosy] He [Felipe Gonzalez] will visit 
Paraguay between August and September. He will visit the Jesuit 
ruins, our dams, and other areas of the country. We also have 
agreed to establish a scholarship system for Paraguayan graduate 
students. We explained to them our project to regulate the 
Paraguay River's flow near Bahia Negra on the border between 
Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay. It is a project that seeks to 
regulate water flow, establish an irrigation system, maintain 
the ecology of the swampy area in the north, and permit the 
navigation of the Paraguay River, which also will benefit 
Argentina and Uruguay. 
  [King Juan Carlos] I visited Paraguay not long ago. I have 
been talking with my namesake [Juan Carlos Wasmosy], and I hope 
I will be able to return soon. The president has invited me, and 
I hope I will be able to include the country on my agenda, which 
has to be worked out in accordance with the Spanish Government, 
which decides on my plans. [end recording] 
  Wasmosy also talked with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria, 
who was accompanied by his assistants. Gaviria said he will help 
Paraguay from his position at the OAS. 
  [Begin recording] [Gaviria] Many American countries require 
cooperation, particularly technical cooperation, and other 
programs that help the OAS fulfill its mission. 
  [Wasmosy] He knows I have been one of those who worked for 
his election to the OAS before other presidents. I think 
Paraguay will have relevant participation in the OAS. [end 
recording] 
  Wasmosy also met Chilean President Eduardo Frei. The two 
presidents discussed investments and Mercosur [Common Market of 
the South]. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Did President 
Wasmosy put any conditions on Chile joining Mercosur? 
  [Ambassador Melgarejo] The overall wish is...[pauses] The 
problem is the way the treaty is written. We are studying the 
possibility of introducing changes into the treaty to permit the 
entry of Chile and Bolivia, as the president....[end recording] 
  Wasmosy also met Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran Ballen. 
Duran Ballen confirmed he will visit our country next September. 
  [Begin recording] [Duran Ballen] I want to visit Paraguay 
after the Rio meeting [reference unknown] in September. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What issues interest you, for 
instance? 
  [Duran Ballen] We are interested in learning something about 
cattle raising; Paraguay has had great success in this area and 
the area of energy. We are all acquainted with the large 
hydroelectric projects in Paraguay. We want to learn something 
from that experience. [end recording] 
  Wasmosy also met Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro. The 
two presidents talked about problems affecting cotton 
plantations and possible solutions. [passage omitted] 
  Wasmosy talked with Cuban President Fidel Castro on various 
occasions. He asked Castro not to send instructors in guerrilla 
tactics to Paraguay any more. According to Wasmosy, Castro 
answered that he was only helping the Paraguayan people without 
hurting the Paraguayan Government. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Do you continue to 
justify his economic isolation despite the suffering of the 
Cuban people? 
  [Wasmosy] We do not support any blockade. What we have asked 
him for is an agreement, a proposal -- to give it a name -- 
permitting an increased opening and more freedom in his country. 
[end recording] [passage omitted] 
  Various presidents agreed in pointing out that these 
meetings 
must produce more concrete results or more immediate 
resolutions. Otherwise, people will continue thinking that these 
types of summits are simply social meetings for the heads of 
state and government.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 20 Jun (AFP) -- Liberal Ernesto 
Samper, Colombian president-elect, announced today that he will 
propose the creation of a binational cooperation commission with 
the United States to adopt joint strategies against drug 
trafficking. Samper added that he will accept "any technical 
support from this country" in that effort. 
  In a news conference with the foreign media in Colombia, 
Samper, who was elected president on Sunday after narrowly 
defeating his opponent, Conservative Andres Pastrana, insisted 
on the need to fight drug trafficking in a "global" and 
"comprehensive" manner. "We are not the perpetrators but the 
victims of drug trafficking," he said, lamenting the fact that 
the international community continues to think the drug 
trafficking problem is exclusive to Colombia. He said "it is 
imperative that we ensure greater effectiveness in the 
cooperation between Colombia and the United States" in this area. 
  Samper said the creation of a Colombian-U.S. commission, 
which would be made up of government and civilian 
representatives, would focus on permanently reviewing the 
cooperation policy, strengthening mutual trust, and ensuring the 
effectiveness of the various police, prevention, and 
rehabilitation programs. 
  He said the commission would work toward overcoming 
difficulties encountered by the two countries in their struggle 
against drug trafficking mafias, one example being the situation 
created by a recent Washington decision to withhold information 
obtained through U.S. radars in Colombia. Samper said he hopes 
to maintain "clear, frank, honest, and firm cooperation" with 
the Clinton administration in the struggle against drug 
trafficking. 
  As for U.S. military aid to fight mafiosos in Colombia, 
Samper said he welcomes "any U.S. technical support for our 
counternarcotics efforts." He also reaffirmed his disapproval 
of a recent ruling by the Constitutional Court legalizing the 
possession and consumption of minimum drug dosages in Colombia 
and announced that he is studying two legal alternatives to 
close the door on that ruling of the highest court, which is 
tasked with protecting the political Constitution. 
  Samper said he is studying the possibility of calling a 
referendum, as proposed by outgoing President Cesar Gaviria, or 
issuing a law to ban the use of drugs. 
  Samper, who will assume office on 7 August, announced he 
will 
maintain the voluntary surrender policy for drug traffickers 
implemented by Gaviria but will introduce certain changes, 
especially in terms of the sentences imposed on capos who decide 
to surrender. 
  Samper said he will make the sentences tougher and will not 
allow mafiosos to take advantage of the accumulation of sentence 
reductions specified in the prison code for common criminals. 
Finally, the Colombian president-elect demanded "strong 
international cooperation" in the struggle against drug 
trafficking.

  [Text] President-elect Ernesto Samper has talked about the 
internationalization of the economy. Judging from statements he 
made during the campaign, this internationalization will stress 
a strong policy to promote exports, and this policy will 
undoubtedly be based on a rectification of the policy on 
currency exchange. To this effect, working in coordination with 
the board of directors of Banco de la Republica will be 
necessary. 
  The new president will appoint two new members of the seven 
member monetary board in addition to the finance minister, 
totaling three out of seven people. The new president will need 
to have the concurrence of at least one additional board member 
in order to adopt the necessary currency exchange modifications 
to strengthen exports. It will be, therefore, a policy of 
opening up to international markets.

<F P=106> [Interview with President-elect Ernesto Samper and Andres </F>
Pastrana, the defeated New Democratic Force presidential 
candidate, at unspecified locations by studio announcers and 
reporters; from the "QAP" newscast -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Ines Maria Zavarain] Good evening. Ernesto 
Samper Pizano is the new Colombian president-elect. He won over 
his contender Andres Pastrana by a margin of more than 132,000 
votes. He is our special guest this evening. Good evening, Dr. 
Samper. 
  [Samper] Good evening, how are you doing? 
  [Zavarain] Very well, thank you. Tell us, when you awoke 
this morning, what was the first thing that came to your mind? 
Perhaps you thought it had all been a dream? 
  [Samper] Well, no. I felt as if a piano had been lifted off 
my head and an organ had been placed there instead. [sentence as 
heard] It was a sensation that is very difficult to describe. 
  [Zavarain] Victor Javier Solano has a question for you. 
  [Solano] Dr. Samper, I have a question on soccer and 
politics. Your campaign, at the last minute, used the figure of 
Pibe Valderrama, but it is obvious that that player was not able 
to get the team ready to face Romania in the World Soccer Cup 
game. How can you guarantee that you will get your team ready 
with the best? 
  [Samper] Well, I think that what happened to Pibe was a bad 
afternoon. Pibe continues to be the best soccer player in 
Colombia. I will follow his guidance on how to form teams to 
give the next Colombian administration a team of young people 
who are capable and honest, a polytechnical team. In other 
words, not only a technical team, but one that it will assume 
political responsibilities. 
  [Martha Lucia Avila] [Words indistinct] can you tell us? 
  [Samper] I am sorry; I was unable to hear you well. 
  [Zavarain] Go ahead Martha, ask your question. 
  [Avila] Dr. Samper, we would like to know who you missed in 
this campaign? Who would you have liked to share this triumph 
with? 
  [Samper] That is a good question. Perhaps I missed my 
father, from whom I learned a lot, such as his teachings about 
honesty and values. Also, I missed Luis Carlos Galan, who is 
permanently in my thoughts. I remember him with special 
affection today. 
  [Zavarain] Maribel do you have another question for Dr. 
Samper? 
  [Maribel Osorio] Yes, Dr. Samper. You called for and 
received the support of the alliance for Colombia. Does this 
mean that during your government, we will see a Conservative, an 
Anapista, a Christian, a representative of the black sector, a 
General Maza, or how will you resolve the problem of these 
alliances? 
  [Samper] Well, the truth is that all of these independent 
sectors that accompanied me did so very loyally. I think they 
contributed to my victory yesterday. Of course, they will have 
a place in the government. That place, however, is not only 
that they will be able to have a representative position in the 
government, but also they will share in the government's project 
of social investment, of increasing productive jobs, of the 
peace project, on which we started working this very morning. 
They will be involved in the next administration's project. 
  [Osorio] Let us return to the topic of the ministers and we 
will ask you to give us a name, of the government minister or 
the defense minister, for instance. 
  [Samper] If I could give you these names, I would gladly do 
so. The truth is that forming a cabinet is like playing chess. 
If you miss one of the plays, you mess up your whole game, so 
you are going to have to wait awhile to learn the names. 
  [Osorio] Dr. Fernando Botero, for instance, has come up as 
defense minister. Is that right, can you tell us something? 
  [Samper] He meets all the conditions for an excellent 
defense 
minister. 
  [Zavarain] Dr. Samper, Adriana Larota has a question from 
Los 
Angeles. Go ahead, Adriana. 
  [Larota] Mr. President [as heard], good evening. Now that it 
is almost time for the whistle to be blown to start the game, 
what do you think? Are you going to be an offensive or a 
defensive player? 
  [Samper] Well, I will be on the offensive, but not on the 
basis of fouls, corners, side throws, or out of bounds, but a 
clean offensive, like that carried out by our Colombian team, 
with a lot of plays and passes to make many goals for the many 
problems that afflict Colombians. 
  [Zavarain] Dr. Samper, continuing with the topic of soccer, 
as Pibe Valderrama says, everything is fine. Is everything fine? 
  [Samper] Everything is fine, everything is fine. 
  [Zavarain] All right, Dr. Samper, we ask you to stay with us 
because we will return to you later in the cast. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Zavarain] We now welcome Dr. Andres Pastrana. Good 
evening, Dr. Pastrana. 
  [Pastrana] Good evening. 
  [Zavarain] We have invited you to pay tribute to your 
campaign. After all, you received 3.5 million votes, the 
highest number of votes received by a conservative candidate in 
our history. We would like to know what you plan to do with all 
that electoral support. 
  [Pastrana] I will continue working. The Colombian people 
have given me a mandate of 3.5 million votes, which is 50 
percent of the vote. Those 3.5 million votes are sending us a 
message. They say that change is possible, that it is possible 
to defeat the old policy, the machinery. They are telling us 
that the country wants to build a new Colombia. Therefore, we 
will work hard with those 3.5 million Colombians, and many more, 
to build the Colombia we want so much. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Good evening, Dr. Pastrana. Last 
night, after acknowledging the partial results of the elections, 
you made a statement that has given rise to many doubts. I 
invite you to hear the recording. 
  [Pastrana] Let us hear it. 
  [Begin Pastrana recording] That is why I assured the country 
that a president who has received money from drug traffickers 
has no moral authority to lead Colombia. [end recording] 
  [Reporter] Dr. Pastrana, what exactly did you mean? 
  [Pastrana] You know that since Friday I have been deeply 
concerned because, a week ago, the international media -- TIME 
magazine, and other U.S. media -- published reports hinting that 
drug money was being used in the political campaign. During the 
previous campaign there were 18 candidates, and I insisted that 
we all should send a note to the U.S. Government demanding 
clarification of who they were referring to. Later on, when 
only Dr. Samper and I were campaigning, the media insisted on 
saying that there was money from drug trafficking. Therefore, I 
sent a letter to Dr. Samper to tell him -- as I said in my 
letter -- that I have no knowledge of any funds from drug 
trafficking used in my campaign. Therefore, I swear before God 
and my conscience that I can say to Colombians that there were 
no such funds. I believed a reply to my letter from Dr. Samper 
was important to tell the world that there was no money from 
drug trafficking in our respective campaigns. 
  [Reporter] You have specifically said that there was no 
money from drug trafficking in your campaign, and that there 
were only two candidates. Do you mean that Ernesto Samper has 
no moral authority to lead the country? 
  [Pastrana] No, no. In my letter to Dr. Samper, I invited 
him to tell the world that if it was confirmed that there were 
funds from drug trafficking in either of our campaigns, that 
candidate would resign from the Colombian presidency because it 
would be an affront to the Republic and the nation. 
  [Reporter] Did you receive a reply to that letter? 
  [Pastrana] No, I have not received a reply, but I hope Dr. 
Samper... 
  [Reporter, interrupting] Do you have proof that drug money 
was used in the electoral campaign? 
  [Pastrana] No, no. I simply said that no such funds were 
used in my campaign, that I could swear before God and my 
conscience that those funds did not exist. I invited Dr. Samper 
to do the same so the world and the media would know that in 
Colombia there is no drug money in our campaigns. 
  [Reporter] Will you participate directly in Samper's 
government? 
  [Pastrana] I have not really thought about that yet. I am 
currently talking with our people. Whether we participate or 
not is not the real issue. My message to Dr. Samper is: We 
will support you in all the good things you do. Whenever we 
think we should criticize and contribute with our ideas, we will 
do so. We are not in favor of the old policy in the sense that 
if we are given a ministry, we will participate in the 
government. If the government does a good job and we believe 
that the results are good, Dr.Samper can be sure we will support 
him. We will also criticize the government when necessary. 
  [Zavarain] Thank you, Dr. Pastrana. 
  [Congote] Ines Maria, before going to more news, I would 
like to ask Dr. Ernesto Samper a question. Good evening, Dr. 
Samper; this is Gloria Congote. In view of Dr. Pastrana's 
proposal and to eliminate any doubts Colombians may have about 
you, would you truly be willing to resign from the presidency 
should it be discovered illegal funds were used in your campaign? 
  [Samper] Gloria, I do not think resignation is the issue. I 
think the doubts expressed by Dr. Pastrana are reckless because 
they compromise, in one way or another, the entire country in 
the eyes of the nation [as heard]. I interpret it as an attempt 
to discredit the electoral results. Over the past few days, I 
have said emphatically that no drug money was used in my 
campaign. 
  As proof I described the ethics code that has guided us from 
the very beginning of the campaign, not just now at the end, as 
Dr. Pastrana suggested, but for the entire year. We implemented 
this code to keep an eye on all funds entering the national 
treasury. I want to invite any reporter or anyone at all who 
wants to review our books to check the origins of all funds. We 
adopted this institutional procedure a year ago to monitor where 
our resources were coming from. 
  [Congote] Dr. Samper, why didn't you answer Dr. Pastrana's 
letter? 
  [Samper] I answered it publicly. I received his letter two 
days after the media received it [chuckles]. I answered it as I 
told you, and I repeat: A year ago, ours was the first campaign 
team to worry about money of doubtful origin or about the 
concentration of resources in the campaign. That is why we 
established these procedures so we can show anyone our books and 
the origins of the funds. 
  [Reporter] Dr. Samper, you said you will govern without 
rancor. Would you include Andres Pastrana in your cabinet? 
  [Samper] I would if the right political conditions are 
present. What are those conditions? The movement headed by Dr. 
Pastrana must decide if it wants to be part of the opposition or 
if it wants to cooperate with the government. If the latter is 
true, we would define the terms for this possible cooperation, 
and as I said before the campaign, I would be pleased to have 
Dr. Andres Pastrana. 
  [Reporter] Dr. Samper, given the very hectic campaign of the 
past three weeks, what will you be doing in the days prior to 
assuming office? 
  [Samper] I will plan the transition process this week. I 
will tell you that we will hold the first transition meeting 
between my campaign team and the government team at 1700 on 21 
June. President Gaviria and I will participate. We will hold 
three transition meetings this week. The government drafted a 
document, which we are already analyzing, on carrying out a 
trouble-free transition. We will continue working. 
  [Zavarain] Dr. Samper, will you accompany the Colombian 
soccer team to upcoming games? 
  [Samper] Yes, I am thinking about accompanying the Colombian 
team to Sunday's game; that is, to the definitive match when 
everything is at stake.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 20 Jun (EFE) -- Andres Pastrana, 
the Conservative Party candidate who lost the Sunday elections 
for the Colombian Presidency to Liberal Party candidate Ernesto 
Samper, announced today that he has no plans to cooperate with 
the new government. 
  Pastrana declared to Radio Cadena Nacional that, in 
principle, his political group, New Democratic Force (NFD), has 
no interest in "bureaucratic quotas" in the new government, 
which Samper will lead from 7 August until the same date in 1998. 
  After tallying up 97 percent of the votes, Ernesto Samper 
garnered 3,679,632 of the 7,353,846 votes cast (50.3 percent), 
and Pastrana garnered 3,553,146 (48.6 percent). 
  "I believe that one must support the good things for the 
nation, but when we have to criticize the new government we will 
do so," Pastrana noted. The conservative leader added that the 
NFD will "be on the watch" with regard to the new government. 
"During the campaign, Samper said he would only work with those 
who supported his candidacy. Therefore, we have not considered 
it because Samper had previously excluded people," Pastrana 
said. 
  Meanwhile, the president-elect stated that Pastrana's 
campaign "will have to make the decision on what its relations 
with the new government will be." Samper said: "Based on that 
statement, I am willing to consider a possible link between my 
government and the sector that Pastrana represents." 
  Pastrana's group held several government posts in the 
administration of outgoing President Cesar Gaviria, among which 
was the Development Ministry, which is responsible for promoting 
economic openness.

<F P=106> [Speech by Humberto de la Calle Lombana, Liberal Party vice </F>
presidential candidate, from the Gonzalo Jimenez de Quesada 
Convention Center in Santa Fe de Bogota -- live] 
  [Text] Mr. Ernesto Samper Pizano, president-elect of 
Colombia; Mrs. Jaquin Samper; Rosalba [De la Calle's wife]; 
Friends; Colombians: I would like to thank all Colombians for 
the clean and democratic victory that Mr. Samper and Mr. De la 
Calle achieved today. It has been a long, hard campaign. At 
times, it even went as far as personal attacks, but we have no 
hard feelings. It is time for generosity and to stand tall. It 
is time for our spirits to be calm so we can conduct our 
administration without discrimination. 
  I also thank Mr. Ernesto Samper. Mr. Samper has been a 
champion of democracy and a generous friend. In offering me the 
opportunity to be his running mate on the presidential ticket, 
he has allowed me to continue to serve Colombia. I admire his 
devotion to social justice. It is a genuine devotion; not 
improvised. I see in Samper the great leader of social justice 
in Colombia. [cheers] It was on this specific issue -- serving 
the poor people of Colombia, men and women of flesh and blood -- 
that we found our greatest affinity in this victorious ticket. 
  I also thank Jaquin for her dedication and assistance I 
would like to reaffirm what I said during the campaign: I am a 
man of the countryside. I am not ashamed to be a man of the 
provinces, and I will continue to be one. I want to make the 
vice presidency the home of the Colombian countryside. What 
Colombia needs is a vice presidency that will reinforce national 
unity by recognizing the diversity of its regions and by 
realizing the potential, the drive, and the creativity of the 
Colombian provinces. [cheers] 
  Our victory, the victory of Ernesto Samper, is also a 
victory 
of the Liberal spirit and of tolerance over fanaticism. It is a 
victory for self-evaluation and pluralism. That is what has 
risen victorious today, my friends. We do not want fanaticism, 
sectarianism, or discrimination in the modern Colombia we have 
envisioned. There will be no room for discrimination on the 
grounds of sex, color, race, creed, or religious belief in the 
Samper administration. [cheers]. 
  As vice president, I also hope to contribute to the 
development of our constitution and the statutory law governing 
the administration of justice. In so doing, we will advance the 
fight against crime, drug trafficking, and drugs in favor of 
true democratic justice for all Colombians. [cheers] The new 
legal instrument for requesting the protection of our 
constitutional rights is the most revolutionary means to truly 
protect our fundamental rights. 
  I believe in reinforcing the resources available in the 
municipalities and departments. This will allow them to fulfill 
their responsibilities, particularly toward social justice. As 
its name suggests, this is a social justice directed at the men 
and women of the masses; the men and women of flesh and blood; 
the men and women of Colombia who have no privileges. 
  We want justice in education and health. We believe the 
first priority for this new government is social investment, the 
search for the vindication of the poor people of Colombia. My 
dear friends, we are behind the poor people of Colombia, not the 
powerful. [crowd cheers] 
  President Cesar Gaviria must be recognized for the 
development of the Constitution. President Gaviria, by 
promoting constitutional changes, transformed Colombia's 
philosophy. In my opinion, what we are looking at now is a more 
modern Colombia with a greater willingness to achieve victory 
and to come out ahead. We want a more optimistic Colombia. 
  As Ernesto Samper has said, I hope to contribute from the 
vice presidency by representing Colombia internationally. We 
are going to fight for human rights, against drug trafficking, 
and for the protection of natural resources and the environment 
of Colombia and the world. 
  Ernesto Samper asked me to help renew the Liberal Party. I 
will never give up trying to accomplish that goal. As president 
of the Liberal Party's Renewal Commission, I hope to conclude 
our mission before 6 August. As of today, I wish to convene a 
Liberal Party convention. We need a more democratic, active, 
and institutional party with a greater committment to the fight 
against corruption. [crowd shouts: Long live the Liberal Party!] 
  I want to tell you that it is a pleasure to have the support 
of millions and millions of Colombians. I am especially 
grateful because I am not a professional politician. I do not 
think I am a man who has turned politics into a profession. I 
come from another field, but my victory today not only commits 
me to Colombia but also teaches me something I heard from Luis 
Carlos Galan, who said if one does not do politics, others will 
do it for you. With Samper we will try to do good politics for 
all Colombians without discrimination, my dear friends. [crowd 
cheers] 
  I conclude by thanking Rosalba and my sons. I want to say 
that without their help and understanding, my dreams of working 
for a more egalitarian society would not have been possible. 
Thank you, thank you my dear friends, and a big hug for 
Colombians. Thank you very much.

  [Text] Yesterday, Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff 
requested Congress study the possibilities of establishing 
external controls on the immense power held by the institution 
he heads. He also asked the legislature to explore mechanisms 
to establish other types of precautionary measures, other than 
imprisonment, to ensure that those under investigation appear 
before prosecutors and judges. 
  The prosecutor general's requests were made yesterday during 
a seminar for criminal prosecutors organized by the Attorney 
General's Office. De Greiff, Attorney General Carlos Gustavo 
Arrieta, Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez, and Deputy Prosecutor 
General Francisco Sintura attended the seminar. 
  Regarding the first request, the prosecutor general said 
legislators had not established controls on "the great amount of 
power given to prosecutors and that it is necessary to establish 
controls for the future." 
  De Greiff said there is a 2d Court of Appeals at the 
Prosecutor General's Office, but this in itself is a 
contradiction because those who file suit in the 1st and 2d 
Courts of Appeals are delegates of the prosecutor general and 
belong to a body that has a unified administration, hierarchy, 
and follows general administrative procedures and criminal 
guidelines established by the prosecutor general of the 
Republic. "We respect this 2d Court of Appeals, because we do 
not attempt to have absolute power but, rather, one sole 
criminal policy, not many policies as in the past," the 
prosecutor general said. 
  Regarding precautionary measures, he said "arrest warrants 
must be issued as an exception and when we do not have a 
guarantee the person under investigation will present himself to 
the authorities. It is more appropriate to promote legislative 
reforms that will allow us other types of precautionary 
measures, such as bail," de Greiff said. 
  He admitted there are prosecutors who are quick to issue 
precautionary measures and involve people in cases. "Certain 
prosecutors are frequently quick to issue precautionary 
measures, and we have noticed people are precipitately involved 
many times in cases under investigation, as can be seen at 
inquiries when the prosecutor does not have all the necessary 
facts to ask questions," de Greiff added. 
  The prosecutor general also said the institutions can no 
longer allow validation of the assertion: "Nobody is refused an 
arrest warrant in Colombia." "This sentence is shocking and has 
been in effect since the time when there were criminal 
investigation judges." 
  The prosecutor general stated his position regarding a 
possible increase of jail sentences for several crimes and said 
increasing the penalties to the maximum is not the solution. 
The important thing is, he said, to have a penitentiary system 
that guarantees the rehabilitation of the criminal. "We gain 
nothing by putting all the hoods in jail if we do not have a 
penitentiary system that will give them a chance to 
rehabilitate," de Greiff said. 
<H5>  Arrest Warrants </H5>
  "Several people say the best system is the one in the United 
States, where drug traffickers are given long sentences or life. 
Let me tell you this is not true. Those penalties are imposed 
on Colombian drug traffickers, not U.S. drug traffickers. I do 
not know of a single case where a U.S. drug trafficker has been 
sentenced to life." 
  For his part, Arrieta said the Attorney General's Office 
should be committed to completing its investigations, that its 
role should expand and include the assurance that due process is 
complied with to safeguard respect for human rights, and that 
the law is interpreted and implemented correctly. "The main 
goal is to advance from formulating measures to restricting 
personal freedom to the point where such measures are only used 
when necessary to guarantee the appearance of those accused at 
court," the attorney general said. 
  According to Arrieta, personnel of the Attorney General's 
Office must be vigilant in stopping certain prosecutors' abuses 
of issuing preventive arrest warrants. "We must adapt Colombian 
criminal law to international laws that recommend freedom as a 
basic principle during the investigative phase and thus leave 
jails for those who are serving imposed sentences." 
  For his part, the justice minister said the current Criminal 
Procedures Code had improved the trial system because, according 
to him, it was an important instrument in inhibiting impunity, 
clearing the backlog in legal offices, and avoiding expiration 
of investigations. 
<H5>  No contacts with the Cali Cartel </H5>
  Yesterday, De Greiff and Arrieta said they have had no 
contacts with lawyers of important Cali Cartel members for 
several months. According to de Greiff, the Prosecutor General's 
Office is waiting for the Valle drug traffickers to understand 
that the best alternative is to surrender to justice and that 
his office is willing to further this process. Arrieta said 
"the Cali Cartel lawyers are most surely waiting for the change 
in government to reinitiate their advances." 
  The prosecutor general and the attorney general commented on 
other current national events: 
  The Hidden Microphones in Samper's Campaign: The prosecutor 
general said it is being investigated, "but it will be difficult 
to find the culprits in this crime due to a lack of evidence. 
We will investigate as much as possible." 
  Retirement Age: The prosecutor said he is waiting for the 
Supreme Court to define if he is an official with an established 
term or if he must retire when he is 65 years of age. 
  Church and Politics: The attorney general said the call made 
by several bishops for their parishioners to vote for one of the 
candidates is unjustified. "I believe Monsignor Castrillon's 
call was a personal one and did not include the church as a 
whole. Church interference in politics is something we have 
already surpassed. It does not have any justification at this 
time." 
  Disaster Attention Office: The attorney general said the 
Attorney General's Office will investigate as soon as the 
emergency subsides whether the officials in that government 
office had been negligent. "What is important now is attending 
to the victims. We will start to investigate once this phase is 
over. It would be senseless to do so now."

    [Editorial Report] On 24 May, the Attorney General's Office 
and the Colombian Banking Association (Asobancaria) concluded an 
agreement intended to strengthen the government's hand in 
detecting and fighting official corruption. The agreement will 
facilitate the examination of bank records by authorities 
looking for evidence of money obtained through illegal means. 
Specifically, the agreement provides for a smoother exchange of 
banking information between the Office of Special Investigations 
(OIE) -- the department of the Attorney General's Office 
responsible for much of the preliminary investigative work in 
cases of administrative corruption -- and Asobancaria, and will 
improve the latter's technical support to the OIE. (EL TIEMPO 25 
May; EL ESPECTADOR 26 May) President Cesar Gaviria, who 
attended the signing ceremony at the presidential palace, 
hailed the agreement as an "extremely important step forward" in 
coordinating efforts by the state and civil society to fight 
administrative corruption. He added that the accord is part of a 
larger strategy to prevent use of the country's financial system 
"to conceal investments or make use of resources obtained by 
means of illicit activities." Attorney General Carlos Gustavo 
Arrieta described the agreement as "a veritable revolution" in 
the struggle to fight illicit enrichment, and said it would 
"greatly reduce" investigation time. (EL TIEMPO 25 May) 
  Although financial institutions were already required to 
provide the Attorney General's Office with information upon 
request, the process whereby OIE investigators collected the 
data was time-consuming, subject to leaks, and did not always 
receive the full cooperation of bank officials, according to EL 
ESPECTADOR (26 May). By greatly streamlining procedures for 
gathering information and relaying it to the appropriate 
authorities, the new agreement could reduce OIE investigative 
work by as much as 75 percent, according to EL TIEMPO (25 May). 
  In a commentary in EL ESPECTADOR (29 May), Arrieta explained 
that the agreement eliminates the need for investigators to go 
from bank to bank, including individual branch offices, 
throughout the country searching for a suspect's accounts as 
well as those of family members or others which may have been 
used to conceal the illicit activity. Now, an investigator can 
simply report a suspect's name to Asobancaria's Center for 
Financial Sector Information (Cifin), which will be required 
quickly to provide all relevant information from its data bank 
of current information on accounts and transactions made at the 
country's financial institutions. (EL ESPECTADOR 29 May; EL 
TIEMPO 25 May) 
  In addition, the new procedures will help to ensure the 
confidentiality of investigations. Arrieta notes that, under the 
previous system, numerous bank officials were involved in 
responding to an OIE inquiry, increasing the risk that a suspect 
would be alerted to the investigation. Under the new system, 
however, each institution will appoint a representative to the 
Cifin working group who will be responsible for handling all 
requests for information from that institution. (EL TIEMPO 25 
May) 
  Addressing reports that bank officials had sometimes failed 
to cooperate fully with OIE investigators in the past, Arrieta 
said that in signing the agreement the financial system has 
"given its full commitment to the fight against corruption." (EL 
TIEMPO 25 May) 
  The agreement also calls for Asobancaria to provide 
investigators with training and ongoing assistance in 
understanding the more technical details of banking operations. 
Arrieta noted that such cooperation is especially important 
because criminals have refined their methods of concealing the 
illegal origin of their money. (EL ESPECTADOR 29 May) 
  Asobancaria and the Prosecutor General's Office are 
reportedly working out a similar agreement. (EL ESPECTADOR 26 
May)

<F P=106> [Interview with Fidel Castano; place and date not given; </F>
first paragraph is SEMANA introduction] 
  [Text] A few days ago, through the intercession of the 
attorney who is representing Fidel Castano before the Prosecutor 
General's Office, SEMANA was able to interview the paramilitary 
commander, who is one of the country's most wanted men. Having 
secured responses to the initial questionnaire and then to some 
additional questions, SEMANA's editorial board decided to 
publish them since Castano offers many revelations about some of 
the biggest crimes in recent years. 
  [SEMANA] Your hatred for the guerrillas reportedly stems 
from 
the murder of your father, whom the subversives executed after 
kidnapping him and after you paid a ransom. How did that story 
go? 
  [Castano] My father was kidnapped in 1981 from an estate he 
owned in the municipality of Segovia (Antioquia) by the Fourth 
Front of the FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia], 
which demanded 100 million pesos for his release. It was 
impossible to raise that amount of money at the time, inasmuch 
as our total wealth was not even half that much. Nevertheless, 
with the help of several local ranchers and a loan that the 
Amalfi Agricultural Credit Bank gave us under the Estate Law, we 
got together 30 million pesos and paid them. They then told me 
that 70 million was missing. I told them that I did not have 
that kind of money and that if I ever did, I would use it for 
nothing else but to combat them. My defiant reply was the reason 
they killed him. 
  [SEMANA] Did you start forming the paramilitary groups in 
Cordova after this episode? 
  [Castano] The group was actually created many years later. 
What I did right after my father's murder was to offer myself as 
a volunteer guide to the army, specifically to the Bombona 
Battalion in Puerto Berrio and the military base of the same 
battalion in Segovia. For two years, thanks to my help, as I 
told them the location of guerrilla camps and pointed out 
members of the FARC and the ELN [National Liberation Army], that 
battalion achieved excellent results in its operations. 
Concurrently, I received counterinsurgency training. 
  After that I began to realize that the methods that the army 
was using could counter the actions of the guerrilla groups but 
never exterminate them. So I decided to create my own group and 
began operating in northeastern Antioquia, the Middle Magdalena, 
as far as the department of Cordova. 
  [SEMANA] What was the purpose of these groups? Who financed 
them and how? 
  [Castano] At first the groups were small, just a few 
peasants 
who were being harmed by the guerrillas and who saw self-defense 
as a way of defending their lands from the abuses and atrocities 
committed against them and their families. In other words, we 
began our activities as self-defense and we later learned that 
the guerrillas had neither the courage nor the military and 
logistic capacity that was being attributed to them, inasmuch as 
they always avoided a direct confrontation with our people. It 
was really then that we started to deploy our forces and went on 
the offensive to cover other areas and, at the same time, mold 
our deployment to the guerrillas' area of influence. 
  [SEMANA] But who financed them? 
  [Castano] As for their financing, the self-defense groups 
have always been financed by the people who have economic 
interests in the zones in which these groups operate. 
  [SEMANA] These paramilitary groups reportedly sowed terror 
in 
Cordova, and the authorities point to you and these groups as 
the perpetrators of the massacres in Las Tangas, La Negra, and 
Punta Coquitos. The Supreme Court recently upheld a 20-year 
sentence against you in connection with these incidents. What 
actually happened? 
  [Castano] I must regrettably acknowledge that any armed 
group 
in an area of conflict of one sort or another terrifies the 
civilian population. Now then, the Supreme Court upheld a 
20-year sentence against me, but not for those massacres. On the 
contrary, I was acquitted in connection with them. I was 
convicted of conspiracy to commit a crime because I publicly 
admitted having had a self-defense group at the time of the 
demobilization, and we surrendered our weapons to the government. 
  What really happened was that back then there were various 
independent, uncontrolled self-defense groups, but the public 
seemed to think there was only one, mine, which they blamed for 
everything that happened in that region of the country. 
  [SEMANA] What did you achieve with the paramilitary groups 
in 
Cordova? 
  [Castano] During the time that my self-defense groups were 
in 
the Upper Sinu, there were no kidnappings by the guerrillas; 
land values rose; the ranchers were not paying protection money, 
and all of the cattlemen could calmly visit their ranches. In 
other words, the guerrillas were eradicated. 
  [SEMANA] You are said to be a man of the world who travels 
constantly and is a major art connoisseur. Is this true? 
  [Castano] I lived for three years in Paris, where I was in 
the artworks business. Before that, when circumstances allowed, 
I traveled through several countries like any other person who 
can afford to and has some taste. I do not have as much money as 
my friends have always thought; I consider myself an average 
person, a hard worker who struggles through life and is immersed 
in countless problems. But I am content and I am still alive. 
  [SEMANA] Let's move on to another subject. Did you ever work 
with Escobar? How did you meet him? How was your relationship 
with him at the outset? Did you two ever do business? 
  [Castano] I met Pablo Escobar in the late 1970's in 
Medellin; 
at the time I bought and sold cars on commission. I met him when 
I sold him several trucks, and we remained friends. We had 
certain things in common, and although it may seem odd, we had 
enormous sympathy for leftist ideology, so much so that on one 
occasion we tried to contact one of the guerrilla groups that 
existed at the time. But those leanings disappeared in him later 
when he started making a lot of money and in me when that 
guerrilla group kidnapped and later killed my father. It is 
incomprehensible to me that my eternal enemies once had my 
support. There are times when I think that if I had not had 
reason to become a counterinsurgent, I would have been a 
guerrilla. 
  I have to admit that I held Pablo in esteem back then, but 
not as greatly as I came to despise him because I never imagined 
that one day, in his obsession with money and power, he would 
become the most despicable and bloodthirsty man ever born in 
Colombia. 
  [SEMANA] The authorities have fingered you as one of the 
chiefs of the military wing of the Medellin Cartel. Is this true? 
  [Castano] I have never worked for anyone, and much less have 
I had bosses. I have not been a mercenary either. I have been 
independent and I take responsibility for my actions. 
  [SEMANA] Because of that link to Escobar you have been cited 
as one of the masterminds behind the blowing up of the Avianca 
jet. The Prosecutor General's Office linked you and Escobar to 
that case and recently ordered your arrest. Were you involved in 
that bombing? 
  [Castano] My war has been only with everything that smacks 
to 
me of the guerrillas. I do not blow up planes. I do not need to 
blow up a plane to kill someone famous. That reflects a lack of 
military resources. When you go into battle convinced that you 
are in the right and are acting with justice, you do not need to 
kill 107 people to achieve a goal. 
  [SEMANA] What arguments do you have to counter the charges 
that the Prosecutor General's Office has leveled at you? Do you 
have information about the person or persons who ordered the 
bombing, who carried it out, and what their reasons were to kill 
107 passengers? 
  [Castano] It is a secret to no one that Pablo Escobar was 
the 
mastermind of that awful bombing. He was the only one who could 
have thought of such an insane terrorist act. As for who carried 
it out, his deputies who are now fortunately behind bars in La 
Picota Prison in Bogota can answer that. 
  [SEMANA] Another of the crimes that the Prosecutor's Office 
has linked you to is the assassination of the former candidate 
of Patriotic Union, Bernardo Jaramillo Ossa. Last February an 
arrest warrant was issued for you, and your two brothers, 
Vicente and Carlos Castano, were also linked to the case. 
  [Castano] I had a role in that, but I was not the 
mastermind, 
much less the perpetrator. My brothers Carlos and Vicente had 
absoluetly nothing to do with the incident or with any of my 
activities outside the law. If I had been involved in any way in 
any other activity, I would also say so, because my goal is to 
have everyone pay for what he has done. 
  [SEMANA] You say that you did not kill Jaramillo. So who is 
to blame for his murder? 
  [Castano] It was ordered by Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, alias 
"El Mexicano," and directed by Ariel Otero and men working for 
Jaime Eduardo Rueda Rocha. 
  [SEMANA] But how were you involved? 
  [Castano] At a meeting that "El Mexicano" organized I was 
asked for my opinion, and I agreed with the order that he had 
given to execute the operation, the details of which I did not 
know. 
  [SEMANA] The courts also link you to the assassinations of 
Senator Alfonso Ospina Ospina and Father Sergio Restrepo. 
  [Castano] As for the murder of Father Sergio Restrepo, I can 
tell you that I have never had confrontations with the Church or 
with any of its members, and if there is anything that I am 
going to fight for, it is to show that I was not aware of 
anything that happened during the time that Dr. Alfonso Ospina 
was being held prisoner. I lent armed personnel to retired Army 
Captain Elkin Henao for some operations in the Middle Magdalena, 
and he used them behind my back to look after Dr. Alfonso Ospina 
during his captivity, all this in association with Pablo 
Escobar. I am absolutely certain that the Prosecutor's Office 
will acquit me of these charges. Why should I deny this, given 
the police record I have? 
  [SEMANA] What were the causes of your breakup with Escobar 
and more or less when did it happen? 
  [Castano] About 15 months before he was imprisoned in La 
Catedral, Pablo gave the ELN a lot of weapons, and this upset me 
greatly. We even had a bitter argument, and I never spoke to him 
again. I felt like going after him, but the truth is that he 
scared me. During the time that he was in La Catedral, in fact, 
the Moncadas and Fernando Galeano were murdered, and those of us 
who stayed alive felt obliged to fight against him because we 
had no other choice. 
  [SEMANA] Were you the founder of "Los Pepes"? 
  [Castano] On 21 February 1994 I sent the prosecutor general 
of the nation a memo saying: "I would like to clarify to you, 
Mr. Prosecutor General of the Nation, that in order to combat 
the despicable Pablo Escobar and his Medellin Cartel and to 
prevent them from continuing to attack the Colombian people and 
us, whom he persecuted tirelessly, I was the founder of the 
group that called itself `Los Pepes' and, at the same time, its 
military chief. In this and in my other activities outside the 
law, my brothers were not at all involved, as my enemies would 
have people believe." 
  [SEMANA] Why were "Los Pepes" established? 
  [Castano] It is my understanding that "Los Pepes" were not 
established. One day, 30 million Colombians persecuted by Pablo 
Escobar simply got fed up and banded together against him as 
society's response to the absolute power acquired by Escobar and 
his deputies, whom the State has now either killed or put behind 
bars. The city of Medellin was in the hands of a bunch of 
criminals, not common criminals but insane ones who killed and 
kidnapped innocent people like never before. So, there had to be 
a strong reaction, fighting fire with fire, or else we were 
lost. I think that Medellin and the entire country are breathing 
easier now that this thousand-headed monster and his famous 
cartel are gone. 
  [SEMANA] How were they organized? 
  [Castano] Everybody soon realized that the prison called La 
Catedral, where Pablo Escobar and his people were being held, 
had become a bunker in which murders were being committed and 
from which orders were given to kidnap, kill, and blackmail 
industrialists, businessmen, ranchers, and affluent people. 
Several distinguished persons sought me out and asked me to head 
up a self-defense group against Pablo Escobar. I thought up the 
name "Those persecuted by Pablo Escobar." 
  [SEMANA] How did "Los Pepes" operate? 
  [Castano] "Los Pepes" operated on two fronts. The first, 
called intelligence, was in charge of gathering all sorts of 
information on the structure of Pablo's organization. After the 
information had been gathered, it was conveyed by telephone or 
other channels to the appropriate authorities so that they could 
take advantage of it. The other front was called the action 
front; it was an armed group that I personally headed and that 
acted on the information to neutralize and destroy the enemy. 
  [SEMANA] How was the group financed? 
  [Castano] There was no problem with that. Industrialists, 
politicians, and cattlemen contributed money. We also raised 
money and earmarked it for this cause. 
  [SEMANA] Who else was part of the top brass in "Los Pepes"? 
  [Castano] That is for the Prosecutor's Office to find out. I 
cannot be disloyal on this point. 
  [SEMANA] "Los Pepes" claimed responsibility for a number of 
attacks, including the murder of Omar Canas, who played for the 
Atletico Nacional soccer team, and announced that other members 
of the team would meet the same fate. Why? 
  [Castano] I am not going to be the one who tarnishes the 
image of players on that team. We have all made mistakes in 
life, and anyway they are all adults. 
  [SEMANA] Why did you set fire to Pablo Escobar's homes, blow 
up his properties, and destroy his collection of automobiles? 
  [Castano] At some point someone had to battle Pablo by using 
his own methods. Pablo planted bombs, kidnapped, and then 
murdered his friends, but not before taking away all their money 
and property. He tortured and killed hundreds of people. So we 
were not going to combat someone as insane as him by dropping 
hints. The people wanted us to destroy Pablo without resorting 
to violence, but that was not possible. If things had been done 
that way, today all of us and the government itself would once 
again be on our knees at the feet of that monster. 
  [SEMANA] Why did you kill Guido Parra? 
  [Castano] The Guido Parra affair was indeed a regrettable 
mistake. The operation was a hasty one. One sector of the 
organization did not handle the matter with the proper 
restraint. Unfortunately, I was away, though I am not trying to 
dodge my responsibility by saying this. But, excesses are 
committed in war too. You have to understand, though, that this 
was not done gratuitously. The operational command of "Los 
Pepes" received information that Guido Parra was in direct 
contact with Pablo Escobar and that he served as his liaison for 
intelligence work and as an adviser on hide-outs and other 
operations. We know today that Pablo Escobar himself misinformed 
us and also that Dr. Guido Parra was no longer even his lawyer 
and that they had their differences because Escobar owed him a 
lot of money in fees. So, we were victims of Escobar's ploy to 
make us look like common murderers of innocent people. This was 
another of his wartime strategies. 
  [SEMANA] Why did you kill other attorneys for Escobar and 
his 
organization, like Salomon Lozano and Raul Zapata? 
  [Castano] In the case of Salomon Lozano, the legal adviser 
to 
Carlos Mario Urquijo, alias "Arete," we found that he was no 
longer his defense attorney. Instead, he served him as a 
courier, carrying letters with false accusations and conveying 
Pablo Escobar's instructions to attack "Los Pepes" in a bid to 
wage what they called "the legal war," so that they could use 
the military, in other words, government security forces, 
against me and the organization. 
  The same was the case with Raul Zapata. In short, these 
individuals strayed beyond the bounds of their profession and 
became common criminals in service to the people who were behind 
bars, not to solve their problems but to misinform. 
  [SEMANA] How did you collaborate with the Search Bloc in 
harassing Pablo Escobar? 
  [Castano] We never had direct contact with the Search Bloc. 
We gave it a lot of information through various channels that 
did not identify us. 
  [SEMANA] Is it true that you were involved in the operation 
in which Escobar died? In what other operations did you take 
part? 
  [Castano] No. I repeat: we never had any joint operations 
with the Search Bloc. The operation in which Escobar died was 
conducted exclusively by the police, as is public knowledge. 
  [SEMANA] What happened to "Los Pepes" after Escobar's death? 
Did they demobilize? 
  [Castano] After Escobar's death there was no reason for our 
organization to continue. Since that glorious 2 December no more 
people are being persecuted by Pablo Escobar in Colombia. 
  [SEMANA] Intelligence agencies report that after Escobar's 
death you had contacts with his family. Did you sign some sort 
of truce with his relatives? What are its terms? 
  [Castano] I spoke with Hermilda and told her that we had 
absolutely nothing against them, and I said the same thing to 
Maria Victoria in a letter. We never regarded Pablo's family or 
the families of the other cartel members as enemies. 
  [SEMANA] You demanded that Escobar's deputies who are in 
maximum-security prisons confess to all their crimes. Was there 
some sort of pact? 
  [Castano] I do not consider it a pact. I simply thought that 
the members of the cartel were making a mockery of the 
Prosecutor's Office. They turned themselves in and confessed to 
a minor crime, thus eluding us and hoping to go free in one 
year. At that point we demanded that each and every one of them 
confess to all their crimes, which would guarantee them at least 
10 years in prison. That way we would not have to go after them 
again, because the Prosecutor's Office would finally be 
punishing them for their crimes. 
  [SEMANA] What happened to the Medellin Cartel after 
Escobar's 
death? Did you take over as its leader? 
  [Castano] Drug trafficking has never attracted me. My 
businesses have always revolved around ranching and art. How am 
I supposed to head up a cartel that no longer exists? How am I 
supposed to spearhead a cause that was involved in drug 
trafficking, with which I have never agreed? I must admit that I 
was a friend of drug traffickers, but only because of my 
financial dealings. The Medellin Cartel died with Pablo Escobar. 
So, there is nothing to head up in Medellin. The only thing I 
want in my future is to live in the countryside, thus assuring 
the government that I, Fidel Castano, will never again break the 
peace in Colombia. 
  [SEMANA] What is your relationship with the Cali Cartel? 
Escobar always said that the Cali people and you were the heads 
of "Los Pepes." How was Cali involved in that organization? 
  [Castano] I have no relationship with what you call the Cali 
Cartel. I do not think that the cartel exists as such. I do have 
good friends in the Cauca Valley and I am grateful to them 
because they were the ones who provided the authorities with the 
most information about Pablo Escobar's narcoterrorists. 
  [SEMANA] Have you thought about turning yourself in to the 
authorities? 
  [Castano] I have thought about it repeatedly. But the 
outlook 
would be bleak for me because I know that it would take longer 
to get me into prison than to get myself killed there. I have a 
lot of enemies in jail, and they would not waste this unique 
opportunity to murder me. I think that all things considered, I 
will try to stay alive in the countryside. I would rather die 
there than give my enemies a chance to achieve their goal. So, I 
have promised myself that I will never allow myself to be taken 
to jail. I swear it. 
  [SEMANA] Is your paramilitary group still active? 
  [Castano] No, I do not have a paramilitary group, but I do 
have armed personnel to protect me, because I still live in a 
mountainous area alongside the FARC, the ELN, and a hard core of 
cattle rustlers from the Popular Liberation Army who dream of 
seeing me dead. When all is said and done, as long as I am 
living in a guerrilla zone, I will never be able to let down my 
guard.

<F P=106> ["Political Affairs Column" by Dora Kramer: "Franco's Group </F>
Withdraws From PSDB Campaign"] 
  [Text] The much-ballyhooed incorporation last week of 
Telerj [Rio de Janeiro Telephone Company] President Jose de 
Castro into Fernando Henrique Cardoso's campaign was canceled on 
Friday [10 June]. Civilian Household Minister Henrique 
Hargreaves has also decided to maintain a prudent distance. 
Hargreaves, Castro, and Itamar Franco are disheartened by the 
campaign committee. On 9 June the president complained to 
Cardoso over the phone. This happened just as Vox Populi polls 
are showing that government support is helping the PSDB 
[Brazilian Social Democracy Party] candidacy. 
  The palace group is upset over the treatment it has received 
from some members of the Brasilia electoral committee and feels 
its efforts to curb the wave of dissatisfaction have not been 
duly recognized. Hargreaves said: "I am a minister of the 
Itamar Franco government, and I am not campaigning for anyone, 
although I may consider Cardoso the best candidate and will help 
him individually, but not as member of the government." Over 
the past few weeks Hargreaves has traveled around Brazil. He 
has confessed that those trips have worn him out. 
  He went to Bahia, Sao Paulo, and Para in an effort to 
politically adjust some tremors which were beginning to 
undermine the foundations of the alliance, namely the PFL 
[Liberal Front Party]. Hargreaves has also been trying to stop 
the exodus of a group of PFL senators who, as holders of a large 
number of votes, consider inadmissible the way they are being 
treated by the top PSDB leadership. 
  These senators feel neglected, overlooked, and rejected; not 
just from the campaign but from the central decisions as well. 
Many are considering giving up Cardoso's campaign, especially 
because they feel better treated by the entourage surrounding 
Leonel Brizola or Orestes Quercia than by the PSDB group. Over 
the past few days Hargreaves has been seeking appeasement. So 
far no one knows if he was successful or not. Last Friday Jose 
de Castro was getting ready for a similar task. 
  Over the weekend, however, a private conversation was held 
at 
Planalto Palace among these and other personalities who 
reassessed the implicit inclusion into the campaign of some 
top-level people. They decided it would not be prudent, 
especially because they interpreted some signs they did not 
like. They felt within the already organized command there is 
the impression the new group could cause the loss of authority, 
changes in direction, and changes in the established goals. 
  Although Pimenta da Veiga, Cardoso's political coordinator, 
has repeated lately that he does not dispute the "monopoly of 
victory" and will respect any suggestion, the palace group and 
former Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes [ACM] do not 
fully believe it. Thus, they decided to remain, but at a 
distance. ACM clearly told Hargreaves: "I have many votes to 
contribute. What I do not have is the youth to fight for a 
post, command, or power in the electoral campaign." 
  Hargreaves and Jose de Castro share the same idea. They will 
continue to work for Cardoso, mainly because he is the candidate 
preferred by them and by Franco, but they do not want any 
further intimacy with the campaign central committee. They feel 
the committee lacks the humility to recognize who controls the 
largest share of votes (the PFL), while there is too much 
self-sufficiency. 
  Officially, however, the Planalto Palace will not give any 
explicit explanation for the withdrawal of its troops. It will 
not give, if there is no demand, any explanation. Nevertheless, 
the ministers are still working on the campaign and the 
government is working hard for its candidate. 
  If anyone is really interested in learning the reason for 
the 
absence of the palace group from the daily activity of those who 
seek to elect Fernando Henrique Cardoso, quick answers are 
available. Jose de Castro will say problems within Telebras 
[Brazilian Telecommunications, Inc.] keep him busy at the Telerj 
presidency, while Hargreaves will argue that he never worked for 
any committee. He will remain where he has always been, 
discreetly, at the Civilian Household. 
  Cardoso is aware of the uneasiness. He did as he did with 
Franco last week; he phoned as soon as he learned that the 
president was upset because the candidate was not looking for 
him, was not asking for political counsels, and was no longer 
visiting the Planalto Palace. It is quite possible that this 
week he will contact the palace-committee circle to calm down 
the most excited spirits. If he does not do so, serious rifts 
may be expected very soon.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A State of Risk"] </F>
  [Text] As the second-largest contributor to the Brazilian 
GDP, the priority of Rio de Janeiro State is to guarantee the 
production of electrical power through a reliable and consistent 
network as an essential condition for maintaining and expanding 
its industrial and agricultural sectors. The economic future of 
the state depends on a political decision, one that can lead to 
the creation of thousands of direct and indirect jobs, increase 
tax revenues, and attract new investments. 
  It is unfair that this state, which accounts for more than 
60 
percent of all the oil produced by Brazil, is forbidden by the 
Constitution from collecting a single cent of the ICMS [Goods 
and Services Distribution Tax] on operations to supply other 
states (this means Sao Paulo) with petroleum and 
petroleum-derived lubricants, liquid fuel, and gas. On the 
other hand, Sao Paulo is authorized to collect the ICMS on its 
industrial and agricultural products that are sold to other 
states. Sao Paulo State also collects ICMS on gas from the 
Campos Basin supplied through Comgas [Municipal Gas Company]. 
  This represents a risk for Rio de Janeiro, which in 1990 
consumed 25,138 kwh, only which just 8,267 kwh came from its own 
sources. The fact that 50 percent of the electric power consumed 
by the state is produced outside its territory explains why we 
have been begging in vain for large industries to settle in Rio 
de Janeiro. 
  The lag between electric power production and consumption 
has 
made Rio de Janeiro extremely sensitive to decisions on 
investments in the electric power sector outside its own 
territory. The state is also vulnerable to operational 
contingencies in the electricity power grid. A break in the 
transmission lines from Itaipu [hydroelectric complex] can black 
out Rio de Janeiro, paralyzing its industries. This is how we 
arrived in a state of risk. 
  This situation arose following systematic operational 
difficulties in one of Itaipu's transmission networks. The 
problem has not caused further damage only because of the 
remarkable drop in electrical power consumption following the 
economic crisis that began 12 years ago. It should be noted 
that the Angra-1 nuclear power station has also contributed [to 
place Rio de Janeiro on a state of risk], given that it accounts 
for 36 percent of the electric power generated in Rio de Janeiro. 
  This merely emphasizes the decisive importance of expanding 
the use of nuclear energy as a power generation source in order 
to reduce the current dependence. Nuclear energy is essential 
for Rio de Janeiro: The vast majority of the Brazilian 
institutions that are linked to nuclear energy, not just in the 
industrial area but also those linked with training courses and 
professional associations, are located in this state. 
  The concentration of these activities in Rio de Janeiro 
State 
makes it a real nuclear center that comprises the following 
institutions: 
  1. The National Nuclear Energy Commission (CNEN), which 
controls and grants licenses to nuclear units and which 
coordinates nuclear technological research; 2. The Nuclear 
Energy and Radio Protection and Dosimetry Institutes [Institutos 
de Energia Nuclear e de Radioprotecao e Dosimetria]; 3. Nuclear 
Industries of Brazil, which is a holding [preceding word in 
English] of industries connected with the nuclear fuel cycle; 4. 
Furnas Electric Power Plants, Inc., which owns the Angra-1, 2, 
and 3 power plants (3 is still under construction); 5. The Fuel 
Elements Factory, the Separation Elements Plant, and the 
Isotopic Enrichment Plant in Resende. 
  We must not overlook Nuclen [Nuclebras Engineering, Inc.], a 
nuclear plant engineering company; Nuclep [Nuclebras Heavy 
Equipment, Inc.], which produces equipment for the primary 
circuit of these nuclear plants; Monazite Sands Primary 
Beneficiation Plant [Usina de Beneficiamento primario de areias 
monaziticas] in Campos; or the Brazilian Nuclear Quality 
Institute. These are research and training institutions which 
provide valuable technological assistance. 
  We must insist: Once the Angra plants are totally 
operational 
they will considerably increase the power base of the 
Southeastern power grid. The Angra plants, which are located 
near the main consumer markets of the country (130 km from Rio, 
220 km from Sao Paulo, and 350 km from Belo Horizonte) will 
reinforce the whole power system and guarantee a suitable power 
supply for the states of Rio de Janeiro and Espirito Santo. 
  The assembly of Angra-2 is currently a top priority. It is 
at an advanced stage (67 percent built) and is being financed by 
Germany and by Furnas. Energy demand projections show an 
average 5 percent increase of consumption per year for the 
South/Southeast/Center-West grid. So there is no time to waste. 
  The commissioning of Angra-2 will reduce Rio de Janeiro's 
dependency on energy from other states from the current 50 
percent to 35 percent. Angra-2 will provide 350 civil 
construction jobs and 550 engineering jobs for 4 years; 350 
administrative jobs for 5 years; and will create 1,400 new 
electro-mechanical assembly jobs for 5 years. 
  Over the next 5 years, the related taxes collected will 
represent $100 million for the state and for the municipalities. 
This is apart from the improved social benefits for the region 
in the field of education, health, and infrastructure. 
  The consolidation of a nuclear center will allow Brazil 
access to the international nuclear market, which handles 
billions of dollars per year in the supply of fuel elements, the 
manufacture of equipment, the training of operators, and the 
supply of engineering and quality control services. 
  Then why this reluctance to assemble Angra-2? To compare it 
with Angra-1 is like comparing a Jumbo jet and an Electra. It 
follows the security concept of the German nuclear plants, the 
safest and with best performance in the world. In terms of 
transfer of technology the Angra-2 has been very successful: 108 
of the 113 systems of the plant were designed by Nuclen. 
  The reasons for postponing its construction based on the 
long 
economic recession have already been overcome. Environmental 
excuses do not hold water. The arguments used by organizations 
like Greenpeace can be summarized in three categories: 1. 
Nuclear energy is expensive and dangerous and it is declining in 
the rest of the world; 2. Nuclear plants are the fastest way to 
obtain a nuclear bomb; 3. Nuclear power involves technology that 
externally serves the interests of German industrial 
penetration, and internally consolidates a military class that 
longs to make Brazil a world power. 
  The first lie is based on a superstition similar to that 
felt 
by those who fear flying. There is no point in proving to them 
that statistically more people die in traffic accidents (or of 
heart attacks) than in airplane accidents. There is no point in 
proving that the environmental damage caused by conventional 
power plants is greater than that caused by nuclear plants. The 
problem is not caused by modern nuclear plants but by backyard 
accidents like the one that took place in Goiania when medical 
equipment was scrapped [and a radioactive cesium capsule was 
stolen]. 
  Hysterical tropical NGO's [Non Government Organizations] 
merely cover their ears to these arguments. They are totally 
controlled by reactionaries who swallowed the extreme concept of 
[18th century philosopher Jean Jacques] Rousseau of comparing 
the good savage with the [Brazilian] lion-monkey [mico-leao]. 
They do not take into consideration the fact that Chernobyl was 
a fifth-rate nuclear plant that did not meet minimum Western 
standards or that the accident in Three Mile Island was confined 
to the interior of the plant and did not harm the environment. 
They do not want to hear about sea platforms like Pampo, for 
example, which produces hydrogen sulfide gas and which is a 
volcano with a statistically greater chance of erupting than 
Angra-1. They selectively choose to ignore Petrobras [Brazilian 
Petroleum Corporation] and the tropical forest devastation 
because the NGO headquarters abroad know the Brazilian people 
are proud of their oil and are concerned about the Amazon 
region. They know that a phobia of nuclear plants gives them 
more notoriety. 
  It is a lie that nuclear energy is declining in the rest of 
the world: Despite the 1970 world recession, when nuclear energy 
represented 1.6 percent of the world energy capacity, by 1990 it 
had risen to 17 percent, which is very close to hydroelectric 
energy, which represents 19 percent of the total world energy 
capacity. In France, 78 percent of the domestic power 
production comes from nuclear energy. There even are nuclear 
power plants located around Paris. Nuclear power plants in 
Belgium produce 59.9 percent of all requirements. 
  The United States, France, Japan, the former USSR, Canada, 
and the old GDR produce 60 percent of all the nuclear power 
energy in the world. It is not surprising that these 
environmentalist groups, which favor the "zero growth" preached 
by the old Rome Club, come from the very countries that do not 
want to transfer modern energy and technology to other countries. 
  It is known that the Carter administration did everything it 
could to stop Germany from transferring technology that should 
have remained in the First World. Former [Science and 
Technology] Minister Renato Archer has revealed that British 
Professor John Demos, who directs a nuclear power plant, told 
him the Americans do not want the largest energy industry in the 
world (theirs) becoming obsolete just because Brazil has 
radioactive minerals. This is why Archer defended, through 
Admiral Alvaro Alberto, the idea of only supplying radioactive 
minerals to the Americans in exchange for nuclear technology. 
  But the world powers have always rejected the "industrial 
lever effect" associated with nuclear energy. That is, in 
nuclear plants like Angra, high-technology equipment account for 
70 percent of the whole construction while civilian construction 
works account for 30 percent. These proportions are inverted in 
hydroelectric plants. 
  A nuclear bomb? Why has Brazil just signed the Tlatelolco 
Treaty to denuclearize Latin America? Why should they imagine 
that Brazil will start just as the Cold War is over, the USSR 
has disappeared from the map, and California is in crisis as 
consequence of the dismantling of its war industry? If we give 
up launching rockets just because they could carry bombs, we 
should also give up carrying knives because they can be used to 
kill. Why should we give up the fantastic autonomous program of 
Aramar [Navy nuclear project]? A country with more than 7,000 
km of coastal line cannot do without an atomic submarine. 
  Let us speak like adults: The future is too serious to let 
ourselves be influenced by environmentalists who even torture 
animals in publicity films to prove that progress is taking us 
backwards.

  [Text] Ottawa, 20 Jun (PL) -- Canadian Foreign Minister 
Andre Ouellet, announcing that his government is convinced it is 
"time to turn another page" in terms of relations with Cuba, 
today put an end to 16 years of suspending financial aid to Cuba. 
  "The Cold War is over," Ouellet said as he announced the 
resumption of official assistance to Cuba. Canada stopped 
aiding Cuba in 1978 after Cuba decided to give military aid to 
Angola in light of South African aggression. 
  Ouellet's announcement came at a time when Christine 
Stewart, 
Canadian minister of state for Latin America and Africa, was in 
Havana attending an economic conference on Cuba sponsored by the 
British publication THE ECONOMIST. 
  Official sources in this capital confirmed to the media that 
Stewart had planned to formally announce in Havana the 
resumption of Canadian aid to Cuba.

  [Text] Havana, 20 Jun (PL) -- Christine Stewart, Canadian 
minister of state for Latin America and Africa, arrived in Cuba 
today on a two-day working visit to review bilateral ties. 
  The top Canadian official will meet with Cuban Government 
officials and deliver a speech at the International Conference 
on Business Opportunities in Cuba promoted by the British 
magazine THE ECONOMIST, which will begin here on Monday. 
  A Canadian Embassy representative told PRENSA LATINA that 
this visit to Cuba falls within the framework of the political 
dialogue between the two countries, which has increased since 
1989 with the exchange of official visits. 
  Former Cuban Foreign Minister Ricardo Alarcon traveled to 
Ottawa that year, and the following year his Canadian 
counterpart, Louise Frechette, visited Havana, where she met 
with President Fidel Castro. Both countries have expressed 
their satisfaction over the development of the political 
dialogue and the expansion of economic ties. 
  Since the administration of Conservative Prime Minister 
Brian 
Mulroney, Canada has been strengthening its relations with Latin 
America. The current Liberal administration of Jean Chretien 
wants to consolidate those relations, particularly in the 
commercial arena, and has taken steps in that direction. 
  At the recent OAS General Assembly, Stewart called for 
breaking the isolation orchestrated against Cuba and advocated 
Cuba's return to that hemispheric organization. 
  Prior to that time, Canadian Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet 
stressed Ottawa's rejection of the U.S. blockade against Cuba 
and called for an end to the policy. 
  Canada and Mexico were the only countries in the hemisphere 
who in 1962 refused to accept U.S. demands that OAS 
member-countries break relations with the island.

  [Text] Havana, 20 Jun (PL) -- Cuban Vice President Carlos 
Lage today received Christine Stewart, Canadian minister of 
state for Latin America, who also met with other prominent Cuban 
officials and held talks termed positive. 
  Ricardo Alarcon, Ernesto Melendez, and Jose Luis Rodriguez, 
foreign investment, cooperation, and finance ministers 
respectively, also received Stewart during the first day of her 
two-day working visit to Cuba, which has a full agenda. An 
official from the Canadian Embassy in Havana said these were 
constructive and "very smooth" talks. 
  As she arrived in the Cuban capital last night, the 
official, 
also in charge of African affairs in Prime Minister Jean 
Chretien's liberal administration, pointed out one the 
objectives of her trip was to broaden bilateral ties. She also 
underscored that common programs could stem from these 
conversations. 
  Meanwhile, Foreign Affairs Minister Andre Ouellet said the 
Canadian Government today ended the 16-year suspension of 
official economic aid to Cuba, convinced that "now is the time 
to turn the page" on Cuba. 
  This aid was canceled on 1978 due to the Cuban military aid 
offered to Angola in view of the South African aggression. This 
decision, however, did not hinder bilateral relations, 
especially commercial and tourist relations, which thrived 
without difficulties. 
  According to Ottawa government sources, Canada will grant 
Cuba over $1 million worth of foodstuffs, mainly for children, 
between 1994 and 1995. Stewart is expected to make a public 
announcement regarding this aid tomorrow morning in Havana.

<F P=106> [Report by Elsy Fors: "Conference on Business With Cuba </F>
Exceeds Expectations"] 
  [Text] Havana, 16 Jun (PL) -- It was reported today that 
Cuba's image as an attractive destination for business, and 
investment has been confirmed by the 125 businessmen expected 
here beginning tomorrow to participate in a conference organized 
by the British magazine THE ECONOMIST. 
  The information provided by Octavio Castilla, vice minister 
for foreign investments and economic cooperation, indicated the 
Cuban Government has been invited to present its proposals for 
foreign investment and trade at this conference, which will be 
held at the Nacional Hotel on 20 to 22 June. 
  The participants include Former Spanish Economics Minister 
Carlos Solchaga; Cristine Stewart, Canadian minister of state 
for Latin America and Africa; and six executives from the 
Canadian Sherrit Company, which is cosponsoring the meeting. The 
Canadian company is also an important investor in Cuba's 
petroleum sector. 
  The organizers' original list of approximately 60 people has 
doubled. They indicated that the reason for the event is the 
dramatic changes in the Cuban economy, especially Cuba's policy 
of opening up to foreign investment and its efforts to diversify 
its foreign markets. 
  The introductory program distributed by THE ECONOMIST stated 
that Cuba's current severe difficulties present enormous 
challenges to the companies interested in the small Caribbean 
nation. But far from detracting interest, this situation seems 
to add incentives, judging from the participation in the 
conference for which THE ECONOMIST set a registration fee of 
$1,500. 
  Great Britain heads the list of participants with 29 
businessmen, Canada follows with 28, Spain with 16, Germany with 
13, Italy with seven, the Netherlands with five, and the United 
States with 10, including two Cuban-Americans. Latin America 
will participate with, among others, four delegates from 
Colombia, three from Mexico, and three from Venezuela. 
  The program calls for an analysis of Cuba's current economic 
situation and its outlook, international relations and regional 
integration, monetary policy and banking system, trade policy, 
industrialization strategy, incentives for foreign investment, 
and testimony by investors in Cuba. 
  According to the organizers, the meeting, which is called 
"Second Round Table With the Cuban Government," will enable 
international investors and corporate executives to familiarize 
themselves with and debate the aspects of Cuba that are of most 
interest to them. The meeting will also include panels of 
businessmen who are experienced in business dealings with Cuba. 
These include Bert Denkers, general manager of the ING bank of 
the Netherlands, and Michihiro Sindo, president of Daisin 
International of Japan. As part of the round table, there will 
also be workshops on key sectors of the Cuban economy, such as 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, tourism, and 
energy and mines. 
  Castilla said the participants include seven mining firms, 
five tourism companies, five automobile industry 
representatives, five consultants, and a similar number from the 
academic sphere -- university researchers on Cuba. The Cuban 
vice minister indicated that similar events were held in 1992 
and 1993. They were organized by the British Euromoney 
publishing house and successfully made known business and 
investment opportunities in Cuba. 
  On this occasion, the meeting is enhanced by the promising 
discovery of petroleum on the island -- precisely with the 
participation of Sherritt from Canada -- and the profitable 
operation of other firms involved in the tourism sector and 
nickel mining, as well as the process of economic reforms whose 
most recent chapter involved financial reorganization measures. 
  Official Cuban sources commented that an additional draw for 
the participants is the on-site analysis of the limitations and 
the cracks in the U.S. blockade against Cuba.

<F P=106> [By special correspondent Abel Sardina] </F>
  [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 16 Jun (PL) -- Cuban President 
Fidel Castro today reiterated that the importance of the 
Ibero-American summits is based on the fact that this is the 
first time the Latin American countries have met without being 
summoned to a meeting. 
  The legendary leader talked at length about this, about the 
progress and outlook of Latin America's integration, and the 
so-called Summit of the Americas called by the United States for 
late 1994, at a meeting with Colombian solidarity with Cuba 
organizations and during a meeting with Cuban reporters. 
  Castro stressed that just being present at the 
Ibero-American 
summit is very important for Cuba because for the first time, it 
was not excluded. Castro added that Mexico, host of the first 
summit, and other friendly nations, had much to do with this. 
  One of the fruits of these summits is that they have created 
an awareness for integration, he said, adding that the success 
should not be measured by specific achievements, as the 
expectations are not always met. 
  He said that those meetings have contributed to countering 
Cuba's isolation, creating greater awareness of the blockade it 
faces, teaching the United States a lesson, intensifying Cuban 
relations with many countries, and building closer relations 
with Latin America. 
  We are not working for the present, but for the future, he 
noted, adding that his country has participated in four summits 
and has made contributions on all the subjects discussed, giving 
special importance to education, health, and social development 
in general. 
  We have made great efforts to lift the spirit of the 
summits, 
to give them more meaning, Castro stressed. 
  With regard to Latin American integration, Castro said that 
there is still no real integration awareness in the region, but 
these summits contribute to that purpose. He said that the 
United States is the main obstacle, because it wants to 
disintegrate Latin America, and prevent it from becoming more 
independent. 
  He said that is why Washington is promoting bilateral 
agreements because, as it did with the foreign debt, which was 
negotiated on a one-to-one basis, it does not want to negotiate 
with a united Latin America. 
  Fidel Castro indicated that the Ibero-American summits are 
so 
important that our northern enemies became envious and invented 
another summit, precisely in Miami, which he said, they want to 
turn into Latin America's capital. 
  He reiterated, however, as he said during his speech at the 
Ibero-American summit, which ended here yesterday, that Cuba is 
not opposed to that meeting even though it considers its 
exclusion a cowardly act because the U.S. leaders are afraid of 
words, ideas, and truths and that shows political weakness. 
  He said that if invited he would go, even though it is held 
in Miami, but the organizers have already said it will not 
happen, and he explained that he is not opposed to the summit 
because he expects the Latin American countries to firmly defend 
the interests of the region. 
  I am pleased to see that the free summits, in which we have 
met without anyone's permission, have forced the United States 
to convene the one in Miami, and the selection of this site 
denotes a political objective, the top leader of the Cuban 
Revolution said. 
  Questioned on the assessment of the final declaration of 
this 
summit which is permeated by neoliberalism, he said that this 
philosophy is currently part of America's reality and that some 
have made it their religion; however, others have begun to see 
its other side. 
  These countries no longer talk enthusiastically about 
neoliberal policies, whose implementation has reduced inflation 
and has attained other achievements by slashing social 
expenditures. He added that even the United States is realizing 
it is digging its own grave; therefore, it is seeking to make 
some changes with regard to this issue.

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 16 Jun (PL) -- The friendship 
between Colombia and Cuba today overflowed as pro-Cuba 
solidarity organizations gathered here to greet President Fidel 
Castro. Some 400 people from several Colombian cities attended 
the meeting with the revolutionary leader at the auditorium of 
Cartagena de Indias' Professionals Club. 
  One by one, the leaders of the friendship groups expressed 
to 
the Cuban leader their admiration and full support for the 
persistent resistance of his people to harassment by the United 
States. All speakers demanded the lifting of the U.S. blockade 
on Cuba and stressed their decision to continue to support what 
they called a "temporary period." Visibly moved, the president 
responded to their display of solidarity and answered some 
questions from attendees. 
  One of the questions was asked by a young 18-year-old girl, 
who asked Castro why he arrived in Colombia to attend the Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit wearing a guayabera instead of his 
traditional green army uniform. The revolutionary leader 
replied that he wore a guayabera in response to suggestions made 
by conference organizers, who asked the rulers to attend the 
summit wearing informal clothes to confront the hot Cartagena de 
Indias weather. He pointed out that he did not know whether he 
would return to his country in plainclothes, adding that he will 
definitely wear his legendary guerrilla uniform again. 
  Professionals Club President Carlos Cruz inspired a very 
special moment when he asked the Antillean chief of state to put 
his signature on the main wall of the auditorium, which will 
henceforth be called Fidel Castro Auditorium. The Cuban 
statesman grabbed a black marker and drafted his signature in 
big letters amid cheers and chants loudly uttered by 
sympathizers of the Cuban cause. Another affectionate and funny 
situation took place as the local Friendship Association gave 
him a long-sleeved white guayabera, similar to the one he wore 
on the first day of the summit.

  Havana PRENSA LATINA in Spanish at 0112 GMT on 15 June 
transmits the text of President Fidel Castro's speech at the 
Fourth Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. 
This version has been compared with the Havana Radio Rebelde 
Network in Spanish at 2300 GMT version published in the 15 June 
Latin America DAILY REPORT, pages 16-17, revealing the following 
variation: 
  Column two, paragraph one, sentence one reads: Esteemed 
President of Colombia, Cesar Gaviria; Your Majesty; excellencies: 
  Our summits that began in Guadalajara have been an example 
of 
inspiration for the rapprochement and unity of our peoples. We 
have reaffirmed our determination to meet without the permission 
of third parties and without aggravating exclusions. Our 
efforts have born fruit in many aspects. The progress made by 
Aladi [Latin American Integration Association], the Andean Pact, 
the Central American Common Market, Mercosur [Common Market of 
the South], and the growing importance of Sela [Latin American 
Economic System] is proof of this. 
  Some have felt, however, some concern due to this new and 
independent form of action. Our powerful neighbor of the north 
is now summoning another summit that will be held in Miami, of 
all places, it is said, for a mature hemispheric association. 
  There have already been an Alliance for Progress and an 
Initiative for the Americas. No one remembers them today. From 
decade to decade, from century to century, we have gone from 
slogan to slogan, from deceit to deceit. There were also wars, 
interventions, conquest of territories at a cost for our 
America. What can we expect today of that invariably 
expansionist, selfish, and hegemonic force? 
  Cuba, a country attacked and blockaded for more than 30 
years, is prohibited by the alleged owners of the hemisphere 
from participating in that meeting. How much cowardice, 
mediocrity, and political poverty is truly reflected by this 
exclusion. Cuba does not oppose that summit, however. We are 
pleased the brother countries of Latin America and the Caribbean 
will have an opportunity there to defend with complete firmness 
and strength the interests of our peoples. 
  First, it is time to demand that the sacred right to health, 
education, properly remunerated work, and the cultural and 
ethnic identity of your people be considered and respected as 
fundamental rights of man and that all forms of racial and 
sexual discrimination end. It is time to demand an end to 
homeless and abandoned children roaming the streets, victims of 
all forms of exploitation, violence, and sexual abuse. It is 
time to demand an end to hunger; an end to the millions of 
deaths each year, deaths that can be avoided. 
  Cuba has resolutely supported the revolutionary struggle for 
democratic processes in Central and South America and is happy 
the current U.S. Administration will not foster... (supplying 
additional material)

<F P=106> [By PRENSA LATINA contributor Carlos Fazio: "Ten Years of </F>
Baena Soares in the OAS"] 
  [Text] OAS Secretary General and Brazilian diplomat Joao 
Baena Soares will leave his post next 20 June. Trinidadian 
Christopher Thomas will temporarily replace him and pass it over 
to Cesar Gaviria, the new official elected to this post, in 
September, when Gaviria will conclude his term as Colombian 
president. 
  Baena Soares headed the OAS -- known as the "ministry of 
U.S. 
colonies," at one time, due to its acceptance of 
Washington-sponsored military dictatorships and condoning of 
U.S. invasions in the region -- for 10 years. 
  A cursory assessment of his work as head of the OAS must 
inevitably consider the international scope. In the period of 
1984 to 1994, the collapse of the Soviet Union, the 
disintegration of the Socialist bloc, and the death rattles of 
the Cold War all led to a new international disorder, which 
dealt pluralism a fatal blow and has kept the United Nations, 
the highest international forum, mired in a crisis of 
credibility. 
  Within that context, the virtual vanishing of the East-West 
division (communism versus capitalism) under the ruins of the 
Berlin Wall gave Washington the opportunity to revive its 
ancestral crusade against "Soviet expansionism" in Latin America 
and allowed the OAS the possibility to get rid of the 
traditional U.S. hegemony while heading toward a genuine 
ideological pluralism based on noninterference and 
self-determination guided by the principles in its charter. 
  We can categorically say Baena Soares did not achieve that 
goal, but, obviously, that is not his responsibility. The OAS 
was facing a crisis of its own when Baena Soares came to the OAS 
10 years ago. For instance, memories of the 1983 Falkland 
Islands War were still fresh, and this war unveiled the U.S. 
double game of proclaiming the defense of the Americas from 
foreign aggressions and finally buried the Inter-American 
Reciprocal Assistance Treaty [TIAR], because the United States 
sided with Great Britain against Argentina. In addition, the 
United States also invaded Grenada in 1983. 
  The Contadora Group (Mexico, Panama, Colombia, and 
Venezuela) 
was created in 1983 to seek a negotiated solution to the Central 
American conflict due to the virtual standstill in the OAS 
vis-a-vis a crisis in which the United States was directly 
involved. 
  In addition to the backwardness of pluralistic diplomacy and 
the powder keg of Central America (the covert CIA war against 
Sandinism in Nicaragua, the transformation of Honduras into the 
Pentagon's aircraft carrier on land, and Washington's direct 
involvement in the Salvadoran civil war), we must mention 
another key event of that period: the crisis triggered by the 
Latin American foreign debt, which reached huge proportions. 
  To mark the moment in which Baena Soares assumed his post as 
OAS secretary general, we must mention the transfer of over $132 
billion in capital from Latin America to the industrialized 
world during the period of 1981 to 1986. Paradoxically, the 
region, as a net exporter of financial resources, directly 
promoted the growth of certain industrialized economies. 
  All these circumstances, regulated by a search for genuine 
solutions, distinctly Latin American, to deep-rooted problems, 
marked the hegemonic crises of the State Department and the 
Pentagon in the region. 
  Historically, the OAS and TIAR had been U.S. diplomatic 
mechanisms in its ideological campaign against the Soviet Union, 
"the evil empire." Washington made use of these two 
organizations during the Cold War so that the Latin American 
countries would legitimize the U.S. hegemonic endeavors. 
Washington actually established a perverse relation based on a 
bipolar structure. Inter-Americanism (the old Monroe Doctrine, 
the basis of the prevailing Pan-Americanism during the latter 
part of the 19th century) became the best defense of the bulwark 
of the "free world" (America) against "Soviet communism." 
  That ideological scheme of domination came to an end during 
the mid-1980's, and certain Latin American countries, including 
Mexico, began to design new formulas for consensus and dialogue. 
These formulas were alternatives to Washington's favorite 
sophism, according to which force is the only mechanism to 
resolve differences among countries. 
  The Contadora Group expanded in 1986 and became known as the 
Group of Eight [G-8]. The G-8 started its discussions as the UN 
Latin American Regional Group (GRULA). It began as a Latin 
American commonwealth, but was reduced, by war, to a democratic 
partnership of eight countries and the supporting nations due to 
the Mexican theory that preached gradual change. 
  The Cartagena Consensus group and new integrationist ideals 
began to surface at that same time. These groups all seemed to 
converge, although there were differences, and strategically 
directed their efforts toward the creation of a community of 
Latin American nations. 
  The OAS appeared within this framework as a forum for 
North-South hemispheric dialogue; that is, a forum for dialogue 
between the United States and Latin America. In addition, Cuba, 
to what was then outlined with great caution, could be included 
again in the community of Latin American nations. 
  With the 1959 victory of the revolution, Cuba became a 
problem of "national security" for the United States. The early 
definition of the socialist character of the revolution led the 
White House to label Cuba as a "totalitarian" regime at the 
service of the USSR and, therefore, a "threat" to the 
hemisphere. In addition, Cuba was accused of "exporting" the 
revolution. 
  Under the OAS umbrella, Washington distanced Cuba from the 
hemispheric scenario. Its expulsion from the OAS in 1962 
prompted the joint, except for Mexico, breaking off of 
diplomatic relations in 1964 in the name of democracy and was 
based on the "incompatibility" of a Marxist-Leninist government 
like Fidel Castro's. Thus, Cuba became isolated from the "big 
Latin American family." 
  Nevertheless, 23 years later (1987) the United States 
watched 
with surprise and annoyance the "formal" resurgence of 
revolutionary Cuba in the subhemisphere when a possible and 
gradual reinsertion into the OAS was proposed at the G-8 
presidents meeting in Acapulco. The initiative was presented 
with calls for a "detailed revision" of the OAS. Until then, 
the OAS was seen as a pluralist system, free of any ideological 
discrimination and with reciprocal respect for the forms of 
government each member nation had decided upon within its 
exercise of self-determination. 
  Baena Soares' biggest merit, during this entire process of 
change, was not to shun direct involvement as an organization. 
In this manner, the OAS participated in the Second Esquipulas 
Agreement, and Baena Soares personally, together with his UN 
colleague, Javier Perez de Cuellar, integrated the International 
Commission of Verification and Follow-up. Subsequently, he was 
an honorary witness to the conversations between the Nicaraguan 
Government and the contras in Sapoa. 
  Likewise, and since the first Ibero-American Summit in 
Guadalajara (1991), Baena Soares has been integrated into this 
Latin American, Spanish, and Portuguese forum. 
  As [Spanish writer] Leopoldo Zea once said, under Baena 
Soares's administration, the OAS experienced an era of "Latin 
Americanization." 
  During this last period, one must mention the internal OAS 
dispute regarding militarization of the organization, as 
fostered by the Pentagon, in the name of "Hemispheric security," 
given the fall of the TIAR and the JID [Inter-American Defense 
Board.] 
  The "new OAS" hailed today is a venue by which Washington 
aims to legally test the controversial theory of "limited 
sovereignty," "humanitarian intervention," and "preventive 
democracy," although Somalia was a guinea pig. Because of this, 
certain amendments have been made to the bylaws of the 
organization. 
  Under the sponsorship of Argentina (as official spokesperson 
of the White House) and with only the opposition of Mexico, a 
reform to the 1993-approved bylaws in Managua permits the 
"suspension" of any member nation that strays from the rules 
considered democratic. This reform leaves a question mark on the 
future validity of the principles of the peoples' right to 
sovereignty and self-determination. That will be the package 
left for Baena Soares' successor, Cesar Gaviria.

  [Text] Havana, 19 Jun (PL) -- The Cuban Foreign Ministry 
[Minrex] today reiterated that only through a firm position with 
regard to the illegal occupation of diplomatic missions is it 
possible to avoid having these actions repeated. Cuba also 
confirmed that it will not grant anyone authorization to leave 
the country if they have entered a diplomatic mission by force, 
even if they subsequently leave the mission. No exceptions will 
be made. 
  A Minrex statement made reference to these actions, which 
first occurred on 28 May, by groups of people who entered the 
Belgian ambassador's residence, the German Embassy, and the 
Chilean Consulate in this capital. 
  Minrex indicated, as is known, that these actions are 
promoted from abroad as political propaganda and that the people 
involved in these actions are not subject to political 
persecution in any way. They have been denied a visa to legally 
travel by foreign countries. It adds that in the first two 
cases, Cuba had reiterated its position of principle on the 
illegality and the unacceptability of the practice of violating 
the diplomatic mission's immunity as a way to emigrate to other 
nations. It also points out, with regard to the Chilean 
Consulate, that by-laws regarding representation are different 
from those regarding diplomatic missions, therefore, no one can 
seek to obtain "protection at that site." 
  Minrex recalled that the practice of entering diplomatic 
missions or consulates in that manner, besides violating Cuban 
laws, also violates the principles provided for in international 
law and in these same type of agreements. It indicated that the 
sole solution for the people who have committed the 
abovementioned crime is to leave the occupied buildings 
peacefully and return to their homes. No legal action will be 
taken against them. 
  It signals that exoneration laws make reference to the 
action 
of illegally entering a site but do not, of course, include any 
other type of crime committed previously or during the violent 
entry into those sites. 
  Cuba assumes that position, the ministry states, to 
demonstrate its goodwill to the governments involved and to ease 
the way for the quickest solution to the problem, even though, 
by committing those criminal actions, these persons are joining 
the anti-Cuban campaign that is being promoted abroad and that 
violates the nation's laws. 
  In its statement, Minrex points out that the diplomatic 
missions, in turn, should take into account that the best 
guarantee for their own immunity lies in respecting the laws in 
force in the country to which they are accredited and that their 
duties should be carried out within the framework of this ruling 
and international law. 
  It concludes that the Vienna Agreement clearly indicates 
that 
diplomatic missions must respect the local laws and not meddle 
in the nation's internal matters and that their sites should not 
to be used in ways incompatible with their duties.

<F P=106> [By Patricia Grogg] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 16 Jun (PL) -- Cuba gave full guarantees to 
the Chilean authorities that no reprisals will be taken against 
the eight persons who illegally occupied the Chilean Consulate 
General in this capital yesterday. 
  According to Chilean Mission sources, the condition is for 
them to peacefully abandon the building that they trespassed on 
Wednesday morning by jumping the fence that surrounds the 
two-story building located in the elegant neighborhood of 
Miramar, in western Havana. 
  Chilean diplomatic officials told PRENSA LATINA that they 
would even be willing to escort them to their residences if they 
decide to leave. The Chilean officials said they decided to 
take in the occupiers strictly for humanitarian reasons. The 
group consists of six men and a woman, whose ages range between 
20 and 30 years, and a 12-year old boy. 
  "We hope that time will help us to convince them that as a 
consulate we cannot give them asylum and that their only option 
is to abandon the mission," sources close to the mission said. 
  According to international conventions and norms, a consular 
mission cannot grant political asylum. "We have explained it to 
them on several occasions, but they insist they want to leave 
the country," the source added. 
  Following a 17-year break in diplomatic relations, the two 
countries have maintained consular relations since 1991 as a 
result of an agreement reached between former President Patricio 
Aylwin and Cuban leader Fidel Castro in Guadalajara, Mexico, 
during the First Ibero-American Summit. 
  The officials have emphatically ruled out the use of force 
to 
compel the group to abandon the mission's grounds. 
  "The orders are not to use force at any time, the only road 
available is to convince them to leave," they said. 
  The occupiers remain in the building's back porch, and the 
consular authorities are guaranteeing them food, including milk 
for the boy. 
  They sleep outdoors on improvised mattresses, which is not 
that bad thanks to the high temperatures common to the Cuban 
summer season. 
  Even though they have not specifically shown an interest in 
traveling to the United States as their final destination, some 
of them said they have money to leave the country and that they 
have relatives in Miami, the U.S. city where most Cuban 
immigrants live. 
  Consul Patricio Pozo held an intense round of interviews 
this 
morning, apparently with Foreign Ministry officials, the 
contents and results of which are not yet known. 
  Meanwhile, the Cuban authorities reiterated yesterday to the 
diplomatic corps accredited here its decision to help resolve 
the situation created in the last two weeks following the 
illegal occupation of the Belgian ambassador's residence by 128 
persons, the German Embassy by 21 persons, and the Chilean 
Consulate. 
  Likewise, the authorities reiterated Cuba's official 
position 
not to accept illegal entry into diplomatic installations as a 
pressure mechanism for leaving the country. 
  The incident at the Chilean Consulate took place the day 
before the meeting between Fidel Castro and Chilean President 
Eduardo Frei in the framework of the bilateral meetings held by 
both presidents in Cartagena de Indias, site of the Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit. 
  Last Monday, coinciding with Mexican President Carlos 
Salinas 
de Gortari's visit to Havana, 21 Cuban citizens violently 
penetrated the German Embassy in a truck. 
  "My personal impression is that there is something in these 
coincidences," a Latin American diplomat, who preferred not to 
be identified, said.

  [Text] Havana, 19 Jun (PL) -- Another three illegal 
occupants of the residence of the Belgian ambassador in this 
capital voluntarily left the building this morning. 
  Police sources have confirmed this information. Now the 
number of people who have changed their mind and left the 
building in recent hours has climbed to 11. Seven persons have 
left in the past few days. According to local observers, this 
indicates that the idea that violent actions are useless is 
beginning to take hold among the group that forcefully entered 
the building on 28 May. 
  The Cuban Foreign Ministry today confirmed that whoever uses 
force to enter a diplomatic or consular installation in the 
country will lose the right to secure a visa to leave the 
country, even if they later leave the occupied diplomatic 
installation.

  [Text] Moscow, 16 Jun (PL) -- Russia and Cuba today signed 
the bylaws of the international association Ros-Cuba, an 
institution created to foster cooperation in the fields of 
production, finance, and scientific-technical investigation. 
  Lev Nogilevskiy and Pablo Martin, president and vice 
presidents of Ros-Cuba respectfully, signed the document, which 
establishes the legal bases for the operation and registration 
of the institution for Russian authorities. The main 
headquarters of Ros-Cuba will be installed in Russia. 
  The ceremony was held at the Caribbean island's diplomatic 
mission in this capital. Lionel Soto, Council of Ministers vice 
president who is on a working tour through the former Soviet 
nations, was present. 
  The agreement to organize Ros-Cuba was signed in October by 
Soto and Oleg Soskovets, first deputy chairman of the Council of 
Ministers, after several rounds of negotiations seeking new 
bases for bilateral cooperation. 
  At the close of the ceremony, Nogilevskiy termed as 
important 
the signing of the association bylaws, which seek to initiate a 
new stage in economic-trade ties between the two nations. 
  The president of Ros-Cuba thanked the Cuban Government and 
Cuban authorities who are in Russia for the facilities that were 
used while preparing the documents that were needed to start the 
international organization. 
  Ros-Cuba will be formed by businesses, state institutions, 
and businessmen from the two nations. Promoting services to 
third nations will also be one of its duties.

  [Text] Camaguey, Cuba, 15 Jun (PL) -- This province's first 
joint tourist enterprise was formed this week with the signing 
of an agreement between the Gaviota Tourist Group and the 
Spanish P and I hotel chain. 
  The signing of the document enables Gaviota to start 
operations in Camaguey, the largest Cuban province where 30 
percent of the country's beaches are located. As for the P and 
I company, it has become the first foreign business to embark on 
a joint venture with the Cuban tourist group. The goal of the 
new venture is to tap Guajaba Key, which has a 94-square-km area 
and 12 km of beautiful beaches in the northern region of this 
eastern Cuban province. 
  The construction of a small Caribbean-style town will begin 
immediately here (between Sabinal Key and Romano Key). The town 
will initially have 80 units, though the number will increase 
according to demand, and will cater to high-income tourists. 
The plans, drafted by Camaguey architect Leonel Carralero, 
include the construction of comfortable bungalows located around 
a central square, where the service facilities will be located. 
Guajaba Key, which is currently reached by sea, will soon have, 
among other facilities, a landing strip, golf courses, and a 
marina. 
  With this new investment, by late 1995 Gaviota will double 
its number of units, currently amounting to 1,170 rooms in 
Havana, Varadero, and Holguin.

  [Text] Havana, 16 Jun (PL) -- Mozambican National Assembly 
President Marcelino Dos Santos expressed here his government's 
and people's gratitude to Cuba for its contributions to his 
country's independence struggle. 
  During a meeting with Cuban internationalists who fought in 
Mozambique and on the occasion of the 19th anniversary of its 
independence from Portugal (25 June) Dos Santos recognized the 
help they received from Cuba during and after the armed struggle 
to consolidate and stabilize that nation. 
  Dos Santos, who is also president of the Mozambican-Cuban 
Friendship Committee, referred to the peace agreements signed in 
Rome in 1992 with the opposition movement Renamo [Mozambique 
National Resistance] and the difficulties in fully implementing 
those agreements due to maneuvers by that armed organization. 
  Dos Santos is currently on a visit to Cuba which will end on 
30 June. During his stay he will meet with several leaders and 
will tour centers of economic, historical, scientific, 
educational, and social interest.

LATINA): "The Cuban Armed Forces: In Search of Capabilities for 
Self-Financing"] 
  [Text] Havana -- The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba 
[FAR], considering they have already secured their main mission 
of guaranteeing the defense of the country's sovereignty and 
territory, have been working on utilizing more efficient methods 
to manage the economy, and the FAR has introduced multiple 
initiatives to create capabilities of self-financing. 
  This is the prevailing atmosphere among the high command and 
mid-ranking officers who have been charged with the complex task 
of making affordable military activities on the island. 
  General Leopoldo Cintras Frias, commander of the Western 
Army, told this reporter during a tour of regional installations 
the FAR leadership is demanding its officers possess four basic 
skills during the current economic difficulties. They must be 
good fighters, politicians, administrators, and farmers. 
  The tour included visits to a chemical regiment, an 
artillery 
regiment, the San Antonio de los Banos Air Force Base, the 
country's most important air base, tunnels for the defense and 
protection of the people, and a rearguard combined forces 
installation, among other places. 
  By opening certain installations that for more than three 
decades had been closed to civilians, the military wanted to 
convey several messages. One is that in case of an armed 
conflict, the fighters' lives and technology will be protected, 
made possible by the construction of high-protection tunnels 
spreading for kilometers in areas that are difficult to reach. 
  There are arms and ammunition in those tunnels as well as 
the 
necessary infrastructure for production and logistical needs to 
facilitate indefinite periods of fighting, something we noticed 
in the fields of operations, as the military calls those areas. 
Civilians will also be safe in those tunnels, which are areas 
well protected against air, heavy artillery, and other forms of 
attacks of mass destruction. 
  Consulted sources have reported the Cuban military has 
creatively resolved the challenge of training troops for combat. 
This training remains at a good level despite the break up of 
the European socialist bloc (from 1989 to 1991), a situation 
which produced an abrupt cut in the supply line for weapons, 
fuel, and spare parts, which had existed for the past three 
decades. 
  From the beginning of this process, the FAR, using different 
types of initiatives, was able to save fuel and materiel 
expended in training and was able to strictly maintain its 
technology. 
  There is a strategy in Cuba that guides the Armed Forces in 
conjunction with the situation and economic possibilities during 
a period of severe currency-exchange shortages. 
  At the San Antonio de los Banos Base, for example, 
electronic 
equipment located in cabins similar to airplane cabins is used 
by pilots being trained to simulate, on the ground, the most 
complex combat situations. According to specialists, a MiG 
training flight costs no less than $3,000 for fuel. The 
electronic equipment represents a considerable saving. 
  Another relevant aspect is the new profile assumed by the 
soldiers who are now engaged in agricultural works and business 
operations they had never touched. Each FAR unit has 
agricultural areas, raises livestock, and keeps poultry so that 
the troops have dependable supplies in peace or wartime. 
  The efforts are producing results. The FAR covered 50 
percent of its expenditures in 1993 with funds generated from 
their own units. 
  The Armed Forces also work hard on the artificial breeding 
of 
fishes and industrial and artisan production, which is directed 
at providing shoes, clothes, and utensil supplies that were 
previously imported. 
  The FAR plans to be self-sufficient in tubers, grains, 
fruits, vegetables, and spices in 1995 and be partially 
self-sufficient in fat and beef production, an objective that is 
both tactical and economic in nature. A special push is being 
given to aquaculture as a quick and economically viable way of 
supplying the troops with protein and securing the raw materials 
necessary for animal food. 
  Military production requires sustained growth. Material 
encouragement is used to secure it but, rather, without 
disregarding moral encouragement, which traditionally has 
yielded good results in the Armed Forces of Cuba.

  [Text] Pinar del Rio, Cuba, 15 Jun (PL) -- A gold mine, 
with a production capability of approximately 500 kg a year, was 
inaugurated in this western province with an initial yield of 
100 grams of this precious mineral. 
  The Canadian-built facilities are located in the Castellanos 
bed and use a system of zinc precipitation, which is widely used 
in the international gold industry, to extract the mineral. 
  According to mining authorities, this mine opens new 
possibilities for Cuba to diversify its economy. In addition to 
Castellanos, Cuba has gold deposits in the Isle of Youth 
(Delita), in the central province of Villa Clara (El Descanso), 
and in the eastern provinces of Camaguey (Jobabo) and Holguin 
(Aguas Claras). 
  The most promising of those gold deposits is the one located 
in Delita. Experts have concluded, however, that this is where 
gold extractions will be more difficult because the mineral is 
accompanied by large amounts of arsenic, which is definitely an 
undesirable element. 
  Cuba is divided into 37 areas for geological prospects. More 
than 20 contracts have been signed with foreign investors, 
particularly from Canada, for the exploration of solid minerals.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Miguel Lozano: "Faceless `Macetas' </F>
who have emerged in the shadow of the economic crisis, the Cuban 
nouveau riche, are currently more concerned about concealing 
their identity than increasing their capital."] 
  [Text] Havana -- Surprisingly, at their summer meetings 
with their electorates, delegates (councilmen) heard a demand 
which, perhaps, many of them deemed incredible: the people 
wanted the names of the nouveau riche, which the Cuban 
authorities had refused to disclose. 
  At the end of May, GRANMA blew the whistle when it reported 
that early on in the neighborhood assemblies it was widely 
requested that the media identify the "macetas" (wealthy people 
in popular jargon) affected by a recent decree whereby illicitly 
obtained properties would be confiscated. 
  This request was probably unexpected because the island's 
enormous difficulties would seem to have indicated that 
participants in the assemblies would have been more interested 
in important issues, having been subjected to widespread 
shortages, frequent power outages and a chaotic transportation 
system. 
  Now, nevertheless, the authorities believe this reaction is 
the result of widespread rejection of individuals who are 
profiting from the crisis caused by the loss of the dependable 
markets of the defunct socialist countries and the 
intensification of the U.S. blockade. 
  The background of this phenomenon shows that demands for the 
confiscation of the "macetas'" properties was widely agreed upon 
at the so-called "workers parliaments" held during the first 
quarter of this year, which were organized by the labor unions 
to find out the people's views concerning ways to deal with the 
country's economic problems. 
  In essence, the "macetas" are people who speculate on 
products that are scarce -- most of which are obtained illegally 
from state stores -- and have amassed true fortunes, the 
dimensions of which are only coming to light now. 
  The people's demand to confiscate the "macetas" properties 
was followed by the National Assembly's approval of guidelines 
to reorganize the economy, among them instructions to the 
government to adopt "efficient and exemplary" measures against 
those who accumulate wealth through the black market, illegal 
business deals and even theft. 
  Decree-Law 149 was approved by the State Council on 4 May, 
and 12 days later it went into effect. The decree-law included 
research mechanisms and, in many cases, called for cases to be 
reviewed before confiscations that would preclude the right to 
compensation. 
  During the first month, the Office of the Prosecutor opened 
over 220 files and imposed precautionary measures on almost 200 
cars, approximately 100 motorcycles, 50 trucks, several dozen 
tractors, over 100 homes, about a dozen boats, and over 3 
million pesos (equivalent to dollars). 
  The "macetas" are usually citizens who cannot justify the 
legality of a standard of living which by far exceeds their 
incomes. 
  Upon displaying temporarily seized properties, the 
television 
stations were careful not to show the faces of the people 
involved, based on the principle of not morally harming anyone, 
especially since during their trials they will have four 
opportunities to prove their innocence with documents. 
  Nevertheless, certain cases have leaked, such as that of a 
retiree who receives a pension of approximately 100 pesos 
monthly and who, within a short period, purchased two cars, one 
van and one truck, and amassed savings of 100,000 pesos; and 
that of an administrator who earns a salary of 117 pesos monthly 
and owns four motorboats, one motorcyle, and one truck. 
  It is obvious that some of the illegally obtained 
properties, 
including raw materials imported by the state, are being 
concealed because the "macetas" had time from the beginning of 
the debates to try to evade the measures. 
  Nevertheless, the issue for the authorities does not seem to 
be the success of the operation but the permanent enforcement of 
Decree-Law 149 as part of a plan to restore financial order in 
the country, including the implementation of a tax system. 
  One issue the Cuban Government clearly established from the 
beginning is that this is not a witch hunt or a frontal attack 
on self-employed workers, a sector that has been encouraged over 
the past few years as a means of finding a solution to the 
crisis and which includes almost 160,000 people throughout the 
country. 
  Instead, the struggle against the "macetas" is part of an 
operation to deal with the lack of control and permissiveness 
which, to a large extent, make possible the existence of 
speculators and the black market. 
  According to Finance Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez, one of 
the 
first signs of the effectiveness of the plan is the improvement 
of social discipline, shown in the sale of cigarettes, which 
were deregulated on 1 June. Until then, cigarettes had been 
rationed. 
  Contrary to expectation, when the Cuban people were able to 
purchase cigarettes quota-free after such a long time, there was 
no avalanche. On the first day, 5.5 million pesos were sold; on 
the second day, 3 million pesos; and on the third day, 2.5 
million pesos. 
  Rodriguez believe this was the case because there were no 
speculative purchases, but he suspects that it would have been 
different if the "macetas" had not been under society's 
magnifying glass at the time. 
  More concerned with concealing their faces than in 
increasing 
their capital, the nouveau riche had to let the opportunity go 
by, and the Cuban people received a brief respite in the middle 
of a quite complicated daily life... at any rate, however, they 
are waiting to find out who -- paradoxically -- enriched 
themselves through the shortage.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Pedro Margolles Villanueva, </F>
president of PRENSA LATINA's Board of Directors: "Thirty-Five 
Years, Come Hell or High Water"] 
  [Text] [no dateline as received] It was still common to see 
a bearded man with a submachine gun dressed in an olive green 
uniform with rebel army badges on it in the streets of Havana. 
The Cuban revolution was making a strong impact on the world. 
It was June 1959. 
  Jorge Ricardo Masetti, an Argentine journalist, had 
interviewed Fidel Castro and Che Guevara in the Sierra Maestra a 
few months earlier, smack dab in the middle of the fighting 
against Fulgencio Batista's dictatorship. Masetti was in Havana 
again and wanted to create a different kind of news agency. He 
requested the cooperation of several young Latin American and 
Cuban journalists and, with the revolution's support, created 
the Latin American News Agency, PRENSA LATINA. 
  The idea for a news agency of this kind stemmed from a 
reality imposed by the circumstances at that time; that is, the 
monopoly that transnational news agencies exercised and still 
exercise. Every day these agencies transmit hundreds of news 
items on Latin America and the undeveloped world that present a 
distorted picture that is detrimental to the area's interests. 
These agencies, primarily the U.S.-based ones, were waging a 
strong campaign against Cuba and the revolutionary government's 
first social justice measures. It was necessary to spread Latin 
America's own informational concept and to reach the majority of 
our countries. That is how PRENSA LATINA emerged 35 years ago. 
  The agency's creation did not go unnoticed. Some 
commentators predicted it would last only a few months, but the 
dream, with all its ups and downs, continues. We are still 
present in 21 countries and reach 19 of them every day with 
objective, truthful reports on the national situation and that 
of the rest of the Third World. 
  PRENSA LATINA has become a modest media complex that 
publishes the magazines PRISMA -- already in its 20th year -- 
and CUBA INTERNACIONAL, has its own television department (TV 
Latina), and offers printed and radio bulletin services. PRENSA 
LATINA has created its own advertising agency, PUBLIMAGEN, and 
prepares promotional materials aimed at the market. More than 
130 reporters keep PRENSA LATINA operating around the clock 
under complex conditions. We serve customers in Latin America 
and Cuba and strive to improve our services to the Latin 
American and world press. 
  In the past few years, PRENSA LATINA has achieved a 
significant technological transformation by installing an 
automated news monitoring and broadcasting system devised by its 
own engineers. The agency's primary importance, however, does 
not lie in the display of large resources or sophisticated 
technology but in its well-known prestige and authority among 
news media and professionals around the world. PRENSA LATINA 
helped found and actively collaborates with the Non-Aligned News 
Agencies Pool and the Association of Latin American National 
Information Systems (ASIN). 
  In addition, PRENSA LATINA upholds the principle of the need 
for a new order of information and communications because 
inequalities regarding access to and handling of information 
persist. Powerful consortiums have the upper hand and impose a 
news flow detrimental to undeveloped countries, which continue 
to regard the concepts and ideas of independence and sovereignty 
as their inalienable rights. Information and communications must 
serve as instruments of understanding rather than hostility and 
dominance among men. 
  For several years PRENSA LATINA has been promoting the 
highest values of Latin American journalism and sponsoring the 
Jose Marti Award, created in 1986. Anyone who has published 
works on the nation's situation and on our struggle for social 
justice is eligible to compete. 
  On 15 June, the agency commemorates its 35th anniversary 
with 
the determination to keep uniting voices and to exercise a 
genuine, independent, integrated, sincere, and articulate 
journalism. This is the example set by dozens of Latin American 
and Cuban journalists who learned the trade in some of their 
editor's offices, worked as correspondents, or fulfilled 
dangerous assignments. Most of them feel they are part of the 
agency which, as Galeano said, keeps sailing come hell or high 
water.

  [Text] The leader of the Dominica Labor Party, Rosie 
Douglas, has chastised the governments of the region for not 
coming to the rescue of Haiti. Douglas, who was also a panelist 
on the "One" discussion program, noted that in light of the end 
of the Cold War and the quest for economic cooperation in the 
region, Caribbean governments [words indistinct] time ago. He 
suggested that the governments join hands with the Black Caucus 
of the United States in the current move to pressure the Clinton 
administration to bring down the illegal regime in Haiti. 
  [Begin Douglas recording] We are going to impose a serious 
blockade, not without [words indistinct] spoke to the government 
in Santo Domingo who would send military advisors that will 
ensure that no oil flows to Haiti. That kind of embargo is much 
more serious. And I think the Caribbean governments realize it 
is at that point when the United States drifted away from the 
original objective of ridding the country of that kind of 
dictatorship. That is where the Caribbean governments [words 
indistinct] the Cold War is over [word indistinct] to that 
return now that they are associate membership in Santo Domingo, 
now that they have broken the ice with Cuba. 
  I think that at that time, the Caribbean as a group should 
have stood up to [word indistincts]. But they are still more or 
less simply endorsing what the United States is doing, but they 
themselves are not taking up the kind of responsibility, in the 
light of the end of the Cold War, in the lack of the need of 
that kind of economic bloc in the Caribbean. They should have 
been the ones sticking up the [words indistinct] nothing through 
the back door -- Jamaica, Trinidad are ready, then talking as 
one voice -- Haiti is part of the Caribbean -- and linked 
through the Black Caucus. The Black Caucus would like the 
Caribbean leaders to link much closer to them, and tell Mr. 
Clinton, look, action must be taken. I believe now that the 
approach we take now on the pressure from the Black Caucus will 
see the end of that dictatorship, certainly before the end of 
this year. [end recording]

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 20 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Committee for 
the Defense of Democracy in the Dominican Republic today 
paralyzed three Valverde districts to protest the fraud 
committed in the 16 May general elections, local police sources 
reported. 
  The protest, which was organized by opposition political 
parties, affected Esperanza, Mao, and Laguna Salada, where 
stores closed and urban and intra-urban transportation 
decreased, a Dominican radio station reported. 
  Some 20 people were arrested and are under investigation for 
throwing tacks on the streets, burning tires, and detonating 
explosive devices, police reports stated. 
  Committee members were linked to the Santo Domingo 
Agreement, 
which established a coalition made up of opposition parties led 
by Jose Francisco Pena Gomez of the Dominican Revolutionary 
Party (PRD) and the Democratic Union (UD). 
  Pena Gomez, who was favored to win the elections in the 
Dominican Republic, today reiterated his charges of electoral 
fraud and presented the Central Electoral Board [JCE] with "new 
evidence" that holds that organization responsible for the 
irregularities. 
  JCE initial results show that President Joaquin Balaguer, 
candidate for the Social Christian Reformist Party (PRSC), is 
leading by a minimum margin, but electoral authorities have not 
yet proclaimed his victory. 
  JCE President Manuel Garcia Lizardo reaffirmed that the 
board 
will not proclaim a winner yet based on the official results of 
the elections because every one of the reported irregularities 
is being investigated. 
  Meanwhile, Balaguer and Dante Caputo, UN envoy to Haiti, 
discussed the Haitian crisis behind closed doors. Caputo, who 
arrived in the morning, refused to give details on his meeting 
with Balaguer, but said they discussed international initiatives 
on the Haitian case.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 20 Jun (EFE) -- Today, a U.S. Coast 
Guard vessel intercepted a Haitian vessel transporting food and 
textiles from Miami to the Haitian northern coast, sources from 
the Dominican Republic's Defense Ministry told EFE. 
  The boat, named "Roxanna," with registration number 
AK212-212, was intercepted in front of the Dominican Port of 
Manzanillo, close to the Haitian border, in the Dominican 
Republic's northwestern region. The vessel was delivered to the 
Dominican Navy at the Puerto Plata dock in the Dominican 
Atlantic Coast, where two other Haitian vessels are being held. 
  The ship was transporting wheat flour, vegetable oil, rice, 
other food products, and some textiles. The crew members -- the 
exact number was not specified -- are being interrogated in 
Puerto Plata by Dominican authorities, who have strengthened the 
embargo -- on the economy, oil, and weapons -- declared in a UN 
resolution to force the Haitian military leaders to surrender 
power and to permit the return of deposed President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide.

  [Text] Bernard Sansaricq, president of the branch of the 
Senate controlled by the Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion, 
has called on Haitian authorities to guarantee the safety of 
foreign nationals living on Haitian territory to avoid any 
pretext for military intervention by the international 
community. Sansaricq has asserted that the Senate will take all 
necessary measures to manage the situation. 
  [Begin recording, in Creole] [Sansaricq] Personally, I 
guarantee the international community that the Senate of the 
Republic will do its best to protect the safety and lives 
[pauses] so no attacks are perpetrated against foreigners in 
Haiti because what they want to show is that we are a band of 
wild people who cannot lead our country. 
  [Unidentified journalist] So you think that the 
international 
community has put economic diplomatic pressure on us, but that 
the threat of military intervention is not certain, contrary to 
what is being said? 
  [Sansaricq] There is no reason to invade Haiti because we 
are 
a peaceful country. If President Clinton takes upon himself the 
responsibility for putting a half-crazy man back in power -- a 
pro-Libyan, pro-Castroist, a man who could have established 
democracy in Haiti but did not -- I think President Clinton will 
regret it because he will have many problems, not in Haiti, but 
in the United States, with his own people, 65 percent of whom 
tell him no, do not enter Haiti. 
  We will do our best to manage the situation. If the 
intervention comes, we can do nothing about that. We will manage 
it the way it comes. We can do nothing about it, but we always 
[pauses] we would not like our country to be invaded. [end

  [Text] On 18 June, Judge Emile Jonassaint's provisional 
government declared some of the nation's strategic zones to be 
emergency zones, within the framework of the state of emergency. 
  The Haitian-Dominican border is just one of those zones. The 
decree indicates that the innersea [not further specified] and 
Haiti's coastline are considered strategic zones, with limited 
access to Haitians and foreigners. Power stations, radio 
antenna, and telecommunications sites are also declared 
strategic zones, whose access is subject to security conditions 
established by concerned authorities. The use of photographic 
and filming devices and of radio communications is also subject 
to special authorization by the concerned administrative 
authorities in those strategic zones. 
  In addition, the government decree stressed that the latest 
international sanctions against Haiti constitute a blatant 
violation of human rights and are similar to genocide and that 
increased sanctions could provoke a fratricidal war in the 
country.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 20 Jun (AFP) -- This morning, 
Haiti's provisional President Emile Jonassaint, who has not been 
acknowledged as such by the international community, personally 
hoisted his country's blue and red flag in front of the National 
Palace as numerous Haitian and foreign journalists watched. 
  Earlier, an official communique had announced that "from now 
on, the national flag will remain at the top of the flagpole 
until further notice, and it will be saluted every morning. The 
daily ceremony of lowering the flag has been abolished." The 
purpose of this measure is to strengthen the "flag's symbolism" 
to contribute to the safeguarding of "national independence." 
  Bernard Sansaricq, president of one of the Senate's 
opposition blocs (not acknowledged by the international 
community), and Army Chief General Raoul Cedras, along with the 
Haitian military high command, were at Jonassaint's side.

  [Text] The Association of Committed Protestant Pastors and 
Leaders [APLPE] takes a position. The association is calling on 
the Christian people of Haiti to resist, and reminds them that, 
like the people of Israel, the defense of the homeland against 
the attack of invaders, is sacred. According to the Association 
of Committed Protestant Pastors and Leaders, the embargo that 
the association calls unfair and criminal, imposed on Haiti by 
the international community, constitutes an attack on human 
rights, and the various UN resolutions are an open invitation 
for an invasion of the Haitian national territory and violates 
the spirit of the organization. 
  The association notes that several political and 
socioprofessional organizations have made proposals for a 
solution to the crisis, and that the international community has 
faced failure after failure in its attempt to restore a 
fictitious democracy in Haiti. Therefore, the Association of 
Committed Protestant Pastors and Leaders calls on the Christian 
people to organize a resistance and reminds them that like the 
people of Israel, the defense of the homeland against invaders 
is sacred. 
  This press release was signed by Dr. Jacques Jovin, 
president 
of the Association of Committed Protestant Pastors and Leaders.

  [Text] Military intervention is quite likely the solution 
to the present dictatorship in strife-torn Haiti. That is the 
view of St. Lucia Ambassador to the United Nations, Dr. Charles 
Fleming. Speaking on the discussion program "One," on (Helen) 
Television System, Dr. Fleming refuted claims that the United 
Nations does not regard the Haitian crisis as a priority. 
According to Ambassador Fleming, the treatment accorded Haiti 
by the United Nations is perhaps one which many other countries 
with similar problems are yet to receive. 
  [Begin Fleming recording] Since Aristide was overthrown, we 
have had coup d'etats elsewhere and the UN has done nothing. So 
certainly, Haiti is certainly a priority for the international 
community. The reason I don't want to eliminate military 
intervention as an option is because Haiti is by far the poorest 
country on which economic sanctions have ever been imposed, and 
as we discussed economic sanctions at the United Nations, we 
kind of agreed how long would we keep these sanctions on. You 
can't keep them on indefinitely because you would be in essence 
be killing off the poor people. So there has to be a time when 
we say okay, the sanctions are not working. What are we going to 
do? I agree that if Cedras goes into the bunker with several 
cans of corned beef, he can outlast the sanction for many, many 
years. So there has to be a final option. If we've agreed that 
we are going to find a solution to Haiti, based on the fact that 
the traditions in Haiti of coups d'etat and instability are 
really destroying the country and hurting the poor people, then 
we have to have a terminal solution if need be, and that's a 
military option. And I'm pleased that, in fact, Aristide himself 
has come around and agreed that a military option should be 
considered. [end recording]

  [Text] The Attorney General's Office [PGR] has undertaken a 
direct and decisive struggle against drug consumption. The PGR, 
which is headed by Humberto Benitez Trevino, has begun a 
campaign in Mexico City to prevent crime. The sale, 
distribution, and consumption of drugs are the first of a number 
of federal crimes about which citizens will receive information. 
For this purpose, the PGR has distributed posters in 
discotheques and restaurants in Mexico City, especially in the 
Zona Rosa, which is usually crowded with young people. The 
posters have been placed mainly in rest rooms and have the 
objective of making known to youths the dangers that the 
consumption and sale of drugs represent. 
  In the next few days, this crime prevention campaign will be 
extended to the entire country and will deal with various 
crimes, such as the illegal possession of firearms and the theft 
of archaeological artifacts. The colorful posters have the 
objective of preventing rather than just lamenting crimes. The 
struggle against drug addiction must begin from childhood and 
continue with greater intensity during adolescence.

  [Text] San Luis Potosi, San Luis Potosi State, 15 Jun -- 
This morning, the Matehuala Municipality Federal Highway and 
Port Police (PFCP) confiscated a shipment of 13,200 rounds of 
ammunition of various calibers, allegedly destined for 
Tejupilco, Mexico State. 
  Francisco Javier Najera coordinated the confiscation. He 
explained the incidents occurred at km 180 of Highway 57, 
Mexico-Piedras Negras, on the stretch between Matehuala and El 
Retorno, when a pickup truck with Texas license plate No. 
JO-1862 was being driven over the speed limit by Mexican citizen 
Honorio Saucedo Moreno, 29, without its tail lights on, and for 
that reason he was stopped. 
  The authorities seized 13,200 rounds of ammunition for 9-mm 
weapons and varies amounts of ammunition for 223 [not further 
specified], 30-30 carbines, .44 revolvers, .38 specials, .38 
supers, .37 supers, as well as for 7.62's, 30-mm, and 25- and 
22- caliber carbines. 
  In preliminary statements made to Hector Manuel Enriquez 
Marquez, an Attorney General's Office official in Matehuala 
Municipality, Saucedo said he was hired in Houston, Texas, to 
transport the shipment to Tejupilco, Mexico State.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Defense Secretary General Antonio </F>
Riviello Bazan by Jesus Casasola "on the occasion of the 
commemoration of freedom of speech;" place and date not given; 
from the "Evening News Panorama" newscast] 
  [Text] Mexican Defense Secretary General Antonio Riviello 
Bazan has affirmed that the National Army will not patrol the 
streets of Mexico during the 21 August elections and that its 
only role in that process will be to safeguard the electoral 
balloting material. 
  Gen. Riviello said the Army is apolitical and is ready to 
serve whomever the people elect in the August elections. 
Regarding the troop movement in Guerrero State, the defense 
secretary said there is nothing abnormal about it. 
  [Begin Riviello recording] Right now the citizens are 
working 
normally amid peace and tranquillity. The Armed Forces must 
fulfill their constitutional role. They are called upon to 
fulfill their constitutional mission throughout the republic. 
We are represented by the military zones, which are called upon 
to be aware of the national problems and of the jurisdiction of 
national defense organizations. [end recording] 
  Defense Secretary Gen. Antonio Riviello breakfasted with 
reporters this morning on the occasion of the commemoration of 
freedom of speech. He said there is social peace in Mexico and 
that the Defense Secretariat does not know of any specific 
problem that could destabilize the country, such as weapons 
smuggling. 
  [Begin recording] [Casasola] During this time of political 
activity, there is a climate of social peace in the country, 
Defense Secretary Gen. Antonio Riviella stated. He said the 
Mexican Army will always preserve the sovereignty and security 
of the people. Interviewed at the end of the breakfast held on 
the occasion of the commemoration of freedom of speech, he said 
the Armed Forces' commitments are to support society in case of 
disasters or tasks as important as fighting drug trafficking to 
benefit Mexican society. 
  [Riviello] There has been a profound modification in the 
National Defense Secretariat, both in its objectives and its 
achievements. Perhaps with more calm, I will gladly talk about 
that. 
  [Casasola] How does the social peace situation stand at the 
moment, Sir? 
  [Riviello] Well, the citizens are dedicated to their normal 
activities, working normally and calmly amid peace and 
tranquillity. 
  [Casasola] Mr. Secretary, what exactly did you mean when you 
said the Armed Forces are keeping abreast of things in Oaxaca, 
Guerrero? 
  [Riviello] The citizens are working normally amid peace and 
tranquillity. The Armed Forces must fulfill the constitutional 
role assigned to them. They are called upon to fulfill their 
constitutional mission throughout the republic. 
  [Casasola] Do you mean throughout the entire republic? 
  [Riviello] Yes, throughout the country we are represented by 
the military zones, which are supposed to stay abreast of 
problems involving national defense. 
  [Casasola] Could any problems arise at this time? 
  [Riviello] So far, no. 
  [Casasola] Could problems be greater than those that already 
exist? 
  [Riviello] I have no information about that. [end recording] 
  Antonio Riviello Bazan denied that there is arms 
trafficking. 
He said no shipments of AK-47 rifles have been detected. He 
did comment, however, on weapons seized during the 
counternarcotics campaign of the present administration. 
  [Begin recording] [Riviello] As you have seen in the media, 
we have seized over 133,000 weapons during this administration. 
We have not confirmed any massive smuggling of weapons. It is 
our obligation and that of other government offices to ensure 
that this does not occur. 
  [Casasola] Is this equipment very sophisticated? 
  [Riviello] No, the type seized by the Defense Secretariat is 
of all types, revolvers, rifles. [end recording] 
  In his speech, Antonio Riviello Bazan recognized the work 
carried out by Mexican reporters, saying they have become a 
decisive force in the country's democratic life. During the 
interview, he added that the Mexican Army is apolitical and will 
support the president elected by the people in the 21 August 
elections.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the elections scheduled for 
21 August. 
  Tens of thousands of National Autonomous University of 
Mexico 
students and faculty members cheered Party of the Democratic 
Revolution [PRD] presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas 
during a 6 June campus rally. Cardenas warned students that 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has "set up the mechanisms 
to commit electoral fraud" and called for a "deluge of 
democratic votes" to overcome the stumbling blocks, traps, and 
fraud. Cardenas said the three essential conditions for 
transition toward democracy are: 1) support for an active and 
involved civilian society; 2) following Cardenas' victory, the 
beginning of a transition toward democracy; and 3) a complete 
revision of constitutional bases and an open debate on a new 
constitution. (Monterrey EL NORTE (Foreign Edition) in Spanish 
7 Jun 94 p 1A) 
  According to a survey published today in VOZ Y VOTO 
magazine, 
the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] has lost 13 percent 
of its voter support in three years and now registers only 48 
percent voter support. The PRI received 61.47 percent of the 
votes in the 1991 Federal District election. The poll was 
conducted between 13 and 17 May following the public debate 
between presidential candidates Zedillo, Fernandez de Cevallos, 
and Cardenas. Results show the PRI would get 48 percent of the 
votes; the National Action Party [PAN], 26 percent; the PRD, 9 
percent; the Labor Party [PT], 1.48 percent; the Mexican Green 
Ecologist Party [PVEM], 0.84 percent; the Popular Socialist 
Party [PPS], 0.71 percent; the Cardenist Front for National 
Reconstruction Party [PFCRN], 0.32 percent; and the Authentic 
Party of the Mexican Revolution [PARM] and the National 
Opposition Union [UNO], 0.26 percent each. Only 2 percent of 
those polled indicated they would not vote, and 11 percent 
declined to respond. Polled on personal versus party appeal, 
the results varied slightly: PRI presidential candidate Ernesto 
Zedillo would get 49 percent of the votes; PAN candidate Diego 
Fernandez de Cevallos, 26 percent; PRD candidate Cuauhtemoc 
Cardenas, 11 percent; PFCRN candidate Rafael Aguilar Talamantes 
and PT candidate Cecilia Soto, 2 percent each; and UNO candidate 
Pablo Emilio Madero, 1 percent. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 1816 GMT 
9 Jun 94) 
  PRI candidate Ernesto Zedillo visited a Mexico City railroad 
station and received an enthusiastic welcome from workers, whom 
he promised he would give an unprecedented boost to rail 
transportation and improve living conditions for railroad 
workers. Zedillo said the only acceptable government is that 
which is based on valid elections, adding that he was sure "the 
people would disregard any call to attack institutional rule and 
the social tranquillity and unity of Mexicans." Zedillo later 
met with small and medium business representatives, who listened 
with interest to the PRI economic platform. (Mexico City XEW 
Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 14 Jun 94) 
  Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, PAN presidential candidate, 
said 
that although the failure to reach a peace agreement in Chiapas 
is disturbing, it is important that the cease-fire be maintained 
and that the two parties remain willing to continue talks. 
(Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 14 Jun 
94) 
  Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, PRD presidential candidate, 
said in Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua State, that the failure of the 
government and of the armed groups in Chiapas to reach a peace 
agreement should not affect the 21 August elections, nor should 
it create an atmosphere of instability in the country. Cardenas 
later met with businessmen in Ciudad Juarez and told them it was 
necessary to broaden the jurisdiction of state and national 
human rights groups by extending "their purview to political and 
labor rights to give greater protection to the rights of all 
citizens according to the Constitution and the laws." (Mexico 
City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 14 Jun 94) 
  PARM presidential candidate Alvaro Perez Trevino said 
during the second day of a campaign tour through Zacatecas that 
a 70-percent voter turnout would be a genuine representation of 
Mexican citizens in the presidential elections. Trevino was to 
meet with the university's law school students, but the meeting 
was canceled due to poor attendance. (Mexico City XEW 
Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 14 Jun 94) 
  Referring to the Zapatist National Liberation Army's (EZLN) 
rejection of the Chiapas peace proposal in Veracruz, PT 
presidential candidate Cecilia Soto said that "a more precarious 
peace now exists." She proposed the creation of a secretariat 
for women to protect women in the labor and legal fields. Soto 
met with PT party leaders and supporters in Veracruz. (Mexico 
City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 14 Jun 94) 
  Jorge Gonzalez Torres, PVEM presidential candidate, arrived 
in Oaxaca on 13 June to begin a 10-day tour of Indian 
communities in the Mizteca and coastal areas and on the Isthmus 
of Tehuantepec. Speaking of his commitment to the 
underprivileged classes in Mexico, Gonzales Torres said the 
issue is not just "drug trafficking but also includes poverty 
and the abandonment of peasants and the poor." (Mexico City XEW 
Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 14 Jun 94) 
  Asked about the recent events in Chiapas, PAN presidential 
candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos said the least the 
presidential candidates can do is show prudence and not assume 
opportunistic positions. He said he was not surprised by the 
EZLN's rejection of the proposal because it was obvious when the 
document was released that it would be rejected by the guerrilla 
group. The government's reply to the EZLN was not clear, 
Fernandez de Cevallos said. He recalled that Subcommander 
Marcos recently said that EZLN members felt deceived, "but 
fortunately they said they will not renew the violence." 
Fernandez de Cevallos said the EZLN insists on further 
negotiations and wants a new, prudent, and honest effort. He 
added that the candidates must assume "very delicate" positions. 
Fernandez de Cevallos said candidates could and should express 
their opinions on the issue, but warned that any proposal urging 
the EZLN or the government to take specific action could easily 
be viewed as opportunistic. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 
14 Jun 94 p 5) 
  Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, National Democratic Alliance (ADN) 
presidential candidate, told those who favor the postponement or 
cancellation of the elections that he will demand that the 
elections be held on 21 August as scheduled. During a visit to 
the Autonomous University of Ciudad Juarez (UACJ), Cardenas also 
asked the government and the EZLN to renew negotiations and 
establish conditions for a lasting peace as soon as possible. 
  Cardenas added that the ADN would work within the law and 
also demand that the law be respected and that the votes be 
counted fairly. During a morning news conference, he said he 
did not believe the EZLN announcement rejecting the government 
offer would affect the upcoming elections. He said the 
government must seek solutions to local, state, and national 
issues raised by the EZLN, such as how the government can 
guarantee clean elections and improve health and education. 
Cardenas said PRI candidate Zedillo's question to Peace 
Commissioner Manuel Luis Camacho -- Why has the peace effort 
failed? -- was directed at the wrong person. "The question 
should be asked of President Salinas de Gortari," Cardenas said, 
adding that the recent car bombing incident in Guadalajara "is 
evidence of the social disintegration caused by the current 
government." (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 14 Jun 94 p 6)

  [Text] Two people were arrested for possession of 
"capsules" of heroin, a case considered the first of this type 
in El Salvador. 
  Juan Ernesto Vaengas Henriquez, 42, and Adrian Antonio Rodas 
Guevara, 46, were arrested by the Narcotics Division of the 
National Civilian Police and are accused of transporting 48 
white, powdered pills encased in plastic. Upon analysis, these 
pills were determined to be heroin. 
  The gross weight is estimated at 246.8 grams with an 
estimated street value of 129,579 colones. 
  According to the police report, the arrest was made on 13 
June when the individuals were traveling by motorcycle, license 
plate No. M-25-171, down 79th Avenida Norte in the western 
neighborhood of Escalon. 
  The police claim that the two had said they were involved in 
drug trafficking and that international drug traffickers had 
delivered to them the confiscated packages to be marketed in the 
country. 
  Meanwhile, the detained have denied the charges, saying 
"they 
never had anything to do with that type of business." 
  Venegas has said he was an unemployed driver. He had on him 
almost 300 colones when the seizure was made. 
  Rodas Guevara, who has held several jobs, a resident of San 
Bartolo, Ilopango, had 30 colones in cash on him at the time of 
arrest. Both individuals were placed at the disposal of the 5th 
Penal Court of San Salvador. 
  According to chemists, heroin is a drug stronger than 
cocaine 
and is priced at an estimated $60 per gram as opposed to $25 per 
gram for cocaine. 
  The main laboratories for the production of heroin in Latin 
America are found in underground operations in Mexico, some in 
Guatemala, and lately some in Colombia. The drug is extracted 
from the plant know as the poppy through very sophisticated 
procedures. Addicts use it through injections, diluted in water, 
or in special liquids. 
  This is the first time, as we stated, heroin has been 
uncovered in Salvador.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 17 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- On Thursday, 
Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio stressed that the 
strengthening of the Central American bloc was the most 
significant achievement of this week's Fourth Ibero-American 
Summit in Colombia. 
  When he returned to Guatemala, De Leon told the press that 
the six countries agreed that in the future there will be no 
bilateral negotiations, except in very special cases, because 
from now on everything will be done as a single bloc. In 
discussing specific achievements, he mentioned the 
capitalization of the Central American Bank of Economic 
Integration (BCIE) with the support of Argentina (which will 
contribute $70 million), while Colombia and Venezuela are 
awaiting final approval of contributions of $70 million and $122 
million, respectively. 
  The Central American presidents also met with the leaders of 
Chile, Spain, and Mexico, but they had to cancel their meeting 
with Brazilian counterpart Itamar Franco, who had to leave 
early. Mexico is already an extra-regional partner which has 
contributed $122 million to the region. 
  De Leon said the Central American bloc was looking for $700 
million to strengthen "our financial arm" and to carry out the 
region's Alliance for Sustainable Development project.

  [Text] The Nicaraguan Foreign Relations Ministry 
Information and Communications Directorate has clarified the 
Nicaraguan Government's position on the possible return of Cuba 
to the OAS and on the U.S. embargo of that island. An AFP news 
dispatch, which was published by BARRICADA on 15 June 1994, 
addressed those issues and took statements made by Deputy 
Foreign Minister Dr. Jose Pallais out of context, presenting an 
incomplete picture. 
  Acting Foreign Minister Dr. Jose Pallais, asked if Nicaragua 
supports Cuba's reinstatement to the OAS, told foreign 
correspondents in Nicaragua: "Nicaragua supports it, but Cuba 
must obviously show some willingness to adopt and share the 
changes that the inter-American system has experienced within 
the OAS and the principles and values that the OAS developed in 
the 1990's." 
  As for the embargo against Cuba, he stated: "Nicaragua, as 
all Latin American countries, and based on its own experience, 
does not believe that confrontation and isolation help solve 
national problems. In Nicaragua we realized that confrontation, 
war, and embargoes do not work, but consensus, dialogue, and 
understanding do. Nicaragua and this government are the 
products of this dialogue. It is therefore logical that we 
cannot support practices that contradict what we have found to 
be successful in our country." 
  Jose Pallais added: "The embargo is a unilateral position of 
the United States. We do not believe in such measures, but it 
is a unilateral decision of the United States, and the rest will 
have to be debated at the OAS. Of course, the OAS has changed a 
lot since Cuba was a member because it has reaffirmed the most 
important element of its identity; that is, democracy."

  [Text] Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo announced 
yesterday that the military naval fleet will be expanded to 
"guard our seas and coasts" from smugglers, pirates, and drug 
traffickers. 
  The announcement was made during a meeting with 
representatives of the fishing, business, labor, livestock, and 
transportation sectors, as well as the mayors of the Northern 
Atlantic Autonomous Region [RAAN]. During the meeting held at 
the National Technological Institute installations in Puerto 
Cabezas, Minister Lacayo responded to concerns voiced by 
representatives of the Moravian and Adventist Churches regarding 
the drug problem, which is affecting the area's population, 
especially youths. 
  Lacayo's decision triggered thunderous applause from 
attendees at the meeting, which was held following a private 
meeting between Lacayo and delegates of government institutions 
in the RAAN. 
  This meeting, which was closed by Governor Marcos Hoppenton, 
was followed by another meeting between Lacayo and 
representatives of all active sectors in the RAAN. 
  Not only did the mayors of Waspan, Bonanza, and Prinzapolka 
express the needs of their communities, but they also pointed 
out the achievements of the government of President Violeta 
Chamorro. 
  Reverend Cantol Taylor and Reverend Salomon Espinoza, 
representatives of the Moravian and the Adventist Churches, 
respectively, not only gave their blessings to the leaders of 
the country, but also recommended that unity, reconciliation, 
and love be promoted to help the country survive. Rev. Taylor 
also gave thanks for the good relations the Chamorro Government 
has promoted with his church. 
<H5>  The Challenges </H5>
  The representative of the Association of Indian Women, who 
spoke on behalf of some 4,000 organized women, also spoke at the 
meeting, which was attended by 350 delegates. 
  Meanwhile, Lacayo -- after listening to the concerns of the 
participants -- noted that the government likes challenges 
because they force it to redouble its efforts, thus allowing for 
changes to be made in Nicaragua. As for this last aspect, he 
mentioned the disarmament of armed groups; the transition from 
an authoritarian and autocratic government to one that respects 
constitutional and human rights; and the transition from a 
war-oriented to a development-oriented economy. Lacayo 
mentioned the return of many Nicaraguans -- many of whom were 
originally from the RAAN -- who were exiled to Honduras as one 
of the changes experienced since 1990. 
  Lacayo explained the reasons why the Enhanced Structural 
Adjustment Facility was signed with the IMF. He indicated that 
one of the reasons is to continue growing and to increase 
foreign investment in Nicaragua. He cited such specific cases 
as Taiwanese investment in the Intercontinental Hotel; Russian 
investment in geothermia; Swiss investment in NICALIT [expansion 
unknown]; and Honduran investment in the Sebaco Valley. 
<H5>  Road Improvement </H5>
  He stated that as a result of elections in the RAAN, 
representatives of the central government and the regional 
government, religious leaders, cooperative members, and mayors 
had been able to attend the meeting. He briefed attendants on 
the projects that are being implemented this year in various 
areas. He said that improvements are being made on the road 
that joins the Nicaraguan Atlantic and Pacific areas, and that 
funds are being increased for credit and grain collection 
purposes. The first allocation will be 12.7 million cordobas; 
5.4 million for the livestock sector; 3 million for the business 
sector; another 3 million for the fishing sector; and 300,000 
cordobas to reactivate silos to store basic grains. 
  Lacayo -- who was accompanied by several cabinet members -- 
announced that in 1994, 20 million cordobas will be allocated 
for works by the Emergency Fund for Social Investments [FISE], 
the Nicaraguan Institute of Municipal Development, and the 
Social Action Ministry. Only in the RAAN, the FISE-AID program 
will invest 18 million cordobas to build schools and health 
centers, and to buy desks. 
  Meanwhile, Education Minister Humberto Belli announced that 
the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg donated $1 million to build two 
teachers' schools, one in Bluefields and another in Puerto 
Cabezas. A visit by Prince William, son of the Grand Duke, is 
scheduled for the coming weeks.

  [Text] Paris, 17 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The international 
community and the world financial organizations today committed 
themselves to delivering $150 million to Nicaragua during the 
1994-95 period to consolidate the peace process and promote 
economic development. 
  The Advisory Group for Nicaragua said the two $75-million 
financial aid installments for 1994 and 1995 will be used to 
boost the economic development of that Central American nation. 
  At the conclusion of a two-day, closed-door meeting, 
Edilberto Segura, World Bank director for Mexico, Central 
America, and Panama, remarked on Nicaragua's democratic progress 
in 1993. 
  The donor countries asked the Nicaraguan Government to focus 
on fighting poverty, reducing the foreign debt, modernizing the 
public sector, and settling property disputes. 
  Mark Schneider, deputy director of the U.S. Agency for 
International Development's Latin American and Caribbean 
division, said: "The poorest of the poor must be the main 
beneficiaries of this financial aid." 
  The World Bank said the main challenge for Latin America "is 
to promote and sustain balanced growth while maintaining 
economic stability in view of possible reductions in 
international financial aid." 
  Nicaraguan Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo, who headed 
the 
Nicaraguan delegation, said "the only war we can wage now is a 
war on poverty," adding that "the armed conflict, 
totalitarianism, and backwardness must be left behind." 
  The government official asked the World Bank and the IMF to 
expedite their disbursements and increase their co-financing. 
Lacayo emphasized that it is necessary for them to provide $60 
million annually to increase funds to invest in rural 
production, especially small-scale production. 
  The Advisory Group meeting took place at the Paris World 
Bank 
quarters and was attended by delegates from Germany, Austria, 
Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, the Netherlands, Italy, Japan, 
Luxembourg, and Mexico. Representatives from Sweden, 
Switzerland, Spain, the United States, and Venezuela were also 
present, as were World Bank and IMF officials. 
  The Pan-American Health Organization, UNICEF, the OECD, and 
the International Agricultural Development Fund also attended 
the meeting.

  [Text] Immigration Department Director Antonio Dominguez 
said yesterday "400 Haitians who are in the country on tourist 
visas" will receive special treatment "when commercial flights" 
to that Caribbean island "are suspended." 
  Dominguez said Haitians who are in the national territory 
after 26 June--the date on which the suspension of commercial 
flights to Haiti begins--"will not be classified as political 
refugees" because they entered the country as tourists. 
  Dominguez asserted that among other mechanisms the 
Immigration Directorate may implement regarding the Haitians, 
"it is scheduling a charter flight to return the Haitians to 
Haiti" if the crisis in that former French colony is not 
resolved. 
  The Immigration Department director revealed that "Haitians 
wishing to enter Panama must have an authorized visa, which has 
been suspended for citizens of that Caribbean nation." 
  According to Dominguez, "visas are only being given to 
Haitians who reside in the United States to come to Panama for 
three days to purchase merchandise." 
  Finally, Immigration Director Antonio Dominguez remarked 
"this situation will affect Panamanian companies which do 
business with Haitians."

  [Text] The Panamanian Chamber of Commerce, Industries, and 
Agriculture is asking the Legislative Assembly to reject the 
copyright bill because it threatens the stability of companies 
and the media. 
  In a letter sent to the president of the Legislative 
Assembly, the Panamanian Chamber of Commerce asked for the 
rejection of the bill as approved in a first debate by the 
Education Committee, and it called for modifications presented 
by the Panamanian Broadcasting Association (APR) and the 
Panamanian Radio Chamber. The APR also sent a letter to the 
assembly's Board of Directors asking for a rejection of the 
copyright bill because it contains regulations that violate 
freedom of speech and threaten the economic stability of radio 
stations. Meanwhile, the Education Committee, which asked for 
the approval of the bill in its second and third debates, said 
the bill takes steps to protect all types of literary, artistic, 
and scientific works in light of the fact that author rights 
constitute the basic foundation for stimulating national 
creativity. The commission said another reason for endorsing the 
bill was Panama's current position in the international 
community, because Panama has signed a number of agreements 
requiring it to protect national works.

<F P=106> [Article by Euclides M. Corro R.] </F>
  [Text] Panama's credibility and good intentions in the 
fight against drug trafficking are being questioned 
internationally due to the indifference of the National 
Assembly, which for all practical purposes will be unable to 
hold a third debate on the reforms to Law no. 23 of the Penal 
Code. 
  Despite the efforts of the public prosecutor's office, the 
opinion held by U.S. agencies--that Panama is not complying with 
its international commitment against drug trafficking--is being 
justified. 
  Attorney General Jorge Ramon Valdes deplored the situation 
in 
a statement to LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA and he said that "one 
cannot fight against drug trafficking without the necessary 
legal instruments." 
  Valdes added that the skepticism--mainly on the part of the 
United States--concerning Panama's will to meet in earnest its 
commitments to various agencies throughout the world is 
understandable. 
  On 11 April, a bill to reform the law, which dates back to 
30 
December 1986, was submitted for a second debate. Among the 
reforms being considered is the creation of two prosecutor 
offices specializing in drug-related crimes. 
  The prosecutor offices will have authority and jurisdiction 
throughout Panama. The reforms also would permit the use of a 
legal framework for adequate procedures to be used in the fight 
against drug trafficking, such as undercover operations and drug 
exchange surveillance. 
  All indications are that with the end of the regular session 
of the legislative assembly only 15 days away, it will be almost 
impossible to discuss the bill, which would amend the current 
law to conform with the Vienna Convention. 
  We should mention this reform is the same one Panama 
presented before the OAS, the UN, and other agencies dedicated 
to the fight against drugs. 
  On 9 March, during the 15th ordinary session of the OAS 
Interamerican Commission for the Control and Against the Abuse 
of Drugs, which was held in Argentina, Attorney General Ramon 
Valdes, speaking on behalf of Panama, promised to take action in 
that respect.

<F P=106> [Statement by the Panamanian Banking Association outlining </F>
its position on money laundering; place and date not given] 
  [Text]Why We Should Struggle Against Money Laundering 
  Money is of vital importance for all legitimate trade and 
industrial activity, but it is even more important for criminal 
activity. The constant flow of illegally obtained money through 
the international banking and financial systems is fundamental 
for criminal organizations as a means of obtaining funds 
necessary for financing their operations and providing new 
capital for their expansion. Therefore, the interruption of the 
flow of money to criminal organizations is of utmost importance 
in weakening and eventually eradicating them. The illegal and 
criminal nature of money laundering is the main reason why the 
Republic of Panama, its government, and its people should 
decidedly combat money laundering. In addition, an analysis of 
the methods through which criminal organizations gradually take 
over a nation's economy shows that this struggle is an urgent 
necessity in safeguarding the future of our nation. 
  This is the danger that looms over Panama and how it could 
occur: 
  1. Infiltration in legitimate companies. Criminals 
and drug traffickers, in particular, manage their businesses as 
large corporations. The only difference between these illegal 
operations and legitimate ones is that the illegal operations 
have an enormous competitive advantage: They do not obey any 
law. This advantage, in addition to their international contacts 
and vast financial and coercive power, allows them to acquire 
legitimate companies which are then used to conceal illegal 
operations. In this way, they gradually infiltrate every sector 
of the economy. 
  2. Concentration of economic power. The gradual 
subjection of legitimate companies in key sectors of the 
economy, along with the great amount of illegally earned capital 
that can be used to expand illicit operations, creates a 
concentration of economic power that subsequently can spill into 
other investments and economic sectors. Eventually, these might 
infiltrate political and government circles, and this would have 
serious implications for the nation's future security and its 
political and moral stability. 
  3. Money laundering as an ill-fated function in the 
economy. The final stage of money laundering is reached 
when illegally earned capital replaces domestic and foreign 
investment in funding economic expansion. At the same time, this 
surreptitiously harms the very foundations of the banking 
sector, the stock exchange, and the financial system. The risk 
of this happening is especially high in an economy such as 
Panama's--one that lacks resources and, in turn, is eager for 
investments. 
<H5>  Corporations, Money, the Banking System, and the Free Zone: </H5>
  Given its geographic location and the configuration and 
extension of its territory, Panama has historically been a 
center of trade and transit. Although growth can be obtained in 
other areas, it is unlikely that Panama will turn into an 
agricultural, mining, or manufacturing power. Our greatest 
development potential in the immediate future seems to be in the 
sustained growth of maritime and tourism services while 
maintaining a healthy monetary infrastructure in banking and 
international trade. As a result, services have been identified 
as our best natural means of encouraging the nation's economic 
growth. 
  Our service economy is based on our geographic location and 
the Panama Canal. In addition to this, Panama features four 
areas that are essential for today's service economy but, at the 
same time, are also threatened in various ways: 
  -- the Law on Corporations, which was approved in 1927; 
  -- the monetary system, which dates back to 1904; 
  -- the banking system, which was created in 1970; 
  -- and the Colon Free Zone, which was organized in 1946. 
  The threats facing these four areas of our service economy 
stem from two sources: 
  -- from some sectors of the international community aimed 
at limiting their effectiveness and ending their existence; 
  -- attempts by criminal organizations to use these areas 
to benefit their illegal activities. 
  It is obvious that Panama did not create these institutions 
to have them used for criminal activities. This is why Panama 
has the obligation to improve, control more efficiently, and 
finally defend these institutions to enable them to continue 
being useful for honest businessmen in an economy that is 
fundamentally service-based and whose structure will not change 
dramatically for a long time. 
<H5>  Evaluation of Achievements </H5>
  Drug traffickers and other criminal organizations use 
incredibly advanced techniques and employ professionals with 
broad knowledge of banking and financial affairs, with access to 
the latest technologies of electronic banking and instant 
communications to conduct operations beyond national borders. 
Therefore, international cooperation is imperative to prepare 
and coordinate measures that will make possible an effective 
struggle against money laundering. 
  As part of these efforts, the 1989 Economic Summit created 
the Financial Action Task Force, better known by its English 
acronym FATF, formed originally by 26 countries that are sites 
of financial centers. Panama subsequently joined it as a member 
of the Caribbean subgroup. In May 1990, the FATF adopted 40 
recommendations on measures to counter money laundering, based 
on the 1988 Vienna Convention. Fulfillment or adoption of these 
40 recommendations currently constitutes the best means to 
evaluate progress in these struggles, and, in fact, in April 
1991 the member countries agreed that their comparative progress 
in this regard will be evaluated by experts from the group. In 
Panama's case, an objective evaluation reviewing these 
recommendations and other facts would reveal the following: 
  1. Panama ratified the Vienna Convention in December 1993 
and 
is in the process of implementing those articles that are not 
included in Panamanian legislation. (Recommendation No. 1).. 
  2. Panama's banking confidentiality laws do not involve 
absolute secrecy as it is made to appear to locals and 
foreigners. Panamanian laws unquestionably permit authorities 
access to confidential information through the proper judicial 
institutions in the presence of suspicious criminal activity. 
(Recommendation No. 2) 
  3. Panama accepts international assistance and coordination 
against criminal activities, as can be confirmed by the recent 
mutual legal assistance treaties negotiated with the United 
Kingdom, Colombia, Canada, and Central America and the initial 
negotiations with Mexico. In July 1991, Panama ratified a 
similar treaty with the United States, which has yet to ratify 
it. (Recommendation No. 3) 
  4. Through Law No. 23 of 1986, Panama defined as a crime the 
improper use of banking transactions. In addition to the 
criminal liability that this crime entails, Law No. 23 also 
establishes the civil liability of the individual or his 
employer. In addition to the transactions made in Panama, this 
definition also includes those originating in Panama and 
perfected abroad, with knowledge, through an individual or 
intervening person. Finally, Law No. 23 and its reforms will 
permit the seizure and confiscation of assets or instruments 
related to the criminal action. (Recommendations Nos. 4 and 5) 
  5. There is no official agency with sufficient authority and 
responsibility to define, coordinate, and implement actions 
against money laundering. The vacuum caused by the absence of 
such an agency cannot currently be filled by the National 
Banking Commission because of legal, technical, and budgetary 
limitations. This constitutes one of the most serious 
limitations Panama has in the struggle against laundering. 
(Recommendations Nos. 9-11) 
  6. Cabinet Decree No. 41 of February 1990 establishes as an 
obligation the identification of the client and registration of 
transactions in cash and negotiable instruments. This decree is 
the source of authority that permitted the National Banking 
Commission to issue Resolutions Nos. 5-90 and 1-91 regulating 
the banks' obligation to know their clients and maintain a 
registry of transactions in cash and negotiable payment 
instruments. Unfortunately, the National Banking Commission does 
not have the resources to create an automatized database to 
adequately handle this information. (Recommendations Nos. 12-14) 
  7. Decree No. 41 and the relevant resolutions do not 
explicitly address the problem of complex or uncommon 
transactions or the topic of patterns or trends of infrequent or 
unusual transactions. Decree No. 41 also does not address the 
banks' responsibility to investigate these types of transactions 
to establish their origin or purpose. (Recommendation No. 15) 
  8. Regarding dubious transactions, the Penal Code 
stipulates that banks and their employees are required to tell 
the relevant authorities about them under penalty of harboring 
criminal activities. However, there is no legal precedent in 
Panamanian courts that protects the institution or its employees 
from civil or criminal responsibility for violating banking 
secrecy laws in these cases. In addition, in terms of suspicious 
activities, no law requires that banks terminate their relation 
with the client. Finally, no legal precept requires banks to 
implement procedures including controls, screening procedures, 
policies, and training and internal audit programs against money 
laundering. This lack of clear guidelines on the policies banks 
should adopt to prevent domestic or international money 
laundering curtails the confidence with which banks can act 
regarding compliance with their legal obligations against money 
laundering. (Recommendation Nos. 16-22) 
  9. Panama has implemented additional measures to avert money 
laundering, including the cash transactions declaration and the 
internal promotion of alternative forms of payment such as 
checks, credit cards, direct deposits of salaries, and other 
transactions that replace the use of cash. However, although 
Decree 41 requires that transactions larger than $10,000 must be 
registered, it does not include electronic international 
transfers, nor does it require the creation of a national data 
bank operating under a separate government agency that 
guarantees its proper use. (Recommendation Nos. 23-25) 
  10. Panama has not sufficiently strengthened the role of the 
National Banking Commission as a coordinating organization to 
prevent and investigate money laundering since the National 
Banking Commission does not extend its controls to other 
institutions that manage considerable amounts of money such as 
casinos, money-changing offices, and transfer agencies. The 
National Banking Commission lacks the resources and the 
authority to introduce, in all banks, adequate programs to 
prevent money laundering or measures to detect any suspicious 
behavior by clients. The National Banking Commission does have 
and does exercise the authority to prevent criminal parties from 
owning a majority of stocks in banking institutions. 
(Recommendation Nos. 26-29) 
  11. As for the strengthening of international cooperation 
efforts against money laundering, Panama has showed willingness 
to participate at both the bilateral and multilateral levels 
within its current legal parameters and financial limitations. 
The exchange of general information by relevant authorities, 
except areas related to dubious transactions, cooperation 
between judicial and legal authorities, and mutual assistance in 
investigations through the corresponding legal and diplomatic 
means, should improve as bilateral agreements come into force. 
(Recommendation Nos. 30-40) 
  As part of an objective evaluation, actions by the Panama 
Banking Association that reinforce or complement achievements by 
the national government should not be downplayed. A brief list 
of these actions reveals that this Banking Association adopted 
in 1984, through an interbanking agreement, the Code of Conduct 
on Banking Operations, which was reformed in 1985 and 1986; 
joined in 1989 the Declaration of Principles of the 
International Bank for Clearing House Activities in Basel, 
Switzerland; prepared in 1992 and updated in 1993 a guideline 
for banks to prevent the improper use of their services; 
conducted in 1992 and 1993 training and information seminars on 
preventing money laundering jointly with authorities of the 
Treasury Department, Justice Department, DEA [Drug Enforcement 
Administraiton], Financial Crime Enforcement Network, and U.S. 
Postal Service; conducted jointly with the National Banking 
Commission in 1992 and 1993 a study to establish, as was done, 
consistency between the information on cashflows and the 
remittances of excess cash to the U.S. Federal Reserve; adopted 
in March 1993 Interbanking Agreement No. 28, which determines 
the order of endorsements on checks and facilitates audits 
thereof; adopted in June 1993 Interbanking Agreement No. 29, 
which regulates the acceptance of alternate documents for 
negotiable payment and the criteria to send and receive 
remittances of bank transfers. 

<H5>    Recommendations </H5>
  Additional measures that the Panamanian public sector as 
well 
as the private sector should take to combat money laundering 
must result from Panamanian analysis--an analysis that must take 
place within the domestic arena, while maintaining cooperation 
with other nations. This analysis should focus on what is needed 
to help us wage an efficient struggle against money laundering. 
This analysis should also result from our philosophical 
conviction that this struggle is ethical, moral, and 
economically prudent for Panama. 
  In terms of its internal policies, the Panama Banking 
Association proposes: 
  1. to bring up to date its Code of Conduct on Banking 
Operations; 
  2. to improve, wherever possible, the "Guide for Banks To 
Prevent the Misuse of Services" [Guia a los Bancos Para Prevenir 
el Uso Indebido de Sus Servicios]; 
  3. to defend our customers' rights to confidentiality in 
legitimate business transactions, as provided for under our 
legislation; 
  4. and to combat the abuse of confidentially by 
organizations or individuals devoted to criminal activity. 
  The Panama Banking Association recommends to Panama's 
executive, legislative, and judicial powers: 
  1. The creation of a working group with a mandate to 
design a national policy against money laundering; this working 
group should comprise representatives of the Attorney General's 
Office, the National Banking Commission, and the Legislative 
Assembly's Drug Commission. 
  2. The endowing of the National Banking Commission with 
the technical, legal, and budgetary resources to carry out the 
integration, execution, and coordination of a national policy to 
prevent money laundering. 
  3. The prompt issuance of legal documents to implement the 
guidelines of the Vienna Convention and the FATF with regard to 
the banks' obligation to: 
  3.1. register all international and local transactions in 
a logbook subject to revision by the Banking Commission; 
  3.2. rigorously investigate the origin and destination of 
intricate and unusual transactions; 
  3.3. report to the authorities suspicious transactions, 
safeguarding civil obligations concerning confidentiality; 
  3.4. implement in bank procedures and policies to prevent 
money laundering, training programs that impart to employees a 
thorough knowledge of internal auditing procedures, and programs 
to guarantee the fulfillment of these procedures; this duty 
would fall under the auspices of a high-ranking officer 
specifically designated to carry out these tasks; 
  3.5. register stock market transactions or securities 
deals that are unusual or suspicious in nature, subjecting them 
to revision by the Banking Commission. 
  4. The inclusion within the authority of the Banking 
Commission additional powers to prevent money laundering; the 
power to review the flow of funds from casinos, exchange houses, 
and money transfer agencies; and the power to enforce the 
obligation of these institutions to report such cashflows to the 
National Banking Commission. 
  5. The creation, as soon as possible, of an official data 
bank under the Banking Commission's control and administration 
to secure, compare, and analyze the information outlined in 
Cabinet Decree 41 of 13 February 1990 and Cabinet Decree 10 of 9 
March 1994. This includes any other information--to be furnished 
upon request--regarding cash transactions, negotiable documents, 
securities, or transfers made through electronic or magnetic 
media. 
  6. An agreement on the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty 
[MLAT] to strengthen and broaden Panama's participation in the 
struggle against money laundering and the speedy ratification of 
the MLAT by the relevant institutions. 
  7. The adoption of a doctrine or a group of principles 
that oppose money laundering and emphasize systematic, 
continuous, and dynamic preventative action instead of focusing 
on how best to deal with crimes already committed. In addition, 
such a doctrine should protect our irreplaceable service economy 
and Panama's good name and image. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  In conclusion, the Banking Association wants to acknowledge 
that in Panama, as well as in many other friendly nations, the 
problem of money laundering is a reality. In addition, it wants 
to signal that the problem of money laundering is constantly 
changing and remains extremely dynamic in terms of criminal 
creativity and resources available to criminals who constantly 
modify and invent new money laundering techniques, thereby 
making current preventive actions ineffective. The struggle 
against money laundering requires constant surveillance, quick 
action, and close international coordination and cooperation to 
remain in step with the criminals and to avoid losing the 
battle. Above all else, the struggle requires knowledge, 
commitment, and the willingness of the state and all national 
sectors to achieve final victory.

  [Text] Santiago del Estero (DYN) -- Eleven former members 
of Peru's Shining Path organization reportedly entered Argentina 
illegally and are traveling to Buenos Aires to file for 
residency as refugees. 
  The group's spokesman, Jorge Diaz Reategui, said that after 
defecting from the Maoist guerrilla organization, the 11 wended 
their way south with the assistance of international agencies 
including the United Nations. 
  "First we went to Ecuador and later Brazil and Colombia," 
said Diaz Reategui, "but those countries did not agree to accept 
us as refugees." 
  Diaz Reategui said he was a fighter with the group, known as 
Sendero Luminoso in Spanish, but had only participated in three 
conflicts. 
  The spokesman said the UN was supporting the former senderos 
in Argentina. He added that he had been detained by police in 
Tucuman for 10 days.

  [Excerpt] The rumors spread during the past few days 
referring to alleged negotiations between the MNR [Nationalist 
Revolutionary Movement] and the MIR [Movement of the 
Revolutionary Left] were denied by the two parties' 
representatives, although with different arguments. 
  Communications Minister Ernesto Machicado, MIR Senator 
Gonzalo Valda, and MIR Deputy Hugo Carvajal said the version of 
the alleged agreement between the two parties, supposedly to 
"tone down" the report on "narcolinks" in exchange for support 
to sentence the Supreme Court justices, were mere rumors. 
  Carvajal believes the rumors spread by some MNR groups seek 
to discredit Constitutional Committee Chairman Edil Sandoval to 
force him and other deputies to act "aggressively" against the 
MIR. 
  Carvajal added: "An effort is being made for the purpose of 
demonstrating the existence of alleged negotiations, probably 
due to disagreements among some MNR groups that seek to 
discredit and disqualify the performance of Edil Sandoval, 
probably to prevent him from continuing to behave as objectively 
as he has done so far." 
  Carvajal said he believed that these rumors influence the 
rest of the committee members to act against the MIR to avoid 
speculation regarding the alleged negotiations. 
  The MIR deputy regretted the spreading of rumors on the 
performance of MIR senators in the impeachment process who, he 
asserted, "have conscientiously acknowledged the deputies' 
decision." 
  According to Carvajal, the MIR senators will vote according 
to their consciences "and nobody will be able to influence 
them." [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Santa Cruz Chamber of Private Communications 
Media sent a letter to Telecommunications Director General Raul 
Campero Paz in which it regrets the proliferation of clandestine 
radios in this department despite the expressed commitment of 
the director general, who on 18 May conveyed his decision to use 
"all legal and technical means to prevent the emergence of new 
stations disregarding the requirements that rule the national 
broadcasting system." 
  Enrique Roda Bush, chairman of the private communications 
media, referred to the creation and opening of radio "Amazonas 
107.9 MHZ," which is already on the air in Santa Cruz. This 
proves that officials in the area have been overpowered in their 
effort to put an end to the operation of clandestine stations. 
  He demanded an order that should work to fulfill the law's 
provisions. Campero Paz two weeks ago said he would personally 
order the DITER [expansion unknown] regional agent to prevent 
broadcasting by Radio Creativa, which did not have anything, not 
even a copy of the license application request form. 
  He then reaffirmed his commitment to act in all cases that 
could emerge concerning radios that have not complied with the 
technical and legal reorganization of the radio broadcasting 
system.

  [Excerpts] Inter-American Development Bank [IDB] President 
Enrique Iglesias yesterday said that over the next four years, 
Brazil will receive financial resources worth $5 billion. The 
announcement was made after a meeting with Planning Minister 
Beni Veras, with whom he discussed a timetable for releasing 
financial resources in 1994 and in 1995. 
  No priority project for the 1996/97 period was selected at 
yesterday's meeting. According to Iglesias, the Franco 
government preferred to leave the decision in the hands of the 
next administration, which will take power in January. [passage 
omitted] 
  Iglesias said the lack of Brazilian matching funds for the 
projects has caused no difficulties between the IDB and the 
federal government. According to Agencia Brasil, Iglesias and 
Planning Minister Beni Veras said that the only difficulties 
have to do with project management. 
  Iglesias said that projects worth $1.2 billion should be 
approved this year. This figure is higher than the $1 billion 
mark the government was expecting for this period. "This shows 
our confidence in the country," Iglesias said, praising the fact 
that the Real Plan was preceded by fiscal control measures. Says 
an IDB source: "They [not further identified] do not know much 
about the plan, but they have great expectations about 
stabilization; and wherever Brazil goes, Latin America will go." 
  Projects amounting to $1.4 billion are listed for 1995. 
Iglesias said that it is their intention to earmark 50 percent 
of these resources for social undertakings including improved 
health, sanitation, education, transportation, and 
infrastructure facilities. There are, however, other projects 
intended for strengthening the institutions such as one 
concerning the restructuring of the Federal Revenue Secretariat, 
which is expected to receive between $78 million and $80 million 
in 1995. 
  Iglesias also announced that the IDB will donate $20 million 
for projects involving assistance to street children in six 
cities: Sao Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Porto Alegre, Teresina, 
Salvador, and Recife. The money will be handed over to 
nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) operating in those cities. 
The donation will be approved by the IDB "board" on 29 June. He 
said: "This will be a pioneer project in Latin America and shows 
the direction the IDB is taking." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Francisca Stella Faga datelined Sao Paulo] </F>
  [Text] The Brazilian Government has already spent more than 
$1 million preparing projects for the Amazon region to be 
financed under a pilot program of the G-7 countries--the seven 
most developed countries in the world. Yet, the Rain Forest 
Trust Fund, which is administered by the World Bank, has not to 
date disbursed a single cent from the $1.5 billion promised by 
the G-7 in 1990. 
  This was one of the many examples cited yesterday in Sao 
Paulo by Sergio Amaral, chief of the Finance Ministry staff, who 
until recently served as the Environment Ministry's main 
coordinator of negotiations for financing environmental projects. 
  Amaral believes the long list of failures to use the 
resources committed by organizations like the World Bank and the 
G-7 shows "Brazil is perhaps not fully capable of taking 
advantage of the opportunities created in this field, which 
today ranks high on the international agenda," despite the fact 
it has "turned the pressure exerted against us into a political 
victory." 
  Commenting on the Amazon Pilot Program, Amaral noted that 
the 
problem does not lie only in the delay in disbursing the 
resources donated to the Brazilian Government, but in the fact 
that G-7 member countries have suspended their bilateral 
cooperation because they were already committed to the 
multilateral program. Brazil thus lost cooperation at bilateral 
level without being compensated through disbursements from the 
above fund. He said the World Bank has spent $500,000 from the 
trust fund in financing missions and in disseminating 
information on a program that still remains on paper. 
  The General Environment Facility (GEF)--which has been 
administered by the World Bank since 1990 and which finances 
projects to avoid global warming and to preserve biodiversity, 
international waters, and the ozone layer--should be another 
major source of resources. The GEF had $1.2 billion. It 
allocated $30 million to Brazil in 1991. During a lecture at the 
Institute for Advanced Studies at the University of Sao Paulo, 
Amaral noted that Brazil had submitted seven projects in 1993, 
but nothing has yet been disbursed. 
  No private donations have come to Brazil through the debt 
conversion mechanism, Amaral added. He noted that more than $80 
million was rapidly obtained in Bolivia in this way. Brazil was 
slow in making this operation feasible and its legislation was 
inadequate, and so the value of debt bonds rose and nothing 
happened, he said. 
  Amaral cited as another failure the case of the National 
Environment Program (PNMA), which was created in 1990. Three 
years later, in December 1993, the PNMA had disbursed only $20.5 
million of the $117 million promised by the World Bank. 
  Amaral blames these poor results largely on the way 
Brazilian 
political instability, the fiscal crisis, and inflation have 
affected international cooperation. Brazil has been unable to 
use many loans granted under advantageous conditions because the 
Treasury has not authorized the respective matching funds. 
  Amaral also charged that Brazilian Government organizations 
were not prepared to negotiate and absorb the volume of foreign 
resources that become available since the mid-1980's. 
  IBAMA [Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable 
Natural Resources], which was created in 1989, has experienced a 
high managerial turnover: It had nine presidents in just four 
years. The Environment Secretariat, which later became the 
Environment Ministry, has had six different heads since 1992. 
IBAMA has not had trained teams either. 
  Amaral noted there has been poor planning, overambitious 
managers with unrealistic goals, imprecise projects, unrealistic 
deadlines, and extremely complex bureaucratic paperwork. One 
project involving environmental management and technology that 
would have received $25 million had to be discontinued because 
it was not possible to clearly define its objective. 
  Amaral believes the Brazilian Government was not the only 
one 
that made mistakes. He said: "The World Bank's technical teams 
markedly increased their demands, were counterproductive, and 
unduly interfered with the planning and implementation of 
projects." 
  He noted that in the case of the PNMA, the IBAMA director 
for 
ecosystems had to prepare seven different versions of an annual 
operations plan for conservation units to meet the World Bank's 
successive demands. 
  This delayed the program and discouraged the Ibama experts' 
team. To avoid canceling the bidding that those who were 
coordinating the program had prepared together with the World 
Bank, a manual on documents and standard procedures for the 
biddings was approved by the bank after several months of 
discussion. When tested for the first time in an international 
bidding for the purchase of informatics equipment, however, the 
procedures were rejected by the World Bank. To everyone's 
surprise, the bank preferred INCRA [National Land Reform and 
Settlement Institute] procedures. 
  Amaral said the experiment with the Pilot Program for the 
Amazon Region is even more frustrating. The World Bank, which is 
used to large projects, has been having difficulties in 
organizing small projects with the participation of the local 
people. Just as the negotiations are about to be concluded, new 
demands are frequently made and guidances modified during the 
negotiation process. 
  In a meeting held at the end of March in Brussels to 
evaluate 
the Pilot Program for the Amazon Region, the Brazilian 
Government did its best to show how these issues harmed the 
decisionmaking process. The World Bank reaction was positive, 
admitting that procedures should be expedited.

  [Text] Sao Jose dos Campos -- In Sao Jose dos Campos on 14 
June, Sao Paulo Deic [Criminal Investigations Department] police 
arrested lawyer Geraldo Magela Gontijo, who was carrying 
counterfeit dollar bills worth $2.05 million. The bills, found 
in two bags at the lawyer's office, were printed in Ribeirao 
Preto. Police caught the lawyer after arresting print worker 
Ademir Ambrosio in Sao Miguel Paulista (Sao Paulo). Ambrosio 
confessed to the crime and revealed the place where some of the 
bills--of an $8 million order that was being printed--had been 
left. 
  Police were investigating the links between Gontijo and 
Ambrosio, who were interrogated early in the morning. Despite 
being caught red-handed, the lawyer denied the charges and said 
he was not the bills' owner. He is being held at the county 
prison. According to Ambrosio, the counterfeiting began four 
months ago. He was to have received 5 percent of the total. The 
bills, all $100 bills, were not finished.

<F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Foreign Affairs Celso Luis Nunes </F>
Amorim by Nely Caixeta, during the first week of May 1994; place 
not given: "Market for Our Products Has Grown"] 
  [Text]Ambassador Celso Luis Nunes Amorim took over 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 10 months ago at a crucial 
moment for any diplomat in a similar post. After nearly eight 
years of protracted talks involving more than 100 countries, the 
Uruguay Round--as the GATT negotiations were called--had finally 
ended. In the middle of last month, Amorim, 52, who is a native 
of Santos, Sao Paulo, a former president of Embrafilme 
[Brazilian Film Company], and a former head of Brazil's 
delegation to Geneva, put his signature on the concluding 
agreements of the Uruguay Round and the new World Trade 
Organization. The ceremony, which was held in Marrakech, 
Morocco, will have a guaranteed place in history if the 
liberalization of trade called for in the new order succeeds in 
achieving the promised revolution--a growth in world trade that 
may reach $700 billion per year. In Amorim's opinion, the new 
business opportunities for Brazil are exceptional. Regarded in 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a firm negotiator, Amorim is 
alert to other challenges. A little over two months ago, for 
example, he put his capabilities to the test when he was able at 
the last minute to ward off trade sanctions that the United 
States was threatening to impose as a protest against the delay 
in approving the new Industrial Property Law. Last week he 
granted the following interview to EXAME. 
  [Caixeta] What is Brazil gaining from the GATT Uruguay Round 
agreement? 
  [Amorim] The most tangible impact will be an increase in 
exports as a result of two factors: the opening up of the world 
market and the establishment of more stable rules for 
international trade. Estimates of that impact vary considerably. 
Forecasts indicate that world trade will grow by between $250 
billion and $700 billion per year. Obviously, that impact will 
not be immediate because some of the measures agreed on in the 
Uruguay Round will not take effect until 10 years from now. 
Assuming that Brazil retains its current share of international 
trade (slightly less than one percent of the total), it can be 
expected that our exports will rise by between $2.5 billion and 
$7 billion per year. 
  [Caixeta] Some people consider those estimates too timid. 
  [Amorim] That additional $2.5 billion in our annual exports 
does in fact represent a conservative estimate. There are also 
the secondary effects that the liberalization of trade is going 
to have on economic growth itself. These estimates do not take 
into account the fact that we now have more stable rules for 
trade. Last year, for example, Brazil was in danger of losing 
from $200 million to $300 million because of antidumping 
measures applied by the United States to Brazilian steel 
exports. We did not lose that full amount because some of the 
measures in question were never implemented, but our steel 
exports were delayed. Stable rules are a basic factor as far as 
the firms are concerned, because when exporting their products, 
they must follow some kind of planning. It is not that 
antidumping measures are going to disappear beginning now. They 
will diminish, however, and we will be more certain of being 
able to take our complaints to the World Trade Organization, 
which replaces GATT. This means that we will be treated more 
appropriately. 
  [Caixeta] Which sectors of the Brazilian economy will 
probably be the first to benefit from the new rules on 
international trade? 
  [Amorim] The developed countries are supposed to lower their 
tariffs by an average of 38 percent. Brazil has a very 
diversified economy. It exports everything from relatively 
simple products to computer software. Barriers will also be 
eliminated in three sectors that are very important to us: 
agriculture, textiles, and steel. In the case of agriculture, 
the complicated import rules imposed by the European Union will 
be gradually eliminated over a six-year period. The same thing 
will happen in the case of textiles over a 10-year period. Also 
to be eliminated is the quota system based on so-called 
voluntary restriction agreements. In Brazil's case, that system 
affected steel in particular. 
  [Caixeta] What impact will the reduction of export 
subsidies--especially in the agricultural area--have on 
Brazilian producers? 
  [Amorim] As far as Brazil is concerned, this is very 
important. We are losing sales in several traditional 
markets--the Near East, Asia, and East Europe--because of the 
farm subsidies paid by the European Union and the United States. 
One side used to justify its own subsidies on the grounds of 
those paid by the other. Over a six-year period, the total value 
of those subsidies will be reduced by 36 percent. That is not 
much, but it is a start. 
  [Caixeta] Including the service sector in the Uruguay Round 
was not well received by the Brazilian Government when the talks 
began back in 1986. What is the government's current assessment 
of that aspect of the agreement? 
  [Amorim] It is true that the liberalization of trade in 
services frightened us at first. There was concern over 
competition from the developed countries. But Brazilian firms 
offer very efficient services in certain fields. Engineering 
services are one example. Bank automation is another. Today we 
even export software. Moreover, I was surprised to learn that 
Brazil is in a good position to export attorney services and 
legal consulting services. 
  [Caixeta] How do you view the pressure that the rich 
countries are beginning to put on the developing countries in 
connection with what they call social dumping--that is, their 
threat to set up barriers against countries where wages are low? 
  [Amorim] That is a new protectionist threat by the developed 
countries. At a time when markets are beginning to open up, we 
are seeing the emergence of this new issue, which can be used as 
a protectionist barrier. Incidentally, the environment issue may 
also be used that way. This does not mean that those issues in 
themselves are not legitimate. They must be debated. The doubt I 
have, especially on the labor issue, is whether it is right to 
tie the issue of low wages to trade. I can give you an example. 
I was in Marrakech, Morocco, for the signing of the Uruguay 
Round agreement. It is a very beautiful city of medieval origin, 
and today it is a big tourist center. All one had to do was 
leave the hotel and go downtown to see minors working. What 
might they be doing if they were not working? Would they be 
attending school, begging for handouts, or doing something 
worse? Obviously, no one can be in favor of the exploitation of 
manpower, but matters that must be resolved in Brazil in a 
sovereign manner cannot be left in the hands of foreign 
protectionist interests. 
  [Caixeta] Have you been discussing these matters with the 
labor unions? 
  [Amorim] I have been talking to the president of the CUT 
[Sole Workers Center], Jair Meneguelli. There have been contacts 
with other central unions, and they have also expressed their 
views on the matter. Unions in Brazil are free. They fully 
protect the interests of the workers. Brazil is a country where 
there are strikes even in the Budget Department. I lived in 
developed countries for years and never saw anything like that. 
It is through union freedom and freer trade abroad that our 
social conditions will improve, not as a result of sanctions 
imposed by other countries. I want to sponsor a seminar where 
that topic will be debated with the workers, people in 
government and other interested sectors, and the academic world. 
We have seen many noble causes being used as a pretext for 
protectionist measures. We cannot leave it up to an orange juice 
producer in the United States to decide in the future whether 
the manpower used by the juice industry in Brazil is well paid 
or poorly paid. If action is taken on the grounds of some 
alleged social dumping, regardless of whether it affects 
Brazilian footwear, steel, or orange juice, the effect will be 
higher unemployment in those areas. 
  [Caixeta] When you arrived in the United States to discuss 
the issue of patents, there were only a few days left before the 
introduction of trade reprisals against Brazil. How did you 
manage to reverse that situation? 
  [Amorim] I spoke frankly. That is the main thing if you want 
to win people's confidence. It is essential not to try to 
conceal, deceive, or promise things that are impossible. In that 
way we were able to lay a few ghosts to rest. The issue of 
intellectual property has developed into an emotion-filled 
subject over the course of many years. There were already scars 
in Brazil because of retaliatory measures and sanctions imposed 
by the United States. But basically, reality today is not what 
it was when the discussion began. Today we have the GATT 
agreement. The Americans were previously in the habit of talking 
about legislation on a worldwide scale. But what did that mean? 
There were no parameters. Simple compliance with the Uruguay 
Round agreement would be enough to solve 95 percent of the 
problems. 
  [Caixeta] The Brazilian Government is proposing the 
establishment of a free trade area in South America. What 
benefits will that bring us in addition to those we already have 
in our relations with ALADI [Latin American Integration 
Association]? 
  [Amorim] ALADI is an agreement whose long-range objective is 
to create a common market in Latin America. But in concrete 
terms, it functions only as an umbrella organization for 
fostering sectoral agreements. So far, ALADI has resulted in 
limited negotiations. There are agreements on a certain number 
of products, but most products are not covered. 
  [Caixeta] Then what is the objective as far as the free 
trade 
area in South America is concerned? 
  [Amorim] What we want in South America, based on our 
experience with Mercosur [Common Market of the South], is a more 
extensive liberalization of all tariffs and nontariff barriers 
over a period of 10 years. We want to reverse the situation that 
exists today. The fact is that we negotiate only 20 percent of 
the tariff schedule. Everything else is considered exempt. We 
must protect only what is absolutely sensitive. The South 
American countries belonging to ALADI--excluding those belonging 
to Mercosur--now account for about 8 percent of our export 
market. It can be said that that is not much, but the picture 
changes when you consider that 80 percent of what we export to 
those countries consists of manufactured goods, unlike what we 
export to the developed countries. 
  [Caixeta] What is your assessment of the criticism directed 
at the implementation of Mercosur? Is it not true that the 
objectives of commercial integration as expressed in the 
Asuncion Treaty were too ambitious or unrealistic, as some 
people claim? 
  [Amorim] We have already benefited noticeably from the 
integration process. Trade with the three Mercosur countries 
today accounts for 13 percent of our exports. Before the 
Asuncion Treaty eight years ago, it amounted to only 4.5 
percent. There has been breathtaking growth. But if you take all 
the objectives of the Asuncion Treaty literally, it is true that 
they have not been fully achieved. 
  [Caixeta] A few weeks ago, President Itamar Franco sent a 
letter to the presidents of the Mercosur countries explaining 
the Brazilian position on NAFTA. What did that letter say? 
  [Amorim] We said that Brazil took a positive view of NAFTA 
and that we would be ready to talk as a group--all four 
countries--whenever invited. The letter had two main objectives. 
First, to dissipate doubts about Brazil's interest in the 
matter. Yes, we are interested in participating in NAFTA when we 
are invited to do so. Second, Brazil wants to negotiate together 
with its Mercosur partners. But the United States, Mexico, and 
Canada are still digesting NAFTA and the Uruguay Round itself. 
It will do no good for us to stand there knocking on the door 
when we know that they are not ready to open it. 
  [Caixeta] Is it not possible that behind the establishment 
of 
that free trade zone in South America is a strategic motive--in 
other words, a desire to increase the region's bargaining power 
when and if the invitation comes to discuss integration with 
NAFTA? 
  [Amorim] That might in fact happen as a consequence. But the 
objective is not to form a bloc. It is obvious that by opening 
up their markets to each other, the economies in the region will 
grow stronger. And that, obviously, will help in any other 
international negotiation.

  [Text] Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa stated that 
if Cuba sticks to its decision to not allow any political 
refugees out of the island, Chile will have to review the 
negotiations currently under way with that country to solve the 
problem. 
  Figueroa thus referred to the hardening of the Cuban stance 
regarding eight Cuban citizens who remain in the Chilean 
Consulate in Havana. According to press reports, Fidel Castro's 
government has stated that it will never authorize the people 
who occupy foreign embassies by force to leave the country, even 
if they decide to abandon them voluntarily. 
  Figueroa said that a communique in this sense represents a 
change of Castro's original offer to grant the refugees exit 
visas. Figueroa also reasserted the Chilean Government's 
decision to continue giving them protection for humanitarian 
reasons and to see that no reprisals are adopted against them if 
the eight Cubans decide to voluntarily leave the consulate. 
  In Havana, in addition to the eight Cubans who have sought 
asylum at the Chilean Consulate, there are another 107 in the 
Belgium Embassy and 21 in the German Embassy.

  [Text] Quito, 20 Jun (AFP) -- The social and political 
agitation by Ecuadoran Indians, which has kept the country in 
upheaval in the past eight days, worsened in the last few hours 
with violent incidents that reportedly led to the death of four 
Indians from the Andean Province of Canar, south of Quito. 
  Organized by the Confederation of Indian Nationalities of 
Ecuador (Conaie), which includes most of the Indian groups, the 
Indians are strictly carrying out a "great protest mobilization 
for life" to demand the repeal of a new agrarian law approved by 
the Executive and Legislative Branches. The Indians charge that 
the law is unconstitutional. 
  A source from the organization told AFP today that on 
Thursday the Indians of the Amazon region began taking control 
of the facilities for four petroleum wells managed by the Elf 
Hydrocarbures company of France and the Ecuadoran State 
Petroleum Enterprise. 
  The provinces through which the Andes mountain range crosses 
have been cut off from each other because the main highways have 
been blocked. Hundreds of Conaie members armed with work tools 
such as machetes and picks occupied the roads, which they are 
not leaving for any reason despite the presence, until now 
peaceful, of troops and policemen. 
  Nevertheless, the unrest got worse yesterday when Indians 
looted stores and the public market of the city of Canar, in the 
Andean province of the same name. This action provoked a 
reaction from merchants. Approximately 20 Indians and merchants 
were injured in the violent clashes, during which weapons 
appeared. 
  Segundo Serrano, mayor of Azogues, the capital of Canar, 
told 
AFP by telephone that in the violence an Indian died from blows 
to the head. This has been officially confirmed by authorities. 
He added that, according to reports from Indian leader Jose 
Guaman, the merchants burned a community house and that the 
bodies of at least three Indians were found among the rubble. 
This has yet to be confirmed. 
  "The situation was on the verge of getting even worse when 
the Canar Indians tried to start a fire in a fuel distribution 
facility in the city of Canar," Serrano added. He indicated that 
the city awoke today under the military control of Army troops, 
which were urgently deployed to the site to try to retake 
control and prevent more violence. "The people of Canar are 
living tense times. There is great fear in the center of the 
city, which only has five policemen," he said. The mayor also 
said the Indians have reportedly threatened to come down from 
the mountains to burn the city. 
  Meanwhile, Conaie Vice President Rafael Pandam told AFP that 
another Indian was killed on Thursday in Tungurahua Province (in 
southern Ecuador) during the protests. He said the Indians will 
"oppose to the death" the agrarian law because it harms their 
interests and demands. As an example, he said the elimination of 
the Ecuadoran Institute of Agrarian Reform and Settlement 
(IERAC) also means the disappearance of the legal distribution 
of land to the Indians, who will have to seek new lands at the 
same time that arbitrary settlements are encouraged. 
  Conaie President Luis Macas urged the Court of 
Constitutional 
Guarantees (in charge of enforcing the laws) and the 
constitutional chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice "not to 
permit such big violations of the constitution because this 
would lay the groundwork for absolute chaos in all areas."

    [Editorial Report] Crime rates have increased in direct 
proportion to the socioeconomic crisis affecting the country 
and, according to an article by Javier Simancas in the Guayaquil 
daily EL UNIVERSO of 29 May, kidnapping for ransom of 
businessmen and politicians has intensified from 1992 to the 
present. The national police have stated that the problem is 
neither "accidental" nor linked to worsening socioeconomc 
conditions, but directly related to the immigration of entire 
mafia-type organizations and "subversive groups" from 
neighboring countries. Police statements add that Ecuador has 
become an easy target for these organizations to earn money by 
these means. In the past two years, 15 kidnappings have been 
officially reported that have earned the perpetrators a billion 
sucres. According to EL UNIVERSO, kidnapping crimes are 
concentrated in the Amazon areas of Sucumbios because that area 
is conducive to the free movement of organizations between 
Colombia and Ecuador. The article also pointed out that the 
cities of Guayaquil and Quito are not exempt from this type of 
crime. 
  Minister of Defense Jose Gallardo, however, denied that 
crimes of kidnapping are a real threat to the country and 
minimized their links to terrorist organizations. He added "it 
is not true that kidnapping has become an unmanageable scourge," 
and stated that although Sucumbios had been the site for many of 
these crimes, they have been "totally eliminated" at present. 
Gallardo further noted that in Guayaquil, as well, many 
kidnapping attempts "were controlled in time."

<F P=106> [Interview with President-elect Ernesto Samper by reporter </F>
Ana Fernanda Valderama and unidentified station announcers at 
Samper's apartment in Bogota, Colombia; from the "National 
Newscast" -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Announcer] In his few hours as president-elect, 
Ernesto Samper has begun explaining what his administration's 
course of action will be. Meanwhile, speculation has begun 
about his administration. The "National Newscast" consulted a 
specialist in predictions. He is astrologist Mauricio Puerta, 
who a year ago predicted Samper's victory by a close vote as 
occurred yesterday. 
  [Begin Puerta recording] House No. 10 is the house of power. 
You see he was born with Saturn in House 10. Saturn is 
responsibilities and achievements. He has made efforts. Today, 
he is in house four, which is the fatherland, over Jupiter. 
Jupiter, which is his birth, in astrology is culture and if 
Saturn is time, then this is the time for culture. But 
Sagittarius is religion and Pluto goes around every 250 years. 
In other words, Pluto was also in Sagittarius and that was 
called the Inquisition. That is why some of the biggest 
problems the new administration will have to face are problems 
with the church. [passage omitted] [end recording] 
  [Announcer] We now have direct contact with president-elect 
Ernesto Samper Pizano. Ana Fernanda Valderama is at his 
apartment where the plans of the new government are being drawn 
up. Go ahead Ana: 
  [Valderama] Good afternoon Maria Beatriz, president-elect 
Ernesto Samper was watching the "National Newcast" showing the 
astrology card drawn up by Mauricio Puerta. You are going to 
have a lot of problems with cassocks. In fact, you had some at 
the end of your campaign. How are you going to overcome them? 
  [Samper] In the first place, I hope they are isolated 
problems, not a general problem. What occurred in the campaign 
was in no way a confrontation with the church, with all the 
cassocks, but with some isolated members who made their call to 
religious fanaticism felt. Moreover, I think part of the 
support I received yesterday was support in favor of tolerance 
and against religious war. Therefore, as far as I am concerned, 
that prediction by Mauricio Puerta is going to refer exclusively 
to some isolated cases. 
  [Valderama] Well, Dr. Samper, it seems there is a question 
from the "National Newscast" studios. 
  [Announcer] That is right Maria Fernanda, but first we are 
going to ask Dr. Samper to watch the following report because it 
has not been 24 hours since he was declared the winner and some 
people have already begun to settle accounts. We invite him to 
watch this initial settling of accounts from the coast and later 
we will ask him a question. 
  [Begin recording] [Senator Juan Jose Garcia] Let us hope 
that 
Samper will give us what Dr. Lopez gave us. The Atlantic coast 
also elected him. He gave us three ministries: Public Works, 
Health, and Agriculture. 
  [Senator Carlos Espinoza in progress]...national planning. 
Because if we only had national planning, we could have an 
influence on the decisions by the state to promote development. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What about the number of ministries? 
  [Espinoza] There must be at least three or four ministers 
from the coast. 
  [Senator Eugenio Diaz] At the Senate's proposal, Dr. Samper 
Pizano went to [word indistinct]. He promised us an advisory 
office for the Atlantic coast. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] Well, Dr. Samper you have heard the proposals 
and 
expectations from the coast. Will your cabinet respond to these 
invitations or will it simply be a technical cabinet that 
responds to Colombian's needs? 
  [Samper] Well, it is not going to be a technical cabinet. It 
will be a cabinet of technicians with political responsibility. 
I am sure that many valuable people from the coast fulfill both 
conditions. In other words, they will have the technical 
training required for such a high position and they will also 
have the ability to assume a political commitment because that 
is what this requires. Of course, the coast is going to be 
represented in my cabinet. It is one of the most important 
regions in the country. In my campaign program, the coast had 
and will continue to have a fundamental role in my 
administration. This includes the recovery of its agricultural 
sector and the consolidation of its infrastructure, above all, 
the increase of social infrastructure through public services 
such as health, education, and housing. In 12 hours, things 
have not changed for me. I maintain the promises I made to the 
coast. We are going to work actively so the coast will not only 
be represented in government positions but essentially in my 
administration's development plan. 
  [Announcer] But Dr. Samper, numerically how many positions 
will the coast obtain? 
  [Samper] No, I do not think you can look at this just 
through 
quotas of two, three, or five. I want to bring people who are 
representative of the Caribbean coast so they can be involved in 
a government program in which the Caribbean will of course have 
a fundamental role. 
  [Announcer] Shortly before 2100, five hours after the polls 
closed, Andres Pastrana acknowledged the Liberal Party's 
victory. From the tone of his speech, analysts have begun to 
think that the decision of the losing candidate is to go to the 
opposition. [passage omitted] 
  [Begin recording] [Pastrana] I want to congratulate Ernesto 
Samper for his election as president of the Republic. [cheers] 
I assured the country a president who has received money from 
drug trafficking has no moral right to lead Colombia. We will 
continue to oppose with all our strength the legalization of 
drugs. 
  [Unidentified reporter] With these words, Andres Pastrana 
makes one think that he will become the biggest opponent of the 
Samper administration. He is backed by 3.5 million votes, 
enough to consolidate a real political force around him. 
Analysts think several paths are open to Pastrana. 
  [Political expert Fernando Cepeda] I think Colombian 
democracy will benefit from having someone in the opposition. 
  [Reporter] Others think this is not the candidate's style. 
  [Political expert Rodrigo Lozada] I do not think Pastrana 
will choose the alternative of carrying out a hard line 
opposition to the Samper administration. I do not think it 
corresponds with Pastrana's style. 
  [Reporter] Participation in the government party is another 
possibility for the defeated candidate. 
  [Political expert Eduardo Pizano] He can seek a very 
important partnership with the government, seek a government of 
national unity with strong participation in the cabinet. 
  [Reporter] What everyone agrees on is that if Pastrana's 
opinions continue with the same characteristics as yesterday's 
speech, there will be a real force of opposition to the ruling 
party for the first time in many years. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] Well, Dr. Samper, we have heard the opinions of 
some analysts who believe it is better for Pastrana to be in the 
opposition. What do you offer him? Do you offer cooperation 
with your administration? Will you receive him to participate 
in your administration or would you prefer, as some analysts 
say, that he stay in the opposition? 
  [Samper] I believe Andres Pastrana won a very important 
position yesterday. He obtained significant voting results 
yesterday. The decision as to whether or not he decides to 
cooperate, whether or not he deems it advisable for the position 
he has opened to engage or not in my administration depends, 
first of all, on the analysis they make of what their 
relationship should be with the government. For my part, I am 
ready to consider the decision they make, whether it be to 
remain in the opposition or to engage in working in a government 
of national unity, in view of the important number of votes 
obtained by both candidates yesterday. 
  [Announcer] Thank you Dr. Samper, we invite you to stay with 
us. We will continue to analyze yesterday's elections. The 
principal novelty yesterday was the high voter turnout. It was 
the highest voter turnout recorded in presidential elections in 
Colombia. Contrary to all the predictions that there would be 
increased abstentionism, 7.3 million Colombians went to vote. 
Abstentionism dropped from 66 percent in the primary elections 
to approximately 50 percent. That is 2 million votes more than 
on 29 May. These votes were distributed fairly, equally between 
the two candidates because the difference was 120,000 votes. 
This newscast consulted several newsmen to find out what they 
expect of Samper's administration and how they will judge him. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter] What do you expect of Ernesto 
Samper's administration? 
  [Columnist Jorge Child] I hope he will fulfill two basic 
promises. The one on social investment to increase jobs and the 
one on Latin American integration, which includes, of course, 
Cuba's admission to the OAS. 
  [Columnist Maria Teresa Herran] I hope that he will fulfill 
his campaign promises. 
  [Columnist Juan Gabrial Uribe] Yes, I think that Dr. Ernesto 
Samper can lead a good peace-keeping process in Colombia. 
  [Reporter] How will you carry out your watchdog activities 
of 
his government? 
  [Child] If he strays from his promises, if he engages in 
influence peddling, if he does not keep his promises to suspend 
privatizations, if he is not successful in his social policy, we 
will most certainly organize an opposition movement. 
  [Herran] He has promised to create [words indistinct] jobs. 
We will have to conduct a follow-up on how they are going to be 
created and how many will be created the first year. 
  [Uribe] We will conduct watchdog activities to ensure that 
what he has said about a fight against corruption is fulfilled. 
[end recording] 
  [Announcer] Well, Dr. Samper, you have heard that the 
columnists are going to keep an eye on you to see whether you 
fulfill your campaign promises, particularly the fight against 
corruption and your promise to create jobs. What is your answer 
to them? 
  [Samper] Basically, that I am disposed as a government 
leader 
to give them all the guarantees they require to conduct their 
watchdog activities. I think what a government needs most is a 
free and independent press, which can closely follow all 
government actions. I am very pleased with what the important 
columnists have said. 
  [Valderama] Well, Dr. Samper, the last question for you is 
what will be the first actions of your government on 8 August? 
  [Samper] On 7 August. [laughs] In addition to appointing the 
cabinet, I am thinking of promulgating some decrees to 
reactivate the agricultural sector because I have an affective 
and effective commitment to the recovery of that sector. 
  [Valderama] Thank you very much, Dr. Ernesto Samper, 
Colombian president-elect. This has been all the information we 
have from the home of Dr. Ernesto Samper.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 20 Jun (AFP) -- Liberal Ernesto 
Samper, Colombian president-elect, announced today that he will 
propose the creation of a binational cooperation commission with 
the United States to adopt joint strategies against drug 
trafficking. Samper added that he will accept "any technical 
support from this country" in that effort. 
  In a news conference with the foreign media in Colombia, 
Samper, who was elected president on Sunday after narrowly 
defeating his opponent, Conservative Andres Pastrana, insisted 
on the need to fight drug trafficking in a "global" and 
"comprehensive" manner. "We are not the perpetrators but the 
victims of drug trafficking," he said, lamenting the fact that 
the international community continues to think the drug 
trafficking problem is exclusive to Colombia. He said "it is 
imperative that we ensure greater effectiveness in the 
cooperation between Colombia and the United States" in this area. 
  Samper said the creation of a Colombian-U.S. commission, 
which would be made up of government and civilian 
representatives, would focus on permanently reviewing the 
cooperation policy, strengthening mutual trust, and ensuring the 
effectiveness of the various police, prevention, and 
rehabilitation programs. 
  He said the commission would work toward overcoming 
difficulties encountered by the two countries in their struggle 
against drug trafficking mafias, one example being the situation 
created by a recent Washington decision to withhold information 
obtained through U.S. radars in Colombia. Samper said he hopes 
to maintain "clear, frank, honest, and firm cooperation" with 
the Clinton administration in the struggle against drug 
trafficking. 
  As for U.S. military aid to fight mafiosos in Colombia, 
Samper said he welcomes "any U.S. technical support for our 
counternarcotics efforts." He also reaffirmed his disapproval 
of a recent ruling by the Constitutional Court legalizing the 
possession and consumption of minimum drug dosages in Colombia 
and announced that he is studying two legal alternatives to 
close the door on that ruling of the highest court, which is 
tasked with protecting the political Constitution. 
  Samper said he is studying the possibility of calling a 
referendum, as proposed by outgoing President Cesar Gaviria, or 
issuing a law to ban the use of drugs. 
  Samper, who will assume office on 7 August, announced he 
will 
maintain the voluntary surrender policy for drug traffickers 
implemented by Gaviria but will introduce certain changes, 
especially in terms of the sentences imposed on capos who decide 
to surrender. 
  Samper said he will make the sentences tougher and will not 
allow mafiosos to take advantage of the accumulation of sentence 
reductions specified in the prison code for common criminals. 
Finally, the Colombian president-elect demanded "strong 
international cooperation" in the struggle against drug 
trafficking.

  [Text] President-elect Ernesto Samper has talked about the 
internationalization of the economy. Judging from statements he 
made during the campaign, this internationalization will stress 
a strong policy to promote exports, and this policy will 
undoubtedly be based on a rectification of the policy on 
currency exchange. To this effect, working in coordination with 
the board of directors of Banco de la Republica will be 
necessary. 
  The new president will appoint two new members of the seven 
member monetary board in addition to the finance minister, 
totaling three out of seven people. The new president will need 
to have the concurrence of at least one additional board member 
in order to adopt the necessary currency exchange modifications 
to strengthen exports. It will be, therefore, a policy of 
opening up to international markets.

<F P=106> [Interview with President-elect Ernesto Samper and Andres </F>
Pastrana, the defeated New Democratic Force presidential 
candidate, at unspecified locations by studio announcers and 
reporters; from the "QAP" newscast -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Ines Maria Zavarain] Good evening. Ernesto 
Samper Pizano is the new Colombian president-elect. He won over 
his contender Andres Pastrana by a margin of more than 132,000 
votes. He is our special guest this evening. Good evening, Dr. 
Samper. 
  [Samper] Good evening, how are you doing? 
  [Zavarain] Very well, thank you. Tell us, when you awoke 
this morning, what was the first thing that came to your mind? 
Perhaps you thought it had all been a dream? 
  [Samper] Well, no. I felt as if a piano had been lifted off 
my head and an organ had been placed there instead. [sentence as 
heard] It was a sensation that is very difficult to describe. 
  [Zavarain] Victor Javier Solano has a question for you. 
  [Solano] Dr. Samper, I have a question on soccer and 
politics. Your campaign, at the last minute, used the figure of 
Pibe Valderrama, but it is obvious that that player was not able 
to get the team ready to face Romania in the World Soccer Cup 
game. How can you guarantee that you will get your team ready 
with the best? 
  [Samper] Well, I think that what happened to Pibe was a bad 
afternoon. Pibe continues to be the best soccer player in 
Colombia. I will follow his guidance on how to form teams to 
give the next Colombian administration a team of young people 
who are capable and honest, a polytechnical team. In other 
words, not only a technical team, but one that it will assume 
political responsibilities. 
  [Martha Lucia Avila] [Words indistinct] can you tell us? 
  [Samper] I am sorry; I was unable to hear you well. 
  [Zavarain] Go ahead Martha, ask your question. 
  [Avila] Dr. Samper, we would like to know who you missed in 
this campaign? Who would you have liked to share this triumph 
with? 
  [Samper] That is a good question. Perhaps I missed my 
father, from whom I learned a lot, such as his teachings about 
honesty and values. Also, I missed Luis Carlos Galan, who is 
permanently in my thoughts. I remember him with special 
affection today. 
  [Zavarain] Maribel do you have another question for Dr. 
Samper? 
  [Maribel Osorio] Yes, Dr. Samper. You called for and 
received the support of the alliance for Colombia. Does this 
mean that during your government, we will see a Conservative, an 
Anapista, a Christian, a representative of the black sector, a 
General Maza, or how will you resolve the problem of these 
alliances? 
  [Samper] Well, the truth is that all of these independent 
sectors that accompanied me did so very loyally. I think they 
contributed to my victory yesterday. Of course, they will have 
a place in the government. That place, however, is not only 
that they will be able to have a representative position in the 
government, but also they will share in the government's project 
of social investment, of increasing productive jobs, of the 
peace project, on which we started working this very morning. 
They will be involved in the next administration's project. 
  [Osorio] Let us return to the topic of the ministers and we 
will ask you to give us a name, of the government minister or 
the defense minister, for instance. 
  [Samper] If I could give you these names, I would gladly do 
so. The truth is that forming a cabinet is like playing chess. 
If you miss one of the plays, you mess up your whole game, so 
you are going to have to wait awhile to learn the names. 
  [Osorio] Dr. Fernando Botero, for instance, has come up as 
defense minister. Is that right, can you tell us something? 
  [Samper] He meets all the conditions for an excellent 
defense 
minister. 
  [Zavarain] Dr. Samper, Adriana Larota has a question from 
Los 
Angeles. Go ahead, Adriana. 
  [Larota] Mr. President [as heard], good evening. Now that it 
is almost time for the whistle to be blown to start the game, 
what do you think? Are you going to be an offensive or a 
defensive player? 
  [Samper] Well, I will be on the offensive, but not on the 
basis of fouls, corners, side throws, or out of bounds, but a 
clean offensive, like that carried out by our Colombian team, 
with a lot of plays and passes to make many goals for the many 
problems that afflict Colombians. 
  [Zavarain] Dr. Samper, continuing with the topic of soccer, 
as Pibe Valderrama says, everything is fine. Is everything fine? 
  [Samper] Everything is fine, everything is fine. 
  [Zavarain] All right, Dr. Samper, we ask you to stay with us 
because we will return to you later in the cast. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Zavarain] We now welcome Dr. Andres Pastrana. Good 
evening, Dr. Pastrana. 
  [Pastrana] Good evening. 
  [Zavarain] We have invited you to pay tribute to your 
campaign. After all, you received 3.5 million votes, the 
highest number of votes received by a conservative candidate in 
our history. We would like to know what you plan to do with all 
that electoral support. 
  [Pastrana] I will continue working. The Colombian people 
have given me a mandate of 3.5 million votes, which is 50 
percent of the vote. Those 3.5 million votes are sending us a 
message. They say that change is possible, that it is possible 
to defeat the old policy, the machinery. They are telling us 
that the country wants to build a new Colombia. Therefore, we 
will work hard with those 3.5 million Colombians, and many more, 
to build the Colombia we want so much. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Good evening, Dr. Pastrana. Last 
night, after acknowledging the partial results of the elections, 
you made a statement that has given rise to many doubts. I 
invite you to hear the recording. 
  [Pastrana] Let us hear it. 
  [Begin Pastrana recording] That is why I assured the country 
that a president who has received money from drug traffickers 
has no moral authority to lead Colombia. [end recording] 
  [Reporter] Dr. Pastrana, what exactly did you mean? 
  [Pastrana] You know that since Friday I have been deeply 
concerned because, a week ago, the international media -- TIME 
magazine, and other U.S. media -- published reports hinting that 
drug money was being used in the political campaign. During the 
previous campaign there were 18 candidates, and I insisted that 
we all should send a note to the U.S. Government demanding 
clarification of who they were referring to. Later on, when 
only Dr. Samper and I were campaigning, the media insisted on 
saying that there was money from drug trafficking. Therefore, I 
sent a letter to Dr. Samper to tell him -- as I said in my 
letter -- that I have no knowledge of any funds from drug 
trafficking used in my campaign. Therefore, I swear before God 
and my conscience that I can say to Colombians that there were 
no such funds. I believed a reply to my letter from Dr. Samper 
was important to tell the world that there was no money from 
drug trafficking in our respective campaigns. 
  [Reporter] You have specifically said that there was no 
money from drug trafficking in your campaign, and that there 
were only two candidates. Do you mean that Ernesto Samper has 
no moral authority to lead the country? 
  [Pastrana] No, no. In my letter to Dr. Samper, I invited 
him to tell the world that if it was confirmed that there were 
funds from drug trafficking in either of our campaigns, that 
candidate would resign from the Colombian presidency because it 
would be an affront to the Republic and the nation. 
  [Reporter] Did you receive a reply to that letter? 
  [Pastrana] No, I have not received a reply, but I hope Dr. 
Samper... 
  [Reporter, interrupting] Do you have proof that drug money 
was used in the electoral campaign? 
  [Pastrana] No, no. I simply said that no such funds were 
used in my campaign, that I could swear before God and my 
conscience that those funds did not exist. I invited Dr. Samper 
to do the same so the world and the media would know that in 
Colombia there is no drug money in our campaigns. 
  [Reporter] Will you participate directly in Samper's 
government? 
  [Pastrana] I have not really thought about that yet. I am 
currently talking with our people. Whether we participate or 
not is not the real issue. My message to Dr. Samper is: We 
will support you in all the good things you do. Whenever we 
think we should criticize and contribute with our ideas, we will 
do so. We are not in favor of the old policy in the sense that 
if we are given a ministry, we will participate in the 
government. If the government does a good job and we believe 
that the results are good, Dr.Samper can be sure we will support 
him. We will also criticize the government when necessary. 
  [Zavarain] Thank you, Dr. Pastrana. 
  [Congote] Ines Maria, before going to more news, I would 
like to ask Dr. Ernesto Samper a question. Good evening, Dr. 
Samper; this is Gloria Congote. In view of Dr. Pastrana's 
proposal and to eliminate any doubts Colombians may have about 
you, would you truly be willing to resign from the presidency 
should it be discovered illegal funds were used in your campaign? 
  [Samper] Gloria, I do not think resignation is the issue. I 
think the doubts expressed by Dr. Pastrana are reckless because 
they compromise, in one way or another, the entire country in 
the eyes of the nation [as heard]. I interpret it as an attempt 
to discredit the electoral results. Over the past few days, I 
have said emphatically that no drug money was used in my 
campaign. 
  As proof I described the ethics code that has guided us from 
the very beginning of the campaign, not just now at the end, as 
Dr. Pastrana suggested, but for the entire year. We implemented 
this code to keep an eye on all funds entering the national 
treasury. I want to invite any reporter or anyone at all who 
wants to review our books to check the origins of all funds. We 
adopted this institutional procedure a year ago to monitor where 
our resources were coming from. 
  [Congote] Dr. Samper, why didn't you answer Dr. Pastrana's 
letter? 
  [Samper] I answered it publicly. I received his letter two 
days after the media received it [chuckles]. I answered it as I 
told you, and I repeat: A year ago, ours was the first campaign 
team to worry about money of doubtful origin or about the 
concentration of resources in the campaign. That is why we 
established these procedures so we can show anyone our books and 
the origins of the funds. 
  [Reporter] Dr. Samper, you said you will govern without 
rancor. Would you include Andres Pastrana in your cabinet? 
  [Samper] I would if the right political conditions are 
present. What are those conditions? The movement headed by Dr. 
Pastrana must decide if it wants to be part of the opposition or 
if it wants to cooperate with the government. If the latter is 
true, we would define the terms for this possible cooperation, 
and as I said before the campaign, I would be pleased to have 
Dr. Andres Pastrana. 
  [Reporter] Dr. Samper, given the very hectic campaign of the 
past three weeks, what will you be doing in the days prior to 
assuming office? 
  [Samper] I will plan the transition process this week. I 
will tell you that we will hold the first transition meeting 
between my campaign team and the government team at 1700 on 21 
June. President Gaviria and I will participate. We will hold 
three transition meetings this week. The government drafted a 
document, which we are already analyzing, on carrying out a 
trouble-free transition. We will continue working. 
  [Zavarain] Dr. Samper, will you accompany the Colombian 
soccer team to upcoming games? 
  [Samper] Yes, I am thinking about accompanying the Colombian 
team to Sunday's game; that is, to the definitive match when 
everything is at stake.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 20 Jun (EFE) -- Andres Pastrana, 
the Conservative Party candidate who lost the Sunday elections 
for the Colombian Presidency to Liberal Party candidate Ernesto 
Samper, announced today that he has no plans to cooperate with 
the new government. 
  Pastrana declared to Radio Cadena Nacional that, in 
principle, his political group, New Democratic Force (NFD), has 
no interest in "bureaucratic quotas" in the new government, 
which Samper will lead from 7 August until the same date in 1998. 
  After tallying up 97 percent of the votes, Ernesto Samper 
garnered 3,679,632 of the 7,353,846 votes cast (50.3 percent), 
and Pastrana garnered 3,553,146 (48.6 percent). 
  "I believe that one must support the good things for the 
nation, but when we have to criticize the new government we will 
do so," Pastrana noted. The conservative leader added that the 
NFD will "be on the watch" with regard to the new government. 
"During the campaign, Samper said he would only work with those 
who supported his candidacy. Therefore, we have not considered 
it because Samper had previously excluded people," Pastrana 
said. 
  Meanwhile, the president-elect stated that Pastrana's 
campaign "will have to make the decision on what its relations 
with the new government will be." Samper said: "Based on that 
statement, I am willing to consider a possible link between my 
government and the sector that Pastrana represents." 
  Pastrana's group held several government posts in the 
administration of outgoing President Cesar Gaviria, among which 
was the Development Ministry, which is responsible for promoting 
economic openness.

<F P=106> [Speech by Humberto de la Calle Lombana, Liberal Party vice </F>
presidential candidate, from the Gonzalo Jimenez de Quesada 
Convention Center in Santa Fe de Bogota -- live] 
  [Text] Mr. Ernesto Samper Pizano, president-elect of 
Colombia; Mrs. Jaquin Samper; Rosalba [De la Calle's wife]; 
Friends; Colombians: I would like to thank all Colombians for 
the clean and democratic victory that Mr. Samper and Mr. De la 
Calle achieved today. It has been a long, hard campaign. At 
times, it even went as far as personal attacks, but we have no 
hard feelings. It is time for generosity and to stand tall. It 
is time for our spirits to be calm so we can conduct our 
administration without discrimination. 
  I also thank Mr. Ernesto Samper. Mr. Samper has been a 
champion of democracy and a generous friend. In offering me the 
opportunity to be his running mate on the presidential ticket, 
he has allowed me to continue to serve Colombia. I admire his 
devotion to social justice. It is a genuine devotion; not 
improvised. I see in Samper the great leader of social justice 
in Colombia. [cheers] It was on this specific issue -- serving 
the poor people of Colombia, men and women of flesh and blood -- 
that we found our greatest affinity in this victorious ticket. 
  I also thank Jaquin for her dedication and assistance I 
would like to reaffirm what I said during the campaign: I am a 
man of the countryside. I am not ashamed to be a man of the 
provinces, and I will continue to be one. I want to make the 
vice presidency the home of the Colombian countryside. What 
Colombia needs is a vice presidency that will reinforce national 
unity by recognizing the diversity of its regions and by 
realizing the potential, the drive, and the creativity of the 
Colombian provinces. [cheers] 
  Our victory, the victory of Ernesto Samper, is also a 
victory 
of the Liberal spirit and of tolerance over fanaticism. It is a 
victory for self-evaluation and pluralism. That is what has 
risen victorious today, my friends. We do not want fanaticism, 
sectarianism, or discrimination in the modern Colombia we have 
envisioned. There will be no room for discrimination on the 
grounds of sex, color, race, creed, or religious belief in the 
Samper administration. [cheers]. 
  As vice president, I also hope to contribute to the 
development of our constitution and the statutory law governing 
the administration of justice. In so doing, we will advance the 
fight against crime, drug trafficking, and drugs in favor of 
true democratic justice for all Colombians. [cheers] The new 
legal instrument for requesting the protection of our 
constitutional rights is the most revolutionary means to truly 
protect our fundamental rights. 
  I believe in reinforcing the resources available in the 
municipalities and departments. This will allow them to fulfill 
their responsibilities, particularly toward social justice. As 
its name suggests, this is a social justice directed at the men 
and women of the masses; the men and women of flesh and blood; 
the men and women of Colombia who have no privileges. 
  We want justice in education and health. We believe the 
first priority for this new government is social investment, the 
search for the vindication of the poor people of Colombia. My 
dear friends, we are behind the poor people of Colombia, not the 
powerful. [crowd cheers] 
  President Cesar Gaviria must be recognized for the 
development of the Constitution. President Gaviria, by 
promoting constitutional changes, transformed Colombia's 
philosophy. In my opinion, what we are looking at now is a more 
modern Colombia with a greater willingness to achieve victory 
and to come out ahead. We want a more optimistic Colombia. 
  As Ernesto Samper has said, I hope to contribute from the 
vice presidency by representing Colombia internationally. We 
are going to fight for human rights, against drug trafficking, 
and for the protection of natural resources and the environment 
of Colombia and the world. 
  Ernesto Samper asked me to help renew the Liberal Party. I 
will never give up trying to accomplish that goal. As president 
of the Liberal Party's Renewal Commission, I hope to conclude 
our mission before 6 August. As of today, I wish to convene a 
Liberal Party convention. We need a more democratic, active, 
and institutional party with a greater committment to the fight 
against corruption. [crowd shouts: Long live the Liberal Party!] 
  I want to tell you that it is a pleasure to have the support 
of millions and millions of Colombians. I am especially 
grateful because I am not a professional politician. I do not 
think I am a man who has turned politics into a profession. I 
come from another field, but my victory today not only commits 
me to Colombia but also teaches me something I heard from Luis 
Carlos Galan, who said if one does not do politics, others will 
do it for you. With Samper we will try to do good politics for 
all Colombians without discrimination, my dear friends. [crowd 
cheers] 
  I conclude by thanking Rosalba and my sons. I want to say 
that without their help and understanding, my dreams of working 
for a more egalitarian society would not have been possible. 
Thank you, thank you my dear friends, and a big hug for 
Colombians. Thank you very much.

  [Text] Yesterday, Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff 
requested Congress study the possibilities of establishing 
external controls on the immense power held by the institution 
he heads. He also asked the legislature to explore mechanisms 
to establish other types of precautionary measures, other than 
imprisonment, to ensure that those under investigation appear 
before prosecutors and judges. 
  The prosecutor general's requests were made yesterday during 
a seminar for criminal prosecutors organized by the Attorney 
General's Office. De Greiff, Attorney General Carlos Gustavo 
Arrieta, Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez, and Deputy Prosecutor 
General Francisco Sintura attended the seminar. 
  Regarding the first request, the prosecutor general said 
legislators had not established controls on "the great amount of 
power given to prosecutors and that it is necessary to establish 
controls for the future." 
  De Greiff said there is a 2d Court of Appeals at the 
Prosecutor General's Office, but this in itself is a 
contradiction because those who file suit in the 1st and 2d 
Courts of Appeals are delegates of the prosecutor general and 
belong to a body that has a unified administration, hierarchy, 
and follows general administrative procedures and criminal 
guidelines established by the prosecutor general of the 
Republic. "We respect this 2d Court of Appeals, because we do 
not attempt to have absolute power but, rather, one sole 
criminal policy, not many policies as in the past," the 
prosecutor general said. 
  Regarding precautionary measures, he said "arrest warrants 
must be issued as an exception and when we do not have a 
guarantee the person under investigation will present himself to 
the authorities. It is more appropriate to promote legislative 
reforms that will allow us other types of precautionary 
measures, such as bail," de Greiff said. 
  He admitted there are prosecutors who are quick to issue 
precautionary measures and involve people in cases. "Certain 
prosecutors are frequently quick to issue precautionary 
measures, and we have noticed people are precipitately involved 
many times in cases under investigation, as can be seen at 
inquiries when the prosecutor does not have all the necessary 
facts to ask questions," de Greiff added. 
  The prosecutor general also said the institutions can no 
longer allow validation of the assertion: "Nobody is refused an 
arrest warrant in Colombia." "This sentence is shocking and has 
been in effect since the time when there were criminal 
investigation judges." 
  The prosecutor general stated his position regarding a 
possible increase of jail sentences for several crimes and said 
increasing the penalties to the maximum is not the solution. 
The important thing is, he said, to have a penitentiary system 
that guarantees the rehabilitation of the criminal. "We gain 
nothing by putting all the hoods in jail if we do not have a 
penitentiary system that will give them a chance to 
rehabilitate," de Greiff said. 
<H5>  Arrest Warrants </H5>
  "Several people say the best system is the one in the United 
States, where drug traffickers are given long sentences or life. 
Let me tell you this is not true. Those penalties are imposed 
on Colombian drug traffickers, not U.S. drug traffickers. I do 
not know of a single case where a U.S. drug trafficker has been 
sentenced to life." 
  For his part, Arrieta said the Attorney General's Office 
should be committed to completing its investigations, that its 
role should expand and include the assurance that due process is 
complied with to safeguard respect for human rights, and that 
the law is interpreted and implemented correctly. "The main 
goal is to advance from formulating measures to restricting 
personal freedom to the point where such measures are only used 
when necessary to guarantee the appearance of those accused at 
court," the attorney general said. 
  According to Arrieta, personnel of the Attorney General's 
Office must be vigilant in stopping certain prosecutors' abuses 
of issuing preventive arrest warrants. "We must adapt Colombian 
criminal law to international laws that recommend freedom as a 
basic principle during the investigative phase and thus leave 
jails for those who are serving imposed sentences." 
  For his part, the justice minister said the current Criminal 
Procedures Code had improved the trial system because, according 
to him, it was an important instrument in inhibiting impunity, 
clearing the backlog in legal offices, and avoiding expiration 
of investigations. 
<H5>  No contacts with the Cali Cartel </H5>
  Yesterday, De Greiff and Arrieta said they have had no 
contacts with lawyers of important Cali Cartel members for 
several months. According to de Greiff, the Prosecutor General's 
Office is waiting for the Valle drug traffickers to understand 
that the best alternative is to surrender to justice and that 
his office is willing to further this process. Arrieta said 
"the Cali Cartel lawyers are most surely waiting for the change 
in government to reinitiate their advances." 
  The prosecutor general and the attorney general commented on 
other current national events: 
  The Hidden Microphones in Samper's Campaign: The prosecutor 
general said it is being investigated, "but it will be difficult 
to find the culprits in this crime due to a lack of evidence. 
We will investigate as much as possible." 
  Retirement Age: The prosecutor said he is waiting for the 
Supreme Court to define if he is an official with an established 
term or if he must retire when he is 65 years of age. 
  Church and Politics: The attorney general said the call made 
by several bishops for their parishioners to vote for one of the 
candidates is unjustified. "I believe Monsignor Castrillon's 
call was a personal one and did not include the church as a 
whole. Church interference in politics is something we have 
already surpassed. It does not have any justification at this 
time." 
  Disaster Attention Office: The attorney general said the 
Attorney General's Office will investigate as soon as the 
emergency subsides whether the officials in that government 
office had been negligent. "What is important now is attending 
to the victims. We will start to investigate once this phase is 
over. It would be senseless to do so now."

    [Editorial Report] On 24 May, the Attorney General's Office 
and the Colombian Banking Association (Asobancaria) concluded an 
agreement intended to strengthen the government's hand in 
detecting and fighting official corruption. The agreement will 
facilitate the examination of bank records by authorities 
looking for evidence of money obtained through illegal means. 
Specifically, the agreement provides for a smoother exchange of 
banking information between the Office of Special Investigations 
(OIE) -- the department of the Attorney General's Office 
responsible for much of the preliminary investigative work in 
cases of administrative corruption -- and Asobancaria, and will 
improve the latter's technical support to the OIE. (EL TIEMPO 25 
May; EL ESPECTADOR 26 May) President Cesar Gaviria, who 
attended the signing ceremony at the presidential palace, 
hailed the agreement as an "extremely important step forward" in 
coordinating efforts by the state and civil society to fight 
administrative corruption. He added that the accord is part of a 
larger strategy to prevent use of the country's financial system 
"to conceal investments or make use of resources obtained by 
means of illicit activities." Attorney General Carlos Gustavo 
Arrieta described the agreement as "a veritable revolution" in 
the struggle to fight illicit enrichment, and said it would 
"greatly reduce" investigation time. (EL TIEMPO 25 May) 
  Although financial institutions were already required to 
provide the Attorney General's Office with information upon 
request, the process whereby OIE investigators collected the 
data was time-consuming, subject to leaks, and did not always 
receive the full cooperation of bank officials, according to EL 
ESPECTADOR (26 May). By greatly streamlining procedures for 
gathering information and relaying it to the appropriate 
authorities, the new agreement could reduce OIE investigative 
work by as much as 75 percent, according to EL TIEMPO (25 May). 
  In a commentary in EL ESPECTADOR (29 May), Arrieta explained 
that the agreement eliminates the need for investigators to go 
from bank to bank, including individual branch offices, 
throughout the country searching for a suspect's accounts as 
well as those of family members or others which may have been 
used to conceal the illicit activity. Now, an investigator can 
simply report a suspect's name to Asobancaria's Center for 
Financial Sector Information (Cifin), which will be required 
quickly to provide all relevant information from its data bank 
of current information on accounts and transactions made at the 
country's financial institutions. (EL ESPECTADOR 29 May; EL 
TIEMPO 25 May) 
  In addition, the new procedures will help to ensure the 
confidentiality of investigations. Arrieta notes that, under the 
previous system, numerous bank officials were involved in 
responding to an OIE inquiry, increasing the risk that a suspect 
would be alerted to the investigation. Under the new system, 
however, each institution will appoint a representative to the 
Cifin working group who will be responsible for handling all 
requests for information from that institution. (EL TIEMPO 25 
May) 
  Addressing reports that bank officials had sometimes failed 
to cooperate fully with OIE investigators in the past, Arrieta 
said that in signing the agreement the financial system has 
"given its full commitment to the fight against corruption." (EL 
TIEMPO 25 May) 
  The agreement also calls for Asobancaria to provide 
investigators with training and ongoing assistance in 
understanding the more technical details of banking operations. 
Arrieta noted that such cooperation is especially important 
because criminals have refined their methods of concealing the 
illegal origin of their money. (EL ESPECTADOR 29 May) 
  Asobancaria and the Prosecutor General's Office are 
reportedly working out a similar agreement. (EL ESPECTADOR 26 
May)

<F P=106> [Interview with Fidel Castano; place and date not given; </F>
first paragraph is SEMANA introduction] 
  [Text] A few days ago, through the intercession of the 
attorney who is representing Fidel Castano before the Prosecutor 
General's Office, SEMANA was able to interview the paramilitary 
commander, who is one of the country's most wanted men. Having 
secured responses to the initial questionnaire and then to some 
additional questions, SEMANA's editorial board decided to 
publish them since Castano offers many revelations about some of 
the biggest crimes in recent years. 
  [SEMANA] Your hatred for the guerrillas reportedly stems 
from 
the murder of your father, whom the subversives executed after 
kidnapping him and after you paid a ransom. How did that story 
go? 
  [Castano] My father was kidnapped in 1981 from an estate he 
owned in the municipality of Segovia (Antioquia) by the Fourth 
Front of the FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia], 
which demanded 100 million pesos for his release. It was 
impossible to raise that amount of money at the time, inasmuch 
as our total wealth was not even half that much. Nevertheless, 
with the help of several local ranchers and a loan that the 
Amalfi Agricultural Credit Bank gave us under the Estate Law, we 
got together 30 million pesos and paid them. They then told me 
that 70 million was missing. I told them that I did not have 
that kind of money and that if I ever did, I would use it for 
nothing else but to combat them. My defiant reply was the reason 
they killed him. 
  [SEMANA] Did you start forming the paramilitary groups in 
Cordova after this episode? 
  [Castano] The group was actually created many years later. 
What I did right after my father's murder was to offer myself as 
a volunteer guide to the army, specifically to the Bombona 
Battalion in Puerto Berrio and the military base of the same 
battalion in Segovia. For two years, thanks to my help, as I 
told them the location of guerrilla camps and pointed out 
members of the FARC and the ELN [National Liberation Army], that 
battalion achieved excellent results in its operations. 
Concurrently, I received counterinsurgency training. 
  After that I began to realize that the methods that the army 
was using could counter the actions of the guerrilla groups but 
never exterminate them. So I decided to create my own group and 
began operating in northeastern Antioquia, the Middle Magdalena, 
as far as the department of Cordova. 
  [SEMANA] What was the purpose of these groups? Who financed 
them and how? 
  [Castano] At first the groups were small, just a few 
peasants 
who were being harmed by the guerrillas and who saw self-defense 
as a way of defending their lands from the abuses and atrocities 
committed against them and their families. In other words, we 
began our activities as self-defense and we later learned that 
the guerrillas had neither the courage nor the military and 
logistic capacity that was being attributed to them, inasmuch as 
they always avoided a direct confrontation with our people. It 
was really then that we started to deploy our forces and went on 
the offensive to cover other areas and, at the same time, mold 
our deployment to the guerrillas' area of influence. 
  [SEMANA] But who financed them? 
  [Castano] As for their financing, the self-defense groups 
have always been financed by the people who have economic 
interests in the zones in which these groups operate. 
  [SEMANA] These paramilitary groups reportedly sowed terror 
in 
Cordova, and the authorities point to you and these groups as 
the perpetrators of the massacres in Las Tangas, La Negra, and 
Punta Coquitos. The Supreme Court recently upheld a 20-year 
sentence against you in connection with these incidents. What 
actually happened? 
  [Castano] I must regrettably acknowledge that any armed 
group 
in an area of conflict of one sort or another terrifies the 
civilian population. Now then, the Supreme Court upheld a 
20-year sentence against me, but not for those massacres. On the 
contrary, I was acquitted in connection with them. I was 
convicted of conspiracy to commit a crime because I publicly 
admitted having had a self-defense group at the time of the 
demobilization, and we surrendered our weapons to the government. 
  What really happened was that back then there were various 
independent, uncontrolled self-defense groups, but the public 
seemed to think there was only one, mine, which they blamed for 
everything that happened in that region of the country. 
  [SEMANA] What did you achieve with the paramilitary groups 
in 
Cordova? 
  [Castano] During the time that my self-defense groups were 
in 
the Upper Sinu, there were no kidnappings by the guerrillas; 
land values rose; the ranchers were not paying protection money, 
and all of the cattlemen could calmly visit their ranches. In 
other words, the guerrillas were eradicated. 
  [SEMANA] You are said to be a man of the world who travels 
constantly and is a major art connoisseur. Is this true? 
  [Castano] I lived for three years in Paris, where I was in 
the artworks business. Before that, when circumstances allowed, 
I traveled through several countries like any other person who 
can afford to and has some taste. I do not have as much money as 
my friends have always thought; I consider myself an average 
person, a hard worker who struggles through life and is immersed 
in countless problems. But I am content and I am still alive. 
  [SEMANA] Let's move on to another subject. Did you ever work 
with Escobar? How did you meet him? How was your relationship 
with him at the outset? Did you two ever do business? 
  [Castano] I met Pablo Escobar in the late 1970's in 
Medellin; 
at the time I bought and sold cars on commission. I met him when 
I sold him several trucks, and we remained friends. We had 
certain things in common, and although it may seem odd, we had 
enormous sympathy for leftist ideology, so much so that on one 
occasion we tried to contact one of the guerrilla groups that 
existed at the time. But those leanings disappeared in him later 
when he started making a lot of money and in me when that 
guerrilla group kidnapped and later killed my father. It is 
incomprehensible to me that my eternal enemies once had my 
support. There are times when I think that if I had not had 
reason to become a counterinsurgent, I would have been a 
guerrilla. 
  I have to admit that I held Pablo in esteem back then, but 
not as greatly as I came to despise him because I never imagined 
that one day, in his obsession with money and power, he would 
become the most despicable and bloodthirsty man ever born in 
Colombia. 
  [SEMANA] The authorities have fingered you as one of the 
chiefs of the military wing of the Medellin Cartel. Is this true? 
  [Castano] I have never worked for anyone, and much less have 
I had bosses. I have not been a mercenary either. I have been 
independent and I take responsibility for my actions. 
  [SEMANA] Because of that link to Escobar you have been cited 
as one of the masterminds behind the blowing up of the Avianca 
jet. The Prosecutor General's Office linked you and Escobar to 
that case and recently ordered your arrest. Were you involved in 
that bombing? 
  [Castano] My war has been only with everything that smacks 
to 
me of the guerrillas. I do not blow up planes. I do not need to 
blow up a plane to kill someone famous. That reflects a lack of 
military resources. When you go into battle convinced that you 
are in the right and are acting with justice, you do not need to 
kill 107 people to achieve a goal. 
  [SEMANA] What arguments do you have to counter the charges 
that the Prosecutor General's Office has leveled at you? Do you 
have information about the person or persons who ordered the 
bombing, who carried it out, and what their reasons were to kill 
107 passengers? 
  [Castano] It is a secret to no one that Pablo Escobar was 
the 
mastermind of that awful bombing. He was the only one who could 
have thought of such an insane terrorist act. As for who carried 
it out, his deputies who are now fortunately behind bars in La 
Picota Prison in Bogota can answer that. 
  [SEMANA] Another of the crimes that the Prosecutor's Office 
has linked you to is the assassination of the former candidate 
of Patriotic Union, Bernardo Jaramillo Ossa. Last February an 
arrest warrant was issued for you, and your two brothers, 
Vicente and Carlos Castano, were also linked to the case. 
  [Castano] I had a role in that, but I was not the 
mastermind, 
much less the perpetrator. My brothers Carlos and Vicente had 
absoluetly nothing to do with the incident or with any of my 
activities outside the law. If I had been involved in any way in 
any other activity, I would also say so, because my goal is to 
have everyone pay for what he has done. 
  [SEMANA] You say that you did not kill Jaramillo. So who is 
to blame for his murder? 
  [Castano] It was ordered by Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, alias 
"El Mexicano," and directed by Ariel Otero and men working for 
Jaime Eduardo Rueda Rocha. 
  [SEMANA] But how were you involved? 
  [Castano] At a meeting that "El Mexicano" organized I was 
asked for my opinion, and I agreed with the order that he had 
given to execute the operation, the details of which I did not 
know. 
  [SEMANA] The courts also link you to the assassinations of 
Senator Alfonso Ospina Ospina and Father Sergio Restrepo. 
  [Castano] As for the murder of Father Sergio Restrepo, I can 
tell you that I have never had confrontations with the Church or 
with any of its members, and if there is anything that I am 
going to fight for, it is to show that I was not aware of 
anything that happened during the time that Dr. Alfonso Ospina 
was being held prisoner. I lent armed personnel to retired Army 
Captain Elkin Henao for some operations in the Middle Magdalena, 
and he used them behind my back to look after Dr. Alfonso Ospina 
during his captivity, all this in association with Pablo 
Escobar. I am absolutely certain that the Prosecutor's Office 
will acquit me of these charges. Why should I deny this, given 
the police record I have? 
  [SEMANA] What were the causes of your breakup with Escobar 
and more or less when did it happen? 
  [Castano] About 15 months before he was imprisoned in La 
Catedral, Pablo gave the ELN a lot of weapons, and this upset me 
greatly. We even had a bitter argument, and I never spoke to him 
again. I felt like going after him, but the truth is that he 
scared me. During the time that he was in La Catedral, in fact, 
the Moncadas and Fernando Galeano were murdered, and those of us 
who stayed alive felt obliged to fight against him because we 
had no other choice. 
  [SEMANA] Were you the founder of "Los Pepes"? 
  [Castano] On 21 February 1994 I sent the prosecutor general 
of the nation a memo saying: "I would like to clarify to you, 
Mr. Prosecutor General of the Nation, that in order to combat 
the despicable Pablo Escobar and his Medellin Cartel and to 
prevent them from continuing to attack the Colombian people and 
us, whom he persecuted tirelessly, I was the founder of the 
group that called itself `Los Pepes' and, at the same time, its 
military chief. In this and in my other activities outside the 
law, my brothers were not at all involved, as my enemies would 
have people believe." 
  [SEMANA] Why were "Los Pepes" established? 
  [Castano] It is my understanding that "Los Pepes" were not 
established. One day, 30 million Colombians persecuted by Pablo 
Escobar simply got fed up and banded together against him as 
society's response to the absolute power acquired by Escobar and 
his deputies, whom the State has now either killed or put behind 
bars. The city of Medellin was in the hands of a bunch of 
criminals, not common criminals but insane ones who killed and 
kidnapped innocent people like never before. So, there had to be 
a strong reaction, fighting fire with fire, or else we were 
lost. I think that Medellin and the entire country are breathing 
easier now that this thousand-headed monster and his famous 
cartel are gone. 
  [SEMANA] How were they organized? 
  [Castano] Everybody soon realized that the prison called La 
Catedral, where Pablo Escobar and his people were being held, 
had become a bunker in which murders were being committed and 
from which orders were given to kidnap, kill, and blackmail 
industrialists, businessmen, ranchers, and affluent people. 
Several distinguished persons sought me out and asked me to head 
up a self-defense group against Pablo Escobar. I thought up the 
name "Those persecuted by Pablo Escobar." 
  [SEMANA] How did "Los Pepes" operate? 
  [Castano] "Los Pepes" operated on two fronts. The first, 
called intelligence, was in charge of gathering all sorts of 
information on the structure of Pablo's organization. After the 
information had been gathered, it was conveyed by telephone or 
other channels to the appropriate authorities so that they could 
take advantage of it. The other front was called the action 
front; it was an armed group that I personally headed and that 
acted on the information to neutralize and destroy the enemy. 
  [SEMANA] How was the group financed? 
  [Castano] There was no problem with that. Industrialists, 
politicians, and cattlemen contributed money. We also raised 
money and earmarked it for this cause. 
  [SEMANA] Who else was part of the top brass in "Los Pepes"? 
  [Castano] That is for the Prosecutor's Office to find out. I 
cannot be disloyal on this point. 
  [SEMANA] "Los Pepes" claimed responsibility for a number of 
attacks, including the murder of Omar Canas, who played for the 
Atletico Nacional soccer team, and announced that other members 
of the team would meet the same fate. Why? 
  [Castano] I am not going to be the one who tarnishes the 
image of players on that team. We have all made mistakes in 
life, and anyway they are all adults. 
  [SEMANA] Why did you set fire to Pablo Escobar's homes, blow 
up his properties, and destroy his collection of automobiles? 
  [Castano] At some point someone had to battle Pablo by using 
his own methods. Pablo planted bombs, kidnapped, and then 
murdered his friends, but not before taking away all their money 
and property. He tortured and killed hundreds of people. So we 
were not going to combat someone as insane as him by dropping 
hints. The people wanted us to destroy Pablo without resorting 
to violence, but that was not possible. If things had been done 
that way, today all of us and the government itself would once 
again be on our knees at the feet of that monster. 
  [SEMANA] Why did you kill Guido Parra? 
  [Castano] The Guido Parra affair was indeed a regrettable 
mistake. The operation was a hasty one. One sector of the 
organization did not handle the matter with the proper 
restraint. Unfortunately, I was away, though I am not trying to 
dodge my responsibility by saying this. But, excesses are 
committed in war too. You have to understand, though, that this 
was not done gratuitously. The operational command of "Los 
Pepes" received information that Guido Parra was in direct 
contact with Pablo Escobar and that he served as his liaison for 
intelligence work and as an adviser on hide-outs and other 
operations. We know today that Pablo Escobar himself misinformed 
us and also that Dr. Guido Parra was no longer even his lawyer 
and that they had their differences because Escobar owed him a 
lot of money in fees. So, we were victims of Escobar's ploy to 
make us look like common murderers of innocent people. This was 
another of his wartime strategies. 
  [SEMANA] Why did you kill other attorneys for Escobar and 
his 
organization, like Salomon Lozano and Raul Zapata? 
  [Castano] In the case of Salomon Lozano, the legal adviser 
to 
Carlos Mario Urquijo, alias "Arete," we found that he was no 
longer his defense attorney. Instead, he served him as a 
courier, carrying letters with false accusations and conveying 
Pablo Escobar's instructions to attack "Los Pepes" in a bid to 
wage what they called "the legal war," so that they could use 
the military, in other words, government security forces, 
against me and the organization. 
  The same was the case with Raul Zapata. In short, these 
individuals strayed beyond the bounds of their profession and 
became common criminals in service to the people who were behind 
bars, not to solve their problems but to misinform. 
  [SEMANA] How did you collaborate with the Search Bloc in 
harassing Pablo Escobar? 
  [Castano] We never had direct contact with the Search Bloc. 
We gave it a lot of information through various channels that 
did not identify us. 
  [SEMANA] Is it true that you were involved in the operation 
in which Escobar died? In what other operations did you take 
part? 
  [Castano] No. I repeat: we never had any joint operations 
with the Search Bloc. The operation in which Escobar died was 
conducted exclusively by the police, as is public knowledge. 
  [SEMANA] What happened to "Los Pepes" after Escobar's death? 
Did they demobilize? 
  [Castano] After Escobar's death there was no reason for our 
organization to continue. Since that glorious 2 December no more 
people are being persecuted by Pablo Escobar in Colombia. 
  [SEMANA] Intelligence agencies report that after Escobar's 
death you had contacts with his family. Did you sign some sort 
of truce with his relatives? What are its terms? 
  [Castano] I spoke with Hermilda and told her that we had 
absolutely nothing against them, and I said the same thing to 
Maria Victoria in a letter. We never regarded Pablo's family or 
the families of the other cartel members as enemies. 
  [SEMANA] You demanded that Escobar's deputies who are in 
maximum-security prisons confess to all their crimes. Was there 
some sort of pact? 
  [Castano] I do not consider it a pact. I simply thought that 
the members of the cartel were making a mockery of the 
Prosecutor's Office. They turned themselves in and confessed to 
a minor crime, thus eluding us and hoping to go free in one 
year. At that point we demanded that each and every one of them 
confess to all their crimes, which would guarantee them at least 
10 years in prison. That way we would not have to go after them 
again, because the Prosecutor's Office would finally be 
punishing them for their crimes. 
  [SEMANA] What happened to the Medellin Cartel after 
Escobar's 
death? Did you take over as its leader? 
  [Castano] Drug trafficking has never attracted me. My 
businesses have always revolved around ranching and art. How am 
I supposed to head up a cartel that no longer exists? How am I 
supposed to spearhead a cause that was involved in drug 
trafficking, with which I have never agreed? I must admit that I 
was a friend of drug traffickers, but only because of my 
financial dealings. The Medellin Cartel died with Pablo Escobar. 
So, there is nothing to head up in Medellin. The only thing I 
want in my future is to live in the countryside, thus assuring 
the government that I, Fidel Castano, will never again break the 
peace in Colombia. 
  [SEMANA] What is your relationship with the Cali Cartel? 
Escobar always said that the Cali people and you were the heads 
of "Los Pepes." How was Cali involved in that organization? 
  [Castano] I have no relationship with what you call the Cali 
Cartel. I do not think that the cartel exists as such. I do have 
good friends in the Cauca Valley and I am grateful to them 
because they were the ones who provided the authorities with the 
most information about Pablo Escobar's narcoterrorists. 
  [SEMANA] Have you thought about turning yourself in to the 
authorities? 
  [Castano] I have thought about it repeatedly. But the 
outlook 
would be bleak for me because I know that it would take longer 
to get me into prison than to get myself killed there. I have a 
lot of enemies in jail, and they would not waste this unique 
opportunity to murder me. I think that all things considered, I 
will try to stay alive in the countryside. I would rather die 
there than give my enemies a chance to achieve their goal. So, I 
have promised myself that I will never allow myself to be taken 
to jail. I swear it. 
  [SEMANA] Is your paramilitary group still active? 
  [Castano] No, I do not have a paramilitary group, but I do 
have armed personnel to protect me, because I still live in a 
mountainous area alongside the FARC, the ELN, and a hard core of 
cattle rustlers from the Popular Liberation Army who dream of 
seeing me dead. When all is said and done, as long as I am 
living in a guerrilla zone, I will never be able to let down my 
guard.

<F P=106> [Interview with President-elect Ernesto Samper by reporter </F>
Ana Fernanda Valderama and unidentified station announcers at 
Samper's apartment in Bogota, Colombia; from the "National 
Newscast" -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Announcer] In his few hours as president-elect, 
Ernesto Samper has begun explaining what his administration's 
course of action will be. Meanwhile, speculation has begun 
about his administration. The "National Newscast" consulted a 
specialist in predictions. He is astrologist Mauricio Puerta, 
who a year ago predicted Samper's victory by a close vote as 
occurred yesterday. 
  [Begin Puerta recording] House No. 10 is the house of power. 
You see he was born with Saturn in House 10. Saturn is 
responsibilities and achievements. He has made efforts. Today, 
he is in house four, which is the fatherland, over Jupiter. 
Jupiter, which is his birth, in astrology is culture and if 
Saturn is time, then this is the time for culture. But 
Sagittarius is religion and Pluto goes around every 250 years. 
In other words, Pluto was also in Sagittarius and that was 
called the Inquisition. That is why some of the biggest 
problems the new administration will have to face are problems 
with the church. [passage omitted] [end recording] 
  [Announcer] We now have direct contact with president-elect 
Ernesto Samper Pizano. Ana Fernanda Valderama is at his 
apartment where the plans of the new government are being drawn 
up. Go ahead Ana: 
  [Valderama] Good afternoon Maria Beatriz, president-elect 
Ernesto Samper was watching the "National Newcast" showing the 
astrology card drawn up by Mauricio Puerta. You are going to 
have a lot of problems with cassocks. In fact, you had some at 
the end of your campaign. How are you going to overcome them? 
  [Samper] In the first place, I hope they are isolated 
problems, not a general problem. What occurred in the campaign 
was in no way a confrontation with the church, with all the 
cassocks, but with some isolated members who made their call to 
religious fanaticism felt. Moreover, I think part of the 
support I received yesterday was support in favor of tolerance 
and against religious war. Therefore, as far as I am concerned, 
that prediction by Mauricio Puerta is going to refer exclusively 
to some isolated cases. 
  [Valderama] Well, Dr. Samper, it seems there is a question 
from the "National Newscast" studios. 
  [Announcer] That is right Maria Fernanda, but first we are 
going to ask Dr. Samper to watch the following report because it 
has not been 24 hours since he was declared the winner and some 
people have already begun to settle accounts. We invite him to 
watch this initial settling of accounts from the coast and later 
we will ask him a question. 
  [Begin recording] [Senator Juan Jose Garcia] Let us hope 
that 
Samper will give us what Dr. Lopez gave us. The Atlantic coast 
also elected him. He gave us three ministries: Public Works, 
Health, and Agriculture. 
  [Senator Carlos Espinoza in progress]...national planning. 
Because if we only had national planning, we could have an 
influence on the decisions by the state to promote development. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What about the number of ministries? 
  [Espinoza] There must be at least three or four ministers 
from the coast. 
  [Senator Eugenio Diaz] At the Senate's proposal, Dr. Samper 
Pizano went to [word indistinct]. He promised us an advisory 
office for the Atlantic coast. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] Well, Dr. Samper you have heard the proposals 
and 
expectations from the coast. Will your cabinet respond to these 
invitations or will it simply be a technical cabinet that 
responds to Colombian's needs? 
  [Samper] Well, it is not going to be a technical cabinet. It 
will be a cabinet of technicians with political responsibility. 
I am sure that many valuable people from the coast fulfill both 
conditions. In other words, they will have the technical 
training required for such a high position and they will also 
have the ability to assume a political commitment because that 
is what this requires. Of course, the coast is going to be 
represented in my cabinet. It is one of the most important 
regions in the country. In my campaign program, the coast had 
and will continue to have a fundamental role in my 
administration. This includes the recovery of its agricultural 
sector and the consolidation of its infrastructure, above all, 
the increase of social infrastructure through public services 
such as health, education, and housing. In 12 hours, things 
have not changed for me. I maintain the promises I made to the 
coast. We are going to work actively so the coast will not only 
be represented in government positions but essentially in my 
administration's development plan. 
  [Announcer] But Dr. Samper, numerically how many positions 
will the coast obtain? 
  [Samper] No, I do not think you can look at this just 
through 
quotas of two, three, or five. I want to bring people who are 
representative of the Caribbean coast so they can be involved in 
a government program in which the Caribbean will of course have 
a fundamental role. 
  [Announcer] Shortly before 2100, five hours after the polls 
closed, Andres Pastrana acknowledged the Liberal Party's 
victory. From the tone of his speech, analysts have begun to 
think that the decision of the losing candidate is to go to the 
opposition. [passage omitted] 
  [Begin recording] [Pastrana] I want to congratulate Ernesto 
Samper for his election as president of the Republic. [cheers] 
I assured the country a president who has received money from 
drug trafficking has no moral right to lead Colombia. We will 
continue to oppose with all our strength the legalization of 
drugs. 
  [Unidentified reporter] With these words, Andres Pastrana 
makes one think that he will become the biggest opponent of the 
Samper administration. He is backed by 3.5 million votes, 
enough to consolidate a real political force around him. 
Analysts think several paths are open to Pastrana. 
  [Political expert Fernando Cepeda] I think Colombian 
democracy will benefit from having someone in the opposition. 
  [Reporter] Others think this is not the candidate's style. 
  [Political expert Rodrigo Lozada] I do not think Pastrana 
will choose the alternative of carrying out a hard line 
opposition to the Samper administration. I do not think it 
corresponds with Pastrana's style. 
  [Reporter] Participation in the government party is another 
possibility for the defeated candidate. 
  [Political expert Eduardo Pizano] He can seek a very 
important partnership with the government, seek a government of 
national unity with strong participation in the cabinet. 
  [Reporter] What everyone agrees on is that if Pastrana's 
opinions continue with the same characteristics as yesterday's 
speech, there will be a real force of opposition to the ruling 
party for the first time in many years. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] Well, Dr. Samper, we have heard the opinions of 
some analysts who believe it is better for Pastrana to be in the 
opposition. What do you offer him? Do you offer cooperation 
with your administration? Will you receive him to participate 
in your administration or would you prefer, as some analysts 
say, that he stay in the opposition? 
  [Samper] I believe Andres Pastrana won a very important 
position yesterday. He obtained significant voting results 
yesterday. The decision as to whether or not he decides to 
cooperate, whether or not he deems it advisable for the position 
he has opened to engage or not in my administration depends, 
first of all, on the analysis they make of what their 
relationship should be with the government. For my part, I am 
ready to consider the decision they make, whether it be to 
remain in the opposition or to engage in working in a government 
of national unity, in view of the important number of votes 
obtained by both candidates yesterday. 
  [Announcer] Thank you Dr. Samper, we invite you to stay with 
us. We will continue to analyze yesterday's elections. The 
principal novelty yesterday was the high voter turnout. It was 
the highest voter turnout recorded in presidential elections in 
Colombia. Contrary to all the predictions that there would be 
increased abstentionism, 7.3 million Colombians went to vote. 
Abstentionism dropped from 66 percent in the primary elections 
to approximately 50 percent. That is 2 million votes more than 
on 29 May. These votes were distributed fairly, equally between 
the two candidates because the difference was 120,000 votes. 
This newscast consulted several newsmen to find out what they 
expect of Samper's administration and how they will judge him. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter] What do you expect of Ernesto 
Samper's administration? 
  [Columnist Jorge Child] I hope he will fulfill two basic 
promises. The one on social investment to increase jobs and the 
one on Latin American integration, which includes, of course, 
Cuba's admission to the OAS. 
  [Columnist Maria Teresa Herran] I hope that he will fulfill 
his campaign promises. 
  [Columnist Juan Gabrial Uribe] Yes, I think that Dr. Ernesto 
Samper can lead a good peace-keeping process in Colombia. 
  [Reporter] How will you carry out your watchdog activities 
of 
his government? 
  [Child] If he strays from his promises, if he engages in 
influence peddling, if he does not keep his promises to suspend 
privatizations, if he is not successful in his social policy, we 
will most certainly organize an opposition movement. 
  [Herran] He has promised to create [words indistinct] jobs. 
We will have to conduct a follow-up on how they are going to be 
created and how many will be created the first year. 
  [Uribe] We will conduct watchdog activities to ensure that 
what he has said about a fight against corruption is fulfilled. 
[end recording] 
  [Announcer] Well, Dr. Samper, you have heard that the 
columnists are going to keep an eye on you to see whether you 
fulfill your campaign promises, particularly the fight against 
corruption and your promise to create jobs. What is your answer 
to them? 
  [Samper] Basically, that I am disposed as a government 
leader 
to give them all the guarantees they require to conduct their 
watchdog activities. I think what a government needs most is a 
free and independent press, which can closely follow all 
government actions. I am very pleased with what the important 
columnists have said. 
  [Valderama] Well, Dr. Samper, the last question for you is 
what will be the first actions of your government on 8 August? 
  [Samper] On 7 August. [laughs] In addition to appointing the 
cabinet, I am thinking of promulgating some decrees to 
reactivate the agricultural sector because I have an affective 
and effective commitment to the recovery of that sector. 
  [Valderama] Thank you very much, Dr. Ernesto Samper, 
Colombian president-elect. This has been all the information we 
have from the home of Dr. Ernesto Samper.

  [Text] Carlos Menem traveled to Canada on 19 June. The 
purpose of his three-day visit is to increase trade between the 
two nations. 
  The president arrived at the metropolitan airport's military 
section at 1915 -- shortly after the soccer game between Mexico 
and Norway -- on board a helicopter, and 10 minutes later 
boarded the plane without talking to the press. 
  The list of the 32 passengers flying with the president in 
the Tango-1 plane was not revealed. But it was known that 
Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella, Air Force Commander Juan 
Paulik, Economic Relations Secretary Jorge Campbell, Agriculture 
Secretary Felipe Sola, presidential physician Alejandro Tfeli, 
hair dresser Antonio Cuozzo, and about 20 entrepreneurs traveled 
with him. 
  An interesting note was the absence of Santa Cruz Governor 
Nestor Kirchner. "We have been waiting for him since early 
today, but he did not even call to tell us he was not coming," a 
presidential protocol department official complained. 
  Menem will meet with economists and politicians in Canada. 
He 
and Prime Minister Jean Chretien will sign an agreement to avoid 
the double payment of taxes on private companies' incomes and 
capital and an agreement on cooperation for the peaceful use of 
nuclear energy. 
  But the main item on his agenda will undoubtedly be 
Argentina's entry into NAFTA -- much more because he knows the 
Latin American country that will most likely join NAFTA first is 
Chile. 
  Both the Argentine president and Felipe Sola will not forget 
to discuss the national government's concern over the sale of 
subsidized grains to Brazil. 
  The president will stay at the residence of Governor General 
Raymond Hatishin while in Ottawa.

<F P=106> [From Teodomiro Braga's column "JB Report"] </F>
  [Text] The Brazilian Government has canceled the visit of 
Argentine Economy Minister Domingos Cavallo in retaliation for 
President Menem's position during the ceremony closing the 
Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena on 15 June. 
  Itamaraty deemed "offensive" and "inelegant" Menem's 
initiative to request support for Mexican President Carlos 
Salinas' candidacy for the presidency of the future World Trade 
Organization, ignoring Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero's 
candidacy for the same position. 
  Brazilian Ambassador to Buenos Aires Marcos Azambuja was 
instructed on the night of 16 June to tell the Argentine 
Government about the decision to cancel Cavallo's visit to 
Brasilia on 27 and 28 June. His visit would express support for 
the implementation of the real. 
  Winston Fritsch from the Finance Ministry and Jose Denot 
Medeiros from Itamaraty left for Buenos Aires on 16 June at 
night to convey Brazil's perplexity about the Argentine 
president's haste to Argentine officials. 
  Itamaraty deemed Menem's attitude unacceptable, particularly 
because the Argentine Government had been informed a week before 
about Ricupero's candidacy to the presidency of the organization 
that will replace GATT. 
  In addition to overlooking this fact, Menem committed 
another 
blunder by asking the chiefs of state to acclaim Salinas' 
candidacy. President Itamar Franco's seat was empty because he 
had suddenly left Cartagena and returned to Brazil.

  [Editorial Report] Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in 
Portuguese on 12 June publishes on page 8 an unattributed 
1,500-word article on the opinions of Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva 
-- presidential candidate for the Workers Party, PT, and the 
coalition of the Brazilian Socialist Party, the Communist Party 
of Brazil, the Popular Socialist Party, the Unified Socialist 
Workers Party, the Green Party, and the Brazilian Communist 
Party -- Fernando Henrique Cardoso -- presidential candidate for 
the Brazilian Social Democracy Party and the coalition of the 
Liberal Front Party and the Brazilian Labor Party -- Orestes 
Quercia -- presidential candidate for the Brazilian Democratic 
Movement Party -- Esperidiao Amin -- presidential candidate for 
the Progressive Renewal Party -- and Leonel Brizola -- 
presidential candidate for the Democratic Labor Party -- on the 
importance of agrarian reform, what type of agrarian reform they 
would implement if elected, and what they think of the Landless 
People's Movement. 
  According to the article, Lula says that if Brazil had 
implemented a good agrarian reform there would not have been 
land occupation; good agrarian reform must begin with a survey 
to determine the amount of unproductive land in each county and 
grant subsidized credit, technical assistance, transportation, 
and a guaranteed minimum price for produce. The article adds 
that Lula believes the Landless People's Movement has done 
important things in Brazil and that land occupied by the 
landless farmers produces more than the average property. 
  The article reports Cardoso as believing that, within the 
framework of production and the creation of jobs, agrarian 
reform is a priority; that more should be done and less should 
be said, particularly because such a reform must be complemented 
by irrigation projects, electricity to rural areas, agricultural 
credit, and technical assistance. He says his "administration 
plans to irrigate 1.5 million hectares per year," and "the 
landless farmers are victims of an unfair concentration of land 
and the PT's radicalism, which prevented the approval during the 
1988 Constituent Assembly of a modern and fair agrarian reform." 
  Quercia says: "Agrarian reform is an essential aspect of my 
government plan; we will create agricultural colonies and towns 
with a good transportation system nearby. Federal government 
land as well as expropriated land will be used to settle the 
landless farmers. Some 16,000 families are registered in the 
Landless People's Movement. This is not too much, and their 
problem can be solved fast. Therefore, politicization of the 
movement is irrelevant because the problem is solved if the 
landless farmers are given land." 
  Amin says: "An agricultural policy is a priority, and the 
agrarian reform its result, but the requirements of such a 
reform change in accordance with the region of the country in 
which the reform is to be implemented. The main basis of this 
policy is financing, which the farmer will pay for in grain. In 
the north, northeast, and central-west regions the government 
must implement settlement programs on unproductive land." The 
article adds that in Amin's opinion, "the Landless People's 
Movement is a result of the government decision to expropriate 
land only after it is occupied, thus making people who want land 
-- not only the landless farmers -- participate in the 
occupations. This is why the movement ended up being linked to 
the PT and the Sole Workers Center, which believe the government 
only implements agrarian reform under pressure." 
  Brizola says: "A settlement program has always been a 
priority for us. The Constitution only defines land as being 
productive or unproductive. The issue, however, is more complex 
and other aspects of it must be considered. If a lot of land is 
used only for speculation, the government should expropriate it 
and pay for it with agrarian debt certificates. The Landless 
People's Movement has been manipulated for political-electoral 
reasons by some PT groups and by some priests."

  [Text] Barbadians will go to the polls on 6 September this 
year. Governor General Dame Nita Barrow made the announcement on 
Saturday. The election announcement followed several days of 
widespread speculation on Prime Minister Erskine Sandiford's 
political future after he lost a no-confidence motion on the 
seventh of June. Opposition Barbados Labor Party leader Owen 
Arthur welcomed news of the poll, saying there was no way the 
country's political crisis could go on any further. 
  [Begin Arthur recording] A deep and bitter division within 
the Democratic Labor Party as regards the best person to succeed 
Mr. Sandiford in the event that he has stepped down. [Words 
indistinct] had a person been appointed in his place could have 
called herself the [word indistinct] administration. That could 
not work. [Words indistinct] Barbados have been spared the agony 
of having a government that is unworkable and could only cause 
anarchy. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, Mr. Arthur added that his party is ready, 
willing, 
and able to contest the elections and he also commented on the 
political future of (MP DeLyle Bradshaw) who missed the vote on 
the no-confidence motion. 
  [Begin Arthur recording] [Passage indistinct] rules is a 
democratic institution and our rules require that Mr. Bradshaw 
should be given the opportunity to answer to the party and to be 
tried in its presence if there is to be a trial. That process 
has not yet been gone through and therefore, I am not going to 
say anything that would be prejudicial to the case that Mr. 
Bradshaw may put, or would be prejudicial to the question as to 
whether or not he would be a candidate. [end recording]

  [Text] Today, the so-called North American Development Bank 
(Nadbank), an institution created within the framework of the 
North American Free Trade Agreement [NAFTA] was formally 
created. The fundamental objective of this new institution will 
be to manage funds that are earmarked for social and 
environmental improvement projects to be implemented along the 
border between Mexico and the United States. 
  Finance Secretary Pedro Aspe and U.S. Treasury Secretary 
Lloyd Bentsen presided over the signing ceremony as well as the 
Nadbank's first Board of Directors meeting. The signing 
ceremony took place before numerous Mexican and U.S. business 
representatives at the San Antonio Convention Center. Secretary 
Aspe commented on the joint efforts by each nation's government 
to improve environmental and infrastructure conditions along the 
common border. 
  U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who was selected as 
president of the Nadbank's Board of Directors, called on the 
private sector to participate in the development of the projects 
proposed. The Nadbank will initially operate under a 10-year 
plan that encompasses projects totalling nearly $18 billion and 
will combine private as well as public resources. 
  Also present during the signing ceremony were Mexican 
Finance 
Deputy Secretary Guillermo Ortiz and Erminio Blanco, under 
secretary for international trade negotiations of the Commerce 
and Industrial Development, among other officials representing 
both nations.

<F P=106> [Report on a statement by Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal in </F>
response to a fishing boat incident in Nicaraguan waters in the 
Pacific Ocean with a patrol boat of the Costa Rican Navy; from 
the "Events" newscast] 
  [Text] [Begin Leal recording] We have no explanation to 
give. We uphold the position this incident is totally 
unacceptable and is even more unacceptable now that the 
presidents, with a clear, political willingness, have decided on 
the procedure to follow concerning the incursions in territorial 
waters of another nation. 
  In this case, the report I have from our Navy is that the 
fishing boat was in Nicaraguan waters, and, subsequently, there 
was a violation of our sovereignty. This is an incident that 
seriously reflects a lack of information. This boat was 
undoubtedly in Nicaraguan waters. 
  We consider this a hostile action by the Costa Rican C-105 
patrol boat. This is the second time this patrol boat has been 
involved in this type of action. We had a problem with that 
same Costa Rica patrol boat the last time 
  Our Navy acted as it should, with great caution. One person, 
Seaman Benito Quintanilla, was wounded. We have not presented 
our protest to the Costa Rican authorities. We demand, however, 
an immediate meeting, because this situation must end. This 
type of situation should never happen again. We want this 
patrol boat to be investigated. We have had problems with that 
patrol boat several times. 
  We have contacted the Costa Rican authorities, and we will 
hold a meeting as soon as possible to clarify this type of 
problem once and for all. [end recording] 
  The foreign minister has said no official reply has been 
received yet from the Costa Rican Government, which is engaged 
in an ongoing investigation of the incident. 
  [Panama City ACAN in Spanish at 1919 GMT on 18 June reports: 
"Following a shoot-out in its waters of the Pacific Ocean, the 
Nicaraguan Naval Coast Guard today rescued the `No Solar,' a

<F P=106> [Article by Carlos Vargas] </F>
  [Text] Comptroller General Jose Chen Barria yesterday 
rejected the possibility that the government would declare a 
national foreign debt moratorium to face the consequences of the 
1994 budget cuts totalling $198 million. 
  The comptroller general made his statement before the 
legislature's Budget Commission after Christian Democratic Party 
legislator Gabriel Arosemena asked him about the possibility 
that the government would declare a national moratorium to delay 
payments to the IFIS [international financial institutions] and 
would use those funds to compensate for the budget cuts. 
  Chen Barria emphatically denied such steps would be taken 
and 
he warned a national moratorium declaration would result in 
worse conditions than those trying to be resolved with the 
budget cuts. 
  The comptroller general indicated that 37 cents of every 
dollar that enters the public treasury is earmarked for IFIS 
payments. Chen Barria warned that Panama is a country which 
needs foreign credits to make investments because it cannot 
accomplish much with its internal savings. 
  The comptroller general met with members of the legislative 
commission to evaluate the consequences of the budget cuts that 
were made as a result of the delay in disbursements by the IFIS. 
The disbursements were delayed because Panama has not met the 
IFI's demands. 
  After reaching an agreement with the comptroller general, 
the 
budget commission decided to suspend a move to reject the budget 
cuts until a meeting with ministers and other cabinet members is 
held. 
  Legislators will meet with members of the executive branch 
to 
seek alternatives to save some investment projects in the 
districts, a sector which suffered a drastic $46.5 million 
cutback. 
  Chen Barria said the legislators should first establish 
which 
district projects are most important and then meet with 
ministers and agency directors to determine if they can make 
adjustments within their remaining budget to carry out some of 
these district projects.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 17 Jun (EFE) -- According to remarks 
by Argentine Foreign Trade Secretary Carlos Kesman, great 
strides were made at the meeting of vice economy ministers of 
Common Market of the South [Mercosur] member countries that 
ended on 17 June. 
  Kesman did not make any concrete announcements about the 
progress made at the meeting. He just stated that it was a 
"working meeting" and therefore nobody expected any changes to 
what had been agreed to by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and 
Uruguay. 
  The analysis of all the pending points on the common 
external 
tariff (AEC) was among the most salient issue discussed in the 
nearly eight-hour-long meeting at the Economy Ministry building 
in Buenos Aires. 
  Kesman also highlighted the controversy between Argentina 
and 
Brazil over capital goods in general and computer software and 
hardware in particular. He nonetheless denied reports about an 
alleged "flexibility" evinced by Brazilian authorities. 
  The four countries' representatives also analyzed aspects 
pertaining to the establishment of free trade zones and the 
reconciliation of tax policies. 
  The Argentine delegation was headed by Carlos Sanchez, the 
trade and investment secretary, and Jorge Campbell, the under 
secretary for commercial integration, who were accompanied by 
Kesman and Alejandro Mayoral, the under secretary for sectorial 
programming and integration. 
  Also attending the meeting were [Economic Policy Secretary] 
Winston Fritch from Brazil -- Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero's 
right-hand man, Economy and Finance Under Secretary Juan Ignacio 
Garcia Peluffo from Uruguay, and Integration Vice Minister Ruben 
Fadlala from Paraguay.

  [Text] A trade agreement between Caricom and Colombia would 
allow some Caricom producers duty-free access to the Colombian 
market for four years. Trinidad and Tobago's Foreign Affairs 
Minister Ralph Maraj believes that the twin republic could be 
one of the principal beneficiaries. Caricom heads are expected 
to sign the agreement when they meet in Barbados in July. 
Minister Maraj says that while NAFTA will also be high on the 
agenda, efforts to bring about a Caricom single market must 
continue at least for now. Nicole Huggins tells us more: 
  [Begin recording] [Huggins] The trade agreement between 
Caricom and Colombia will allow some Caricom producers duty-free 
access to the Colombian market and a fees reduction of up to 33 
and a third percent of duty on other goods. Foreign Affairs 
Minister Ralph Maraj says this is similar to the agreement which 
already exists between Caricom and Venezuela. 
  [Maraj] It is an improved agreement, even though you have 
reciprocity, and I think that view is shared by the experts in 
the field as well as the businessmen who will now be seeking to 
take advantage of this agreement. 
  [Huggins] After four years, Caricom countries would be 
required to provide reciprocal access to Colombian products. 
Caricom heads are expected to sign the agreement when they meet 
in Barbados in July. Also on the heads of government's agenda 
are studies of the North American Free Trade Agreement and its 
possible impact on Caricom countries. Although countries such 
as Trinidad and Tobago have already applied for individual entry 
into NAFTA, Minister Maraj insists it is not too late for a 
regional approach. 
  [Maraj] I think there was a wisdom in the effects of 
[passage 
indistinct], and I think that that is now commonly accepted, and 
I feel that as you say, we will have an even more, well a more 
certain and [word indistinct] approach to the whole matter. We 
also need to get more information as we engage in the 
negotiating process, which is to come at a later point in time. 
And once we have that information, it will strengthen our 
position to do justice to ourselves. 
  [Huggins] The heads will also continue work on a common 
Caricom currency, an integral part of the proposed single 
market. Given the uncertainty of NAFTA, Minister Maraj says this 
subregional effort must continue. [end recording]

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 17 Jun (NA) -- President Carlos Menem 
on 17 June implicitly condemned North Korea's position of 
keeping its nuclear program secret. He said: "The largest world 
powers are making a considerable effort to prevent a small 
country from causing a true holocaust on the planet." 
  Without mentioning the Asian country, Menem said: "It is a 
small country, which went practically unnoticed in the past few 
years, that has embarked on intensive development of nuclear 
energy, and has obviously built atomic bombs that can cause 
grave damage to the planet." 
  The president emphasized: "We Argentines work for life while 
others work for death." 
  Menem made these remarks during the inauguration and 
beginning of operation of the plant for cyclotron-produced 
radioisotopes for medical use [planta de produccion de ciclotron 
de radioisotopos de uso medico] in the Ezeiza Atomic Center. 
  The plant has state-of-the-art German equipment and will 
permit the manufacturing of products vital in modern medicine. 
It will reduce costs and permit the use of these products in 
hospitals located far from urban centers. Radioisotopes are 
radioactive atoms with a nucleus with a different mass. Their 
use in improving living conditions is increasingly diverse. They 
are useful in increasing the yield of vegetables, preserving 
food, sterilizing medical products, conducting hormone analysis, 
using X-ray tubes in the control of industrial processes, or 
studying environmental contamination. 
  Menem was accompanied by Manuel Mondino, head of the 
National 
Commission for Atomic Energy (CNEA), and Buenos Aires Production 
Minister Carlos Brown and Public Works Minister Hugo Toledo. 
  Menem made a list of CNEA achievements and then added that 
"some countries develop nuclear energy for death. We Argentines 
have been working for life ever since we began operating in this 
area 44 years ago, perhaps a little more, under the inspiration 
of General Juan Domingo Peron." 
  Menem added: "There are two countries with this type of 
development in the Southern Hemisphere: Australia and 
Argentina." 
  "When you work on atoms you realize that they can be used 
not 
only for medical purposes but also for production to improve all 
types of activities in rural areas such as agriculture and 
livestock or pest eradication and control. We work on these 
aspects here and we are at the same level as the world's other 
great countries."

  [Text] The Conaie [Confederation of Indian Nationalities of 
Ecuador] continues to paralyze the mountain provinces of the 
mountain range. The shortage of basic staples is apparent there. 
Conaie representative (Nina Pacari) said that her organization 
has nothing to do with abuses and violence committed on the 
streets. She maintains that paramilitary groups hired by the 
regime, the Social Christian Party, and the Republican Unity 
Party, burned peasant organization headquarters and killed 
Indians. 
  [Begin (Pacari) recording, in progress] ...the entire 
country, especially between the Andean region and Cotopaxi 
Province, and the Amazonian areas of the Provinces of Pastaza 
and Napo are completely paralyzed. The country's Indian and 
peasant movement has intensified its actions to protest against 
this agricultural law. We want to denounce repression in several 
provinces, deaths and injuries, and, especially, attacks on the 
headquarters of our provincial organizations. 
  We blame the national government for this because it is 
behind the evil actions of paramilitary groups against our 
companeros and leaders nationwide. We must point out that 
paramilitary groups killed companero (Marcos Marabanda) in 
Tungurahua Province, where a pickup truck fired indiscriminately 
and sped away. Also, Radio Centro was fired on by paramilitary 
groups that fled. [end recording] 
  Conaie will continue its actions until the regime repeals 
the 
agricultural law. (Pacari) pointed out that it is preferable for 
the country to lose hundreds of millions of Sucres now as a 
result of the paralysis than to lose the entire agricultural 
sector, because of a law that brings absolutely no benefits for 
Indians and peasants.

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 13 Jun (EFE) -- On 13 June, 
Chilean President Eduardo Frei said he had come to the Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit to "reassert Chile's Latin American 
spirit," a basic issue in its foreign policy. 
  Frei recalled that during his presidential electoral 
campaign, he stated that Latin America would be the main issue 
in his foreign policy with prospects for political and economic 
integration. He added that he has continued to uphold and put 
this into practice since he came to power on 11 March. 
  Frei told EFE: "It is true that Chile is a country open to 
the world, that it is going to join the South Pacific Economic 
Cooperation Conference (APEC), and that the EU is our main 
commercial partner, but, regardless of this, Chile has a Latin 
American spirit and we have come to reassert this." 
  Frei added that sound evidence of this are the recent 
proposals for a partnership with the Common Market of the South 
(Mercosur) and the proposals Chile made during the recent OAS 
General Assembly in Brazil. 
  Upon joining the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, which will 
last two days in Cartagena de Indias, he said Chile will 
participate with the hope -- "and will make every effort 
possible in this direction" -- that it will mark the starting 
point, "in practice rather than in theory," of a real 
integration of the hemisphere. 
  The summit "must be the forum that will ensure Latin 
America's transformation into a true community of nations in 
which support for democracy, human rights, the struggle to 
overcome poverty, and economic integration prevail." 
  In Frei's opinion, the main thing to attaining these goals 
is 
commercial opening through negotiated agreements "with a spirit 
of open regionalism" that will cast aside protectionism and 
grant the continent access to the major markets, "free of 
exclusions and closed blocs." 
  The Chilean chief of state stressed: "This is what we have 
come to propose at this Fourth Ibero-American Summit, and we 
will do so with determination and an American spirit." 
  Upon his arrival in Cartagena de Indias, Frei offered 
Chile's 
cooperation in rebuilding the towns of Caucas and Huilas, which 
were devastated last week by the landslide caused by a tremor. 
Frei reconfirmed this offer to EFE. 
  Chile has already shipped 200 metric tons of aid for the 
tragedy's victims, but Frei said: "We have talked to the 
Colombian authorities about cooperating in the most difficult 
aspects, that is, to rebuild the towns." Frei added: 
"Unfortunately, Chile has great experience in natural disasters 
and will place this experience at the service of our Colombian 
brothers." 
  Shortly after his arrival, the Chilean president held a 
bilateral meeting with King Juan Carlos of Spain, whom he 
invited to visit Chile again, specifically the Antarctic, which 
is one of the king's "great desires." 
  The respective foreign ministries will immediately start 
working on the initiative to set a date, according to Frei, who 
said he had asked for an audience with the king "for the 
affection and support he always has granted Chile." 
  Eduardo Frei is scheduled to hold two more bilateral 
meetings 
in Cartagena de Indias: one with Bolivian President Gonzalo 
Sanchez de Lozada on 15 June and one with Cuban President Fidel 
Castro on 16 June. 
  Frei said the two meetings will have an open agenda to 
assess 
the state of bilateral relations and cooperation prospects, but 
dismissed the possibilities that an agreement to resume 
diplomatic relations will be reached during either of the two 
meetings.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 21 Jun (EFE) -- The military that 
toppled Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide must receive 
"some guarantees" for themselves and their relatives within the 
pact to resolve the crisis in Haiti, Dominican Deputy Foreign 
Minister Fabio Herrera Cabral said today. 
  Herrera Cabral said that sending the Haitian military to 
diplomatic posts "so they could be quiet there" could be a 
solution. He said a solution to the Haitian crisis, however, 
"depends on Haitians themselves resolving their problems, on the 
patriotism of Haitians, on the flexibility of Aristide since he 
is part of the crisis." 
  The Dominican official added: "Each one has to do his share, 
yield a little." To achieve a political resolution, one has to 
yield part of his sovereignty, what he believes to be his 
personal interests. Herrera Cabral justified the U.S Government 
position of negotiating the stepping down of the Haitian 
military without need of a military intervention. 
  Regarding the list of food and medicines that Haiti will be 
allowed to import through the border with the Dominican 
Republic, he explained there is no "list" since UN Resolution 
917 allows humanitarian assistance. 
  Yesterday, Monday, Dante Caputo, special UN and OAS envoy 
for 
the Haitian crisis, handed Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer 
a UN Security Council grantee, allowing food and medicine to 
enter Haiti from this country.

  [Excerpts] Port-au-Prince, 21 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Haiti's de 
facto government has affirmed its determination to confront a 
military invasion at a time when a U.S. senator visiting the 
island has indicated that the Haitian Army could not possibly 
repel an invasion. [passage omitted] 
  U.S. Senator Robert Graham, at the end of a brief visit to 
the Caribbean nation, said, "The Haitian Army could not repel an 
international intervention." [passage omitted] 
  Haitian Senator Bernard Sansaricq, a supporter of the de 
facto government, said Graham "is attempting to provoke a civil 
war. Can you imagine? He even went to Cite Soleil (stronghold 
of Aristide supporters) to meet with members of popular 
organizations." 
  Sansaricq, leader of the parliamentary faction that supports 
the military, also said Graham "wants to polarize the situation. 
He should never have come here." [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, a source close to the government confirmed the 
Army could be having serious internal problems. He made his 
statements after confirming that two soldiers were killed in 
their garrisons on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince during 
incidents that still have not been officially disclosed.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 21 Jun (EFE) -- Frantz Robert Monde, 
president of the Haitian Chamber of Deputies, today criticized 
the U.S. plan to establish a radio station on a ship in 
international waters off the coast of Hispaniola Island to urge 
Haiti's military leaders to relinquish power. Monde said it is 
immoral for U.S. President Bill Clinton to expect Haitian 
soldiers to stage an uprising against their generals. According 
to the legislator, the United States "knows" that the soldiers, 
not the generals, staged the coup that toppled constitutional 
President Jean Bertrand Aristide in September 1991. To explain 
the alleged immorality of Clinton's position, Monde said it is 
as if the United States were to encourage U.S. Marines "who are 
not homosexuals to rise up against Marines who are." 
  Meanwhile, former Senate President Dejean Belizaire said the 
issue of exile for the military is a form of bait. "We must not 
lose the country's sovereignty," Belizaire said. 
  The right-wing organization "Capois La Mort" said, regarding 
the establishment of the U.S. radio station, that the Armed 
Forces should not "yield to blackmail." 
  Likewise, according to Monde, the mission of Duly Brutus, 
former president of the Chamber of Deputies, and Deputy Datus 
Milcent, who traveled to Washington on Sunday as guests of the 
"Heritage Foundation," is to denounce the plan to invade Haiti 
and prove the "negative influence" William Gray, Clinton's 
adviser on the Haitian crisis, has had on U.S.-Haitian policy. 
Brutus and Milcent will meet with three former U.S. secretaries 
of state and members of Congress during their visit to 
Washington. 
  "Gray has no credibility to negotiate the crisis the country 
is experiencing because of the circumstances under which he left 
Congress," Monde argued, although he did not mention what the 
motives were. In his opinion, Gray "hides under President 
Aristides' table and obeys every word he says." " 
  On the other hand, since this past Monday, the Haitian banks 
began to apply one of the measures imposed by the U.S. 
Government by limiting the delivery of funds sent by Haitians 
from their relatives living in the United States to $40. This 
measure has caused dissatisfaction among the Haitians who 
survive on the funds their relatives send. In addition, the 
Haitian banks advised their clients that they could no longer 
use credit card services. 
  On the other hand, the "Haiti Trans Air" airlines, which has 
regular flights between Port-au-Prince and Miami, announced 
today that its last flight to U.S. territory would be on 24 June 
as a result of the measures adopted by President Clinton, who 
unilaterally decided to suspend flights between both nations. 
With Haitian Trans Air discontinuing flights, a measure also to 
be supported shortly by "American Airlines," only "Air France" 
will cover the Port-au-Prince journey, with a stopover on 
Guadeloupe island, three times a week, and to Santo Domingo once 
a week. 
  As result of the situation, hundreds of travelers remain in 
the Port-au-Prince airport trying to arrange a flight out of the 
country before the commercial flight suspension declared by 
President Clinton enters into effect this weekend. 
  Similarly, Emmanuelle Constant, head of the Front for 
Haiti's 
Advance and Progress (FRAPH), reiterated today that the 
foreigners currently in Haiti are in no danger. According to 
Constant, the majority of those foreigners are still in the 
country and have not heeded the calls to abandon Haiti made by 
the United States and Canada, which he believes is evidence that 
they are not in any danger.

surprise us as the Haitian political crisis continues. 
Following reports that some republicans plan to move President 
Aristide to La Gonave Island, the latest news is that U.S. 
officials intend to move a ship that is carrying propaganda 
against the military putschists into Haitian waters. The 
propaganda reportedly aims to force noncommissioned officers and 
soldiers to take up arms against Generals Cedras and Biamby and 
Michel Francois. 
  Chamber of Deputies President Frantz Robert Monde is not 
pleased. The deputy says it would be immoral for the U.S. 
Government to stir up trouble inside the Army and a civil war in 
Haiti. Frantz Robert Monde asks: Can we ask straight Marines to 
rise up against their gay colleagues? 
  [Begin recording] [Monde] This is like those men planning to 
have Aristide go to La Gonave, like those men saying that there 
must be intervention in Haiti. "Those men want to 
sensationalize." Can you imagine a radio station (?being set 
up) in the harbor, calling for soldiers to rise up? The 
soldiers want to destroy them, as well. I will take the 
hardline position whenever they take such a position. 
  [Valet] They say they guarantee that nothing will happen to 
those who rise up against the generals, that they will do 
nothing to the police or soldiers. 
  [Monde] They know they are lying to the little soldiers. 
They know they will destroy the little soldiers because they 
know that the little soldiers staged the coup d'etat. They know 
very well that it was not the generals. "They go through the 
generals to get to the little soldiers." I have never discussed 
my position on Cedras, but "I am opposed to getting rid of the 
entire Army high command in favor of Aristide. It is out of the 
question." [passage omitted] 
  "Can we ask a Marine who has more or less morality to rise 
up 
against his president?" It would be immoral for the United 
States to do that. They do not have this right. "Stirring up 
trouble and civil war in Haiti and arousing army against army is 
not a responsible position. Can we ask straight U.S. Marines to 
rise up against gay Marines? No, it is out of the question." 
[end recording] 
  The Chamber of Deputies president says that Duly Brutus and 
Datus Milcent have gone to Washington to discuss the Haitian 
political crisis with the Republicans and the Democrats. Bob 
Monde says these legislators will denounce the U.S. invasion 
plans and William Gray's behavior during the Haitian crisis: 
  [Begin Monde recording] I asked them to denounce and fight 
the intervention issue. Second, I asked them to stress Gray's 
negative influence on U.S. policy toward Haiti. Gray left 
Congress for shady reasons and is not credible enough to 
negotiate a crisis today. Gray has managed to secure the job of 
President Clinton's representative. Unfortunately, he only 
remains under Aristide's table. He listens to and only repeats 
all that Aristide says. We do not have many options with Gray. 
The only option is intervention. You see, "this is the 
reaction of the negro who has not yet freed himself from the 
influence of his environment." I think this is very grave. We 
have no chance of emerging from this crisis when a man like this 
is involved. [end recording] 
  As for the upcoming 25 June deadline, the Chamber of 
Deputies 
president says Haitians must resign themselves to the economic 
sanctions. he asks them, however, to cope with the embargo. He 
also wants negotiations to resume. Apparently, this call for 
negotiations will not have (?the desired results) since all the 
protagonists are preparing to (?fight). The de facto family's 
song is: Grenadiers, to the assault! We do not care about 
those of us who might die! [grenadye alaso, sa ki mouri zafe a 
yo]

<F P=106> [Interview with Chamber of Deputies President Frantz Robert </F>
Monde by correspondent Edner Jean in Port-au-Prince; date not 
given; Monde and Jean speak in Creole; first paragraph 
announcer-read introduction -- recorded] 
  [Text] Some new diplomatic steps are being taken to solve 
the political crisis. Two Haitian deputies, including 
legislators from the Nationalistic Progressive Revolutionary 
Party of Haiti and from the socialist group contacted by the 
Heritage Foundation, arrived in Washington on 19 June to meet 
U.S. democratic and republican congressmen. Haitian Deputies 
Duly Brutus and Datus Milcent will return to Port-au-Prince on 
23 June. A Chamber of Deputies Office press release asks other 
legislators not to travel abroad in the interest of reserving, 
for the legislature, those decisions that only the legislature 
can make. It should be noted that recently, legislators 
denounced the authorities banning about 15 deputies from leaving 
Port-au-Prince airport, which the Chamber Office has denied. 
Chamber of Deputies President Frantz Robert Monde explains: 
  [Monde] The Heritage Foundation invited me and Deputy Duly 
Brutus to Washington for a five-day visit to improve their view 
and assessment of the Haitian crisis. My departure alarmed some 
deputies and politicians, so I stayed and sent Deputy Datus 
Milcent in my place. The meetings began this morning. Meetings 
with the Heritage Foundation and with democratic and republican 
legislators have been fruitful. 
  [Jean] What is the Heritage Foundation? 
  [Monde] A very conservative group, along the lines of the 
Center for Democracy. The Heritage Foundation is conservative 
and oriented toward the Republicans, while the Center for 
Democracy is oriented toward the Democrats. The Foundation has 
a very solid U.S. foreign policy reputation. It supports a 
better approach to the Haitian crisis. 
  [Jean] So you think that the Chamber of Deputies has been 
represented fairly? Do you think that this delegation 
represents all of the factions? It does not include any 
National Front for Change and Democracy members. 
  [Monde] The Chamber sends delegations for different reasons. 
The Chamber would normally send a delegation representing the 
various factions. In this case, Deputies Frantz Robert Monde 
and Duly Brutus received personal invitations. There is a big 
difference. It would not have been diplomatic for me to receive 
an invitation and then invite someone else. The deputies know 
this for they encounter the same thing. If they invite one 
deputy, another cannot tag along. That is not done. 
  [Jean] What do you expect from these negotiations? Do you 
think they can influence the political juncture? 
  [Monde] They are meeting high-level people. They will meet 
three former U.S. secretaries of state, people at Warren 
Christopher's level. They will meet some current and former 
U.S. congressmen. It is best to wait for the two deputies to 
return. We will not find a solution on the streets. The two 
deputies are competent and able. They are of good faith. They 
want to solve the crisis and to find an honorable solution for 
all the parties in the crisis. That is why they went. In 
particular, they will defend against those Americans who think 
they can intervene in Haiti.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 21 Jun (AFP) -- Tuesday night, the 
Ministry of Information, Coordination, and Culture announced 
that hereafter foreign journalists must "request and obtain" 
from that Ministry authorization to go to the cities in the 
provinces. 
  The objective of the measure is "to guarantee the security 
of 
foreign journalists in the country," the communique notes. Many 
foreign journalists, including the crews of the principal U.S. 
television stations, are in Port-au-Prince just as the new U.S. 
sanctions are to be enforced.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 21 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Today, coupist 
Haitian officers intensified their actions to defend against a 
possible military intervention to reestablish democracy in this 
Caribbean nation. Today, the de facto government ordered 
barricades of sand bags be erected in the area surrounding the 
National Palace and General Headquarters. 
  Meanwhile, Emmanuel Constant, leader of the paramilitary 
group Front for Haiti's Advance and Progress (FRAPH), announced 
that on Friday they will begin a strike to protest the possible 
U.S. intervention. He said the group, which changed its name to 
the Haitian People's Armed Revolutionary Front, will stage the 
measure against U.S. President William Clinton, William Gray, 
his adviser for the Haitian crisis, and deposed Haitian 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
  FRAPH patrolled the streets of the capital last October to 
prevent any activity after declaring a strike to protest the 
return of Aristide, which was scheduled for 30 October in 
compliance with the Governor's Island Agreement. Followers of 
the military protested the U.S. Government's intention to 
disseminate antimilitary propaganda from planes in a two-week 
period, like they did in Panama and Iraq. 
  Robert Monde, president of the Chamber of Deputies and 
confidant of the coupist officers, said "that is immoral... they 
want to cause a civil war... the military High Command is not 
responsible for the coup... it was organized by soldiers." 
  Meanwhile, sources at the U.S. Embassy in Haiti said that 
more than half of the diplomatic mission's personnel and their 
dependents have left the country, four days before the 
suspension of commercial flights to Haiti goes into effect. 
This measure is part of the nearly total embargo decreed since 
22 May to pressure military officers into relinquishing power 
and allowing the return of Aristide.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 21 Jun (EFE) -- The Front for 
Haiti's Advance and Progress (FRAPH) announced today that it 
would start a general strike next Friday, 24 June, to protest 
U.S. policies against Haiti and to practice voodoo to exorcise 
the invasion. 
  FRAPH leader Emmanuel Constant confirmed that the group 
changed its name to People's Armed Revolutionary Front this 
Tuesday, and he criticized what he called was the 
Clinton-Aristide-Gray policy. Constant was referring to U.S. 
President Bill Clinton; Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the Haitian 
president who was toppled in September 1991; and William Gray, 
the U.S. President's adviser for the Haitian crisis. 
  Constant, however, clarified at a news conference this 
afternoon, that the name, People's Armed Revolutionary Front, 
does not mean the organization will take up arms due to U.S. 
military intervention threats. He explained that the members of 
the organization are to be relief personnel who will be deployed 
to strategic areas and await the Armed Forces' requests. 
  Constant commented that the Front's members will have 
machetes and will use magic, voodoo, and the "Ouanga" (object 
used in voodoo practices to show special powers). The 
right-wing leader indicated that they will use those powers to 
protect the country from a foreign invasion. 
  Louis Jodell Chamblain, who was not allowed to speak on 
behalf of the FRAPH on 11 June after he said "nobody is safe in 
Haiti" and he reported that he had been attacked, was also 
present at the news conference. Chamblain's presence at the 
FRAPH locale in Delmas, near Port-au-Prince, surprised reporters 
who attended the event because they thought there had been a 
split in the group when Chamblain made those statements after he 
was allegedly attacked. 
  A voodoo ceremony is also being held at the Haitian National 
Pantheon Museum, near the National Palace, this afternoon. 
Chamber of Deputies President Frantz Robert Monde; Emmanuele 
Menard, the director of the museum and of the national 
television station; and Army officers are participating in this 
ceremony. The ceremony, in which flower offerings have been 
made, is organized by a cultural association that was founded by 
Deputy Lionel Bouzi. According to several of the participants, 
the ceremony is being held to honor the country's forefathers.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Gabriela Coutino] </F>
  [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas, 19 Jun -- Peasant and 
Indian members of the State Council of Indian and Peasant 
Organizations [CEOIC] who have been waging a sit-down strike are 
refusing to put their trust in and open negotiations with 
Chiapas Governor Javier Lopez Moreno and other representatives 
of the federal government because, they argue, "we signed a 
draft agreement with them on 4 April and they failed to comply." 
  Meanwhile, Lopez Moreno has explained to the media that he 
is 
not the federal government's commissioner for peace and 
reconciliation in Chiapas: "As governor, it is my duty to 
coordinate compliance with federal and local agreements intended 
to strengthen peace." Lopez Moreno convened a news conference to 
discuss the status of the state. In addition, he maintained 
that conditions exist for holding elections on 21 August. 
  He indicated that within the past 40 hours, significant 
progress has been achieved at the five bargaining tables that 
were set up to establish a more direct dialogue with CEOIC 
members. He did not, however, give any details, and he would 
only say "they were discussing" the agenda outlined by the 
organization. 
  As for the upcoming elections, Lopez Moreno stated: "We are 
moving on satisfactorily, and we maintain good relations with 
all political organizations." Tonight, he indicated he will 
hold a meeting with ranchers and small rural landowners to 
jointly set up a working agenda -- following the same pattern 
used with the CEOIC -- and, in turn, respond to complaints made 
by the ranchers. 
  The peasants, meanwhile, pointed out that the government is 
still lying and that no substantial progress or results have 
come from their negotiations. The Emiliano Zapata Proletariat 
Organization [OPEZ], a member of the CEOIC, noted in a news 
release: "The government is encouraging ranchers and landowners 
by claiming that it will act in keeping with the law (land 
evictions) to recover seized properties." 
  It says that in light of this situation, President Salinas 
should handle the Chiapas problem himself. Having lost hope, 
the peasants view "the system as their historic enemy." The 
news release states that Chiapas is experiencing a class 
conflict in which the government has ceased to be an arbiter and 
has become the ally of the rich. The rich put the government in 
power, and the rich expect to benefit from government policies. 
  This is why Colosio was assassinated, OPEZ adds. Camacho was 
forced to resign because the government still believes Chiapas 
will be a deciding factor in the upcoming elections. 
  But now, OPEZ asserts, current circumstances favor us. A 
unique situation exists, because now there is a Zapatist 
National Liberation Army [EZLN]. "There are no peace 
agreements," elections are coming, and society has great 
expectations. If there are no solutions, we "will radicalize" 
our position by seizing land and carrying out actions to force 
the government to heed us and answer our demands. 
  Another situation affecting the state stems from discontent 
in several local mayor's offices. Following six days in jail, 
four municipal officials from Angel Albino Corzo were freed by 
peasants who demanded an investigation into the case and the 
mayor's dismissal. According to the Chiapas Public Prosecutor's 
Office, the municipal presidency remains closed to prevent any 
aggression. 
<H5>  Proposals From the Chiapas Diocese </H5>
  Tuxtla Gutierrez Bishop Felipe Aguirre Franco said three 
Chiapas dioceses will present several plans and proposals to the 
federal government on the armed conflict. Pope John Paul II 
will give his authorization for this action. 
  Aguirre Franco added that the bishops' proposal has been 
addressed to the Mexican Government through Samuel Ruiz Garcia, 
bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas. At this point, Aguirre 
Franco believes that both the federal and the state governments 
are making "adjustments," but this does not mean that 
negotiations are at a standstill but, rather, that the new EZLN 
proposals are being studied. 
  Aguirre mentioned that on 1-11 July he will be in Rome, 
where 
he will meet with the pope. He will submit an in-depth report 
on the works conducted by his diocese within the past six years 
to the pope. He will also give his view regarding the armed 
Indian uprising in the area of the Chiapas highlands and the 
Lacandona Jungle, and he will give a thorough account of 
developments since the EZLN's emergence.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Betzy Villarreal Rodas] </F>
  [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas, 19 Jun -- Today, Governor 
Javier Lopez Moreno, federal and state coordinator of peace 
efforts in Chiapas, said he is awaiting a reply from the 
Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] to begin exchanging 
work plans and commitments that will lead to the signing of a 
regional peace agreement. 
  Lopez Moreno, however, pointed out that he is not currently 
seeking a dialogue with the EZLN in the buffer zones. He added 
that he will meet today with Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia, when the 
prelate returns from a trip. 
  The state governor delivered a message to the people of 
Mexico and Chiapas: "We are not experiencing the worst of 
conditions, and we are making progress." I trust the EZLN's 
conditions will be appropriate for the holding of elections, and 
even the electoral campaign. 
  He admitted he has good relations with all political 
organizations in the state. He also said he was in a position 
to resolve the agenda proposed by the State Council of the 
Indian and Peasant Organizations as well as to resolve the 
concerns expressed by the small landholders, particularly the 
cattle ranchers. 
  He advised that there are problems in some municipalities in 
the state, such as land seizures, the blocking of highways, and 
unrest in the zones of conflict. Nevertheless, he said, the 
situation is under control.

<F P=106> [By Noel Lorthiois] </F>
  [Text] Mexico City, 20 Jun (AFP) -- Just two months before 
the 21 August Mexican presidential elections, and for the first 
time in 65 years, the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] 
appears seriously threatened, while the popularity of the 
conservative opposition candidate continues to rise. 
  By offering sound alternatives, Catholic attorney Diego 
Fernandez de Ceballos, 53, candidate of the National Action 
Party (PAN, conservative), continues to gain more ground with 
each passing day, according to opinion polls published in the 
Mexican capital in recent weeks. 
  Moreover, according to a government official who asked to 
remain anonymous, as of two weeks ago, unpublished polls showed 
that "one day, the PRI candidate was leading Diego Fernandez 36 
to 34 percent, and the next day, the opposite was true." In 
Mexico, the president is elected by a simple majority and 
universal suffrage in a single-round election. 
  Fernandez's popularity rose markedly after the 12 May 
televised debate between the three main presidential candidates. 
All commentators agreed that the PAN candidate, an excellent 
speaker who is graced with undeniable charisma, was the 
hands-down winner of the debate. This was the first such debate 
organized in Mexico, and it was seen by nearly 50 million 
viewers. 
  Meanwhile, the PRI, which is bogged down in a true crisis 
that reflects the end of its era and shows it is being ripped 
apart by internal quarrels, is losing more sympathizers each and 
every day, and it is obvious that its candidate Ernesto Zedillo, 
43, does not convince the people. 
  Zedillo has the disadvantage of having been hastily 
appointed 
barely three months ago in the wake of the murder of Luis 
Donaldo Colosio, the previous PRI candidate. Zedillo's entire 
career has taken place within ministries (specifically the 
Budget and Education Ministries) and he has never held an 
elected post. He is considered a brilliant technocrat. 
  According to analysts, Zedillo is a victim of the erosion of 
his party, which was created in 1929 by Plutarco Elias Calles. 
The party no longer responds to its initial vocation of being a 
"party of the state" designed to ensure the nation's stability. 
  In fact, within the past six months, the Mexicans have 
watched with consternation a guerrilla rebellion in Chiapas 
State (south), where the conflict still has not been resolved, 
despite the cease-fire; Colosio's murder; a rise in violence and 
kidnappings; and a unsettling increase in drug trafficking. 
Meanwhile, the PRI candidate himself recognizes it is necessary 
to "urgently and deeply" reform justice and the police. 
  After 65 years of PRI rule and in the wake of true 
modernization undertaken by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, 
the Mexicans undoubtedly expect a political change. 
Furthermore, the slogan of "democratic transition" is recalled 
daily as an unavoidable fact, not only by the opposition 
parties, but also by PRI dissidents, the Catholic Church, 
countless intellectuals, and the main political editorial 
writers. 
  The question is who will be able to assure this transition 
and how it will be achieved. As of now, it is believed that the 
PRI probably will not be able to continue ruling alone. 
Nevertheless, it appears unlikely that any elected opposition 
candidate would be able to rule without the PRI, taking into 
account the current alignment of forces. 
  Salinas, who has always maintained that he will turn over 
power to whoever wins the election, will have to face this 
challenge, guarantee transparent elections, and oversee a 
transition without upheavals; otherwise, the nation could sink 
into serious political turmoil.

  [Text] Mexico City, 18 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Mexican Federal 
Electoral Institute (IFE) General Council announced today that 
it will monitor the media to see if reports on the presidential 
candidates' campaigns are fair and objective. During a regular 
session this Saturday, IFE members unanimously agreed to order 
the institution's Radio Broadcasts Commission to file a report 
on their findings by the end of the month at the latest. 
  The Commission is to report to the Council every 15 days 
until the political campaigns conclude on the handling of 
information reported by the media. 
  Over 40 million Mexicans will go to the polls during 21 
August's federal elections to choose a president, 500 deputies, 
128 senators, and 66 Assembly members. The IFE General Council 
plan includes a recommendation to the media, mainly radio and 
television stations, to balance information on the political 
campaigns of the various parties. It also asks the electronic 
media to respect, in their radio and television newscasts, the 
right of Mexicans to be informed about the campaign activities 
of the nine presidential candidates.

  [Text] Progreso, 21 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- It was reported here 
that the Cuban fishermen who arrived in this Mexican eastern 
port, in Yucatan State, asked the government to help them reach 
Florida after they were declared illegal immigrants in Mexico. 
  Bernardo Crespo, navigation chief of the Progreso port, 
pointed out that Cubans Amado Sanchez Garay, 35, and Roberto 
Perez Ruiz, 38, had said they left Cuba 14 days ago to go 
fishing and that a Mexican ship rescued them on 20 June. 
  The official added the Cubans, who were on board a 
high-speed 
boat with registration number 302-322, arrived in the port, 
located 1,800 km east of Mexico City, early this morning and 
they requested help to go to Miami, Florida. The Lamba 302 
fishing boat rescued the two fishermen, whose high-speed boat 
ran out of gas on the high seas. 
  Crespo also said the Cuban fishermen were handed over to 
immigration authorities, who transferred them to Merida, 
Yucatan's capital, located 36 km south of Progreso. 
  Some 193 Cubans have arrived in Yucatan Peninsula coasts so 
far in 1994. In March, seven Cuban boat people were rescued off 
the coast of Isla Contoy, and in April, three groups -- totaling 
183 Cubans -- arrived in this port, Chetumal Bay, near Isla 
Mujeres. 
  Last month, Cuban fisherman Pedro Gutierrez Fernandez 
arrived 
in San Felipe Port, also in Yucatan, after he was rescued by the 
Piscis Mexican fishing boat.

  [Text] In an incident described by the PGR [Attorney 
General's Office] as one of the harshest blows dealt to the drug 
trafficking mafia, on 15 June, authorities arrested Moises 
Juarez Ledezma, alias El Moyo and El Dienton, a key figure in 
the Sonora Cartel headed by Amado Carrillo Fuentes. El Moyo has 
been charged with crimes against public health, which include 
charges of funding, planting, cultivating, storing, and 
transporting drugs. 
  In the areas of Las Minitas and Las Trincheras in Sonora, 
which cover some 5,800 hectares, authorities confirmed the 
discovery of caps and jackets with bogus PGR and PJF [Federal 
Judicial Police] insignias, which were used by cartel members. 
  Meanwhile, the PGR also announced the 12 June arrest of 
Eduardo Salazar Carrillo, assistant PJF inspector in Sinaloa; 
Commander 2d Class Cesar Gomez Castaneda; and policemen Gilberto 
Barrios Barrios and Eric Escamilla Segovia. The four men are 
facing charges in connection with the possession of $306,921 in 
cash, several weapons used exclusively by the Army, and radio 
equipment.

  [Text] The National Defense Secretariat has denied that it 
is contemplating the purchase of three AH-15 [as heard] Super 
Cobra attack helicopters, as was reported Thursday in Washington. 
  In a two-paragraph communique, the Defense Secretariat noted 
that it has not taken any official steps to obtain such military 
equipment. U.S. officials had said that Washington had not 
approved the request for the acquisition of such armaments, 
considering the arrival of the equipment as untimely in view of 
the current situation in Mexico. 
  The Defense Secretariat said the Army and Air Force's 
modernization plans do not contemplate the purchase of this type 
of equipment and that no efforts to this effect have been made 
with the U.S. Government.

  [Text] Pedro Aspe, secretary of finance and public credit 
-- without directly mentioning Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho 
Solis' resignation -- has said that recently we have been 
wrapped up in an unexpected problem that has disheartened many 
Mexicans. 
  Athough domestic as well as foreign events have translated 
into uncertainty in domestic markets, we should be conscious of 
the temporary nature of these events and not lose sight of the 
important economic progress we have achieved, Aspe said. 
  During yesterday's inauguration of Banco Capital -- a new 
institution comprising several banks belonging to the Capital 
Financial Group -- Pedro Aspe said the banking sector is moving 
toward universal banking. This not only means that a wide range 
of financial services will now be offered through bank windows, 
but it also implies the creation of special market niches and 
increased competitive advantages in a dynamic market. According 
to information delivered by Aspe, the new bank will initiate 
operations with paid capital of 120 million pesos, and its aim 
will be to offer services to small and medium-sized industries, 
particularly in Mexico City. Banco Capital now joins the 
invoicing, renting, and guarantee companies previously held by 
Capital Group. 
  According to Jaime Weiss, chairman of this financial group's 
Board of Directors, capital has grown from 3 million new pesos 
at the beginning of 1990 to 420 million new pesos at the end of 
last month. The executive said that another division -- 
institutional investments -- has been added to the existing one 
-- which in the coming months will feature 280 million new pesos 
to achieve total capital of 700 million new pesos. 
  Jaime Weiss also indicated that in 1993, Capital Financial 
Group placed 723 million new pesos in new credit among 3,563 
customers, and, should this trend continue, it has scheduled the 
placing of more than 1 billion new pesos among 1,200 new 
customers. 
  The new institution will have a nationwide presence and is 
scheduled to open four branches this year. The services offered 
will include investment services, consumer credit, contract 
loans, bridge loans, and nonrevolving mortgages, along with 
trustee services, foreign exchange and credit services via 
automatic tellers, as well as others.

<F P=106> [Report by Javier Rodriguez] </F>
  [Text] The Institute for Studies on the Democratic 
Revolution [IERD] of the PRD [Party of the Democratic 
Revolution] has opened a forum to analyze the party's economic 
proposals. At the opening session, Porfirio Munoz Ledo 
criticized the economic program of Ernesto Zedillo and the 
proposals of the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] leader 
to "eradicate poverty" in the country. 
  IERD Director Efigenia Martinez also harshly criticized 
Zedillo's proposals and described as demagogic the plan to 
eradicate poverty with "programs against poverty" when 
investment, employment, good salaries, and a fair social policy 
offering equal opportunities are those things that are needed to 
achieve this goal. 
  Munoz Ledo accused Zedillo of drafting one of the most 
deceitful government programs ever seen in Mexico. This 
program, he added, was drafted at a time when the current PRI 
presidential candidate headed the now-defunct Secretariat of 
Programming and Budget. 
  The PRD national leader noted that in Zedillo's growth 
program for the country, Zedillo "did not offer a 6-percent GNP 
growth rate for this year, a splendid macroeconomy, higher 
employment, and, of course, a system to finance development that 
does not exist in our country." [sentence as published] 
  The PRD economic proposal, the party leader said, wants to 
become a historic program because it is designed to transform a 
political and economic system that will only have true meaning 
if the country's political system is changed through a new 
alignment of forces. 
  There is no economic model in history that is not based on a 
new alignment of political forces because "a true political 
program calls for change and a renewal of a thesis and a plan 
based on emerging political forces." 
  Munoz Ledo added that the PRD program calls for the 
abolition 
of the authoritarian system, a return of power to the citizens, 
the implementation of a true federalist system, a division of 
power, and control by the people's representatives of the 
leaders and of public spending. 
  It also calls for the establishment of municipal autonomy; 
dissolution of the corporate system; freedom for economic 
players; and the elimination of pacts, authoritarianism, 
centralism, and the system based on large estates 
[patrimonialismo]. "This is a political program to eliminate 
the state party system," he added. 
  The forum is intended to fine-tune and enrich the party's 
economic proposal. There will be two sessions. One took place 
yesterday and the other will be held on 20 June. About 20 PRD 
economists and others who have ties to the party will 
participate. 
  Among the issues mentioned in the economic proposal are 
industrial development, foreign trade, social policies to create 
jobs and raise salaries, and a broad industrialization strategy 
that calls for restructuring fiscal policy to encourage 
investments and reduce inflation through increased production of 
goods and services to achieve a more equitable distribution of 
wealth. 
  A primary element of this strategy is the promotion of a 
clear-cut renegotiation of the foreign debt with the 
international financial community and the struggle against the 
country's foreign debt. 
  Another major element is the renegotiation of all clauses in 
the NAFTA accord that affect national development, while 
immediately exempting basic grains from this agreement and 
maintaining the state's autonomous power to establish tariffs, 
issue import permits, subsidies, and development policies to 
achieve self-sufficiency in food. The pact also needs to be 
renegotiated to neutralize the control the United States has 
over Mexican agricultural markets. 
  The program also calls for an adjustment of subsidies on 
exports for national agricultural producers to match those in 
the United States, as well as the including in NAFTA the issue 
of labor mobility to balance out differences in labor conditions 
and thereby stop the export of underpriced labor from Mexico. 
  It does not abandon the original PRD proposal to promote a 
Continental Agreement for Development, Employment, and Trade 
that recognizes differences between the countries in Latin 
America and the Caribbean and those in North America. 
  The program stresses the need to hold national discussions 
on 
important international agreements through referendums prior to 
their approval or rejection by Congress. 
  The PRD program seeks to hike minimum wages to guarantee 
goods, health, and housing to workers, and with this in mind, it 
proposes the elimination of the National Commission on Minimum 
Wages to allow the Congress of the Union to determine, in 
agreement with unions and employers, bases for and means of 
establishing minimum wages. This implies "eliminating arbitrary 
government meddling in salaries established by contract." 
  It proposes a review of the effects of the tax structure on 
small businesses, medium-size companies, and on middle and 
low-income classes, as well as a review of the distribution of 
fiscal obligations among federal, state, and municipal 
authorities in an effort to devise a fair tax system. 
  The PRD proposal also calls for the elimination of the 
2-percent tax on company assets. It calls for a tax policy 
based on the principles of equity and the promotion of 
productive activities. In this regard, it calls for the 
presentation of a multiannual budget of public revenues and 
expenditures and the elimination of the uncertainty created by 
the so-called miscellaneous tax matter category. 
  It also proposes the gradual reduction of taxes levied on 
the 
large profits of Mexican Petroleum and the rechannelling of such 
funds mainly into the development of the national petrochemical 
industry.

    [Editorial report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Mexican economic developments monitored through 21 
June. 
  The Finance and Public Credit Secretariat has authorized the 
Mexican Association of Banks to extend a line of credit of up to 
2 billion pesos to conclude a restructuring program of expired 
loans. Most of these loans are for the agriculture sector. 
(Monterrey EL NORTE (Foreign Edition) in Spanish 16 June 94 p 
21A) 
  The agriculture and hydraulic resources (SARH) secretary has 
said the marketing system is the Achilles heel preventing 
Mexican producers access to international markets. The 
secretary has offered SARH support to Yucatan Peninsula 
producers of rice, chile peppers, sugarcane, and citrus fruits 
to cover not only local demands but also export goals. (Mexico 
City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 17 June 94 pp 1, 5) 
  The Mexican Bank of Foreign Trade has granted $222.1 million 
to the southeastern part of the country from January to May, 40 
percent more than during the same period in 1993, Alberto Rio, 
promotion manager for that area, has reported. The sectors that 
benefited in the five states -- Yucatan, Quintana Roo, Chiapas, 
Tabasco, and Campeche -- were primarily agriculture, tourism, 
fishing, and manufacturing. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 
1957 GMT 18 June 94) 
  Approximately 50,000 producers owe $16 billion to the 
Mexican 
banking system, and given the impossibility of recovering the 
investment, the Mexican Banking Association has offered a 
renegotiation aimed at financing the development of the nation. 
The problems started in July 1993 due to the economic recession 
and uncontrolled growth in loans granted without guarantees that 
were aimed at reactivating economic growth in the past five 
years. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 1408 GMT 18 June 94) 
  According to the National Banking Commission, Mexican 
banking 
systems revenues dropped 14.1 percent during the first quarter 
compared to the same period in 1993, the result of a reduced 
volume of business, bad loans, a fall in the exchange rate, and 
an increase in interest rates. Nevertheless, it was stated that 
for the remainder of the year, this trend could be reversed due 
to the government's monetary policy. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 
1426 GMT 18 June 94) 
  Yesterday, peasant organizations stated the failure of the 
agricultural policy during the current six-year period has 
resulted in a 19-percent decrease in basic grain production, the 
unemployment of 2 million peasants, and an annual loss of 13 
billion pesos by producers. The organizations stated the 
compensatory measures the executive has announced will not make 
up for losses in past years registering in the millions

15A)

  [Text] The National Council on Belize, which will be in 
charge of conducting a general and thorough evaluation of the 
dispute over that territory, was officially installed today. 
  An agreement to update and reorganize the National Council 
on 
Belize specifies that the entity will do studies and planning 
and will advise the Foreign Ministry on all matters related to 
the territorial dispute with Belize. 
  The Council will be headed by Foreign Minister Gladys 
Maritza 
Ruiz de Vielman and will be made up of the following persons, 
who will work without compensation: Fernando Andrade Diaz 
Duran, Roberto Bermejo Gonzalez, Eduardo Castillo Arriola, Erwin 
Fernando Guzman Ovalle, (Alberto Errarte Gonzalez), Roberto 
Herrera Ibarguen, Carlos Larios Ochaita, Jorge Lujan Munoz, 
Oscar Clemente Marroquin Godoy, Gabriel Orellana Rojas, Mario 
Quinonez Amezquita, Jorge Skinner Klee, and Francisco Villagran 
Kramer. 
  The 8 June agreement states that the territorial dispute 
with 
Belize and the search for a solution within the framework of the 
Constitution and the principles of international law are matters 
of national interest. The document recognizes the 
appropriateness of the Foreign Ministry receiving the advice of 
qualified citizens who, based on their knowledge and 
capabilities, can help formulate an adequate policy to resolve 
the territorial dispute with Belize.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 21 Jun (AFP) -- Honduran Foreign 
Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar today described as "unfair, 
lamentable, and deplorable" the $20 fee for each visa 
application charged by the U.S. Consulate in Tegucigalpa. 
  "It is unfair so much money is charged for a simple, 
administrative form," the Honduran minister said, reacting to a 
decision the U.S. Government announced on 20 June. This 
decision will be applied in all Central American countries. 
  Fernando Sanchez, the U.S. consul in Tegucigalpa, has said 
the charge is to prevent people who do not even have $20 from 
approaching the U.S. Consulate to request a visa, because their 
intention is none other than to migrate to the United States. 
  "I believe this is an unfair decision. I have said the only 
way to prevent large flows of Caribbean and Central American 
immigrants to the United States and the developed countries is 
by consolidating freer, stronger, and more competitive economies 
in our countries," Paz Aguilar said. 
  According to Sanchez' estimates, approximately 50,000 
Hondurans go to the consulate every year to request visas, of 
which approximately 30,000 are granted, meaning the consulate 
would be receiving $1 million if the current flow of 
applications continues.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Honduran economic developments monitored through 21 
June. 
  The Honduran private banking sector has disclosed that 
non-traditional Honduran exports increased by 22 percent in 
1993. According to the Tegucigalpa-based Banco Atlantida, income 
from non-traditional sales on the international market amounted 
to $226 million. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1957 GMT 13 Jun 94) 
  The Central Bank Board of Directors has decided to increase 
its cash reserve by six points. This will begin on 16 June and 
is to be done gradually, increasing one point every 15 days 
until it reaches 40 percent on 30 September. This is a measure 
to prevent the sliding of the lempira with regard to the dollar 
and to put a stop to the spiraling inflation. (San Pedro Sula 
TIEMPO in Spanish 15 Jun 94 p 3) 
  A banking source told ACAN-EFE that the fever to save 
dollars 
in Honduras has reduced deposits in the local currency by 1.3 
percent. According to this source, the country's monetary system 
is experiencing a "strong expansion of deposits in dollars," and 
has surpassed expectations in less than a year. (Panama City 
ACAN in Spanish 1442 GMT 18 Jun 94)

<F P=106> [Report by Aida Castillo] </F>
  [Text] At a news conference following the signing of an 
agreement between Nicaragua and the EU, Manuel Marin, EU vice 
president for Latin America, Asia, and the Mediterranean Region, 
said the EU does not agree with the United States on the move to 
remove the financial aid offered to the Nicaraguan Government 
should the property issue remain unsettled. 
  The agreement, called "The Consolidation of the State of Law 
and the Promotion of the Economic Takeoff in Rural Nicaragua," 
offers $20 million to small- and medium-scale producers in the 
Nicaraguan northern and Pacific zones. This donation will be 
disbursed within five years. 
  The agreement's main objective is to authorize the use of 
and 
issue property titles to more than 220,000 manzanas belonging to 
small- and medium-scale producers. This plan approves the use 
of 70 percent of the country's land. 
  In addition, the agreement will sponsor the creation of a 
savings and loans network (30 branches) as a 
financial source for peasants, who will also be legally and 
physically trained to keep their properties. 
  Marin ratified the support for the Nicaraguan Government 
with 
the signing of this development project and pointed out that 
within the peace process this project will "be used to attract 
investors to Nicaragua, which needs them greatly." He added 
that, along with other donor countries, the EU is supporting the 
Nicaraguan effort to have the Paris Club forgive its foreign 
debt. However, he maintained that receiving "this much economic 
aid" is unhealthy, adding "Nicaragua should be attempting to 
receive less." 
<H5>  Blandon Talks About Paris </H5>
  Since 1990, the EU has given a third of the economic aid 
this 
organization allocates for Latin America -- more than $80 
million -- to Nicaragua. 
  The EU official met yesterday morning with President Violeta 
Chamorro, who was accompanied by Deputy Foreign Cooperation 
Minister Sergio Mario Blandon. He stressed the results of the 
Paris meeting held by the World Bank Advisory Group, in which 
Nicaragua was offered $750 million in economic aid for this 
year. Blandon pointed out the amount of money deemed necessary 
to "close up and implement" the Enhanced Structural Adjustment 
Policy Program signed with the IMF was obtained at the Paris 
meeting. 
  Questioned on how the disbursements will be made, the deputy 
minister explained the Nicaraguan Government will try to have 
the funds "disbursed as soon as possible." He also said 
"payments are made according to schedules, because not only 
countries but also international financial institutions are 
involved." Blandon stressed that $60 million in economic aid 
for this year are included in the $750-million package. "This 
means these additional funds will be available to be invested in 
production." The government had previously said that additional 
funds for 1994 would amount to $75 million.

  [Text] Panama City, 21 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Panama has informed 
the United States that it is impossible for Panama to receive 
Haitian refugees because of the serious economic crisis the 
nation is experiencing, the Foreign Ministry reported here today. 
  Acting Foreign Minister Carlos Cordero said: "We have 
cooperated and will continue offering aid to the Haitians, but 
at this time it is impossible to receive them." After noting 
Panama's current high unemployment rate (15 percent), Cordero 
said a mass influx of Caribbean refugees would only worsen the 
Panamanian people's economic and social situation. 
  Last week the Panamanian Government denied press reports 
announcing the arrival of refugees in Panama. Recently, 
President William Clinton suggested to the nations of the region 
that they receive Haitian citizens who are fleeing the island 
because of the serious political crisis that threatens to end in 
a U.S. military invasion.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 21 Jun (NA) -- Foreign Minister Guido 
Di Tella today emphasized "the importance" of the meeting 
Presidents Carlos Menem and Bill Clinton will hold on 24 June 
because "it is a good signal for investors." 
  Di Tella justified the presence of entrepreneurs Armando 
Gostanian and Mario Falak, barber Tony Cuozzo, and golf coach 
Fidel de Luca in the presidential entourage, which is in Canada, 
on the grounds that they "are close to the president and he 
wants them to come. Period." 
  In statements to Radio Continental, Di Tella this morning 
explained that "empty seats on the presidential plane do not 
mean savings," in an attempt to justify the presence of those 
people in the official entourage. 
  The minister added: "It is good for Argentine taxpayers to 
pay for a trip for Menem to meet Clinton because of the 
meeting's significance. This meeting will add new political 
significance to our relations with the United States." 
  Concerning Menem's visit to Canada, Di Tella emphasized that 
the nuclear cooperation agreement is the most important accord 
to be signed. He explained that this cooperation "is possible 
because Argentina has become a nonproliferation country," adding 
that "in the past, with our proliferation policy, we had no 
chance to have access to technology or cooperation." 
  Di Tella thus alluded to a government decision to deactivate 
the Condor-II missile project and other suspicious nuclear 
developments. 
  "In his meetings with Canadian officials, Menem always 
refers 
to the current Argentine situation and the economic changes. He 
thus paves the way for entrepreneurs, who are the ones who then 
engage in partnerships, credits, or joint projects," he said. 
  Di Tella said he doubted that President Menem will attend 
the 
game the Argentine and Nigerian soccer teams will play in the 
world tournament on 25 June because of the changes in the agenda 
after confirmation of the meeting with U.S. President Clinton.

  [Text] According to a DYN news agency dispatch, the 
Argentine and UK Governments will begin negotiations on possible 
"offshore" oil exploitation around the Malvinas Islands. A 
special commission has been charged with conducting the talks, 
which will start on 1 July. Deputy Foreign Minister Fernando 
Petrella will head the Argentine mission. 
  In an interview with DYN, Foreign Ministry Secretary General 
Andres Cisneros asserted that "we have agreed to sit down at the 
negotiating table, to see how we can avoid having future oil 
exploitation affect the interests of the parties involved." He 
thus alluded to the Argentine-UK controversy over the 
sovereignty of the Malvinas Islands. 
  Cisneros pointed out that in the course of the talks 
"Argentina will use all the legal and political resources it has 
at its disposal to claim its rights before the governments and 
companies interested in tapping oil in the area." 
  Around the end of the year, or at the beginning of 1995, the 
British Government allegedly intends to license several offshore 
ventures for hydrocarbons prospecting in the area near the 
Malvinas Islands. This move is reportedly based on prior 
studies claiming that the area could be rich in oil and gas. 
  A report drafted and published by the British Geological 
Survey -- consultants for the Malvinas' British authorities -- 
argues that recent seismic studies over an area extending 200 
square km around the Malvinas Islands revealed the existence of 
sedimentary basins comparable to the North Sea oil fields (which 
belong to the United Kingdom). 
  The Argentine Government questions the real perspectives for 
a feasible exploitation of these resources from an economic 
standpoint. It has even expressed certain reservations about 
the interest international companies allegedly have in 
participating in oil prospecting in the area. 
  The executive branch is nevertheless getting ready to tackle 
a round of negotiations with the British Government to be held 
in London and in Buenos Aires, as was decided last year by the 
High Level Group in charge of conducting bilateral economic and 
political negotiations under the so-called diplomatic umbrella 
agreed upon by both parties in 1990, which leaves out the 
question of sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands. 
  Cisneros conceded that "Great Britain continues to show 
hostility toward Argentina in international forums. The 
islanders refuse to establish any kind of trade with the only 
neighbor they have in the world, and react to it as if it were 
an uncouth and hostile country even though 12 years have already 
elapsed since the war." 
  Cisneros concluded by ruling out the possibility that the 
United Kingdom might decide to go ahead in the development of an 
oil prospecting scheme in the Malvinas islands without having 
reached prior agreement with Argentina.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 17 Jun (NA) -- The chairmen of Radical 
Civic Union [UCR] party districts stated on 17 June that their 
party "is poised to once again become a government alternative 
and a real and credible option." They labeled the current 
administration "incapable" of solving the problems confronting 
the country. 
  Party leaders on 16 June held a plenary session convened by 
the Political Action Committee presided over by Cordoba Governor 
Eduardo Cesar Angeloz. They issued a document on 17 June in 
which they stated that "the UCR faces two challenges -- to 
reorganize the party and achieve its unity, and to become an 
alternative within the opposition. [no closing quotation marks 
as received] 
  They stressed that the establishment of the Political Action 
Committee "is a signal to society and to the party itself that 
the UCR is capable of overcoming differences." 
  The document went on to say that "we are seeking to 
reestablish unity within the party, a party in which different 
styles and leanings may coexist with one another, but which 
presents a united front when it has to define a course of 
action, measures, and a national model." 
  Each of the 24 party district chairmen took the floor at the 
plenary session to present an analysis of each province's 
economic, political, and social situation. Commenting on these 
presentations, Angeloz said that some of them "painted pictures 
that made one's hair stand on end." 
  Having analyzed the social, economic, and political 
situation 
of each province, as well as the party situation in each 
district, the document underscored that the UCR "is poised to 
once again become a government alternative." 
  It contended that "the government, which offers stability, 
is 
incapable of offering Argentines a formula to meet the country's 
main necessities: genuine growth and active social policies." 
  In conclusion, the document stated that "the UCR is again in 
a position to represent the dynamic forces of society, and is 
ready to transform and modernize Argentina."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 19 Jun (NA) -- Peruvian citizen Jorge 
Diaz Reategui, who was detained a week ago in the city of 
Tucuman on charges of being a member of the Shining Path [SL] 
guerrilla group, was released after it was confirmed that he is 
no longer a SL member. 
  Diaz Reategui was released on 17 June after an Interpol 
report confirmed that Diaz Reategui is a SL deserter who 
received special OAS political asylum. 
  The Peruvian police have confirmed that no arrest warrant 
has 
been issued on Diaz Reategui. It was also confirmed that his 
Argentine residence permit is authentic. 
  Diaz Reategui was detained at a hotel in the poor district 
of 
"El Bajo," near the bus terminal of the city of San Miguel de 
Tucuman. At the time of Diaz Reategui's detention, it was 
reported that he was participating in a meeting with other 
alleged guerrillas who escaped. 
  Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf accused Diaz Reategui of 
participating in protests in some northern provinces. Ruckauf 
noted that those who were meeting with Diaz Reategui "had been 
spotted in other parts of our country, participating in public 
disorders."

  [Text] Santa Cruz, 11 Jun (PRESENCIA) -- Acting President 
Victor Hugo Cardenas said today that the country does not need 
any kind of political deal or secret "agreement," as he would be 
the first to report such cases. 
  Cardenas made this comment in reference to reports about a 
tacit agreement between the MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary 
Left] and the MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement] by which 
no charges would be filed against national MIR leaders for their 
links with drug trafficking, in exchange for a harsh sentence 
for Justices Edgar Oblitas Fernandez and Ernesto Poppe Zubieta. 
  Cardenas rejected the validity of that report, saying that 
there are no real elements to sustain the media reports of a 
"dubious political scheme" between the MNR and the MIR regarding 
the two issues. Cardenas asserted that the government wants to 
do justice and not break it. 
  He said, however, that if a situation such as that reported 
by the media emerges, "I would be the first to report it and 
condemn it, as this type of agreement or deal can only hurt the 
country and the democratic process that was so hard for the 
country to recover." 
  President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada himself categorically 
denied the media report before leaving for Colombia and the 
United States, saying that "our struggle is against corruption. 
We don't negotiate these cases, and although we don't want to 
hurt anyone, our will is to enforce the law."

  [Excerpt] Tarija, 10 Jun -- Just as everything seemed to 
indicate that Edgar Martinez, the candidate of the Trade Union 
Federation of Bolivian Mine Workers, would be the next COB 
[Bolivian Labor Federation] executive secretary, there has been 
a turnabout: At the very last minute the miners withdrew their 
candidate because they realized that he would not get enough 
votes. Thus Oscar Salas was reelected by landslide. 
  The alliance between the ruling party and the ASD 
[Democratic 
Socialist Alternative] was sealed at the lengthy plenary meeting 
of the 10th COB Congress, which started at 1600 on 9 June and 
ended at 0815 the next day. The workers call this alliance 
"unsavory." 
  Before the voting started, Fred Nunez, one of the workers' 
leaders, claimed "the ruling party had prepared" a list of 
candidates that they circulated among workers. This "ticket" 
comprises ASD, MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement], and UCS 
[Solidarity Civic Union] members. The reading of this ticket 
did not elicit any comments, and the congress elected the new 
COB executive board. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Highlights" of interview with Oscar Salas Moya, the </F>
reelected Bolivian Labor Federation, COB, secretary general, by 
Edwin Miranda; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Miranda] Please give us your general opinion on the 
results of the 10th COB Congress. 
  [Salas] Right from the start, the COB assembly decided to 
reorganize the Bolivian labor union movement. Reports by the 
seven COB working committees all reflect the workers' demands on 
the need to defend their and the country's interests. 
  We attained our first objective: the first proposal 
regarding 
changes and amendments to achieve a modern labor organization in 
keeping with the current political situation in the country and 
world was approved in a political document of the 10th COB 
Congress. 
  The assembly has ended, and the results of the COB Congress 
are quite clear and objective. The COB ratified its strong 
opposition to neo-liberalism, to the government's socio-economic 
policy, and ratified the prospect of changes within the COB to 
safeguard its institutional existence. 
  The Congress fulfilled the objectives established at the 
start as a result of the vision and responsibility entrusted to 
it by its grassroots. 
  [Miranda] What does the approved political document state? 
  [Salas] This document will guide the COB's organic life for 
the next few years. Aside from the documents that were approved 
-- the congress discussed three documents -- I want to point out 
something very important that the workers must follow: To uphold 
the proposals referring to the struggle and life of the Bolivian 
workers. 
  More often than not these documents do not tacitly express 
the legitimate rights of the working class of a nation. In my 
opinion the most important thing is to organize, guide, and meet 
the workers' most urgent needs. 
  Political parties should not impose their policies on the 
workers. The charges made against me in this regard are false 
and by no means reflect the truth. 
  Obviously I am a member of the ASD [Democratic Socialist 
Alternative], but this in no way means I will blindly follow the 
ideology of my party. There is enough will and autonomy to 
adopt decisions and I will see to it that these principles are 
respected. 
  [Miranda] What political tendency will the COB follow? 
  [Salas] One thing is clear: Oligarchy and U.S. imperialism 
is 
spreading in Bolivia, seeking to impose a long-term hegemony 
that will affect the Bolivian economy, society, and politics. 
  We are fully aware that this foreign intervention policy 
causes suffering to the people and affects the country's 
interests. 
  The policy that will guide the COB's organic life will be to 
implement a labor policy that will prevent that hegemony. 
  We will wage a total struggle against imperialism and to 
adopt a staunch civil resistance to neo-liberalism in Bolivia. 
  [Miranda] What are the positive results of the COB Congress? 
  [Salas] A political debate within the Bolivian labor sector 
is necessary, absolutely necessary. It improves the 
organization's life and guides fellow workers. I maintain, 
however, that the legitimate interests of the workers are 
paramount. 
  I am absolutely convinced that any political stance within 
the COB is important and deserves to be respected within the 
democratic framework that has characterized the activities of 
the workers in the labor union. 
  Ideological confrontations are normal. However, I insist 
that the workers' plans come above everything else. 
  I urge miners, peasants, railway workers, labor unions, and 
all other COB members to place the unity of the working class 
above any ideological disagreement. 
  They must place the unity of peasants, of those who do not 
earn a salary, above everything because only thus will the COB 
be strong enough to defend the interests of the working class.

<F P=106> [Article by Patricia Almaraz] </F>
  [Text] As of today the Bolivian Labor Federation (COB) will 
begin a new period that will not merely be a continuation of the 
present. According to what was observed, the big difference is 
that the COB no longer has the support of the miners, its 
political guidelines are linked to those of the current 
government and are without structural changes. 
  After 10 days of meetings, the 10th COB Congress concluded 
early on the morning of 10 June in the city of Tarija. The 
expectations of its members and of the government itself were 
focused on that congress, awaiting the consolidation or 
rejection of the theories of change and organizational and 
internal adjustments to the COB. 
  But the reorganization did not take place, and the congress 
ratified the COB as a "classist and labor" union organization 
that recognizes the importance of those who do not earn a wage, 
receives them as important allies, admits their numerical 
importance, while the political and ideological lines are 
established by the proletariat. 
  Unlike in previous years, the COB will be led by a union 
leader and guided by a political document which follows that 
ideological trend: Oscar Salas of the Democratic Socialist 
Alternative (ASD). 
  For the first time in its history, the COB will not have the 
support of one of the most important sectors: the miners. The 
COB executive secretary, who was reelected, said this will 
surely weaken the organization a bit. 
  Opposed to this idea, the most radical within the union 
claim 
the result of the congress could increase a polarization of 
positions at the grassroots in the absence of a board that 
represents the demands of all members. 
  In an unusual form of election, Salas and the executive 
committee that will accompany him during the next two years were 
elected by designation of each of the sectors and not by the 
congress, which is the top union authority. 
  The designation of Executive Secretary Oscar Salas and of 
Finance Secretary Carlos Camargo was established after they left 
the congress; the installation of the new union board was held 
in absence of the top leader and half of the congress 
participants. 
  The organization of the executive committee which will be 
led 
by Oscar Salas does -- as he himself admitted -- strongly favor 
parties of the government coalition, 50 percent in total. Among 
them are leaders of the MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary 
Movement], of the MBL [Free Bolivia Movement], and of the UCS 
[Solidarity Civic Union], while the rest comprises the ASD, Eje 
Pachacuti [Pachacuti Axis Movement], Comunero, Condepa 
[Conscience of the Fatherland], MIR [Movement of the 
Revolutionary Left], FRI [Revolutionary Front of the Left], POR 
[Revolutionary Workers Party], and the PIE [expansion unknown] 
of the Filemon Escobar trend. 
  Salas said this has little importance because during the 
previous administration the COB was fully controlled by the 
Patriotic Accord.

  [Text] La Paz, 12 Jun (ANF) -- Minister of Government 
German Quiroga has stated that the administration has $21 
million to replace with other crops the coca plantations on 
35,200 hectares in the subtropical region of Cochabamba 
Department. 
  He explained that this investment is included in this year's 
budget, and will be implemented provided the peasant leaders 
allow it and do not oppose the voluntary eradication of coca. 
  Quiroga admitted that peasant union leaders are one of the 
main obstacles for the Alternative Development Program, as they 
are urging union members to oppose voluntary eradication in 
order to obtain more benefits. 
  Government sources have explained that through alternative 
development the Chapare -- Bolivia's top coca-producing region, 
and the world's second largest -- will benefit from agricultural 
development that will eventually replace the drug-driven 
underground economy. 
  According to the sources, the products that will replace 
coca 
will be: bananas, pineapple, heart of palm, fodder, crafts, and 
other profitable items. 
  According to information obtained from the "First Itinerant 
Show: Bolivia Free from Drugs," at the end of November 1993 the 
country had 47,200 hectares of coca plantations, that is, 35,200 
hectares in excess of the 11,725 hectares needed to supply 
traditional uses. 
  At that time the nation's overall production of coca leaves 
from these 47,200 hectares was 82,800 tons, of which 71,075 tons 
went to drug traffickers. 
  These figures will decline once the voluntary eradication 
program is under way. The U.S. Government has offered to 
contribute $20 million to the program if Bolivia complies with 
the eradication target of 5,000 hectares.

  [Text] Government Minister German Quiroga has said that the 
leaders among the coca growers are unwilling to eradicate their 
surplus coca plantations, and that they are not fulfilling their 
commitment with the executive power. 
  While the government is willing to invest about $21 million 
in alternative development as the coca surplus is being 
eradicated, Quiroga revealed that the coca leaders are visiting 
the settlements of Carrasco Province in the Cochabamba 
Department to convince the growers not to eradicate coca. 
  Quiroga announced that to correct this situation the 
government will do "something" to lower the price of coca. 
  He said: "If we don't get the price of coca produced for 
drug trafficking to drop, the policy of voluntary eradication 
will fail." 
  According to the minister, the only reason coca is well paid 
by drug traffickers is because there is no adequate control 
system for marketing coca. 
  This has been proven by the government, which is sure that 
when the main coca market in Sacaba operates without control the 
price of coca increases some 20 to 25 percent. 
  "As soon as the Sacaba market is put under control, the 
price 
tends to drop," said Quiroga, who indicated that coca prices 
will drop if the five coca markets are kept under control.

<F P=106> [Article by Delfin Arias Vargas] </F>
  [Text] According to several government officials, 
alternative development, understood as a process of 
socioeconomic transformations, is the main instrument intended 
to reverse the economy that depends on coca in the Chapare 
region. 
  According to official data provided by the Government 
Ministry and other state and private institutions that work in 
programs seeking to replace coca crops with other products, 
those remarks are based on the gradual increase in 
agroindustrial activities in that controversial area. 
  Although this solution is apparently feasible, there are 
several objections such as the inconceivable influence of drug 
traffickers to maintain justifiable prices for the surplus coca 
leaves, the precarious economic situation of most peasants in 
the Chapare region, and the lack of assured markets for the 
products they intend to replace, without mentioning the 
industrialization of coca for a reduced national market that 
makes the project already approved by the executive branch 
unfeasible. 
  Notwithstanding this situation, government officials claim 
that the change is possible. They argue that in the past few 
years the investment of more than $200 million in the region has 
helped conduct a gradual transformation that will help improve 
the production capacity and the growth of alternative crops. 
  Gaston Martinic, chairman of the National Fund for 
Alternative Development (Fonadal), stated: "If we manage to 
make the peasants understand this, namely the peasant producers 
of coca, we will be paving the way toward the fulfillment of the 
anti-drug fight's objectives, in addition to achieving a process 
for development and voluntary replacement of coca crops." 
  In a seminar sponsored by the La Paz Reporters Association, 
Martinic explained that preliminary studies have determined that 
the share of the coca-cocaine economy in the country's GDP in 
1987 was 26 percent. He added that coca production yielded $238 
million, mainly benefiting drug traffickers. 
  Since then, drug enforcement action has allowed substantial 
achievements, including the eradication of almost 25,000 
hectares of coca crops considered illegal by Law No. 1008. 
However, the action has caused the loss in value added tax 
revenue of $472.3 million for the country, which uncovered the 
national economy's dependency on the coca-cocaine circuit, 
Martinic added. 
  Official reports on projects carried out through March in 
Chapare allow us to cite the following results that, considering 
the 250,000 inhabitants living in that region, cannot be called 
successful, according to peasant leaders, who even question the 
figures' accuracy. 
  With the support of U.S. AID and the UNDCP [expansion 
unknown] of the United Nations, 818 km of roads were restored, 
618 km were made usable, and 19 bridges were built in the region. 
  They said that in the past few years U.S. AID has subsidized 
the construction of 38 schools, the provision of drinkable water 
to 59 towns, the revamping of 15 community centers, and a vast 
social assistance program. 
  Concerning electric services, 394 km of primary lines, 110 
km 
of secondary lines, and 24 transformers were installed, and 
1,165 street lights also were installed. 
  The same reports add that the increase in alternative crops, 
which despite the gradual increase, only matches the surplus 
coca crops estimated at 35,500 hectares. 
  Bananas: A total of 7,075 hectares were planted in 1986, but 
in 1993 banana plantations reached 10,875 hectares. Pineapple: 
In 1986 a total of 395 hectares of pineapple were harvested, 
but 2,618 hectares were planted in 1993. Black pepper: The 
first crops reached 32 hectares in 1993. Passion fruit: A total 
of 63 hectares of this fruit were planted in 1993. Subsistence 
crops: In 1986 a total of 8,000 hectares were planted, while in 
1993 planting reached 11,558 hectares. Heart of palms: A total 
of 241 hectares were planted in 1993 alone.

    [Editorial Report] La Paz HOY in Spanish on 12 June carries 
on page 18 a 1,500-word report datelined Santa Cruz by Jose 
Manuel Pando, who notes that "the assets seized from drug 
traffickers, instead of being used for social projects, go into 
the pockets of a few and disappear into thin air." 
  The report states that "five years after Law 1008" (the 
Repentance Law) "was implemented, the state and society have 
hardly benefited from the confiscated goods of millionaires, 
which because of inadequate government policy get lost 
irretrievably." 
  Pando comments that "Law No. 1008 authorizes drug 
enforcement 
authorities to confiscate assets and investigate the origins of 
dubious fortunes, and in a few years has allowed the 
confiscation of mansions, farms, vehicles, aircraft, property, 
jewelry, and money worth more than $50 million, but 
unfortunately most of these goods have been stolen or misused." 
  The report then notes that Santa Cruz District Attorney 
Francisco Borestein commented not long ago that the assets 
seized from drug traffickers were misused, and that there were 
questions as to how the large sums of money seized from drug 
traffickers have been used. He also said that many assets had 
disappeared, such as was the case with several vehicles, because 
of poor administration. 
  The report then mentions Government Minister German Quiroga 
as having noted that the money seized from drug traffickers is 
placed into the hands of judicial authorities, while not long 
ago Attorney Ives Padilla said that the Office of the Attorney 
General is not in charge of administering and guarding 
confiscated assets because the Office of Confiscated Assets does 
that. 
  After describing several cases in which public servants 
misused the assets confiscated from drug traffickers, the report 
mentions that according to recent information there are 214 
confiscated vehicles and some 100 houses in Santa Cruz alone 
that run the risk of deteriorating or being looted by public 
servants.
