  [Text] Rene Diaz Olivera, vice minister of domestic trade, 
stated that effective 1 July, stores that sell articles for 
travel abroad will close down. 
  Diaz explained that this measure was taken in light of the 
current shortage of supplies, which became more acute at the end 
of last year and continues this year. For this reason, stores 
such as El Baluarte, La Internacional, and Lujos, which sell 
shoes, clothing, and other goods for travelers, will close down 
on 1 July. Diaz added that organizations and enterprises with 
an established clientele will receive a letter giving more 
details.

  [Text] Several Western Army units are conducting the second 
exercise of the first half of 1994. The exercise is called: 
Moncada II 94-1. 
  Division General Leopoldo Cintras Frias, chief of the 
Western 
Army, and other high-level officials, witnessed aspects of the 
cooperation among units. The main briefing was given by 
Brigadier Gen. Manuel Lastres, with the participation of several 
members of the General Staff and commanding officers. The 
exercise also includes the participation of a command and 
control post of the provincial unified antiair system. This 
exercise includes tactical firing exercises by tank units in 
which artillery units, as well as small infantry units, will 
participate. 
  The tactical scenario is this: A unit located in a combat 
training range is put on air alert status following an enemy 
landing on the southern coast and is ordered to send two tank 
platoons forward to ward off the attack. 
  Moments before the beginning of the exercise, Colonel Nelson 
[not further identified] presented the distinguished service 
medal to First Lieutenant Luis Enrique Aguirre, an artillery 
unit commander, for successfully completing diverse missions. 
  These training exercises continue to be carried out with 
quality and a minimum of resources thanks to the implementation 
of diverse initiatives. On 24 June, the Western Army will 
conduct naval and air maneuvers.

<F P=106> [From the "NTV" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Ground units have successfully participated in the 
Moncada exercise held by the Western Army. Missile attacks were 
launched against a landing enemy force. The combat alert did not 
take the Orden Antonio Maceo Naval Base by surprise. The units 
deployed and quickly occupied combat positions. The mock battle 
against some 20 enemy ships only required the use of 50 percent 
of our forces. 
  The initial missile attack was launched against the landing 
boats. Our infantrymen acted calmly and with dedication to 
attain, in peace, the adroitness war demands. At a speed of over 
30 knots, a missile boat launched its weapons and returned 
victorious from its mission. 
  The Western Army Moncada exercise demonstrated today that 
the 
Cuban Revolutionary Navy maintains a high combat readiness and 
its troops are also a fist of steel against the enemy. This is 
why it has retained seven years in a row, the Revolutionary 
Armed Forces's Top Forward Unit status.

<F P=106> [Report by Marieta Cabrera from the "Exclusive" program] </F>
  [Text] The Western Army's Moncada II 94-1 exercise 
concluded today as an overall part of the command's operation, 
combat, and political preparation. The exercise sought to 
prepare general staff and command members to handle troops, as 
well as to organize the cooperation of regular forces and 
municipal defense councils in the region defended by the Western 
Army. 
  Moncada II 94-1 was based on a series of complex tactical 
exercises, which included ambushes, airborne landings by the 
enemy, and joint actions by the regular troops and other types 
of forces. Today's activities included a naval maneuver at the 
western base of Cabanas, preceded by maneuvers at the Jejenes 
shooting range with the participation of land and antiaircraft 
artillery and support troops. The exercise proved commanders' 
expertise in the deployment of small units which operate 
independently, their maneuverability, their accuracy, and 
efficient fulfillment of missions. Supported by initiatives, 
troop instruction programs were qualitatively carried out, which 
helped save materials and improve combat techniques.

  [Text] Pinar del Rio, Havana, Guantanamo, Las Tunas, and 
Granma Provinces have achieved their annual Territorial Troops 
Militia [MTT] fund drive targets through worker's 
salary-allotment donations. 
  Every province, including the Isle of Youth, has achieved 
over 80 percent of their MTT goals. The fact that Havana 
Province reached its annual fund pledge through volunteer work 
should be highlighted. 
  The Cuban Workers Federation's report, which is current to 
May, reveals that the tobacco union is the only one that has 
completed its MTT fund drive. 
  Approximately 90 percent of the salary-allotment donations 
for financing the MTT come from the Revolutionary Armed Forces' 
civilian workers, commerce, restaurant, sugarcane, metal, 
electronic, food industry, education, and sports workers.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Nestor Nunez from the "First Thing" program] </F>
  [Text] The phenomenon of the dollarization of the Cuban 
economy is leaving its mark at home, and I believe no one with 
any brains will disagree. I believe this is a necessary side 
effect. Yet, this does not mean we ought to let it be so, nor 
lie to ourselves and see the world through rose colored glasses 
when the street reality is not so. 
  The truth is that the possession of dollars in the midst of 
a 
widespread shortage crisis, such as the current one, opens the 
door to consumption options, that until now have been rare for 
the common citizen. And on occasion, this blinds the senses to 
the point that people put aside important values in order to 
attain hard currency. 
  It is a reality, at least that is my opinion. I based this 
on, among other things, the noticeable increase in prostitution 
and the transfer of qualified labor force to sectors where 
attaining hard currency is easier. It does not matter if it 
means going from being a professional to being a gardener or a 
chauffeur. Some of these people have told me that the bottom 
line is that right now a college degree does not get them what 
four or five dollars -- attained in a job with a much lower 
level of qualification -- do. 
  In diverse ways, this phenomenon continues to spread and 
corrupt. We must not forget, even for a moment, that there are 
people who assume certain attitudes forced by the need to, for 
example, buy a bar of soap or some milk to solve domestic needs. 
That the person who regularly sells export rum, such as the one 
that shocked me at the entrance of a shopping store, dressed in 
the latest fashion, is not the same as the housewife who, 
nearby, was selling a bottle of a lower quality liquor in order 
to buy -- she told me -- some cooking oil. Although their 
motives are different, both converge on efforts to attain hard 
currency which as the people say: Opens the door and eases 
today's difficult conditions. 
  I believe that this is a necessary side effect. Yet, I 
believe it is important that this phenomenon be seen in social 
terms and we should work as fast as possible to find 
alternatives more closely attuned to our goals to allow people 
to make a living according to their efforts and contributions, 
and not on the basis of other harmful criteria. 
  I believe we are going through a difficult and risky period. 
Undoubtedly, overcoming today's slump will leave negative scars 
on many people as a result, precisely, of the unavoidable steps 
we have had to take. Among these, the dollarization is one of 
the most worrisome. Once this bitter economic gulp is over, we 
will have to charge against the harmful habits and attitudes 
which this hour is spreading and which has resulted in certain 
people rendering ludicrous worship to fetishes and mechanisms 
incompatible with our overall goals.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon from the "First Thing" </F>
program] 
  [Text] The fail-safe policy of boosting incentive programs 
to reward the most efficient workers in certain economic sectors 
is an invaluable tool of motivation at times when the Cuban 
family is experiencing acute material shortages in terms of food 
and services, such as electricity, water, gas, and 
transportation. It was explained that work incentives were first 
introduced in selected sectors such as tourism, ports, repairs, 
electric plants, mining, and the sugar industry to mention a few 
examples. Given the shortage of resources, the idea of rewarding 
a greater number of sectors with larger incentives is out of the 
question. If the resources were available, however, it would be 
absurd to reward every worker equally regardless of their labor 
contributions. Although this type of argument is strong enough 
to not require further explanation, it is logical that those who 
endure daily limitations will take longer to understand this 
fail-safe policy. 
  Independent of the necessary understanding of the people, 
however, we need to listen to these who call for modest 
incentives at nonproduction workplaces that do not accrue hard 
currency. The idea of rewarding the most efficient workers at 
facilities that are not economically essential has merit if, 
from a realistic point of view, we acknowledge that some reward 
or modest services can also play a role while we wait for 
greater incentives. 
  It would be good to adopt such a policy in budgeted 
facilities on the basis of local or provincial initiatives 
resulting in modest incentives -- given their actual value -- to 
meet a number of current expectations. A center not related to 
production praiseworthy for its efficiency, where management and 
the union arranges for its workers and their relatives services 
such as shoe and home appliance repairs, a special lunch, or 
reservations at a leisure camp, will thereby motivate workers 
demoralized by the loss of their purchasing power. Other 
motivational formulas could stem from initiatives from sectors 
with unique characteristics such as health and education, where 
it is imperative to find mechanisms to reduce the personnel 
exodus. Management and the unions face an unexplored path they 
must now undertake. The effort, however, will be worth its while 
if simple incentive formulas, which do not burden the payroll 
budget, are found.

    [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 
at 1600 GMT on 24 June carries a 15-minute edition of its 
regularly scheduled "Straight Talk" program, with Renato Recio 
from TRABAJADORES newspaper, and host Osvaldo Rodriguez from 
BOHEMIA magazine, on the issue of differentiated incentives for 
diverse sectors of the economy. 
  Rodriguez opens the debate by stating that he has received 
many letters on today's issue, some in favor, some against, and 
others urging further explanation. 
  Recio states that it is not strange to see disagreements on 
differentiated incentives or material incentives given for 
production work. He adds that the people have an "egalitarian 
point of view" and that this is inadequate. Everyone agrees, 
however, that the appropriate distribution formula for the Cuban 
economy is the socialist formula: "Pay each person according to 
the quantity and quality of his work." He goes on to say that 
everyone agrees with this but that it is hard to put into 
practice. Recio adds: "The problem is when it affects someone 
who is not included among those that contribute the most in 
quantity and quality of work." 
  Recio adds that Cuba had not been able to fully apply a 
labor-incentive formula. He adds: "The situation now calls for 
a policy of incentives by sectors and individuals. There are 
other sectors that do not produce, materialistically speaking, 
but are important, such as the education and health sectors." 
  Rodriguez states that Cuban society fairly distributes all 
that there is to distribute but that, unfortunately, this cannot 
be transferred to the production sector. He adds that some of 
the letters received mention extraordinary efforts, but do not 
mention results. 
  Recio states that Raul Castro has stressed that efforts must 
be encouraged but only results must be rewarded. He adds: 
"There is a certain mind-set in Cuba that praises the man that 
exhausts himself in the effort, is seen uncombed, tired, and is 
turned into a hero. In a certain sense, heroism requires that 
exhausting effort, but that is not always synonymous with 
efficiency." 
  Recio goes on to say that production must precede 
distribution and that what little there is is being distributed 
with egalitarian criteria. The prioritized sectors -- tourism, 
sugar, petroleum, transport, mining, and others -- are to be the 
engines of the Cuban economy and the ones that ought to receive 
incentives. 
  Rodriguez points out that sectors involved in garnering 
currency could be considered prioritized sectors and that he 
believes that these incentives are not being utilized correctly. 
He adds: "I am thinking, for example, of those chain stores 
called shoppings. Some of the stores distribute equally among 
their workers what has come to be called a bag, which is no more 
than a monthly stock of products which are hard to come by in 
Cuba. This is distributed equally among the workers." 
  Rodriguez points out the example of the incentive programs 
implemented in the electric sector, where workers are rewarded 
for meeting certain standards. He stresses that egalitarian 
distribution of incentives "is once again dragging us back to 
the same situation we are trying to fight." 
  Recio states that to give all workers the same incentive is 
no incentive. He adds: "I believe incentives must be given 
within a sector, within a sector to a specific branch, within a 
branch to a specific enterprise, within certain enterprise to a 
specific factory, and within a factory to specific workers. I 
insist on the idea that the same incentive cannot be given to an 
indirect worker than to a worker involved directly with 
production." Rodriguez closes by stressing the importance of 
differentiated incentives to specific workers.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments monitored from Havana radio and 
television sources in Spanish between 18 and 25 June: 
  Radio Rebelde at 0900 GMT on 18 June reports that the 
Cienfuegos Province Finance Directorate's fine control office 
collected 1.1 million pesos in 1993. Their collection goal for 
1994 is 2 million pesos, 66 percent of which has already been 
collected. 
  Radio Rebelde at 0900 GMT on 21 June reports that the 
Ministry of Metal Industry reported that than more than 74,000 
bicycles were produced during the first five months of the 
current year. The aim is to exceed 250,000 units since 
production in Cuba started in 1991. Santiago Delgado, production 
director of the national organization of bicycles, said those 
numbers are very encouraging because despite current shortages 
in supplies, the 20 enterprises involved in production aim to 
fulfill the commitment of 300,000 bicycles. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1155 GMT on 21 June reports that the 
Govenment of India donated a full electric power project to 
illuminate a rural community of 120 homes in Santiago de Cuba. 
  Radio Reloj at 1952 GMT on 22 June reports that Pinar del 
Rio 
Province is the leader in the sugarcane planting program with 90 
percent of the goal fulfilled. The other provinces are lagging 
behind, thus Pinar del Rio has definite possibilities to meet 
its planting goals. 
  Radio Reloj at 1958 GMT adds that Holguin Province has 
experienced a slight economic recovery during the first five 
months of 1994. During this period, production revenues were 
aproximately 306 million pesos, 30 million more than during the 
same period in 1993. 
  Radio Reloj at 1959 on 23 June reports that the Basic 
Cooperative Production Units in Havana have planted 37 
caballerias of tubers, vegetables, rice, and beans for self 
consumption. 
  Radio Rebelde at 0900 on 24 June reports that Jose Luis 
Astrolea, president of the hydraulic resources institute, stated 
in Santiago de Cuba that Cuba currently has 185 
minihydroelectric units. Astrolea added that the goal, which is 
obtainable, is 600 units. 
  Radio Rebelde at 2300 GMT on 23 June reports that Bayamo's 
Farming Sciences Higher Institute and Guerrero State's 
Autonomous University, Mexico, have extended their cooperation 
program with the signing of a new cooperation accord. 
  Radio Rebelde at 2300 GMT adds that Guantanamo Province's 
Frank Pais contingent will mark its second anniversary by 
pledging to produce 500,000 million quintals of vegetables. 
  Cuba Vision Network at 0000 GMT on 24 June reports that 
following recent rains which affected the sugarcane harvest in 
Camaguey Province, six mills are currently grinding and workers 
are fully committed to repair the damage to the sugarcane fields. 
  Cuba Vision Network at 0000 GMT on 24 June adds that 86 
percent of the Cuban merchant fleet is operational despite 
current limitations. Two years ago, less than 60 percent was 
operational. Revenue of over 20 million in hard currency was 
attained by the fleet between January and May. A meeting held in 
preparation for October's Fourth Merchant Fleet and Port Union 
Congress focused on efforts to reduce costs and increase 
efficiency. It was also reported that over 400 crew members are 
employed in foreign vessels yielding revenue of over $2 million 
in salaries. 
  Cuba Vision Network, in the same newscast, adds that the 
American Freedom to Travel activists who arrived in Cuba in 
defiance of the travel ban brought along a donation, no figures 
given, of medicines and school supplies. 
  Radio Reloj at 0200 GMT on 24 June reports that increased 
weeding efforts are essential to improve the sugarcane yield. 
The Sugar Industry Ministry's plans include manually weeding 
more than 144,000 caballerias in the first half of 1994. It was 
announced at the 10-day harvest assessment meeting that Holguin 
Province surpassed its weeding goals and that Camaguey, Granma, 
and Las Tunas Province have made significant progress in this 
endeavor. 
  Radio Rebelde at 2300 GMT on June 24 reports that the 
Spanish 
Politurs Discount Tourism Agency has doubled its sale of trips 
to Cuba during the first five months of 1994 in comparison with 
the same period in 1993. This means that approximately 3,500 
Spanish tourists -- of the 14,000 expected in 1994 -- have 
already visited Cuba before the peak season in July and October. 
  Radio Reloj at 0200 GMT on 25 June reports that the 
Ibero-American Cooperation Institute has granted a $20,000 
donation to the Federation of Cuban Women, FMC, to modernize the 
documentation center of the FMC Cadres School. FMC President 
Vilma Espin attended the ceremony where the first $10,000 of the 
donation was issued to the FMC. 
  Radio Reloj at 0200 GMT on 25 June adds that the six Basic 
Cooperative Production Units in Nueva Paz Municipality are 
behind schedule in the spring planting of diverse crops with 20 
caballerias planted out of a 49 caballeria program. The delays 
were due to, among other things, excess humidity in the soil, a 
shortage of tires, and weeds. Candido Palmero, first secretary 
of the Communist Party of Cuba in Havana, pointed out that if 
this situation continues, the planting goal is not going to be 
met, and added that a Youth Labor Army farm will be created to 
help with the labor. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 25 June reports that Cuba 
signed 
an accord with the UN program for population stability and 
family planning. The United Nations will contribute over 
$700,000 and Cuba will contribute over 2 million pesos to the 
effort. Raul Taladrid praised the UN contribution.

  [Text] The Jonassaint government is planning elections. 
The provisional government issued a press release following a 
ministerial council meeting on 22 June expressing its 
determination to make all the necessary arrangements for 
national elections as soon as possible and in compliance with 
the concerned institutions. No dates have been set for the 
elections or for the necessary steps to prepare for the 
elections. 
  [Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio in French at 1030 GMT on 24 
June reports: "Government sources have reported that the 
Jonassaint government will have to summon Permanent Electoral 
Council members next week to discuss national elections. On 17 
June, provisional President Emile Jonassaint said that holding 
elections is the only honorable way out of the crisis and that 
elections will prove democracy can come to Haiti. Attorney 
Mireille Durocher Bertin of the National Coalition agrees and 
has suggested that a team be organized to open the files 
necessary for holding elections in Haiti in the next few 
months."]

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Daly Valet] </F>
  [Excerpts] Many people might consider U.S. Government 
officials, both past and present, the leaders of the putschists 
and the leaders in stalling tactics, following the failure of 
the Washington and Governors Island agreements. If the United 
States truly controls everything in Haiti, an important step has 
been taken with Bill Clinton's latest decisions. This important 
step has caused many Haitians problems, lavalassian [Aristide 
partisan] and putschist alike. If you (?doubt that), go to Rue 
des Miracles and see the Bank of Boston; if you go to Delmas 18, 
you will see that the Bank of Nova Scotia is closed; if you go 
to Citibank on Delmas Road, you will see that all its doors are 
closed. Not one penny is available to the Haitians, regardless 
of their political positions. Consequently, many people (?are 
angry). You can visit parliament in the meantime. 
  The U.S. Government has revoked the green cards and visas of 
many legislators who set up Jonassaint's de facto government. 
The visas and the green cards of Thomas Eddy Dupiton, Dejean 
Belizaire, Bernard Sansaricq, Osny Eugene, and Romel Manigat 
have been revoked. 
  Sen. Dupiton says he did not expect the United States to 
take 
such a step since he has always considered it a democratic 
country, a country where all citizens' opinions are respected 
even though they differ. [passage omitted] 
  Many Haitians who are used to traveling abroad say that Sen. 
Sansaricq has many businesses in the United States, so you can 
imagine his discontent. Sen. Dupiton has relatives, children, 
and so on. The Artibonite senator admits that he regrets 
nothing, even though he considers the decision to cancel his 
green card unjust. [passage omitted] 
  Not all legislators close to Jonassaint have had their visas 
revoked. Some of those who have not been hit by the measure, 
such as Margareth Martin, say, however, they are waiting their 
turn. This 18 January, legislators protested the fact that many 
of her Senate colleagues have been hit by the measure because of 
their political positions. Margareth Martin blames the decision 
to revoke visas on senators close to President Aristide. Sen. 
Martin says they are the senators who used to point accusing 
fingers at legislators who do not side with the 
president-in-exile: 
  [Begin Martin recording] It is scandalous that the U.S. 
ambassador or the U.S. Embassy cancels the immigrant visas of 
Haitian citizens who support the government. I have yet to 
receive my letter; I am waiting for it; I am waiting for them. 
They can revoke my visa and take back their green card. I will 
stay in my country and help establish democracy. [end recording] 
  [Signal FM adds in a report in French, during the same 
newscast: "President Emile Jonassaint's provisional government 
issued a communique on 23 June noting that foreigners from 
countries that require Haitian nationals to have visas will be 
required to have a visa to enter Haitian territory. This 
measure concerns U.S. citizens and Canadians, who did not need a 
visa to enter the country before now. The French have been 
obliged to hold visas for several years, as a sign of 
reciprocity with Paris. The government communique states that 
foreigners will have to pay a $50 tax upon arrival at Haitian 
ports and airports."]

  [Text] The two U.S. banks operating in Port-au-Prince -- 
First National of Boston and Citibank -- closed their doors on 
23 June, following U.S. President Bill Clinton's executive order 
freezing Haitian assets in U.S. banks. These two banks had been 
operating in Haiti for 20 years and ranked fourth and fifth, 
respectively, out of the nine foreign banks operating in Haiti. 
These banks operate under and are subject to Haitian law. A 
reliable financial source has reported that a judicial 
injunction compelling them to reopen or to return their 
customers' assets should reach them in the next 48 hours.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 24 Jun (EFE) -- Today, Haitian Lower 
Court Judge Henock Voltaire ordered two U.S. banks, which had 
closed their doors to the public in view of U.S. President Bill 
Clinton's decision to freeze Haitian citizens' accounts, to 
reopen on 27 June. 
  Voltaire issued this decision following a suit filed by the 
Central Bank of Haiti. This decision affects Citibank and Bank 
of Boston branches, which on 22 June notified the Central Bank 
governor of their decision to stop operations. After this 
measure was implemented, the two banks did not open their doors 
on 23 and 24 June. Many citizens went to the banks on those two 
days to try to withdrew money. 
  Judge Voltaire maintained that these two banks cannot close 
their doors due to decisions made by the United States; they are 
subject to Haitian laws because they requested authorization to 
operate in Haiti. He also pointed out that their arguments do 
not have merit in Haiti; hence, they will have to reopen. It 
was reported that the Bank of Boston will open its doors on 27 
June. Meanwhile, no Citibank spokesman could be located to 
respond to Judge Voltaire's decision. 
  Political observers believe the U.S. objective of 
implementing financial sanctions to force the military regime to 
relinquish power has worked against the United States because an 
anti-American feeling prevails in Haiti. 
  Meanwhile, operations at the Scotia Bank proceeded as 
normal, 
but many people went to this bank to withdraw money, fearing the 
bank might close its doors to the public.

<F P=106> [By Anais Chavenet: "Haitian Business Sector's Initial </F>
Reaction to Latest U.S. Economic Sanctions Rather Hostile" -- LE 
NOUVELLISTE headline] 
  [Text] Indignation, anger, caustic or furious comment, 
vague impulses for reprisal: The business sector in 
Port-au-Prince is not stomaching U.S. President Bill Clinton's 
latest decision to freeze the assets and property of Haitians 
and that of legal Haitian institutions and organizations. 
Tension mounts as a list of the names and addresses of about 
300 people, including minors in some big families, who are being 
targeted circulates throughout the capital. 
  "My granddaughter is on that list," a well-known attorney 
says indignantly. 
  "It is madness," says one banker. "I have nothing to do with 
those friends right now," he adds. 
  One citizen believes that Clinton has gone too far, while an 
attorney denounces the arbitrary nature of the executive order 
the U.S. head of state signed late on 21 June. "It is the 
strong hand in its greatest splendor." This U.S. measure 
reminds him of the practice under the Duvalier regime of a whole 
family being punished for the actions of one. It is funny to 
hear the international community talking about rights 
considering that relations with the international community have 
been based on force since 30 September 1991, he said. 
<H5>  Boomerang Effect </H5>
  It is a cold shower: Many of those who are penalized do not 
show any sign of turning on the military authorities, as the 
United States expected. 
  "I will turn on them if they were wrong at 10 percent," says 
this banker, who thinks that the protagonists on both sides 
should resign. [sentence as published] He deplores the embargo 
and does not seem to agree that those who staged the coup d'etat 
are responsible for it. "They are wasting their time because we 
have not forgotten Aristide's `stones in water' and `give them 
what they deserve' statements." 
  A young professional, furious at being penalized, shouted: 
"If it's a matter of money or my life, I prefer my life; if it's 
a matter of money or Cedras, I prefer money." He is not ready 
for upheaval, however. He rages, jumping on the first foreigner 
he meets. More coldly, his father points out that Clinton's 
measures "increase the hate for Americans." Reconciliation is 
impossible with such measures, measures that only serve to set 
Haitians against one another to the point of civil war. 
<H5>  American Banks Can Just Pack Up </H5>
  To make things worse, the two U.S. banks in Haiti -- 
Citibank 
and Bank of Boston -- closed their doors today, some observers 
feel to avoid pressure from their customers. U.S. Marines have 
reportedly helped secure Citibank. It has already been rumored 
that the Bank of Boston will reopen its doors on 24 June. It is 
said that the Bank of Boston has a strong Haitian clientele now 
at bay. More than one person wonders: Will the checks be 
cashed? 
  People are preparing to take legal action to force Citibank 
and the Bank of Boston, subject to Haitian law, to refund their 
assets. This possibility was raised in the 14 November 1980 
decree, modified by the 14 July 1984 decree, on commercial 
banks. Article 71 authorizes the Bank of Haiti to relinquish 
them, especially when they suspend payments. Relinquishment 
means the state can assume the bank administrators' authority. 
Article 26 allows the finance minister, on the Bank of Haiti's 
request, to revoke the authorization under which these banks 
operate. 
  One businessman is pleased that he withdrew his assets from 
the Bank of Boston two years ago. "Both banks can just pack up 
and leave. Not one lucid Haitian will deposit his money there 
anymore." 
  U.S. financial institutions also take a risk. "The U.S. 
banks are certainly going to lose their customers," an attorney 
asserts, convinced that the "great fortunes" were safeguarded a 
long time ago. One analyst points out: "The United States has 
lost its chance to be considered a land of investment."

  [Text] An officer accompanying General Cedras has reported 
that the Army commander in chief toured various military 
garrisons in the metropolitan area in line with the state of 
emergency. He told us that the Army chief made it a point of 
presenting an overall view of the situation to the officers and 
the soldiers. The Army's number-one-in-command also wanted to 
lift troop morale and ask them to prepare for anything. 
  The officer added that Gen. Cedras took the opportunity, 
while visiting the barracks, to denounce, quote, the 
international community's emotional, irrational, and immoral 
role in managing the Haitian crisis. Gen. Cedras visited the 
naval and aviation corps, heavy machines, the National Palace, 
the Military Academy, and the Croix-des- Bouquets barracks. 
  It should be noted that sandbags have been placed near 
Port-au-Prince Police Headquarters, preventing traffic from 
entering nearby streets. This measure was taken in response to 
the Jonassaint government decree outlining various strategic 
zones.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 25 Jun (EFE) -- Haitian Army chief 
Raoul Cedras continued visiting the country's military 
installations while the economic sanctions against the Caribbean 
nation remain in effect. General Cedras visited the Military 
Academy, the Dessalines Barracks, and the Haitian Navy 
installations on Friday. 
  Cedras, the leader of the coup d'etat that overthrew 
constitutional President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, criticized the 
international community for its "immoral" attitude toward Haiti. 
The Haitian Army chief has called on the troops to be ready to 
take action in case of any emergency or foreign intervention. 
  For the past few days, on Cedras' orders, security measures 
have been tightened at the barracks, and "strategic zones" have 
been established to which civilians may not get close. 
  Air traffic between the United States and Haiti should be 
suspended this weekend as part of the tightening of sanctions 
against the country's coupist regime following several weeks of 
constant departures of foreigners from Port-au-Prince. Some 
people, who were waiting to board a plane to leave Haiti last 
night, could not do so despite having confirmed reservations 
with Haiti's "Trans Air" airlines. Meanwhile, Haitian citizens, 
who were in the United States, and some foreign journalists 
arrived in Port-au-Prince aboard an "American Airlines" flight 
coming from Miami. 
  The Center for Free Enterprise and Democracy (CLED) in 
Haiti, 
mostly made up of young businessmen, protested the new economic 
sanctions imposed by the United States against the Caribbean 
island. The CLED criticized the drafting of a list of 
businessmen who would face sanctions without prior warning and 
without the possibility of resorting to lawyers. 
  This week, U.S. President Bill Clinton decided to freeze the 
bank accounts of all Haitians who have money in U.S. banks and 
live in Haiti. According to the CLED, this is an "immoral" 
measure. The CLED said the people adversely affected are not 
responsible for the crisis in Haiti. In a communique, the CLED 
stated it is unfair to punish people just because they belong to 
such and such a family. The CLED also spoke in favor of the 
restoration of constitutional order and state of law in Haiti. 
According to the CLED businessmen, the attitude of the United 
States and the international community is to "drown" Haiti. The 
document issued by the CLED, dated 24 June, states that the U.S. 
Government is acting in an "illegal and hypocritical" manner 
against Haiti. The CLED believes the measures approved by the 
United States seek to divide the private sector and inspire 
society to go against the businessmen.

  [Text] St. Lucia has been given a clean bill of health from 
major international organizations, such as the International 
Monetary Fund. This was revealed last evening by one of the 
island's representatives at the just-concluded World Bank 
meeting in Washington. Speaking on the discussion program 
"One," broadcast on Helen Television System, government Senator 
(Charmaine Gardner) painted a bright picture of St. Lucia: 
  [Begin (Gardner) recording] I happen to have been in 
Washington last week, at the World Bank meetings, and we were 
told there by both the World Bank, by the International Monetary 
Fund, and by many other funding agencies who happen to have been 
at that meeting that St. Lucia was one of the countries in the 
eastern Caribbean, in fact, from Guyana all the way north to 
Jamaica, more than the eastern Caribbean, in the entire 
Caribbean region -- St. Lucia was one of the countries who were 
doing very well. 
  St. Lucia had one of the best country reports given by both 
the IMF and World Bank and many of the other funding agencies. 
We were told that, in terms of our management, our economic 
management, management of our fiscal policy, our annual growth 
rate was between 4 and 5 percent; that the norm for countries 
like the United States is something like 4.5 percent; that our 
country's debt burden, in terms of its ratio to repayment, was 
also good; and that we need to maintain our annual growth rate; 
and that one of the ways in which we had arrived at the annual 
growth rate of about just over 4 percent and one of the ways in 
which we need to maintain that annual growth rate was that our 
economy had, by and large, been private-sector driven and that 
some of the greatest levels of import into the economy were by 
not only the traditional private sector but by the tourism 
industry and, in some sectors, by the agricultural industry, 
where there were areas of privatization and agroindustry. [end

  [Text] The Trinidad and Tobago Government will soon adopt 
legislation to regulate competition and to minimize unfair 
trading practices. Minister of State and Industry Ken Valley 
says decades of protectionism have led to a lack of 
international competitiveness. He gives the assurance, however, 
that in opening up the market to private enterprise, the 
government would protect the economy from monopolies through an 
effective competition policy. The minister was speaking at the 
Seminar on Competitive Policy and Restrictive Business 
Practices. The highlight of this event was a panel discussion 
on the subject. Representatives of the manufacturing sector 
debated the issue with (Philip Busic), of the UN Conference on 
Trade and Development [UNCTAD]. Debbie Deganz reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Deganz] The question arose whether the 
size of a country's economy affects its ability to compete 
internationally. Chief Executive Officer of the TTMA [Trinidad 
and Tobago Manufacturers' Association] (Clive Teluxing) thinks 
so. And while he supports the theory of free trade, he would 
also like to see a policy framework in place before the doors 
are opened to foreign competitors. 
  [(Teluxing)] We have, in Trinidad and Tobago, a situation 
and 
laws that are geared to assist manufacturers to achieve that 
kind of level playing field in Trinidad and Tobago, and we are 
saying look, let's strengthen these laws, put teeth into the 
laws, and let's strengthen the administration of those areas. 
  [Deganz] But the UN representative maintains that since 
liberalization is worldwide, all countries, especially small 
ones, must protect themselves by ensuring a strong policy 
governing competition. The aim, says Mr. (Busic), is not to 
discriminate against foreign firms but to treat everyone equally. 
  [(Busic)] The aim of competition policy is not to stop 
monopolies, per se, but, in fact, it is to ensure that 
monopolies act as if they were under the pressure of 
competition; to avoid that enterprises sleep on their 
comfortable, single supplier position; that to avoid that 
enterprises provide bad service, ineffective, inefficent, 
noninnovative, and do not respond to the needs of the consumer. 
  [Deganz] The speed with which government should pursue the 
liberalization process came up for debate. While both the TTMA 
and UNCTAD agree that it should be a gradual process until the 
legislation is in place. Gene Hutchinson, of the Bureau of 
Standards, says we have run out of time. He says local 
companies need foreign competition to bring their products up to 
international standards. 
  [Hutchinson] And once you can compete successfully with the 
imports, in fact, you can then export to those markets. That's 
the name of the game. That's [words indistinct] you do not have 
the time. The game has gone past. 
  [Deganz] It was agreed that once the proper legislation is 
in 
place, the competition process will naturally weed out the weak 
companies, leaving those efficient enough to survive an 
international climate. [end recording]

  [Text] The former head of the Trinidad and Tobago 
Manufacturers' Association [TTMA], (Gordon Rosseau), says NAFTA 
has nothing to offer Trinidad and Tobago at this point in time. 
In fact, (Rosseau) is of the belief that the government's plan 
to accede to NAFTA can only be seen as destructive to the 
island's manufacturing sector. Denise Moore has the details: 
  [Begin recording] [Moore] Mr. (Rosseau) says the perception 
that NAFTA is synonymous with free trade is a mistaken one. He 
refers to one asymetrical clause, designed to protect American 
industries which are larger than the entire economies of some 
Caribbean countries. 
  [(Rosseau)] If we are to join NAFTA now, we are not going to 
be joining NAFTA under the rules and regulations that those 
three countries joined NAFTA. And I'm saying that if...[pauses] 
I'll have to put myself out on a limb here: Assuming that our 
government is sensitive to the manufacturing industry and 
assuming that the 40,000 jobs and the $400-odd-million in 
revenue in exports is important and assuming that we have a 
place in the future diversity of this economy, then I don't 
understand why it is we are forcing and we are rushing into 
NAFTA in a destructive mode. 
  [Moore] The former TTMA president says NAFTA embodies the 
concepts of protectionism and selective intervention. These are 
practices, he says, which it seems this government is reluctant 
to put into place. The manufacturer echoes the concerns of 
former head of the Institute of International Relations at St. 
Augustin, Professor (Anthony Brian), when he questions local 
ability to effectively bargain in the nation's interest. 
  [(Rosseau)] You look at the Venezuela agreement: five years, 
nonreciprocal trade. But I see some items on that list there, 
airplane wings, propellors for boats, things that we don't ever 
dream to get into. Those are the items that have preference for 
duty-free trade. I look at the list for the Colombian agreement 
that has just been signed. Again, none of the strength that we 
have in our exporting products are on that list for duty-free 
trade. Some are on a phased period, and some are to be 
negotiated in time. 
  [Moore] Mr. (Rosseau)'s fears appear to be vindicated by 
Prof. (John Butrick), of York University. Reflecting on the 
experience of the Canada-U.S. free trade agreement, Prof. 
(Butrick) says NAFTA has already gutted the entire manufacturing 
sector in Ontario. 
  [(Butrick)] It was clear from the beginning why this would 
happen. Ontario was selling across all of Canada. If you live 
in BC [British Columbia], and they suddenly say: We're going 
free trade. Will you continue to buy from Ontario? Or would 
you go somewhere where it's cheaper? 
  [Moore] Prof. (Butrick) says that the movement toward a 
competitive world economy will eventually erode national 
sovereignty. In his brave, new world, sovereignty will be 
replaced by market forces and nations will become powerless to 
control their own economies. And senior lecturer in the faculty 
of social sciences, Patrick Watson, feels this country and 
Caricom [Caribbean Common Market] should not limit their vision 
geographically. He feels Europe may offer more possibilities 
because of its historic ties to the region. All the speakers 
agree, though, that there is no hurry to join NAFTA, 
particularly since Latin America offers so many opportunities.

  [Text] Defense Minister General Humberto Corado yesterday 
condemned the threats made by self-styled "revolutionary" 
groups, saying they are more likely the product of sick minds 
that want to maintain unrest in our country. 
  "It is condemnable that at this time there are sick minds 
that use anonymous statements to spread terror and generate 
unrest," Defense Minister Gen. Corado said yesterday, referring 
to an anonymous statement that purports to be a "communique by 
the Salvadoran Revolutionary Front," which has circulated in San 
Salvador. The statement includes deaths threats against several 
members of the cabinet and people from democratic sectors under 
the pretext that "if something happens to the people threatened 
by the `Domingo Monterrosa Command,'" they will take reprisals. 
  Gen. Corado said no one has proven the existence of the 
so-called Monterrosa Command, which is most certainly a ruse by 
the same leftist groups, just as it happened with the so-called 
Maximiliano Hernandez Martinez Brigade. It is most likely that 
they, the so-called "radical left," want to get rid of certain 
people and are grandly "condemning them to death" to then 
"execute them and take reprisals." Leftists of the Mao Zedong 
line invented this tactic. The official said anonymous groups 
are trying to besmirch the name of Colonel Monterrosa, who is 
regarded as a national hero. 
  "As soldiers living in a time of peace, we must condemn all 
violence promoted by any sector, regardless of its affiliation," 
he stressed. 
  To declare this or that place "a military objective" will 
only generate distrust and make life impossible for a government 
that is struggling to maintain peace," Minister Corado said. 
[no opening quotation mark as published] 
  "We as soldiers regret that there are still some sick minds 
circulating these kinds of anonymous statements," the ranking 
officer said.

  [Text] President Armando Calderon Sol says the security 
corps have intensified their efforts and have changed their 
strategy to deal with an increase in crimes. In the past few 
hours seven people have been killed in San Salvador alone. The 
president also said the alleged organizational support of 
criminal gangs will be thoroughly investigated to identify those 
people involved in supporting the gangs and to bring these 
criminal supporters to justice. 
  President Calderon Sol said that, as a result of the bank 
robbery, security measures have been doubled to fight the crime 
wave that has proven the existence of organized crime in El 
Salvador. 
  [Begin Calderon Sol recording] All necessary measures are 
being taken beginning with the implementation of a different 
course of action for the National Civilian Police as well as for 
the National Police under the coordination of the public 
security deputy ministry. The purpose is to confront this 
regrettable situation that is taking place in the country -- 
this wave of crimes perpetrated by common criminals and also by 
organized crime. [end recording] 
  The president said that appropriate investigations are under 
way and that there are clues about the possible perpetrators of 
the spectacular bank robbery. He added that the results of 
these investigations will be disclosed in due time by the deputy 
public security minister. The president said his government is 
also investigating the gangs' alleged support organizations. 
  [Begin Calderon Sol recording] We are going to uncover these 
organizations and get to the bottom of this. We have to conduct 
a very thorough investigation to stop these crimes and to 
eliminate organized crime in El Salvador. [end recording] 
  The president said the law will be applied against those 
involved in these crimes because his administration has a deep 
commitment to eliminating this disgrace from society.

  [Excerpt] San Salvador, 25 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- A clandestine 
group, consisting of civilian crime victims, has claimed 
responsibility today for the execution of at least 18 members of 
holdup gangs during the past six months. 
  A member of the "New White Hand" ["Nueva Mano Blanca"], a 
name used in the past decade by a so-called "death squad," has 
told NOTIMEX the victims were "executed" in San Salvador and in 
areas of the outskirts for their involvement in holdups. 
  A spokesman for this group, which emerged last January, 
explained his organization consists of approximately 80 
civilians, including women, who have been victimized by criminal 
gangs. He has said that his group is not responsible for the 
attacks on or murders of politicians and that its mission is to 
fight crime "due to the authorities' inadequate actions to 
eradicate it." He added the group uses 9-mm pistols to "execute" 
gang members. The police have reported more than 50 criminal 
gangs are operating in San Salvador. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Today in Oslo, Norway, government and URNG 
[Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] representatives signed 
an agreement that establishes the foundations for the creation 
of the Truth Commission. The agreement underscores the need to 
promote a culture of harmony among Guatemalans, and it 
establishes that one of the commission's goals will be to 
establish, with impartiality and equality, responsibility for 
human rights violations perpetrated as a result of the internal 
armed conflict. 
  During a visit to Roosevelt Hospital today, President Ramiro 
de Leon Carpio expressed satisfaction over the signing of the 
agreement with the URNG, whereby the Truth Commission will be 
established. 
  [Begin De Leon recording] A few hours ago, an agreement was 
signed; it is among the many steps that have been taken, 
starting with the national peace plan presented by the 
government. 
  As you know, the national peace plan consists of three 
parts: 
reconciliation; the solution of the Guatemalan people's economic 
and social needs or, in other words, the struggle against 
poverty; and third, the conclusion of the internal armed 
conflict. 
  Regarding the first part -- reconciliation and the 
establishment of a permanent forum for peace -- we agreed to 
form a temporary assembly of civilian representatives. This 
assembly will be headed by Monsignor Rodolfo Quezada Toruno. 
With regard to the second part, we are making great efforts to 
combat poverty, and when the internal armed conflict ends, we 
will face a new challenge -- the biggest challenge of all -- 
which will be the elimination of the injustices and economic and 
social circumstances that are hurting the Guatemalan people. 
Regarding the third part, I am very pleased to say that 
starting this year, based on the national peace plan we 
presented to Guatemala and the international community, we have 
fulfilled all of the points. 
  In January, we signed the framework agreement, which opened 
this new phase of the process. In the framework agreement, both 
sides agreed to sign a peace agreement this year. Subsequently 
in March, we took a big step forward by signing the General 
Human Rights Agreement, from which emerged the Commission for 
Historic Clarification [Comision de Esclarecimiento Historico -- 
CEH]. This is a very significant agreement, because in the past 
human rights had hindered the peace process. We also signed the 
agreement on immediate international verification, which is 
another big step forward. 
  Today is a historic day for Guatemala because, believe me, 
never before have we encountered such an inherently complex 
matter. Today's event is a significant step that truly brings us 
closer to peace. Before this, we signed a schedule that clearly 
outlines each phase -- phases we are fulfilling. The 
international community is pleased with the administration's 
true political resolve and also with the resolve of the 
Guatemalan Army, which has unquestionably played an important 
role in this matter, not only because it is directly involved, 
but also because of the issues that directly affect the 
institution. 
  In this case I can say that we are adhering to the schedule 
and that a historic step was taken today in Oslo on the issue of 
displaced people, which also was a big step forward. This is 
perhaps the greatest and most gratifying event for us. I must 
tell you that the agreement under which the Commission for 
Historic Clarification will be established has certain 
characteristics. In the first place -- and this is fundamental 
-- it has been established that this commission must explain 
possible human rights violations in detail, but its 
recommendations and reports will not personalize responsibility 
or be used to initiate legal proceedings. 
  This is the main issue, I believe, because it is in keeping 
with the entire philosophy of the agreement. The document does 
not advocate revanchism; on the contrary, from the very outset 
it calls for an end to the armed conflict, thereby establishing 
the foundations for peaceful coexistence with respect for human 
rights in Guatemala. It underscores that it is necessary to 
promote a culture of harmony and mutual respect that will 
eliminate every form of revenge and retribution. This is the 
central philosophy of this agreement, and it is an essential 
condition for firm and lasting peace. 
  The CEH was not agreed to intensify our pain or to 
constantly 
make us look over our shoulders. Anyone who constantly looks 
over his shoulder can easily trip and fall. The purpose of the 
commission is to strengthen peace and make it lasting. 
Meanwhile, another of the agreement's main goals is the 
objective of equitable and impartial clarification of human 
rights violations and violence that took place over a number of 
years during the internal armed conflict. 
  As for the formation of the CEH, the news agencies have 
already informed you how we agreed to do this. The UN secretary 
general will be asked to appoint the current peace talks 
mediator as a member of the commission. A citizen of 
irreproachable standing, and one who is approved by both sides, 
will be appointed by the mediator. Finally, an academician will 
also be selected by the mediator, in conjunction with the two 
sides, from a list of three candidates proposed by university 
rectors. 
  The commission will be installed and will begin to function 
on the day the firm and lasting peace agreement is signed. It 
will work for six months and can be extended for an additional 
six months. This deadline is deemed to be sufficient to conduct 
an investigation and issue a report. This means that within no 
more than a year following the firm and lasting overall peace 
agreement, the commission will present its report. 
  I must stress that the commission will prepare its report 
within the established period, but, perhaps, the main issue is 
that we have agreed on a central philosophy that opposes revenge 
and retribution; on the contrary, it seeks reconciliation, 
forgiveness, and a new phase in Guatemala by way of a commission 
that will prepare a report that will prevent us from again 
experiencing or suffering the violence of the past. It is clear 
that the commission has duties that prevent the personalizing of 
responsibilities or taking legal action. During the course of 
this period we will find the mechanisms with which to make an 
agreement possible. [end recording]

<F P=106> [News conference by Defense Minister Mario Rene Enriquez </F>
with unidentified reporters on the agreement reached by the 
Guatemalan Government and the General Command of the Guatemalan 
National Revolutionary Unity, URNG, to create the Commission for 
Historical Clarification, CEH; place and date not given; 
broadcast in progress -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Enriquez] ...a historical event. As President 
Ramiro De Leon Carpio visited -- I believe -- the Roosevelt 
Hospital, he was asked the same question. I believe my reply 
will be the same. I must tell you that the Guatemalan 
Government's political resolve is shown once more. Reaching a 
full and lasting peace is our objective. We believe the work 
done by the government's peace delegation in Oslo was excellent. 
I congratulated them for their almost 15 days of hard work. I 
can tell you from experience that this type of work is 
exhausting. However, this work was not completed in vain, 
because we took two more steps toward achieving the peace we all 
desire. 
  [Reporter] Is the Army satisfied with the agreement reached 
by the government and Army representatives? 
  [Enriquez] I do not think any military members disagree with 
accepting and signing certain agreements. What we are doing 
here has national resonance, and those things that could affect 
the Army have institutional resonance. I refuse to believe 
someone will place his personal interests above national and 
general interests. As I said earlier, this situation does not 
prevail in the Army. Of course, there may be someone who is 
unsatisfied because it was once said that the Army would never 
hold talks with armed groups. This was even said at Esquipulas 
II. However, the Guatemalan Army is an institution that always 
respects the Army General Commander's mandates. On that 
occasion, it was said that there were going to be talks with 
subversives, and we held talks with them. There are even Army 
members currently holding talks with subversives. From the 
institutional and my personal point of view, I can tell you that 
the two agreements are good enough to lead to reconciliation and 
peace in Guatemala. 
  [Reporter] Have the objectives of the Guatemalan armed 
conflict been accomplished by creating this commission? You 
said on repeated occasions that there would not be an avenging 
commission? Could you.... 
  [Enriquez, interrupting] ....I believe you are completely 
right. We always said, even when I was a member of the Peace 
Commission, that the CEH [Commission for Historical 
Clarification], which was initially called the Truth Commission, 
did not intend to seek revenge. Its goal was to learn what 
really happened to ensure that new generations will not make the 
same mistakes and to prevent Guatemalan society from becoming 
polarized to the extreme of starting to kill each other again. 
These last 34 years have been very painful years of mourning, 
death, deception, and polarization. It has been a very long 
night for Guatemala; we now believe a dawn is coming for 
Guatemala. The CEH meets the equanimity, justice, and 
impartiality requirements, but, above all, the commission seeks 
no revenge. This is why the cases will not be handled 
individually, but collectively. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Minister, what can be concluded from a number 
of recommendations made by General Victor Manuel Argueta 
Villalta? 
  [Enriquez] In reference to what? 
  [Reporter] In reference to his statement that those sectors 
that wanted to question him legally lacked moral authority. 
  [Enriquez] I think the Guatemalan Army, as a legitimate 
armed 
group established to defend the State, fulfilled completely its 
constitutional duties during these 34 years. All Guatemalans 
must be proud of the Guatemalan Army because thanks to this 
Army, this legendary Army with high morale but very poor 
resources, Marxist-Leninism was not established in Guatemala. 
  If it were not for the Guatemalan Army, we would now be 
regretting the establishment of Marxist-Leninism in Guatemala. 
Because of the Guatemalan Army, we have a better Guatemala. It 
is not as developed as it could have been if the subversives had 
not undermined progress in Guatemala. However, we anticipate a 
better Guatemala. We must all recognize that there is poverty 
in the country, and we must work to achieve better standards of 
living for all people. We, Guatemalans, must work to achieve 
this goal. We cannot sit around and wait for money and 
happiness to come from the heavens. We must all work harder and 
with greater integrity, tolerance, and understanding to attain a 
happy society in Guatemala. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Minister, changing the subject, the human 
rights ombudsman has requested that the Army defend the 
sovereignty of Guatemala, which is being challenged by Belize. 
Will you do this? 
  [Enriquez] That is our duty. We will fulfill our 
obligations, but we also know Belizean reality and the reality 
of what is currently taking place. I know this reality first 
hand because I have traveled there, and if necessary, I will go 
there again. 
  There is no problem between Belize and Guatemala at this 
time. There are no definite borders; there is [word indistinct] 
between El Peten and Belize. This situation will have to be 
defined according to the recommendations made by this newly 
installed Belize Council, as stated by the foreign minister and 
the president. This Council will conduct a study and will make 
recommendations to the president on a referendum or popular 
consultation to end this territorial claim of Guatemala, which 
is recognized by Belize, England, and the world. 
  [Reporter] Meanwhile, what will the Guatemalan Army do about 
the threat from Belizeans to expel Guatemalans, whom you had a 
chance to visit, from the neighboring area? Is there Guatemalan 
Army presence there? 
  [Enriquez] We have soldiers there; there are also soldiers 
from the Belizean Army. We have talked to the Guatemalans 
residing there. They have not been forced to leave the area. 
We coordinated efforts with the INTA [National Institute of 
Agrarian Reform] president. The commander of Military Zone No. 
23 is aware of these efforts, and he was instructed to assist 
these people. But they will not be removed from the area. 
  [Reporter] [question indistinct]? 
  [Enriquez] This cannot be done. That could create a more 
serious conflict in the area. 
  [Reporter] What will happen if the Belizean Army wants to 
expel these Guatemalans? This is our concern. 
  [Enriquez] My answer to that is the following: The chief of 
the Belizean Army spoke to [name indistinct] Rodriguez, and he 
told him that they were not interested in evicting these 
Guatemalans. He said that they should leave once they obtain 
land, that they will be offered transportation to move to their 
own land, and that they will not be moved from one place to the 
other. They will leave that area, which is an ecologically 
protected area. There is a Maya cemetery in the area. 
  [Reporter] In the meantime, you will not allow that they 
be... 
  [Enriquez, interrupting] Listen, our main duty is to protect 
our fellow citizens, and we will give our lives for our fellow 
citizens. You can rest assured of this. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Minister, going back to the Truth Commission 
issue, people's sectors have expressed violence could increase 
while [words indistinct] is approved. What is the opinion of 
the Army? 
  [Enriquez] Well, the accords for the creation of the 
Commission were already approved and signed. 
  [Reporter] Yes, but these groups fear violence may increase 
before the Truth Commission begins operating. 
  [Enriquez] I know this Commission will begin working 
immediately after the final accord is signed.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 25 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Government of 
"Honduras rejects an invasion of Haiti," a high-ranking Honduran 
official has told U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry and 
Southern Command Chief General Barry McCaffrey. 
  Honduran Vice President Walter Lopez Reyes told NOTIMEX that 
"Honduras disagrees with a forceful invasion of Haiti" and that 
he voiced this position to the U.S. military leaders who arrived 
in Honduran territory today. 
  Perry and McCaffrey arrived at the Palmerola Military Base, 
where they met with Foreign Relations Minister Ernesto Paz, 
Government Minister Efrain Moncada Silva, Vice President Walter 
Lopez Reyes, and Armed Forces Chief General Luis Alonso Discua 
Elvir. 
  Lopez Reyes made assurances that the government of President 
Carlos Roberto Reina would be willing to cooperate with a 
mission to restore peace in Haiti requested through a UN or OAS 
resolution. He said that military leaders in the Clinton 
administration have never asked Honduras to support an invasion 
and that they only requested our "opinion" on the Haitian 
situation. 
  Another topic discussed by the Honduran and U.S. officials 
was the future of the U.S. base in Palmerola, located in the 
central Department of Comayagua. This installation was built in 
1983 when anti-Sandinist armed groups in Nicaragua, known as 
"contras," used Honduran territory as a base to launch their 
armed operations with U.S. financing and aid. 
  This base legalized the U.S. military presence in Honduras, 
and its construction cost over $30 million. "We talked about 
the future of Palmerola as a regional counternarcotics training 
center," Lopez Reyes pointed out. Honduras is unable to 
maintain this base, and thus, the vice president admitted that 
it could hardly be transferred to Honduran hands. Palmerola 
will also be used by the U.S. National Guard and Army Reserves 
to train in engineering and civilian-military operations, Lopez 
Reyes added. 
  He denied that the United States will transfer to Honduras 
the 82d Airborne Division, which invaded Grenada in 1983, 
because there has been no thought of transferring the Southern 
Command (headquartered in Panama) to Palmerola, as was reported 
in this capital. 
  U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry will head for Puerto 
Rico today, after visiting Panama and Honduras, and he will 
return to Washington on Sunday.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 26 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- The Honduran 
Government is prepared to send military forces to maintain peace 
in Haiti, Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar said today, 
although he does not agree with a military invasion of that 
Caribbean nation. 
  The diplomat said his country is prepared to join a 
multinational peacekeeping force in Haiti, as it does in Western 
Sahara, where it has a small military contingent. 
  The situation in Haiti was one of the topics the foreign 
minister discussed on 25 June with U.S. Secretary of Defense 
William Perry, who is wrapping up in Puerto Rico today a visit 
that included Panama and Honduras. 
  Paz Aguilar reiterated Honduras will not accept a massive 
inflow of Haitian refugees, because it did that two years ago 
with 250 Haitians who were taken to the Bonito Oriental sector 
in the Caribbean region of this country. There are still 
approximately 26 Haitians in that area who would like to go to 
the United States or Canada. The refugees sparked certain 
disturbances in the Bonito Oriental sector. Honduras would like 
the situation to return to normal in Haiti, where the military 
toppled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide two years ago, the 
foreign minister said.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, Jun 25 (AFP) -- After a meeting between 
Honduran Government officials and U.S. Defense Secretary William 
Perry today, it was officially reported that the United States 
will install a regional center to counter drug trafficking 
activities in Honduras. 
  The Pentagon's number one man met with Honduran Armed Forces 
Commander General Luis Alonso Discua, Vice President Retired 
General Walter Lopez Reyes, and Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz 
Aguilar at noon today. The meeting was held at Palmerola, a 
military base that was constructed in 1982 and is located 84 km 
to the north of Tegucigalpa. There are approximately 1,000 U.S. 
soldiers stationed at Palmerola. 
  Perry arrived in Honduras this morning after visiting Panama 
and traveled to Puerto Rico later in the day. The United States 
must withdraw approximately 10,000 Southern Command soldiers 
from the Panama Canal area by December 1999 at the latest. 
Perry said the withdrawal from Panama had prompted them to 
consider transferring several air units to Palmerola. He said, 
however, that "in general, all the military installations in the 
region are being reduced because of geopolitical changes." 
  Honduran Foreign Minister Paz reported, however, that "this 
issue had not been discussed" at the meeting with Perry and that 
"Honduras is not going to become a military platform" for the 
United States. "I believe the U.S. policy, at an international 
level, is to close bases and to decrease the number of their 
soldiers stationed abroad. I do not believe they are interested" 
in increasing their presence in Honduras, Paz asserted. 
  The Honduran minister added that, at the meeting with the 
U.S. secretary, it was agreed within the framework of a treaty 
to establish a regional center in Honduras to counter drug 
trafficking" and that Honduras would want the center to be 
located at Palmerola. 
  "It is clear that Honduras has to redefine its relations 
with 
the United States based on dignity," Paz observed, alluding to 
several reforms to the 1954 U.S.-Honduras military treaties that 
were proposed by the Honduran Government several months ago. 
The presence of the U.S. troops in Honduran territory is 
included in those agreements. According to the foreign minister, 
the issue "was broached in a very preliminary manner" during the 
meeting with Perry.

<F P=106> [Report by Juan Pritsiolas and Carlos Vargas] </F>
  [Excerpts] The U.S. Government has again announced it is 
offering a $100,000 reward for the capture of three Panamanians 
-- among them the son of Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) 
President Gerardo Gonzalez -- who have been charged with the 
murder of U.S. soldier Zak Hernandez. Meanwhile, Gonzalez 
claims the reward is part of a "blackmail campaign" being waged 
against him. 
  The State Department has published advertisements in several 
Panamanian newspapers offering a reward to anyone who comes 
forward with information on the whereabouts of Pedro Miguel 
Gonzalez, Roberto Garrido, and Daniel Batista, who have been 
charged with Hernandez's murder and the wounding of another 
Southern Command soldier. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, Gerardo Gonzalez says the State Department 
intends 
to use his son as "a scapegoat to attack and blackmail me." 
  The PRD leader also accused the judicial branch of thwarting 
his son's constitutional rights by not allowing him to retain a 
lawyer for the trial in the murder case of soldier Zak Hernandez. 
  According to Gonzalez, Pedro Miguel's only role in the 
events 
that took place during former U.S. President George Bush's visit 
was his participation in the demonstration that took place at 
Porras Plaza. 
  The Zak Hernandez case was investigated by the Fourth 
District prosecutor, who requested that Pedro Miguel Gonzalez, 
Roberto Garrido, and Daniel Batista stand trial. Second 
District Judge Sandra Huertas De Icaza will assess the merit of 
the arguments. 
  Initially, the authorities arrested three other people 
accused of taking part in Hernandez's murder, but they were 
later acquitted. None of the three Panamanians sought by the 
State Department has retained defense attorneys, because the 
courts have not yet accepted the powers of attorney extended by 
their relatives to a group of attorneys.

  [Text] Sources within Molirena [Nationalist Liberal 
Republican Movement] have disclosed the decision by the party's 
Political Committee to maintain an independent criteria and not 
join a "constructive" alliance in opposition to the government 
that will be installed on 1 September, as proposed by Arnulfist 
Party [PA] President Mireya Moscoso de Gruber. 
  According to the queried sources, the Political Committee 
has 
said during the next government it would support the positions 
by any other group as long as they are beneficial to Panamanians 
and the country in general. Molirena has believed that if an 
alliance is created, it should not be until the actions of the 
next government are known. 
  Eduardo Linares, PA leader and planning and economic policy 
deputy minister, has said the people of Molirena do not feel the 
need to create an alliance to oppose the next government now. 
He added his party will continue to support a "constructive 
opposition alliance." 
  He has said that the PA members hope the next government 
will 
choose the best course for the country and that the PA will take 
it to task if it does not. If things are done for the good of 
the country, "we will support it." 
  Acting President Guillermo Ford met at the Palace of the 
Herons on 20 June with the PA president and top leaders, and 
Mrs. Gruber proposed to the Molirena members who were present 
they create a constructive alliance in opposition to 
President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares' government. 
  Mireya Moscoso de Gruber explained her party is actively 
working to maintain an attitude critical of the actions of the 
next government. The PA rejected an offer by the 
president-elect to participate in the structure of the 
government that will take office in September.

  [Text] Washington, 24 Jun (NA) -- President Carlos Menem 
said today that relations between the United States and 
Argentina "are going through the best of times." Menem also 
spoke about the possibility of sending more ships to help in 
Haiti's political and economic blockade. 
  Menem made these comments during a news conference at the 
Argentine Embassy in Washington after his meeting with his U.S. 
counterpart, Bill Clinton, at the White House. 
  During most of the news conference Menem answered questions 
on international matters, which were at the center of his talks 
with Clinton today. 
  Menem considers himself a guarantor of peace and democracy. 
He also mentioned issues that will be discussed in the 
hemispheric summit in Miami. 
  "We discussed the Haitian situation, the next American 
continent summit meeting in Miami," the president said. Menem 
added that Argentina is ready to contribute to any decisions 
made by the UN Security Council. 
  Speaking about the hemispheric summit, Menem said: "It will 
center on three main items: democracy and its most important 
result -- freedom, trade, and continental security. Other topics 
might be added later." 
  Menem said he is sure economic sanctions against Haiti will 
yield good results, adding that he is "always speaking about 
political and economic measures." 
  Menem said there are two ways Argentine troops can be sent 
to 
Haiti, where a dictatorial government prevents elected 
authorities from taking over. 
  "The first case is presidential prerogative. The president 
can send troops anywhere in the world to keep the peace. This is 
the case in Croatia, Cyprus, and Haiti. In Haiti we are 
contributing to the embargo. The president needs congressional 
approval if troops will be involved in combat situations," Menem 
added. 
  The president said that during his meeting with Clinton the 
two leaders discussed "the most worrisome current issues, which 
includes the case of Haiti. We agreed on the need to increase 
pressure in the political and economic areas to force the 
withdrawal of the military from the government." 
  The president said he was optimistic about a possible 
resolution of the international problem created by the North 
Korean refusal to deactivate its nuclear programs. 
  "I learned today that U.S., North Korean, and international 
organizations' representatives will meet next month to try to 
solve the problem," Menem said. 
  The president also was asked about Brazil's annoyance at 
Argentina for its support of Mexican President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari to head the World Trade Organization. 
  "I recall that Argentina supported Carlos Salinas de Gortari 
based on a Colombian request made at the Ibero-American summit. 
I was not aware then of the Brazilian position on the issue," 
the president explained. 
  Menem added: "Brazil proposed the candidacy of Mr. [Rubens] 
Ricupero, a successful economist in Brazil. Therefore, at this 
time there are two candidates, and the decision is in the hands 
of World Trade Organization members. [no closing quotation mark 
as received] 
  Regarding the issue of Haiti, Menem said pressure against 
the 
dictatorial government could include actions in the financial 
field. 
  "These measures will affect the entry of capital and assets, 
but the decision will be made by the United Nations. As 
guarantors of democracy and freedom, we will support them 
immediately," Menem said enthusiastically. 
  The president added: "The international community, through 
the United Nations, must take steps as quickly as possible when 
a country does not live in democracy, when people are killed 
everywhere, and when there is hunger and misery because of it."

  [Text] Washington, 24 Jun (NA) -- President Carlos Menem 
today cracked some jokes about his Cuban counterpart Fidel 
Castro. He said Castro "is becoming more modern: He changed his 
combat fatigues for a light shirt [guayabera]" during the recent 
summit of Ibero-American heads of state and heads of government 
in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. 
  In response to a journalist's question on the Cuban leader's 
change of dress, Menem said: "It is a good omen that leads us to 
believe Cuba will soon be democratized." 
  Menem emphasized that he responded with a joke the 
journalist's question because "this style of dress suits him 
well and makes him look younger." 
  "I said it with all respect and with all my affection for 
the 
president of Cuba," said Menem, who for the first time used the 
word "president" for Castro. He previously referred to him as 
"the commander." 
  Menem later told the journalists that, during his meeting 
with U.S. President Bill Clinton, "the Cuban issue was not 
discussed." 
  Menem held informal talks with Castro in Colombia. He 
referred to the Cuban issue during a news conference at the 
Argentine Embassy in this city after meeting with Clinton at the 
White House.

Agreement (NAFTA), which comprises the United States, Canada, 
and Mexico. 
  Menem, who arrived in Buenos Aires this morning after an 
official seven-day visit to Canada and the United States, told 
reporters the decision "depends on the invitation extended to 
us." 
  The president described as "very good the mission 
accomplished" in the two North American countries, adding his

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 26 Jun (DPA) -- Argentine President 
Carlos Menem praised bilateral relations with the United States, 
anticipated Argentina's prompt joining of NAFTA, and called the 
opposition's request for a political trial of Economy Minister 
Domingo Cavallo "outrageous." 
  Upon arriving in the capital following a trip to the United 
States and Canada, Menem said that "the decision about Argentina 
joining NAFTA has practically been made," but everything 
"depends on the invitation extended to us," he said. 
  Menem said his meeting with his U.S. counterpart Bill 
Clinton 
at the White House on 24 June was very significant, and that his 
meeting with former U.S. President George Bush was very "warm 
and affectionate." 
  As for the request by the Radical Civic Union [UCR], the 
main 
opposition party, that Cavallo, who drafted the current 
adjustment plan, be brought to political trial, Menem said that 
action cannot be taken just because the minister interpreted a 
law. 
  Former Argentine President Raul Alfonsin, current UCR 
leader, 
told the UCR deputies' faction leader to ask for a political 
trial of Cavallo following his interpretation of the extension 
stipulated by Congress to choose between private or state 
retirement. 
  Despite the 90-day extension to opt for the distribution [de 
reparto] or capitalization plan approved by the legislature, 
Cavallo announced last Friday that those who did not choose 
before 1 July would be registered in an administrating board for 
private retirement funds. 
  Opposition legislators challenged Cavallo's interpretation 
and expressed their concern that the executive branch would not 
promulgate the law approved by Congress before 1 July, when the 
deadline expires. 
  Menem stressed today that he will decide the issue of the 
extension for choosing a retirement plan.

Lisbon, the meeting of the chiefs of state and government of 
Portuguese-speaking countries, which should have taken place in 
Lisbon tomorrow, was canceled. 
  Portuguese President Mario Soares yesterday telephoned 
President Itamar Franco to inform him that the presidents of 
Cape Verde and Angola would also not attend the meeting, and 
would send representatives instead. In view of this Mario 
Soares decided to cancel the meeting and postpone it to another 
date. The chief of the Brazilian delegation would have been 
former President Jose Sarney, and four ministers were to travel 
with him. 
  Brazilian Ambassador to Portugal Jose Aparecido de Oliveira 
did not like this cancellation, as he was one of the greatest 
enthusiasts of the meeting and of the principal point on its 
agenda: the unification of the Portuguese language. 
  Up until the very last moment Jose Aparecido tried to make 
President Itamar Franco change his mind and attend the meeting. 
When he did not convince him, Jose Aparecido became furious.

<F P=106> [Article by Helena Tachinardi from Brasilia] </F>
  [Text] The Senate Economic Affairs Committee yesterday held 
a public hearing to discuss the draft bill regulating 
intellectual property rights (trade marks and patents). 
Entities opposed to intellectual property rights on 
pharmaceutical products and biotechnology objected to the text 
recently approved by the Uruguay Round of GATT talks. 
  GATT's "TRIPS" ("Trade Related Intellectual Property 
Rights") 
agreement, which in the next few days will be sent to Congress 
for ratification, was defended by Ambassador Roberto Abdenur, 
Foreign Ministry secretary general; by Interfarma, the 
association representing 39 foreign pharmaceutical laboratories; 
and by Jose Roberto d'Affonseca Gusmao, president of the 
National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI). 
  Senator Jose Richa (PSDB-PR) [Brazilian Social Democracy 
Party, Parana], Economic Affairs Committee project coordinator, 
invited entities interested in the subject to present their 
objections. He said he wants to improve the version of the bill 
produced by the Chamber of Deputies, and confessed that the 
project is causing him more difficulties than any other in his 
28 years of public life. 
  Senator Antonio Mariz (PMDB-PB) [Brazilian Democratic 
Movement Party, Paraiba State], rapporteur for the Constitution 
and Justice Committee, has not yet submitted his report. 
According to his advisers, the tendency is to leave the bill's 
discussion until after the evaluation of the GATT agreement on 
intellectual property has been approved. Meanwhile, this 
position is not defended by the government. Guzmao has said 
that "Brazil needs a law that is independent from the GATT 
agreement." 
  The national pharmaceutical laboratories, represented by 
Alanae [expansion unknown] and the Brazilian Association of 
Refined Chemistry [Abifina], want a 10-year grace period for the 
law's implementation in accordance with the GATT guarantee. The 
bill, which was approved in 1993 by the Chamber of Deputies, 
limits the grace period to one year, which is to begin once the 
new legislation is approved. 
  Abdenur said that "TRIPS is an unavoidable handicap" and "we 
cannot give ourselves the luxury of ignoring it." He also 
stressed that it was the result of an international consensus of 
125 countries. Congress cannot amend the GATT treaty; it can 
only approve or reject it. 
  Nelson Brasil, Abifina president, and Marcus Vinicius 
Pratini 
de Moraes, president of the Brazilian Trade Association (AEB), 
supported by other organizations, have indicated that it is not 
the concession of patents that will bring foreign investment to 
the country, and that only economic stability can do that. 
  Pratini favors the approval of a law that would contain 
GATT's ideas, and expressed his concern regarding greater U.S. 
retaliation, which has cost the paper and pulp industry some 
$300 million over the past few years. If the United States 
excludes Brazil from the Generalized System of Preferences [GSP] 
because of the patent problem, Brazil could lose $75 million, he 
warned. Pratini has called for the approval by Congress of a new 
trade defense law. On 23 June he submitted a draft bill in this 
respect to senators and to the ministers for foreign affairs, 
industry, commerce and tourism, and finance. 
  Francisco Teixeira, Interfarma's representative, who spoke 
in 
the name of the 39 foreign pharmaceutical laboratories that are 
installed in the country, defended the modifications that had 
been made in the draft bill, such as: clear and ample protection 
for biotechnology; patent exploitation for locally manufactures 
and for imports; compulsory licenses only as an exception 
(calamities, abuse of economic power); banning of parallel 
imports; and protection for the products that are not introduced 
into the Brazilian market ("pipeline"). [preceding word in 
English] 
  The government has already submitted its suggestions for 
amendments to rapporteurs Mariz and Richa, who have not yet 
submitted their opinions to their respective committees. The 
amendments have taken into account the GATT's TRIPS agreement. 
The Senate's Economic Affairs Committee has received numerous 
letters from organizations criticizing the patenting of new 
sectors such as pharmaceuticals, food, biotechnology, and 
chemistry.

  [Text] Paris, 24 Jun (AE) -- If it were up to Luiz Inacio 
Lula da Silva, the Angra-2 nuclear plant would not be built. 
The PT [Workers Party] presidential candidate made this 
commitment during talks he held today in Bonn with 
representatives of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation. During a 
recent visit to Bonn, Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim 
had assured German Government officials interested in the 
progress of that plant that it would be built. 
  Yet Lula and Marco Aurelio Garcia, the external area 
coordinator of the PT program, did not succeed in convincing 
German businessmen. They were both evasive regarding foreign 
trade financing and the PT approach to the foreign debt. The 
representative of the Deutsch Sud Amerikan Bank walked out of 
the room in protest over Lula's confusing positions about the 
Brazilian reality. 
  In a meeting with German Vice Foreign Minister Helmut 
Schafer, Lula stated that a PT government would honor all of the 
agreements signed by Brazil regarding nuclear nonproliferation 
and the missile control regime.

  [Text] Paris, 23 Jun (AE) -- PT [Workers Party] 
presidential candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and German 
businessmen will hold a working breakfast on 24 June. Lula will 
tell them that he intends to finance his economic program 
through the creation of solidarity funds. 
  Although the Lula administration will seek agreement with 
the 
richest sectors of Brazilian society, it will also tax large 
fortunes by regulating existing constitutional article. For 
Lula, who arrived in Bonn this evening, this is not a new 
measure; it is in practice in several European countries, 
including Germany and France. 
  One of the main concerns of the German reporters who met 
with 
Lula today was how an eventual PT administration will treat 
foreign investments. "I want investments that will produce 
results in the social field. Germany is a good example of 
this," Lula said. Nearly all German investments in Brazil are in 
the productive sector. 
  Today in Mainz, Lula met with Rudolf Sharping, president of 
the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), with whom he 
discussed the foreign debt. PT government platform coordinator 
Marco Aurelio Garcia calmed Sharping by saying: "The PT 
criticizes the foreign debt agreement signed by the Brazilian 
Government, but will respect it as long as it does not affect 
our exchange reserves or our government program financing." The 
PT government program requires funds to fight unemployment and 
misery, and to help education and the land distribution problem. 
  Even though the PT belongs to Socialist International, it is 
contacting the European Social Democratic parties which are 
traditionally closer to the PDT [Democratic Labor Party] of 
Leonel Brizola and the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] 
of Fernando Henrique Cardoso. SPD President Rudolf Sharping was 
unable to explain quite why his party financed the trip of the 
PT candidate and his delegation to Europe. Sharping merely said 
the SPD is open to contacts with other Brazilian political 
parties. Lula said that although the PT does not belong to the 
Socialist International, it has always maintained good relations 
with the German SPD and other European social democratic parties 
which are concerned with social aspects.

<F P=106> [Article by Celso Pinto: "Lula Sparks Fears of `Nasserism'"] </F>
  [Text] Senior military officials are concerned about a 
possible victory of Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the Workers Party 
[PT] presidential candidate, for various reasons. One of the 
most serious reasons -- although not openly discussed -- is the 
fear that a "Nasserist" type movement may emerge. 
  This was one of the topics addressed by a senior officer 
close to high-placed government officials during a recent 
meeting he held with more than 10 leading businessmen. The 
conversation was open, and the tone was pessimistic and full of 
warnings about the future. He conveyed a clear message: The best 
option for businessmen is to finance the candidates who could 
defeat Lula at the ballot boxes. 
  A crucial point of the officer's analysis is that, in the 
implementation of its program, the PT could lead Brazil to an 
institutional impasse. He noted that even moderate PT sectors 
have criticized the fact that Lula's government program has not 
taken into account the role of Congress in outlining its 
projects, despite the fact that the PT program envisages major 
changes "that will bring about confrontations within society," 
the officer said. 
  It is believed the PT will fall well short of a majority 
bloc 
in Congress. In practice it will have to deal with a 
conservative Congress "and there will be an institutional 
impasse." There is nothing new in the officer's prediction. He 
said that something similar occurred in 1963 and 1964, when then 
President Joao Goulart sought to impose his "basic reforms" on a 
conservative congress. 
  When the impasse occurs, he says, Brazil will either plunge 
into "lawlessness" through an anarchic process or enter "an 
arbitration process" through "the action of mediators." The new 
ingredient is right here. The "mediators," quoting the officer, 
would be the military, although without fulfilling the role they 
had in 1964. The "destructuring of the Army" could provoke an 
intervention that may not be led by senior officers linked with 
a conservative project, but by middle-level officers, in a 
"Nasserist" type process. 
  The officer thus alluded to the process through which then 
Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser and his "young Turks" took power in 
Egypt in 1956. That is, a type of armed intervention advocating 
nationalism and a planned economy. Although the officer did not 
say so, it appears he was hinting that this type intervention 
could be done in coordination with the PT or with leftist 
sectors. 
  The officer acknowledges that Lula is more tilted toward 
moderate PT groups and that, if moderate sectors prevail in the 
government, there will be no impasse. The problem, he said, is 
that there is no way of guaranteeing that the radicals will be 
kept on the sidelines. 
  He described the PT program as "intimidating." For instance, 
the PT wants to implement an agrarian reform through 
expropriation of land in an area equivalent to three times the 
size of Alagoas State at a cost of $20 billion. Reforms are 
necessary, he said, but in a "gradual, cautious" process. 
  Furthermore, the officer believes, irrespective of who is 
elected president, Brazil faces severe structural problems that 
the constitutional revision process could have solved. Without 
these changes, he said, it will be much more difficult for any 
president to rule the country. 
  There will be a type of "legal anarchy" provoked by the 
autonomy enjoyed by lower echelons, by the strangling of the 
federal budget through tied and poorly used allocations, by the 
"inverted stability" of public employees whereby job security is 
granted to uneducated employees who could be hired on the market 
and not to administrative officials of state-owned and 
self-financed companies -- who are massively replaced with each 
government or ministerial change -- and by the possibility of 
public servants calling a strike, which is not prohibited by the 
Federal Supreme Court. 
  As can be predicted, the businessmen fully endorsed the 
officer's analysis. The doubt, one businessman said, is that it 
remains to be seen who is the best anti-Lula candidate, either 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso or Orestes Quercia, a subject which 
was not discussed. 
  What this type of meeting reveals, irrespective of whether 
the analysis of the officer is correct or not, is that Lula has 
to go some to bridge the gap that separates him from more 
conservative, and strong, business sectors and overcome the 
distrust he still provokes among military leaders.

  [Text] Brasilia -- For the first time since he began his 
campaign for the presidency, PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy 
Party] candidate Fernando Henrique Cardoso admitted the 
possibility of losing the elections to PT [Workers Party] 
candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. During a meeting he held 
with President Itamar Franco on 21 June, Cardoso made an 
objective analysis and expressed his fear that Lula may win in 
the first voting round. 
  "I do not doubt I will be the candidate with the second-most 
votes in the first voting round; but then there may be no second 
voting round," Fernando Henrique said during his conversation 
with Franco. 
  "Fernando's main concern lately is that Lula may win in the 
first voting round," said Senator Pedro Simon (PMDB-RS) 
[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Rio Grande do Sul], who 
attended the meeting. 
  On account of this concern, Cardoso decided that until the 
first voting round he will not attack contenders like Esperidiao 
Amin from the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party], Leonel Brizola 
from the PDT [Democratic Labor Party], and Orestes Quercia from 
the PMDB. The strategy is not to harm these candidates now so 
they can attract votes from Lula. 
  "I will not attack anyone now. Their candidacies must grow 
so 
Lula will not win in the first voting round," Cardoso said. 
  Cardoso on 22 June asked Senator Jose Sarney (PMDB-AP) 
[Amapa] to help him in Congress so the Real Plan will not be 
modified. He made this petition informally during a meeting in 
the Senate cafeteria where they chatted for 10 minutes 
accompanied by Senator Jonas Pinheiro (PTB-AP) [Brazilian Labor 
Party], a candidate for Amapa governor, who reported on their 
conversation. 
  Jonas Pinheiro believes Sarney is inclined to support 
Cardoso, but not immediately like the PSDB and PFL [Liberal 
Front Party] want. 
  "I feel that he will support Cardoso but Sarney is cautious. 
He wants to be sure," Pinheiro said. 
  Cardoso again said that eventual support from the former 
president will be welcomed, but he will not "aggravate" any 
politician to support his candidacy. 
  "I am campaigning among the people. Sarney is a responsible 
individual. He must make his own decision," Cardoso said.

  [Text] The government yesterday rejected the PRC decision 
to conduct a new nuclear bomb test, and also the DPRK's 
reluctance to allow inspection of its nuclear installations by 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  The PRC decision has led the Chilean Government to summon 
the 
PRC diplomatic representative today. Special Policy Director 
Pablo Cabrera will express to him the government's concern. 
  Concerning the North Korean position, it was reported that 
Chile cosponsored the IAEA resolution that imposes drastic 
sanctions, including the withdrawal of assistance to programs 
for the peaceful use of nuclear energy, except for aspects 
related to medicine. 
  The IAEA was assisting North Korea with $240 million for 
such 
programs. 
  The Chilean Government reaction to these two situations is 
in 
line with its traditional position and with instructions from 
President Eduardo Frei on the matter. 
  A clear step was taken in this regard on 18 January of this 
year when Chile, a signatory of the treaty proscribing nuclear 
weapons in Latin America, became an active member of the 
Tlatelolco Treaty, in order to begin immediate negotiations with 
the IAEA seeking agreement on safeguards through which all its 
activities in the nuclear field would be subjected to control by 
the IAEA. 
  The government has been following attentively what has been 
happening in North Korea. In addition to the North Korean 
position, which is repudiated by Chile, is the fact that this is 
a Pacific Rim country with which excellent political and 
economic relations have been maintained. 
  Due to international pressure the DPRK Government had 
recently announced its immediate withdrawal from the IAEA, thus 
making even more remote any international control of its nuclear 
activities. 
  The North Korean reluctance to allow international 
inspections has been one of the factors, not to say the main 
one, preventing a stronger bilateral relationship. 
  The tension generated by the sanctions imposed by the IAEA, 
and the statements made by the United States, Japan, and South 
Korea, have prompted fear that the confrontation could become 
aggravated or even lead to war. 
  It is a dangerous situation, but "the real interpretation" 
made by the Chilean Foreign Ministry is that it is not as 
dramatic, as it considers the tough North Korean position to be 
a subterfuge aimed at obtaining a greater advantage in 
negotiations. 
  Special Policy Director Pablo Cabrera will convey today to 
the PRC diplomatic representative the Chilean Government's 
concern over the PRC decision to test a new nuclear weapon in 
the Lop Nor testing ground, in the western province of Xinjiang. 
  In a public statement lamenting the PRC decision, the 
government states that this explosion can be added to another 
explosion conducted by the same country last year. 
  "The Chilean Government hopes, once again, that these 
nuclear 
tests will end definitively, seeking to achieve the total 
proscription of nuclear weapons for the benefit of international 
peace and security, a hope much desired by mankind now that we 
are on the doorstep of the third millennium," the note ends.

  [Text] President-elect Ernesto Samper has asked THE MIAMI 
HERALD to correct its position, and President Cesar Gaviria 
expressed his support for the president-elect. 
  [Begin recording] [Gutierrez] For the first time, President 
Gaviria talked about the attempt to infuse the presidential 
campaigns with drug trafficking money, as detailed by the 
recordings he received from Andres Pastrana four days prior to 
the elections. 
  [Gaviria] All Colombians want a thorough investigation to 
yield results soon in order to dispel doubts. 
  [Gutierrez] President Gaviria expressed support for the 
president-elect, who announced that, should he find out that any 
member of his team is involved, he would dismiss him from any 
post he might occupy in the government. 
  Meanwhile, Vice President-elect Humberto De la Calle, who is 
a member of the Promoters Committee for the Penalization of Drug 
Consumption, said the new administration will relentlessly fight 
drug traffickers. 
  [De la Calle] First, we will continue the military and 
police 
fight against drug traffickers. 
  [Gutierrez] There will also be new laws to penalize money 
laundering and appropriations. [end recording] 
  [Madrid EFE in Spanish at 0059 on 25 June transmits a 
175-word Santa Fe de Bogota-datelined report citing De la Calle 
as saying: "It will become a fight to arrest and make drug 
traffickers pay the debts they owe to Colombian society." The 
report adds: "The new government will submit two bills to 
increase drug traffickers' prison terms by means of a reform of 
the Penal Code, thereby closing the gap on `certain legal limbos 
and loose interpretations' that let criminals enjoy prison terms 
shorter than the ones they deserve. De la Calle also pointed out 
that the new administration will make money `laundering' a crime 
in Colombia and will seek international cooperation to trace the 
routes travelled by illegal money."]

<F P=106> [Report by the Ricardo Canon from "The Midday Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] The next administration, through Vice 
President-elect Humberto de la Calle Lombana, today expressed 
its fullest support for President Cesar Gaviria in his 
initiative to call a referendum as the only solution to 
challenge attempts to decriminalize drug consumption in the 
country. 
  [Begin De la Calle recording] President Gaviria's proposal 
to 
call a referendum to reform the Constitution stems precisely 
from situations that we have observed. We, too, have questions 
about this ruling which today is a legal reality that can only 
be removed from the Colombian judicial scene by improving the 
Constitution. We applaud the government's decision on this 
issue. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, President Cesar Gaviria believes there is no way 
to implement Constitutional reforms other than through popular 
participation. 
  [Begin Gaviria recording] There is no other possible option, 
because, while it is true that, in the opinion of the court, the 
judicial measure allows legislators to regulate matters related 
to age, place, employment, and some other activities in which 
drug consumption takes place, unquote [as heard], this is not 
enough to ban or penalize drug consumption as a rule, which in 
our opinion should be the case. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Fabio Valencia Cossio, president </F>
of the Colombian Conservative Party's National Directorate, by 
unidentified reporters; place not given -- live] 
  [Text] [Reporter] Mr. Valencia, has the Conservative Party 
taken a position with regard to its possible cooperation with 
Ernesto Samper's liberal government? 
  [Valencia] First we want to praise the extraordinary 
election 
day activities led by Andres Pastrana on Sunday in which more 
than 3.5 million votes were secured, within the framework of a 
big partisan movement that has created a balance of power in the 
nation. The Conservative Party, as you know, is a traditional 
party, which is permanently in force, has a hierarchy, and 
obviously participated very actively, very strongly, and with 
very good results, through a major partisan movement, during 
Andres Pastrana's presidential campaign. 
  The National Directorate will meet today to assess the 
electoral results and to highlight the work of the Conservative 
Party. We want to express our appreciation to all the directors, 
congressmen, deputies, councilmen, and party leaders, in 
general, because the party truly had an extraordinary and 
historical day. Within that order of priorities, we are 
analyzing the positions the president-elect has been presenting. 
  Obviously, in accordance with that attitude, we are going to 
make a decision in this regard. For starters, from a democratic 
point of view, we recognize Ernesto Samper's victory. We wish 
him success, because what we want is for Colombia to succeed. 
  [Reporter] As president of the National Directorate of the 
Conservative party, I would like to say that the Conservative 
Party provided enormous support at the voting tables. 
Nevertheless, there are those who pose this question: Will the 
Conservative Party let itself be absorbed by the democratic 
force represented by Dr. Pastrana and his supraparty ideology, 
or will the Conservative Party begin reorganizing its followers 
as an alternative to power? 
  [Valencia] I believe that neither Dr. Pastrana nor we are 
interested in losing the Conservative Party's historical stance. 
I want to give an explanation to ensure that the country will 
understand the structural differences between the Liberal and 
Conservative Parties. The Liberal presidential candidate and the 
party leadership became confused, while by national convention, 
we elected Andres Pastrana as part a large supraparty movement. 
  [Reporter] Dr. Valencia, let me fulfill a commitment we have 
every day at 0730; we can then continue with this conversation, 
which is very important because many political sectors are 
anxiously waiting for it. 
  [Valencia] Of course, Carlos. 
  [Reporter] We were talking with Fabio Valencia, the 
Conservative Party's National Directorate president. He was 
answering an important question, which I will repeat to Dr. 
Valencia. 
  [Reporter] Will the Conservative Party now reassume an 
alternative-power position or will it continue participating in 
the New Democratic Force [NFD]? 
  [Valencia] I believe we must make a distinction at this 
point. The Conservative Party is a permanent and historic party, 
with its own hierarchy and legal identity. Out of conviction, we 
took Andres Pastrana as the supraparty candidate, and we 
participated as part of the NFD. In the case of the Liberal 
Party, the candidate and the head of the party were the same 
person. In our case, we chose our president and a supraparty 
president, whose participation and national leadership were 
undisputed. The Conservative Party chose a candidate, but the 
party's leadership remained with its national directorate, and 
its legal representation [words indistinct]. As I said before, 
the structures of the parties are different. The Conservative 
Party is obviously intact, and it has a clear representation in 
Congress. I reiterate: We are ready to continue working on 
behalf of the country and promoting the ideas of change 
advocated by Pastrana during his campaign. 
  [Reporter] Would the Conservative Party collaborate with 
President Samper instead of the NFD, or, vice versa, would 
Pastrana's followers and the NFD collaborate with Samper instead 
of the Conservative Party? 
  [Valencia] There is a very significant circumstance at this 
point: Andres Pastrana represents half of all Colombians, who 
chose him for his ideas and leadership. From this angle, no one 
can deny the significance of the Conservative Party. The 
Conservative Party, considering the political 
hierarchy--Pastrana noted it last night--is not in his hands, 
but in ours, and we are working on this basis. 
  [Reporter] Therefore, that decision is yours and not 
Pastrana's. Do you believe that the Conservative Party should 
participate in the government? 
  [Valencia] We, together with all the friends of the 
Conservative Party, are studying the situation. We will hold 
consultations with all the parliamentarians and will meet with 
the National Directorate today. We are waiting to see the 
attitude of President-elect Samper, because he has the first say 
on this. The ball is in his court. 
  [Reporter] Consequently, Dr. Valencia, would you be willing 
to talk to President-elect Ernesto Samper Pizano to define the 
Conservative Party's possible cooperation, if any, with the next 
government? 
  [Valencia] Obviously, as president of the National 
Directorate I have the authority to make these kinds of contacts 
and, I believe, they are very important for the country. We have 
a very positive attitude, and, of course, we are also very aware 
of the situation. However, we really want the country to be able 
to start on the road toward advancement and development, and, 
hopefully, we will do this as smoothly as possible. 
  [Reporter] In other words, you do not believe the Colombian 
Conservative Party should oppose the next government? 
  [Valencia] I believe this depends totally on the attitude 
assumed by the president. The president has to study what has 
happened in the country. Andres Pastrana is really a very 
important national leader. He managed to convince the entire 
Conservative Party to back his program and political platform, 
as well as independent and important sectors from the Liberal 
Party. I believe the president-elect of the Republic, who 
already has to think like a head of state, will study this new 
political situation, the breakdown in Congress, and all of the 
factors a president must consider to have a good government. 
  [Reporter] What is the mood within your party on the 
possibility of assuming the role of the new opposition? 
  [Valencia] I believe the Conservative Party really cares 
about Colombia's well-being and is willing to back the good 
things presented by the government, as well as being willing to 
criticize the bad things. At this time, however, as I have 
already stated, it is not up to the Conservative Party to decide 
whether or not it will participate in the government. This is a 
privilege of the president-elect. However, we have a positive 
attitude and the highest level of patriotic will, and, as I told 
you, we will back the good and criticize the bad. 
  [Reporter] Before I continue asking questions, we have to 
congratulate you for the extraordinary amount of Conservative 
votes--specifically, 471,834 votes--obtained in Antioquia. We 
also want to ask another question regarding the Conservative 
Party's immediate actions in Congress. What parliamentary 
actions will the Conservative Party emphasize? 
  [Valencia] First, thank you very much for your compliments 
on 
the votes received in Antioquia. We have a great team in the 
region. All of the Conservative Party members worked hard, and 
we also know a large number of independent liberals voted in our 
favor. [words indistinct] Antioquia has had experience in 
changes. We have been changing for the past five years. We 
started with the Constituent Assembly, and later we got Juan 
Gomez elected to the governor's post and Luis Alfredo Ramos to 
the mayor's post. That is why Andres Pastrana's victory in 
Antioquia was so overwhelming. 
  Regarding the work to be done in the legislature, we will be 
calling to a meeting of the Conservative Party bloc. As you 
know, we have 30 senators and more than 60 representatives. 
Therefore, we have a very important force in Congress. We are 
going to work to further the country's best interests. The party 
has made great advances under Andres Pastrana's leadership 
within the context of the supraparty movement, and we do not 
want to squander this great historic opportunity. 
  [Reporter] From Antioquia, Orlando Carames will ask the next 
question. 
  [Carames] Thank you. Dr. Valencia, gubernatorial and mayoral 
elections will be held in October. Based on the work done by the 
multipartisan United Antioquia Movement, Governor Juan Gomez and 
Medellin Mayor Luis Alfredo Ramos were elected in the previous 
election. Will this experiment be repeated, or will the party go 
it alone in the upcoming elections, now that it has an 
autonomous electoral force of more than 471,000 votes? 
  [Valencia] I believe the situation in Antioquia has to be 
studied. However, I repeat, I believe Antioquia voted with the 
supraparty movement because, as you stated, Orlando, the United 
Antioquia emerged precisely from the convergence of several 
political forces [words indistinct] liberal and independent 
sectors, and even from the M/19 [19 April Movement/Democratic 
Alliance]. This, I believe, gave us very good results. We all 
want serious, effective leaders who have good management skills. 
An example of such leaders are Juan Gomez Martinez and Luis 
Alfredo Ramos. We want the very best for Antioquia.

  [Text] Quito, 24 Jun (EFE) -- Quito newspapers published 
reports today that an Ecuadoran labor leader died on Thursday 
after being shot during a clash between soldiers and Aztra 
company employees, who staged a demonstration to protest the 
firm's privatization. The source added that two employees have 
disappeared, between two and five are wounded, and about 12 have 
been arrested. 
  Aztra sugar refinery union spokesmen say they are holding a 
Canar electoral tribunal employee hostage and intend to exchange 
him for the detained workers. The spokesmen say there are minors 
among the detained persons. 
  Walter Santos, 54 years old, was shot and killed on the 
fourth consecutive day of demonstrations by Aztra employees, who 
are demanding payment of delayed salaries and protesting the 
sale of the company, which is located approximately 400 km 
southwest of Quito. 
  The state-owned National Financial Corporation (CFN) on 
Wednesday transferred the company to a consortium of Ecuadoran 
and Colombian businessmen for $100,000, less than 2 percent of 
the firm's estimated value. 
  The workers were joined in their demonstrations by residents 
of La Troncal, a town near the Aztra facilities, who also 
confronted the soldiers. The soldiers are in the streets 
following Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran-Ballen's declaration 
of a state of emergency on Tuesday due to a conflict with the 
Indians. 
  The CFN sold 98 percent of the sugar refinery's shares for 
$100,000. The mill supplies 30 percent of the sugar consumed in 
Ecuador. 
  Up until March, each Aztra share sold for 750 sucres 
($0.40), 
but unexpectedly, according to stock market sources, they were 
auctioned on Wednesday for 8.55 sucres each, an act described by 
the workers as "illegal, immoral, and shameful." 
  Quito Stock Market Director Hector Terneus admitted that 
"such a broad fluctuation is not normal," but he denied the 
wrongdoing denounced by workers. 
  "The transaction was legal because it was in accordance with 
regulations governing the Ecuadoran stock market and stock 
exchange," Terneus said, although other reports assert that the 
state lost approximately $60 million. 
  Former CFN leader Guillermo Landazuri said the "symbolic" 
sale proves beyond a doubt "the dishonest manner in which Sixto 
Duran-Ballen's conservative administration has managed the 
privatization process" by "discrediting and damaging the image 
of state companies to lower their prices."

  [Text] The country will learn the Supreme Court 
Constitutional Chamber's ruling on the unconstitutionality of 
the agrarian law dictated by the Court of Constitutional 
Guarantees in approximately three weeks. Constitutional Chamber 
Magistrate Hugo Ordonez has asserted that they will expedite the 
ruling but that this does not mean it will be decided with undue 
haste. 
  [Begin Ordonez recording] I would not like to estimate the 
exact duration of this proceeding because it cannot be 
predetermined. We have to see if it takes the regular course. 
However, I surmise--and I do so only to answer the question you 
say currently concerns the country--that the matter could be 
resolved in approximately three weeks. [end recording] 
  Ordonez stated that the verdict will not depend on the 
magistrates' political leanings but instead on whether the law 
adheres to the Constitution.

  Maria Eugenia Lima, deputy for Chimborazo, said that the 52 
signatures needed to make the special congress official have not 
yet been obtained. 
  [Begin Lima recording] One serious problem is that [words 
indistinct], the required 52 signatures have not been obtained, 
even counting the opposition parties and the one that made the 
proposal. Anyway, the government has made several mistakes by 
sending us proposals that cause a social commotion and aggravate 
the country's problems. I think this mechanism itself guarantees 
that problems will not be solved. [end recording]

Congress' paralysis. Lima added that the people are eagerly 
awaiting 10 August, when Brettini will be replaced.

services. 
  The Bolivian foreign minister will arrive at 1430 today. 
Urupabol will serve as a Common Market of the South, Mercosur, 
bridge for Bolivia, which is an Andean Pact member. 
  The three countries' foreign ministers will meet at 1630 
today and will sign an agreement at noon on 25 June. 
  During the Uruguayan foreign minister's visit to our

Minister Crispiniano Sandoval said: "We need greater 
determination to combat tax evasion and smuggling. The Finance 
Ministry needs to earn the respect of society. We are collecting 
more but this is not enough. We have several commitments with 
the IMF that have yet to be accomplished." Lopez Silvero 
replaces Carlos Sosa Jovellanos, who resigned yesterday. 
  Several other replacements were announced through an 
executive branch decree. The most surprising one was that of 
Revenues Department Director Inocencio Davalos. He will be 
replaced by Castor Acosta. 
  Sandoval said the executive branch and the Finance Ministry 
are concerned about the Revenues Department performance compared 
to the progress by the Customs Directorate and the Collection 
Department (in charge of medium and small contributors).

<F P=106> ["Text" of the resignation letter sent by Interior Secretary </F>
Jorge Carpizo McGregor to President Carlos Salinas de Gortari; 
place and date not given; from the "Evening News Panorama" 
newscast -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] Mr. Carlos Salinas de Gortari, constitutional 
president of the United Mexican States. Distinguished President: 
  I expressed a number of concepts and ideas at the Federal 
Electoral Institute's regular meeting on 18 June, and I confirm 
them today. The people have a true saying that goes: He who gets 
angry, loses. I am more than angry; I am indignant and 
disappointed with my current position where I have done all I 
can possibly do. I have found people, however, from many 
sectors who, in the country's current situation, are only 
fighting for their own interests or those of their sector 
without caring for Mexico. On several occasions, I have urged 
society and the interior to base our actions exclusively on the 
truth. The response has been more lies, slander, and hypocrisy. 
  I promised to be impartial in my relations with all the 
political parties when I assumed this position. I am beginning 
not to be impartial with one of them because I am not and cannot 
ever agree with the actions of several sectors in that party. 
  One should recognize when it is time to leave. Due to my 
convictions and dignity, the time has come for me to do so. I 
no longer feel useful to the country in the political positions 
I accepted with the sole desire to serve Mexico. I am not a 
party man. I am really not a man of power. Thus, I will never 
again accept another political position. 
  For the aforementioned reasons, I respectfully request you 
accept my resignation from the post of interior secretary with 
which you honored me. I also want to thank you for your support 
and your trust in my work at the positions you assigned to me. 
I want to leave evidence that you never requested anything 
illegal from me while I occupied those positions. I also want 
to express my gratitude to my immediate assistants for their 
invaluable support during the past five years. 
  My norm, during the years I occupied political positions, 
was 
to strictly implement the law and to propose changes that would 
improve the law; my method was to have dialogue with reason. I 
fervently hope Mexican society and interior will reaffirm their 
adherence to the law and to truth. Mexico may be going through 
difficult moments, but, as in other occasions in its history, it 
will move ahead and will come out stronger. I take this 
opportunity to reiterate my respect. 
  [signed] Jorge Carpizo McGregor, interior secretary.

  [Text] Interior Secretary Jorge Carpizo McGregor has 
unexpectedly resigned from the post he assumed on 10 January. 
In a letter addressed to the president of the republic, Dr. 
Carpizo McGregor explained that his decision to resign was 
prompted by a political party's unrelenting attempts to tarnish 
the 21 August federal elections. 
  The Presidency of the republic reported that President 
Carlos 
Salinas asked Interior Secretary Carpizo McGregor to reconsider 
his resignation. They talked for several hours in President 
Salinas' office, but no agreement was reached. The president of 
Mexico said he hopes Dr. Carpizo reconsiders his decision, and 
Dr. Carpizo responded: "Give me some time, Mr. President. We 
will discuss this issue again this weekend." This is the 
current state of affairs. 
  There have been reactions from several officials following 
Carpizo's resignation. The National Executive Committee of the 
National Action Party [PAN] regretted Dr. Carpizo's decision and 
asked him to reconsider his decision. PAN Mexican presidential 
candidate Diego Fernandez de Zevallos echoed this request. 
  [Begin Fernandez de Zevallos recording] As a citizen and as 
PAN Mexican presidential candidate, I ask Dr. Carpizo McGregor 
to withdraw his resignation for the good of Mexico. I make this 
request considering my perception of Dr. Carpizo McGregor as an 
exemplary citizen and an honest official who must continue at 
the Interior Secretariat for Mexico's well-being. Thank you, 
that is all. [end recording] 
  PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution] presidential 
candidate Cuahutemoc Cardenas Solorzano also spoke about 
Carpizo's resignation. Cardenas is currently in Tuxtla 
Gutierrez, Chiapas State. He demanded that Jorge Carpizo 
McGregor explain his reasons for resigning from his post of 
interior secretary, which includes his post as president of the 
General Council of the Federal Electoral Institute.

  [Text] Mexico City, 24 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Today, President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari rejected the resignation of Interior 
Secretary Jorge Carpizo, who had sent a letter to the president 
stating his decision to resign and retire from political life. 
  The resignation presented by Carpizo, a prestigious attorney 
and former university director, took place two months before the 
21 August elections. Nine political parties have presented 
candidates for the country's presidential elections. Carpizo 
assumed the Interior Secretariat at the beginning of the year.

  [Text] Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, Mexican presidential 
candidate for the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI], has 
reacted to Interior Secretary Jorge Carpizo McGregor's letter of 
resignation. Zedillo reacted in a written statement issued 
through the National Executive Committee of his party. Zedillo 
noted that Carpizo's resignation from his post as interior 
secretary is not acceptable under any circumstance considering 
his political and moral attributes and his contribution to 
democracy, the protection of human rights, and the country's 
domestic policy of tolerance and concerted effort. There is an 
interesting paragraph in the Zedillo letter which reads: The PRI 
confirms its commitment to contributing to the efforts being 
made by Dr. Carpizo. The PRI supports Dr. Jorge Carpizo and 
cordially asks the government of the republic not to accept his 
resignation and to provide its fullest support for the work done 
by Dr. Carpizo. 
  The PRI also called on the Party of the Democratic 
Revolution 
[PRD] to immediately respond with conviction to the dialogue 
initiatives made by Carpizo in his roles as interior secretary 
and president of the General Council of the Federal Electoral 
Institute [IFE] to achieve the goals of the political forces and 
of all citizens. The PRI also asked the PRD and its supporters 
to respond to the proposals made by Dr. Carpizo at the sessions 
held at the General Council of the IFE on 18 June, in which he 
appealed for no more attitudes of confrontation. 
  It is also important to note that Ernesto Zedillo learned 
about Dr. Carpizo's letter in Toluca, Mexico State during a 
political event held with students at the technological 
institute, but the meeting was not very successful for Dr. 
Zedillo. 
  There was much emotion and joy, but that was because of the 
Mexican soccer team's victory. Dr. Zedillo said the following: 
  [Begin Zedillo recording] [Words indistinct] is for the 
national soccer team. [Students cheer] The rally has ended. Let 
us win on 21 August! [end recording] 
  When the political rally ended, Dr. Ernesto Zedillo said he 
would issue a statement on the resignation of the interior 
secretary at the PRI. He eventually did issue his statement 
through an information bulletin. At the rally, he said: Please 
let me learn more about the matter.

  [Text] Mexico City, 26 Jun (EFE) -- Today, Jorge Carpizo 
decided to stay on as interior secretary after resigning on 24 
June. Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari did not accept 
the resignation. 
  Carpizo, in a letter addressed to the president, said after 
receiving the support of broad segments of the community "and to 
prevent anyone from saying I acted irresponsibly and 
unpatriotically, I will remain in the post of interior 
secretary." 
  Carpizo's announcement averts a government crisis that many 
political analysts believe would have had serious consequences, 
if the resignation had occurred, on the political process Mexico 
is experiencing as it heads toward the 21 August presidential 
election,

  [Text] Mexico City, 26 Jun (DPA) -- Today, Jorge Carpizo, 
Mexican interior secretary and the country's highest electoral 
authority, withdrew the resignation he tendered on 24 June 
following controversies over the organization of the 21 August 
presidential and legislative elections. 
  The unexpected resignation of Minister Carpizo, who is also 
the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE) president and known for 
his honesty and impartiality, shook the Mexican political system 
by casting new doubts on the honesty, legality, and credibility 
of the Mexican electoral process. 
  In a letter sent to President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, 
Carpizo said he will remain in his post "to accomplish the 
duties inherent to the office during the upcoming federal 
elections" in light of the "solid support" expressed by large 
sectors of society; the president himself; political parties; 
and nongovernmental, professional, and educational organizations. 
  President Salinas expressed his "complete satisfaction" upon 
learning of Carpizo's decision to withdraw his resignation and 
said the support expressed for the interior minister by Mexican 
society "reflects the impressive resolve, which I share, to make 
democratic progress in accordance with the law and free of 
violence." 
  In his letter to Salinas, the minister and IFE president 
vowed to be impartial and added that he will continue to act "in 
strict accordance with the law and will hold honest, fair, 
objective, and unbiased elections." 
  The minister reiterated his decision not to occupy any other 
political post once his job as head of the Interior Ministry and 
the institute in charge of organizing the current elections ends. 
  Minister Carpizo had based his resignation on reports on the 
attitude of "certain sectors," which he accused of fighting only 
"for personal or group interests without caring for Mexico." 
That is why he said he was "more than angry, indignant, and 
disillusioned". 
  The official sharply disapproved of the attitude taken by a 
certain political party, whose name he refused to disclose, 
thereby sparking all kinds of speculation about whether he was 
alluding to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) 
or the opposing Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). 
  As he announced the withdrawal of his resignation, Carpizo 
again refused to specify which political party he had referred 
to because he believes it would "seriously impair" his 
impartiality and the role he must play in the electoral process. 
  PRD presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas accused 
President Salinas and PRI presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo 
of being responsible for Carpizo's resignation. Cardenas 
believes this situation reflects the existence of internal 
conflicts within the ruling party. 
  Meanwhile, Zedillo accused the PRD, without mentioning it by 
name, of being responsible for Carpizo's resignation. Zedillo 
blamed "the enemies of democracy," who "make fruitless attempts 
at subterfuge to incite a large electoral fraud in order to 
justify their anticipated defeat."

  [Text] Mexico City, 24 Jun (EFE) -- The appointment of the 
new commissioner for peace and reconciliation in the State of 
Chiapas confirms the government's determination to seek 
political solutions to the Indian conflict, PRI [Institutional 
Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo said 
today. 
  Last Wednesday, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari 
appointed Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, former president of the 
National Human Rights Commission, the new peace commissioner for 
Chiapas, replacing Manuel Camacho Solis, who resigned on 16 June. 
  Zedillo said Madrazo's appointment "confirms the 
government's 
determination that the dialogue, negotiations, and political 
solution must be the options to attain a definitive peace soon, 
one with justice." 
  The presidential candidate of the PRI, which has been in 
power since 1929, considered it an obligation to support the 
tasks of the government and the new commissioner for peace in 
the southeastern Mexican Chiapas State, in which the Zapatist 
National Liberation Army (EZLN) staged a rebellion on 1 January. 
  Zedillo's endorsement of the negotiations came after he 
strongly criticized Camacho Solis for the EZLN's refusal of the 
government offer, which the former commissioner presented as an 
official success, according to the PRI candidate. 
  Camacho Solis resigned because he considered Zedillo's 
criticism of his work a discredit. Zedillo had said his 
criticism reflected the feelings of numerous Mexican sectors.

<F P=106> [Report by Elio Henriquez and Jose Gil Olmos] </F>
  [Text] Cattle ranchers and small landowners in the armed 
conflict area have criticized the appointment of Jorge Madrazo 
Cuellar as the new peace and reconciliation commissioner in 
Chiapas. Jorge Constantino, leader of the Belisario Dominguez 
Regional Union of Rural Small Landowners, flatly said that 
"appointing one commissioner is a mistake. There should be 
several commissioners, not just one." 
  He added that his comrades hope Madrazo, "unlike Manuel 
Camacho Solis, who left his job incomplete, will work seriously 
to solve the problem once and for all. We are in no condition 
to keep waiting." 
  Speaking of Jorge Madrazo, Constantino said "he treated us 
badly as president of the National Human Rights Commission 
(CNDH) during some incidents in Altamirano Municipality. This, 
however, is not the time to chide him. We hope he will change 
his attitude." 
  Constantino's opposition to the appointment notwithstanding, 
he expressed his desire that "Madrazo will act impartially with 
justice on his side to expedite a solution to the conflict," 
emphasizing that "some of my associaites are disappointed by 
Madrazo's actions in Altamirano" earlier this year. 
  The cattle ranchers' leader said the attitude taken by 
Madrazo in those days could spark "negative reactions by cattle 
ranchers and landowners in the conflict area." 
  He emphasized the following: We hope the Zapatist National 
Liberation Army [EZLN] accepts the new commissioner appointed by 
President Carlos Salinas, because "if he is the cure for what 
ails us, go ahead. We do not care who solves it." 
  The leader criticized former Commissioner Manuel Camacho's 
work by saying: "I do not know what positive role he played 
because the EZLN refused to accept the government's proposals. 
Constantino insisted that Camacho's job was left incomplete. 
  Francisco Lopez Ardinez, leader of the Ocosingo Cattle 
Ranchers Association, said his comrades were "not too pleased 
with the appointment." The leader of cattle ranchers in 
Ocosingo, one of the municipalities most affected by the armed 
conflict, angrily and disapprovingly added: "I would rather say 
nothing because the best opinion is the one that remains 
unspoken, the one that is interpreted only."

<F P=106> [Third of three installments of an interview with </F>
Subcommander Marcos of the Zapatist National Liberation Army, 
EZLN, by correspondent Epigmenio Ibarra in the Lacandona jungle 
in June; date not given; first three paragraphs are LA JORNADA 
introduction; quotation marks as published] 
  [Text] According to Subcommander Marcos, the National 
Democratic Convention convened by the EZLN is the proper 
alternative to prevent what is regarded as an imminent outbreak 
of violence. It is the responsibility of all political forces 
to choose that alternative, Marcos points out. "If the 
political parties take the wrong stand on the convention, they 
will eventually take the wrong stand on the war, which will blow 
up in their faces again sooner or later," he insists. He 
continues to say that the convention, for the time being, 
"offers the only opportunity to unite a scattered civilian 
movement with an isolated but localized military movement," thus 
forcing "a peaceful transition or at least making the military 
phaseout less bloody." 
  "Why should someone who demands freedom, justice, and 
democracy be labeled a dreamer," he wonders. He says that the 
convention, "this crossroads, this point of convergence with 
civilian society, organized or disorganized, is the first item 
on the EZLN agenda." 
  In this third installment of an interview held in the 
Lacandona Jungle, Marcos reaffirms the need for the union of 
"civilian and military revolutionaries." Asked if he still has 
hopes, Marcos answers: "Under the circumstances, that is the 
only thing that can keep us on our feet and alive. The problem 
now is to find out whether this hope has a trigger or a ballot." 
  [Ibarra] Any hope of holding the convention? 
  [Marcos] It would be premature to say. For the time being, 
we feel the convention offers the only opportunity to unite a 
scattered civilian movement with an isolated or localized 
military movement. We believe that the convention, inasmuch as 
it represents the convergence of military and civilian efforts 
toward the same purpose, can still bring about a peaceful 
transition or at least make the military phaseout less violent. 
  [Ibarra] There is an electoral process under way. Political 
forces are challenging each other. For instance, why can the 
PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution] not say: I am betting 
on the convention, not the elections, or the PAN [National 
Action Party]? What would happen if those organized political 
forces did not cooperate? 
  [Marcos] The political parties must start from reality. The 
media have pointed out that none of the parties has succeeded in 
achieving a consensus among those who abstain. That is to say, 
the parties are facing a very high degree of abstentionism and 
will share the votes. According to the official list, there are 
between 45 and 50 million registered voters, but everyone is 
taking it for granted that at least half of them will not vote. 
In other words, the parties will have to share between 22 and 
25 million votes. According to the most optimistic estimates, 
the winning candidate will receive between 9 and 12 million 
votes. The winner will have to govern in an ungovernable 
climate. In other words, the winner will receive between 15 and 
20 percent of the vote at most. Whether he likes it or not, his 
government will be a minority. If I were the winning 
candidate, I would be seriously concerned about that 50 percent, 
the more than 20 million people who will not vote because they 
are not interested in politics or elections or because they 
believe in violence. I would not say they would necessarily 
take up arms, but they would look favorably on an armed 
movement, one that could break up the electoral system. 
  The political parties are aiming in the wrong direction, at 
those who are determined to vote and will vote. We aim at those 
who will not. If the political parties take the wrong stand 
regarding the convention, they will eventually take the wrong 
stand on the war, which will blow up in their faces again sooner 
or later. That 50 percent of registered voters who will not 
vote represents the potential for war. That is how we see it. 
  [Ibarra] Does this have the potential for passivity and 
conformism? 
  [Marcos] Our analysis is based on this group. Passivity and 
conformism are a force that will go in one way or another. It 
could be the balance will tilt in one direction and things will 
remain the same, but the balance could also tilt toward war if 
the group, in one way or another, decides: "Well, let there be a 
war. We will not do anything to stop it." Isolated groups or, 
as they are called, groups of lunatics could start mobilizing 
and encouraging the other millions of Mexicans in that 50 
percent to move to a more radical and permanent option. 
  [Ibarra] Mexico had a convention in the past, the 
Aguascalientes Convention. Are you urging a convention as part 
of a revolutionary tradition, or do you believe you can carry 
out a task similar to the one undertaken at the Aguascalientes 
Convention in the past? 
  [Marcos] We believe we can keep the task that was not 
accomplished at the Aguascalientes Convention. Of course, it is 
also part of the EZLN's historic right to call to this 
convention. I want to tell you, I really want to insist to the 
country that we are not resorting to foreign models to make our 
demands or to further our political and military course. The 
1914 Aguascalientes Convention was an effort to unite the 
military and civilian movements of those times. The Zapatists 
understood it in this manner, but they were defeated on this 
issue at this convention. The 1914 Convention was an agreement, 
or, rather, was an attempt to reach an agreement to get the 
military forces to become civilian-oriented. The Zapatists of 
those times insisted that it had to be an agreement between the 
military forces and the civilians to further this transition, 
but the revolutionary civilians and military forces did not 
reach an agreement for several reasons. The objective of the 
1994 Convention, to which we are calling, is to try to associate 
or to hold a meeting between revolutionary civilians and 
revolutionary military forces to initiate this passage to 
democracy in Mexico. 
  [Ibarra] Other attempts are being made. The peace 
commissioner himself was working hard to further an initiative 
for a government of transition or a wide front for democracy. 
What do you think of those efforts? 
  [Marcos] We view those efforts with skepticism because other 
people's logic will say what is to be done, as they are the ones 
who will make the summons a success. The government always says 
it is successful in the measure that it appears in media 
headlines. Political parties and other forces believe they are 
advancing based on the amount of intellectuals in their groups 
or the space the media gives them. This is how they appraise 
the situation, but, later on, reality shows them they were 
wrong. We are calling those who do not have space in the 
newspapers, those who do not want to give conferences or write 
in newspapers, those who are voiceless and faceless, as we have 
said previously. We are calling them to this convention or to 
reach this agreement between civilians and military forces. 
  "We do not reject this type of initiatives or fronts, but, 
in 
one way or another, if they are perceptive and honest, they will 
have to converge and agree with the convention for which we are 
calling or at least to reach an agreement regarding it." 
  [Ibarra] It is frequently said the isolation, the jungle, 
the 
years of struggle here can inhibit you from having a coherent, 
cohesive vision of the future to design a project for the 
country that can be offered to all of Mexico. 
  [Marcos] Regarding our historic blindness, I believe the 
events between January and July have shown that if we do not 
have much lucidity, there are others who are at least blinder 
than we are. This is the EZLN's modest, or, better said, we 
admit that the reality is: There is no project for the future of 
the country. We are saying: Let us sit down and talk with those 
who are going to have to carry out, to deal with, to confront or 
organize the country's future. We have to sit down and talk 
about it, and the place is at the convention. We have to reach 
an agreement, to discuss what it is we want, and, in that sense, 
the EZLN's voice will be one among the others. What worries us 
greatly is: Why do they say a person is a utopian if he asks 
for freedom, justice, and democracy? To what point have we 
gotten in this country that we say a person who is fighting for 
the most basic human rights is a utopian? To what point has 
skepticism contaminated, poisoned people already? 
  [Ibarra] Are you referring to the skepticism? 
  [Marcos] Look, how can an army take up arms for freedom, 
justice, and democracy and this be considered as utopian. We 
want a democratic, free, and just country, and this is utopian? 
What has happened to the people who think and write? What are 
they doing with their thoughts, their work, their life? In what 
way or up to what point has skepticism poisoned them? Is it to 
the point that they say nothing is possible? In what measure is 
this conformism or passivity? 
  "What we are trying to do is open a space so that, perhaps, 
all the skepticism in the country will not necessarily become 
skepticism to the nth power and to have the possibility of 
realizing it is not a utopia but, rather, a right for which we 
have to fight. In the worst case, all the revolutions have been 
a utopia prior to being started, and all major changes in the 
history of mankind have been a utopia the day before they became 
a reality. 
  [Ibarra] What is the first point on the EZLN program at 
this time? 
  [Marcos] The convention. All our efforts will now be focused 
on establishing that bridge, that link of unity, that point of 
consensus with civilian society, organized or unorganized. The 
convention, if it materializes, is the only possibility for the 
EZLN and the country to make a peaceful journey to democracy, 
without violence. 
  [Ibarra] Weapons today are a guarantee of this peaceful 
journey. Does the EZLN's existence change the outlook? 
  [Marcos] Yes, there is another option now. The option 
before was: You either settle for what I offer or you will face 
my weapons, that is, their weapons. We are now saying: You 
either agree with the decision of a majority or settle for a 
very long war that would wear down both parties, and we are the 
only ones who have nothing to lose. We made no investments in 
the stock market, and we have nothing to lose in this regard. 
Those who have investments, prestige, and so on, need to be 
careful; we do not. They either accept this decision imposed 
through a peaceful means or accept that hell will last several 
years. 
  [Ibarra] When we refer to hell and the possibility of the 
explosion of a conflict, many talk about 22 August as the day 
when this could happen. There could, however, also be some sort 
of propaganda to frighten the people. 
  [Marcos] I think that January, well, actually the six months 
of war, or armed truce, or armed peace, as some call it, 
demonstrated once again the limits of the media, the limits of 
propaganda. What started in January or February, I mean the 
possibility of a new ethical code or a new way to handle the 
media, finally resumed its course. Efforts that certain media 
were making to democratize themselves to genuinely meet the 
expectations started to disappear. There was an attempt to be 
the protagonist; they were certain about their influence on 
public opinion until we proved them wrong on 10 June 1994, when 
we said no. 
  "Throughout that period, everyone insisted in the media that 
the armed struggle was no option. I am glad that peace is on 
the way, that there was already a negotiation, that it is only a 
matter of time, and that there will be a spectacular signing. I 
insist that faceless and nameless armed forces, which respond to 
the EZLN, have grown throughout the country and in certain 
sectors. If they are betting on propaganda, they are betting to 
lose; if they are betting on television spots and newspaper 
headlines, by the way, they will lose, and so will the media." 
  [Ibarra] Finally, you are talking to an atomized left wing. 
You told them: Let us reach a consensus on what we do not want, 
and later we will reach a consensus on what we want. Is this 
possible? What project are you proposing to the left wing, and 
what will be your stand toward the elections, which are just 
round the corner? What will the EZLN do with its political and 
moral strength? Who will receive it? Where will it channel it? 
  [Marcos] We do not know; this is quite a problem. We think 
that historic time is going by faster than calendar time; the 
historic time between 1 January and 10 June, when we said no to 
the government proposals, that is, between the first and the 
second Lacandona Jungle declarations. In terms of historic 
time, it was very meaningful to this country. This means that 
it is possible to make historic time run faster than calendar 
time and that this process to achieve unity and agree on what we 
do not want -- that we no longer want a state party -- includes 
not only an atomized left wing, but that it could also lead the 
middle class and important wealthy sectors. 
  "In one way or another, the clumsiness of the state party, 
as 
it promoted a neoliberal and arbitrary project at the political 
level, also affected the interests of the high classes. I think 
that the stand of saying no to the state party will find 
supporters in broad sectors of the population. The problem 
arises when we say: We want to be Maoists, Trotskyists, 
orthodox, social Christians, democrats, centrists, and so on; 
that is where problems start. When a person starts to say how 
things should be, he starts, even unwillingly and spontaneously, 
to divide and dissolve. 
  "But if we try to reach a consensus on what we do not want, 
we believe we can participate. We may not be the leaders, but 
we can participate in a broader movement under the common cause 
of opposing the official party. We have had enough of the 
official party and everything it implies. This historic time is 
about to whom we should give our political support. We believe 
many forces will establish their positions in the coming days, 
even regarding the convention. Whom could we support, whom 
could be the man to receive our support, or does a transition to 
democracy have a name? I am telling you: We do not know any of 
this yet. We would have to know if a leader such as Francisco 
I. Madero will come forth in this historic time, given we are 
referring to the historic past that nourishes the EZLN. 
  Finally, the EZLN is foreseeing that even if a leader is 
missing, at least there will be, at the social and civic levels, 
the need for a transition government and a new Constitution, 
which regulates the new political relations. It would be good to 
have a leader at the right time and the right moment. We cannot 
commit our political endorsement, our support to someone unless 
the historic moment indicates he is worthy of it. By historic 
time, we mean the mobilizations and the explicit commitment to 
assume the EZLN causes; otherwise, we could implicitly 
acknowledge that or we could, in a given moment, raise those 
causes. The EZLN believes a government must have a clear 
commitment to advance the causes for which we rose up in arms. 
Our causes are outlined in 11 points, which are mainly 
encompassed in democracy, freedom, and justice. 
  [Ibarra] The EZLN would somehow be a force depending on 
historic forces. It would be a catalyst, a thermometer. 
  [Marcos] We believe that does not mean there is a fever. The 
EZLN is conducting an internal evaluation and is obtaining a 
"negative" result. It is conducting an external evaluation at 
two levels through the tables set up for consultations and 
informal consultations, and the result is also "negative." We 
believe this is right, that the measure was the correct one, and 
that we must assess the situation again. We must again set the 
thermometer for August, that is, from now until to August -- 
what will happen between now until August -- and examine whether 
a peaceful transition is still possible. We are optimistic and 
believe a peaceful transition is still possible. What concerns 
us is whether a leader will come forth. 
  [Ibarra] The responsibility is no longer in your hands but 
in 
the hands of people in the cities and towns, people outside the 
EZLN. 
  [Marcos] Definitely, because I must clarify that even in 
military terms, we are not at a military disadvantage vis-a-vis 
our situation in January. In other words, we are not weaker 
militarily than in January, nor have we more to lose now than we 
did then. On the contrary, in military terms, we have more 
advantages: Our morale is higher now than in January; we have 
more people now than then, and we have nothing to lose by 
waiting and saying if you have another alternative try it. We 
cannot do any worse than we did. In any event, whatever happens 
will be better for us as an organization, as the EZLN. 
  "Time flies for the civilian sector; historic time flies. I 
insist on that, because I always get answers based on a 
calendar. I tell the government that if they would have thought 
on 1 January of stopping the war in 12 days, they themselves 
would have said it was not enough days, but I believe that had 
they organized themselves, it would have been enough time. Now, 
there is much effervescence, which could generate results at the 
Convention." 
  [Ibarra] Do you have any hope? 
  [Marcos] Yes, definitely. Hope is the only thing that under 
the current circumstances can still keep us alive and on our 
feet. The problem now is determining whether that hope has a 
trigger or a ballot.

<F P=106> [Report by Nestor Martinez] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday, in a unanimous vote, the Senate 
authorized the executive branch to acquire up to $4.279 million 
in International Financial Corporation [IFC] shares. The 
purchase will be made through the Bank of Mexico, bringing the 
country's total shares to a maximum of 27,589. The IFC is a 
division of the World Bank. 
  The Senate also approved the second issuance of the new, 
silver 5-peso coin commemorating the quincentennial of the 
discovery of America. The issuance was reportedly authorized as 
an incentive for national producers and as a means for the 
executive branch to help strengthen the mining industry, which 
is currently experiencing a serious crisis. 
  Porfirio Munoz Ledo, president of the Party of the 
Democratic 
Revolution, made a short statement to say the transaction with 
the IFC was "positive" as it calls for an additional 
disbursement of more than $4 million, which will strengthen the 
Bank of Mexico and increase the country's participation. 
  Munoz highlighted the fact that the loans were to come from 
international financial organizations. Mexico urgently needs 
assistance to reconstruct its productive economy, increase 
employment, and funnel all possible funds, especially those 
coming from multilateral loans, toward developing small and 
medium enterprises, decentralizing the economy, and increasing 
production. 
  Jesus Rodriguez y Rodriguez, president of the Senate 
Treasury 
Commission, said "the transaction is, of course, advantageous. 
He added that "our dealings with that organization have been 
beneficial as we have received $100 in loans for every $1 
invested." He said such loans have been granted on excellent 
terms and under superb time conditions.

  [Text] Mexico City, 23 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Today, the 
government announced the expulsion of Belgian citizen Frederik 
Vandersteene for participating in Mexican political activities, 
thus violating national laws. 
  The Immigration Services Sub-Secretariat of the Interior 
Secretariat reported that the expulsion took place 16 days ago 
after authorities demonstrated that Vandersteene participated in 
political activities in Chiapas State, southeastern Mexico. 
  The sub-secretariat added that the Belgian citizen admitted 
to active participation in Mexican internal political affairs, 
thus violating the law, and recognized that "as a foreigner, I 
am forbidden from participating in the country's political 
affairs. 
  The Immigration Sub-Secretariat issued a communique 
explaining that Vandersteene was in possession of a tactical 
maneuvers manual which included instructions on how to act 
before authorities to go undetected in case of an armed attack. 
  Vandersteene arrived in the country on 15 March 1993 as a 
one-year visitor to work for the Suitable Technology for 
Agricultural Development and Services Civic Association. On 1 
June, he asked immigration authorities in San Cristobal de las 
Casas, southeastern Chiapas State, for a permit to leave the 
country permanently because he lacked immigration documents and 
because it suited his plans. 
  The communique states that the permit was granted on 7 June, 
but then Vandersteene said he wanted to visit Cancun, in eastern 
Quintana Roo State, despite his request to leave the country 
permanently. 
  When asked to show the documents granting him permanent 
residence in the country, Vandersteene, who had a round-trip 
Cancun-Amsterdam-Cancun ticket, showed a briefcase full of 
papers detailing his political activities in Mexico. 
  The sub-secretariat said that the tactical maneuvers manual 
and the papers demonstrating that he was in Chiapas carrying out 
political activities forbidden to foreigners were among the 
documents inside his briefcase. The Belgian citizen said the 
manual was "a souvenir" he wanted to take to Belgium and 
admitted he participated in internal political affairs. 
  In view of these circumstances, the Immigration 
Sub-Secretariat turned Vandersteene over to the Quintana Roo 
Attorney General's Office. The local court ruled there was 
insufficient evidence to presume he had committed any crime. 
The communique goes on to explain that immigration authorities 
then proceeded to expel the Belgian citizen on 7 June.

  [Text] Mexico City, 25 Jun (EFE) -- A group of alleged 
members of the Basque terrorist organization ETA [Basque 
Fatherland and Liberty] was arrested in the city of Zapopan, 
Jalisco State, western Mexico, and is accused of being involved 
in homicides, kidnappings, and bank robberies, according to the 
Mexican newspaper EL UNIVERSAL GRAFICO. The newspaper reported 
the group, presumably linked to the terrorist organization ETA, 
was arrested following an extortion attempt in Zapopan. 
  EL UNIVERSAL GRAFICO cites investigations which the Attorney 
General's Office (PGR) has conducted and adds the group under 
arrest is involved in the deaths of a citizen from Los Angeles, 
(California), a Venezuelan official, and a Mexican businessman. 
  The group, known as "Los Julupesty," has been committing 
"kidnappings, homicides, threats, and thefts in various banking 
institutions" in the last few months, the Mexican newspaper has 
reported. The arrested men followed "a crime route extending 
from Los Angeles, California, to Caracas, Venezuela, passing 
through Mexico," the publication reports. 
  The group is headed by David Gomez, alias "El Chino," a 
fugitive of the justice system and an alleged, active, ETA 
member, the article added. The arrested individuals, whose 
nationalities were not disclosed, are Marcos Gomez Ontiveros, 
Ernesto Lopez, Carlos Alberto Ortiz, Daniel Ramirez, Vilma 
Ramirez, Carmen Armianca, and Jarry Gomez. 
  In their first statements before the Jalisco Attorney 
General's Office, the seven individuals admitted they had tried 
to extort a family in Zapopan through a letter, but the family 
notified the police, the Mexican newspaper reported. 
The article added the arrested individuals could be involved in 
the murder of businessman Mario Gonzalez, who was shot to death 
by two individuals in the Mexican port of Veracruz on 1 April. 
  Likewise, according to the source, they are accused of 
participating in the kidnapping and murder of William Munoz, 
leader of a gypsy community in Los Angeles who was killed on 21 
April because the $1-million ransom that was being demanded was 
not paid.

  [Text] Suriname and Guyana are working on strengthening 
their relations and increasing cooperation among them. 
Suriname's admittance to Caricom [Caribbean Common Market] next 
month is expected to create possibilities to make these 
intentions come true. So says the Surinamese president. 
Meanwhile Guyana's president, Cheddi Jagan, has assured his 
Dutch counterpart of his country's support for Suriname's 
request for Caricom membership. President Jagan arrived in 
Suriname on Monday [20 June] for a four-day official visit. 
Marion Riedewald reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Riedewald] President Ronald Venetiaan 
says 
the border dispute between Suriname and Guyana should be solved 
in order to promote collaboration between the two countries. 
Guyana, 25 years ago, occupied the piece of land which she 
claims to be hers. The countries are disputing about where the 
source of the bordering Corantijn River is. The problem 
originates from the time when Suriname was a colony of the 
Netherlands and Guyana a colony of England. Holland and England 
then agreed that the Corantijn River would be the border to 
Suriname and Guyana, taking the uppper Corantijn as the source 
of the Corantijn. Now President Ronald Venetiaan suggests 
international mediation to solve this problem. However, the 
border dispute should not stand in the way of positive 
collaboration between the two nations, say the Surinamese 
president. 
  During a special address to the National Assembly on Tuesday 
[21 June], Guyana's president, Cheddi Jagan, said the Corantijn 
River should not be dividing, but uniting the two countries. He 
suggested that the parliaments of Suriname and Guyana make laws 
that enable mutual private investments in the two countries. 
  [Jagan] Clearly we cannot be satisfied merely with the 
establishment of democratic institutions. Our democratic 
institutions, including our parliaments, must function in a 
manner that puts the welfare of our people at the central point 
of our purpose. 
  [Riedewald] Bilateral collaboration is not enough says 
Jagan. 
Suriname and Guyana should also work together within regional 
organizations. 
  During his four-day visit to Suriname, President Jagan 
visited the state oil company, the banana company, and 
(Effebacher) power plants and other production facilities in 
Suriname. [end recording]

  [Text] Caracas, 25 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- On 1 July, President 
Rafael Caldera will unveil in Caracas new economic measures with 
which he seeks to overcome the country's economic and financial 
crisis, an official source said today. Pompeyo Marquez, special 
minister and presidential adviser, said in Maracay, an 
industrial city 80 km west of Caracas, that the plan will focus 
in particular on social programs and reactivating production. 
  To that effect, Marquez said the measures will cover three 
major areas: stockpiles--to prevent hoarding; employment; and 
training. The measures are intended to raise Venezuelans' 
standard of living, although most problems will not be totally 
resolved, Marquez noted. 
  Venezuelans are anxious following the collapse of seven 
banks 
and last week's 8.65 percent devaluation of the bolivar to the 
level of 210 bolivares to the dollar. Local economists have said 
that Caldera is leaning toward exchange rate controls, a measure 
the economy minister opposes. Marquez said he supports controls 
on prices and imports because those measures will stamp out 
speculation and capital flight.

<F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Finance Minister Julio Sosa has not discounted the 
possibility of placing controls on foreign exchange. Sosa said 
he does not favor controls, but the government is prepared to 
adopt any necessary measures. The minister made these statements 
during a news conference he held after being questioned by the 
Chamber of Deputies. 
  [Begin Sosa recording] Such matters are being reviewed by 
the 
president at cabinet meetings. What I said was that when this 
kind of measure becomes necessary, it must be considered. What 
is happening, however, is that we are hoping that this will not 
become necessary. [end recording] 
  The questioning took place as planned; that is, there were 
four rounds of questions. A total of 24 congressmen took the 
floor. At the session, Minister Sosa reviewed important aspects 
of the current economic and financial situation in the country. 
He said the government does not favor nationalizing the banks, 
but it has not ruled out the possibility. Referring to the eight 
financial institutions in which the government has intervened, 
the minister said that intervention boards have 30 days to 
decide whether these banks should be liquidated or restructured. 
He also spoke about privatization processes, noting that they 
are necessary to keep the state from suffering huge losses. 
  He said he does not favor the privatizing of Venezuelan 
Petroleum or the Venezuelan Corporation of Guayana. 
  He also discussed the disparity between assets and 
liabilities. He noted that the Central Bank of Venezuela must 
find a way to trim the shortfalls. The minister said 
nonrestructured foreign debt has risen to 250 billion bolivares, 
adding that this has produced domestic outlays of approximately 
150 billion bolivares. 
  After the session, "Union Radio News" consulted the various 
parliamentary factions to learn what their position would be on 
a censure vote. The social Christian Party and Democratic Action 
were cautious in their responses. They said they will wait until 
President Rafael Caldera speaks about this vote. Radical Cause, 
however, is maintaining its position in favor of a censure vote.

  [Text] BCV [Central Bank of Venezuela] President Antonio 
Casas Gonzalez asserted last night that the government will 
avoid controlling foreign exchanges "as much as possible" and 
will maintain the current currency distribution mechanism. 
  We are monitoring the market closely because we want to 
avoid 
controlling foreign exchanges as much as possible, the BCV 
president said at the Miraflores Palace. 
  Casas Gonzalez presided over a special BCV directorate 
meeting last night. He later went to the Miraflores Palace and 
met with President Rafael Caldera and Finance Minister Julio 
Sosa Rodriguez for almost two hours. 
  We are following the same foreign exchange system we have 
used in the past. It is difficult to combat speculation in a 
situation of distrust such as the current situation. There are 
rumors about situations that do not exist and there is 
apprehension that the price of the dollar will rise. However, 
the mechanism has worked and we believe it will continue to 
work. We are constantly observing the market. You must have 
noticed that today, the bolivar to dollar exchange rate reached 
almost 200 bolivares to the dollar but it later dropped to 192 
bolivares to the dollar. Thus, the mechanism is working, Casas 
Gonzalez stated. 
  However, he warned that the situation could get difficult if 
the campaign of rumors to discredit the banks, the issues 
regarding Congress, the votes of censure, and things of this 
type continue. Such actions create distrust and the system 
cannot operate without trust, Casas Gonzalez added. 
  [Reporter] Could an economic emergency be declared? 
  [Casas] No, I don't think so. 
  [Reporter] Do the BCV and the government agree on the 
monetary policy? The government stated that it is not 
responsible for those decisions. 
  [Casas] It is our responsibility, but we have agreed up to 
now.

  [Text] Caracas, 24 Jun (EFE) -- The serious economic, 
political, and social situation in Venezuela has triggered new 
waves of protests in several cities in the country during the 
past few days. 
  The riots in Bejuma, Miranda, and Montalban, Carabobo State, 
211 km from Caracas, resulted in three injuries, a fire at a 
commercial warehouse, and several attempts to loot shops. 
Citizens clashed with police during the "Day For Hunger" 
[Jornada por el Hambre] held on Wednesday. The event, which was 
to protest the high cost of living, was organized by the 
Federation of Consumer Associations in Montalban. 
  The main cause of the people's unrest is price speculation 
on 
staple goods and store hoarding. As a result of the protests 
over the last few days, the Chamber of Deputies approved an 
agreement that calls upon the people and the government to join 
efforts to find effective solutions to the deterioration in 
family budgets and to control speculation. 
  The speculative wave has prompted the government to look for 
agreements with merchants on consumer prices. Several 
parliamentarians, however, have demanded that the Executive 
Branch implement a "war economy" to control prices directly. 
  Lorenzo Tovar, the president of the Consumer Defense and 
Education Institute (IDEC) said that excessive and uncontrolled 
price increases in several stores is a crime. Tovar recommended 
that the government find a solution to price speculation in the 
country because it has turned into a state problem.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Rafael Caldera on the occasion of Army </F>
Day from Paseo Carabobo in Caracas -- live] 
  [Text] The country's present situation dictates that I add 
a few words to the congratulatory message I sent today, on 
occasion of the anniversary of the immortal battle of Carabobo, 
to the Army commander, officers, junior officers, military 
academy cadets, enlisted troops, and civilian personnel working 
for the glorious Venezuelan Armed Forces, which today 
commemorates its special day. Under these circumstances, I must 
say that I am determined to halt all morbid and criminal 
attempts to ruin our national currency, which bears the 
magnificent name of Bolivar, as well as all attempts to deplete 
our operational reserves. The national government is determined 
to adopt all necessary measures and quite clearly states that 
whatever situation the country may face, we have the resources 
required to meet our international obligations and to satisfy 
the country's most basic needs. 
  The current situation has circumstantial causes, among which 
we can mention the distrust that has arisen as a result of 
despicable rumors that have been intentionally disseminated and 
the speculators who have no qualms about resorting to any 
measure for personal gain. We are facing difficult times, but 
the country understands this and knows that we will overcome it 
with the support of all Venezuelans. 
  The fall of our currency has reactivated inflationary 
pressure that we had practically controlled by limiting the 
fiscal deficit. If it is true that inflationary pressure is 
reflected over the price of goods, it is also true that 
speculation has lead consumers to purchase more goods over and 
above any inflationary pressure. The national government is 
determined to utilize any means possible to alleviate the 
situation of lower income groups my making basic goods 
accessible and by improving the wages of all public and private 
sector workers. In that respect, we call for everyone's 
understanding and support. 
  I warn those who are determined to foment disturbances that 
the people repudiate the violence they are promoting. A majority 
of the population knows that violence solves nothing and only 
leads to more violence. Those inciters of violence must keep in 
mind that even if they can obtain the temporary support of some 
small groups, they will never ensure the total support of a 
majority of the population. The national government, with the 
absolute and determined backing of the National Armed Forces, is 
prepared to repress violence with all the moderation it can 
muster, but also with the necessary energy. It is our duty to 
solve the country's predicament under these circumstances, and 
we are going to do it. Today, at this time and at this place, 
which reminds us of the battle of Carabobo, I would like to 
reaffirm my solemn duty to the Venezuelan people. The Republic 
will not be lost in my hands. [applause]

  [Text] Lima 24 Jun (EFE) -- Today, Peruvian President 
Alberto Fujimori called U.S. President Bill Clinton's proposal 
to Congress that U.S. support to Peru for the detection of drug 
trafficking from the air be reestablished positive. Fujimori 
said, however, that "with or without support," Peru is carrying 
out a firm and constant struggle against drug trafficking. 
  He recalled that the contribution made by the U.S. AWACS and 
Orion airplanes with modern equipment for detecting airplanes 
had been very effective when they were cooperating with the 
Peruvian Air Force, until May when the U.S. Government decided 
to withdraw that support. 
  In a news conference, Fujimori said that with that help, 
"our 
airplanes were able to persecute and shoot down" the airplanes 
of Colombian drug traffickers entering the Peruvian jungle 
region to pick up the basic cocaine paste gathered by drug 
traffickers. Fujimori added that the U.S. radar installed in 
the jungle region, which was also deactivated, was not effective 
as it is obsolete equipment used during World War II. 
  He said that the reestablishment of the aid for detecting 
the 
airplanes of drug traffickers would be a positive step. He 
reiterated that the struggle against drug trafficking is an 
international problem, which is the responsibility of drug 
producing and consuming countries.

  [Excerpt] Lima, 24 Jun (EFE) -- A law establishing prison 
sentences of eight to 15 years for people who grow 
heroin-producing poppies went into effect in Peru today. 
  The law was approved by Congress on 22 June. It confirms the 
sentences included in the original bill. 
  The Peruvian penal code now includes the "crime of growing, 
promoting, assisting, or financing" the planting of poppy 
plantations used for making opium or heroin. [passage omitted]

    [Editorial Report] Lima LA REPUBLICA in Spanish on 10 June 
94, pages 19 through 21, carries a 1,800-word report by 
Francisco Mattos who says that sources close to Peruvian unions 
have reported that in the next few days they will raise further 
charges of labor rights violations by the Peruvian Government 
before the International Labor Organization, ILO. The article 
states that these charges will be added to the 16 charges that 
labor unions submitted to the Peruvian Government last year. 
  The report quotes Teodulo Hernandez Valle, secretary general 
of the General Confederation of Peruvian Workers, CGTP, as 
saying: "It is the policy of this administration to ignore our 
rights instead of respecting us as a labor force. This is the 
reason behind our complaints, which will be submitted not only 
by Peruvian unions but by foreign unions as well." 
  The article states that in the last few hours, Labor 
Minister 
Augusto Antonioli and two close advisers left for Geneva where 
this coming weekend Antonioli will try to justify the Peruvian 
Government position regarding the charges. It states, however, 
that like last May, he will fail because of the Peruvian 
Government's refusal to make its labor policy more flexible. 
  The report says labor leader Juan Luna Rojas, from the CGTP, 
will be the main union delegate attending the ILO conference. It 
has yet to be confirmed if Hernandez Valle will attend the ILO 
conference because, unlike on previous occasions, the government 
has refused to cover the expenses of the trip. Hernandez Valle 
adds: "This is only one of many examples of the government's 
true intention, that is, to crush the rights the workers have 
achieved through struggle." 
  After stating that several unions have tried to obtain the 
necessary funds to finance his trip, Hernandez Valle adds: "In 
view of this, we have decided to sponsor a national strike on 21 
July. Either the government improves its labor policy or the 
labor movement will adopt more radical measures." 
  The article quotes CGTP as saying that Hernandez Valle will 
travel to Geneva to support Luna Rojas's case and exercise the 
right of rebuttal. If he is unable to attend, Luna Rojas will 
explain the position of all Peruvian labor unions. Hernandez 
Valle says: "This time around, it will not be a single voice but 
the voice of all Peruvian unions." He adds: "If this government 
abuses the workers, where can we go for help? We will simply 
resort to all those who may help us change the attitude of 
dictatorship towards labor." 
  The article states that labor expert Mario Pasco Cosmopolis 
believes the ILO is not the proper forum to discuss 
disagreements between the government and labor because it is not 
empowered to impose sanctions, it can only make recommendations. 
  The article adds that Mario Pasco does not believe the U.S. 
House of Representatives will exclude Peru from its preferential 
tariff list in view of the labor violation charges raised last 
year before the AFL-CIO. Pasco then explains that before making 
this decision, "the U.S. Trade Department must prove any 
violations." He adds that these charges were submitted before 
the ILO, which falls under the jurisdiction of the United 
Nations. 
  The article explains that ILO is the forum where workers, 
employers, and government officials gather to outline labor 
policies while the Union Freedom Committee, which is a 
tripartite forum, is responsible for raising these charges. In 
view of this, Hernandez del Valle says the Peruvian unions did 
not request sanctions. He says: "On the contrary, a couple of 
months ago we requested the nonenforcement of sanctions hoping 
the government will change its antilabor policy." 
  The report states that 16 charges have been raised against 
Peru which government officials believe are unjustified. It adds 
that very little is known about the new labor violation charges 
to be submitted this week in Geneva. 
  The article quotes government sources saying that there is 
willingness to resolve these problems, but it requires more 
understanding from workers. 
  The article provides a brief example of the charges raised 
by 
the workers last year, among which are violations of the right 
to join unions, collective bargaining agreements, and the right 
to strike. It adds that the detractors of the AFL-CIO are 
surprised that this U.S. organization has been chosen to defend 
Peruvian labor demands: Peruvian Government officials have 
stated that while Peru recognizes 66 ILO agreements, the U.S. 
Government recognizes only 11. 
  Peruvian Government officials believe the AFL-CIO proposal 
will not prosper, that the issue will be resolved in two months, 
and that no sanctions will be enforced against Peru. The article 
concludes with a quote by Union Leader Teodulo Hernandez who 
states: "There are more injustices against workers than against 
anyone else in this country. The government is the main 
perpetrator of these offenses and the one which abuses its 
powers to curtail our rights. We will no longer tolerate this. 
The time to fight has come because threats against us and other 
union leaders continue."

  [Excerpt] Havana, 25 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Cuban Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina reported today that the more than 150 
Cubans who have occupied the German, Belgian, and Chilean 
diplomatic missions over the past month have asked to travel to 
the United States. 
  The occupants, of which only 73 remain in the Belgian 
ambassador's residence and 21 in the German Embassy, 
discontinued their efforts to travel to the countries whose 
missions they invaded, the Cuban foreign minister asserted. 
  Robaina told almost 200 U.S. citizens, who came to Cuba as 
part of a campaign to challenge the Washington government's 
prohibition against U.S. citizens' travel to the island, about 
the occupation of diplomatic missions. He said the U.S. 
Interests Section in Havana has denied 40,000 visas to Cubans 
who had their documents in order and wanted to visit the United 
States this year. 
  "We could add the almost 150 Cubans in the embassies to 
those 
40,000 because they would not have acted by force if they knew 
they would achieve their objective through regular mechanisms," 
Robaina said. 
  Cuba and the United States have a valid immigration 
agreement, which was signed in 1987. The agreement stipulates 
that Washington will grant up to 20,000 entry visas to Cuban 
citizens every year. In reality, however, it only grants 
approximately 1,500 every year. 
  Robaina confirmed the Cuban Government's position that it 
will not authorize the people who occupied foreign missions by 
force to leave the country. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 24 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- It has been 
reported here that hundreds of Haitians are fleeing the country 
for fear of repression by the military. International 
commercial flights to Haiti stop at midnight tonight. 
  Shortly before the deadline set by the United States and 
Canada, U.S. airlines stopped flying to Haiti in compliance with 
the extension of the embargo declared by the UN Security Council 
against the Haitian military government. These measures, 
together with the cancellation of visas to Haitian businessmen, 
important civilian officials, and military officers, are 
designed to force the coupist government to step down and 
reinstate deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
  Stanley Schrager, U.S. Embassy spokesman in Port-au-Prince, 
has confirmed that petitions for asylum from approximately 1,000 
Haitians are being reviewed. If the petitions are approved, 
these Haitians will permitted to travel on chartered flights. 
  Meanwhile, internal repression is increasing in Haiti. The 
government of Emile Jonassaint, which has not been recognized 
internationally, has forbidden foreign journalists to travel 
outside the Haitian capital. 
  Today in Santo Domingo, President Joaquin Balaguer voiced 
his 
hope that the economic embargo against Haiti will come to an end 
soon, arguing that the Dominican Republic is having to spend 
enormous amounts of money to prevent contraband. Balaguer added 
that his country is strictly complying with the embargo by 
closely monitoring the border. Nevertheless, he did not rule 
out the possibility of a few gallons of fuel being smuggled 
across the extensive border. 
  Meanwhile, officials of the Balaguer government said they 
will move to ban the presence of foreign troops on Dominican 
territory to reinforce the economic embargo against Haiti. 
Deputy Foreign Minister Fabio Herrera Cabral said: "We cannot 
accept, whatsoever, the presence of foreign troops to reinforce 
the border." 
  Herrera Cabral's remarks came into response to President 
Carlos Menem's offer to dispatch Argentine troops to reinforce 
the embargo against Haiti. The offer had been made during 
Menem's meeting with President Bill Clinton in Washington. Two 
weeks ago, Argentina became a member of the "Friends of Haiti" 
group, which includes France, the United States, Canada, and 
Venezuela. 
  Herrera Cabral said the Dominican Republic is bearing the 
full financial burden of maintaining troops along the border 
without the assistance of any international organization.

  [Text] Police intelligence sources yesterday revealed the 
existence of a terrorist plot to justify attacks against members 
of the cabinet, individuals, and businesses as reprisals for the 
death threats politically irrelevant individuals are allegedly 
receiving. 
  They added those anonymously hiding behind the FRS 
[Salvadoran Revolutionary Front] are trying to effect an 
apparent "emotional outburst" against the individuals who have 
been accused in the past of being the possible perpetrators of 
violent incidents. 
  The sources stated it was known since early last week a 
communique reportedly from the self-styled FRS would be 
released. The FRS "condemns the threats against the human rights 
ombudsman, Monsignor Arturo Rivera y Damas, the Society of 
Jesus, and the National Judiciary Council" by a so-called 
"Domingo Monterrosa Command." 
  The communique added it declared the members of the Calderon 
cabinet, as well as this newspaper's staff and installations, to 
be "military objectives" if any attack is executed against those 
who have received threats. Intelligence sources have stated 
they had no prior knowledge of any group named Domingo 
Monterrosa, which only leftist chieftains mention, as they did 
with another ghost group they have called the "Maximiliano 
Hernandez Martinez Brigade," whose alleged members nobody has 
ever seen. 
  The plot, according to the sources, is clearly similar to 
the 
one the former FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] 
guerrillas used during the years of terror, when they took 
advantage of internal purges or the elimination of "expendable" 
or irrelevant figures to justify the selective murders of 
businessmen and democratically-minded ideologues. 
  The pattern, they said, greatly resembles the events 
following the bomb blast at the Fenastras [Salvadoran Workers 
National Union Federation] building in October 1989, an 
explosion which days later led to the offensive of late November 
of that year. The sources added the impact that the individuals 
hiding behind the FRS hope to obtain is an "emotional outburst" 
against those had been previously accused of incidents that led 
to violence. 
  EL DIARIO DE HOY was the target of an incendiary attack on 1 
November 1993, following a tirade by FMLN chieftain Joaquin 
Villalobos during the funeral of Heleno Castro Guevara, alias 
"Commander Carmelo." On that occasion, Villalobos accused the 
newspaper's editor of being the spokesman for the murderers of 
Castro Guevara, who, it was reported days later, was killed 
during an unpremeditated squabble prompted by a traffic accident. 
  On that occasion, the international community rejected 
Villalobos' attacks when the IAPA [Inter-American Press 
Association] issued a statement demanding the FMLN "abstain from 
attacking EL DIARIO DE HOY with words or deeds, urging this 
group to use the channels of the existent Salvadoran democratic 
system to peacefully express their own viewpoints."

  [Text] The Guatemalan Government Peace Commission and the 
Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity on 17 June in Oslo, 
Norway, signed the Agreement for the Resettlement of People 
Displaced by the Armed Conflict, which focuses on the creation 
of a technical commission. 
  As for the institutional arrangements detailed in 
Paragraph 2, Chapter 5 of the agreement, it is established that 
the commission will be made up of two government 
representatives, two representatives of the displaced persons, 
and two representatives of the donor and friendly countries and 
of international cooperation agencies, who will serve as 
advisers. 
  The agreement indicates that the Commission will be 
formed within 60 days after the signing of the this agreement. 
To this effect, the Guatemalan Government will issue the 
corresponding regulatory decree. 
  The agreement, signed before negotiations on mechanisms for 
the historical clarification of the past, introduces the 
definitions, principles, and objectives of general resettlement 
strategies. It also touches on guarantees for the same, the 
productive integration of displaced persons, development of 
resettled areas, international resources and cooperation, and 
institutional arrangements. 
  This last issue also contemplates the creation of a fund for 
the implementation of the resettlement agreement. The fund will 
be created with international community contributions, and the 
UNDP [United Nations Development Program] will manage the 
resources allocated for each project. 
  There is a paragraph on the security of people resettled in 
areas affected by the armed conflict, which recognizes the need 
to immediately remove all mines and explosive devices planted or 
left behind in these areas and for cooperation in these 
activities. 
  The parties agreed to request that UNESCO draft a plan to 
meet the educational needs of these people and to help them get 
their personal identification documents in order. 
  In conclusion, it is worth noting what the agreement 
stipulates on the land issue. We will seek to give greater 
facilities for the use of these lands to ensure their better use 
as established in the support, agricultural development, and 
other guidelines.

<F P=106> [Report by Paulo Sotero] </F>
  [Excerpts] Washington, 24 Jun (AE) -- Argentine President 
Carlos Menem, who two weeks ago caused an incident with Brazil 
in attempting to obtain Latin American support for the candidacy 
of Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari as chairman of 
the World Trade Organization (WTO), today said in Washington 
that the final decision on the subject will be made by the 
European Community. 
  His statement will probably exasperate the Brazilian 
Government, which is annoyed at Menem's attempt to undermine the 
candidacy of Brazilian Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero as WTO 
chairman during the Ibero-American Summit that took place in 
Cartagena, Colombia. [passage omitted] 
  Following a 30-minute meeting today with U.S. President Bill 
Clinton -- which was obtained after three months of negotiations 
-- Menem tried to explain his government's position regarding 
the WTO candidacy during a news conference. He did not confirm 
his support for the candidacy of Ricupero, whom he wrongly 
described as a "successful economist." The Argentine president 
said that when he arrived in Cartagena he did not know about 
Ricupero's candidacy, and that he suggested the name of Salinas 
"following a proposal made by the Colombian Government." 
  "Right now," Menem said, "there are two candidates from this 
continent, one from Mexico and the other one from the Federative 
Republic of Brazil." After saying this Menem got mixed up, and 
said: "Supposedly the candidacy will be defined by the members 
of the European Commission, and the candidate could be a 
European." 
  A reporter asked Menem for a better explanation. "The WTO is 
an organization from the European Community, it is not an 
international organization," the Argentine president said. "Or 
better yet," he corrected himself, "it is an international 
organization but it is an organization from the European 
Community." 
  Menem traveled to Orlando, Florida, this evening, where he 
will watch the soccer match between the Argentine and Nigerian 
soccer teams. As he is known for bringing bad luck, he will 
apparently comply with a petition by the Argentine soccer 
players, and will watch the match on television "for reasons of 
superstition," he said.

  [Text] General Juan Evaristo Gonzalez Maldonado, the 
Military Supreme Court president, has noted that there are 
newspapers, groups, and people who unceasingly and "viciously" 
attack the Armed Forces. 
  Gonzalez said that the tasks carried out by the Armed Forces 
are not fully understood, "perhaps because of ignorance, or 
maybe through malice." 
  During the main ceremony to mark Military Courts Day, 
Gonzalez stressed: "The task carried out by the Armed Forces is 
not always fully understood, perhaps because of ignorance, or 
maybe through malice. Therefore, some people, groups, and 
newspapers are unceasingly attacking--more than often 
viciously--the Armed Forces." 
  In his speech the general reproached critics of the Armed 
Forces for not admitting or remembering that the Armed Forces, 
like the entire country, are evolving "due to the political, 
economic, and social transition." 
  In another passage of his speech, Gen. Juan Evaristo 
Gonzalez 
Maldonado emphasized that the military echelons, "subordinated 
to the established power through the chain of command, 
consciously and effectively observe allegiance to their 
commander in chief and president of the Republic, engineer Juan 
Carlos Wasmosy." 
<H5>  Incorruptible Guardians </H5>
  Gonzalez noted that the Armed Forces "are incorruptible 
guardians of our fatherland's most precious assets, that is, its 
sovereignty, its border security, and above all its unrestricted 
fulfillment of the constitutional provision that guarantees to 
all citizens freedom, democracy, and the normal development of 
the established institutions." 
  The general also reported on the establishment and 
development of military courts in our country. 
  Gonzalez also emphasized that the Military Supreme Court 
fulfills a specific duty aimed at safeguarding the military 
coexistence codes. 
  In this regard Gonzalez explained that there is a special 
commission involved in preparing bills to adjust the Military 
Supreme Court's activities to constitutional provisions.

  [Text] Mexico City 23 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Today, the Mexican 
Foreign Relations Secretariat announced that the government has 
presented the candidacy of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari 
to assume the post of director general of the World Trade 
Organization [WTO]. 
  The Foreign Secretariat announced in a communique that the 
candidacy of Salinas, whose presidential mandate ends in 
December, is being presented because the chiefs of state who 
participated in the Fourth Ibero-American Summit supported the 
Mexican president's aspiration to that post. The summit among 
the chiefs of state of Latin America, Spain, and Portugal took 
place last week in the Colombian port city of Cartagena de 
Indias. 
  Spain and Portugal withheld their support because of 
commitments in other international forums, but the rest of the 
heads of state who are members of the Ibero-American forum 
agreed that Salinas would properly represent the interests of 
the Latin American nations. 
  The WTO will replace GATT as of 1 January 1995 as part of 
the 
agreements reached at the 15 April meeting in Marrakesh. 
  Jacques Delors, president of the European Union; Brazilian 
Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero; and former Italian Commerce 
Minister Renato Ruggiero have also been named as possible 
candidates for the post of WTO director general.

  [Text] Congress is questioning Finance Minister Julio Sosa 
Rodriguez about his performance during the nation's current 
financial crisis. 
  A vote of censure on the finance minister's performance 
could 
be taken today during the congressional session since a majority 
of legislators are criticizing Sosa, as well as the other 
cabinet ministers, for not having declared a state of financial 
emergency. 
  According to Pedro Tabata Guzman, deputy head of the 
Democratic Action bloc, there will soon be a need to implement 
exchange controls. 
  Deputy Tabata thus responded to questions regarding this 
Wednesday's increase in the value of the U.S. dollar. 
  [Begin recording] [Tabata, in progress] ...not just that 
measure will be recommended. I believe we will also have to 
recommend importation controls, but only on certain goods. 
Without a doubt, we will need to implement currency exchange 
controls. [end recording] 
  Deputy Tabata Guzman also pointed out that the special 
commission appointed to evaluate the summons of Finance Minister 
Julio Sosa Rodriguez will also summon Development Minister 
Alberto Poletto and Luis Carlos Palacios, Central Office of 
Coordination and Planning chief. 
  Deputy Gustavo Tarre Briceno, president of the Chamber of 
Deputies Finance Commission, believes the increase in the value 
of the U.S. dollar is a result of the prevailing distrust in the 
market. 
  [Begin recording] [Tarre Briceno, in progress] ...the manner 
in which the intervention process was handled, the absence of a 
genuine and coherent economic program, and inadequate 
coordination between public officials result in significant 
distrust. All of this leads to a distrust in the banking system, 
which leads to withdrawals by account holders, who, not trusting 
anyone, prefer to purchase more U.S. dollars. That is what has 
caused the price of the U.S. dollar to exceed the 200 bolivares 
mark, and the logical consequence of all of this is more 
inflation. [end recording] 
  In this respect, Deputy Tarre Briceno stressed that it is 
very likely the inflation rate will reach three digits.

  [Excerpts] Supreme Court President Luis Serpa Segura 
reported that on 13 June, the Supreme Court ordered an 
investigation into the release of three Shining Path [SL] 
leaders. This investigation is to be conducted by the Office 
for Judicial Overview. Serpa explained that "Office for 
Judicial Overview chief Carlos Giusti Acuna has been duly 
informed. We hope a preliminary report will be submitted 
sometime this week." 
  A television report, disclosed a few days ago, said that the 
judicial branch ordered Luis Alberto Arana Franco, also known as 
"Abel;" Juan Carlos Rios Fernandez, also known as "Norman;" and 
Monica Feria Tinta, all of whom are SL leaders, released from 
jail. 
  It was learned that Luis Alberto Arana Franco, also known as 
"Comrade Abel," a SL leader in charge of the logistics apparatus 
that operated at the Cesar Vallejo academy, is on parole. On 13 
June, Daniel Espichan, special prosecutor for terrorist crimes, 
said Arana Franco's sentence was commuted because he helped 
disrupt important SL groups. Espichan added that Arana Franco 
continues to supply information to antisubversive forces. He 
explained that after he finishes testifying, Arana Franco will 
be given a new identity and will leave the country with his 
family. 
  Those who resort to the "repentance" law can be exempted 
from 
prosecution and punishment; they can change their identities and 
leave the country with a small amount of money whenever it is 
approved by a small committee that works in utmost secrecy. 
  Serpa stated that so far, several of those who resorted to 
the "repentance" law have been granted new identities because 
several SL members were arrested through their testimony. He 
added that all of them have been allotted money until they get 
jobs. 
  Juan Carlos Rios Fernandez and Jesus Monica Feria Tinta 
[name 
as published], as well as 27 other terrorists who were released 
by the courts, are in a different situation because requests 
were submitted to the Supreme Court to nullify their sentences. 
Serpa stated: "These judges are obviously biased." He 
explained that some members of faceless courts are reportedly 
being subjected to "pressure" or to accept "bribes." [passage 
omitted] 
  So far the faceless courts have sentenced only two or three 
and absolved the rest. 
  Carlos Blanco, president of the congressional Human Rights 
Committee, has demanded that the Office for Judicial Overview 
conduct an exhaustive investigation. Blanco believes, 
nevertheless, that this situation resulted from a 
misinterpretation of the repentance law. 
  Moreover, Justice Committee President Cesar Fernandez (NM) 
[New Majority] will submit a bill to close the "legal loopholes" 
in the antiterrorist law that have allowed the release of SL 
leaders. Fernandez Arce has demanded drastic punishment for 
those judges responsible for this release. 
  Fernandez Arce specifically requested that the special 
prosecutor for terrorist crimes be duly informed about the court 
rulings so he can appeal these decisions. Prior to the Attorney 
General's Office decision, any release ordered by a "faceless 
court" should be subjected to a Supreme Court review.

  [Text] (TELAM) -- Yesterday, President Carlos Menem said 
the person who will make the decision of postponing the deadline 
for choosing a pensions system "is the president of the 
Republic." The president characterized the results of his 
meetings in Canada and the United States as "very good." Upon 
returning to the country, he said: "The decision for Argentina 
to join NAFTA has practically been made," but "everything 
depends on the invitation." 
  Menem said his meeting with Bill Clinton was "very 
important," characterizing his meeting with former President 
George Bush as "very friendly and informal." 
  Menem said that pressure from the United States for the 
approval of a patents law will decrease in the near future. 
Menem said the government "will insist" that ruling party 
legislators approve the draft bill that it will submit to 
Congress soon. 
  The Tango 01 plane that brought the president back to the 
country landed at 0630 at the military section of the 
metropolitan airport. Travelling with Menem were, among others, 
his daughter Zulema, Military Household Chief Jorge Rearte, and 
Media Secretary Raul Burzaco. 
  During a brief news conference, Menem said: "A decision for 
Argentina to join NAFTA has practically been made," but 
"everything depends on the requirements or the invitation." 
<H5>  Haiti </H5>
  Menem reaffirmed that Argentina will contribute to the 
political and economic embargo against Haiti, and that the 
country will send more troops to the area "if they are required 
for maintaining the peace." Menem added: "Congress will have to 
approve the decision" if Argentina is required to participate in 
an attempt to reinstate democracy in the Caribbean state through 
armed intervention or an invasion. 
<H5>  Patents </H5>
  Menem said that "pressure" to approve a pharmaceutical 
patents law "will decrease in the near future." The president 
added: "The situation created by the U.S. demands has been 
practically overcome" following his meeting with Clinton. "In 
the future, the dialogue will be more fluid, and we will insist 
that legislators pass the draft bill with the amendments we will 
submit at the appropriate time," Menem said. 
<H5>  Postponement </H5>
  Menem said: "The economy and labor ministers only gave their 
opinions" on the issue of postponing the deadline for choosing a 
pensions system, adding that it was an "outrage to move for a 
political trial just because they made comments about a bill." 
  The president stressed that ministers made an "assessment" 
of 
people who might be temporarily incorporated into the Retirement 
and Pension Fund Managing Companies if by the end of the month 
they have not chosen a system, adding that ministers have not 
decided anything because "the person who will decide on the 
matter is the president of the Republic." "I do not think a 
minister can be tried in Congress just because he gave his 
opinion on a draft bill that has not been approved yet," Menem 
said.

<F P=106> [Article by unidentified special correspondent in Ottawa] </F>
  [Text] Argentina confirmed on 20 June that it might "begin 
a legal battle" to stop the sale of Canadian wheat to Brazil at 
subsidized prices. The slump in wheat quotations resulting from 
this move has caused Argentine producers to lose $180 million. 
  Felipe Sola, the agriculture, livestock, and fishing 
secretary, met with his Canadian counterpart Ralph Goodale for 
one of the most complicated negotiations of President Carlos 
Menem's state visit to Canada, which is taking place without 
other problems. 
  The issue is complex. Beside the losses incurred, Argentine 
authorities know the expected stabilization of the Brazilian 
economy would reverberate on the market, causing quotations to 
tumble even further. 
  The diplomatic side of the issue adds its share of 
complexity. Indeed, Argentina must try to convince Canada to 
review its actions and, at the same time, prevent Brazil from 
getting annoyed over the resulting increase in the prices of 
their imports. 
  The Argentine Government needs the support of Brazil, one of 
the beneficiaries of the deal in question, in this issue since 
one of the possible legal battles will probably be fought within 
the Mercosur [Common Market of the South] agreements. The other 
front would be GATT. 
  Nevertheless, Argentine negotiators have an advantage over 
their Canadian counterparts. By Canadian standards, to be 
accused of dumping is a very serious insult. Canadian officials 
are therefore willing to go overboard to prevent such an 
awe-inspiring "stigma." 
  Canadians are proud of their fair-play in trade -- even 
though Argentina sometimes disagrees. They boast that "the 
United States has on several occasions charged us with unfair 
competition practices, but could never prove our guilt." 
  The Argentine decision could be the acid test of incipient 
Mercosur mechanisms, prompted by the fact that Canadian trade 
practices triggered a drop of at least $20 per tonne of wheat. 
  One may wonder how much of the $180 million can be recovered 
by Argentina as a result of these negotiations. So far, 
considering that there are three parties involved, most 
estimates do not exceed 30 percent while others go a bit further.

  [Text] Retired Army Chief General Hector Rios Erenu said he 
was skeptical about the elimination of compulsory military 
service for "economic reasons." He said: "If we do not have the 
money, we cannot implement it. I think it is practically 
impossible," the former military chief added. Rios Erenu was 
the Army commander during the first "painted faces" revolt in 
April 1987. 
  General Carlos Quevedo, 3d Army Corps commander, did not 
want 
to commit himself to either one or the other system. Asked to 
compare the compulsory and voluntary services, he said: The two 
systems "have comparative advantages." 
<H5>  Coincidences </H5>
  Quevedo said that some requirements must be met for the 
implementation of the voluntary system. "It all depends on 
certain conditions," he added. Rios Erenu and Quevedo agreed on 
some of those conditions. 
  "We are going through a very difficult economic moment in 
Argentina. National defense is not a priority," said Erenu, who 
was military commander during the Raul Alfonsin administration. 
He warned about an Army budget, "loss of potential, and 
insufficiency," adding that the 240 million pesos approved by 
the Economy Ministry "will not be enough" to eliminate the 
compulsory military service. 
<H5>  Creation of Reserves </H5>
  The retired military officer said the alternative system 
proposed by the government "is viable" only if "a series of 
changes" are introduced into the 1901 Recheri law, such as the 
creation of an Army reserve. 
  Rios Erenu said "it is not appropriate" to incorporate "a 
mass of voluntary workers" unless we can equip them. He said 
that the salaries of Army troops, as well those of the rest of 
the Armed Forces and Border Police personnel, "are terribly 
outdated," adding that this specifically influences the forces' 
performance.

  [Text] Brasilia -- Yesterday, President Itamar Franco 
threatened to use the antitrust law, which provides for prison 
sentences, to prevent supermarkets from making abusive price 
increases. Presidential spokesman Fernando Costa said: "The 
government will not permit any incitement to civil disobedience 
like that suggested by Levy Nogueira, president of Abram 
(Brazilian Supermarkets Association)." Yesterday, Nogueira 
reaffirmed his earlier remarks that the prices of 10 percent of 
the products sold in supermarkets will have to be marked up due 
to the effects of the end of the harvest season. He denied, 
however, having called for civil disobedience. 
  Costa said: "The president has emphasized that supermarkets 
will not mark up their prices, as the government will use 
existing legal mechanisms to discourage this type of crime 
against the public economy." President Franco has called for a 
meeting with Justice Minister Alexandre Dupeyrat and legal 
adviser Geraldo Magela Quintao to discuss the subject tomorrow. 
Last night, Dupeyrat ordered that Nogueira's companies -- the 
Epa supermarkets in Belo Horizonte -- be monitored. Commenting 
on Nogueira's remarks, a friend of Franco's, who was at Planalto 
Palace yesterday, said: "The president was stunned by such a 
display of brazenness." 
  Franco called Costa into his office yesterday morning during 
a meeting he was holding with Dupeyrat. Franco said: "The 
government will adopt measures that will in no way allow 
supermarket prices to be marked up, such as was proposed by Mr. 
Levy Nogueira." Late in the morning, before leaving Planalto 
Palace to have lunch at Alvorada Palace, Franco asked Costa if 
he had released the presidential message to the press. 
  Nogueira learned about the president's reaction from 
reporters in Rio de Janeiro shortly before attending a meeting 
between supermarket representatives and Finance Ministry special 
adviser Jose Milton Dallari. Showing first surprise and then 
tension, Nogueira charged the press with giving a sensationalist 
tone to his remarks and denied having called for civil 
disobedience. He said: "The reports distorted my remarks, as 
there are always price adjustments in any stable economy." He 
added: "I have not talked about price markups because 90 percent 
of the supermarket prices have already been adjusted." 
  Mogueira confirmed, however, that nearly 700 products of 
medium-sized supermarkets and 1,500 products of large 
supermarkets will be adjusted under the real. "Beef and coffee 
prices are rising in URV's [real value units]," he said. He 
stated, however, that there will be a declining trend for the 
prices of manufactured products in July because the current 
industrial prices are padded. 
  Other supermarket representatives who attended the meeting 
with Dallari also conveyed surprise at Franco's remarks. Aylton 
Fornari, president of the Rio de Janeiro State Association of 
Supermarkets (Asserj), said: "The government may not tolerate 
price abuses, but supermarkets are being forced to tolerate the 
disobedience of government officials who issue currency without 
due backing." Upon leaving the meeting, Dallari, who was 
recently rebuked by the president for stating his opposition to 
the rules for converting school tuition into URV's, said 
tersely: "I agree with the president: He is right."

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the scheduled 3 October 
general elections. 
  PDT-PP Alliance in Minas Gerais -- The Minas Gerais office 
of 
the Democratic Labor Party, PDT, decided on 6 June to support 
the Popular Party, PP, candidate for the state's governorship, 
Helio Costa. In exchange Costa will allow PDT presidential 
candidate Leonel Brizola to take part in his rallies. According 
to Brizola, this alliance "will open up new possibilities not 
only in Minas Gerais, but also in the rest of Brazil." It has 
also been decided that Senator Darcy Ribeiro, vice presidential 
candidate on Brizola's ticket, will concentrate his electoral 
campaign in Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Rio de Janeiro. (Rio 
de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 7 Jun 94 p 6) 
  Paraiba PMDB Not To Support Lula -- The decision of the PT 
gubernatorial candidate in Paraiba State, Avenzoar Arruda, not 
to give up his candidacy has caused former Paraiba Governor 
Ronaldo Cunha Lima, who is the local Brazilian Democratic 
Movement Party leader and Senate candidate on Antonio Mariz' 
ticket, to withdraw his support for the presidential candidacy 
of the PT's Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. (Rio de Janeiro JORNAL

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities monitored through 23 June. 
  This year, the foreign and domestic debt of the federal 
government increased 18.4 percent. In December 1993, it 
totalled 157.8 trillion real cruzeiros and 187 trillion real 
cruzeiros in May 1994. The domestic debt increased the most (23 
percent), going from 95.6 trillion real cruzeiros to 117.6 
trillion real cruzeiros. The main reason for this increase was 
the issuance of public certificates, the stock of which went up 
from 62.2 trillion real cruzeiros to 69.3 trillion real 
cruzeiros. (Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 21 
Jun 94 Business and Finance Section p 1) 
  The greatest volume of savings account deposits since the 
implementation of the Collor Plan was registered in May, as 53.3 
trillion real cruzeiros were deposited, equivalent to 5.1 
percent of GDP. In February 1990, one month before Collor came 
to power, savings account deposits were equivalent to 5.4 
percent of GDP, a figure that dropped following the freeze on 
bank accounts. The lowest savings deposit volume was registered 
in November 1991, when it amounted to 2.9 percent of GDP. 
  Savings accounts are sought by the public because of their 
monthly earnings, and because it has been guaranteed that the 
savings rules will not change. Savings account deposits are 
expected to increase in June, as the large investors have 
already detected that they will be one of the best investments 
with the implementation of the real. Savings accounts have now 
become the second favorite option in the financial system, 
following private title applications, which are equivalent to 
7.4 percent of GDP. Federal public titles come third, with 
applications equivalent to 4.7 percent of GDP. State and 
municipal titles come fourth, with applications equivalent to 3 
percent of GDP. Financial Investment Funds, FAF, and Special 
Interest-Bearing Deposits, DEF, come fifth, with applications 
equivalent to 1.1 and 0.5 percent of GDP respectively. (Rio de 
Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 22 Jun 94 Business and 
Finance Section p 5)

<F P=106> [By Carlos Fazio: "Haiti, Clinton To Sacrifice Cedras"] </F>
  [Text] [No dateline as received] At last, the Clinton 
administration seems ready to stage its democratic show in 
Haiti. For the friends of future surgical intervention aimed at 
ousting General Raoul Cedras and his military command from power 
-- under the umbrella of a "multilateral force" comprising 
English-speaking Caribbean countries and organized by the 
Pentagon -- word got out that Washington is promoting "a golden 
exile" for those that were once its allies. The administration 
sponsors, protects, and, if necessary, sacrifices its allies, 
but it sometimes -- as seems to be the current case -- protects 
them when they fall from grace. It is no secret that, when 
Jean-Claude Duvalier fled, the U.S. State Department prepared a 
"democratic transition" for the island that was to become 
legitimized by free elections, of course. Washington had its 
candidate for the first clean elections following several 
decades of the U.S.-backed Duvalier dictatorship. 
  The only thing was that it did not take imponderable factors 
into consideration and lost. The majority of the people of Haiti 
voted for a man who won the masses with his charisma, a Salesian 
priest, and supporter of the doctrine of liberation, who is 
therefore at odds with Karol Wojtyla [Pope John Paul II]. 
  From the day of Jean-Bertrand's victory, the U.S. 
intelligence community began to conspire to oust him. Aristide 
barely lasted seven months in power. The man who toppled him, 
General Raoul Cedras, has close ties with the Pentagon. He did 
not act, therefore, on his own initiative. 
  One must keep in mind that during the republican 
administration of George Bush, Haiti was handled under the Cold 
War perception, and a sign of that was the presence of Alvin 
Adams in the U.S. mission in Port-au-Prince. He is a man with 
outdated views, a career diplomat who was in Saigon and served 
as assistant secretary to Henry Kissinger, former U.S. secretary 
of state. An expert on the counterinsurgency struggle, Alvin 
coordinated matters against terrorism at the State Department 
from 1987 to 1989. It was no coincidence, either, that the 
first one to be promoted to chief of the coupist junta was Marc 
Charles, who served as military attache in Washington, although 
the decision was later rescinded. 
  There are sufficient elements that show the U.S. double 
standard. While condemning the coup, it sent signals to the 
members of the de facto government that they were allies. 
  The UN and OAS involvement, as well as the active 
participation of France and Venezuela, which have specific 
interests in Haiti, in search of a solution that would restore 
constitutional rule with the ouster of the coupists and the 
reinstatement of Aristide, complicated Washington's original 
plans. 
  The double standard remained a constant. That way, while on 
the one hand an apartment was arranged for Aristide in 
Washington and he was given facilities to maintain his own 
activities as president in exile, on the other hand, the CIA was 
orchestrating a dirty propaganda campaign against Aristide, 
depicting him as a messianic madman, who instigated the practice 
of "necklacing" -- inserting victims in burning tires -- against 
men in uniform. 
  Today, confused by his own contradictions and encumbered by 
several unresolved international conflicts, Clinton seems to be 
determined to find a cheap solution to the Haitian problem. 
  It all seems to indicate that there will be an end to the 
crisis in the short-term. THE MIAMI HERALD newspaper reported 
that a true invasion of secret agents has taken place on the 
island. "Every U.S. espionage service has sent its agents and 
collaborators to the Caribbean island," the newspaper reported. 
Obviously, they did not go to Port-au-Prince as tourists. 
  Likewise, a confidential CIA report on the "increasing 
uneasiness" within the Haitian military has been disclosed, 
according to THE NEW YORK TIMES. The newspaper revealed that 
the United States is reportedly trying to convince Gen. Cedras, 
the head of the junta; Michel Francois, chief of police and, for 
many, the real power behind the throne; and Philippe Biamby, 
cabinet chief of the Army, to abandon power in exchange for a 
comfortable life in exile. 
  To encourage military dissent, Clinton has reportedly 
decided 
to promote an old Aristide demand: to set up a radio station 
from a mobile ship to transmit hostile propaganda against the 
military. The project, called Radio Democracy, would have three 
objectives: to persuade the troops to get rid of the military 
threesome, to convince the mid-level officers that they would 
not be punished for the repression unleashed during the military 
regime, and to discourage the Haitian population from massively 
leaving the island because they will not be given political 
exile in the United States. 
  According to Pentagon officials, Radio Democracy could begin 
transmitting in a few weeks through special units operating from 
planes that will fly over Haiti at low speeds. 
  Some of these measures, which are now being promoted by the 
Black Caucus in the U.S. Congress, could have been taken 15 
months ago and the deaths of thousands of Haitians could have 
been avoided. 
  According to Steven Forester, Haitian Refugee Center 
supervisor, the Armed Forces under the command of Gen. Cedras 
have executed at least 7,000 persons since the 1991 coup. 
Forester described the U.S. immigration policy as "obscene, 
racist, and criminal." According to him, not even the 7,000 
persons who have been executed since the coup could have met the 
requirements of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service 
to find asylum in the United States. 
  On the other hand, he pointed out that Washington approves 
96 
percent of the requests for refugee status filed by immigrants 
from the defunct USSR and 83 percent of those from citizens of 
Asian countries and welcomes Cuban boat people as long as they 
leave the island illegally, and as a reward it grants them U.S. 
citizenship within a year. 
  Forester indicated that the United States has been a "deaf 
accomplice" of the atrocities committed by Haitian military 
officers and their paramilitary groups and pointed out that the 
obligatory repatriation of the boat people never had a 
humanitarian distinction. 
  Obviously, the departure of Cedras, Francois, Biamby, and 
company and the return of Aristide to the Presidency is a 
desirable and appropriate thing. The big question is why 
Washington decided to promote the change now.

  [Text] Washington, 27 Jun (PL) -- Processing Haitian 
refugees on the high seas, as recommended by the White House, 
has become the largest operation conducted in 50 years by the 
U.S. Coast Guard and the costliest operation ever. 
  Just the floating processing platforms -- two vessels off 
the 
coast of Jamaica -- cost the U.S. taxpayer some $120,000 a day, 
the Florida SUN-SENTINEL reveals today. The use of the Coast 
Guard Cutter Hamilton costs $2,100 per hour while its six 
accompanying helicopters cost $750 each for the same amount of 
time. Meanwhile, daily fuel expenses for the hospital ship USS 
Comfort, used as a processing center, run as high as $15,300. 
  The operation entails intercepting the so-called boat people 
[previous two words in English], examining their asylum requests 
on the floating platforms, and repatriating those who are not 
eligible. 
  The process involves eight Navy vessels, 15 Coast Guard 
vessels, and hundreds of immigration officials. The cost of 
this process will probably continue to rise as more Haitians try 
to escape. 
  "This is the largest operation conducted by the U.S. Coast 
Guard since World War II. Between the vessels of the U.S. Coast 
Guard and those of the Navy, the United States has never had so 
many vessels off the Haitian coastline," Lieutenant Commander 
Jim Howe told the newspaper. The Pentagon plans to spend 
another $65 million in the next four months. Those funds will 
also be used to meet the needs of eight U.S. Navy vessels 
patrolling the Haitian coast. 
  Ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, meanwhile, 
expressed 
opposition to Washington's plan to discourage Haitians from 
trying to leave their country in rafts. U.S. authorities fear 
that an exodus might crowd the floating platform to process 
refugees. 
  Since this operation began a week ago, 194 Haitians have 
been 
interviewed, 52 were deemed eligible to seek asylum while the 
rest were repatriated. 
  However, since 24 June, when Washington decided to tighten 
economic sanctions against the coupist leadership, another 800 
have been intercepted on the high seas.

  [Text] Havana, 24 Jun (PL) -- A Cuban female citizen who 
had been sentenced to five years for subversive crimes flew to 
Spain after local authorities released her before she had served 
her full sentence, PRENSA LATINA confirmed today. 
  The woman is Aurea Genoveva Feria Cao, 51 years old, who was 
sentenced in 1990 for spreading enemy propaganda after her 
activities to destabilize the Cuban Government were proven. 
  Reliable sources reported that the woman was released before 
she had served her full sentence as the result of talks with the 
Spanish Government, particularly Galician authorities. 
  Asked by PRENSA LATINA last night about the Cuban 
authorities' decision to approve her trip to Spain, Feria Cao 
said: I appreciate this gesture very much. 
  Feria Cao, mother of four children, two of whom traveled 
with 
her, said she was not mistreated while in prison but that 
serving time was a very hard thing in her life because she had 
been a housewife. I would rather have served my five-year 
sentence in the state's security installations, she said about 
the time she served in prison. 
  Asked about her plans for the future, she said: I will not 
participate in political activities. She also announced her 
intention to reside in Spain. I will devote myself to my 
children and my home, she said.

<F P=106> [Unsigned article: "The End of the Occupation of Diplomatic </F>
Buildings"] 
  [Text] Havana, 24 Jun (PL) -- The recent departure from the 
Chilean Consulate of all the Cubans who had been occupying it 
and the departure of some of the people who had been occupying a 
Belgian diplomatic building here are apparently serving to 
expedite a conclusion to an episode that was more the result of 
manipulation than desperation. 
  According to official sources, the incidents during which 
more than 100 citizens forcefully entered the residence of the 
Belgian ambassador, approximately 20 other persons entered the 
German Embassy, and 10 persons entered the Chilean Consulate 
some weeks ago were the products of a "clumsy political 
manipulation" by enemies of the revolution. 
  The forcible entries into those missions took place just 
before and during the celebration of the Fourth Ibero-American 
Summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, and one occurred on the 
day Mexican President Carlos Salinas was to arrive in Cuba. 
Local authorities viewed this forcible entry as a calculated 
provocation. 
  The incidents at the Chilean Consulate took place on 15 
June, 
the day before President Fidel Castro's scheduled meeting with 
Chilean President Eduardo Frei in the Colombia city. 
  Considering the need to guarantee the security of the 
missions accredited to the island and to keep these methods from 
being systematically used as a way of leaving the country, the 
Cuban Government has declared that it will not grant a departure 
permit to anyone who enters a diplomatic installation by force, 
even if that person later leaves the facility. 
  The Foreign Ministry announced this position, which allows 
for no exceptions, and reiterated that such actions are promoted 
from abroad for political propaganda reasons. The ministry 
added that the people who carry out such actions suffer no 
political persecution but are motivated by familial, individual, 
and economic considerations, and some by a spirit of adventure. 
  PRENSA LATINA has interviewed people who have permits to 
travel to the United States but who are awaiting U.S. visas. 
They complain about unjustified visa refusals, which, in their 
opinion, leads some people, especially the young, to resort to 
illegal departures or to forceful entries at diplomatic missions. 
  The Foreign Ministry declaration states that the local 
authorities have adopted a position which has been backed by 
persuasive actions aimed at making the occupants leave the 
buildings. These persuasive actions have been adopted jointly 
with the involved diplomats. The local authorities' position 
was adopted as an expression of Cuba's goodwill toward the 
governments negatively affected by the situation and to 
facilitate a quick solution to the problem. 
  Government sources have reported that there are 72 persons 
in 
the Belgian Embassy (53 have already left and resumed their 
daily lives without difficulties) and 21 in the German Embassy, 
who have stubbornly refused to abandon their stance, which has 
been described as illegal and irresponsible.

<F P=106> [By Ulises Canales: "Cuba-Emigration: Charges of </F>
Manipulation in the Granting of U.S. Visas"] 
  [Text] Havana, 22 Jun (PL) -- Dozens of Cubans are trying 
to leave the country by occupying foreign embassies while the 
United States manipulates the granting of visas to thousands of 
citizens who have all their documents in order. 
  Those who want to travel to the neighbor country who have 
been interviewed by PRENSA LATINA have denounced how the U.S. 
Interests Section in Havana denies visas. This situation in 
recent months has become more prevalent because of political 
reasons. 
  Some of those interviewed, after insisting that they remain 
anonymous for fear of reprisal from U.S. diplomats (an eventual 
definite denial of visa), said they believe that the forced 
entries by 150 people into the diplomatic missions of Belgium, 
Germany, and Chile in this capital are a result of U.S. 
immigration restrictions. 
  Sitting around the U.S. Interests Section building as they 
wait for an answer to their requests to meet with their 
relatives, the applicants noted that the majority of the people 
who entered the missions by force have stated their desire for 
visas to travel to the United States, which is the main 
destination of those who want to leave the island. 
  Foreign media, and the U.S. media, in particular, report on 
the forceful entry into the embassies and on the country's 
difficult situation. A worker criticized this reporting by 
pointing out the notorious silence such media maintains 
regarding the other side of the coin: the closing or blocking 
of legal departure methods. 
  In 1984, Havana and Washington signed an immigration 
agreement in which the United States would renew its 
preferential visa granting to Cuban immigrants with residence in 
Cuba, to allow up to 20,000 visas annually. This renewed 
preferential visa granting applied especially to close relatives 
of U.S. citizens and Cuban residents in that country. 
  U.S. compliance with this agreement has been poor, said a 
lady who has already traveled once but who is, as she said, 
aware of the fact that sometimes political interests prevail 
over the interests of people who have nothing to do with 
politics. 
  According to official Cuban statistics, in 1993 the U.S. 
Interests Section approved only 1,000 of the 20,000 visas it 
could have approved for Cubans who had requested them in order 
to spend time with their relatives in the United States. 
  In 1993, Cuba authorized the departure of approximately 
100,000 people who wanted to visit the U.S., but only 30,000 
made it. Of those who made it, most were people over 40. The 
rest had their visa requests denied by the Interests Section, 
which from July 1991 to May 1992 suspended visa processing 
because they claimed that visa requests had stockpiled 
considerably. 
  People who in recent days visited the Interests Section have 
told PRENSA LATINA that on one day six visas were granted, out 
of 300 applications, and that on the next day another six out of 
260 applications were granted. An elderly lady said: "Judging 
from what I heard from those who visited the Interests Section 
this morning and from several dozen people who have already come 
out of there, only one visa has been granted. 
  No one is certain about being chosen for travel, but the 
young find it more uncertain, according to comments heard by 
this reporter in the "park of the wailing," a plaza near the 
U.S. Interests Section where impatient applicants meet and where 
rejected applicants reflect on their pain. 
  Another person interviewed did not dispute that constant 
visa 
refusals encourage illegal departures, but that person refused 
to accept that hypothesis as conclusive, because this would lead 
to the belief that all who want to visit their relatives have 
the objective of remaining there and this, he emphasized, is not 
so. 
  After spending hours, days, and even weeks coming and going 
and forming lines to enter the Interests Section building (many 
from the countryside rent rooms nearby or sleep in the open), 
the applicants may have to face a rejection of their 
application, in which case they must wait one year before being 
able to present a new application.

<F P=106> [Article by Javier Rodriguez] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 24 Jun (PL) -- Official sources told PRENSA 
LATINA today that the fact that almost 70 illegal occupiers of 
diplomatic missions in Havana have changed their mind proves the 
success of the Cuban Government's position in these cases. 
  Foreign Ministry sources confirmed that, while unexpected 
visitors decided to leave the Chilean Consulate in Havana 
yesterday, almost 60 of those who remained inside the Belgian 
ambassador's residence under similar conditions have already 
voluntarily returned to their homes. 
  The departure of those who forcibly entered the two missions 
obviously responded to the certainty that the Cuban decision, 
which is meant to prevent actions of this type from replacing 
the legal procedures used to leave the country, will not change. 
  In addition, the Cuban Government thought that this policy 
was the most appropriate measure to protect the properties of 
the diplomatic corps in Cuba from the use of violence against 
them, in keeping with obligations established in international 
conventions. 
  The situation inside the Belgian residence, according to the 
information disclosed, points to increasing discouragement among 
those who remain inside and leads one to the belief that members 
of the group that entered the residence on 28 May will continue 
leaving. 
  The internal order at the occupied residence is currently 
under the responsibility of specialized Belgian personnel 
following media reports, sent even from Brussels, that revealed 
a verbal confrontation between some of the occupiers and the 
Belgian representatives. 
  Meanwhile, 21 persons are living in the German Embassy. 
These 21 persons, who entered the embassy after stealing a 
truck and ramming it against the fence surrounding the building, 
will have to answer for this crime once they leave the mission, 
according to statements by the Cuban Government. As the number 
of people who have decided to leave other delegations increases, 
so does the isolation of those remaining at the German Embassy. 
  Judging from this situation, everything indicates that this 
episode involving the violation of the immunity of diplomatic 
missions could be coming to an end sooner rather than later. 
These actions began a few weeks ago, and Cubans believe they 
were basically inspired by a permanent U.S. hostility against 
Cuba.

  [Text] Havana, 24 Jun (PL) -- U.S. Congressman Ronald V. 
Dellums, from California, has expressed support for the mission 
of the group "Freedom to Travel," which has defied U.S. 
restrictions impeding U.S. citizens from traveling to Cuba. 
  During a news conference today in this capital, Medea 
Benjamin, the group spokesperson, read a letter from Delluns in 
which he views as unconstitutional and senseless the limitations 
on travel to Cuba. 
  The letter reads: "I greet with clear understanding those 
who visit Cuba, and I reject the official White House policy. I 
join you in the continuous legislative efforts made to lift this 
historic Cold War foolishness, and I bid all of you success." 
  According to U.S. laws, U.S. citizens who visit Havana 
without a special permit may be fined up to $250,000 or face 
10-year prison sentences for violating the 1917 Trading With the 
Enemy Law and the economic blockade imposed on Cuba more than 
three decades ago. 
  Benjamin said the note, which she views as unusual from a 
representative of the U.S. Congress, reached her two days after 
the Treasury Department froze a $43,000-account established to 
cover expenditures of the project. 
  The letter reads: Our prohibition policy toward Cuba harms 
us, and it harms the island much more. The letter calls for a 
strengthening of the ties of friendship and cooperation between 
the two countries. 
  According to Benjamin, Delluns said the U.S. media welcomed 
the recent lifting of the restrictions on travel to and trading 
with Vietnam, and she called for the adoption of similar actions 
regarding Cuba. 
  The letter reads: We are definitely engaged in a post-Cold 
War struggle, and we support our old enemies now, as in the case 
of Russia. 
  Delluns views the Freedom to Travel Movement's 90-mile trip 
to Cuba as an act of courage. The trip, she said, is a 
manifestation of the desire of the two nations (Cuban and the 
United States) to establish communication and to learn from each 
other.

  [Text] Havana, 24 Jun (PL) -- Canada today invited Cuba to 
participate in a multinational counternarcotics training 
program, as part of the joint efforts against that scourge. 
  Canadian Ambassador Mark Entwistle made the announcement, 
indicating that "drug consumption is an international problem 
that can only be solved through international action and 
coordination." 
  The diplomat said that on Sunday, 26 June, the international 
day against drug consumption will be commemorated. He 
emphasized that his country's sponsorship of the training 
program shows Canada's commitment to the war against drug 
trafficking. 
  According to a note obtained by PRENSA LATINA, the 
counternarcotics agencies of 17 other Latin American and Asian 
nations have also been invited to participate in the course, 
which will be held in the Atlantic Province of New Brunswick 
during two weeks in August. 
  The invitation was made three days after Christine Stewart, 
minister of state for Latin America and Africa, ended a working 
visit to the island. Her visit was described as highly 
constructive by both sides. 
  Precisely on Monday, Ottawa resumed official economic aid to 
Cuba, in line with the plans of the government of Prime Minister 
Jean Chretien to maintain a foreign policy that is more 
independent of the United States and with greater rapprochement 
toward Latin America. 
  According to the training schedule, in the first week there 
will be classes and workshops on the counternarcotics methods 
and procedures used in Canada and in the following week, the 
participants will visit specialized counternarcotics units in 
several Canadian locations.

  [Text] Havana, 25 Jun (PL) -- Today, Cuban and Canadian 
companies announced their decision to establish a joint 
enterprise to extract, refine, and market nickel and cobalt on 
an international scale. This major agreement was signed by the 
General Nickel Co., Inc., owner of the shares of the nickel and 
cobalt production plant in Moa Bay in eastern Cuba, and by 
Canada's Sherritt Inc. 
  The basic agreement confirms the intention to establish a 
jointly-owned enterprise backed by the Cuban Government. This 
joint enterprise is considered one of the best operations 
worldwide for the production of nickel and cobalt, the two 
parties indicated in a joint news release issued today. 
  Everyone knows that Cuba has one of the world's largest 
reserves of nickel and cobalt and that it conducts preliminary 
processing of these metals at an installation in Moa Bay. 
  Sherritt Inc. is already getting a large part of the 
production of nickel and cobalt sulfides extracted from Moa Bay 
to use as raw materials at its refinery in Ft. Saskatchewan, 
Alberta. Under the agreement, the plant in Moa Bay, as well as 
the above-mentioned refinery, will be included as assets of the 
joint enterprise. The news release signed by the two companies 
adds that a corporation to market the products will be included 
in the assets. 
  The Cuban state will grant mining concessions to the joint 
enterprise. These rights will include more than 60 million tons 
of nickel marsh ore -- with an 80 percent of the reserves 
classified as confirmed reserves -- and will guarantee the 
operation of the plant in Moa Bay for 25 years. 
  The news release says there are concessions available for 
more than 15,000 hectares with additional reserves to maintain 
production in Moa Bay for 25 additional years. 
  This major operation thereby links Cuban reserves with the 
plant in Moa Bay and the Canadian refinery, and it will enable 
the joint enterprise to begin a broad effort to expand the 
installations located in eastern Cuba. 
  Basic Industry Minister Marcos Portal stressed that his 
country holds in high esteem the relation established with 
Sherritt Inc. in the production of nickel and cobalt, as well as 
in oil and gas -- areas in which cooperation is under way. 
  The Cuban Government believes that the expansion of our 
relations will result in a commercial activity that will 
strengthen Cuba's position within the international industrial 
community, Portal added. 
  Ian W. Delaney, Sherritt's president and director, said his 
company is pleased with the new enterprise because Cuban and 
Canadian installations are compatible and because Cuban reserves 
of nickel and cobalt are abundant. 
  Our previous relations with Cuba have been very successful, 
and we believe that our new association will lay the foundations 
for a new type of business in Cuba, he asserted. 
  The conclusion of the new agreement, the news release 
stressed, will depend on a thorough examination and review of 
the plants, the signature of legal documents, and the necessary 
regulatory approvals.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report by Elsy Fors: "Front Row Witness in the </F>
Caribbean's Integration"] 
  [Text] [no dateline as received] -- The Association of 
Caribbean States [AEC], to be commenced in Bridgetown, Barbados, 
on 4 July, will include the Cuban Chamber of Commerce as a front 
row witness and as an exceptional participant to consolidate the 
market closest to the island. According to AEC President Carlos 
Martinez Salsamendi, this will be Cuba's door to its 
incorporation into the international economy. 
  During an interview with PRENSA LATINA, the official 
underlined the Caribbean market's importance for his country, 
which enjoys comparative advantages in the subregion in the 
fields of industrial development, health, and even tourism. He 
said that Cuba exports cement, salt, construction materials, and 
technical services of various types to the Caribbean. With the 
incorporation of Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela into the AEC, 
Cuba will be able to export oil, minerals, raw materials, and 
commercial services to these countries also. From Guyana, Cuba 
buys minerals and lumber. 
  Salsamendi said that five years ago the 13 Caribbean Common 
Market [Caricom] countries regarded Cuba as a potential 
competitor in tourism and for supplies of some traditional 
Caribbean exports. Cuba is now considered a complementary 
economy, even regarding tourism. There are travel packages that 
include Jamaica and Cuba, as well as Mexico and Cuba in the same 
packages. In addition, air and sea travel agreements have been 
established to improve tourism development in the area. This 
improved relationship includes a growing interest in Caribbean 
business meetings and the Caribbean Exposition, which have been 
held since 1993 and 1992, respectively. These events are 
sponsored by the Chamber of Commerce. 
  This year, the events will precede the signing of the AEC 
Charter by the heads of government. The second meeting of 
Caribbean businessmen will be held in Santiago de Cuba on 27 and 
28 June. Expocaribe '94 will be held in this same city in Cuba's 
eastern region from 28 June to 3 July. 
  In the 1993 exposition, Expocaribe gathered 11 companies 
from 
nine countries. Presently, 15 countries and 32 firms have been 
registered for this year's exposition, the Chamber of Commerce 
president has reported. 
  The exposition grounds are small and, consequently, we have 
had to keep the number of participants low, Salsamendi said. 
Cuba will be represented by 195 enterprises, all of them 
established in the five easternmost provinces of the island. 
These provinces are destined to lead in trade and relations 
with Cuba's southern neighbors. 
  Representatives from outside of the region, including 
executives from Canada, France, and Spain, have also confirmed 
their participation in the businessmen's meeting. The meeting 
will include a discussion of Cuba's commercial policy toward the 
Caribbean. There will also be a discussion of business 
opportunities in each of the five eastern provinces of Cuba. 
For this discussion, a catalog has been prepared showing the 
idle industrial potential of this region of the island. 
  Local industrial potential includes the poligraphic 
industry, 
and nickel, copper, chromium, iron, and manganese mining. There 
is an abundance of reserves of these minerals in Cuba's eastern 
region. 
  The meeting will also discuss the Cuban economy and its 
prospects, as well as the possibilities for foreign investments 
in the country. Salsamendi explained that the new opening to 
foreign capital has brought to the Chamber of Commerce host 
province increasing activities. Because of these increasing 
activities, the Chamber of Commerce will have to open two 
subsidiary sites this year. One of these sites will be in 
Santiago de Cuba and the other will be in Matanzas. 
  All commercial delegations and investors go through the 
Chamber of Commerce. So far this year, the number of foreign 
businessmen who have dealt with the Chamber of Commerce exceeds 
the number of foreign businessmen who did business with the 
Chamber of Commerce in 1993. This year, the Chamber has handled 
the creation of one combined enterprise or economic association 
every week, which is twice the amount of last year. 
  According to the Chamber of Commerce president, foreign 
capital investments have been increasing, not only in oil 
prospecting and exploitation -- a sector in which Total of 
France, Sherrit of Canada, and Taurus of Sweden, among others, 
with their Cuban counterpart Cupet, participate -- but also in 
the nickel industry, by Inco of Canada; in cement, by Cemex of 
Mexico; and in the telephone industry, by Domos International. 
In the area of cosmetics and perfumes, the most recent 
association agreement was signed with Unilever of Great Britain, 
one of the world's leading companies in this industry. 
  According to Salsamendi, Cuba conducts its trade according 
to 
market economy rules after three decades of operating with a 
long-term system of commercial agreements and equitable prices, 
which was used in the old Socialist field. 
  He said that Cuba is not yet prepared, but it is learning to 
negotiate without maladjustments, and it is maintaining the 
social equity principle.

<F P=106> [Report by Clemente Nicado] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 24 Jun (PL) -- According to Foreign Ministry 
specialist Omar Morales, the spirit of agreement among the 
various Latin American integration mechanisms was reiterated in 
the preparations for the creation of the Association of 
Caribbean States [AEC]. 
  In a statement to PRENSA LATINA, Morales said the 
integrationist trend was evinced during recent meetings held by 
the Latin American Economic System and at the Ibero-American 
Summit. 
  The spirit is very healthy for the hemisphere -- Morales 
said 
-- because it opens the path toward the continent's economic 
unity, which will put the area in a better position to compete 
with blocs in other areas of the world. 
  Morales said the AEC is made up of three regional blocs, the 
Anglo-Caribbean Community (Caricom), the Central American 
Integration System (SICA), and the Group of Three, made up of 
Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia. 
  We hope this integrationist trend to link all regional blocs 
on the continent, including Mercosur [Common Market of the 
South] (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay) and the Andean 
Pact (Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Colombia), will 
continue, he added. 
  Morales said he will attend a technical meeting in Caracas 
on 
27 and 28 June to complete the future organization's charter. 
In addition, he said, we will continue to work on new subjects, 
like the AEC's working agenda and formulas for the secretariat's 
structure and operation. 
  He confirmed that a foreign ministers meeting will be held 
on 
29 June in Caracas, where the charter will be approved and the 
date and place for the definitive creation of the AEC will be 
established. 
  So far, Bridgetown, the capital of Barbados, is scheduled to 
begin receiving on 4 July heads of state of member countries to 
form the AEC, which is regarded as an intergovernmental 
organization for regional consensus, consultation, and 
cooperation.

<F P=106> [Report by Javier Rodriguez] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 24 Jun (PL) -- France and Cuba have 
discussed the possibility of France extending Cuba's line of 
credit to $150 million. French Ambassador Jean-Raphael Dufour 
confirmed the report for PRENSA LATINA today, saying that this 
credit stands at $120 million and that he is satisfied with the 
positive evolution of relations between the two countries. 
  During an interview with PRENSA LATINA, the ambassador said 
the first part of the 30-million-franc donation (in excess of $6 
million) to Cuba for use in basic industries is practically 
complete. 
  Dufour mentioned a French corporation's drilling for oil in 
Cuban offshore waters, particularly the first well drilled in 
Cardenas Bay, as one interesting aspect in the field of 
bilateral cooperation. 
  He said that French businessmen constantly travel to Cuba, 
and some of them are interested in the banking and sugar sectors. 
  A new working session of French businessmen and Cuban 
authorities will be held in the next few months as a 
continuation of the general negotiations held at the beginning 
of the year, when a large group of French businessmen came to 
Havana. 
  The ambassador described as very important a July meeting in 
Cuba of more than 600 French language professors from Latin 
America, Europe, and Africa to discuss the teaching of this 
language in Spanish-speaking countries. 
  He added that this event is endorsed by Cuban authorities 
and 
the University of Havana and that several Latin American 
countries will be well represented. Brazil and Argentina will 
send some 90 delegates. 
  We make realistic progress in developing ties with Cuba. We 
think it is the best way to develop those ties, Ambassador 
Dufour concluded.

  [Text] Ankara, 21 Jun (PL) -- It was reported today that 
Turkey and Cuba have assessed the possibility of increasing 
economic ties, especially in the areas of commerce, tourism, and 
business. 
  Those possibilities were studied during Cuban Ambassador to 
Turkey Jorge Castro's visit to the city of Izmir, an important 
agricultural and industrial center in Turkey, where he met with 
local authorities and industrial and commercial representatives. 
  The report given by Cuba's diplomatic office added that they 
had agreed to hold a meeting of Turkish and Cuban businessmen 
shortly to determine Cuba's participation in the construction of 
houses in that city. 
  Jorge Castro's two-day visit allowed him to discuss, in a 
friendly atmosphere, the development of bilateral economic ties 
and tourism investment and to give Izmir Mayor Burhan Dapatura a 
message from his Cuban counterpart, Pedro Chavez.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report by Mary Simon] </F>
  [Text] Geneva -- The UN Development Program (UNDP) has 
proposed a complete renovation of aid to further growth through 
the reduction of military expenses. The proposal is based on the 
fact the post Cold War period has not favored the financing of 
programs to protect humanity. 
  Although the 1994 UNDP Human Development Report assesses 
that 
military expenses in industrialized countries were reduced 3.6 
percent between 1987 and 1991, it considers the so-called peace 
dividends, which totaled approximately $935 billion, were not 
used to finance social development programs or to give security 
to the human race itself. 
  In its preceding report, the one for 1993, the UNDP had 
stressed the differences that existed in Mexico between the 
people in Chiapas State and those in the richest areas of the 
country. On that occasion, it somewhat sounded an alert to the 
situation and forecast the social explosion that occurred when 
Mayan peasants revolted against the state administration and the 
Mexican Government seven months later, on 1 January 1994. 
  After confirming its prediction that large gaps in human 
development can lead to civil conflict, the 1994 document 
asserts the Chiapas experience constitutes a disquieting 
reaction. 
<H5>  Human security </H5>
  The UNDP urges giving much more importance to human security 
than to hackneyed national security, on which the developed 
world spent approximately $815 billion in 1992. Developed 
countries used $125 billion in this sector, but those funds were 
almost all drawn from resources assigned to social programs at a 
human cost of vast, fatal consequences. 
  By proposing a type of alert system to forecast cases of 
national disintegration, such as Somalia, the report expresses 
doubt that all the resources assigned to military spending have 
increased security for the average citizen of the world. 
  In developing countries, the probabilities of dying from 
social abandonment, malnutrition, and preventable sicknesses are 
33 percent higher than the those of dying in a war caused by 
foreign aggression. 
  The relation between those expenses and the social costs in 
the GNP can be appraised by the fact that 1 billion people never 
see a health professional, more than 2 million children die of 
preventable, contagious diseases, with another 192 million 
facing malnutrition, and that 1.3 billion additional people 
suffer the effects of not having available drinking water. 
  Furthermore, 900 million citizens of those countries do not 
know how to read or write; 30 million children do not attend 
grade school, and, regarding the population cost, almost another 
3 billion people live in countries where yearly demographic 
growth exceeds 2 percent. 
  The United States spends an average of $290 billion in 
defense every year, while crime within its borders costs $425 
million, as well as many lives. The UNDP believes the situation 
is bad for white people but much worse for blacks. 
  According to this organization, one-third of white people 
live in areas contaminated by carbon monoxide, but the 
proportion is close to 50 percent for blacks, and the 
unemployment rate for blacks is double that for whites. 
  Indicating that human insecurity is a universal problem, the 
UNDP stresses the fact that poor countries are much more 
concerned about hunger and sicknesses, while the rich ones are 
kept awake by drugs and crime. 
  Approximately $460 billion could be obtained to perk peace 
during the period of 1995 to 2000 if military expenses 
throughout the world are decreased 3 percent a year, but there 
has to be a guarantee those resources will actually end up as 
funds to further development. 
<H5>  A New Criterion for Cooperation </H5>
  The formulation of a new criterion for cooperation, which 
ties reductions in military expense to a world pact favoring 
human development, is based on the need to find ways to share 
responsibilities. This implies new international agreements to 
replace those that the UNDP believes have an obsolete foreign 
aid criterion, so as to satisfy the new demands for human 
security, the focus of the organization's initiatives for 1994. 
According to this concept, the industrialized countries would 
pay for specific benefits, and the developing countries would 
also be obligated to reform their economies and government 
policies. Such ideas, akin to the new perspective that emerged 
from the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Summit 
held in Cartagena de Indias in 1992, address the issue of this 
new association for development. 
  The UNDP recognizes, however, that the manner in which aid 
is 
currently assigned still bears the scars of the so-called Cold 
War, when aid was reserved for strategic allies more frequently 
than it was assigned to truly poor countries. 
  A brief overview of the traditional handling of this type of 
aid also reflects varied concepts of implementation. Thus, 
while Egypt receives official aid from donor countries that 
amounts to approximately $280 per poor person, India receives 
only $7. Only 7-percent of aid given from government to 
government is assigned to human priorities such as basic 
education, elementary health attention, and water supply in 
rural areas, among others mentioned in the report. 
  The proposed UNDP pact establishes, generally, that poor 
countries as well as the rich ones promise to help satisfy the 
basic needs previously enumerated. The focus of the UNDP 
initiative is based on a multidimensional vision of 
developmental cooperation, a concept used in the past only to 
define foreign aid. 
  According to the viewpoint which the report endorses, 
northern and southern countries are intrinsically linked by 
other cultural, political, and economic factors. It is a fact, 
it states, that North-South aid is usually only a small part of 
other types of international financial flows. 
  Foreign aid to developing countries totaled $60 billion in 
1992, but the flow of private capital to the South increased to 
$102 billion that same year and had amounted to only $5 billion 
in 1990. What is more significant, however, is that 
three-fourths of that capital only goes to a dozen countries. 
They are, in decreasing order: China, Mexico, Malaysia, 
Argentina, Thailand, Indonesia, Brazil, Nigeria, Venezuela, and 
Korea. Only 6 percent is designated for sub-Saharan Africa and 
2 percent for less developed countries. 
  The UNDP proposal includes the concepts of an international 
system for minimum social security, compensation systems, and 
international institutions. 
  The first system will be financed with a world revenue tax 
of 
approximately 0.1 percent, which will yield $20 billion a year, 
to be imposed on countries with a per capita GNP of more than 
$10,000, to the benefit of, the UNDP believes, those countries 
that register a per capita GNP of less than $1,000. If this 
mechanism is not approved, the UNDP suggests the alternative 
option: that the current Official Aid for Development reserve an 
amount equivalent to 0.1 percent of the GNP for the poorer 
countries. 
  Regarding compensation, the UNDP is studying ways to form 
new 
associations between the rich and the poor. For example, the 
first could pay the poor for the destruction of nuclear weapons, 
the struggle against contagious diseases, the elimination of 
drugs, and the improvement of the planet's environment. The 
UNDP also suggests the future International Commerce 
Organization (OMC) establish a compensation program to be used 
when a country causes damage to others. 
  Finally, this new form of cooperation must be equipped with 
new organizations in the UN system. Thus, an Economic Security 
Council, a World Central Bank, an International Investments 
Fund, the future OMC, and a World Antimonopoly Directorate 
should be created. All those proposals will be broached at the 
World Conference on Human Development scheduled for 1995.

  [Text] Havana, 24 Jun (PL) -- Members of the diplomatic 
corps accredited in Cuba today had an overall view of a major 
military education facility when they visited Granma Naval 
Academy in response to an official invitation. 
  Diplomatic delegation heads, military attaches, and other 
officials of the diplomatic corps accredited in the country were 
accompanied by Deputy Foreign Relations Minister Nicolas 
Rodriguez, who has firsthand knowledge of the school which 
trains officers for Cuba's Navy, merchant marine, and fishing 
boats. 
  Following their welcome in the form of a brief military 
parade, the diplomats took a two and one-half hour tour to 
observe the details of projects required of the hundreds of 
specialists who graduate from the academy. The projects are 
related to the country's defense and other activities linked to 
national economic development 
  The academy, located in Bauta Municipality, Havana Province, 
educates military science graduates; experts on mines, 
torpedoes, complex artillery missile systems, radio 
communications, and power installations; navigation officers; 
and naval science graduates. 
  Hundreds of youths are tested annually before registration 
at 
the academy, which graduated 200 students during the last school 
year and which organizes the country's maritime manning tables, 
among other duties. 
  In keeping with the Cuban Foreign Ministry's policy of 
promoting contact between accredited diplomats and the many 
domestic sectors, the foreign officials visited classrooms, 
talked with recruits and officers, and had access to modern 
weapons displays. 
  The domestic and foreign reporters accompanying the 
diplomats 
also witnessed peculiar events, such as the curiosity exhibited 
by Joseph Gerard Sullivan, chief of the U.S. Interests section 
in Cuba, about sophisticated equipment used to camouflage 
submarine units. 
  At the end of the tour, the visitors were able to closely 
observe the NIG 14 antisubmarine helicopter and the installation 
of a powerful land-sea rocket launcher, which, in addition to 
being part of the academy students' curriculum, are defense 
instruments used by the Cuban naval forces.

  [Text] Havana, 25 Jun (PL) -- Ricardo Alarcon, president of 
the National Assembly of the People's Government, said today 
that the certainty that Cuba is capable of surmounting the 
adverse economic situation resulting from the loss of its 
commercial allies is becoming more accepted throughout the world 
all the time. 
  In a speech delivered in the western province of Matanzas, 
some 100 km east of the capital, Alarcon pointed out that this 
fact is increasing the anger of the enemies of the revolution 
that first arose in 1959. 
  The legislative leader said that in spite of the tightening 
of the blockade imposed on the island by the United States over 
three decades ago, a growing number of foreign investors are 
interested in establishing joint enterprises with Cuba. 
  According to a report by the National Information Agency 
(AIN), every day more businessmen become interested in investing 
in our country, despite the blockade and U.S. hostility, Alarcon 
emphasized. 
  Alarcon also mentioned the Canadian Government's 
announcement 
this week that it would resume official assistance to the 
country. 
  Cuba has been experiencing an adverse economic situation 
since the disappearance of the European socialist bloc led by 
the former USSR, with which Cuba conducted 85 percent of its 
trade.

  [Text] Yesterday, the Paraguayan, Bolivian, and Uruguayan 
foreign ministers relaunched Urupabol [Permanent Joint 
Commission of Uruguay, Paraguay, and Bolivia] -- 12 years after 
it disappeared -- as a way to strengthen the physical 
integration of the three countries. 
  After two days of meetings, at 1230 yesterday, Paraguayan 
Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner, Bolivian Foreign 
Minister Antonio Aranibar Quiroga, and Uruguayan Foreign 
Minister Sergio Abreu Bonilla signed a joint declaration at the 
Foreign Ministry in Asuncion. 
  The ministers asked that the Agreement for River 
Transportation through the Paraguay-Parana Waterway be ratified 
by all member countries as a way to strengthen physical 
integration. Argentina and Brazil have yet to ratify the 
document. Paraguay, Bolivia, and Uruguay have already ratified 
it. 
  In the joint declaration, the foreign ministers express the 
need for a more significant participation of companies from the 
three Urupabol member countries in the implementation of the 
various Paraguay-Parana Waterway projects. The ministers agree 
that NAFTA is an important step forward for the creation of a 
broadened economic space in the hemisphere. 
  Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu Bonilla stressed 
that 
the relaunching of Urupabol -- which disappeared in 1982 -- does 
not seek to upset the influence of Argentina and Brazil, the two 
powerful Mercosur [Common Market of the South] member countries. 
The idea is to complement and compare interests, Abreu said. 
  The Paraguayan and Bolivian foreign ministers said they were 
pleased with the Uruguayan offer to use Uruguayan port 
facilities to take their products to the Atlantic Ocean.

  [Text] The refloating of Urupabol [Permanent Joint 
Commission of Uruguay, Paraguay, and Bolivia], which disappeared 
in 1982, does not have as its purpose to become a counterbalance 
to Argentina and Brazil, the two powerful partners of Mercosur 
[Common Market of the South], Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio 
Abreu Bonilla said yesterday. "The essential thing is to 
develop the idea of Urupabol based on complementary interests 
and not on a confrontation between interests," he said. 
  While he admitted that Paraguay and Uruguay have to compete 
within Mercosur among common interests in a single market of 200 
million consumers, he added that this does not necessarily mean 
confrontation, as common interests and common positions among 
the four countries must be sought. 
  The Uruguayan foreign minister added: "What we must seek 
within Mercosur is a clearer and more definite integration, and 
especially a strict fulfillment of the obligations assumed by 
the (four) countries. This is true for the large ones 
(Argentina and Brazil), in particular, because they are our main 
markets. It is also true for the small ones, or those 
suffering the imbalances (Paraguay and Uruguay), both because of 
our exporting potential and also based on the importance that 
needs to be given to the obligations assumed." 
  Bolivia is part of the Andean Pact, and for this reason is 
not a member of Mercosur, as the Asuncion Treaty does not allow 
it. The Uruguayan foreign minister said, however, that 
bilateral agreements can be achieved with Bolivia through the 
Latin American Integration Association (ALADI) headquartered in 
Montevideo. He further explained that improved trade can be 
achieved through ALADI, as a way of explaining that there are no 
difficulties for Paraguay and Uruguay in exchanging products 
bilaterally with countries that are not members of Mercosur. 
  "The presence of Bolivia is very important, not only within 
the framework of cooperation, but essentially within the 
framework of trade -- only with the legal instruments we already 
have, and not with the legal structures that prevail in the 
Mercosur market," he said. 
  Abreu Bonilla said his country has offered Paraguay and 
Bolivia its port services for export of their products through 
the Atlantic Ocean, considering that both are landlocked 
countries.

<F P=106> [From the "NTV" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Eastern Army forces maintain full combat readiness 
to quickly and effectively repel any enemy attack. This was 
confirmed by Army commanders at the beginning of a tour that 
began in Guantanamo Province and will extend to Camaguey 
Province, with the participation of national media directors as 
guests. The visit had a definite goal: 
  [Begin unidentified commander recording] First of all, we 
want the comrades to learn about the work we do, the actions we 
carry out in the territory -- not only in the Army, but also in 
the territories of six provinces, where the Eastern Army is 
deployed. [end recording] 
  The five-point rating given by the Eastern Army commander to 
this infantry exercise and the satisfactory results achieved on 
the shooting range by Border Guard troops showed that the 
personnel's preparation has achieved even better results than 
last year. Equally magnificent were the efforts exerted to 
prepare the area of military operations, the implementation of 
techniques, the protection of weapons, tasks in which the 
Eastern Army maintains a vanguard position. 
  The Arturo Lince Gonzalez Agrarian and Livestock Enterprise 
in Sabanetas displayed the efforts carried out by local leaders 
to achieve food self sufficiency. It suffered losses last year, 
but it hopes to become feasible this year with higher 
production. We must not forget that the Eastern Army intends to 
double its food production, and finance almost a fifth of its 
budget. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified female speaker] I am quite 
pleased to verify that the FAR [Revolutionary Armed Forces] are 
very productive for the country; that it is an Army permanently 
involved in production activities for the country, thus setting 
an example of how to carry out production activities with 
controls, economic analyses, and efficiency. 
  [Unidentified male speaker] I have seen what the other 
Armies 
are doing,and I believe it will be a close tie because any of 
the three Armies can win. I, however, think there is a strong 
contingent -- the Eastern Army. [end recording] 
  The Eastern Army's commander said it is rightfully called 
the 
best FAR command, and others will have to work hard to win that 
title. 
  [Begin Division General Ramon Espinoza recording] The FAR 
will be the winner even if we lose our title. [end recording: 
  Guantanamo has proven that this is possible, meaning that 
the 
Eastern Army will again win the title of best FAR command.

<F P=106> [Report by Leonel Perez Moya from Guantanamo Province for </F>
the "Exclusive" program -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] The Eastern Army forces maintain their combat 
readiness to quickly and effectively repel any offensive action 
from the Yankee Marines posted at the Naval base in Guantanamo 
Bay. This statement was made today in the mountains by Division 
General Ramon Espinoza Martin, chief of the Eastern Army, upon 
concluding a tour of FAR [Revolutionary Armed Forces] military 
units and agrarian and livestock enterprises in Guantanamo 
Province. 
  Div. Gen. Espinoza remarked that increases in military 
personnel and combat measures have recently been observed in the 
U.S. military enclave, where maneuvers were carried out early 
this month and where there has been an increase in the arrival 
of ships and aircraft. 
  These movements may reflect preparations for a possible 
military invasion of Haiti. If this action takes place, it will 
worsen tensions in the Caribbean region, so FAR must be alert 
for any eventuality, Div. Gen. Espinoza said. 
  The visit began at the Antonio Maceo Border Guard Brigade, 
which is in charge of protecting the line of demarcation with 
the Yankee base. The visitors were able to observe the high 
morale that prevails among the fighters, who each day become 
more alert and prepared to reject any aggression.

    [Editorial Report] Havana Cuba Vision Network in Spanish at 
0033 GMT on 25 June carries a recording of President Fidel 
Castro's 16 June meeting with Colombian businessmen in Cartagena 
de Indias, Colombia, following the closure of the Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit. Castro is wearing a guayabera and is 
seated at a long table with various persons on either side, 
facing approximately 60 businessmen and officials who are 
attending the meeting. 
  President Castro begins the meeting with the following 
statement: "We are here full of hope for encouraging this 
fraternal, friendly spirit that has been created, the 
perspectives that have opened. The only thing I really deplore 
about this is that we are not the PRC instead of Cuba. Cuba is 
tiny; it is a small country, while the PRC is enormous, millions 
of square km, with a population of 1.2 billion. All the 
businessmen, industrialists, and investors want to go there, to 
the PRC. Cuba is small, but we can certainly do something in 
Cuba. We can fulfill a principle, above all -- to develop 
economic, friendship, cooperation, trade, and peace relations 
among nations. We can encourage economic and trade ties. 
  ``We are willing to cooperate based on one essential thing, 
seriousness. I can tell you that whatever can be done in Cuba 
will be done with absolute and total seriousness by us. Since 
this is the case, I am sure you want to know about many things. 
I will not tell you about the summit. The newspapers have 
already reported it. Perhaps we can appoint a moderator. Whom do 
we appoint governor? No, not governor, [chuckles] moderator. He 
must play the role of governor to act as moderator here.'' 
  Castro and those seated at the main table speak softly among 
themselves and decide who will be appointed to act as moderator. 
Castro is heard commenting: "He must have tremendous experience." 
  An unidentified moderator in the front row stands and begins 
by "cordially greeting" Castro "on behalf of the business 
community in Cartagena and the region;" adding that "the 
resumption of diplomatic and trade relations between Colombia 
and Cuba" led to "unusual intensive activity. In Cartagena de 
Indias' case, this was a result of the declaration of sisterhood 
signed between Santiago de Cuba and Cartagena de Indias." He 
adds: "The Cuban ambassador and his cultural and trade" attaches 
have already visited Cartagena de Indias and participated in "a 
series of meetings that have already shown various excellent 
perspectives" between this region and Cuba. 
  The moderator says the meeting is being attended by 
representatives of many business groups in the region -- large 
and small industries, hotels, stores, investment firms, 
fisheries, etc. -- and "they want to comment on the possibility 
of establishing trade with Cuba. They also have questions 
concerning issues they have already reviewed with the Cuban 
ambassador," including "the mechanisms that will be implemented 
to facilitate these relations." The moderator asks businessmen 
to stand up, identify themselves, and give the name of the 
company or activity they represent. 
  Miguel Parra stands up, introduces himself, and says he is 
"the owner of Milpa Investments, which operates coal mines in 
the central part of the country" and has "been doing business 
with the Cuban company MAPRINTER [Cuban Raw Materials and 
Intermediate Products Import Enterprise], a branch of the 
Foreign Trade Ministry, for the last two years. Within this time 
we have sent 23 shipments -- worth over $4 million -- of this 
product to Cuba, through the port of Barranquilla." Parra then 
mentions the medal he was given by the Cuban Government at the 
1992 international fair in Havana, in a ceremony that was 
personally attended by Castro. 
  Parra specifically asks "the Colombian people, 
industrialists, and businessmen to have faith in Cuba, to 
believe in Cuba, to pay little attention to international 
propaganda because, in our case and with the experience acquired 
in two and a half years, we have realized that what the 
international media shows is not reality. Cuba is a country with 
credibility; it is serious concerning its commitments, as the 
president has said. In fact, on three occasions, we shipped 
merchandise without a confirmed letter of credit. This does not 
mean Cuba does not have the money to pay because Cuba pays us 
when it pledges to buy something. Instead, due to the blockade 
we all repudiate, we have to go the long way around, through 
other countries, to legalize our operations in U.S. dollars; and 
this obviously delays the procedure. Today, in fact, we are 
sending a shipment of our product -- coke coal -- to Cuba and we 
are doing it without having received the letter of credit 
confirmed by the president. But I repeat, this does not mean you 
do not fulfill your pledges." 
  Castro says: "We can stay here as a guarantee." [laughter, 
applause] 
  Parra says he and Mayra Tomas, MAPRINTER official, already 
have plans to establish a port in Barranquilla that "will 
expedite coal shipments" and give priority to Cuban ships or any 
ships chartered in other countries, "to overcome the gap that 
has occurred in maritime transportation." He explains that 
Thomas has already managed to get various ships to send 
refractory bricks and other products to Cuba. He promises Castro 
that a port will legally operate in Barranquilla soon and that 
the facilities will be at his service so he may use them to ship 
all the Colombian products he wants to Cuba. 
  Castro says: "Thank you, thank you. [applause] Which Cuban 
industry is using this coal right now? The steel industry?" 
  Parra answers: "It is used to manufacture gas for domestic 
use; it is used in the steel industry, in foundries, to 
manufacture acetylene. It is specifically used by Minaz 
[Ministry of the Sugar Industry] industries...." 
  Castro interrupts: "And the metalworks industry and basic 
industry, particularly the one that manufactures gas for the 
population in an old plant we have over there." 
  The next speaker is Carlos Banegas, manager of Exclusive 
Minerals, who invites Colombian businessmen to buy Cuban 
products and explains that he is the local distributor of Cuban 
zeolite, which is used in the agriculture sector, "to 
manufacture fodder, soft drink filters, and beer filters." 
Speaking of trade with Cuba, he says his company has "imported 
3,000 tons of zeolite this year" and has plans to import 5,000 
tons by year end. Banegas says he is also the local 
representative for a new Cuban product, a vaccine to innoculate 
bovines against ticks. He said "protocol research has been 
conducted" and its sale should be approved in a month, when it 
will be available in the local market. Banegas adds that his 
company expects to initially sell "5 million doses of this 
vaccine in Colombia." 
  Banegas is followed by Freddy Lehner, manager of BIOLEHNER, 
local representative of the Genetic Engineering and 
Biotechnology Center's recombinant vaccine against hepatitis. 
  Castro turns to Banegas and asks: "What is yours?" 
  Banegas answers: "A vaccine against bovine ticks." 
  Castro adds: "Ah, yes, the vaccine against ticks. It is very 
important and yields good economic results." 
  Lehner says the Colombian Health Ministry has purchased "a 
large number of hepatitis B vaccine doses for a large-scale 
vaccination program" in the country; adding he is also the local 
representative for the Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology 
Center's (Eyverkinasa), which is a recombinant streptokinase 
used in case of a heart attack; (Evermin), which is an epidermic 
growth factor; and Interferon. 
  Castro states: "(Ateromixol) comes from another center. It 
is 
the famous PPG [expansion unknown]." 
  Lehner suggests that it be called (Ateromixol) in Colombia 
rather than PPG. 
  Castro replies: "Yes. Coincidentially, the name was 
arbitrarily invented when they were involved in its research. 
One day they went to register a product in Spain and discovered 
a product named PPG in Spain. Imagine, what a coincidence. So 
many letters, so many combinations; yet they could not register 
it as PPG, but it is known as PPG almost everywhere." 
  Lehner smiles and says: "I am always asked why the product 
is 
called PPG, but I still do not know." 
  Castro answers: "It was an arbitrary decision, yet people 
invent names for the PPG." 
  Lehner says his company is also the local representative for 
the Carlos J. Finlay Institute's meningococci vaccine, which was 
tested with "excellent" results in Antioquia, where 20,000 
children were inoculated with doses donated by the Cuban 
Government. 
  Castro says: "That vaccine is important because meningococci 
disease sows terror. It is not only a matter of how many 
children are saved, which is priceless, but the fear this 
disease instills in the family. It involves millions of people, 
parents, siblings, uncles, everyone. Whenever a person sees a 
child with fever or any symptom, he immediately thinks about the 
possibility of meningococci. We eradicated that scourge, that 
terror in our country precisely as a result of that vaccine. The 
use of this vaccine has expanded considerably; it is being sold 
in Argentine. Its sale is being discussed with the Brazilians 
and other countries. It is a product with many perspectives." 
  Lehner explains that the Colombian authorities are working 
hard to inoculate children in rural areas and poor sectors, 
adding that maningococci cases have been detected in 
Barranquilla, Buenaventura, Cali, and Cartagena de Indias, and 
every effort is being made so the people learn about this 
vaccine. 
  Castro states: "It is the only vaccine of its kind in the 
world. The same goes for the tick vaccine. It too is the only 
one of its kind. We have people working there, wracking their 
brains, to see how they can help the country counter its 
difficult situations. We have made important investments in the 
research sector. We are now completing the construction of a 
center that has already begun to produce monoclonal antibodies. 
These are tremendously important, not only for the diagnosis of 
diseases, but also for the struggle against cancer, where new 
theories and possibilities have appeared. 
  ``I think there is a possibility of finding a cancer 
vaccine, 
above all, one dealing with viruses. The goal is to find 
specific antibodies that directly attack malignant cells because 
the medicine available right now attacks all the cells and has 
damaging side effects. Nevertheless, I think the center we are 
completing right now has a possibility of doing this because it 
will be one of the leading centers, one of the best centers in 
the world. I am glad we were able to help. I am glad we were 
able to meet; it is a pleasure. I am proud that [words 
indistinct] symbolically representing [words indistinct]'' 
  An unidentified speaker asks about AIDS research in Cuba, 
to which Castro answers: "Yes, we are working on AIDS, too. 
Research began in the very beginning and we have achieved great 
success concerning AIDS. It is a terrible threat right now and 
apparently, it is very difficult to control because it is a 
mutant virus. A mutant virus is difficult because you may find 
the way to attack a specific type of virus -- for example the 
flu virus -- but if it mutates, it becomes another type of 
virus. [Words indistinct] using Interferon, an antiviral [words 
indistinct] from blood, and we have been using special measures 
to prevent its propagation because AIDS spreads like wildfire. 
Sometimes all it takes is one case to infect 30, 40, or 50 
persons. People have a mentality. Sometimes they ignore this, 
granted, but we know of cases in which people know they are 
infected, but do not care if others become infected. The 
situation concerning that disease is truly dramatic and everyone 
has a responsibility to work on AIDS, cancer, parasites, and 
virus research. 
  ``We are trying to find a multiple vaccine that immunizes a 
person against many diseases with a single dose. We are trying 
to do this through genetic engineering, which will perfect the 
vaccine. We now have the maningococci vaccine and the hepatitis 
vaccine through genetic engineering, just as we have the 
streptokinase through genetic engineering. Just see the 
difference between this and the natural product. Some people 
manufacture it from natural products, extracting the serum from 
people and all that, but what does a dose cost? $1,500. How much 
does a dose of streptokinase cost? More than $300 -- I do not 
know what the current price is, but the cost is five times less 
when the same medicine is a result of genetic engineering. 
  ``I am taking this opportunity to tell you that part of the 
medicine we currently export to Colombia is destined to pay some 
old debts that are still pending. We intend to honor our 
commitments and pay some debts this way. I believe the 
possibilities are many because you have a large population -- 30 
million, or more than 30 million.'' 
  The moderator says: "33 million." 
  Castro exclaims: "How you have grown! You were half that 
many 
a few years ago. You also have different climates -- tropical, 
temperate -- and yours is one of the countries most concerned 
about people's health. Let me tell you, the recent Colombian 
Governments have been most concerned about health programs." 
  The last speaker is Rizo, president of the Cartagena de 
Indias Chamber of Commerce, who has reviewed Cuba's progress in 
the technology, science, and engineering sectors. Colombia has 
achieved various degrees of development, which entails various 
degrees of technology. Rizo says he "believes an enormous 
exchange of technology could occur between Cuba and Colombia in 
this concern," and he would like to exchange information with 
Cuban professionals, engineers, and consultation firms. This 
would enable them to carry out excellent work, both in Cuba and 
Colombia because "if there is something Cuba has done, it has 
been to improve the quality of people's lives. We still have a 
lot of people whose quality of life must be improved, and 
advanced technology is too expensive for them." 
  Castro asks: "Does this include low-cost housing?" 
  Rizo answers: "Yes, Sir." 
  Castro emphasizes: "You must work hard to find solutions, to 
build low-cost houses, as we call them." 
  Rizo says this also includes sewers, aqueducts, 
communication, roads, and all the services needed for a better 
lifestyle. 
  The meeting ends with Castro's statement: "I wanted to tell 
you I feel very satisfied about this meeting with you. The 
Fourth Ibero-American Summit has just been held. Its main goal 
was integration, and we are specifically working on issues 
dealing with our two countries' integration. We have achieved 
progress and who knows how far we can go -- until one day we are 
fully integrated. We should strive to be fully integrated, and 
we must first do it with our neighbors. As I said, the flight 
from Havana to Santiago in a turbo- prop aircraft takes 
practically as long as the trip from Havana to Cartagena de 
Indias in a jet aircraft. I was astonished by this. I had not 
realized this even though I was here recently. This time, I sat 
down, read some papers, and chatted for awhile, and suddenly we 
were landing here. The communications revolution has brought us 
closer. 
  We are very similar; at least we are quite similar to the 
people in Cartagena de Indias, perhaps because we live in a 
warmer, more tropical climate. Maybe the people in Santa Fe de 
Bogota are not so communicative because they live on a plateau 
and it is colder over there. It is colder there, and I am told 
the city has grown so much and there is so much cement that it 
is now like Mexico City, where the average temperature has 
increased. We are very much alike however, and it is a truly 
promising step to discover there are so many possibilities for 
getting closer, working together, developing the economy 
together. 
  ``Once again, we have reason to dream what our liberators 
dreamed of -- that one day our Latin American nations would be 
united, a strong united front. We speak the same language, have 
the same culture, and we can speak here without translators. We 
know we can talk, while it is difficult to do this in the world 
today if you do not speak another language. If we have no other 
choice but to learn English, then we will learn English. In the 
end, it is not our fault that the English were great colonizers 
and spread the language throughout Asia, Africa, Canada, and 
other places. We will do this to speak with the others, with 
outsiders, but we only need to speak Spanish among ourselves -- 
except for one or two words that have different meanings here 
and there. It is a language in which we can perfectly well 
understand one another. What an advantage this is for becoming 
closer; what an advantage for us to unite; what an advantage for 
becoming a union someday. When I have a meeting like this, I 
believe more than ever in the things I have always believed in. 
Thank you.'' [applause]

  [Text] Havana, 27 Jun (EFE) -- Today, official sources 
reported that on Sunday [26 June], two Cuban citizens left the 
Belgian ambassador's residence in Havana. Sixty-nine of a total 
of 124 persons who jumped over the fence of the residence to 
obtain political asylum on 28 May remain at the diplomatic 
mission. 
  Since then, a total of 55 persons, among them several women 
and children, have left the diplomatic mission, accepting the 
guarantees offered by the Cuban authorities that they will not 
be subject to legal proceedings for entering the embassy. 
  A week ago, the Cuban Government announced it will not 
authorize the departure from the country of any Cuban who 
forcibly enters a diplomatic mission. A total of 21 persons 
remain at the German Embassy in Havana, while the eight 
occupants of the Chilean Consulate General left the mission last 
week.

Review"] 
  [Text] Cuba and the UN Population Fund signed two 
agreements aimed at carrying out research on the territorial 
distribution of the population and the dissemination of 
information regarding the various forms of contraception 
available to the Cuban population. 
  The ceremony is linked to the activities that will be 
conducted in Cuba on the occasion of world population day on 11 
July. Both programs will receive a contribution of almost 
$730,000 from the UN Population Fund and almost 2 million pesos 
from the Cuban Government. It is part of the cooperation 
program, which the UN Population Fund maintains with the island, 
which in the last four years has reached $4 million. (Reiner 
Rosembaum), the UN Population Fund's director for Mexico, 
Bolivia, and Cuba, told us the following: 
  [Begin (Rosembaum) recording] I am very pleased to be able 
to 
practically initiate my work in Cuba with such a significant 
ceremony. Not only is it a great incentive for me, but with 
this program, we are in a position to fulfill the mandate of the 
UN Population Fund here in Cuba. We are also going to be able 
to meet the financial ceiling assigned to this country. [end 
recording] 
  One of the programs includes research work in rural areas in 
order to propose a coherent population distribution policy that 
can promote the stability of the population and its link to the 
social, economic, and environmental development of its 
surroundings. The object is also to seek new forms of 
territorial planning based on a greater and more efficient 
participation of citizens and institutions. This program will 
be carried out by the Physical Planning Institute of the Economy 
and Planning Ministry. 
  The other program is aimed at providing the largest amount 
of 
information to women and men of reproductive age about the 
various forms of contraceptive methods and family planning, 
which the country has available for its citizens. Among the 
purposes of this program is to voluntarily decrease the number 
of unwanted pregnancies and the dangers they present for women, 
especially for those under the age of 20. This program will be 
carried out by the National Sex Education Center linked to the 
National Assembly of the People's Government, the Public Health 
Ministry, and the Federation of Cuban Women.

  [Text] Esteban Lazo, vice president of the Council of 
State, gave the opening address at the second meeting of 
Caribbean businessmen in Santiago de Cuba. Lazo stated that the 
main objective of this meeting is to contribute to increasing 
the level of economic and commercial relations with Caribbean 
area countries. 
  [Begin recording] [Lazo] We want to sell more in the 
Caribbean; we want to buy more in the Caribbean. We want to 
increase the presence of joint enterprises with Caribbean 
companies. We hope, above all, that these meetings can be the 
occasion and the place not only for Cuba's trade with the 
Caribbean, but for Cuba as a center of Caribbean trade, thus 
allowing us to convert Cuba, its eastern region, and Santiago de 
Cuba into a center from which we Caribbeans can trade and 
negotiate with the rest of the world. [end recording] 
  In his address, Michael Manley, Jamaica's former prime 
minister, condemned the U.S. blockade of Cuba: 
  [Begin Manley recording in English, with simultaneous 
translation into Spanish] I can say without hesitation that the 
embargo begins with injustice. I can go further in saying that 
it is contrary to international law. I go even further, in my 
statement that it is now maintained in defiance of the 
overwhelming UN vote. [end recording] 
  In another part of his address, Manley stated that history 
would be made with the creation of the Association of Caribbean 
States, which will come to life with Cuba's presence. 
  Other addresses during the course of the morning were 
delivered by Osvaldo Martinez, president of the economic 
commission of the National Assembly of the People's Government 
and director of the World Economic Research Center, and by 
Octavio Castilla, vice minister of foreign investments and 
economic cooperation.

<F P=106> [From the "Evening Information Review" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The 200 North Americans who are visiting Havana in 
defiance of their country's laws have announced new trips to the 
island at the end of the year and in 1995 to pressure President 
William Clinton to lift that prohibition. In a news conference, 
the activists of the U.S. Freedom To Travel movement said that 
in the Clinton administration and Congress, there are those who 
support an end to the prohibition on visits to Cuba. They 
indicated that hundreds of people backed the bill and that in 
only one week, they collected $25,000 to make the trip after the 
Treasury Department's decision to freeze $43,000 of the 
organization's bank account. They emphasized that Freedom To 
Travel is composed of 50 organizations from 25 states and is 
committed to ending the restrictions on visiting Cuba and 
lifting the economic blockade. 
  The group, which will stay on the island until 30 June, 
plans 
to visit sites of historic and social interest and meet with 
Cuban officials. 
  We hope that the Freedom To Travel group will achieve its 
objective of changing the unjust laws with which the U.S. 
Government seeks to prevent visits by U.S. citizens to Cuba, 
Medea Benjamin, executive director of the Global Exchange 
Project, said in Havana. In remarks to this station, the 
spokesperson of the group said this second defiant action is 
greater than the first and that something very important has 
been achieved in recent months: a Congressional resolution that 
stipulates that the president cannot restrict the U.S. citizens' 
rights to travel. Medea Benjamin added that through these trips, 
the members of the group can confirm the Cuban people's 
affection and verify how irrational and unjust the U.S. policy 
against Cuba is. 
  Last year, the Freedom To Travel group made its first visit 
to the island, and, when it returned to the United States, many 
of its members experienced coercive measures, such as having 
their passports withheld and their bank accounts frozen and even 
being threatened with imprisonment.

<F P=106> [Interview with Idalberto Acuna, president of the People's </F>
Assemblies in Centro Havana Municipality, by Gisela Bel Heredia 
for the "Exclusive" program --live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Bel Heredia] I am here with Comrade Idalberto 
Acuna, president of the People's Assemblies in Centro Habana 
Municipality. Idalberto, we would like you to explain the 
progress report process and its results in the municipality you 
represent. 
  [Acuna] Well, the progress report meetings began in mid-May 
in our municipality. We had scheduled 308 meetings, but I 
believe the most significant thing is not the number of meetings 
or the fact that a program was carried out, which I can readily 
say has been carried out according to schedule. I believe the 
most interesting thing in this progress report process is the 
people's participation. They have always participated but, based 
on the guidance received from the National Assembly of the 
People's Government [ANPP] in connection with deputies, ANPP 
province delegates, administrative officials, chiefs of 
distribution centers, officials in the service, gastronomy, and 
trade sectors, everyone who is part of the great ANPP system 
actively participated. 
  [Bel Heredia] Idalberto, referring to the main proposals and 
the main topics analyzed at the meetings that were held in the 
different districts and groups, what areas did they mainly deal 
with? 
  [Acuna] The same ones that are definitely more important 
nowadays -- electricity, gas, aqueducts. There is something I 
want to clarify, however. They have dealt with issues that were 
already discussed in other assemblies; for example, products 
missing from warehouses. This was not a significant issue, and 
we think we have yet to receive a report on this. That is 
definitely an achievement and we have made sure that people get 
their supplies, to prevent the type of problems that previously 
occurred. 
  We have received some proposals concerning the gastronomy 
sector, mainly dealing with the distribution of hamburgers, 
pizzas, and other products. We have reviewed innumerable 
formulas to see which ones are definitely more acceptable. 
  [Bel Heredia] Idalberto, if you had to make an assessment of 
the process that is about to conclude, what would you say about 
Centro Habana? 
  [Acuna] We think it has been a superior progress report 
process. It has been superior because we have even ascertained 
the support given to the measures recently implemented in the 
country. In fact, it not only deals with the measures that have 
already been implemented; it also involves all the work carried 
out in each district, which is confirmed by the documents sent 
to the ANPP. They prove that the support has been absolute.

  [Text] As of 1 July, the Ministry of Prices and Finance, 
through the 23 June Resolution No. 8, will establish new prices 
for fuels that are sold for personal use through fuel ration 
cards. The prices, agreed upon by the executive committee of the 
Council of Ministers are: 1.20 pesos per liter for special 
gasoline; 1 peso per liter for regular gasoline; 75 cents per 
liter of gas oil or diesel. 
  The resolution establishes that the money will be collected 
when the private-use fuel ration cards are issued to consumers 
in the places designated by the enterprises that are authorized 
to operate the service centers. The fuel ration cards will be 
given out, in the same manner as before, according to Cuba's 
fuel supply. 
  The enterprises that will supply and charge for the fuel 
ration cards for private use will guarantee that they have no 
expiration date and that those not used by year end, for any 
reason, can be renewed during the period that the said 
enterprises establish. A private vehicle owner who has a 1994 
fuel ration card when the new prices become effective can renew 
them before 31 July 1994 in the same place where he got them. He 
will have to pay the difference between the old and new prices.

  [Text] On 27 June, TRABAJADORES newspaper published an 
editorial entitled "Administration is the Art of Mutual 
Cooperation for a Common Goal." If the administration is not 
efficient in this aspect, there is no chance of success, even 
with the proper resources, or even if there is a guaranteed 
demand for the product. Cuba is different from the majority of 
Latin American countries and thanks to wise, humanitarian 
policies, has a population with a high educational level. 
Nevertheless, for various reasons, including administrative 
errors, that enormous resource is seldom fulfilled today. 
  The editorial adds: These causes relate to the depressed 
state of our economy and the nonexistence or inadequate systemic 
structures within the administration of the enterprises. 
Although this does not justify administrative errors, it is true 
that the improper use of human potential in our work centers is 
in part due to what many call the spider web, a thick bundle of 
structures, mechanisms, formulas, and outdated regulations that 
deprive management of the autonomy, authority, and capacity for 
decision-making. 
  TRABAJADORES points out, however, that many of these 
administrators use this situation to evade responsibility for 
the results of their work and display very little initiative. 
Under today's difficult conditions, two very different attitudes 
are clearly observed among administrators -- those who justify 
themselves, and those who work. Those who do the justifying are 
experts at inventing excuses for their management problems -- I 
was not oriented, they did not comply. The economic efficiency 
assemblies, among other merits, classify the groups to which the 
administrators belong -- either to the group that is expert at 
excuses, or to that which struggles and strives to achieve 
respect within a collective that needs managers, not rehearsed 
excuses. 
  The editorial adds: When the workers do not have water to 
quench their thirst, when there are excess workers or when there 
are not enough workers for the needed production, when there is 
unused land that is not organized for self-sufficiency planting, 
the administrator is responsible. When the by-products of the 
primary production are not utilized or equipment is 
underutilized, fundamentally, the boss is responsible. Attention 
to man, in the broad sense of the concept, forms an essential 
part of the administrative function -- the ability to reach 
goals through the conscious cooperation of a collective of 
workers. All our administrators should understand that attention 
to man, communication with workers, and joint action does not 
depend on the amount of a material incentive because the human 
will is not merchandise. 
  The TRABAJADORES editorial adds: To win the will of the 
workers, practical, systematic, and daily action is needed to 
establish that the workers are the principle protagonists. They 
are the ones who possess the greatest reserve of economic and 
technological talent. They are the ones who can judge whether or 
not administrative management serves national economic interests 
and the workplace. 
  The editorial concludes that these analyses have come about 
in the efficiency assemblies and are not meant to distance 
administration from the workers, but rather, to unite them in a 
joint project.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon from the "Evening Information </F>
Review"] 
  [Text] The seminar on business opportunities in Cuba, 
sponsored in Havana this week by the British magazine THE 
ECONOMIST, revealed the great strides that have been made by the 
foreign investment process in Cuba's basic industry. 
  The basic industry sector includes eight [number as heard] 
branches: the production of oil, nickel, glass, paper and paste, 
as well as chemistry and mining geology, which have been offered 
to potential investors over the past few years for exploitation. 
  As a result of these negotiations, thus far, Cuba has signed 
26 contracts for mineral exploration and exploitation, two for 
administrative functions, one for the exploitation of copper in 
Pinar del Rio Province, and two partnerships have been 
established to conduct feasibility studies of gold, lead, and 
zinc deposits. 
  These agreements, which cover 50 percent of the area up for 
bid, include work over an area of approximately 40,000 square km 
of national territory; they do not include agreements for the 
exploration and extraction of oil. This is another branch of 
the basic industry that has made serious progress in the field 
of partnerships between the state-owned Cuba Petroleum and 
foreign firms. 
  Regarding oil exploration, 16 of the 33 high expectation 
blocks into which the country has been divided, have already 
been contracted to French, Canadian, British, and Swedish firms 
and, according to Basic Industries Minister Marco Portals, all 
of the blocks will have been contracted out by the end of the 
year. 
  The nickel industry, meanwhile, is in the process of 
increasing its production after a strong decline that began 
following the severing of ties with Eastern Europe, which was 
its primary buyer. Cuba diversified its nickel markets and today 
exports the mineral to 26 countries. Thanks to economic 
partnerships with Canada, The Netherlands, Great Britain, and 
Italy, and the efficiency of Cuban specialists and technicians, 
production will increase this year. Thus, the growth of vital 
branches such as oil, nickel, and cobalt production is 
guaranteed by economic partnerships with foreign firms, none of 
which, in fact, are from the United States. 
  Therefore, the economic blockade it decreed against Cuba has 
backfired on the United States, which is now deprived of 
participation in attractive business opportunities.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Jacques Maurice] </F>
  [Text] Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide opposes U.S. 
intervention in Haiti as a means for his return to power. 
Father Aristide told U.S. public radio on 25 June that he would 
never return to power by way of intervention, which the United 
States does not rule out if the latest measures do not have the 
desired effect. Jacques Maurice reports: 
  [Maurice] President Jean-Bertrand Aristide has finally 
spoken 
his mind about threats of U.S. military intervention in Haiti. 
The former Saint-Jean Bosco parish priest expressed opposition 
to military intervention in his country a few hours after the 
latest U.S. measures -- aimed at commercial flights and 
financial transactions -- took effect. He noted that the 
Haitian Constitution forbids him from making such a request. 
The president-in-exile said: I oppose military intervention 
and military occupation. Aristide called for a surgical strike 
to dislodge the military in power in a NEW YORK TIMES interview. 
I will never, never, never return to power by way of 
intervention, President Aristide added, explaining that he has 
always opposed the idea of U.S. military intervention. Aristide 
opposed establishing a Haitian army-in-exile aimed at 
overthrowing the military regime in power in Port-au-Prince. On 
3 June, the ousted president insisted on quick and determined 
U.S. action to remove those responsible for the coup d'etat, but 
within the scope of the Governors Island agreement signed on 3 
July. Aristide has clearly expressed his position on U.S. 
military intervening in Haiti to restore him to power. This is 
not the Clinton administration's opinion. The U.S. President 
still does not rule out military intervention in Haiti if 
international sanctions do not force the military in power to 
surrender. 
  Both sides are prepared. The U.S. armada remains anchored in 
Haitian territorial waters. A plane is conducting 
reconnaissance flights in the southeast. U.S. crews are nearing 
the northern coast and are imposing their authority. (?Border 
guards) are ready to help in case of failure. Thousands of 
Dominican soldiers patrol the Haitian-Dominican border, soldiers 
who could not stop trafficking in gasoline, yet could kill a 
young Haitian trying to cross into the Dominican Republic. 
  The Haitian military is also prepared. Troops are 
mobilizing, garrisons are being visited, demonstrators are 
protesting intervention, homage is being paid to ancestors, and 
1,001 strategies are being prepared. A military official, who 
has asked to remain anonymous, said that more civilians than can 
be imagined are ready to fight alongside the military. Another 
official said that the Haitian Army has prepared many surprises 
for the invaders. 
  The U.S. Government is considering two alternatives: to 
launch a campaign on the airwaves to promote discord within Army 
ranks and well-to-do Haitians to rise up against military 
officials or intervene militarily to restore democracy but not 
to return Aristide to power.

<F P=106> [By Herold Jean-Francois] </F>
  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 27 Jun (EFE) -- Today, 
Port-au-Prince Mayor Evans Paul contacted the mothers, wives, 
and sons of military personnel, urging them to make their 
relatives in the Army understand the severity of the Haitian 
situation and the real threat posed by a potential foreign 
invasion. 
  The letter sent in the name of the Democratic Unity 
Confederation (KID), presided over by the Port-au-Prince mayor, 
requests that the relatives of military personnel intervene to 
explain to the military that the Armed Forces does not have a 
Charlemagne Peralte or a Pierre Sully at this time. Peralte was 
a hero of the resistance against the 1915 U.S. invasion and 
Sully was a soldier who defended his position during the U.S. 
landing in July 1915. 
  "They cannot continue to threaten a tiger with a pin," Paul 
said in reference to the "de facto" government's threats to the 
United States through which it has warned against military 
intervention. 
  The KID letter says, "The lives of most members of the 
military are in danger," adding, "The personal interests of a 
few people are to blame for this." KID is linked to the 
National Front for Change and Democracy, the coalition that led 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power. President Aristide 
was ousted by a group of military officers headed by General 
Raoul Cedras in September 1991. 
  The letter adds that there is no democracy within the Armed 
Forces, and it tells the mothers, wives, and sons of military 
personnel that Gen. Cedras should explain to them why he is 
endangering the lives of their relatives. 
  "Ask him what good the coup d'etat has done for the people, 
the Army, and the country over the past 33 months," Paul says in 
his letter. In it, he also asks Cedras to present evidence in 
connection with the alleged deaths of military personnel during 
the seven months of Aristide's administration. 
  He also suggests that the relatives ask about the number of 
military personnel who have been "murdered, disappeared, exiled, 
imprisoned, or expelled from the ranks of the Army simply 
because they were accused of favoring the lavalas after the 30 
September 1991 coup d'etat." 
  Paul urges the relatives of military personnel to explain to 
their kin that they are part of the Haitian people and must not 
obey those who are ordering them to repress the people. He also 
notes that they should ignore those who pit them against the 
defenders of the people's rights. 
  In the letter, Paul says they should ask Cedras to respect 
the commitment made when he signed the Governors Island 
Agreement in New York; to resign from his post; and, in turn, to 
help avert foreign military intervention. Paul sent a similar 
letter to Gen. Cedras last week.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Jean Obed Maturin from Jeremie] </F>
  [Excerpts] Sofonie Paul, 1, and Dieula Paul were killed and 
Tortila Paul, 9, was slightly injured in an explosion over the 
weekend in their courtyard in Caracolie, a residential 
neighborhood in Jeremie. Military authorities in Jeremie have 
arrested several people as part of their investigation. Among 
those arrested: Serge Paul, a well-known labor union member and 
Federation of Haitian Workers [CTH] coordinator in Jeremie; 
Paul's wife; and many of Paul's relatives. Paul is the father of 
the two young victims of the explosion. Military authorities 
also arrested for questioning several union members from 
Port-au-Prince who were staying at CTH premises in Caracolie. 
While the union members and Paul's wife were released after a 
night in jail, the military authorities continue to hold Serge 
Paul. Mrs. Paul was very shocked at losing her two daughters. 
[passage omitted] 
  The explosion cut the girls to pieces but caused no property 
damage. Military authorities in Jeremie have not yet confirmed 
via press release whether it was a homemade bomb or a grenade, 
as it is rumored. The two girls were mourned over the weekend.

  [Text] Deputy Planning Minister Maria Teresa Orellana de 
Rendon announced yesterday that the Argentine Government will 
provide economic and technical assistance to El Salvador to 
prevent drug abuse and fight drug trafficking in the country. 
Orellana de Rendon, who was accompanied by Argentine Ambassador 
Roberto Horacio Magnacca, Argentine International Affairs 
Director Eduardo Gonzalez, and several representatives of the 
Argentine Embassy, commented on the need for bilateral efforts 
against drug trafficking. 
  Although she did not give any figures, the deputy minister 
said the assistance will consist of four seminars on preventing 
drug consumption and will focus on education, health, security, 
and law enforcement. 
  Some of the topics to be discussed at the forum are 
upgrading 
security and police forces to fight drug trafficking, providing 
preventive education in schools, and formulating a Latin 
American plan to teach health professionals. 
  "I believe this a very important step by the two countries 
to 
fight drug trafficking," the Argentine ambassador noted. 
  The joint seminars could be held from September to October 
this year with the participation of institutions such as the 
Foreign Relations, Health, Education, and Justice Ministries; 
the Prosecutor General's and Attorney General's Offices; 
security corps (National Police and Civilian National Police); 
and Fundasalva [expansion unknown].

  [Text] Army spokesperson Edith Vargas de Marroquin 
announced that the new Military Recruitment Law under discussion 
by Congress will prevent the abuses that have been committed 
while recruiting volunteers for military service. The new Law 
on Military Service will correct the deficiencies that elicited 
protests from the people affected by this action. 
  In view of the various proposals presented by groups who 
consider themselves to be affected by the law presented by the 
Army, it is unlikely that the reforms will be discussed before 
the next Congress is installed. According to the military 
spokesperson, several sectors proposed reforms which actually 
made recruitment more complicated instead of less 
discriminatory, the intended objective. The new Law on Military 
Service includes salaries and incentives for fulfilling this 
constitutional duty to make it seem more like a social concept 
than an obligation. 
  On another subject, the military spokesperson said the Army 
is not protecting six civil patrolmen whose arrest has been 
ordered for their alleged participation in the murder of 
political leader Jorge Carpio Nicolle last year. The Army has 
firmly stated that military personnel involved in criminal 
actions must be tried.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar has flatly 
denied discussing matters related to the tranfer of U.S. Air 
Force troops to Palmerola with U.S. Secretary of Defense William 
J. Perry. Paz Aguilar made that remark after the top Clinton 
Administration official boarded the airplane that flew him to 
Puerto Rico. 
  "We discussed matters of common interest only," the foreign 
minister said after listing the points that, according to him, 
were discussed during the approximately 20-minute meeting. "We 
broached the future of the U.S. military presence in the 
country, strengthening civil-military action programs, 
establishing a regional center to combat drug trafficking, and 
the situation Haitians are experiencing." 
  Perry categorically noted that only U.S. Air Force units 
stationed in the Southern Command could be moved to Honduran 
territory. He noted that the U.S. military presence in Panama 
concludes on 31 December 1999 and that Palmerola will remain a 
center where U.S. troops have access facilities. 
  "At no time was there any mention of turning Honduras into a 
platform for regional operations. The U.S. policy worldwide is 
to close bases and reduce the number of soldiers, and I do not 
think they are interested in increasing their military presence 
here," Paz Aguilar indicated. 
  He added that there are troops in Panama to guarantee the 
permanent and definite neutrality of the Panama Canal and that 
there are barely 1,000 U.S. soldiers in Honduras, who are 
operating within the framework of reciprocal assistance. 
  "I reiterate that that topic was not discussed, but it is 
clear and definite that Honduras has to refine its relations 
with the United States based on dignity and respect for national 
sovereignty," Paz Aguilar noted. The official said that the 
bilateral military assistance treaty is the product of an era 
that ended with the Cold War. He added that the 1990's face 
totally different challenges, such as drug trafficking. "We 
would like Palmerola to serve as a regional base to fight drug 
trafficking," he stated, as he explained that U.S. specialized 
agencies are waging the war on drug trafficking. 
  When asked to comment on Perry's visit, Presidential 
Designate Walter Lopez Reyes said it was a courtesy visit and 
that they discussed general topics of mutual interest.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 27 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- Honduran President 
Carlos Roberto Reina said today that he would never approve an 
invasion of an American nation, thereby ruling out unofficial 
reports that the United States could invade Haiti in order to 
return democracy to that nation. Reina stressed that even if 
the United Nations made this request, he would not support an 
initiative to invade another nation. 
  The Honduran president also confirmed that his country is a 
favorite for the establishment of a regional center to combat 
drug trafficking. This issue was discussed on Saturday during 
the visit of William Perry, the U.S. secretary of defense. "We 
are no longer in the context of the Cold War. We are no longer 
in the stage of a war of polarized blocs. This is why we want 
to take advantage of international cooperation to defend 
ourselves from vices such as drug trafficking and other world 
scourges," he said. According to Perry, the installation of a 
regional center to combat drug trafficking means the possible 
transfer to Honduras of the aircraft the United States has in 
the Southern Command bases in Panama. 
  This does not mean that the U.S. military presence would 
increase in Honduras where currently approximately 1,200 
soldiers are stationed. These soldiers are replaced every three 
to four months. Rather, Reina noted, this would mean "more 
dialogue." Reina recalled that military relations between 
Honduras and the United States are outlined in an agreement that 
goes back to 1954. The Honduran Legislative Assembly did not 
see the agreement when it was signed, he noted. In this regard, 
he indicated that any agreement on new military relations with 
the United States should be discussed by the Legislative 
Assembly. 
  The president said that the presence of drug traffickers in 
his country is on the rise, which he labeled as "very serious." 
Therefore, he noted, all the nations need help and Honduras 
should take advantage of its "prime" geographic position. The 
regional center could operate in Palmerola, a local air base 
constructed by the U.S. Army in the eighties when Washington 
attempted -- without success -- to topple Nicaragua's Sandinist 
regime through the "contras," who it armed and financed in 
Honduras. Palmerola is located approximately 80 km north of 
Tegucigalpa and its runway has the capacity to receive any type 
of combat plane or the gigantic C-5 Galaxy.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa -- Admitting the existence of "serious" 
flaws in the foreign exchange system -- flaws which have led to 
speculation -- the Central Bank of Honduras [BCH] Board of 
Directors yesterday decided to implement reforms and hold an 
auction of U.S. dollars, which will be overseen by the BCH, 
according to BCH Chairman Hugo Noe Pino. 
  To implement the reforms, the BCH Board of Directors has 
issued a document entitled "Regulation for the Public Exchange 
of Foreign Currency." According to the document, beginning 
today all exchange brokers must turn over their foreign 
currencies to the BCH, which will buy them at referenced market 
rates. This provision excludes dollars in on-demand savings 
accounts. 
  Pino said 60 percent of the dollars acquired so far by the 
BCH will be auctioned off, beginning on 23 June. He also said 
that, before each auction, the general public will be informed 
on the amount and base price of the currency. To guarantee 
honesty, the auction will be handled by a commission comprising 
one delegate each from the BCH, the Association of Honduran 
Banks (AHIBA), savings and loan associations, and exchange 
brokers, as well as two delegates from independent auditing 
firms and one notary public. 
  Pino reported that natural or legal individuals can directly 
or indirectly submit bids to buy currency, adding that the bids 
must fall within a range of a minimum of $2,000 to a maximum of 
$200,000. 
  The daily base buying price will be the average of the 
prices 
bid the previous day. To open this process, the BCH Board of 
Directors has established a balanced average of 8.60 lempiras to 
the dollar. This base price will be modified when the referenced 
exchange rates consistently drop or go higher. The adjustment 
will be effected whenever the current price consistently changes 
over 15 consecutive auctions. 
  Pino pointed out that the bids cannot be higher or lower 
than 
the base price by more than 1 percent. Once bids have been 
received, they will be arranged in descending order and the 
amount of currency available will be assigned to the highest 
bidders. 
  To give low bidders a chance to buy currency, banks and 
savings and loans can bid for a daily maximum of $25,000, while 
exchange brokers will have a daily maximum of $10,000. 
  In conclusion, Pino said currency will not be assigned to 
natural or legal individuals more than once during the same 
auction.

<F P=106> [Report by Alfonso Malespin Jiron] </F>
  [Text] After inaugurating the seminar entitled "Reflections 
on the Democratic Transition," held at the Olof Palme 
Conventions Center, President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro has 
rejected the ultimatum issued by rearmed rebels Charro and 
Northiel [not further identified] and asked them to "surrender 
their weapons and return to civilian life." 
  Accompanied by Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo, President 
Chamorro insisted that the two chiefs stop killing people and 
burning trucks, "because if they do not, not even they will be 
able to farm anything." 
  Northiel threatened to burn any vehicle that dares to 
operate 
in Las Segovias and to murder the drivers in response to what he 
called "the government's failure to keep the agreements signed." 
Presidency Minister Lacayo denied this. "There is no agreement 
with him," Lacayo stated categorically. "They are the ones who 
often refuse to hold talks," Chamorro said, referring to the 
rebels' demands. "I am always sending the people who have to be 
there for talks." During the speech to open this event, which 
is hosted by the National Assembly, the president noted: "We 
have suffered deeply from the legacy of violence, intolerance, 
and confrontation." 
  During an informal news conference, Chamorro reiterated that 
"as long as Violeta is in power, education will continue to be 
secular." "Let us respect one another," she noted, referring to 
the direct demand by the Nicaraguan Bishops Conference to 
include religion in public education. On another matter, the 
president criticized the killing of four children in Acoyapa, 
Chontales Department, at the hands of two teenagers and affirmed 
her support for every antiabortion activity, provided that "a 
religious march does not turn political." 
  According to her, the mass murders are the result of a "lack 
of education," but insisted that this situation has to be 
overcome. "This is a time to build and a time for children to be 
educated. This is no longer the time to kill; this is the time 
for reflection," Chamorro noted.

  [Text] Commander Bayardo Arce has reported that the 
National Directorate of the Sandinist National Liberation Front 
[FSLN] yesterday presented to the Sandinist People's Army [EPS] 
its observations on the Military Code, especially on military 
subordination to civilian authority and on the scope of military 
responsibility. 
  A source said the two sides also discussed relations between 
the Armed Forces and society -- relations "that the law does not 
cover." Arce did not elaborate on these relations. 
  Arce explained: During the meeting "we expressed the 
National Directorate's concern and reported its unanimous 
opinion on the reforms the Military Code requires." 
  He reported that on Tuesday the Sandinist Directorate will 
assess the arguments and explanations presented by the military 
High Command in response to questions posed by the FSLN, adding 
that in the afternoon the directorate will issue a communique to 
make public its official position on the code. 
  The Sandinist leader said: "Our legislative wing is awaiting 
this position to open debates on the code in the National 
Assembly." 
  According to Arce, his party's position is not a product of 
the opinion of the 15 members of the directorate. He affirmed 
that the FSLN sought the opinion of various sectors of society, 
including that of businessmen, retired EPS members, and the 
party's rank and file. Arce described the meeting as "fruitful, 
positive, and constructive." 
  Military spokesmen preferred not to comment on the working 
session with the FSLN. 
  The National Directorate, which has been holding a special 
session since last week, will continue the session Tuesday and 
Wednesday of next week. On Thursday, it will hold a meeting 
with the Board of Directors of the Higher Council of Private 
Enterprise.

  [Text] The 2d District Attorney's Office has to rule 
whether to uphold the provisional release granted to defendant 
Eduardo Herrera Hassan, his lawyer has explained. 
  The 7th Court House, presided over by Judge Nilsa de 
Gonzalez, on 23 June granted the provisional release of Eduardo 
Herrera, who along with 16 other servicemen was charged on one 
count of sedition. According to Herrera's defense lawyer, his 
client was not released, because the prosecutor appealed the 
judge's decision. 
  [Begin recording] [Defense Lawyer Hector Zavala] The judge 
issued a pretrial statement saying she can only try Mr. Herrera 
for an offense that carries a sentence of less than two years 
for the offense of sedition. This ruling, or as the file 
states, denies, as President Guillermo Endara has charged, my 
client tried to topple him on 5 December 1990. The ruling 
states there is no evidence to prove there was an attempt to 
topple the government at that time. [end recording] 
  Lawyer Hector Zavala made the request for a provisional 
release in late April. In her decision, the judge agreed to 
grant a provisional release until the trial is held, but she 
forbad Herrera to leave the country and ordered him to appear 
before that court every month. 
  The 2nd Court of Justice will have to decide whether to 
uphold or revoke the release. If revoked, the final step would 
be to appeal to the Supreme Court of Justice. Eduardo Herrera 
is also charged for his involvement in terrorist acts of 
Operation Let Us Kill Fatty [Asesinar Al Gordito, in reference 
to President Endara] in Chiriqui Province and for evading 
justice.

  [Text] Panama's oil debt with Venezuela and Mexico, within 
the framework of the San Jose Pact, totals $240 million, and 
paying it will have to be done on a long-term basis, Eduardo 
Linares, deputy planning and economic policy minister, has said. 
  The top government official has said Venezuela is not 
pressuring Panama to pay the debt but, rather, is simply 
requesting the renewal of talks. 
  [Begin recording] [Linares] We have just received an 
official 
communication from the Venezuelan Government stating its 
interest in resuming the talks; therefore, we cannot talk of 
pressure. What does exist is a response to our request as a 
responsible government in order to pay to the debt. 
  [Ortega] To pay in what type of manner? This involves many 
millions. The budget was cut, and there is no money. 
  [Linares] The formulas we have proposed to the Mexican 
Government and the one we could reach with Venezuela if we agree 
to resume negotiations allow the government to pay its debt 
within its capabilities in the long term. There are no 
short-term formulas, to be sure. [end recording]

  [Text] London, 24 Jun (AFP-NA) -- Having met with U.K. 
Government officials and politicians, a high-powered delegation 
of five Argentine deputies today concluded a five-day official 
visit to London at the invitation of the U.K. Government. 
  During a news conference, Jorge Matzkin, Justicialist 
(neo-Peronist) bloc leader in the Chamber of Deputies said: 
"This is the first time that an (Argentine) delegation has been 
officially invited" to London by the Foreign Office of the U.K. 
Government since the Malvinas War in 1982. 
  "The main objective of this visit was to improve relations 
with our counterparts, especially in the House of Commons. We 
talked about everything. We openly broached controversial 
issues like the Malvinas Islands and subjects of common 
interest," he pointed out. 
  The five deputies met with David Heathcoat-Amory, the 
secretary of state for Latin American affairs, on 20 June. 
During the meeting, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd suddenly 
appeared to greet the visitors. 
  According to Florencio Acenolaza, chairman of the Foreign 
Relations and Worship Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, Hurd 
recalled his government's stance, saying that it wants "to 
respect the will of the inhabitants" of the Malvinas Islands. 
  The Argentine deputies mentioned that Argentina believes the 
conflict is not between the islanders and Argentina but rather 
between Argentina and the U.K. 
  Acenolaza said the delegation "aired all its grievances over 
the Malvinas Islands without restraint." They even voiced 
concern about issues including "the preservation of the 
environment and oil." 
  "There were no differences or gray areas," he said, 
insisting 
that the current trend is "very positive." He added that it 
constitutes "a new landmark" within a framework of "human rather 
than political relationships." 
  When inviting Kelpers to visit Argentina to establish 
"human, 
not political relations," Matzkin told them: You will like 
Argentina! 
  The lawmakers reported that they did not discuss the thorny 
issue of war crimes committed -- according to Buenos Aires -- by 
British soldiers or the possible request for the extradition of 
former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on war crimes charges. 
  The other members of the Argentine delegation were Francisco 
Duranona, (UCeDe [Democratic Center Union] Lower House bloc 
leader); Javier Menenghini (Radical Civic Union Lower House bloc 
deputy leader); and Marco Micheli (Conservative Party Lower 
House bloc leader).

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 26 Jun (EFE) -- Argentine Vice Foreign 
Minister Fernando Petrella today guaranteed that Argentina would 
not accept any oil exploitation in the Malvinas Islands if this 
activity created unilateral problems harming its stance in the 
dispute over the sovereignty of the islands. 
  Petrella told the Argentine DYN news agency: "Oil is very 
important, but is not of paramount importance, as there is oil 
everywhere. This does not, however, mean that we are giving it 
away to the British." 
  In Petrella's opinion, the possible oil activities in the 
islands "create problems, as there might exist jurisdiction 
issues harming the Argentine stance, and this is unacceptable." 
  In this regard, the vice minister mentioned the High-Level 
Group of Argentine and British officials who will meet on 14 and 
15 July in the city of Buenos Aires to discuss issues of 
bilateral interest, including oil. 
  In Petrella's opinion, the formation of this group involved 
the establishment of an important link between the two 
countries, which have decided to work on the sovereignty issue 
and recognize the existence of a dispute.

<F P=106> ["Special report" by former Central Bank President Rodolfo </F>
Rossi] 
  [Text] Buenos Aires, 24 Jun -- The rise in the prices of 
nearly all raw materials on international markets (as well as 
those of commodities [preceding word in English] of basic 
manufactured goods) poses the question of whether we are 
witnessing a generalized bout of worldwide inflation. 
  The surge in prices is seen in commodities such as coffee, 
the price of which has gone up 66 percent so far this year; 
wool, up 45 percent; and cotton, a 35 percent increase. As for 
crude oil, the WTI [expansion unknown] currently is being quoted 
at more than $20 per barrel rising from $14 in March. 
  Grains have recorded heavy gains. Wheat jumped to the 
forefront in Chicago, rising 21 percent in the last 12 months. 
Corn increased 32 percent in the same period, and soybeans were 
up 18 percent. 
  Argentina's exports stand to benefit from this surge in the 
value of grains and oil seeds. This year export earnings will 
be $600 million higher than last year. It also will benefit 
from the increase in the value of oil, and its exports will 
total at least $1.25 billion. 
  Notwithstanding this, within an international context 
characterized by great volatility in quotations, the drop in the 
value of the U.S. dollar over the last few days leads one to 
forecast an increase in international interest rates (not only 
in the United States, but also in Europe) on account of the need 
for attracting capital and also as a move to defend their 
respective currencies (the U.S. trade deficit grew 22 percent in 
April compared with the previous month, amounting to $8.4 
billion). 
  The "climax" of the increase in interest rates, also 
prompted 
by the inflationary syndrome -- a rise in the value of raw 
materials and commodities [preceding word in English] -- 
probably will offset the benefit derived from better export 
prices. 
  The negative effect for our country would be the incidence 
of 
higher international prices on domestic prices, which would 
adapt to the increase in prices.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 23 Jun (NA) -- Cordoba Governor 
Eduardo Angeloz has warned that "some provinces are on the brink 
of collapse or bankruptcy." Angeloz added that the economic plan 
"has started breaking the pillars sustaining it." 
  "When you start setting strict guidelines limiting 
productive 
activities or people's activities things start to break down. 
People start complaining and you start seeing the possibility of 
unrest in many towns and provinces," the governor said. 
  Angeloz said he is not pointing his arrows directly at 
Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo. The governor believes Cavallo 
"cannot feel he owns the country. He cannot dictate rules for 
others simply to follow or be placed on lists under definitions 
only he makes." 
  The governor said the main causes of discontent that might 
result in "social upheavals" are produced mainly by "the growing 
trade balance deficit, the transfer to the nation of bankrupted 
education centers and health systems, and the national 
government's indifference to producer needs." 
  "People perceive that their personal situation is not 
improving, that the country is not growing, and notice that the 
social security system has very big holes," Angeloz insisted. 
  Angeloz protested because the provinces now must administer 
their education and health systems "without resources," a 
situation that is aggravated "because now the provinces get 44 
percent and the nation 56 percent of the 4 billion pesos of 
federal income sharing, a situation that is just the opposite of 
the situation we had before." 
  Angeloz expressed doubts that former President Alfonsin had 
said that the Radical Party [Radical Civic Union, UCR] will lose 
the 1995 election, but just in case he made clear that he does 
not share that belief, stressing: "Those who leave the 
battlefield, those who do not fight, are leaving an empty space 
that others will occupy." 
  "This will not happen to the UCR. We will fight in all areas 
to transform the party and create a government alternative," 
Angeloz promised. He made these remarks during the program "Two 
Voices" that is broadcast on cable television.

  [Text] On 26 June, two days after making the announcement, 
Interior Secretary Jorge Carpizo withdrew his resignation. In 
fact, there was considerable expectation over the weekend over 
the outcome of Carpizo's announcement on 24 June. It was 
announced that same day that Carpizo and President Salinas would 
discuss the matter on 25 and 26 June. Saturday was a long day 
of waiting and the following letter addressed to the president 
and the general public was released on 26 June at noon. The 
text of the letter follows: 
  1. Due to the decisive support I have received from ample 
sectors of society, the president of the republic, political 
parties, and nongovernment, professional, and academic 
organizations, and in order to dispel the belief I am acting 
irresponsibly and unpatriotically, I will remain in the post of 
interior secretary to fulfill the inherent duties of that post 
during the federal electoral process. 
  2. I hereby confirm the commitments established in the 
agreement signed by eight political parties and myself on 27 
January 1994 regarding democracy, justice, and peace. Likewise, 
I guarantee my impartiality, which I intend to firmly maintain. 
To do this, I will require the support of the general public and 
political parties so that there will be no further speculation 
concerning the party to which I referred in my letter of 
resignation. Any disclosure on my part at this time would 
seriously affect my impartiality and the duties I must carry out 
in the forthcoming electoral process. 
  3. I will continue to strictly adhere to the de jure state 
by holding clean, reliable, objective, and honest elections. 
  4. I hereby affirm my current post is the last political 
post I will hold during my lifetime. I will not, under any 
circumstance, hold a political post in the future. 
  5. I urge all Mexicans to strengthen our de jure state, to 
always speak the truth, and to make political civility and 
mutual respect govern our actions. In my opinion, these 
principles constitute an irreversible commitment. 
  Dr. Jorge Carpizo concluded his letter by thanking the 
general public, the president of the republic, and the political 
parties for their support in urging him to continue as the head 
of the Interior Secretariat.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Juan De Dios Garcia Davish] </F>
  [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas, 23 Jun -- The Zapatist 
National Liberation Army [EZLN] has extended its operations 15 
km into Ocosingo, Altamirano, and Las Margaritas, where it has 
intensified its rustling and looting, Jorge Constantino Kanter, 
a leader of the cattle ranchers, has reported here. Meanwhile, 
the State Prosecutor's Office has arrested 127 members of the 
State Council of Indian and Peasant Organizations [CEOIC] who 
have occupied seven estates. 
  Constantino Kanter and the president of the State Federation 
of Small Rural Owners, Fidel Enrique Culebro Trejo, have 
confirmed they will stage a sit down protest in front of the 
Government Palace tomorrow to demand that the state and federal 
authorities clear at least 200 estates that have been occupied 
since the beginning of the armed conflict by Zapatists or CEOIC 
members. Laura del Carmen Mayagoitia Penagos, owner of the 
Granja de la Paz Estate in Simojovel Municipality, has announced 
she will start a hunger strike. 
  Culebro Trejo said that even though they will not obtain 
positive results to their demands, they will avoid a 
confrontation with the Zapatists and the CEOIC squatters 
inasmuch as "this would be a mistake." In this struggle, we will 
defend ourselves legally. 
  To this effect, Constantino Kanter has said the Zapatists 
have again started to collect war taxes for the mobilization of 
animals or traffic, which, in addition to the lootings, has 
increased uncertainty because there are no kinds of guarantees. 
  Both men have said they will be joined in their protests by 
at least 1,200 Tzotzil, Tojolabal, and Tzeltal Indians who have 
fled to avoid being enrolled in the EZLN ranks. These Indians 
live in unhealthy conditions, even though they have homes in 
which to live, but these are in the area of conflict. 
  Meanwhile, early this morning, public security officials and 
judiciary policemen began to clear out the seven estates that 
grow export products. They arrested 127 people and charged them 
with private property damage, association with criminal intent, 
and misappropriation. During the operation to clear out the 
estates of Ojo de Agua, Chiquita, Chacatelje Tobruc, Argelia, 
and Pinotepa, all in Mazatan Municipality, the authorities 
arrested 102 people and 25 others on the El Rincon Coffee 
Plantation. All of these individuals were turned over to the 
Attorney General's Office by State Prosecutor Arturo Becerra 
Martinez and Police Coordinator General Augusto del Pino Estrada. 
  During the operation to clear out the estates, the police 
seized machetes and knives and destroyed rustic shacks that had 
been built of wood, palms, and plastic. The shacks had banners 
reading: "We demand respect for land occupations; CIOAC 
[expansion unknown], CNPA [National Coordinating Board for the 
Ayala Plan], CEOIC. We will win with the unity of the poor." 
  According to a spokesman for the State Prosecutor's Office, 
the operations to clear out the estates were ordered following 
the charges raised before this office. The land and estates 
were returned to Rodolfo Flores Garcia, Rolanda Stivajet Corral, 
Roberto Fourzali Moises, Alfredo Sanchez Gomez, Pedro Rene 
Bodegas, and Bernardo Pholenz Krauze. 
  Police Coordinator General Augusto del Pino Estrada has 
reported that to prevent further land occupations, special 
surveillance measures will be established in Mazatan 
Municipality to guarantee security. 
  Hermino Verdugo Munoz, regional CEOIC leader, has advised if 
they have not received clear responses to their requests by 
tomorrow, they will take over the international bridges linking 
Mexico with the Central American Isthmus, and they will block 
entries to six municipal capitals of the coastal area.

<F P=106> [Report by Victor Torres] </F>
  [Text] Campeche, 21 Jun -- President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari announced that nearly 1.2 billion new pesos will be 
allocated to the states. The president also indicated that in 
the past five years, revenues other than those derived from 
crude oil have increased 34 percent in real terms and the number 
of taxpayers that are not salaried workers has more than 
tripled. In addition, he urged all taxpayers not to avoid 
paying their taxes so that those most in need may enjoy the 
benefits resulting from an increase in social expenditures. 
  During the closing of the 26th National Tax Revenue Officers 
Conference, the president explained that fiscal collection for 
social expenditures has increased, and that federal taxes have 
been cut by half. In addition, individual and commercial tax 
burdens have been lowered and tax limits have also been reduced. 
He added that seven out of every 10 new taxpayers have been 
included during the current administration. 
  During the event, which took place at the Francisco de Paula 
Toro Theater, the president pointed out that federal government 
allocations to the states have increased more than 25 percent 
since 1989. He also reported that there would be a 55 percent 
increase in transfers to the eight states with the most pressing 
needs. 
  The president explained that a more balanced state-federal 
government relationship has been sought through the signing of 
clear-cut agreements with each state government. In this 
respect, he mentioned agreements involving such subjects as 
joint value added tax supervision, election list verification 
and obligations fulfillment, full supervision of the vehicle 
ownership and use tax, and even municipal participation as it 
relates to toll bridges operated by the federal government. 
  Salinas de Gortari, who arrived from Puebla and is scheduled 
to leave for Aguascalientes, commented that "we have supported 
the local fiscal administrations in order to reverse falling 
trends in local traditional sources of revenue, especially the 
real estate tax. 
  With respect to additional resources to be distributed among 
the states, the president of the republic stated that the 
Finance and Public Credit Secretariat had estimated the annual 
adjustment of the resources corresponding to 1993, as well as 
that corresponding to the first quarter of 1994. According to 
the president, "fortunately, just as in the case of last year, 
the difference is in favor of the states of the Federation." 
  He explained that adding the concepts of the 1993 adjustment 
and that of the first quarter of 1994 means that the states as a 
whole will have additional resources totalling approximately 1.2 
billion new pesos. He stressed that, in order not to create any 
uncertainties, every state without exception has balances in its 
favor. 
  The chief executive, who arrived in this city during a heavy 
downpour, listened as Finance Secretary Pedro Aspe explained the 
progress made in fiscal issues and State Finance Secretary Maria 
Teresa Patron, representing fellow her colleagues, made an 
assessment of the issues discussed during the meeting. 
  Salinas de Gortari stated that progress had been made in 
modernizing the state's tax and allotment system. He said: "We 
have done it on the basis of more justice and efficiency to 
benefit more Mexicans." 
  It has been possible to collect more in order to have more 
real revenues to meet the demands of expenditures for social 
progress in Mexico. If not, how will we build more schools? 
How will we provide more potable water and electrical services 
to the millions of Mexicans who have started to receive 
benefits? How will we be able to start building a hospital 
every three weeks, construct the largest number of housing units 
in the country's history, or increase spending in education to 
its highest level this year, or during this century, as it 
relates to GNP? 
  The president explained that, at the beginning of his 
administration, there were 19 or 20 federal taxes and that the 
number has now been cut in half. In addition, the rate of those 
taxes still in effect has also been cut. 
  Salinas told the country's tax officers that the specific 
point at which individuals begin to pay their tax obligations 
has been cut and that "at the same time, rates have been cut and 
base rates have been widened, which has always been the main 
concern of everyone committed to tax fairness." He pointed out 
that seven out of every 10 taxpayers were incorporated during 
this administration. 
  The president provided more details: As relates to the real 
estate tax, 0.3 percent of GDP was being collected two decades 
ago and the ratio has fallen to 0.02 percent. In this respect, 
a trend reversal has taken place, which means that some 
municipalities have been able to increase revenue collection by 
100, 200, and even 400 percent. Today, real estate tax revenues 
have increased to nearly 0.3 percent of GDP. 
  "Let us not forget that countries with development levels 
that are similar to ours have collected about 2 percent of GNP 
in property taxes each year. In other words, we have a lot of 
ground to cover, especially with regard to the local effort, and 
at the federal government level we are ready to support you in 
all those efforts that will allow you to obtain greater 
resources through this traditional source of local revenue," 
Salinas added. 
  Finally, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari reaffirmed the 
goal of maintaining an equitable relationship between the 
federation and the states, attaining more equity and efficiency, 
and, above all, keeping alive the possibility of improving ways 
of meeting the valid demands of fellow citizens.

<F P=106> [Article by Luis Acevedo Pesquera] </F>
  [Text] The political events of the past five and a half 
months of the final year of the current presidential term have 
made the vulnerability of and lack of confidence in the Mexican 
economic program obvious to local and foreign investors. 
  According to data provided by the SHCP [Finance and Public 
Credit Secretariat], the INEGI [National Institute of 
Statistics, Geography, and Information Science], the Bank of 
Mexico, and private consulting companies, the federal government 
will support the awaited economic takeoff by reprogramming 
public expenditures for the rest of 1994. 
  Reaching satisfactory statistical levels with export 
revenues 
has also being taken into account, although this mechanism has 
created something of a paradox, because the economic opening, by 
replacing consumer expenditures, has failed to remove the 
obstacles that impede domestic production and job creation. 
  Authorities believe that domestic supply and demand will 
improve by year end thanks to a combination of these two 
factors; namely, current public expenditures, estimated at "to 
what prudence dictates," and revenues from exports. 
  To that effect, the GDP is expected, statistically speaking, 
to reach an annual growth rate of 1.0 to 1.9 percent. That is 
the best case scenario. 
  But even if the economic recovery were to reach the best 
estimates for the whole year, the population's demand for jobs 
would still not be met and would increase the government's 
social debt that has accrued throughout the current presidential 
term. 
  According to these sources, the reorganization of 
expenditures and export revenues, in theory, would achieve the 
ultimate goal of formally reviving the basic indicators: supply 
and demand. Abel Hibert, an analyst for Vector Brokerage House, 
says that statistically speaking, this recovery is important 
because the two indicators represent 80 percent of GDP. 
  The analyst added that based on the gap in which public 
spending growth multipliers operate, it is conceivable that "the 
national economy will grow at reasonable rates" beginning in the 
fourth quarter of the year. This will be possible insofar as 
the best possible scenario includes complete political stability. 
  Despite the sectorial heterogeneity, official reports on 
the first semester of 1994 indicate that the economic 
deceleration has already reached its lowest point. 
Nevertheless, the reactivation strategy adopted at the 
beginning of the year has yielded none of the expected results. 
Domestic consumption has stagnated, the strongest evidence of 
which is the commercialization of durable goods. Domestic sales 
in the automotive industry dropped 11.1 percent from January to 
April, a situation that has continued since the third quarter of 
1993. 
  The outlook is no better for nondurable goods. Perhaps the 
situation has been aggravated by imported goods, which divert 
consumer preferences and lead to serious contradictions in local 
production by swelling inventories and deterring productive 
investment. 
  Speaking of investment, preliminary SHCP and INEGI reports 
show that a considerable number of the projects announced late 
in 1993 -- all except those of the country's biggest and most 
profitable enterprises -- were postponed indefinitely. 
  The construction industry, a sector that more accurately 
represents investment, achieved 4.5 percent growth at the close 
of the first quarter, mainly as the result of the construction 
of petrochemical plants, highways, and public projects, but 
clearly not because of the construction of public sector 
projects. 
  The Construction Industry Chamber said the sector 
experienced 
a significant drop in the four-month period, resulting in the 
unemployment of 58 percent of its members. 
  The investment sector was further weakened by the fact that 
although steel production increased 11.3 percent until April, 
cement production barely increased to 4.5 percent, a figure 
lower than the 6.5 percent registered during the last quarter of 
1993 and the first quarter of 1994. 
  "A high degree of consumer debt, increased unemployment, a 
lack of job security, macroeconomic uncertainties, and higher 
interest rates have combined forces to postpone purchases of 
durable goods," Hibert pointed out. 
  A similar situation is unfolding in the field of investment. 
SCHP sources have admitted that the vicious circle of scant 
demand and reduced investment leads to lower supply and, 
consequently, stagnation. 
  The public expenditure reorganization, which, particularly 
in 
view of the Chiapas crisis, had been regarded along with the 
external sector as a catalyst for immediate growth, has not 
yielded the desired results even though the deterioration of the 
main economic indicators has stopped. 
  The conditions do not currently exist to attain the growth, 
consumption, and investment objectives presented to Congress in 
the economic program. What is worse, we must now add to this 
situation the authorities' decision to tighten restrictions on 
the handling of money with the purpose of checking exchange and 
financial pressures. 
  The method used during the first half of the year will 
continue until late into the six-year term as the result of both 
poor domestic demand and the prevailing instability. This will 
make it possible for the new government to begin its 
administration with rising rates, as has happened in the 
previous three administrations.

<F P=106> ["Part one" of a report on an interview with Ignacio </F>
Pichardo Pagaza, secretary general of the National Executive 
Committee, CEN, of the Mexican Institutional Revolutionary 
Party, PRI, by reporter Jose Quintero; place and date not given; 
quotation marks as published] 
  [Text] Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza, secretary general of the 
National Executive Committee, CEN, has told UNOMASUNO: "The 
Camachistas [followers of Manuel Camacho Solis, former 
commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas]" have not 
attacked the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI]. The party 
will do nothing against Manuel Camacho Solis. He is still a PRI 
militant. "Camacho, who I respect, decided to resign from his 
post as peace commissioner. It was his personal and respectable 
decision, and it is wrong to attribute this resignation to any 
statement that our presidential candidate could have made on the 
peace negotiations in Chiapas. 
  The party will do nothing against the PRI militants who 
belong to the so-called Group of 30. That group "is not our 
enemy. We live in a pluralistic and heterogeneous society where 
there is respect and tolerance for the opinions of the citizens, 
who are free to express themselves. PRI does not agree with 
their opinions, but they are absolutely free to make them known. 
The party will do nothing about that." 
  Pichardo noted: "They are free to state their opinion, what 
happens is that we disagree with some of their positions, 
although there is agreement on the need for promoting democracy 
in our country." 
  During an extensive interview, this newspaper asked him: 
What is the PRI's situation as a result of the attack by the 
Camachistas, considering that Camacho himself stated in his 
resignation letter that presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo 
did not give him a vote of confidence in the negotiations for 
peace in Chiapas and hints that this was one of the causes of 
his resignation? 
  [Pichardo] The truth is that there is no attack by the 
Camachistas. Manuel Camacho, whom I respect, made a decision he 
attributed, mistakenly, in my opinion, to statements made by our 
presidential candidate. He decided to resign from his post as 
commissioner for peace and reconciliation. This is a 
respectable decision that is personal. 
  "He also said two other important things. He said that he 
will abstain from any political activity during the rest of this 
administration. He also said something I believe he said 
recently during an interview, that he remains a member of the 
PRI. All this leads to the conclusion that there is no attack 
by the Camachistas. The party is working hard and showing 
respect for the current position of Manuel Camacho." 
  [Quintero] Nothing will be done against him? 
  [Pichardo] Not at all. He has a very respectable personal 
position. 
  [Quintero] Nothing will be done against the Group of 30 
militants either? 
  [Pichardo] No. PRI realizes that we live in a pluralistic 
and heterogeneous society and that the fundamental element is 
respect and tolerance for the opinion of the citizens, who are 
free to express themselves. This group of citizens is 
exercising its constitutional right to meet and analyze the 
country's problems and to freely state its opinion. 
  "Another thing concerns their positions' being in agreement 
with the party's position. They are free, and the party is not 
going to consider this one way or another. They are free to 
express their opinions. What happens is that we disagree with 
some of the positions stated by this group, although we all 
agree that we must work for greater democracy in our country. 
  "I want to tell you that, in the opinion of the chairman of 
the CEN, the march toward democracy is permanent and endless. 
No political system in the world can claim it has a perfect 
democracy. It is always possible to find deficiencies and 
weaknesses, and therefore it is possible to take corrective 
action." 
  [Quintero] Is there not too much tolerance for those people? 
  [Pichardo] No. There can never be too much tolerance. We 
believe they are exercising their constitutional right to meet 
and to freely express their points of view. This does not mean 
that we agree with what they say. 
  [Quintero] Do you think there is a campaign against the PRI? 
  [Pichardo] There are political campaigns. They are very 
intense, not against the PRI, but in the search for political 
power there is, of course, heat produced by the campaign. 
  [Quintero] Are there campaigns from any specific group? 
  [Pichardo] Not at all. These are different matters. The 
party has its own dynamics and course, and this group of 
citizens is free to express its points of view. We do not view 
its members as enemies or criticize their right to express their 
points of view. This does not mean we agree with them. They can 
meet and express their opinion on national problems." 
<H5>  Withdrawn Employees </H5>
  Later on, Pichardo Pagaza was asked whether present 
government employees, who came from the PRI ranks, were not 
turning their backs on their own party. The Mexican replied: 
"No. What has happened is that the new legal dispositions 
establish limits for government employees. Several employees 
have interpreted those dispositions very broadly, and others, 
fortunately only a few, have stopped exercising a right that is 
guaranteed by the Constitution and secondary laws. 
  "Any citizen, including those who occupy a post in 
government, as long as they do not use their offices' assets and 
supplies or work during office hours, can fully exercise their 
right to participate in political activities. Fortunately, many 
are already doing this; others have withdrawn, but they are 
smaller in number." 
  At the beginning of the interview held in one of the CEN's 
private offices at PRI facilities, Pichardo Pagaza said the PRI 
and its candidate to the Presidency of the republic, as well as 
the rest of its candidates to other elected positions, are 
carrying out an intense political campaign throughout the 
country. "The information, the real situation is that the party 
is vigorous, well organized, and has overcome the tremendous 
blow of losing Luis Donaldo Colosio, our candidate for the 
Presidency of the republic. We have now gathered around Ernesto 
Zedillo Ponce de Leon, who is competing at a national level." 
  He emphasized: "It is the PRI that is campaigning, enthused, 
facing the future, and convinced that it confronts a very strong 
electoral competition. The party is in an electoral process 
where all the parties have equal conditions, where the PRI no 
longer has a protective mantle, and where there are autonomous 
electoral bodies that are now geared towards the people. We 
have a new electoral law and a number of recent factors that 
have been assimilated by the PRI rank and file. Thus, we are 
facing a new, unknown process, which is a challenge and a 
motivation to us." 
  [Quintero] When you say the PRI no longer has a protective 
mantle, are you referring to the often-criticized PRI-government 
symbiosis, and does this mean that the PRI will be autonomous 
and independent from the government? 
  [Pichardo] That is correct. The party is aware that it is 
necessary that it remain autonomous with regard to the 
government. Not only must it be autonomous, but it must uphold 
it vanguardist, advanced position within the party itself. We 
feel proud when elected PRI officials comply with their civic 
duties. We also feel compelled, however, to point out the 
errors, mistakes, and unfulfilled promises of PRI officials who 
are not meeting the voters' expectations. 
  "You have mentioned an important point, but for many years 
the PRI was the sole party, and the political struggle took 
place -- it was an exclusive struggle -- within the party. 
Conditions have changed, Mexican society has changed, and the 
PRI is promoting those changes. We are now facing a challenge, 
but this also means that we must act in a totally democratic 
manner.... 
  "It means equality of conditions with the rest of the 
parties 
and facing impartial electoral institutions where, from the 
officials at the voting tables to the ones at the highest levels 
of the Federal Electoral Institute General Council, there are 
private citizens and not the government or political parties. 
Far from involving a feeling that we are in an advantageous 
position, the new situation is a true challenge and positively 
motivates the PRI and its political competition.

<F P=106> [Article by Cleber Praxedes] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia -- The National Accounting Office (TCU) has 
found out that the sale of the state-owned package of majority 
shares of public enterprises has caused a price slump, 
preventing the government from making a profit through the 
possible increase in the value of the shares after the 
transaction. The TCU, which made a general evaluation of the 
National Privatization Program (PND), advocated a reformulation 
of the program. 
  The devaluation of shares could be avoided through a 
parcelled sale of shares over a specific period, PCU member 
Bento Bugarin said. 
  According to the auditors who reviewed the program, only 5.4 
percent of all collected funds were in currency, which helped 
alleviate the Union's serious fiscal situation. The rest of the 
price paid for privatized enterprises was paid with government 
debt certificates, which were bought with substantial discounts 
on the financial market. 
  The TCU found out that capital investments made by the 
government in the enterprises within the PND were several times 
higher than the amounts that were finally obtained from the 
transaction. According to Bugarin, the funds that were obtained 
are not aimed at any specific objective. This means that they 
did not contribute to developing any activities in which the 
participation of the state is essential, like the construction 
of schools or hospitals or other objectives that might improve 
the people's living standards. 
  According to the TCU report, the lack of clear rules for the 
privatization process and for management of the privatized 
enterprises led to the formation of monopolies in areas like the 
iron and steel sector. 
  For Bugarin, who read the report at the TCU plenary session, 
the sale of share packages, the sale of a low number of shares 
to employees, and the lack of incentives for the participation 
of small investors prevented the democratization of capital, 
permitting the sale of enterprises to single economic groups, 
which is something that goes against PND objectives. 
  One of the factors that was noticeable to TCU technicians 
was 
the participation of the Companhia Vale do Rio Doce in the 
auctions. The Constitution sets forth that Congress must 
authorize state enterprises' participation in private 
enterprises.

<F P=106> [Article by Maria Helena Tachinardi; quotation marks as </F>
published] 
  [Text] The government wants to modify the Industrial 
Property (Brands and Patents) Bill the Chamber of Deputies 
submitted to the Senate. The proposed modifications are now in 
the hands of Antonio Mariz (PMDB-PB) [Brazilian Democratic 
Movement Party-Paraiba] and Jose Richa (PSDB-PR) [Brazilian 
Social Democracy Party-Parana] -- the rapporteurs of the 
Constitution and Justice and Economic Affairs Committees of the 
Senate, respectively. The modifications are based on an 
agreement approved during the Uruguay round of GATT talks held 
in April. The agreement is known as TRIPS ("Trade-Related 
Intellectual Property Rights") [given in English]. 
  Bio-technically, the TRIPS agreement does not impose any 
major restrictions on obtaining patents on microorganisms, says 
Jose Roberto d'Affonseca Gusmao, the National Institute of 
Industrial Property (INPI) president. Article 27 of the GATT 
agreement states that "patents will be granted and their rights 
will be fully enjoyable, without discrimination over the 
involved technological field. Patents may not apply to plants 
or animals, but they can apply to microorganisms. In the case 
of plants, however, a `sui generis' system can be adopted if 
there is no system of patents for plant species." 
  This article does not clash with the government suggestion 
to 
maintain patents on microorganisms but not on plants or animals. 
  Compulsory licenses: Gusmao said the adjustments 
proposed by the government deal with the wording of regulations. 
The GATT agreement states that compulsory licenses may be 
granted provided they meet domestic market needs, except in 
cases of unfair competition as defined by court or 
administrative authorities. The agreement adds that the 
appropriate authorities may cancel compulsory licenses if the 
circumstances that justified the issuance of such licenses 
disappear and will probably not reappear. The INPI president 
said the bill in the Senate will have to be adjusted as follows: 
  "Pipeline": Article 70 of the TRIPS agreement 
provides for a "pipeline" system (patent protection on products 
being developed and/or those yet to be sold on the Brazilian 
market, until the patent in the originating country expires), 
even in countries that adopt grace periods before granting the 
patent. It also provides for a five-year period of exclusive 
sale on such products to prevent imitation. 
  In case of the "pipeline" protection, the government 
suggested a modification prepared by Deputy Roberto Freire, 
which the Chamber of Deputies did not approve. The government 
wants to protect patents that have already been launched abroad, 
provided the products -- patented in one or more countries -- 
have not been sold on the Brazilian market. The text approved 
by the Chamber of Deputies says that "pipeline" protection will 
be granted only to non-patented products. 
  Domestic manufacture versus imports: Article 27 of the TRIPS 
agreement says patents will be granted and their rights fully 
enjoyable regardless of the place where the product was invented 
or whether the products are imported or locally produced. 
Gusmao said this article, which is not very clear, will be 
submitted to the new World Trade Organization (WTC). "Brazil 
will respect the WTC decision. The government believes a bill 
adjusted to the TRIPS should prevail. 
  The bill at the Senate conditions a patent to full and 
complete production of the patented product in Brazilian 
territory, in order to meet domestic market needs, with full use 
of the patented process. To assure this "compulsory local 
production," the bill provides for the issue of compulsory 
licenses to local manufacturers three years after the issue of 
the patent. 
  Gusmao said the government believes "importation does not 
prove the use of the patent." That is, the patent must be 
exploited in Brazil, and not through imports. The government 
supports the local exploitation condition, which foments 
industrialization." 
  Parallel importation: This is the importation of 
patented products without the authorization of the patent owner. 
Interfarma -- an organization of 39 foreign laboratories -- has 
stated that the TRIPS agreement forbids parallel importation. 
The government, however, maintains that the GATT agreement 
"says nothing" about parallel importation. Gusmao said parallel 
importation can be admitted only within a common market or a 
free-trade zone with reciprocal rights. For example, it will be 
authorized in Mercosur [Common Market of the South], through 
regulations in the intellectual property rights code of the four 
countries. Brazilian, Argentine, Uruguayan, and Paraguayan 
authorities analyzed the subject last week. 
  In its suggested modifications, Gusmao said the government 
does not consider parallel importation because it is 
inconsistent with the requirement of local exploitation of the 
patent.

<F P=106> [Article by special correspondent Silvia Pisani] </F>
  [Text] Ottawa -- The first day of President Carlos Menem's 
visit to Canada was full of diplomatic signs: There were doubts 
about a possible meeting (later confirmed) with U.S. President 
Bill Clinton, while on the other hand Argentina ratified its 
international alignment with Washington. 
  "If the United States is negotiating the membership of other 
countries in NAFTA it is because its two partners agree," Menem 
told Canadian congressmen, who asked him to define his position 
on the country which they describe as "the elephant that sleeps 
by our side." Apparently, Menem's answer did not please the 
leader of Congress. He told him that if he had trouble 
negotiating with Mercosur [Common Market of the South], he "can 
seek our advice." All this was said amid smiles. 
  Today, Menem will watch the Argentine soccer team play its 
first match in the World Soccer Cup, one of the reasons that 
prompted him to travel to these latitudes. One activity on his 
official agenda is to watch the Argentine national soccer team 
play Greece. Menem will attend the next match, against Nigeria, 
from a seat in the stadium in Boston. 
  A few months ago, Menem planned to attend the matches of the 
Argentine national team in the United States, so a meeting with 
Clinton was slated. Following the electoral setback last April, 
however, Menem changed his mind and canceled everything. A 
little later, in May, he again changed his mind and he tried to 
resume the original agenda. 
  "So far nothing has been arranged," Menem said about his 
possible meeting with Clinton while Argentine delegation sources 
gave the meeting "a 0.01-percent chance," adding that if it 
happens it will be a "real surprise for everyone." And so it 
was. Sweeping aside all pessimistic forecasts, it was later 
learned that Clinton would receive Menem on 24 June at the White 
House. 
  Perhaps with the Constituent Assembly in mind, Menem made an 
observation about the role of the vice president. He recalled 
the resignation of his predecessor Raul Alfonsin, saying that in 
that case, "it would have been logical for the vice president to 
take charge." 
  Menem made more definitions: 

  -  The Argentine proposal to 
send troops to the Bosnian front stands, even if congressional 
approval is necessary. "Every Argentine soldier knows his 
mission is to defend peace and to reinstate it where it is 
lost," Menem said. A decision on this subject is imminent. 
"Perhaps next week," Menem said. 
  -  Argentina will sign an 
agreement next week for the nonproliferation of nuclear 
weapons. 
  -  Argentina may join NAFTA, but has yet to be invited to 
do so. Menem said it would best be to invite the whole of 
Mercosur to join. 

  NAFTA was one of the points discussed during his meeting 
with 
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien. The Argentine Government 
invited a Canadian delegation to visit Buenos Aires to explain 
its position regarding the trade agreement with the United 
States and Mexico. 
  Although it belongs to NAFTA, Canada has some disagreements 
with Washington and is attempting to counterbalance Washington's 
enormous weight by bringing new members into the group. 
  Most of Menem's entourage members kept an eye on Washington. 
"The fast track [preceding two words in English] was approved, 
the fast track was approved!" someone said in a low voice 
regarding the U.S. Government petition to speed up in Congress a 
list, which has yet to be drafted, of countries that could join 
NAFTA. 
  Will Argentina be included? The impression of entourage 
members yesterday was yes, but they doubt if the status given to 
Argentina "will be the same as that given to Chile... which will 
be on better terms." 
  Menem wants to broaden his enthusiasm for sport. "I may soon 
begin to play rugby," Menem told the members of a national 
softball team that is playing in a championship here and who 
invited him to attend one of their matches. "Just give me a 
bat, tell me what to do, and I will learn fast," he said.

<F P=106> [Article by Juan Hernandez Acen] </F>
  [Text] Caracas, 26 Jun (PL) -- Participation of civil 
society, mechanisms of consensus to deal with third countries, 
and free trade zones are some of the challenges and hurdles 
facing the soon-to-be-created Caribbean States Association (AEC). 
  Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, a nation that belongs to 
the Group of Three [G-3], along with Mexico and Colombia, which 
tomorrow will become members of the AEC, will be the site of a 
new regional initiative that intends to group 37 states and 
territories in the Caribbean Basin. 
  The Caribbean Sea, a geographic, historical, and cultural 
confluence once in the sight of extraterritorial nations, is 
getting ready to become the center of an extended region of 
cooperation in view of the challenges posed by the international 
arena. 
  Andres Serbin, director of the Venezuelan Social and 
Political Studies Institute (Invesp) and one of the advocates of 
the integrationist initiative, said here today that the creation 
of the AEC constitutes an important regional step toward 
internationalization and the emergence of economic blocs. 
  In a conversation with PRENSA LATINA, Serbin maintained that 
the association is a response to common fears of being excluded 
and neglected by the international economic system. The expert 
believes the search for methods to include civilian society in 
the integrationist movement is one of the main challenges of the 
AEC, which will group more than 200 million people. 
  He explained that the integration cannot be seen from a 
short-term point of view; the participation of society in an 
association where heterogeneity is the basic characteristic, in 
addition to government and business agreements, is essential. 
  According to the initiative, the AEC is attempting to group 
the English-speaking community (Caricom) [Caribbean Common 
Market], Central and South American countries with coasts on the 
Caribbean Sea, the West Indies (France), Aruba and the 
Netherlands Antilles (Holland), Puerto Rico and the Virgin 
Islands (United States), and British dependencies under a "broad 
and flexible" system. 
  Contrary to the G-3, the Central American Common Market, or 
Mercosur [Common Market of the South] (Brazil, Argentina, 
Uruguay, and Paraguay), the AEC will be formed by a number of 
mostly small countries, which in some cases have different 
interests, development levels, culture, and languages. 
  If we want the emergence of a regional entity, Serbin said, 
we have to establish the mechanism to get the people to contact 
each other and to participate in the decisionmaking process. It 
should not just be left up to the governments. 
  For the creation of a free trade zone, the AEC will also 
face 
the challenge of making the economies of independent states 
compatible with that of 12 dependent states, which have also 
shown an interest in participating in the association. 
  The participation of France, as an observer, involves a very 
powerful actor, which opens up a crossword puzzle for the 
regional participants. Such a situation also raises the question 
of whether the creation of an AEC free trade zone will also open 
up to the European and U.S. markets with a direct presence in 
the Caribbean basin, the expert indicated. In this regard, the 
AEC must be a convergence of regional interests that can iron 
out differences with regard to other regional blocs, such as the 
NAFTA (United States, Mexico, and Canada). 
  Drug trafficking, immigration, cultural integration, and 
regional security are priority elements on the Caribbean agenda, 
and a concerted regional effort must be made to approach these 
issues, Serbin said. 
  On Monday and Tuesday, experts from 30 countries will give 
the final touches to the draft charter of the AEC, the 
consultations of which will conclude with a ministerial meeting 
at the headquarters of the Latin American Economic System (SELA) 
on Wednesday. 
  On 4 July, in Barbados, a new integrationist bloc, with a 
gross domestic product of $500 billion, will be announced to the 
international public. Its stage will be the Caribbean Sea.

  [Text] Bonivert Claude, governor of the Central Bank of 
Haiti, denied the allegation that General Raoul Cedras withdrew 
$500,000. THE WASHINGTON POST had asserted that the head of the 
Haitian Army, Gen. Cedras, had withdrawn $500,000 from whatever 
strong currency remains in the Haitian central bank. Quoting 
government officials and members of Haitian banking circles, the 
newspaper explained that the reasons for this withdrawal were 
not clear. Claude exclaims: This is impossible! The general does 
not have an account at the Central Bank. Claude further pointed 
out that the bank is concerned with the currency problem 
affecting the Haitian financial system, and looks for a quick 
solution to this problem.

  [Text] The delegations have agreed in Norway that the Truth 
Commission should not have judicial responsibilities or 
functions, but that it should contribute to national 
reconstruction. Notisiete has had access to the details of the 
document the delegates have issued: 
  Purpose--To clarify, objectively, equitably, and 
impartially, 
the human rights violations and the deeds of violence related to 
the armed confrontation, all of which have inflicted suffering 
on the Guatemalan people. 
  Composition--The commission will consist of three members, 
the current peace negotiations moderator, whose appointment will 
be requested from the UN secretary general, a trustworthy and 
upright person, designated by the mediator, and appointed by the 
parties by consensus, and a professor selected from a three-name 
list submitted by the university rectors and approved by the 
parties by consensus. The commission will have the necessary 
support personnel who must have the required qualifications to 
perform their duties. 
  Installation and duration--The commission will be created, 
installed, and begin to function on the day an agreement for a 
firm and lasting peace is signed. The term of the commission 
will last six months, beginning from the installation of the 
commission. This period can be extended for six additional 
months if the commission so decides. 
  Reports--The commission will prepare a report, a copy of 
which will be given to the parties and the UN secretary general, 
who will release it to the public. The fact it has been 
impossible to look into every case presented to the commission 
will not detract from the value of the report. The parties 
pledge to cooperate with the commission in everything necessary 
for the duties of the commission, particularly in creating, 
before the creation of the commission and during its term of 
operation, the essential conditions for the commission to meet 
the requirements established in this agreement. 
  The commission shall prepare a report with the results of 
the 
investigations carried out during its term, including all 
factors, both internal and external. The commission shall make 
specific recommendations to pave the way for peace and national 
harmony in Guatemala. In particular, the commission shall 
recommend measures to preserve the memory of the victims to 
encourage mutual respect, preserve human rights, and reinforce 
the democratic process. The period that the commission will 
investigate will span from the beginning of the armed conflict 
to the signing of a firm and lasting peace agreement. 
  Operation--The commission will receive reports and 
information from individuals or institutions that regard 
themselves as affected. The commission must clarify these 
situations, fully and in detail, and impartially study any 
factors and circumstances that played a role in these cases. 
The commission shall invite every person who might possess 
pertinent information to present his version of the facts. The 
absence of interested individuals shall not prevent the 
commission from making a pronouncement on cases. 
  The commission's work, recommendations, and reports will not 
be the responsibility of the individual members and will not 
serve judicial purposes. The actions of the commission will 
protect the identities of the sources, as well as witnesses and 
informers. Once it is created, the commission will report on 
its composition and the location of its headquarters through 
every available means and will invite interested parties to 
present their reports and accounts. 
  According to the Framework Agreement of 10 January 1994, the 
fulfillment of this agreement is subject to international UN 
verification. The parties agree to ask the UN secretary general 
to appoint the negotiations moderator, a member of the 
commission. After he is appointed, this person will be empowered 
to carry out all of the necessary procedures to ensure the 
smooth operation of the commission once the commission is 
created and installed according to this agreement. 
  Signed in Oslo on 23 June 1994.

  [Text] Panama City, 26 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- Panamanian 
President Guillermo Endara today pardoned former Colonel Roberto 
Diaz Herrera, who precipitated the Panamanian crisis of 1987 
that culminated with the 1989 U.S. invasion. Endara issued a 
decree stating that the charges against Diaz Herrera were for 
acts of subversion and opposition to the military dictatorship 
of former General Manuel Antonio Noriega, acts which, "far from 
being dishonorable under the current democracy," should be 
described as "meritorious." 
  Diaz Herrera, who was pardoned along with seven other 
persons, including his nephew Zoroel, had been sentenced by a 
Panamanian court on 22 December 1987 to five years in prison. 
The former chief of staff of the defunct Defense Forces left 
for Venezuela following a pardon issued on 24 December 1987 by 
former President Eric Arturo Delvalle. After living in Caracas 
for a time, Diaz Herrera moved to Argentina, where he currently 
resides.

<F P=106> [Report by Raul Rodriguez and Cynthia Friedman from the </F>
"Early Morning" newscast] 
  [Text] [Rodriguez] Jorge Carpizo's resignation, which was 
announced on Friday, was followed by reactions from the 
country's various social and political forces, which voiced 
their support for Carpizo to remain in his post, particularly in 
light of the coming elections. Immediate approvals also 
followed the announcement that Carpizo will continue as head of 
the Interior Secretariat. The Institutional Revolutionary Party 
[PRI] Executive Committee and PRI presidential candidate Ernesto 
Zedillo indicated that this decision strengthens the conditions 
of legality, transparency, and impartiality vis-a-vis the coming 
elections. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] What do you think 
about Carpizo's decision to return? 
  [Zedillo] We are very pleased because it is on behalf of 
democracy. 
  [Reporter] How does the PRI view this decision? 
  [Zedillo] It is excellent. We expressed our discontent 
immediately after the announcement of his resignation and asked 
both Carpizo and President Salinas to reconsider the matter. We 
are very pleased our request was heeded. [end recording] 
  [Friedman] Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, presidential 
candidate for the National Action Party, said that Jorge 
Carpizo's decision to remain as interior secretary is 
praiseworthy. He noted that upon his return, Carpizo will have 
increased moral strength and social support. Fernandez added 
that his return will benefit democracy because Carpizo is an 
honest and highly respected man who enjoys considerable support. 
  [Rodriguez] Jorge Gonzalez Torres, presidential candidate 
for 
the Mexican Green Ecologist Party, stated that any changes made 
with regard to the Federal Electoral Institute [IFE] would crush 
whatever democratic achievements have been made. Carpizo's 
decision to remain in his post is, therefore, timely and very 
significant for Mexican politics. 
  [Friedman] Pablo Emilio Madero, presidential candidate for 
the National Opposition Union, stated that Jorge Carpizo is a 
positive element and that his work in the IFE leadership as 
interior secretary should not remain unfinished. 
  [Rodriguez] Cecilia Soto, presidential candidate for the 
Labor Party, noted that Carpizo's decision is a sign of 
confidence for the citizens and the political parties. She 
added that Carpizo's resignation would have thwarted the 
electoral reform implemented thus far and would have been a 
difficult mistake to mend. 
  [Friedman] The Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction 
Party [PFCRN], meanwhile, praised Carpizo's decision to remain 
in his post. PFCRN presidential candidate Rafael Aguilar 
Talamantes indicated that Carpizo's change of heart shows great 
patriotism, wisdom, and dignity. 
  [Rodriguez] In the meantime, the National Brotherhood of 
Christian Evangelical Churches made a respectful request for 
Carpizo to publicly denounce Mexico's enemies and those sectors 
of the party that hinder Mexico's political evolution. They 
also conveyed to Carpizo their admiration and support for him to 
remain in charge of the Interior Secretariat and the IFE.

<F P=106> [Report by Jesus Rangel M.] </F>
  [Text] The Bank of Mexico [Banxico] does not intend to 
devalue the peso in relation to the dollar or alter its monetary 
and exchange policy. In addition, the bank will handle interest 
rates, exchange rates, international monetary reserves, and 
other variables to counter exchange market speculation brought 
about by the political climate and international financial 
instability. 
  The bank says it has not changed its pledge to the Congress 
on monetary policy, according to which, at the end of the year, 
the difference between the lower and upper limits of the 
floating rate would be 13.9 percent with a daily decrease of 
0.0004 and the exchange rate would close at 3.4760 pesos. 
  Official and private sources have reported that 
international 
monetary reserves at present exceed $26 billion, more than $1.5 
billion above the figure at the end of 1993, and that reciprocal 
credits, which were granted by Canada and the United States to 
shore up Mexico's monetary stability and which are worth nearly 
$7 billion, have not yet been used up. 
  The sources said that, despite difficult circumstances, 
political concerns, in particular, the flow of foreign capital 
into the country remains constant and that this situation will 
continue as long as the macroeconomy remains steady. This has 
helped keep the interbank exchange rate within the limits of the 
central bank's intervention guidelines. 
  The bank reports that, until 11 June, government securities 
in circulation -- treasury certificates [cetes], federal 
government development bonds [bondes], treasury bonds 
[tesobonos], and adjustment bonds [ajustabonos] -- and in the 
hands of foreign investors amounted to 76.791 billion new pesos, 
the largest amount since 5 April and the equivalent of 31.81 
percent of the total. In addition, stocks of Mexican enterprises 
operating abroad continue to be bought in the stock market. 
  In the past 15 days, Banxico has countered speculation on 
the 
Mexican peso, mainly through interest rates and the issuance of 
treasury certificates and bonds for amounts below the investors' 
demand, as was observed in the most recent two auctions. 
  The Bank has allocated larger amounts of the issuances less 
in demand, those to mature in 28, 182, and 364 days. Also, the 
bank applies a mixed policy regarding interest rates; it lowers 
the rates on short-term issuances and maintains or raises them 
slightly on the issuances that mature in 182 and 364 days. A 
small amount has been made available for the more popular 
issuances, those that mature in 91 days. Furthermore, the bank 
lowers or raises the interest rate with these instruments as 
necessary to control speculation. The yield rate of treasury 
bonds has even been reduced. 
  The trend toward stability in financial markets was 
disrupted 
by Luis Donaldo Colosio's assassination on 23 March. Since then, 
the bank has used either an interest rate policy -- the Bank 
even establishes ceilings -- higher exchange rates within the 
flotation rate, monetary reserves, or other variables to deal 
with instability and speculation. 
  The sources consulted also described as wild the devaluation 
suggestions presented by economist Rudiger Dornbusch because, 
the sources said, this policy is not necessary to increase 
exports and because the dollar's devaluation regarding other 
currencies improved the competitiveness of Mexican exports to 
Europe, Asia, and Japan. 
  Banxico pointed out that its main goal is to strengthen 
monetary stability, that the effect of a devaluation would be 
more negative than positive, and that such a move would create 
considerable mistrust among the economic agents and the people 
in general. The Bank closely monitors the status of foreign 
markets and their effects on the local market in order to 
counteract any incoming turbulence, particularly because of the 
departure of large speculative capital from repercussions, in an 
operation that seeks to make quick profits, especially in 
emerging markets.

  [Text] Sao Paulo, 26 Jun (AE) -- At a news conference PT 
[Workers Party] presidential candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva 
today began to implement a strategy he had just proposed to PT 
leaders; that is, to show the people the damage the Real Plan is 
causing. Lula attacked the plan in noting that "it foments 
misery; it overlooks development, the distribution of income, 
and the creation of jobs; and it funnels social investment funds 
into the Social Emergency Fund." He also charged the economic 
team with "interfering in an absurd manner with the Judicial 
Branch" in asking regional labor courts to refrain from granting 
compensations for salary losses. 
  Lula said: "The right thing would be to first negotiate with 
the workers a basic agreement that would not result in losses 
for them." He also defended his vice presidential candidate, 
Senator Jose Paulo Bisol (Brazilian Socialist Party), who had 
proposed amendments to the federal budget that resulted in the 
allocation of a total of $8.6 million to the municipal 
government of Buritis (Minas Gerais State), where Bisol has a 
ranch. Lula said: "It is absurd to criticize a senator for 
distributing funds to municipalities. This is an entirely 
normal action." Lula added that Bisol's action "is altogether 
different" from that of Deputies Joao Alves and Ricardo Fiuza, 
who were involved in the budget scandal. He said: "Bisol is a 
friend of the mayor of Buritis. He is not like those two, who 
allocated funds to municipal governments of their electoral 
districts."

  [Text] Leaders of the United Workers Front [FUT] are 
reaffirming their decision to strike on 28 June; they say they 
do not fear the president's National Mobilization Decree, a 
decree they want repealed. They are also making the following 
demands: 
  [Begin unidentified speaker recording] We are asking the 
Supreme Court to uphold the Constitutional Guarantee Tribunal's 
decision to suspend the Agrarian Development Law. This 
demonstrates the country's true position, and it proves that the 
position of the workers and peasants from the various fronts is 
justified when they demand that the Agrarian Development Law 
approved by the National Congress be repealed. [end recording] 
  The National Teachers Union has joined the strike and is 
demanding that the freedom of education projects be suspended. 
The union is also demanding higher salaries for teachers. 
  [Begin unidentified speaker recording] The Ecuadoran 
teachers 
have listed their demands: We oppose the standard salary draft 
bill, and we are demanding higher wages and salaries in 
accordance with the law. We oppose the two hours of religious 
teaching, and we support free lay education at all levels. We 
also are demanding that the 62 teachers who have been dismissed 
unfairly be reinstated. [end recording] 
  The FUT strike has been widely criticized by politicians and 
analysts who say that the Indian situation is being exploited. 
Also, the impact of this strike, a strike that many believe is 
unjustified, must be considered at a time when most of Ecuador 
has just been returned to tranquillity.

  [Text] Santiago, 27 Jun (EFE) -- Chilean President Eduardo 
Frei today begins a two-day visit to Washington at the 
invitation of his U.S. counterpart. In view of its political and 
economic significance, President Frei has described the meeting 
as "a key visit for the future of the country." 
  Frei will meet Clinton tomorrow at the White House during a 
working meeting that encompasses a luncheon. The agenda of the 
meeting includes political and economic issues. Chilean 
Government sources have said the meeting will center on free 
trade negotiations between the two countries. 
  Diplomatic sources have said the Summit of the America, 
summoned by the U.S. Government for December in Miami, will also 
be a key issue of the meeting. 
  The Chilean president stressed that his first meeting with 
the U.S. President comes at the initiative of Clinton, adding 
that this shows Chile is "a reliable partner" for the United 
States at the political and economic level. 
  Just before his departure, Frei said the meeting "is of 
political, economic, and cultural value." After denying that 
free trade agreements will be the main issues on the agenda, 
Frei said: "we will not just discuss economic issues." 
  Frei added: "We will sit face to face with the U.S. 
President." Frei said Clinton's invitation is "a great honor, 
not just for me, but for the entire Chilean nation." 
  Frei added: "We will discuss human development, how to 
combat 
poverty; we will discuss political ethics and how Chile is 
facing this worldwide problem; and we will discuss the 
importance of achieving development and social justice on the 
basis of equality." 
  Frei said they will also discuss problems pertaining to 
women, science, and technology. 
  Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa said Frei's invitation 
"shows the U.S. political willingness to seek a rapprochement 
with Latin America." Figueroa said he believes the U.S. 
President chose Chile because "although it is a small country, 
it enjoys enough prestige and moral authority" to be a valid 
interlocutor. 
  Figueroa said Chile "has gone beyond traditional U.S.-Latin 
American ties." He said Frei is going to Washington "to propose 
ideas and to exchange points of view, not to request anything. 
All Chileans should be proud of this fact." 
  Figueroa stressed that Chile "has overcome the mendicant 
stigma that has always characterized U.S. ties with Third World 
and Latin American countries." 
  Figueroa denied that President Clinton's invitation grants 
Chile the status of a U.S. "privileged partner." He said this 
invitation shows Chile "is a reliable partner for President 
Clinton's policy of rapprochement with Latin America." 
  The Chilean foreign minister added that the meeting 
"confirms 
the spirit of rapprochement that currently prevails in the 
Americas." He said this meeting proves ties with the United 
States "are not merely based on buying-and-selling or 
borrowing-and-lending." 
  President Frei is scheduled to carry out an extensive agenda 
in Washington following his arrival on Monday. Among other 
functions, he is scheduled to meet with Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen, with AFL-CIO leaders, and attend a reception that U.S. 
Vice President Al Gore will host in his honor at the Department 
of State. 
  Before meeting Clinton, Frei will hold a working meeting 
with 
U.S. businessmen, economists, and legislators. He is also 
scheduled to meet with U.S. Trade Secretary Mickey Kantor. 
  After his meeting with Bill Clinton and before his return to 
Santiago, the Chilean president will hold a news conference.

  [Text] President Carlos Menem emphasized today that 
Argentina will not participate in a probable military 
intervention in Haiti outside UN resolutions. 
  The Argentine president guaranteed that the government will 
ask Congress for authorization if the United Nations makes a 
decision for our country to send military forces to that 
Caribbean island where a coup overthrew a democratic president 
in 1991. 
  President Carlos Menem also urged the United States to 
increase political and economic measures against Haiti's de 
facto government in order to restore the democratic system in 
that country.

  [Text] Caracas, 27 Jun (EFE) -- Venezuela will not accept 
impositions from the United States regarding Haitian refugees, 
Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas stated in remarks 
reported today. The foreign minister stressed that reports that 
the U.S. Government is forcing Venezuela to accept Haitian 
refugees are false. 
  "Venezuela is a sovereign country and does not accept 
impositions from anybody," Burelli Rivas noted, although he 
admitted his government may accept some Haitians for a brief 
period. He added that the Rafael Caldera government shares the 
concern regarding Haiti but added Venezuela has a foreign 
immigrants problem, and for that reason cannot accept any more. 
  Burelli Rivas added, however, that since Haiti is involved 
and that Venezuela is committed to searching for solutions so 
that democracy can return to that country, some Haitians may be 
allowed in for a brief period. "That was the response I gave to 
the U.S. Department of State," he indicated. 
  The top official said no Haitians have come to the 
Venezuelan 
Embassy in Port-au-Prince and added that the United States has 
two ships off the Jamaican coast to pick up Haitians and that 
only six out of 35 who requested asylum were accepted.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "What Do the Tapes Contain?"] </F>
  [Text] The cassette that has been circulating clandestinely 
among various institutions and personalities contains three 
[number as published] intercepted telephone conversations. 
  The main protagonist in the three calls seems to be Alberto 
Giraldo, a journalist who has worked for EL SIGLO, LA REPUBLICA, 
and Radio Super and who gained some notoriety when he was 
described as the spokesman of Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez 
Orejuela in 1987, a few months after the Cali trial, which ended 
with Gilberto Rodriguez' acquittal in the first public legal 
proceeding against him for drug trafficking. 
  In the three conversations, the man, who is apparently 
Giraldo, phones individuals who are apparently the Rodriguez 
Orejuela brothers to let them know of the efforts he has made 
with persons close to the Ernesto Samper and Andres Pastrana 
campaigns to negotiate a solution to the Rodriguez' case. 
  On each occasion, the person, who has been identified as 
journalist Alberto Giraldo in different circles, refers to names 
and to efforts to demand, in each case, a remuneration for 
serving as a middleman. 
<H5>  Conversation One </H5>
  In the first conversation, Giraldo phones someone who seems 
to be Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela. He asks him about the plane 
that should pick him up and then explains he has great news. 
Giraldo tells him he has spoken with Beltz and Maza Marquez 
[former presidential candidate]. 
  The person speaking with Giraldo, presumably Gilberto 
Rodriguez, anxiously asks Giraldo about the security of the line 
they are using and then asks Giraldo why he has not gotten in 
touch with "Gordo Garcia." 
  Later in the conversation, Rodriguez instructs Giraldo to 
get 
in touch with Alvaro Pava, the Conservative senator who owns 
Radio Super, so he can be brought up to date on the efforts he 
has made within Andres Pastrana's campaign. 
  At the end of conversation number one, Giraldo explains to 
Gilberto Rodriguez that he has spoken with Maza Marquez, that 
things have improved a "heck of a lot" and that the important 
thing is that they deliver the cash so that, according to what 
he implies, it can be given to Maza Marquez. 
<H5>  Conversation Two </H5>
  In the second conversation, Giraldo does not seem to be 
talking with Gilberto but with Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela. 
Giraldo begins by complaining to Miguel about several articles 
that have appeared in the newspaper LA PRENSA, whose director is 
Juan Carlos Pastrana. 
  According to the complaints, the Pastranas, through LA 
PRENSA, have accused Giraldo of being the reason why Maza 
Marquez joined Samper's campaign. 
  Immediately thereafter Giraldo explains to Rodriguez that 
"Eduardo," who from the context of the conversation would appear 
to be Eduardo Mestre, urgently needs money and Rodriguez 
explains that in fact "Eduardo" already sent an envoy to them. 
  The revelation worries Giraldo, who finally asked Rodriguez 
who the envoy was, to which Rodriguez responded that it was 
Villegas (during the same conversation he was identified as 
Cesar Villegas). 
  Both [Giraldo and Villegas] are named in the conversation as 
alleged intermediaries between the Samper campaign and the 
Rodriguez Orejuela's. Moreover, the person who is seemingly 
Miguel Rodriguez reveals that he had also received telephone 
calls from "Medina" and he asks Giraldo to be calm and discreet 
and to not discuss this matter with "Eduardo." 
  "Medina," who elsewhere in the conversation is referred to 
as 
Santi," seems in reality to be Santiago Medina, Samper's 
campaign treasurer. 
  Due to the tone of the conversation, the person believed to 
be Miguel Rodriguez questions his caller regarding the safety of 
the telephone line and later explains that efforts must be 
conducted on various fronts. 
  Giraldo insists on the importance of five points, among them 
several important appointments which, he said, must be 
guaranteed. 
  Later in the conversation Giraldo asks what he must tell 
"Medina," and Rodriguez instructs him to explain that the money 
will be sent in two payments as they had agreed. 
  Further on, Giraldo confirms to Miguel Rodriguez that 
Samper's victory is in his hands and he denies what appears to 
be an assertion by "Medina" to the effect that the Santo Domingo 
Group was prepared to contribute to Samper's campaign all the 
money it needed. According to Giraldo, the campaign needed 5 
billion and has only received 2 billion, apparently from the 
Santo Domingo Group. Rodriguez explains to Giraldo that the 
remaining 3 billion are ready and the cartel can deliver them 
without any difficulties. 
  In response to this assertion, Giraldo complains there was 
nothing in it for him, to which Rodriguez responds that he is 
not the candidate nor does he have 47 percent of the vote. 
Giraldo later insists on receiving a bonus for the efforts he 
presumably made and Rodriguez tells him that if Samper wins the 
cartel will give him a bonus. However, he prohibited Giraldo 
from making separate requests to the two alleged Rodriguez' and 
two other powerful drug traffickers in Valle. 
  Later, reference is made to Maza's campaign concerning the 
fact that it was a good thing he only garnered 60,000 of an 
expected 100,000 votes, adding that therein lies the importance 
of the [Rodriguez'] efforts. He was apparently referring to 
40,000 votes that might go to Samper. 
  To conclude, they discussed "Eduardo," apparently Eduardo 
Mestre Sarmiento, and Villegas; Rodriguez complained of the 
meager results that usually characterize efforts with "Eduardo" 
and Giraldo tells him that "Eduardo" had already met with the 
two top men of the campaign and that what matters is the 
existence of an agreement that will be fulfilled.

  [Text] People can no longer tolerate the ups and downs of 
economic stabilization plans. This rejection was emphasized in 
last week's poll by InformEstado, which revealed that 82 percent 
of those polled want the next government to continue with the 
real plan. Only 6 percent want the plan discontinued, while 12 
percent said they did not know what they want. Among those who 
support continuation of the plan, irrespective of who wins the 
presidential elections, the majority (65 percent) believe that 
the next president should respect the plan in its entirety, 
while only 17 percent said that the plan should be only 
partially continued. 
  There is considerable support for the plan: 68 percent of 
those polled back the real. Support for the real increases 
among members of higher social classes, going from 50 percent 
for class D to 82 percent for class A. By age, the plan 
obtained its strongest support from people between 41 and 50. 
The lower the educational level, the higher the indifference 
and the higher the number of people claiming to be "neither 
against nor in favor." 
  For 58 percent of those polled, the plan will succeed -- 
although partially -- as was noted by 32 percent of this group. 
Pessimistic answers were given by 26 percent, who said the plan 
will fail (16 percent do not know). Despite the optimism 
concerning the plan, the people polled were entirely distrustful 
when asked about price increases. The majority -- 72 percent -- 
believe that prices will continue to increase. Expectations 
over government-set prices are not better: 58 percent believe 
the government will also continue to increase prices.

  [Text] Brasilia, 27 Jun (AE) -- The Brazilian Government 
today turned down requests submitted last weekend for export 
licenses for a total of 1 million sacks of coffee. With this 
move, the government expects to stop speculation on the 
international market and to reduce abusive prices on the 
domestic market. Coffee producers are apparently taking 
advantage of the frost that has in recent days been affecting 
the coffee producing regions in the states of Parana, Sao Paulo, 
and Minas Gerais to increase their prices. Coffee price 
increases have been a factor in increasing the June inflation 
rate. 
  Frederico Robalinho de Barros, secretary for commercial 
policy at the Industry and Commerce Ministry, believes the 
coffee price increase could jeopardize the implementation of the 
real on 1 July. The New York Stock Exchange today opened with an 
increase of 49 cents per pound, representing a 42-percent 
increase compared to the price on 24 June. Coffee prices have 
also increased markedly at the London Stock Exchange, where on 
24 June the price stood at $2,230 per tonne but today rose to 
$2,980 per tonne; that is, a 33- percent increase. 
  The government has confirmed that in only three days -- 25, 
26, and 27 June -- coffee exporters have requested licenses to 
export 1 million sacks. This is a much larger volume than what 
was exported for the entire month of May. Within three days, 
government experts will survey the affected coffee plantations 
to assess the damages provoked by the frost last weekend. 
Ailton Barcellos, executive secretary of the Industry and 
Commerce Ministry, said: "Preliminary assessments indicate that 
coffee production may have been damaged to a level of between 30 
and 35 percent in Parana State." Robalinho said that losses in 
other regions may not go beyond 10 percent. 
  Robalinho announced that the government will have the damage 
assessment reports by 4 July. Barcellos said: "When we have 
this data we will be able to reopen the export registries." 
Barcellos added that "there were an overwhelming number of 
export license requests during the weekend." Showing 
indignation, Robalinho said: "These were stupid requests." He 
added that "within four to five days we will have reports on the 
extent of the damage." Earlier, Robalinho had met with leaders 
of the Brazilian Federation of Coffee Exporters (Febrae). 
  To avert abuse and speculation, the government today issued 
two decrees that will be published tomorrow (28 June) in the 
DIARIO OFICIAL DA UNIAO. The first decree temporarily suspends 
export licenses for soluble coffee that had been granted on the 
basis of the 24 June prices (Friday), and turned down all 
petitions submitted today to export coffee at today's prices. 
The second decree suspends the export of coffee beans and 
cancels all export licenses issued on the basis of prices 
prevailing on 24 and 27 June. 
  To contain price increases on the domestic market, the 
government plans to sell part of its coffee buffer stock, which 
is estimated at 17.5 million sacks. It is estimated that the 
1994-95 coffee harvest will yield 22 million sacks.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Brazil monitored through 23 
June. 
<H5>  TRADE BALANCE </H5>
  Imports in May rose by 86.96 percent with respect to the 
same 
month in 1993, increasing from $1.587 billion to $2.967 billion. 
Exports grew by 32.35 percent, rising from $2.918 billion in May 
1993 to $3.862 billion in May 1994. In the same period the 
balance of trade registered a 32.76 percent drop, going from 
$1.331 billion to $895 million. According to Ailton Barcellos, 
executive secretary of the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and 
Tourism, monthly imports averaged $2.138 billion in 1993. 
Imports in May 1994 were 27.94 percent higher than the 1993 
average monthly figure. Barcellos reported that between January 
and May 1994, exports and imports reached $16.373 billion 
$11.174 billion respectively, accounting for a growth of 7.81 
and 24.95 percent respectively if compared with the figures for 
the same period in 1993. The trade balance surplus was thus 
$5.199 billion, which is 16.74 percent smaller than the figure 
for the same period in 1993. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in 
Portuguese 2125 GMT 24 Jun 94) 
<H5>  REVENUES </H5>
  Federal tax revenues amounted to almost $4.9 billion in May. 
In real terms this figure is 1.1 percent smaller than the 
revenues collected in the same period of 1993. Compared to 
April 1994, May revenues dropped by 7.7 percent. Between 
January and May 1994, tax revenues amounted to almost $24.1 
billion. This figure is 24.4 percent larger than the figure 
registered for the same period in 1993. (Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE 
SAO PAULO in Portuguese 17 Jun 94 p B6) 
  Between January and May 1994, Goods and Services 
Distribution 
Tax (ICMS) revenues yielded $1.15 billion in Minas Gerais. This 
figure is, in real terms, 14.23 percent higher than the figure 
for the same period in 1993. Compared to April, revenues rose 
by 14.14 percent. According to a study by the Minas Gerais 
Finance Secretariat on ICMS revenues in 1990, they dropped 21.16 
percent in Minas Gerais in 1990, while in Sao Paulo ICMS 
revenues dropped by 29.7 percent, in Santa Catarina 30.3 
percent, in Rio de Janeiro 20.57 percent, in Bahia 21.07 
percent, and in Rio Grande do Sul 22.13 percent. Compared to 
1990, ICMS revenues in Minas Gerais dropped in 1993, from $3.29 
billion to $2.6 billion. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in 
Portuguese 21 Jun 94 p 5) 
<H5>  DOMESTIC INVESTMENT </H5>
  The stock of traditional bank investments -- bank deposit 
certificates, funds, and savings -- dropped by $2.2 billion in 
the first 15 days of June. The National Association of Open 
Market Institutions claims that investment in bank deposit 
certificates dropped by $2.2 billion, while according to the 
National Association of Investment and Development Banks fund 
investment dropped by $1.5 billion. In turn, savings deposits 
grew by $1.5 billion. The investment drop was caused by 
increased demand for black market dollars, which according to 
the ING Bank accounted for a drain of $800 million in the first 
half of June. Open market institutions themselves have also 
increased their government security purchases. This drop in 
traditional investment sectors, which amounts to 0.5 percent of 
GDP, is considered to be a consequence of the currency change 
scheduled for 1 July. (Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in 
Portuguese 20 Jun 94 Economy and Business Section p 1) 
<H5>  DOMESTIC DEBT </H5>
  The Central Bank, BC, reported on 20 June that the Brazilian 
Government's debt in securities, which currently stands at 
$57.19 billion, increased by 49.84 percent between May 1993 and 
May 1994. This debt accounts for 10.2 percent of GDP, which has 
been estimated at 1.047 quadrillion cruzeiros. The BC also 
reports that its own debt in securities totals $32.97 billion, 
and that the debt in securities of state and municipal 
governments increased from 606 billion cruzeiros to 34.92 
trillion cruzeiros between May 1993 and May 1994, representing a 
23.02 percent increase in real terms. The debt of the state of 
Sao Paulo alone increased from 225 billion to 13.36 trillion 
cruzeiros -- that is, a 26.77 percent increase in real terms. 
The city of Sao Paulo has had the largest increase during this 
period, with its debt increasing from 29 billion to 2.67 
trillion cruzeiros, or a 96.52 percent increase in real terms. 
(Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 21 Jun 94 p 22) 
  Mines and Energy Minister Alexis Stepanenko has reported 
that 
after four years of negotiations between the Brazilian Electric 
Power Company, Inc. (Eletrobras) and its suppliers, the Finance 
Ministry has authorized the National Treasury to allocate $800 
million to pay for Eletrobras' debts to its suppliers. The due 
debt already totals $780 million, $550 million of which will be 
paid for with certificates issued by the National Treasury. 
(Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2337 GMT 22 Jun 94) 
<H5>  EXPORTS </H5>
  Antartica, one of the main beer breweries of Brazil, is 
expanding its international operations. Besides the $15 million 
it expects to earn this year with its exports to 16 countries, 
nearly 40 percent more than that in 1993, it expects to increase 
its guarana syrup exports to its franchiser in the PRC, the 
Weijia Group, which is currently selling 1 million cans of 
guarana soft drinks per month in Zhuhai Province in the PRC. 
Antartica expects Weijia to increase its production to 3 
million cans per month in Zhuhai Province in the PRC. (Sao 
Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2203 GMT 20 Jun 94) 
<H5>  FOREIGN RESERVES </H5>
  Government reserves in dollars again reached record levels 
at 
the end of April, although that month the government had to 
disburse $2.88 billion for the purchase of U.S. Government 
certificates as a guarantee to creditor banks for new Brazilian 
certificates. According to the Central Bank, the reserves 
totalled $38.289 billion in April and were fully available. In 
March these reserves totalled $38.282 billion. (Sao Paulo FOLHA 
DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 21 Jun 94 Section 1 p 10) 
<H5>  IMPORT TAXES </H5>
  President Itamar Franco has reduced to zero the 25 percent 
of 
the Financial Operations Tax that companies installed in Brazil 
had to pay to import technology. Franco's decree was published 
in the 22 June issue of the DIARIO OFICIAL. According to Jose 
Roberto D'Affonseca Gusmao, president of the National Institute 
of Industrial Property, this decree will stimulate the purchase 
of foreign technology. The decision to reduce this tax to zero 
was based on reports by the ministers of finance and of 
industry, commerce, and tourism. Last year, Brazil paid $240 
million abroad for patent permits, brands, technical assistance, 
and technology transfer. Gusmao added that this amount is too 
small for a country such as Brazil, and shows that the companies 
were evading taxes. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 23 
Jun 94 p 3) 
<H5>  BANKRUPTCIES </H5>
  During the second week in June, 11 construction companies 
have gone bankrupt in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. This number 
represents an 83.3 percent increase over the preceding week, and 
a certain stability compared to the second week in May. In May, 
27 construction companies went bankrupt, but in April their 
number totaled only 20. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in 
Portuguese 19 Jun 94 p 19) 
  During the third week in June, 27 companies working with 
foodstuffs have gone bankrupt in the states of Rio de Janeiro 
and Sao Paulo. This number represents a 42.1 percent increase 
compared to the preceding week, and a 68.7 percent increase 
compared to the third week in May. During the month of May, 63 
such companies went bankrupt, and during the month of April 77. 
(Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 21 Jun 94 p 35) 
<H5>  SAO PAULO EMPLOYMENT </H5>
  The wave of dismissals that has been observed in Sao Paulo 
industries over the past five months has been interrupted by the 
hiring of 288 workers. In practice this represents stability in 
the employment levels, with a 0.01 percent variation. According 
to the Sao Paulo State Federation of Industries (FIESP) so far 
51,532 workers have been laid off this year in Sao Paulo, making 
the employment level drop by 2.19 percent. Over the last 12 
months the employment level has dropped by 3.5 percent, 
representing 83,295 dismissals. The employment rate in Sao 
Paulo State has been negative since October 1993. (Sao Paulo 
AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 1505 GMT 20 Jun 94) 
<H5>  SERVICES </H5>
  Beginning 10 July, one of the DC-10 planes of the Rio Grande 
do Sul Airline, Varig, will be painted with the colors of the 
Uruguayan airline, Pluna. The first stage of the agreement for 
the Brazilian company to begin administering Pluna has thus 
begun. Before the end of the year another Varig DC-10 plane 
will be transferred to Pluna. According to the Varig board, 
Pluna will pay Varig for administering the company. Varig 
President Rubel Thomas said that this proof of Varig's strength 
in the Latin American market will make the Export-Import Bank 
sensitive to the company's reorganization plan, which involves 
leasing operations. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese

  [Text] The PRC health minister is discussing the sale of 
PRC-made medicine to the country with Brazilian officials. The 
cost of these medicines is low, particularly because they are 
produced in large amounts. 
  [Begin Flavio Figueiredo recording] Brazil may import 
medicines from the PRC. The issue was discussed on 23 June by 
PRC Health Minister Chen Minzhang and Brasilia Health Ministry 
representatives. The Chinese assert that the medicines will 
reach Brazil at prices much lower than those on the local market. 
  According to Minister Chen Minzhang, the PRC produces 
medicines at a lower cost because the country manufactures them 
in huge quantities and has high technology for obtaining raw 
material. 
  Adinei Moraes, Health Assistance Secretariat chief of staff, 
said importing would be an alternative way of solving the 
problem of high medicine prices in Brazil. He added that this is 
why the government is analyzing the PRC proposal's feasibility.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar commented this 
morning on his recent trip: 
  [Begin Aranibar recording] I recently attended a meeting in 
Paraguay of foreign ministers of the Urupabol [Permanent Joint 
Commission of Uruguay, Paraguay, and Bolivia]. The meeting was 
held on 24 and 25 June in Asuncion, Paraguay. A joint 
declaration will be released to the media. I would like to 
point out two aspects: The meeting was the first effort of 
countries of least development, like landlocked Paraguay and 
Bolivia, to coordinate an exchange of views and eventually 
develop mutually beneficial actions. The three countries 
expressed their support for the efforts by the Fonplata [River 
Plate Basin Development Fund] to improve its financial 
conditions and thus contribute to the development of the three 
countries. The three foreign ministers confirmed their full 
support for the continuation of the Fonplata Permanent 
Secretariat in Sucre, Bolivia. This issue created concern among 
institutions and the Civic Committee of the Chuquisaca 
Department which lead to a commitment by the Foreign Ministry 
and the government to maintain the permanent secretariat 
headquarters in Sucre. The declaration contains support by 
Uruguay and Paraguay for the continuation of the permanent 
secretariat headquarters in Sucre, Bolivia. [end recording] 
  That was Foreign Minister Aranibar's comments on his recent 
trip to Paraguay to attend the Urupabol meeting.

  [Text] New charges of corruption have been made. A high 
percentage of the $20 million that has been seized since 1988 
has been a source for many people to get rich illegally. 
  The government points at members of the Special 
Antinarcotics 
Force [FELCN], trustees, and former lieutenant governors as 
those who are involved in corruption. Two private law 
consulting firms and the government have detected a framework of 
corruption in the country, which has been operating for a long 
time. The poor and criminal administration of the assets 
confiscated from drug traffickers has led to the appearance in 
Bolivian society of illegal fortunes, according to an official 
document. 
  Since 1988 until 6 August 1993, millions of U.S. dollars 
seized from drug trafficking have disappeared due to the 
negligent and guilty actions of the FELCN and people who were 
appointed by the Attorney General's Office as trustees of the 
assets. Former lieutenant governors in the rural areas have 
also been involved.

<F P=106> [Interview with Juan de la Cruz Willka, assistant secretary </F>
general of the Bolivian Labor Federation, in "Friday Dialogue"; 
place and date not given] 
  [Text] Since the creation of the General Trade Union 
Confederation of Peasant Workers of Bolivia (CSUTCB), the 
indigenous-peasant movement has gained greater influence in the 
country. This accounts for the fact that, for example, the vice 
president of the Republic is an Aymara and that in the trade 
union field, the peasants have proposed that the Bolivian Labor 
Federation (COB) try to bring itself into line with the national 
reality. 
  Prior to the 10th Congress of the COB, to be opened at the 
end of May, the secretary general of that organization, Juan de 
la Cruz Willka, as representative of the CSUTCB, was invited to 
"Friday Dialogue" to describe the expectations in that area and 
to provide a general view of the peasant movement. 
  Willka (48 years old) was born in the community of 
Chachacumani, Pantaleon Dalente de Oruro Province, although he 
points out that he was really born in Ayllu Thaya Kira. He has 
had a very active political and trade union career and is 
considered one of the leading representatives of those who want 
the COB to make a qualitative leap forward and include among its 
principles the struggle of the indigenous nations. 
  [PRESENCIA] One subject under discussion is how 
representative the different sectors of the COB are. What is the 
position of the peasants in that regard? 
  [Willka] In two previous congresses of the COB, we 
maintained 
that the organic structure of the COB and of the Executive 
Committee should express the national reality. That is to say, 
diversity, the class struggle and the struggle of the indigenous 
nations. 
  At the moment, they are expressions only of the class 
struggle and not of the struggle of the indigenous nations. That 
is why it is a classist structure. 
  We have made some progress, they have already given us the 
General Secretariat. In the Congress of Chuquisaca, the CSUTCB 
proposed this as the political thesis of the COB, but the 
salaried workers ratified their political thesis and a classist 
structure, as a guarantee, they said, of the revolution. Our 
thesis proposes instead that the class struggle and the struggle 
of the indigenous nations are based on the same thing. 
  [PRESENCIA] To what do you attribute the resistance against 
accepting the peasants' thesis? 
  [Willka] To an ideological conception. They describe us 
peasants as petit bourgeoisie because we own a piece of land. 
They say that all property owners, according to their analysis, 
are not to be trusted, and therefore we are petit bourgeoisie. 
  We reject that assertion. We are not a part of the petit 
bourgeoisie because we own a piece of land. There is an 
ideological background here that is very deeply rooted, and that 
I want to explain. 
  In both ideological beliefs, that of the socialist states of 
the former Soviet Union and that of capitalism, land is 
considered an economic asset that must be exploited to obtain 
economic benefits. Therefore, anyone who possesses land--one or 
several hectares--possesses wealth and can improve his standard 
of living. 
  Based on our Andean ideological conception, land is not an 
economic asset; the land is part of mankind. If land did not 
exist, we believe that man could not live, because where could 
we produce rice, yucca, potatoes, bananas; where could we graze 
our livestock? Therefore, for us land is part of the life of 
mankind and of humanity, and it must be cared for, just like 
human life, so that it serves humanity and not, as in other 
proposals, that the land must be squeezed dry, as socialism and 
capitalism have always done. 
  From that starting point, we reject those philosophies that 
say that any proprietor is a bourgeois. 
  Furthermore, in Bolivian practice, if we compare a peasant 
and a salaried worker, which one is better off economically? A 
worker might have his radio, his television, he has his tea, he 
dresses well, etc., and a peasant from north Potosi is dressed 
in rags and can barely feed himself. 
  Therefore, it is impossible to believe that we are petit 
bourgeoisie, and we think that they are wrong to analyze only on 
the basis of a philosophy that Marx brought to us, which is 
valid, but in a different situation, and Europe is a different 
situation that is very far away. 
  We should take these errors into account and direct 
ourselves, based on our cultural roots, toward a structure and 
ideology of the COB. 
  [PRESENCIA] How should the COB be structured, according to 
that position? 
  [Willka] By taking into account its societal base. The 
societal expression of this country comes primarily from the 
indigenous nations: Aymaras, Quechuas, Guaranies, and other 
nations. They should have a real representation inside the COB. 
  The other sectors also have their social expressions: the 
salaried workers, among them, as always, the miners, factory 
workers, etc.; the trade unions and other sectors that must be 
represented. 
  In reality, neither peasants nor factory workers nor miners 
should be privileged. Nobody. The privileged should be some 
distinguished leader who has been proven in the struggle, in his 
honesty, in his preparation; this kind of person should be our 
leadership in the COB. If they are miners, good for the miners; 
if they are from other sectors, the same goes for them. This is 
what we believe. 
  [PRESENCIA] At present, the executive secretary is elected 
by 
a workers' vanguard, in this case, the miners.... 
  [Willka] Who constitutes the vanguard is a subject that is 
under discussion. Why were the miners the vanguard? Because of 
their struggle, more than anything else, since the beginning of 
the trade union movement, which aimed at the defeat of the 
mining oligarchy and afterward continued the struggle. This is 
what gave it the label of vanguard. In those days there was 
class consciousness because the miners were not employees of a 
state enterprise; they were employees of private enterprise and, 
being private enterprise, class consciousness at that time was 
stronger than attachment to a job. They left their jobs and 
fought for change. I believe this is what made them strong. 
  However, now it seems that workers do not have sufficient 
class consciousness. Let us see which worker would decide to 
leave his job for the struggle. None. They prefer to keep their 
jobs, even with a miserable salary, and not give up their jobs 
and embark on the struggle. This shows that class consciousness 
has decreased and that one is just another worker. I believe 
that this is what is happening now. 
  [PRESENCIA] On the other hand, are the peasant leaders 
ready, 
in a trade union sense, to lead the COB? 
  [Willka] I think that...some time ago, I said that I did not 
know how we could qualify, whether we would all have to take an 
examination. It is always that way, it is also ideological: "The 
peasants are not ready yet." We have not been ready for 500 
years, but when will we be? I believe that this is the question. 
I believe that no one has ever taken on a responsibility, 
already knowing everything. It is a matter of initiative, of a 
person's decision to assume responsibility. 
  [PRESENCIA] Getting back to the sectors, which ones have 
received the proposal most favorably? 
  [Willka] The miners agreed to discuss it, to think it over. 
Those who do not want to hear of it are the Troskyites, who 
accuse us of being back in the Middle Ages. The teachers agree. 
But let us be clear: It will not be the miners or the factory 
workers or the teachers who decide not to go along, but the 
professional politicians, such as the Trotskyites. But I do not 
believe that they represent all of the teachers. We would be 
wrong, then, to say that they do not accept us. 
  [PRESENCIA] In your view what is the outlook for the 10th 
Congress of the COB? 
  [Willka] There are going to be problems along the lines 
indicated by this discussion, and everyone will want to speak 
his mind. But I believe that there is maturity at the sector 
level. I believe that in spite of these problems, the COB is 
going to go forward, as it has always done. We will form the 
Executive Committee, whoever might be on it, because there is no 
way to calculate that. The workers say "so many of us have 
died," and we wish we were able to count how many of us have 
died; we have millions of dead, not only during this period but 
since the arrival of the Spaniards. 
  [PRESENCIA] You no longer believe in vanguards? 
  [Willka] Not any more. The vanguard should include all the 
workers, from the smallest to the biggest, without preferences. 
  [PRESENCIA] How long will the CSUTCB last if they do not 
listen to you? 
  [Willka] We have realized that, having the secretary 
general, 
having the executive, has resolved nothing. We have to think 
about making a political move; leaving the trade union struggle 
to move on to a political struggle. The union movement is a form 
of struggle, but it is others who wield power, and all our lives 
we have been fools and nothing more. That is why I say that if 
they do not give us, let us say, the executive, with a factory 
worker executive, with a miner executive, or with whomever, the 
peasants are going to continue offering up their lives, as in 
this latest conflict. Let the peasants win the executive, we are 
the ones who weep and die. That is the problem. Therefore, we 
will continue on that road. 
  [PRESENCIA] What will be the principal disagreements at the 
10th Congress of the COB? 
  [Willka] In reality, they will be between the official 
position and those who do not share the official position, but 
not so much a function of party but of concept, of the thinking 
in each sector. I say that their proposal is bad because they 
want to destroy the communities. By means of municipalization, 
the indigenous communities--we have been independent, so 
far--are now going to be dependents of popular participation. I 
do not agree with that because it really means we will all be 
the same. The new configuration of municipalities is going to 
break up entire communities of ours. I do not agree with that 
policy, and the official position is going to be one of 
agreement. The fight, then, will be along those lines. 
  They will tell us that we are going to collect rural land 
taxes through the municipalities, and some will say yes, we will 
say no. Therefore, there are two different opinions. 
  [PRESENCIA] Will the other conflict be between the classist 
concept and that of a nation? 
  [Willka] I believe...we will see. I am calculating that no 
one will be opposed to it; I believe that everyone will sign 
on--even earlier they recognized the struggle of the 
nationalities in some manner. I do not believe anyone is going 
to deny that. I do not believe that this feeling exists in this 
Congress. 
  During the Congress on Bolivian Education, which was held by 
the official sector, the COB, and the church, we all agreed that 
to educate the children is to construct a state that is 
multicultural, multinational, and socialist. (The socialist did 
not please many, but we explained that this was intended in a 
communitarian sense because, in the end, there cannot be a 
pretty little multicultural state which is also capitalist, and 
because what we are aiming for is that there should be equity.) 
  [PRESENCIA] Organically, also? 
  [Willka] There it will be different. I think it will be 
difficult. There are going to be arguments, walk-outs, that kind 
of thing.... I at least am coming to the realization that it 
will still be a very serious problem. 
<H5>  [Box, p 2] </H5>
<H5>  The Difficult Relationship Between Leadership and Peasant </H5>
Grass Roots 
  [PRESENCIA] The CSUTCB has entered and is still suffering 
from a very severe crisis due to ideological conflict and 
corruption. Why are there so many problems and what is being 
done to resolve them? 
  [Willka] The crisis is due more than anything to the 
political positions of the peasant leaders. I would say that 
there are three positions. One, racist, which says that the only 
solution is finishing off the Creoles [q'aras]. Another, very 
clever, is the social democratic position which, starting out 
from peasant initiatives, has taken root, not directly as social 
democracy, but as a proposal vindicating the rights of the 
peasants. The third current position proposes neither racism nor 
classism. We say that it is not possible for the class struggle 
and the struggle of the indigenous nations to be separated or 
even allied, but they must be a single thing, without it 
disturbing anyone, and that is what is happening, to a certain 
extent. These factions have confronted one another to take over 
the leadership of the trade union movement, but I think that the 
conflict is a thing of the past. 
  The last conflict was due to the fact that the social 
democrats of the MBL [Free Bolivia Movement] wanted complete 
domination over the CSUTCB, so that it would serve as the 
political cushion of the current government; its leaders wanted 
to hang on and there we fought it out, we made a problem out of 
it. 
  At last, there is unity now through communitarian trade 
union 
democracy, which means that he who won has won, and nothing 
more. This is where the political maturity of the comrade 
delegates who attended the congress was demonstrated. They had 
to elect a comrade peasant who expresses both ideas, Comrade 
Felix Santos, who is a genuine peasant. 
  Evidently, they are not happy about this, they keep 
complaining, there are many loud complaints from many sides, but 
in any case, the crisis we were suffering has been resolved at 
the leadership level, but only partly at the grass roots. The 
leadership has influence, but the grass roots are a different 
story. 
  [PRESENCIA] What is going on at the peasant grass roots? 
  [Willka] The grass roots are structured differently. There 
are trade unions, indigenous authorities, cooperatives, and 
associations, there are many forms of organization. The 
principal authorities in the communities are the trade unions 
and the indigenous authorities, and the others (cooperatives, 
associations) are the economic branches of those authorities. 
  We lack sufficient communication with the grass roots to 
keep 
them well-informed. It is very hard to reach everywhere. In that 
regard, the best organized are the miners, the workers. They 
work together, at the blow of a whistle they have a meeting, 
while with us.... 
  [PRESENCIA] How would you describe the different positions 
in 
the peasant movement? 
  [Willka] It depends on the problems of each community, each 
sector, and each region. 
  Those most affected by neoliberal policies and foreign 
political interference recently have been the coca leaf growers. 
They have had very serious problems. A coca grower is constantly 
afraid that the UMOPAR [Mobile Rural Patrol Unit) will seize his 
house, ransack it, and leave a kilo of cocaine, and say 
afterward that they found it there; it is really serious. In 
addition, the eradication of the coca plantations has hurt. It 
is as if a comrade on the altiplano had his crops destroyed by 
someone. Anyone would get angry. This is why the coca growers 
have really radicalized their struggle. 
  It is the same on the altiplano: everyone has become 
radicalized over the tax on rural property and against 
commercialization of the land, which is a very sore subject for 
the peasants. These problems come up and the comrades become 
radicalized, they fight. 
  With regard to extreme poverty, there are many approaches. 
Many comrades believe that the government is going to save them 
when they experience hardship and that is why they tend, let us 
say, to suffer hunger. That happens because they think that the 
government might help them to improve their situation, and they 
allow themselves to be used. This is a problem that we have been 
unable to remedy so far. 
  This is why there are questions: although everyone is united 
in the struggle of the indigenous nations over land, taxes, 
etc., no one is united when it comes to elections. Instead, 
everyone casts his vote for a political choice contrary to his 
interests, believing that the government is going to take care 
of his problem. 
<H5>  [Box, p 2] </H5>
<H5>  If the COB's Business Was Conducted in Aymara! </H5>
  Willka's ideas about the need for change in the COB are not 
new. He proposed them some six years ago, together with other 
peasant leaders. Nevertheless, there are problems of 
communication. 
  "Even I have a problem," he admits. "It is not possible for 
an urban teacher, let us say, to grasp it because my language is 
different from his. I was born speaking Aymara, and I learned 
Castilian at age 12. This is why our way of expressing ourselves 
and of interpreting things holds us peasants back." 
  He explains that as Castilian is the language in which the 
COB's business is conducted "we sometimes do not make ourselves 
understood, but if discussions in the 10th Congress of the COB 
are going to be in Aymara, Quechua, then the other sectors will 
have interpreters, but they will not be able to explain to us 
with perfect clarity what they are thinking. This, in fact, is 
our problem, and it is present in all of the meetings." 
  And it has consequences: "There are some concepts that 
sometimes I really have to go to the dictionary to look up, and 
the following day it dawns on me. Oh hell, that is what was 
said, and all this time I did not understand!" 
<H5>  Hard To Change </H5>
  In addition, Willka says that there is a deeply rooted 
working class ideology in the cities that is hard to change and 
that can be seen, "for example, in May Day parades, which are 
completely working class. The peasants in the department of La 
Paz customarily march on that day. There were more than 5,000 
comrade peasants in the last parade. What newspaper coverage did 
they receive? None. Not even a tiny photograph. There were some 
50-100 miners with their little picks, and they came out in a 
front page photo. It seems that the press is also working class. 
That is all right. These things happen. They still do not want 
to understand, it is like passing from one set of customs to 
another, from one way of life to another; it is hard." 
  This situation is reflected in the COB. Willka says that "if 
a peasant was the executive of the COB, I do not know whether 
the workers would maintain their affiliation, they might decide 
to disaffiliate because the roots are very strong, the class 
struggle is very deeply rooted." 
<H5>  [Box, p 2] </H5>
<H5>  Politics and Peasants </H5>
  The peasant movement has experienced many changes of 
fortune. 
It had gained much strength by 1952 but gradually lost it later 
until, with the creation of the CSUTCB, an equivocal period of 
crisis began. 
  Willka explains this phenomenon, recognizing that "our 
thinking was different before 1952. We did not even understand 
the problem of the land. The MNR [National Revolutionary 
Movement] said that it was going to give us land, as though they 
had brought the land with them; we did not know that the land 
was ours, that our history was hidden in darkness. Now, all of 
the peasants are obliged to think things through." 
  He believes that with the foundation of the CSUTCB in 1979, 
"matters are becoming much clearer, the current leaders are more 
open." 
  "But we have still not been able to escape or deal with the 
political manipulation that exists in the country. They have 
manipulated us very easily, for example: The `Goni' [typical 
member of an indigenous nation] has become aware of the 
political accumulation of the past 500 years. On 12 October 1992 
we were feeling very strong and right away an Aymara comes 
along--Victor Hugo Cardenas--to be co-opted, and in the end he 
ruined us politically. In other words, the indigenous nations 
were a real answer for many people, but when they saw an Aymara 
make common cause with the Creoles, they no longer trusted the 
Aymaras." 
  This is why he is convinced that Cardenas's decision was a 
severe blow. "We want to go forward with our own leaders. The 
people have been trusting, there have been the 500 years of 
Aymaras, Quechuas, and with their mobilization, we felt united, 
we could do things, our grass roots believed that now we were 
strong and people believed that `these leaders are raising us 
up.' We even used to say that the workers, that this or that 
sector, had betrayed us, when someone of our own blood sold 
himself out to the neoliberal political leadership." 
  "What do the people at the grass roots think? That their 
leaders always betray them, there is the Aymara who sold out. I 
think that Victor Hugo lent himself to that game. If he had not, 
he would certainly not be in the government, but perhaps he 
would have had a position of such prestige as to be able to 
lead, just like Mandela in South Africa, who showed us that this 
kind of thing is possible." 
  "Imperialism has very cleverly created a problem for us. 
Before, it killed us to keep us quiet, now it co-opts us and 
makes us distrust our own leaders. Who is going to believe me 
now? I travel among the indigenous nations, I talk, but people 
are thinking `this one is just using us to get ahead. Tomorrow 
or the next day he will surely sell out, just like Victor Hugo.' 
This is what has happened, and it is very serious." 
  Nevertheless, asked whether the influence of the political 
parties in the peasant movement is harmful, Willka says no. "It 
was harmful before, but lately it is not very important, because 
who are they influencing? On the one hand, there is the official 
sector (MNR, MRTKL [Tupac Katari Revolutionary Movement], UCS 
[Solidarity Civic Union], MBL [Free Bolivian Movement]); on the 
other, the groups represented in the union leadership, the ASD 
[Social Democratic Alliance] and the Pachakuti axis," but he 
says that it was decided to leave aside party labels and enter 
the struggle of class and nation. "That is, first I am a 
peasant, and I am expressing myself this way. This is at the 
trade union level. Second, I myself feel that I must perform a 
political task for the liberation of the people. It would seem 
that these are very exaggerated arguments that the political 
parties are using. I do not feel manipulated nor am I a 
manipulator, because I am part of the political leadership." 
  "I do not believe that there is anyone in the COB.... Who 
could politically impose a given leader? I do not think that 
way. There must be very little of that now. That is how it was 
before. It was said that, politically, this one must be a 
leader, and everyone had to support him, but no longer." 
<H5>  [Box, p 2] </H5>
<H5>  Production, Culture and Consciousness, Origins of the </H5>
Peasant Crisis 
  The ever more important presence of peasants in the various 
social and political movements is explained by Willka as due to 
economic, cultural, and political factors, starting with the 
struggle of the indigenous nations. 
  In his view, "the struggle is not always in the street. The 
struggle can be carried out in different ways, and the struggle 
of the indigenous nations has been one of resistance. They have 
resisted by retaining their cultural roots, their language, 
their laws, their form of organization, and even their 
territories." 
  This is why, he explains, the peasants produce 70 percent of 
the country's foodstuffs, while there is not even a single farm 
operator who produces quinua, lamb, kidney beans, broad beans, 
onions, cacao, lettuce, peaches, or corn. The only products the 
farm operators produce are sugarcane, soy beans, cotton, and 
beef. The peasants grow the coca. There are no farm operators 
who grow coca." 
  Cultural roots are another factor. Willka refers to the 
peasants' own organizations, structured "on the basis of the 
philosophy of the land." In this field, the fact that the land, 
under the Agrarian Reform Law, cannot be seized or divided, 
"means that no one can take our land from us, and it does not 
frighten us when they threaten us, saying `since you have been 
obstructing us, now you are going to lose your land.'" 
  The final factor Willka mentions is that the peasants have 
become aware that they have been exploited, excluded, and 
oppressed for the past 500 years, and they have never been able 
to have their own government. 
  With respect to the first, the peasant leader says that the 
peasants are participants in two forms of struggle: the class 
struggle, because they are exploited, "but we are also oppressed 
and excluded as nation and culture. This, then, is a factor that 
allows us to raise our consciousness." 
  Finally, he says that "governments have always been Creole 
or 
mestizo, never an Aymara nor any other indigenous nationality. 
This an awareness that is taking root in the communities and 
that is beginning to raise the question: when are we going to 
manage our own affairs?"

  [Text] Quito, 27 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Official sources reported 
today that the Ecuadoran Government will enforce the National 
Mobilization Decree that has been in effect since last week to 
counteract a 28 June labor strike declared to express support 
for Indian protests. 
  Government Minister Marcelo Santos said the government 
drafted a national plan to confront the work stoppage called by 
the United Workers Front (FUT). The strike was called to demand 
the suspension of the decree that established the state of 
emergency and to express support for the Indians who are 
demanding the repeal of the new Agrarian Development Law. 
  The strike is taking place one week after President Sixto 
Duran Ballen issued the mobilization decree following violent 
demonstrations staged by Indians to protest the Agrarian Law. 
  Santos announced the Army and police will be deployed within 
the framework of the National Mobilization Decree to maintain 
public order and to guarantee the Ecuadoran people's security 
during the strike, the fifth such strike declared by FUT in 22 
months since Duran Ballen took office. 
  Meanwhile, FUT President Juan Andrango confirmed the unions 
will stage a 24-hour strike on 28 June to express solidarity 
with the Indians and to condemn the government's economic 
policies. At a news conference, the union leader confirmed the 
labor union's decision to suspend work, and he outlined the 
"battle plan" workers will follow on 28 June. 
  The repeal of the National Mobilization Decree and the 
suspension of the Agrarian Development Law, which has triggered 
an Indian uprising, are among FUT's demands. FUT also is 
demanding that the government put a stop to constant rises in 
fuel prices and reject its "neoliberal" policies, including the 
privatization of public enterprises. 
  Alfredo Corral, labor and human resources minister, deemed 
the FUT strike "untimely," because talks between the government 
and the Indians on a new agrarian law are expected to resume 
soon. Corral maintained that FUT is very irresponsible because 
it is organizing a strike at a time when the executive branch's 
National Mobilization Decree remains in effect. The official 
added that the strike is not aimed at mitigating labor claims. 
Instead, he said its political undertones are evident within the 
pretext of expressing solidarity with peasants and Indians. 
  Minister Corral expressed regret over the union's decision 
and warned that, under the National Mobilization Decree, the 
Armed Forces will be in charge of ensuring the country's social 
order and peace. President Duran-Ballen last week issued the 
National Mobilization Decree to overcome internal unrest 
triggered by nine days of Indian protests over the Agrarian Law, 
which they say is unconstitutional. 
  The Indian demonstrations, including roadblocks, brought 
business to a standstill in at least six provinces of the 
inter-Andean and Amazon regions and sparked shortages of food, 
medicine, and petroleum byproducts in several regions. 
  Leaders of the Confederation of Indian Nationalities of 
Ecuador (Conaie), the group leading the demonstrations, have 
reported that at least four people have died, 15 have been 
wounded, and an undetermined number arrested during 
confrontations with security forces.

  [Excerpt] Quito, 27 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Union sources reported 
that Ecuadoran unions decided tonight to suspend the 24-hour 
general strike scheduled to begin early on Tuesday. The United 
Workers Front (FUT), which called the strike in solidarity with 
Indian organizations, said "conditions are not right" for the 
strike. 
  FUT President Raul Andrago said the workers' unions held an 
extraordinary meeting this afternoon and evening and agreed to 
suspend the strike that was scheduled to begin at 0600 on 
Tuesday (1100 GMT). The leader of the main union in this 
country of 11 million people clarified that the general strike 
has not been indefinitely suspended and announced that it will 
be held in mid-July, according to the circumstances. 
  FUT had called a 24-hour "preventive" strike for Tuesday to 
reject the economic policies of Conservative president Sixto 
Duran Ballen. The strike was also a show of support for the 
peasant and Indian movement headed by the Confederation of 
Indian Nationalities of Ecuador (Conaie). That organization is 
demanding that the government repeal the new agrarian law, which 
Conaie considers unconstitutional. [passage omitted]

  [Text] President Eduardo Frei departed for a three-day 
visit to the United States at 2045 on 26 June. During his brief 
trip to the United States, Frei is scheduled to hold meetings 
with top-ranking U.S. political and economic officials, the most 
important of which will be his meeting with U.S. President Bill 
Clinton. It is expected that the two presidents will surely 
discuss the Chilean-U.S. free trade agreement during this 
meeting. 
  Before his departure, the president headed the traditional 
transfer-of-power ceremony. During this ceremony, President 
Eduardo Frei transferred the presidency to Interior Minister 
German Correa in compliance with a decree read previously by 
Interior Under Secretary Belisario Velasco. German Correa 
assumed the presidency in his capacity as Chilean vice president. 
  Before boarding the plane that would take him to the United 
States, President Frei stated that his meeting with Bill Clinton 
does not seek solely commercial objectives: 
  [Begin Frei recording] This visit has much broader 
objectives. The free trade treaty is, of course, among the 
issues that will be discussed. This is not, however, the only 
issue to be discussed. There are many other issues. We are most 
interested in strengthening our political ties, on having fluent 
bilateral ties with the United States in vast areas. [end

  [Text] Concepcion -- Under Secretary of Foreign Relations 
Jose Miguel Insulza said Chile has a greater preference for 
joining NAFTA due to several favorable reasons but the 
government has not made an official decision yet on this issue. 
  He said: "I would say there is some preference, based on 
public opinion and comments made by President Eduardo Frei, for 
studying Chile's incorporation into NAFTA in greater detail but 
we are not excluding a free trade agreement with the United 
States." 
  He explained, however, that the government has not made any 
decision and hopes to make it in the next few days. He added: 
"For the time being our main decision is to be flexible, but we 
are willing to study other alternatives to choose what is best 
for the country." 
  Insulza admitted there is a majority opinion favorable to 
NAFTA because it is a known agreement, its benefits can be 
immediate for Chile, and it is made up of three countries (the 
United States, Mexico, and Canada) and not just one. He said: 
"The way labor and environmental issues are dealt with in NAFTA 
seem satisfactory to us. In other words, there are favorable 
good reasons. But we cannot fail to recognize that a free trade 
agreement with the United States has some advantages because it 
is more direct, immediate, and adjusted to our own situation." 
  He pointed out that the main disadvantage of a bilateral 
trade agreement is that a new agreement must be negotiated 
subject to conditions and reasons that are not well-defined. He 
added: "The government has not made a decision but from the 
opinions given by the majority of government officials one can 
deduce that there is a preference for NAFTA." 
  Insulza gave a lecture to Eighth Region exporters that was 
organized by the Regional Institute of Business Administration, 
IRADE, and Prochile entitled: "Strategy for Internationalizing 
Chile and Diplomacy for Development." 
  He said Chile will try to form a trade association or free 
trade with Mercosur [Common Market of the South], "to put it in 
simple terms," because it will open the markets of four 
countries (Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay) for us to 
increase our exports. He added: "Argentina and Brazil currently 
are our third- and fourth-largest trade partners, respectively, 
and there is no reason why they could not be the first and 
second due to the size of their markets and their closeness to 
us." 
  Insulza noted that for Chile, a country with an open economy 
and clear foreign trade rules, the ideal would be to have a 
multilateral system with clear rules. He indicated that although 
that system has not been achieved despite the progress made in 
the Uruguay Round, preferential agreements with different 
countries, regions, or groups of countries should be created. 
  He said Latin America and especially South America have 
received large quantities of Chilean exports in the last few 
years. He said Chile has balanced trade with Argentina of about 
$1 billion with a surplus of $7 million favorable to Chile. He 
added: "There is a relative balance with Uruguay, a slight 
deficit with Paraguay, and a big deficit of about $600 million 
with Brazil." 
  Insulza said this situation changes if one studies the 
balance of services, which generally is not included in the 
statistics; "if it were, Chile would have a surplus with those 
countries."

<F P=106> [Article by Claudia Saavedra] </F>
  [Excerpt] Ernesto Correa, president of the National Society 
of Agriculture (SNA), considers that there will be no 
appreciable benefits for the Chilean agricultural sector from a 
potential trade agreement with the United States. On the 
contrary, potentially negative effects will be felt in some 
areas, such as wheat, corn, sugar beets, oil seeds, and dairy 
products. 
  Concern has been caused by the rapid progress made in 
drafting a possible trade agreement with the United States. 
Correa considers that a complete and basic study has not yet 
been made of the implications of such an agreement for the 
national economy. At the same time he considered it unacceptable 
to sign an agreement providing for trade integration with the 
United States which could affect the implementation of Chilean 
agricultural policies. 
  The SNA leader recalled that the only effort made to study 
the possible effects of such an agreement was undertaken by the 
Confederation of Production and Trade (CPC). He considered this 
study only an "approach" to the subject. 
  Among the possible problems of a TLC [Free Trade Agreement] 
Correa gave one example. He mentioned that in the case of Mexico 
(which presently is a signatory of NAFTA [North American Free 
Trade Agreement]), the importation of North American sorghum is 
permitted, without the payment of customs duties, for subsequent 
reexport to the United States. 
  Some statements which have been made have caused greater 
concern in the SNA. It is still not clear whether Chile will 
adhere to NAFTA or will sign a bilateral agreement. 
<H5>  Subsidies </H5>
  In addition to the previously mentioned concern, Chilean 
farmers feel uncertainty about the possibility that an 
initiative like NAFTA could have an impact on agricultural 
policies now in effect in Chile. Correa said that these policies 
provide "minimum protection against sudden and artificial 
fluctuations in international prices caused to a large extent by 
the subsidies which the developed countries provide for their 
agricultural production and exports." He estimated that the 
United States Government pays $35 billion annually in subsidies 
to protect its farmers. 
  He repeated the concern of the SNA regarding the 
advisability 
of a policy of bilateral agreements as an alternative to the 
strategy of unilateral openness to the rest of the world, which 
has been the policy adopted in the past. He expressed the view 
that the number of bilateral agreements which have been entered 
into have ended up by "undermining the uniform structure of our 
customs tariffs." He said that "several of the preference 
agreements have seriously compromised domestic production." 
<H5>  Dollars </H5>
  What is happening to foreign exchange rates is a matter of 
concern to the SNA. During the first quarter of 1994 the U. S. 
dollar has declined by 3.3 percent. Over the past 12 months, 
according to SNA statistics, the decline has amounted to 6.2 
percent in real terms. 
  Correa said that this does not agree with what Eduardo 
Aninat, the minister of finance, said when he spoke at a meeting 
with businessmen on the first day in office of the new 
government. At the meeting Aninat emphasized the importance 
which stability in the rate of exchange of the U. S. dollar had 
for the Chilean export sector. Correa refuted this remark with 
the fact that the dollar has fallen in value, which, he 
considered, "could lead to a situation of extreme difficulty." 
  He said that the lesser value of the dollar, "has 
contributed 
to reducing inflationary pressures. However, among other 
aspects, it is harmful for the Chilean export sector," he 
emphasized. 
  Correa defended the Chilean agricultural sector, stating 
that 
it is not always the cause of an increase in the index of 
consumer prices. He said that there are some months, like April 
1994, when the index of consumer prices has recorded a decline.

<F P=106> [Report by special correspondent Mario Jose Errazuriz] </F>
  [Excerpt] Cartagena de Indias, Colombia -- President 
Eduardo Frei urged the meeting here of Ibero-American leaders to 
make urgent efforts to train and enhance human resources in 
their respective countries. Frei said it is important to 
implement educational systems that meet the needs of democracy. 
  He said Chile is promoting an educational reform program and 
urged Ibero-American countries to jointly progress in this area. 
  He urged them to make a serious and collective effort to 
promote scientific and technological development through the 
establishment of a scientific and technological development fund. 
  The Chilean president also proposed the promotion and 
advancement of free trade without restrictive mechanisms. 
  Frei told the 22 chiefs of state attending the meeting that 
within the framework of international trade and the opening of 
world markets, extra effort must be made to avoid protectionist 
measures or those that undermine competition among countries. 
  Frei formally invited those present to the Sixth 
Ibero-American Summit, scheduled for 1996, in Chile. 
  The Cartagena summit studied regional policies on trade, 
social development and integration. 
  Colombian President Cesar Gaviria officially opened the 
meeting yesterday. He said the Americas are creating a new 
international order based on interdependence. 
  The participants expressed support for the Chilean doctrine 
of "open regionalism," as reasserted by President Frei in his 
speech. After discussing it, the participants included this 
doctrine in the final document of the summit which ends today. 
  The opening ceremony was marked by the Colombian tragedy one 
week ago when an earthquake and a landslide killed, according to 
official figures, over 1,000 people; and Fidel Castro's 
aggressive speech against the United States. President Frei 
addressed the summit at 1810 Chilean time. He was the 15th chief 
of state to address the summit and he did so several hours 
behind schedule. 
  At about 0800 (0900 Chilean time), President Frei and his 
wife, Marta Larraechia, entered the Convention Center hall of 
flags, where the summit was held. He was greeted by President 
Gaviria. 
  After the opening ceremony, in which the Brazilian and 
Colombian presidents delivered speeches, the first session got 
under way. Frei was seated next to Fidel Castro. 
  Eduardo Frei said that although Chile has many options of 
joining integration organizations at the international level, it 
clearly upholds a Latin American integrationist tradition. 
  He said that in the next few years, Chile will implement a 
regional policy of economic and physical integration and 
cooperation at the educational, cultural, scientific, and 
technological levels. 
  He reasserted the criteria of adopting "open regionalism" on 
the basis of realistic, specific trade without exclusions." 
  He said: "In the economy, as in politics, exclusions are 
both 
unfair and dangerous." 
  Frei urged the Americas to improve their competitive level 
in 
the international market as a means to achieve an open economy. 
  Regarding competitiveness at the international level and its 
improvement, Frei said governments should "abstain from using 
mechanisms--be they financial, tax, economic, or of any other 
nature--to undermine competitiveness." 
  He said such measures distort comparative advantages and 
undermine the sale of more competitive Ibero-American products. 
  Frei criticized the use of policy mechanisms, like health, 
fiscal or environmental measures, to implement protectionist 
measures. 
  The Chilean president stressed the need to achieve national 
economic development on the basis of equity. He said: "The 
social dimension of development cannot and should not be 
overlooked." 
  He said political and economic achievements only make sense 
if they are accompanied by a substantial improvement of the 
standard of living for their people. 
  Frei stated: "Social development is the basis for 
democracy." 
  He said the main objective of his administration is to 
eradicate extreme poverty, adding that a culture of solidarity 
is being promoted to this effect. 
  He said this issue will be discussed at the Social 
Development Summit to be held next year in Copenhagen. He urged 
the chiefs of state to redouble their efforts so that Latin 
America may be duly represented at this meeting. 
  Eduardo Frei included in the summit's agenda a previously 
unmentioned issue: It involves giving women a bigger role, not 
just because they represent more than half the population in the 
region but because they are most affected by economic conditions. 
  Frei proposed institutionalizing a meeting of the ministers 
of women's affairs, or of those responsible for women's 
policies, to be held prior to the UN Conference on Women in 
Beijing in 1995. 
  He proposed Chile as the site of this first meeting. He also 
officially proposed that the Fourth Ibero-American Summit be 
held in Chile, as the foreign ministers approved on 13 June.

  [Text] While addressing the third working meeting of the 
Ninth Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias (Colombia) on 
27 June, Chilean President Eduardo Frei stated: "The lessons 
learned in Chile from its traumatic recent past have taught us 
that democracy is an absolute, indivisible value that cannot be 
minimized." 
  The Chilean president added that there may be "different 
ways 
to organize a state from the institutional viewpoint, but there 
cannot be different types of democracies for different types of 
societies. Democracy, in essence, cannot be upgraded or 
downgraded." 
  Frei continued: "We believe democracy exists when free, 
secret, and informed elections are held. We believe democracy 
exists when institutions and state branches are respected. We 
believe democracy exists when there is a Congress that 
functions, when there is an opposition force to supervise 
government actions. We believe democracy exists when there is an 
independent judicial branch to uphold the due process of law," 
and when "there is freedom of expression with communications 
media, freedom of information, and freedom of assembly." 
  Frei added that world "politicians and political leaders are 
harshly criticized; many say they are not politicians. Those of 
us seated here--heads of state are political leaders--are very 
proud to be politicians." 
  He added that if we want to rescue politics we have to 
address "two basic concepts. First, a basic ethical and moral 
concept and, second, a political leader must have a close 
relationship with the people. We must be concerned about every 
citizen, no matter how modest and humble." 
  The Chilean president said: "We must seek broad agreements 
within our countries. When a president seeks agreements and 
consensus within his country, the people say that he is weak, 
that he lacks power, and authority. I believe it is quite the 
opposite; those of us who seek great agreements and consensus 
bring stability to the countries, bring grandeur to labor." We 
respect power and authority "but at the same time we believe 
power to be impersonal, we believe the law is superior, and we 
believe in respect for the people." 
  President Frei met yesterday with his Bolivian counterpart 
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada. It was later disclosed that in 
September the foreign ministries of the two countries will 
disclose a proposal to step up bilateral relations. Frei denied 
that these talks will imply yielding territory to Bolivia, 
adding that "the subject is not on the agenda." Frei admitted, 
however, that the subject was raised by the Bolivian chief of 
state. 
  Frei commented on his meeting with Sanchez de Lozada, 
stating 
that it is important to meet with the various chiefs of state to 
assess relationships and determine how to improve them. 
  Frei will meet today with Cuban President Fidel Castro. 
  Although he did not disclose the subjects they will address, 
Frei said he upholds the proposal made at the summit: "We want 
democracy and want to consolidate it," just as we want "respect 
for human rights." He added: "Practically every country has 
asked Cuba for a gesture. We want Cuba in the Latin American 
system, but the next move is basically up to them."

  [Text] Most Chileans support President Eduardo Frei's 
administration even though this support is less than President 
Aylwin received during his first 90 days of government. 
  According to an Adimark poll conducted in Greater Santiago, 
54 percent support President Frei's administration, 15 percent 
disapprove, while 31 percent neither approves nor disapproves. 
Comparing these figures with the first 90 days of former 
President Aylwin's government, the support level is lower. 
  Concerning pending matters, 41 percent believe the 
government 
badly handled the case of [Carabineros Director General] Rodolfo 
Stange, 36 percent believe it handled it well, and 22 percent 
said they do not know. 
  Most Chileans believe Gen. Stange should resign.

teachers and the other coal miners: 
  [Begin Correa recording] These are long-lasting problems. 
They are not being politicized although some may be tempted to 
do so. For the time being, however, we have not detected any

  [Excerpt] The national council of CUT [United Labor 
Confederation] last night decided to begin a series of rallies 
on 11 July in response to what it considers the government's 
lack of attention to its petitions. 
  The resolution was approved unanimously by the 60 council 
members who met at CUT headquarters. 
  On 11 July, called the "Day of National Dignity" in memory 
of 
the date the copper mines were nationalized in 1971, CUT will 
stage two rallies along the Alameda, one beginning at the Plaza 
Italia and another in the Central Station. 
  Among other measures, which will be revealed today, the CUT 
national council decided to call a meeting of Confasin (National 
Labor Confederations, Federations, and Unions) for 21 June, 
during which they will agree on future actions. 
  Last night CUT appointed a committee that will organize the 
rallies and the other activities scheduled by CUT with the 
purpose of mobilizing a maximum number of workers. 
  In the past few days CUT has hardened its criticism of the 
current administration. 
  On 8 June, CUT President Manuel Bustos said that relations 
between the government and workers are at a turning point 
because of some pending labor reforms. 
  Bustos said that the workers are demanding changes to the 
collective bargains law, the dismissals law, and the National 
Training and Employment Service (Sence). He also said that CUT 
is willing to discuss the pending problems with the government, 
but he expects the government to make some decisions. 
  CUT Vice President Arturo Martinez said on 13 June that the 
rally does not mean a strike, but a call to attention by the 
workers. 
  A series of labor conflicts have taken place at different 
companies in the past 15 days during collective labor bargains.

<F P=106> [Article by Matilde Oliva] </F>
  [Text] President Frei has said that the government wishes 
to include all sectors of national life in the struggle against 
poverty. He made a statement to this effect when he presided 
over the ceremony at which the National Council Against Poverty 
was established. 
  The organization, which held its first meeting on 24 May, is 
made up of representatives of different national groups with 
experience in the field of social development. The government's 
intention was to bring together persons coming from the most 
representative areas of national life, both from the government 
as well as from the opposition, including social organizations, 
employers and workers, churches, and nongovernmental bodies. The 
names of the members of the council speak for themselves: 
Alberto Echegaray, president; Benito Baranda, executive 
secretary; Gonzalo de la Maza; Claudio Di Girolamo; Roberto 
Fantuzzi; Bishop Erasmo Farfan; Jose Antonio Guzman; Juan Pablo 
Illanes; Fernando Leniz; Haidee Lopez; Patricia Matte; Manfred 
Max-Neef; Ana Maria Medioli; Eugenio Ortega; Maria Rozas; 
Alberto Undurraga; Sara Vasquez; Humberto Vega; Monsignor Manuel 
Camilo Vial; and Jose Zavala. 
  According to the decree which approved its establishment, 
the 
objective of this council is to coordinate the participation of 
different social groups in answering the national challenge to 
overcome poverty; to propose action, programs, and strategies to 
make the social policy of the state more coherent in this sense; 
to advise the president and the interministerial, social 
committee; to propose ways of reducing poverty at the regional 
level; and to contribute to the program that Chile will present 
to the Social Development Summit Meeting of the United Nations. 
  President Frei was the only speaker at the ceremony. In his 
speech he said: "From this place we must be able to call on the 
conscience of all Chileans so that the task of wiping out 
extreme poverty will not just be a government policy but the 
fundamental concern of the nation." He recalled that the basic 
priority of his administration is to concentrate its efforts on 
the nine percent of the population, or about 1.2 million 
Chileans, "who live under subhuman conditions in the most 
extreme poverty and destitution." 
  At the same time he added that he will fight to raise 
minimum 
wages and to improve living conditions among some three million 
people who live under precarious conditions. 
  As to where the emphasis will be placed in the national 
program to overcome poverty, President Frei pointed out that 
efforts will be concentrated on specific programs aimed at 
infants, senior citizens who lack resources, young people, 
women, urban and rural small businessmen, farmers, the 
indigenous peoples, and the handicapped. 
  He stated: "In short the program for overcoming poverty will 
emphasize the development of backward sectors and will ensure 
better opportunities for the most vulnerable groups of society." 
  He emphasized that he hopes to see that an additional public 
effort is made through the "contributions and the generous 
initiatives of employers, workers, academic personalities, 
church leaders, and representatives of nongovernmental 
organizations, who can design a program as ambitious or even 
more so than what the government will do." 
  For his part Luis Maira, minister of planning and 
cooperation, announced that within the next two weeks the 
interministerial social committee will unveil the national 
program for abolishing poverty in the budget of 1994 and the 
criteria for the preparation of the budget for 1995. He said: 
"These criteria are going to redirect public expenditures and 
social priorities toward the poorest groups among the people, 
such as the regions and territories which now have the greatest 
cumulative problems." 
  The minister also said that during the second half of June a 
meeting will be held of all senior administrative officials, 
called by minister of the interior German Correa, to discuss the 
implementation of the plan at the national level.

<F P=106> [Article by Fernando Rospigliosi in the "Controversies" </F>
column: "Obscurity-Transparency"] 
  [Text] The changes that the pro-government majority is 
introducing into the electoral system, under the pretext of 
making it more efficient, only cast new shadows on the 
transparency of that system. 
  The installation of a computation section in each voting 
place, where all the tallies of the sections are gathered and an 
additional tally is prepared with the total number of votes at 
that location, complicates the counting, makes it more 
troublesome, and slows the process unnecessarily. 
  The simplest and fastest way is precisely what is not done: 
send in each section's results as these partial results are 
obtained. In this way, unnecessary problems are avoided, such as 
those caused by a situation where, in a voting station where 
there are 30-40 sections, the transmission of results can be 
delayed for many hours because of the need to compile a new 
tally, and because one or two of those sections will probably 
lag behind the others. 
  In the recent election in Panama, where I was an observer, 
the sections--each one had up to 350 voters--closed at 1600. At 
2000, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal announced the partial 
results and continued to broadcast the results as the counting 
proceeded. At 0800 on the following day, the president of the 
Tribunal appeared on television and announced the vote count, 
which was almost 90 percent complete. In other words, an almost 
definitive result. A little later, the president of the republic 
received in the palace the winning candidate, who had won by a 
narrow margin of 4 percent of the vote. 
  In Peru, for simple balloting such as the plebiscite of 31 
October 1993 in which there were only yes and no votes, the 
National Electoral Board took two months to announce the 
results. There was never any reasonable explanation for that 
monumental delay, which contributed to the 
plebiscite--justifiably--being called into question. 
  In Panama, the Electoral Tribunal used a system called TER, 
Unofficial Transmission of Results. (In reality, it is 
provisional or partial, but not unofficial, because it is 
carried out by an official organization.) 
  The TER was based on a very simple form that the secretary 
of 
each section filled out as soon as the tallying was completed, 
and which was then turned over to an employee of the Tribunal, 
who was responsible for a certain number of sections. This 
employee then turned over the form to a supervisor, who sent it 
to a collection center where it was fed into a computer. The 
system worked uninterruptedly. If one or two sections were 
delayed in closing, they did not slow the process. There were 25 
tallying centers in the country that were connected to a central 
computer, on the screens of which the results automatically 
appeared as soon as they were entered. All the news media--and 
therefore the public--had immediate access to the results. 
  These results were provisional, because they were announced 
before any decisions were made over possible challenges. But 
unless there are many such challenges, the final result would 
not change significantly. 
  In its turn, the Commission for Justice and Peace, 
affiliated 
with the Catholic Church, established a system of "parallel 
tallying" of votes, which is a form of surveillance of the state 
by society. This system was what permitted the Church to 
denounce the fraud perpetrated in 1989, when General Manuel 
Noriega tried to manipulate the electoral process and deny the 
victory of the civilian opposition, which had won with 70 
percent of the vote. 
  Although the situation had changed in 1994 and the 
Commission 
for Justice and Peace had complete confidence in the Electoral 
Tribunal, it conducted--for the last time--the parallel tally. 
  To do this, they organized some 1600 volunteers, one for 
approximately four electoral sections. These volunteers took 
note of each section's results and turned them over to one of 
the 150 supervisors who visited the voting places. The results 
were transmitted by telephone, fax, or radio to one of the 
Commission's three tallying centers in the country--the center 
in Panama City had 40 computers and as many telephone 
lines--which in turn sent the results by telephone line (modem) 
to a central computer. 
  Thus, in the space of a few hours, this parallel system 
tallied approximately 80 percent of the votes cast, obtaining a 
result with a margin of error of less than one percent. 
  These systems, the official one as well as the parallel 
tally, are used with minor variations in almost all the 
countries of Latin America. Only in Peru are obsolete systems 
maintained and attempts made to prevent a parallel tally. The 
reasons are not technical, as no great sophistication nor 
mysterious technology is required. 
  With a few computers, telephone lines--and radios--and 
reasonable organization, reliable results are obtainable in a 
few hours. 
  The problems are political, and they relate to attempts by a 
civilian--military clique to perpetuate itself in power, and 
which will not hesitate to thwart the people's mandate, if it 
can. 
  This is why the next weeks and months in determining the 
electoral system and mechanisms will be decisive.

  [Text] This morning, the Senate approved articles of a bill 
to punish active-duty military and police personnel who become 
involved in partisan politics. Punishment ranges between six 
months and two years of imprisonment. Two opinions, one raised 
by the Legislative Committee and another by the Constitutional 
Affairs Committee, were considered. 
  The first paragraph of Article No. 1 states that violations 
include "opinions, remarks, or expressions on partisan politics 
or proselytizing acts." There was a long discussion on the 
possibility of applying this provision to public or private 
activities. As we went to press, some congressmen were asking 
for a reconsideration of this paragraph. 
  The senators also described as a violation "any presence at 
meetings organized by political, partisan, movement, municipal, 
departmental, or national authorities that are not of an 
official, professional, or merely social nature." 
  Another violation of the bill approved by the plenary 
session 
involves "the presence of military or police personnel at 
meetings of political parties, movements, or factions, even if 
said meetings are held at buildings that do not belong to any 
party or movement." In addition, "efforts to raise funds and 
resources for any type of political activity, their donation, or 
their management by military or police personnel or any 
intermediary" will be considered a violation. In its last 
paragraph, the bill describes "political party or movement 
membership" by military or police personnel as a serious 
violation. 
  Article No. 2 establishes that ordinary criminal courts will 
hear the appropriate proceedings, which may be filed through an 
official petition or through a petition by any qualified person. 
Article No. 3 establishes that an arrest warrant against 
military or police personnel involved in these violations will 
automatically entail the suspension of their duties and that 
they will serve their arrest at a unit established by the office 
of the Armed Forces commander-in-chief or the national police. 
The last article of the approved bill states that those who 
violate the current bill will be liable to a prison term ranging 
between six months and two years.

  [Text] The transport of cocaine from Bolivia and Colombia 
-- though from the latter country to a lesser extent -- to 
Europe has reportedly become easier with the discovery of a 
direct route to the European black markets. 
  The construction of clandestine airstrips for medium- and 
large-sized planes in the Paraguayan Chaco is reportedly the key 
to all this. Bolivian drug traffickers are reportedly gradually 
giving up the obligatory route through Asuncion for shipment of 
cocaine directly from the Chaco. 
  Police sources have reported that the Chaco-Europe 
connection 
reportedly includes Spain and Portugal, and other neighboring 
countries, as the final destination for the drugs. 
  Top officials from the National Antinarcotics Secretaria 
(Senad) are reportedly aware of this fact, which is under 
investigation to verify the seriousness of what is really 
happening. 
  The sources added that the clandestine airstrips are no 
longer limited to small single-engine or twin-engine planes, but 
can also receive larger planes capable of direct international 
flights or with fewer stopovers. 
  The controls carried out lately at the airports in the 
various countries of our continent have forced traffickers to 
find other ways to continue to export cocaine to Europe with the 
least risk possible. 
  The Paraguayan Chaco offers the traffickers the best 
possibilities for conducting clandestine operations and flights, 
due to little or no air or land control, the sources added. 
  Senad does not yet know for sure where the landing strips 
are 
located, although the sources reported that they could be 
located in Pedro P. Pena, Eugenio A. Garay, Parque Cue, and 
Infante Rivarola. The police sources added that these airstrips 
could also be located north of Lagerenza, or in the woods near 
San Alfredo or Sierra Leon.

  [Text] Washington, 23 Jun (EFE) -- Argentine President 
Menem surprised the media in Washington today when he said the 
World Trade Organization (WTO) is "a European Community (EC)" 
organization, "not an international community" organization. 
  The blunder occurred during a news conference at the 
Argentine Embassy in Washington after a meeting between Menem 
and U.S. President Bill Clinton when Menem was asked to clarify 
the situation of two Latin American candidacies to head the WTO, 
which comprises 111 countries. 
  Menem explained that during the recent Fourth Ibero-American 
summit in Cartagena de Indias (Colombia) his country supported a 
Colombian proposal nominating Mexican President Carlos Salinas 
de Gortari to head the WTO at the end of his presidential term. 
  Menem added that at the time he was unaware the Brazilian 
Government had proposed Economy Minister Rubens Ricupero, a 
veteran diplomat and former Brazilian negotiator at GATT. 
  The surprise occurred when Menem said it was up to the EU 
(Menem insists on calling it "community") to name a president 
for the WTO, an organization created to implement GATT 
agreements that is expected to become operational next year. 
  "Of course, it is up to EC members to decide on these 
candidacies and (the president) might very well be European," 
Menem said. 
  Journalists asked why the EC would have the power to choose 
the president of the WTO and Menem said: "Because it is an EC 
organization." 
  "It is not a world organization, it is an EC organization," 
Menem insisted despite the organization's name which clearly 
identifies it as being global. 
  "If you have any doubt, I will tell you again," the 
Argentine 
president repeated to the astonished Brazilian journalist who 
asked him to confirm his remarks. 
  Menem added: "I will clarify things even more: During the 
Ibero-American meeting we asked Spain and Portugal to sponsor 
Salinas' candidacy. It is an EC organization, not a world 
community organization," Menem insisted. 
  Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella, who was sitting 
next to Menem, just put his head in his hands. Argentine 
Ambassador Raul Granillo Ocampo, who was sitting next to Menem, 
made no attempt to correct him either.

<F P=106> [Report by unidentified NA "special correspondent"] </F>
  [Text] Washington, 23 Jun (NA) -- President Carlos Menem 
announced on 23 June that U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor will travel to Argentina in the upoming days in order to 
find a definite solution to the controversial issue of medicine 
patents. 
  According to Menem, the issue of a law on patents demanded 
by 
the United States was not broached during his talk with his U.S. 
counterpart, Bill Clinton. However, U.S. Ambassador to 
Argentina James Cheek hinted to the contrary. 
  "Ask your president," responded Cheek, when the NOTICIAS 
ARGENTINAS NEWS AGENCY special correspondent asked him about the 
subject. He nonetheless hastened to add: "I would not say that 
this subject was not discussed." 
  Menem told journalists that negotiations "are developing 
along normal lines and dialogue is under way." 
  When asked whether pressure was being applied to have the 
issue settled by 30 June, Menem underscored: "There are neither 
threats nor anything remotely similar." 
  The deadline the U.S. Government established for Argentina 
to 
enact the new law on medicine patents so as not to be on the 
list of countries liable for commercial sanctions expires on 30 
June. 
  U.S. pharmaceutical companies have for a long time been 
requesting that their Argentine counterparts acknowledge 
intellectual property rights in the manufacturing of medicines. 
  The Argentine executive branch has sent a patents bill to 
Congress, but it has not been discussed yet because several 
sectors involved have seriously questioned some of its points. 
  The first deadline for the passing of the patents law had 
been established for 30 April. On that day, Kantor was to 
appear before the U.S. Congress to charge Argentina with not 
doing things by the book in commercial matters and to recommend 
sanctions against it. 
  Nevertheless, Kantor finally relented and decided to let 
things ride until the end of June. 
  Concurrent with this latent threat, several U.S. officials 
have visited Argentina recently -- including Vice President 
Albert Gore -- and they all invariably spoke of the need for the 
enactment of the patents law. 
  When U.S. Trade Secretary Ronald Brown arrives in Argentina 
on 28 June, he will prove to be no exception. He already has 
announced that the protection of patents and rights to 
intellectual property is "one of the most important 
considerations that likely investors take into account to 
determine a country's investment climate." 
  Kantor himself discussed this issue with Menem personally 
when both met in Chile for President Eduardo Frei's inauguration. 
  Now, when everything led to a surmise that the issue of 
patents would be on the agenda of the meeting between Clinton 
and Menem, the latter took pains to deny it. 
  "We did not talk about that subject with President Clinton. 
I would like to tell you that there is good news for the 
Argentine Republic concerning that subject and rightly before 
the established date, but no questions, please," he stressed. 
  To conclude, the head of state looked at the journalists and 
asked them to bring up the subject "after 30 June."

  [Text] Boston, 25 Jun (NA) -- Raul Granillo Ocampo, 
Argentine ambassador to the United States, announced today that 
"the pharmaceutical patents issue will be resolved before the 
end of the month in Washington," probably after a number of 
meetings between high-ranking U.S. and Argentine trade officials. 
  Granillo Ocampo made this remark during an exclusive 
interview with the NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS news agency a few minutes 
after the conclusion of a World Cup soccer game between the 
Argentine and Nigerian teams. 
  The ambassador went to the stadium, representing President 
Carlos Menem. The diplomat said that the president "followed 
the game on television" at a hotel in the southern city of New 
Orleans. 
  The ambassador emphasized that "there will be good news" on 
the pharmaceutical patents issue, which worries the U.S. 
Government because the U.S. laboratories are asking the 
Argentine laboratories to pay for intellectual property rights. 
  Moving on, the diplomat emphasized the significance of a 
meeting held yesterday in the White House between Presidents 
Menem and Clinton. 
  The diplomat said: "I would say it was a really superb 
meeting due to the issues discussed, the quality of the meeting, 
the agreement that existed, and the good news that they gave us 
but asked us to keep secret for the time being. [no closing 
quotation marks as received] 
  The ambassador refused to provide any details on the matter, 
but admitted that "there is good news on the pharmaceutical 
patents issue." 
  The diplomat announced that a U.S. Government envoy would 
travel to Buenos Aires to confirm "that Argentina has awakened 
interest here." 
  The ambassador said: "The person is like a foreign trade 
minister, who will go to approve certain trade agreements that 
the two countries are in the process of concluding." 
  Granillo Ocampo believes that the second meeting between 
Presidents Bill Clinton and Carlos Menem this year "represents a 
recognition of our country, as it was arranged in 10 days and 
because top-level U.S. Government officials were present, which 
demonstrates that Argentina is being described a country worth 
talking to." 
  Granillo Ocampo stressed: "This also demonstrates that 
President Menem is being described as a valid person to talk to, 
and that when he is in the United States high-level talks are 
held, taking advantage of his presence."

  [Text] London, 24 Jun (AFP-NA) -- Having met with U.K. 
Government officials and politicians, a high-powered delegation 
of five Argentine deputies today concluded a five-day official 
visit to London at the invitation of the U.K. Government. 
  During a news conference, Jorge Matzkin, Justicialist 
(neo-Peronist) bloc leader in the Chamber of Deputies said: 
"This is the first time that an (Argentine) delegation has been 
officially invited" to London by the Foreign Office of the U.K. 
Government since the Malvinas War in 1982. 
  "The main objective of this visit was to improve relations 
with our counterparts, especially in the House of Commons. We 
talked about everything. We openly broached controversial 
issues like the Malvinas Islands and subjects of common 
interest," he pointed out. 
  The five deputies met with David Heathcoat-Amory, the 
secretary of state for Latin American affairs, on 20 June. 
During the meeting, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd suddenly 
appeared to greet the visitors. 
  According to Florencio Acenolaza, chairman of the Foreign 
Relations and Worship Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, Hurd 
recalled his government's stance, saying that it wants "to 
respect the will of the inhabitants" of the Malvinas Islands. 
  The Argentine deputies mentioned that Argentina believes the 
conflict is not between the islanders and Argentina but rather 
between Argentina and the U.K. 
  Acenolaza said the delegation "aired all its grievances over 
the Malvinas Islands without restraint." They even voiced 
concern about issues including "the preservation of the 
environment and oil." 
  "There were no differences or gray areas," he said, 
insisting 
that the current trend is "very positive." He added that it 
constitutes "a new landmark" within a framework of "human rather 
than political relationships." 
  When inviting Kelpers to visit Argentina to establish 
"human, 
not political relations," Matzkin told them: You will like 
Argentina! 
  The lawmakers reported that they did not discuss the thorny 
issue of war crimes committed -- according to Buenos Aires -- by 
British soldiers or the possible request for the extradition of 
former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on war crimes charges. 
  The other members of the Argentine delegation were Francisco 
Duranona, (UCeDe [Democratic Center Union] Lower House bloc 
leader); Javier Menenghini (Radical Civic Union Lower House bloc 
deputy leader); and Marco Micheli (Conservative Party Lower 
House bloc leader).

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 26 Jun (EFE) -- Argentine Vice Foreign 
Minister Fernando Petrella today guaranteed that Argentina would 
not accept any oil exploitation in the Malvinas Islands if this 
activity created unilateral problems harming its stance in the 
dispute over the sovereignty of the islands. 
  Petrella told the Argentine DYN news agency: "Oil is very 
important, but is not of paramount importance, as there is oil 
everywhere. This does not, however, mean that we are giving it 
away to the British." 
  In Petrella's opinion, the possible oil activities in the 
islands "create problems, as there might exist jurisdiction 
issues harming the Argentine stance, and this is unacceptable." 
  In this regard, the vice minister mentioned the High-Level 
Group of Argentine and British officials who will meet on 14 and 
15 July in the city of Buenos Aires to discuss issues of 
bilateral interest, including oil. 
  In Petrella's opinion, the formation of this group involved 
the establishment of an important link between the two 
countries, which have decided to work on the sovereignty issue 
and recognize the existence of a dispute.

<F P=106> ["Special report" by former Central Bank President Rodolfo </F>
Rossi] 
  [Text] Buenos Aires, 24 Jun -- The rise in the prices of 
nearly all raw materials on international markets (as well as 
those of commodities [preceding word in English] of basic 
manufactured goods) poses the question of whether we are 
witnessing a generalized bout of worldwide inflation. 
  The surge in prices is seen in commodities such as coffee, 
the price of which has gone up 66 percent so far this year; 
wool, up 45 percent; and cotton, a 35 percent increase. As for 
crude oil, the WTI [expansion unknown] currently is being quoted 
at more than $20 per barrel rising from $14 in March. 
  Grains have recorded heavy gains. Wheat jumped to the 
forefront in Chicago, rising 21 percent in the last 12 months. 
Corn increased 32 percent in the same period, and soybeans were 
up 18 percent. 
  Argentina's exports stand to benefit from this surge in the 
value of grains and oil seeds. This year export earnings will 
be $600 million higher than last year. It also will benefit 
from the increase in the value of oil, and its exports will 
total at least $1.25 billion. 
  Notwithstanding this, within an international context 
characterized by great volatility in quotations, the drop in the 
value of the U.S. dollar over the last few days leads one to 
forecast an increase in international interest rates (not only 
in the United States, but also in Europe) on account of the need 
for attracting capital and also as a move to defend their 
respective currencies (the U.S. trade deficit grew 22 percent in 
April compared with the previous month, amounting to $8.4 
billion). 
  The "climax" of the increase in interest rates, also 
prompted 
by the inflationary syndrome -- a rise in the value of raw 
materials and commodities [preceding word in English] -- 
probably will offset the benefit derived from better export 
prices. 
  The negative effect for our country would be the incidence 
of 
higher international prices on domestic prices, which would 
adapt to the increase in prices.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 23 Jun (NA) -- Cordoba Governor 
Eduardo Angeloz has warned that "some provinces are on the brink 
of collapse or bankruptcy." Angeloz added that the economic plan 
"has started breaking the pillars sustaining it." 
  "When you start setting strict guidelines limiting 
productive 
activities or people's activities things start to break down. 
People start complaining and you start seeing the possibility of 
unrest in many towns and provinces," the governor said. 
  Angeloz said he is not pointing his arrows directly at 
Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo. The governor believes Cavallo 
"cannot feel he owns the country. He cannot dictate rules for 
others simply to follow or be placed on lists under definitions 
only he makes." 
  The governor said the main causes of discontent that might 
result in "social upheavals" are produced mainly by "the growing 
trade balance deficit, the transfer to the nation of bankrupted 
education centers and health systems, and the national 
government's indifference to producer needs." 
  "People perceive that their personal situation is not 
improving, that the country is not growing, and notice that the 
social security system has very big holes," Angeloz insisted. 
  Angeloz protested because the provinces now must administer 
their education and health systems "without resources," a 
situation that is aggravated "because now the provinces get 44 
percent and the nation 56 percent of the 4 billion pesos of 
federal income sharing, a situation that is just the opposite of 
the situation we had before." 
  Angeloz expressed doubts that former President Alfonsin had 
said that the Radical Party [Radical Civic Union, UCR] will lose 
the 1995 election, but just in case he made clear that he does 
not share that belief, stressing: "Those who leave the 
battlefield, those who do not fight, are leaving an empty space 
that others will occupy." 
  "This will not happen to the UCR. We will fight in all areas 
to transform the party and create a government alternative," 
Angeloz promised. He made these remarks during the program "Two 
Voices" that is broadcast on cable television.

  [Text] Caracas, 27 Jun (DPA) -- The administration of 
President Rafael Caldera will implement controls on prices and 
on the dollar exchange to cope with the severe financial and 
monetary crisis in Venezuela, congressmen from three political 
parties announced after meeting with the chief of state. 
  Spokespersons for the ruling National Convergence, the 
Movement Toward Socialism (MAS), and the opposition workers 
Radical Cause Party expressed their support today at Miraflores 
Palace for the government's "emergency" measures and requested 
tighter controls on the banking system. One-third of the 
country's banks ended up in state hands due to the liquidity 
crisis at nine institutions. 
  The opposition Social Christian Party, Copei, and the social 
democratic Democratic Action Party did not express their 
position on the new official measures of Caldera, who began his 
second government term on 2 February. The 78-year-old president 
will address the country on a television network tonight to 
announce the new measures. 
  As a reflection of the severe situation, the dollar has 
jumped from 117 bolivares (national currency) in late April to 
200 last Thursday. The government has availed itself of a 
prolonged banking holiday that began on Friday to draft the new 
measures. 
  According to commentators, the Venezuelan state provided 
assistance "without sufficient guarantees" to new banks in 
crisis on the order of $4 billion. This "financial crack" began 
last January with the intervention at Banco Latino, until that 
time considered the country's second most important bank. The 
state intervened at eight other banks two weeks ago.

<F P=106> ["Message to the Nation" by President Rafael Caldera from </F>
Miraflores Palace on 27 June -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] The Council of Ministers, which met this morning and 
this afternoon, has come out definitively in favor of 
establishing an exchange control. For this purpose, I held long, 
arduous conversations with the Banco Central de Venezuela Board 
of Directors. For respectable reasons, Banco Central had 
expressed at many meetings the necessity of finding other paths 
and formulas, none of which, unfortunately, yielded the expected 
results. 
  I said in my inaugural speech on 2 February that there would 
be no exchange controls. I said it with absolute sincerity. That 
was my intention, and I have held it up until today. The truth 
is, however, that we have been forced to take this measure by 
the seriousness of the financial situation, the insistent wave 
of rumors, the speculative movements that have tried to topple 
the bolivar to the floor. We are well aware of the 
disadvantages, problems, and dangers, but they are unavoidable. 
We cannot allow international reserves to be depleted. We cannot 
allow the unjustified devaluation of our currency to continue. 
When I say it is unjustified, that is because Venezuela produces 
the necessary foreign exchange for its legal commercial exchange. 
  The pressures on the exchange market are due to speculative 
movements or to the distrust created by a series of rumors. Such 
rumors have confused Venezuelans about the measures we had to 
adopt to intervene at eight financial institutions, which we 
tried to save by every means possible. In the end, however, we 
concluded it was virtually impossible to save them. 
  To establish the exchange control, of course in keeping with 
the Banco Central Board of Directors, another series of 
indispensable measures had to be taken. One of them is the 
suspension of constitutional guarantees. We have had to resort 
to this extreme so my government will have the adequate means to 
fully achieve its objective. 
  We have made this decision with total responsibility. We 
will implement it prudently as we have acted throughout the five 
months of my government. At the same time, however, we will 
implement it with the force necessary to save the country from 
the crisis in which it is immersed. 
  We did not created this crisis. The crisis is the result of 
a 
long period of corruption and serious mistakes in the country's 
past. We have used all regular means to confront the crisis. We 
have reached a point now when we feel we must take the 
extraordinary measures afforded us by the Constitution and laws 
without delay. 
  The Development Ministry will be in charge of placing price 
controls on basic articles by applying a consumer protection 
law. It is crucial that we achieve this because the wave of 
speculation, under the pretense of the foreign exchange hike, 
has been so disproportionate that it is totally unjustifiable. I 
say it is a pretense because, although inflation can be blamed 
on the decline of our currency, the price increase has been 
several times greater than the highest inflation rate observed. 
  Thus the struggle against speculation is in the government's 
hands. We feel our people's deep pain, especially in the lower 
and middle classes, for the unbridled scarcity in the country. 
We are going to fight beside the people so we can, in some way, 
correct this tremendous mistake. 
  We will adopt several complementary measures at the cabinet 
meeting to be held the day after tomorrow. Among the measures to 
be taken is the issuance of food and transportation bonuses. 
These actions seek to improve the true income of the sectors 
that have been most negatively affected by the current crisis. 
  Furthermore, in addition to implementing foreign exchange 
and 
price controls, we will adopt measures to control the financial 
institutions. We are willing to stringently apply all necessary 
norms to see that banking institutions act correctly and that a 
crisis of this nature does not happen again. 
  The government has done and is willing to do all it can to 
protect the small account holders who have trusted in the 
seriousness and responsibility of financial institutions and who 
are overwrought because they don't know what will become of 
their small savings. The small account holders can rest assured 
that the commitments established by law and maintained by the 
government will be upheld and increased by the measure necessary 
to grant them the justice they are owed. 
  The measures we have adopted are not isolated acts. They are 
part of our social and economic policies. The social policy is 
based primarily on the price controls, food and transportation 
bonuses, which I mentioned previously, and the struggle to 
improve real wages. It is also based on a number of initiatives, 
programs, and plans that will be announced to the people very 
soon because they are already being implemented. We want to get 
the consumer as close as possible to the producer by offering 
better ways to obtain the necessary basic products in the 
marketplace. 
  We also want to protect and defend the activities that 
generate jobs, such as small and intermediate industries. These 
sectors are going through a very difficult situation. The same 
goes for the agricultural producers who have experienced a very 
serious crisis in the past years, perhaps even more serious than 
the one in the urban areas. 
  In this respect, I must say that the foreign exchange 
control 
puts us on a promising path. Now we can start thinking about 
implementing a plan to decrease interest rates, which have 
reached levels that are absolutely incompatible with the 
possibilities of the productive sectors, and to eliminate the 
zero coupon bonds. We have opposed this mechanism in the past 
because, although it attempts to alleviate the country's 
situation, it has triggered rather serious results. 
  On the other hand, all of this is within the context of an 
overall economic policy. Venezuela is a good country for 
investment. Investors come to the country every day, and we are 
willing to offer them every guarantee. For some -- because some 
people criticize everything -- the policy could seem to present 
an obstacle to investors. On the contrary, investors need a 
stable currency. Investors need assurances that the country's 
foreign reserves will not be depleted. Investors need a system 
they can trust, and it is precisely that trust which we want to 
give investors and everyone in the country. We are willing to 
promote investment and open paths for investment in the areas of 
oil, petrochemicals, mining, and all other areas that are open 
to projects through concession. It has taken us some time to 
prepare the first plans for bidding, but the time is near when 
we will offer those who are interested the opportunity to invest 
in the Romulo Betancourt Eastern Freeway. 
  I have a great deal of trust in my country and I am sincere 
when I speak to my people. I know that we are taking harsh 
measures and that there are dangers we must avoid. One danger 
posed by exchange controls is that they could be invaded by 
corruption. We will keep an eye on that. We are going to choose 
very honorable, patriotic persons who are determined to serve 
Venezuela to supervise this matter. 
  It is essential that we work together. Today I was pleased 
to 
meet with representatives of the media. It was a cordial meeting 
with reporters from various media. I met with those who write 
the news, those who report the news on television and radio, and 
those who inform us with their photographs, the photographers. I 
told them that Venezuela is proud of its media, and we hope the 
media will be proud of Venezuela. We do not want the media to 
report only what is wrong. We do not want the media to enhance 
the negative aspects. We want the media to cover positive facts, 
to contribute to the advancement of our country, and to 
encourage our people to be proud of being children of this 
glorious country. I addressed the representatives of the media 
with great affection, as I address my fellow countrymen now. 
  Dear Venezuelans, dear fellow countrymen, dear friends; let 
us work together to overcome this crisis. You know this crisis 
was not created by this government. If there is one thing you 
can say about this government -- and as I said during my 
inaugural speech -- we will do all we can to face the situation. 
The time has come to use our extraordinary resources, but within 
the framework of our Constitution and the democratic 
institution. In order to maintain this democratic institution, 
we must adopt measures that may be harsh and rigorous. These 
measures, however, are honestly and diligently aimed at 
guaranteeing the welfare of the country, Venezuela's welfare. 
For the good of Venezuela, I reiterate my trust and absolute 
assurance that we will have the understanding and support of the 
Venezuelan people, who are confronting these times so full of 
uncertainty and contradiction. We will overcome these problems 
to ensure a good future for our beloved country, Venezuela.

  [Text] Eduardo Fernandez, president of the Thought and 
Action Foundation, has presented 10 proposals "that may help us 
out of the crisis, stabilize the economy, and launch a period of 
growth and social prosperity." He revealed the proposals at the 
forum "How to Have Confidence in Venezuela," which was organized 
by the Metropolitan University Student Council. The forum, which 
is taking place at the Consolidated Cultural Center, will 
conclude today. 
  He stated that "at the Thought and Action Foundation, we 
have 
been studying the country's economic and social crisis. A few 
days ago, Harvard University invited me to a seminar to discuss 
the economic and social situation in Latin America. Countries 
that are achieving success, like Chile, Argentina, Peru, 
Bolivia, Colombia, and Mexico, were cited as examples there. 
Venezuela is not yet on that list of successful countries." 
  Fernandez asserted that "Venezuela can be just as successful 
as other countries, if not more so, if we do things right." 
  The 10 proposals put forward by Eduardo Fernandez are the 
following: 
  1. Restructure public finances. This includes, of course, a 
reform of the tax system to expand the base of taxpayers paying 
moderate rates. In other words, a value-added tax throughout the 
chain of commercial sales, that is, all the way to the final 
consumer. The countries that have achieved success have done it 
this way. 
  2. Pursue a serious privatization policy that will open up 
opportunities for new and better investment, both national and 
international. 
  3. Defend workers' wages and middle class income. Because 
this is so necessary, the battle against inflation and the high 
cost of living must be a top priority. Part and parcel of this 
effort is support for the Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) in its 
defense of the country's foreign reserves and its efforts to 
stabilize the bolivar. 
  Confidence is not the exclusive responsibility of the BCV. 
There must be harmony between monetary and exchange policy and 
fiscal policy. 
  4. Work to create jobs and wealth. To deal with 
unemployment, 
both actual and potential, we need a policy of openness to 
domestic and foreign public and private investment. 
  At this time, Venezuela is not on the list of countries 
where 
international advisers are recommending investment. Other 
countries are making investments that could come to our shores 
and help create jobs and generate wealth. I have talked to 
people associated with international financial centers, and they 
acknowledge that with a coherent economic policy, Venezuela 
could once again be an attractive place for investment. 
  New investment will come in when we have clear and stable 
rules of play. We must not forget that new investment 
represents new jobs, new job opportunities, and new economic 
resources for the country. 
  5. Continue to be an oil-producing country. The Investment 
Plan of Venezuelan Petroleum, Inc. (PDVSA) is ready. This 
program must be given broad national support. We must also 
support the strategic partnerships that have been designed to 
contribute to the development of our oil potential. 
  6. Move ahead decisively to create pension funds and 
modernize the reform of social benefits with a view to giving 
Venezuelan workers a comprehensive and modern system of social 
security. The Thought and Action Foundation organized a seminar 
on this issue a few weeks ago, and I have no doubt that the 
climate is right for reaching a broad consensus in this regard. 
  7. Complete the clean-up of the Venezuelan financial system. 
To achieve this goal, I propose a policy of openness and 
competition. Only in this way will Venezuela's development be 
assured of enough solid financing to make it competitive in the 
world economy. 
  By opening up the system and encouraging competition, we 
will 
help reduce interest rates, which is necessary to stimulate 
investment in projects that are of interest for economic growth. 
  8. Adopt a policy of openness to international trade and 
integration in increasingly larger economic spheres. In the long 
run, the objective should be for our country to join a 
hemispheric free trade pact extending all the way from Alaska to 
Patagonia. In the short run, we should strengthen our 
subregional accords and our compliance with the obligations we 
have undertaken by joining GATT. 
  9. Negotiate with the International Monetary Fund, the World 
Bank, and the Multilateral Agencies to profit from all the 
advantages offered by these organizations. In particular, we 
should seize the opportunity to strengthen our international 
reserves. 
  10. Make educational reform a national priority. It is 
particularly important to emphasize the training of human 
resources to ensure that Venezuelan workers will have access to 
better jobs and higher pay. The 10 points I have proposed here 
could be reduced to three very specific proposals: 

  -  Produce more foreign exchange. 
  -  Manage it better. 
  -  Ensure 
that everyone will have a share in our national wealth, 
primarily through education. 

  I contend that "a climate of understanding among all the 
players on the national stage will contribute to the development 
of this program." "If we do things right, and if we tell the 
country the truth right up front, we will win the confidence 
battle, and we will put Venezuela on the road to economic 
progress and social prosperity," he concluded.

<F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Braulio Sanchez, judge of the 26th Criminal Trial 
Court, ruled on the cases of the Construction, Barinas, and 
Bancor Banks at 1715 this Friday. He also issued arrest warrants 
for the Construction Bank Board of Directors, including its 
president, Jose Dimase. 
  [Begin Sanchez recording] I decree the legal arrest of 
citizen Jose Gustavo Dimase Urbaneja for the crimes of 
preparing, signing, authorizing, certifying, presenting, and 
publishing inaccurate balance accounts or financial statements, 
which are contained in and penalized under Article 293 of the 
General Banking and Other Financial Institutions Law. He is also 
charged with repeatedly obtaining benefits and continuously 
diverting money granted by public organizations. These actions 
are penalized in accordance with Part 2, Article 61, of the 
Protection of Public Property Law. 
  An arrest warrant has been issued for Elio Tamir Maracano, 
former executive vice president of the Construction Bank at the 
time, for the same crimes described above. 
  An arrest warrant has been issued for Saul Uribe, vice 
president of accounting of the Construction Bank, for the crimes 
of preparing, signing, authorizing, certifying, presenting, and 
publishing inaccurate balance accounts or financial statements, 
which are contained in and penalized under Article 293 of the 
General Banking and Other Financial Institutions Law. 
  An arrest warrant has been issued for Carlos Alberto Blanco, 
vice president of operations of the Construction Bank, for 
preparing, signing, authorizing, certifying, presenting, and 
publicizing inaccurate balance accounts or financial statements 
and for obtaining benefits and diverting money granted by public 
organizations. 
  An arrest warrant was issued for (Mauro McNeil Yak Jones), 
Construction Bank director, for continuously obtaining benefits 
and diverting money granted by public organizations, penalized 
under Part 2, Article 61, of the Protection of Public Property 
Law. 
  A judicial arrest warrant has been issued for Carmen Elisa 
Sosa Perez, manager of the Intercom Financial Bank N.V. of the 
Construction Bank, for obtaining benefits and diverting money 
granted by public organizations. [end recording] 
  Judge Braulio Sanchez said the arrest warrants do not mean 
these individuals took funds granted to their organizations by 
Fogade [Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund] but, 
rather, that they did not use them properly. He said the Fogade 
funds, concerning the Construction Bank, were used to purchase 
dollars on the exchange market.

<F P=106> [Article by Raul Chacon Soto] </F>
  [Text] The private manufacturing sector saw its production 
levels plummet in the first quarter of this year to 22.4 percent 
below the figure for the same period in 1993. Employment fell 
8.8 percent, that is, by 40,512 jobs from the total recorded in 
December of last year, according to the latest survey of the 
industrial situation. 
  In fact, the director of the Center for Information, 
Documentation, and Reference of Conindustria, Rogelio Carrillo 
Penso, explained that despite the slight uptick with respect to 
the fourth quarter of 1993 (the net balance jumped from 2.44 
percent to 5.4 percent), industrial production has been sliding 
since March of last year, when a figure of 27.8 percent was 
recorded. 
  He explained that the biggest impediment to an increase in 
production is the weakness of demand, which limits the 
possibility of passing on higher costs in the prices of goods, 
reduces the profit margin, weakens businesses, and shrinks 
employment. 
  Carrillo stated that the industry's employment capacity is 
still declining. "Industrial employment has dropped by 109,964 
since the first quarter, a decrease of 20.7 percent." 
  He indicated that as of March of this year, 421,131 persons 
were employed, the second-lowest figure in the nine years that 
the industrial survey has been conducted. The lowest figure was 
393,248, recorded in the first quarter of 1989. 
  The survey also revealed that the sectors reporting the most 
employees were foods, beverages, and tobacco; textiles and 
clothing, chemicals, coal, rubber, and plastic. The regions 
where the most jobs are concentrated are the capital (191,511) 
and the central region (121,873). 
  Another indication that this sector is in crisis is the weak 
backlog of orders, which fell 21.8 percent compared to the first 
quarter of 1993, and 5.9 percent with respect to December of 
last year. 
  The document submitted by Corpoindustria states that both 
production and demand declined due to the effects of inflation. 
"This variable has increased this quarter with respect to 1993, 
since the bolivar depreciated. It is at 22.08 percent for this 
period, compared to 33.08 percent in 1993." 
<H5>  Other Indicators </H5>
  The director of Conindustria explained that, as a result of 
the contraction of demand, businesses have had to implement 
measures to deal with their financial situation and cut costs. 
  In this regard, expectations for the general situation and 
for investments declined by 19 and 17 points, respectively, 
compared to the same quarter of last year, and are now at 21.33 
percent and 20.47 percent. "This decrease has been caused by the 
economic uncertainty that prevails in the country." 
  The nation's utilized capacity has grown since the fourth 
quarter of 1993, from 57.36 percent to 58.34 percent in the 
initial months of 1994. Other important indicators are those 
related to stocks of raw materials (a slight increase, 0.9 
percent over the first quarter of 1993), inventories of finished 
goods (a 6.8-percent jump during the same period), and prices of 
raw materials and imports (up 98.16 percent and 86.58 percent, 
respectively).

<F P=106> [Article by Adriana Cortes] </F>
  [Excerpts] The report by the Evaluation Commission 
appointed by President Rafael Caldera to diagnose the ills of 
basic industry enterprises indicates in its final conclusions 
regarding the mining sector that the Venezuelan Corporation of 
Guayana (CVG) should have more control over the country's mines. 
This would mean transferring to the CVG some of the powers now 
exercised by the Ministry of Energy and Mines. 
  The document contains a recommendation that the national 
nature of property ownership should be retained in the mining 
sector, which has a great deal of potential for the country. For 
this reason, administrative procedures should be adopted to 
assign to the CVG all tasks related to the administration, 
provision of services, control, supervision, and monitoring of 
mining properties. 
  The commission, which was headed by Asdrubal Baptista, 
minister for economic reform, suggested in its report that the 
Ministry of Energy and Mines should maintain control over the 
granting of mining concessions, and that improvements should be 
made in the legal aspects of that mechanism. The CVG would deal 
with administrative matters as well as monitoring and overseeing 
mining, in accordance with legislation. 
  The report contains an expose making it clear that not 
enough 
control has been exercised over the mining areas in the region, 
and that functions should be clearly delineated and carried out 
more strictly. 
  "It is a question, then, of designing a system in which the 
Venezuelan Corporation of Guayana carries out all administrative 
procedures with respect to investigating and confirming 
compliance with regulations, and improving the legalities of 
granting mining concessions should be left up to the Ministry of 
Energy and Mines. Moreover, in this model, the CVG would be 
responsible for all monitoring and overseeing of the mining 
itself." [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Guarantees for Workers </H5>
  Another important conclusion in the Evaluation Commission's 
report -- although it has not received a lot of attention -- has 
to do with industrial management. It proposes that a significant 
percentage of the shares in the industrial firms of the CVG be 
used as compensation in lieu of benefits to public employees who 
opt for early retirement. 
  The clarification of providing a guarantee for workers can 
be 
deduced from one of the well-publicized conclusions of the 
report, the one referring to the privatization of basic industry 
enterprises. The offer of shares would be limited, in this case, 
to employees who retire from their jobs, and would serve as 
partial payment of the various benefits to which they are 
entitled. 
  In addition, to keep the CVG from completely abandoning 
social and labor programs after the decentralization and 
privatization take place, the commission proposes that a 
significant amount of the proceeds the state receives from the 
sale of its property be used to finance a Permanent Occupational 
Education Plan, as well as job retraining and continuing 
education programs, in which private industry would participate. 
  One noteworthy aspect of the report is that it does not rule 
out the possibility that the entities associated with the 
Venezuelan Corporation of Guayana may be privatized under the 
Privatization Law. 
  The document, signed by Minister for Economic Reform 
Asdrubal 
Baptista, states that "the legal nature of the process that will 
lead to the desired objectives should be made very clear, and it 
should be established whether the provisions of the current 
Privatization Law, which could hinder the process, are to be 
applied here, or whether other, more effective and expeditious 
avenues can be opened up." 
  Another major difference between this plan and the ones the 
CVG has advanced so far is the fact that it does not exclude the 
possibility that even electric companies could be privatized 
some day, once total maturity is achieved, without harming 
rational economic interests.

<F P=106> [From the "Seven O'Clock Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] A preliminary investigation into the controversial 
and revealing narco telephone conversation between journalist 
Alberto Giraldo and Cali Cartel boss Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela 
shows that it is very likely that the recording was made from 
one of the telephones of the two speakers. In turn, the 
recording probably did not result from a wiretap installed by a 
third party. 
  According to what the "Seven O'Clock Newscast" has been able 
to learn, a preliminary report by the Prosecutor General's 
Office, which was based on a report by DAS [Administrative 
Department of Security] experts in wire tapping, shows that the 
narco-cassette was recorded by one of the two speakers. This 
means that journalist Alberto Giraldo or Rodriguez Orejuela 
intentionally recorded their conversations from one of their own 
telephones. 
  The Prosecutor General's Office has been unable to determine 
which of the two made the recording. The sound has been found 
to be so clear that the recording had to be made with the use of 
a radio studio console. This information will be verified and 
reconfirmed within the next few days by Prosecutor General 
Gustavo de Greiff, and it could radically alter the course of 
the investigation. 
  The Prosecutor General's Office today insisted on summoning 
the people mentioned in the recording to come forward and 
testify.

<F P=106>   [News conference by Andres Pastrana, former Colombian </F>
presidential candidate of the New Democratic Force party, with 
unidentified domestic and foreign reporters; place not given; 
broadcast in progress -- live] 
  [Editorial Report] Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol 
Network in Spanish at 1519 GMT on 22 June broadcasts a news 
conference by Andres Pastrana. Pastrana begins by saying, "the 
president-elect is lying when he tried to implicate the campaign 
of Andres Pastrana and Luis Fernando Ramirez in drug trafficking 
activities." He then adds: "That is why I convened this news 
conference; to set the record straight." 
  Pastrana comments on audio cassette recordings of 
individuals 
allegedly linking Pastrana's and President-elect Samper's 
presidential campaigns to drug money. He then reads a 
statement, which begins by noting that "on 15 June at the 
Intercontinental Hotel in Cali, when leaving a banquet offered 
by Valle del Cauca political leaders, a person delivered a tape 
to me saying it was important." Pastrana then gives a 
chronology of the events leading up to the disclosure of the 
cassette recordings. Pastrana later reads a letter he sent to 
Samper asking him to rebut charges drug money was being used for 
his electoral campaign if there was nothing to hide, "a thing he 
did not do." 
  Pastrana explains that he refused to use this recording for 
electoral purposes. He states: "Knowing about this tape before 
the elections, the cassette was not used for electoral 
purposes." Pastrana plays a portion of the tape recording 
featuring two unidentified speakers. The text of the recording 
is as follows: 
  [First speaker] "Hello?" 
  [Second speaker] "Hello, how are you?" 
  [First speaker] "Okay, my brother. 
  [Second speaker] "What do you have?" 
  [First speaker] "The best of news." 
  [Second speaker] "[Words indistinct] I am awake." 
  [First speaker] "Yes?" 
  [Second speaker] "Yes." 
  [First speaker] "Okay." 
  [Second speaker] "Where are you?" 
  [First speaker] "I am at [words indistinct]." 
  [Second speaker] "Okay." 
  [First speaker] "[Words indistinct] the car?" 
  [Second speaker] "It will leave at approximately 1000, my 
brother. Here they do not allow anyone to leave before 1000, you 
understand?" 
  [First speaker] "Yes. 
  [Second speaker] "There are restrictions there, and they do 
not allow you to leave. [Words indistinct]. The car will be 
arriving there at a quarter to 12." 
  [First speaker] "[Words indistinct]." 
  [Second speaker] "I can anticipate that. By 1100 or 1200 
sharp, the car will be in line. [Words indistinct]." 
  [First speaker] "Perfect." 
  [Second speaker] "Here we are, here we are..." 
  [First speaker, interrupting] "No, no, no. It does not 
matter, it does not matter, it does not matter." 
  [Second speaker] [Words indistinct]. 
  [First speaker] "Look, I met with the old man." 
  [Second speaker] "Good." 
  [First speaker] "I have the best news in the world." 
  [Second speaker] "Uh-huh." 
  [First speaker] "The best." 
  [Second speaker] "Yes." 
  [First speaker] "[Words indistinct] a hug." 
  [Second speaker] "Okay." 
  [First speaker] "[Words indistinct] is a son of a bitch." 
  [Second speaker] [Words indistinct]. 
  [First speaker] "Huh?" 
  [Second speaker] [Words indistinct]. 
  [First speaker] "Yes, more or less." 
  [Second speaker] "[Words indistinct] he spoke?" 
  [First speaker] "Yes, more or less." [laughs] 
  [Second speaker] "Why have you not called Fats Garcia 
again?" 
  [First speaker] "Oh no. That telephone has me by the balls, 
man." 
  [Second speaker] "He says he called you." 
  [First speaker] [Words indistinct]. 
  [Second speaker] "It is true you were collecting from [words 
indistinct] because [words indistinct] from the..." 
  [First speaker, interrupting] "From the big stick?" [laughs] 
  [Second speaker] "Yes. I found that he was sort of, sort 
of..." 
  [First speaker, interrupting] "No, no, no. Look, I have been 
doing an artful [bellaco] job. But look, today he is going to 
make a base and (?verify) it for me." 
  [Second speaker] [Words indistinct]. 
  [First speaker] "More or less." 
  [Second speaker] [Words indistinct]. 
  [First speaker] "Yes, more or less." 
  [Second speaker] [Words indistinct]. 
  [First speaker] "More or less." 
  [Second speaker] "I will tell you how things went when you 
get here." 
  [First speaker] "Huh?" 
  [Second speaker] "I will tell you how things went when you 
get here." 
  [First speaker] [Passage indistinct]. 
  [First speaker] "Yes, I conversed this morning..." 
  At this point, Pastrana interrupts the recording to say: 
"Continue, continue a little more." The tape continues: 
  [Second speaker] "Try to call Alvaro." 
  Pastrana then interrupts the tape again to explain that his 
campaign treasurer had turned down an offer, conveyed by 
journalist Alberto Giraldo, from "some people in Cali who wished 
to donate money for the campaign of Andres Pastrana." Pastrana 
then continues playing the tape: 
  [First speaker] "[Words indistinct] it is all arranged. 
[Words indistinct] I am going to tell you." 
  [Second speaker] [Words indistinct]. 
  [First speaker] "Yes, of course. I spoke with him (?last 
night). I am going to call El Gordo now." 
  [Second speaker] [Words indistinct]. 
  At this point, Pastrana interrupts the tape and states the 
following: 
  "They also referred to Dr. Alvaro Pava. My interpretation of 
this is that Journalist Giraldo said something about part of a 
whole. Dr. Alvaro Pava [words indistinct] he did not manage 
money and he was not the treasurer. Alvaro Pava [words 
indistinct] established contact with different regions to decide 
on plans for election day. Thus, I also want to make clear that 
I personally believe he is referring here to something different 
to that which was described as part of the whole. I do not know 
what the whole refers to, but I want to make clear that the only 
person in charge of handling my campaign funds was Dr. Hernan 
Beltz." 
  Pastrana continues playing the tape: 
  [First speaker] "[Words indistinct] a call" [passage 
indistinct]. 
  [Second speaker] "I talked to Maza." 
  [First speaker] "Yes." 
  [Second speaker] "He [words indistinct] after what I told 
him, but I hope he gives it to me in cash." 
  [First speaker]] [Words indistinct]. 
  [Second speaker] "I hope he gives it to me in cash, to 
deliver it tomorrow." 
  [First speaker] [Words indistinct]. 
  [Second speaker] "Good, Okay." 
  At this point, Pastrana interrupts the tape again to say: 
"Now, let us listen to the other conversation." The tape 
recording continues with a discussion between two unidentified 
inidividuals. 
  [First speaker] [Words indistinct]. 
  [Second speaker] "What happened?" [passage indistinct]. 
  [First speaker] "Did you already go?" 
  [Second speaker] "Yes." 
  [First speaker] "Really, did you already go?" 
  [Second speaker] "Yes." 
  [First speaker] [Words indistinct]. 
  [Second speaker] "No, because [words indistinct] I forget 
the 
name. [30-second passage indistinct] 
  [First speaker] "Wait just a second; let me [words 
indistinct] to confirm it. Wait just a second." 
  [Second speaker] "Hello." 
  [First speaker] "Hello." 
  [Second speaker] "How is it going?" 
  [First speaker] "Very good, very good." 
  [Second speaker] "The man urgently needs money." 
  [First speaker] "Who?" 
  [Second speaker] "The man." 
  [First speaker] "Eduardo?" 
  [Second speaker] "Yes." 
  [First speaker] "He already sent us an emissary." 
  [Second speaker] [Words indistinct]. 
  [First speaker] "Yes, yes." 
  [Second speaker] "Is he the same one I know?" 
  [First speaker] "Yes, yes, yes." 
  [Second speaker] "There are a few little problems here." 
  [First speaker] "Ah." 
  [Second speaker] "Because they want everything, everything, 
everything, everything, everything." 
  At this this point, Pastrana again interrupts the tape 
recording to say: "This is the only part that is not included 
in the EL TIEMPO transcripts, the man's name [words indistinct]. 
I do not know who they are talking about. This is one of the 
few passages missing from the EL TIEMPO transcripts." Pastrana 
continues playing the tape recording: 
  [First speaker] "Where is he now?" 
  [Second speaker] "I am not so sure." 
  [First speaker] [Words indistinct]. 
  [Second speaker] "Eduardo?" 
  [First speaker] "Eduardo is mentioned" [ passage 
indistinct]. 
  [Second speaker] "Remain calm; I will personally explain 
it." 
  [First speaker] "[Words indistinct] depends on how you see 
things; you are going to [words indistinct]." 
  [Second speaker] "Yes, but this is also a silly thing." 
  [First speaker] "[Words indistinct] to talk, because [words 
indistinct]." 
  [Second speaker] "This is one thing, and the other is 
another 
thing. 
  [First speaker] [Words indistinct]. 
  [Second speaker] "There are five points that are basic 
appointments. Right? 
  [First speaker] [Words indistinct]. 
  [Second speaker] "[Words indistinct] there are five points 
there. This is basic." 
  [First speaker] "Yes. [passage indistinct]." 
  [First speaker] "I already talked to his brother, and I will 
talk to Eduardo tomorrow. [passage indistinct]." 
  [First speaker] "Yes, but not by telephone. [passage 
indistinct]." 
  [Second speaker] "What did he tell Medina?" 
  [First speaker] "Well, I talked to Medina last week, and 
this 
week we will [word indistinct] what we talked." 
  [Second speaker] "But, didn't you [words indistinct]." 
  [First speaker] "Yes. If he is there tomorrow, we will send 
him some money on Monday and the rest next week. [passage 
indistinct]" 
  [First speaker] "It depends on how you see things [words 
indistinct]." 
  [Second speaker] [Words indistinct]. 
  [First speaker] "Then why is Medina saying that is what 
those 
from Santo Domingo want to give him?" 
  [Second speaker] "No, it was not that way." 
  [First speaker] "That is what he told us that day." 
  [Second speaker] [Words indistinct]. 
  [First speaker] "All that they [words indistinct]." 
  [Second speaker] [Words indistinct]. 
  [First speaker] "No, but you cannot fix our lives." 
  [Second speaker] "Oh, but..." 
  [First speaker, interrupting] "That is the problem. That is 
the small..." 
  [Second speaker] [Words indistinct]. 
  [First speaker] "The day you are the presidential candidate 
and you have 47 percent of the opinion in your favor, not only 
[words indistinct]. The change will be made?" 
  [Second speaker] "The change will be made the day after 
Samper wins. As soon as Samper wins..." 
  [First speaker, interrupting] "As soon as Samper wins [words 
indistinct]." 
  [Second speaker] "The change will be made the day after 
Samper wins. All four of us [words indistinct] decided what 
gift we will give him. [Words indistinct] The day after Samper 
wins, however, [words indistinct]." 
  [First speaker] "[Words indistinct] have scared the guys. 
[Words indistinct] in the coast was really tremendous." 
  [Second speaker] "You mean the thing with Maza?" 
  [First speaker] "Right." 
  [Second speaker] "Remember, however, that Maza did not get 
the votes he was supposed to get. He was split in half when he 
got [words indistinct] with one and the other prior to the 
elections. [Words indistinct] he had more votes." 
  [First speaker] "How many votes?" 
  [Second speaker] "No, no, he had more votes. He had 100,000 
votes that day and about 40,000 people left him [words 
indistinct]. What I want to tell you is that what he got was 
very, very important [words indistinct]. I believe we achieved 
something that is being highly appreciated [words indistinct]. 
We will talk tomorrow then?" 
  [First speaker] "Yes, we will talk tomorrow." 
  [Second speaker] "When does [words indistinct]?" 
  [First speaker] "On Friday." 
  [Second speaker] [Words indistinct]. 
  [First speaker] "No, no, no. We will talk here. [Words 
indistinct] do not get panicky. Now, you will start calling 
your brother and asking [words indistinct]." 
  [Second speaker] "No, no, no. [Words indistinct]." 
  [First speaker] "[Words indistinct] Do not tell anything to 
Eduardo or anybody else, please." 
  [Second speaker] "I will not." 
  [First speaker] "Please, I beg you, to nobody." 
  [Second speaker] "[Words indistinct] we are not fools. We 
know how to do things." 
  [First speaker] "At this moment, [words indistinct] you know 
it is not true. That is what I am telling you [words indistinct] 
but we are doing things correctly." 
  [Second speaker] "Eduardo sat down with the big ones in both 
campaigns. They agreed, he told me yesterday. It is a promise 
and it has to be kept. They are the guarantors of this 
commitment. We will go to Europe to talk to him. We will 
define things then and see how things will be done." 
  [First speaker] "Well, [words indistinct] see you tomorrow." 
  At this point, there is a pause in the recording with an 
unidentified speaker making inaudible comments. The following 
recording is then played: 
  [First speaker] "Hello, hello?" 
  [Second speaker] "Hello. Hi, Alberto, how are you?" 
  [First speaker] "Well, how are you?" 
  [Second speaker] [Words indistinct]. 
  [First speaker] "They have me all screwed up." 
  [Second speaker] [Words indistinct]. 
  [First speaker] "[Words indistinct] in the press." 
  [Second speaker] "[Words indistinct] it is Saturday." 
  [First speaker] "No, I mean the newspaper." 
  [Second speaker] "When?" 
  [First speaker] [Words indistinct]. 
  [Second speaker] "What did he say?" 
  [First speaker] "I am a government spokesman [words 
indistinct] in the sense of getting General Maza involved in 
that thing. It is a very dirty trick, don't you think?" 
  [Second speaker] "Yes." 
  [First speaker] "Send for that newspaper [words 
indistinct]." 
  [Second speaker] "Yes, I will send for it." 
  [First speaker] "Send for it right away." 
  [Second speaker] "[Words indistinct] I sensed something 
[words indistinct]. You have to be calm about this." 
  [First speaker] "No, no, no. I am not..." 
  [Second speaker, interrupting] "It is nothing bad. In any 
case, you are not going to make an issue of this, right?" 
  [First speaker] "No, no, no. I am already..." 
  [Second speaker, interrupting] "Do not let those sons of 
bitches get to you. [words indistinct]." 
  [First speaker] "[Words indistinct] said I had given a lunch 
[words indistinct] for the meeting with Maza. I want to tell 
you, however, that I talked to the man. He is thrilled, at 
ease, and very happy because the tour of Santa Marta was very 
good, very positive, and it had good results because all the 
people attended it. 
  ``Guillermo called this morning to say that the situation 
with the press should be stopped because [words indistinct] they 
are sons of a bitches. [Words indistinct] he told me: I am very 
happy. We are going to win. There will be a big mobilization. 
  ``[Words indistinct] but here we go anyhow. Another issue 
is [words indistinct] and [words indistinct] of the secretary 
said that tomorrow we will go to [words indistinct].'' 
  [Second speaker] "[Words indistinct] what have they got?" 
  [First speaker] "He spoke for both of them, for the two 
trips, for No. 1 and for the one who will be No. 1 and [words 
indistinct] and he gave him carte blanche to negotiate." 
  [Second speaker] [Words indistinct] 
  [First speaker] "(Fidel Velasquez) [not further 
identified]." 
  [Second speaker] "[Words indistinct] I have told (Augusto 
Lara) [not further identified] to [words indistinct] a friend of 
the one who was listening, and all for nothing. It was the same 
tiresome talk about him not persecuting anybody, that this 
[words indistinct] pressure [words indistinct] gave others some 
son-of-a-bitch reasons. Who is exerting pressure here? 
[passage indistinct] 
  [Second speaker] "[Words indistinct] have been willing to 
comply at any moment. We have tried to find ways to cooperate. 
Either person has the opportunity to [words indistinct]". 
  [First speaker] "We will talk about this tomorrow." 
  [Second speaker] [Words indistinct] 
  [First speaker] "[Words indistinct] do what must be done. I 
am not questioning you; do what you must." 
  [Second speaker] "[Words indistinct] more bars and more 
fiestas [words indistinct] they met, talked, [words indistinct] 
but this is a very serious commitment [words indistinct]." 
  [First speaker] "Manolo [words indistinct] to them. [laughs] 
[words indistinct] Then, tomorrow I..." 
  [Second speaker, interrupting] "Let them look deep into 
their 
hearts and say whether or not we have been honorable people who 
want peace, order, and justice and [words indistinct] the best." 
  [First speaker] "Tell me one simple thing: We are going to 
have dinner with you tomorrow afternoon, right?" 
  [Second speaker] "Yes, yes, but do not bring too many people 
in one of those peppy entourages of yours." 
  [First speaker] "Only he and I are going." 
  [Second speaker] "There you have it." 
  [First speaker] "Look, this is important because of [words 
indistinct]." 
  [Second speaker] "[Words indistinct] one thing. It is bad 
because of [words indistinct] it is bad to say [word 
indistinct]. You have been there, and you have a voice. We are 
here. I do not know [words indistinct] to tell lies. [Words 
indistinct] that you are not a son of a bitch." 
  [First speaker] "Of course not! Of course not!" 
  [Second speaker] "Then you will come up with a story -- the 
same story as always. You will always find that kind of people." 
  [First speaker] "Of course not!" 
  [Second speaker] "The president should begin [words 
indistinct] we are doing nothing illegal, nothing outside the 
law. These are decent people -- people who want to go legit, who 
have helped such and such kind of people. [Words indistinct] 
without finishing what he was going to do." 
  [First speaker] "I want you to deliver a message." 
  [Second speaker] "You spoke with Augusto also. That was a 
disgrace. They used me. A couple of friends asked me to lend 
[words indistinct]. What else could I do?" 
  [First speaker] "[Words indistinct] Gato." 
  [Second speaker] "Gato is dangerous [words indistinct]." 
  [First speaker] "You did not send me the money [words 
indistinct]." 
  [Second speaker] "[Words indistinct] has it. [Words 
indistinct] and I saw her looking so squalid that I spent half 
of it [words indistinct]." 
  [First speaker] "Now, brother. Now." 
  [Second speaker] "[Words indistinct] creates unrest and 
[words indistinct]." 
  [First speaker] [Words indistinct] 
  [Second speaker] "[Words indistinct] to make friends." 
  [First speaker] "And the six current cases?" 
  [Second speaker] "Mrs. Casco says she is going to send 
them." 
  [First speaker] "No, because they have red." [sentence as 
heard] 
  [Second speaker] "[Words indistinct] do not." 
  [First speaker] "Are you sure?" 
  [Second speaker] "[Words indistinct] There is no need. 
Fortunately there is no need. [Word indistinct] now we have to 
send that to Alberto [words indistinct]." 
  [First speaker] "Do you have other things?" 
  [Second speaker] "We sent a copy to LA PRENSA." 
  [First speaker] "Okay." [laughs] 
  [Second speaker] "Do not worry about that or run any 
publicity [words indistinct]." 
  [First speaker] "Look, something amazing just happened. I 
spoke to LA REPUBLICA, and they said this is your home and that 
we have known for many years that you are a friend of these 
people. [Words indistinct] they were very good after all of the 
lies throughout the campaign." 
  [Second speaker] "Why not publish all of the meetings with 
the informers? The people from Norte del Valle donated $2 
million." 
  [First speaker]) [Words indistinct] 
  [Second speaker] Let us start investigating to find out what 
happened in order that they can cancel support." 
  [First speaker] "If that turns out to be true, then all hell 
will break loose." 
  [Second speaker] "That is it for now." 
  [First speaker] "Ciao." 
  After playing the recording, Pastrana says: "At no time does 
the recording refer to donations to my campaign." He then says 
he received a call from the prosecutor general, asking him to 
confirm the delivery of the tape to President Gaviria, and he 
says he will confirm this delivery. Pastrana says "it cannot be 
inferred that my campaign requested or received offers of drug 
money from the tapes." 
  Pastrana says, "If it is proven that the Colombian 
president-elect's campaign received funds from drug traffickers, 
he will relinquish the mandate he received from the people; 
otherwise his credentials will be distorted." 
  When questioned on whether he is asking Dr. Samper to 
resign, 
Pastrana asserts: "If it is confirmed that drug money was used 
for his campaign, he should be ready to resign the presidency, 
as I would be if I won the election and if my campaign had 
received drug money." When asked how can he assure he did not 
receive Cartel money, Pastrana says: "Do you think I would go to 
the president of the Republic to tell him, here is a tape that 
compromises me, please investigate me." He continues: "Three 
days before the elections I made a clear proposal. After 
learning about the tape, I said I was willing to resign if it 
were proven that there was drug money in my campaign." 
  Pastrana explains he is not hesitant to surrender the 
accounting books of his campaign, adding: "Those books are 
always open. In my case, we have not only turned the books over 
to the supervisory commission but also to the National Electoral 
Council, which closes out electoral campaign books." When asked 
if he would be willing to cooperate with the Samper 
administration if it is confirmed that Samper did not receive 
drug money, Pastrana says: "I personally do not hope to 
participate in the Samper administration." 
  Pastrana asserts: "No one in the world can say my campaign 
was funded by drug money." When asked about General Maza's 
involvement in this affair, Pastrana responds: "This is 
worrisome; there are statements in the recording that are very 
worrisome. It is up to the public to assess these statements." 
  Responding to a question, Pastrana states: "More than 
thinking about a deterioration of relations with the United 
States, the country demands that this matter be clarified." 
When questioned on whether he is ready to lead a campaign to 
force the resignation of a corrupt president similar to 
campaigns in Brazil and Venezuela, Pastrana says: "I would 
rather wait for the results of the investigation." 
  Pastrana concludes his news conference at 1622 GMT by 
stating 
that he has received death threats from the drug cartels and by 
answering questions on the upcoming soccer match between 
Colombia and the United States.

  [Text] Journalist Alberto Giraldo Lopez spoke with an EL 
TIEMPO reporter by telephone to give an account of the 
controversial conversation he had with members of the Cali 
cartel. 
  He said it seemed "unfair to Samper, a president who won the 
elections honestly, to find himself involved in such a mess." 
He emphasized that "the transcript you published does not 
include the part where I said that neither of the two campaigns 
received money." 
  Giraldo explained that he had spoken to the Rodriguez 
Orejuela brothers and asked them to contribute to the campaigns. 
"They gave me discretionary powers," he said, adding that he 
had met with Santiago Medina, treasurer of the Samper campaign, 
through Eduardo Mestre. "Eduardo had no connection to the 
campaign, but he is an important member of the Liberal Party," 
he said. 
  Giraldo added: "Two days later I spoke with Medina, and he 
declined the offer, saying that the campaign was being conducted 
very honestly and that there was an overseer and an ethical 
prosecutor. Unfortunately, no definite decision was reached." 
  Giraldo said he also had breakfast with Hernan Beltz, 
financial director for Pastrana's campaign, and made him the 
same offer. Like Medina, Beltz consulted with the party's board 
of directors, and their answer was negative. Giraldo added that 
he "later spoke with Alvaro Pava, who told me he would discuss 
the offer with Andres. Pava later gave me a negative answer; 
both sides said no." 
  Giraldo Lopez said he suspects the recording was made by the 
CIA or DEA, adding that he cannot understand why it was given to 
Pastrana in Cali by unidentified individuals instead of to the 
authorities. 
  Giraldo declared "his civil death. I committed civil 
suicide. However, it is unfair that, due to a mistake by a man 
like myself and because of an improper action by foreign 
governments, they should attack Colombia's democracy and taint 
the credentials of a man like Samper, who won the elections 
honestly." 
  Alberto Giraldo Lopez sent the following message to EL 
TIEMPO 
director Hernando Santos: 
  With a great display of publicity, television and radio 
newscasts and the press transcribed excerpts of a telephone 
conversation I held with Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela. 
  People who know me know that for many years I have been a 
friend of the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers, who also count among 
their friends many honest people with whom they discuss various 
issues including politics, which, to a certain extent, affects 
them. During the conversation in question, we discussed 
politics, and the simple truth is the following: 
  I told Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela that I could 
talk with the candidates' treasurers to see if it would be 
possible for them to make campaign contributions in an 
uncompromising manner. 
  In Dr. Ernesto Samper Pizano's camp I spoke with Dr. 
Santiago 
Medina, who refused to consider my proposal, because the 
candidate himself had said that it was essential to keep 
contributions honest and ordered strict internal supervision. 
  In Dr. Andres Pastrana Arango's camp I spoke on two 
occasions 
with Dr. Hernan Beltz Peralta, his campaign manager, and Dr. 
Alvaro Pava Camelo, director of the Sunday elections [Domingo 
Electoral]. Both of them refused the contribution with arguments 
similar to those set forth by Dr. Samper's camp. Both camps 
deemed the contributions unacceptable, and my efforts proved 
useless. 
  I called the same number to inform the Rodriguez brothers of 
this. They said they would respect the campaign treasurers' 
position, although they were not requesting any services in 
return. I responded that at any rate the parties had declined 
the offer in a very courteous manner. Strangely enough, this 
part of the dialogue was withheld; only the part that could harm 
Colombian democracy was published.

  [Text] The National Unions Council, which includes all 
production associations, has released the following communique: 
  1. The democratic process to elect a president of the 
Republic has been honest and has made it possible for the people 
to express their will in accordance with constitutional 
provisions and regulations. The National Unions Council 
therefore reaffirms its support for the process and endorses the 
sovereign decision that has resulted in the election of the 
president of the Republic. 
  2. The Council voices its deep concern about the serious and 
negative consequences resulting from the way in which the 
controversy over the alleged use of drug money in the recent 
electoral campaign has been conducted. 
  3. The Council invites all Colombians to remain calm and 
composed, as required by the circumstances, in analyzing and 
reporting the facts and asks that the Prosecutor General's 
Office promptly reach conclusions in the corresponding 
investigation.

<F P=106> [From "The Midday Newscast"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Colombia is preparing to oppose all campaigns 
aimed at tarnishing and destabilizing the country. President 
Cesar Gaviria, political and private sector leaders, and average 
citizens all issued calls today for a defense of the nation's 
greatness and dignity. 
  Colombia is a large and good country, and most Colombians 
agree with this and oppose those antagonistic citizens who are 
attempting to drive us into pessimism. Not even our national 
soccer team's recent defeats or the calls of cowardice cloaked 
by anonymity will allow anxiety and uncertainty to return to 
Colombia. 
  Every Colombian agrees on one single truth: Colombia is 
greater that those who seek to destroy it. 
  [Begin recording] [President Cesar Gaviria] We must not 
allow 
the cartels to emerge victorious in what constitutes their main 
objectives: to divide allies in the struggle against organized 
crime. When judicial cooperation fails, the cartels win. When 
Colombia's image overseas is tarnished, the cartels win. When 
the credibility of our political leadership is attacked, the 
cartels win. The cartels are quite aware of this. 
  [Vice President-elect Humberto De la Calle Lombana] As the 
president of the Republic pointed out, we also reject all of 
these malicious and ill-intended attacks whose ultimate victim 
will be Colombia. Over the past few days, these malicious and 
ill-intended attacks have been circulating throughout the 
foreign media. 
  [Carlos Arturo Angel, president of the National Association 
of Industrialists] We will continue to work. We simply believe 
that these are unfortunate incidents which damage us, but they 
will not stain our country's name. This is a good country. A 
country of men and women who are determined to forge ahead at 
all times. 
  [Ernesto Lima, president of the Lima Insurance Co.] I am 
quite certain the new administration will know how to direct the 
country toward very optimistic objectives. I am sure that the 
country, which has been properly directed in recent years, will 
continue to be directed adequately by Dr. Ernesto Samper. 
  [Sabas Pretelt de la Vega, president of the National 
Federation of Businessmen] I do not believe that we should 
return to the past days of violence. The business sector is 
willing to support Colombia and the new administration in the 
state modernization process and in all of their attempts to 
strengthen Colombia's institutions. [passage omitted] [end 
recording]

  [Text] Widespread losses were reported on the 28 June 
currency market in Treasury Bonds and on the New York Stock 
Exchange due to the relentless drop in the dollar. Despite the 
opinion of economists that the crisis has yet to reach bottom, 
the value of the dollar on the New York market was under the 
psychological barrier of 100 yen, one of its lowest levels since 
the end of World War II, the result of one of the most serious 
crises in Japanese politics. 
  Specialists believe that the problems in Japan and the 
recovery of the German economy are the main causes for this 
continual drop in the dollar, placing Bill Clinton's 
administration in an embarrassing situation. 
  EFE comments that in spite of the drop in the dollar's value 
in recent years, the commercial trade deficit with Japan has 
continued to increase. In addition, it is believed that the 
dollar's decline deters foreign investments on the New York 
Stock Market and casts doubt on the economic recovery on which 
President Clinton prides himself.

  [Text] Cuba must remain firm and victorious because it is a 
symbol for the peoples of the world, particularly Africa, said 
Marcelino dos Santos, president of the People's Assembly of 
Mozambique, on 27 June. Dos Santos spoke in a ceremony at the 
Afro-Asian-Latin American People's Solidarity Organization 
[AALAPSO] building to mark the 19th anniversary of Mozambique's 
independence. A special first-day stamp cancellation took place 
during the ceremony to mark this significant occasion. Ricardo 
Alarcon, president of the National Assembly of the People's 
Government [ANPP], was in attendance. Marcelino dos Santos spoke 
about the future of Mozambique as well as its role in a 
convulsive Africa. 
  [Begin Dos Santos recording in Portuguese] We can expect a 
bright future because, first of all, the war that destroyed our 
country is in the past; secondly, the great cancers of the 
region -- apartheid in South Africa and the regime of President 
Banda in Malawi -- have been eliminated. In other words, the 
Mozambican people now have all the conditions to reconstruct the 
economic development projects that we had already established 
between 1975 and 1980 in health and education. [end recording]

supported en masse by the Vietnamese people. 
  [LeDuc] "I can tell you the campaign is an example of the 
mobilization that is always seen in Vietnam, and our people's 
awareness and internationalist solidarity with the Cuban people. 
[applause] Therefore, the campaign, like other campaigns, 
involved the large-scale and enthusiastic participation of all 
the Vietnamese people, all young Vietnamese people and children." 
  The closing speech was given by UJC Secretary Juan Contino. 
  [Contino] "Friendship and brotherhood between Cuba and 
Vietnam have been forged by a joint struggle waged for decades, 
as has defense of the most humane system of solidarity that 
exists in the world today. That is precisely why millions of 
children, young people, old people, women, students, and workers 
-- the purest, most representative examples of the Vietnamese 
people -- actively participated in the campaigns of solidarity 
with our homeland." 
  The ceremony was presided over by Jose Ramon Balaguer, 
member 
of the Politburo; Melba Hernandez, a heroine of the Moncada 
Barracks attack; and Ministry of Education officials.

  [Text] On 27 June in Havana, Bolivian Ambassador Juan 
Franklin Anaya Vasquez said that Cuba and Bolivia are currently 
engaged in strengthening political and economic relations. Anaya 
told PRENSA LATINA that Cuba and Bolivia have nearly completed 
an air navigation agreement. The accord, once signed, will allow 
for Cubana de Aviacion and (Lloyd) Aero Boliviano planes to fly 
between La Paz and Havana. Anaya emphasized the importance of 
this accord, based on increased tourism to Cuba, not only from 
Bolivia, but also from other nations of the region's southern 
cone. 
  Anaya added in his statement to PRENSA LATINA that Cuba and 
Bolivia are analyzing increased trade in several areas. La Paz 
is studying the possibilities of a visit with Cuban authorities 
in Havana by Bolivian businessmen, enabling them to identify 
possibilities for investment. Anaya noted that politically, 
Bolivia condemns the inhumane U.S. blockade against Cuba just as 
it condemns other measures that oppress the people. Anaya 
pointed out that in the area of culture, the work done by Cuban 
teachers in all fields has been positive, with emphasis on 
ballet specialists and various artistic groups.

  [Text] The United Nations has allocated funds to foster 
Cuba's efforts and experience against drug trafficking. The 
United Nations will contribute $1.019 million to the Cuban 
program against drug trafficking. This will help to acquire 
supplies and equipment for Interior Ministry units and Customs. 
This was announced in Havana by members of the Cuban Drug 
commission. Dr. Zenaida Osori, first vice minister of Justice, 
pointed out that Cuba's geographical location between suppliers 
and consumers requires constant vigilance. 
  Cuba's efforts in this regard have been praised by diverse 
international organizations. The members of the commission went 
on to explain that the increase in Cuban tourism requires 
maximum quality and that all those involved in the fight against 
drugs are working toward that goal. It was also announced that 
as of 30 December 1993, 79 operations took place and that 
3,364.297 kg of cocaine and 1,353.291 kg of marijuana washed up 
on Cuban shores. So far this year, however, there have been only 
11 cases, not of smuggling, but of foreigners carrying small 
amounts for personal use. 
  The members of the Cuban Drug Commission wonder whether drug 
traffickers have stopped using Cuba as a bridge or if Cuba has 
improved its operations. Cuba is waging the war of good against 
evil.

<F P=106> [Report by Enrique Atienza from Camaguey Province for the </F>
"Exclusive" program] 
  [Text] A deplorable accident occurred at 1030 today at the 
corrugated roof factory in Camaguey Province. The explosion 
occurred at one of the two reactors [reactores] located in the 
factory's pilot plant. These reactors are experimentally used to 
manufacture sulphur resin, which has many uses in the 
construction industry. The explosion injured six workers, two of 
whom are reported in very critical condition, two in critical 
condition, and the rest will be under medical observation for 
the next 24 hours. 
  Marta Sanchez Castellanos, a chemical engineer and 
technologist at the corrugated roof factory, was caught in the 
explosion and suffered third-degree burns, eye injuries, and 
loss of consciousness. Mario de Armas Ligo, a specialist in 
mechanical plant plastics, is also in a critical condition in 
the intensive care burn unit at the Manuel Ascunse Domenech 
Hospital. Osvel Alvarez Basurto, a chemical engineer, and Angel 
Miguel Diaz, a pilot plant operator, are in critical condition, 
according to the team of specialists in charge of them. The two 
patients who present no major complications are Ricardo Cid 
Sanchez, an instrument maker, and Carlos Fonseca Pino, a 
technician in the boiler plant, who was hit by resin particles. 
  The explosion destroyed part of the pilot plant's roof. The 
reactor's mixing vat, which weighs approximately 20 kg, landed 
at a distance of 40 meters. The explosion is being 
investigated, although everything seems to indicate it was the 
result of poor handling techniques.

<F P=106> [Interview with Oridio Caballero, vice minister for </F>
sugarcane, by reporter Diosdado Maso Perez for the "Exclusive" 
program -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Maso] June will end in three days and the 
completion of the spring cane sowing plan will be almost 
impossible to meet. Therefore, I spoke with engineer Oridio 
Caballero, Minaz [Ministry of the Sugar Industry] vice minister 
for sugarcane. The important thing, the vice minister assured 
me, is to continue sowing in July what cannot be sown now. 
Various factors determined the failure to meet the spring sowing 
plans in the country -- rain, fuel, and availability of seed 
with a certain category, meaning seed quality. According to 
Caballero, a supply of seed is now available after the required 
work was done. All steps were taken to prepare a quality seed 
supply. 
  [Caballero] This involves the handling of quality seeds in 
each of the centers; the quality of the hydrothermal treatment 
of these seeds; protection of the seed supplies; adequate 
handling of seed varieties, which is very important; strict 
compliance with phytosanitary measures; qualified and trained 
personnel; attention to workers' social needs; and the aesthetic 
qualities, from the technical agronomical viewpoint, that each 
of the seed supplies must have. 
  [Maso] Vice minister, you know Cubans have a tendency to do 
things sporadically. It would be interesting to know what will 
be done to guarantee that what has been accomplished will not be 
lost. 
  [Caballero] I would say this is a challenge, but we are 
fully 
convinced that we can manage it. First of all, I can tell you 
that within the guidelines we established for the new Basic 
Cooperative Production Units [UBPC's], it was clearly stated 
that the state was responsible for everything dealing with the 
seed varieties and phytosanitary issues. Judging from what we 
have seen around here, what we have seen in all the UBPC's, and 
what we have seen at each of the seed supply centers throughout 
the country, we are convinced that we will accomplish this task 
at the required level, at the prescribed level, from the 
technical viewpoint. I also want to tell you that we are in a 
better position than we were in 1986 and 1988 because we now 
have the thermal treatment plants we did not have back then. Now 
we can guarantee a quality seed system as never before. 
  [Maso] If we have seed, it is necessary to continue sowing, 
not only in June and July, but also in August and September 
because in the end, that is the sugarcane we will have for the 
1995-96 harvest.

<F P=106> [Report by Diosdado Maso from the "Exclusive" program] </F>
  [Text] I am going to speak about the spring sugarcane 
planting program. There are 48 hours left in the month of June. 
The spring sugarcane planting program is unlikely to reach even 
60 percent completion. 
  For some Cubans, this is a recurring ailment. Seen in cold 
blood, this statement is nearly true. In 1994, however, the 
situation has been extremely difficult because the over 7,000 
caballerias still to be planted were subject to constant rain 
since the beginning of April; the fuel shortage that is also 
responsible for the power outages we experience at home; and of 
course, this or that shortages, although to be truthful, 
shortages have not influenced results as much this year. 
  Nonetheless, the sugarcane that should have been planted by 
30 June can and should be planted in July, August, and September 
because, in the end, that is the sugarcane that will be ground 
in the 1995-96 harvest, and it can be planted, I repeat, 
perfectly well. 
  To date, only Pinar del Rio Province has met its spring 
sugarcane planting goal. Havana Province has attained 94 percent 
of its planting goal. Havana has demonstrated aggressiveness in 
this endeavor. It was the only province to meet its limited 
sugar production program and as you can see, is also about to 
complete its spring sugarcane planting program. The worst spring 
planting situation is in Sancti Spiritus Province, with 
39-percent fulfillment; and Villa Clara Province, which has not 
even planted 50 percent of the 2,600 caballerias projected. 
  Planting the projected sugarcane is a life-or-death 
situation 
for Cuba. Sugar continues to be the source of our cash currency 
for any major commercial transaction. Other transactions will be 
covered by tourism, perhaps nickel, and tobacco revenues. Only 
sugar currency, however, fills the bill. This is why, only by 
producing more sugarcane can we acquire more currency. This is 
why the goal now is not to feint, but to plant up to the last 
caballeria, even if it takes up to midnight on New Year's Eve.

  [Text] The second Caribbean Businessmen's Meeting has 
concluded in Santiago de Cuba in an effort to link regional 
trade and the world. All day long, the 250 participants, 
including 115 foreigners, held bilateral meetings which resulted 
in broad cooperation prospects. This is how Mauricio Martin 
described the goal of these meetings: 
  [Begin Martin recording] The idea is for the Caribbean 
Businessmen's Meeting to become a meeting of Caribbean 
businessmen for trade with the world, not only with Cuba. [end 
recording] 
  According to Martin, manager of Lafitel Enterprise, his 
enterprise has already attained this. 
  [Begin Martin recording] Yes, I believe so. We have already 
seen the interest of certain companies. Our goal is of course to 
expand to the Caribbean, either in terms of exports to the 
Caribbean or associations with Caribbean companies to modestly 
fill a niche in the Caribbean market and also to contribute our 
grain of sand to Caribbean integration. [end recording] 
  The meetings were held behind closed doors. Everyone's goal 
is to take advantage of integration conditions and mutual trade. 
As this meeting ended, the Expocaribe-94 Fair began promptly at 
1800. Several countries and dozens of companies are 
participating. This guarantees the success of a fair that 
promises to be better than the previous ones.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Mejia and Carlos Sanabria in Santiago de </F>
Cuba for the "Exclusive" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Mejia] The second Caribbean Businessmen's Meeting 
opened today with the participation of over 100 businessmen from 
13 countries in the area. Carlos Sanabria Marrero, our newsman 
in eastern Cuba, has details on this. Carlitos, we are 
contacting you again for an exclusive scoop. 
  [Sanabria] Yes, Mejia. I am at the Santiago Hotel. Caribbean 
businessmen who participated in the second meeting have just 
heard interesting statements by Cuban experts concerning Cuba's 
trade policy in the Caribbean and their experiences, as well as 
the reality and outlook in the tourism sector, and the 
possibilities and alternatives for air and maritime 
transportation. Comrade Osvaldo Martinez, chairman of the ANPP 
[National Assembly of the People's Government] economic 
commission, and director of the World Economy Research Center, 
is here with me in front of Radio Rebelde's microphones. We will 
hear his opinion about developments at the second businessmen's 
meeting. 
  [Martinez] I believe that, without resorting to rhetoric, I 
can assert that this event is undoubtedly a success. The event 
is being held practically on the eve of the Association of 
Caribbean States' [ACS] creation, which marks a new and higher 
event in the area's integration efforts. 
  [Sanabria] According to some businessmen -- even according 
to 
what former Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley said in his 
speech at the event's opening -- it is predicted that the 
association will be created with Cuba's participation. 
  [Martinez] Yes, that is true. In other words, I think that 
one of the things we have to value about the creation of ACS and 
the efforts toward Caribbean integration is that it is occuring 
based on the Caribbean governments' statements that no Caribbean 
integration is possible without Cuba. This is really important. 
  [Sanabria] Osvaldo, there is an equally important matter: 
This event will be followed by the inauguration of the third 
Caribbean fair -- Expocaribe 94. 
  [Martinez] Yes, that is extremely important. The fair is 
practically a continuation of the businessmen's meeting. 
Bilateral meetings and negotiations should begin tomorrow 
between businessmen and Cuban enterprises and agencies. The fair 
will also begin. 
  [Sanabria] This means that many of the things discussed here 
concerning the possibility of trade with the eastern provinces 
will be determined by the businessmen at the fair. 
  [Martinez] Yes, I believe it is the complement. We are in 
the 
theoretical phase right now, which is obviously necessary. The 
fair will be the practical side of many of the things discussed 
here.

  [Text] The Matanzas power authority predicts power will be 
interrupted for up to eight hours per circuit this week. 
Matanzas consumes more than 2,000 megawatts per day. Sector 
officials report that the conservation program will reduce 
electrical output by about nine megawatts 1000-1100 GMT, 18 
megawatts 1200-2100 GMT, and 45 megawatts 2200-0300 GMT. The 
report indicates that 1,458 megawatts -- 47 percent of the total 
generated amount possible -- is available from the nationwide 
electrical system. Currently in Cuba, six units are being 
repaired, eight remain broken down, and three are having water 
and fuel problems. This amounts to a deficit of 500 megawatts 
during the period of maximum demand. 
  [Havana Radio Reloj Network in Spanish at 1403 GMT on 28 
June 
reports: "GRANMA newspaper reports on 28 June that Unit No. 3 
of the Carlos Manuel de Cespedes Electric Plant in Cienfuegos 
was taken off line from the nationwide electrical system on the 
morning of 27 June for scheduled maintenance. GRANMA adds that 
the work is scheduled to last 35 days and will be undertaken by 
the plant's technicians and workers, as well as by the Basic 
Industry Ministry's electrical plants maintenance enterprise. 
Specialists believe that the Japanese-made unit requires 
extensive maintenance to remedy diverse technological problems 
and to elevate generating capacity from 130 to 158 megawatts. 
The electrical plant's workers have once again pledged to work 
very quickly."]

  [Text] Receiving Haitian refugees aboard a U.S. ship in 
Jamaica's Kingston Harbor costs $120,000 a day, according to the 
25 June SUN-SENTINEL, a Fort Lauderdale, Florida newspaper. The 
use of a Coast Guard patrol boat to process the Haitian people 
costs $2,100 an hour. 
  A flight hour for each of the six helicopters accompanying 
the patrol boat costs $750, the newspaper reports. The operation 
for relief and repatriation of Haitian refugees constitutes the 
Coast Guard's largest operation since the second World War, a 
U.S. Coast Guard official told the newspaper. According to him, 
there have never been so many U.S. warships, from both the Coast 
Guard and the Navy, on the open sea. Eight U.S. ships, 15 Coast 
Guard patrol boats, and hundreds of immigration service members 
are participating in the relief and repatriation operations. The 
U.S. ship, USNS Comfort, which is anchored in Kingston Harbor, 
is temporarily receiving the Haitian refugees to allow them to 
present their political asylum requests to the United States. 
The Haitians, whose requests have been rejected, are repatriated 
to Port-au-Prince. This is what the SUN-SENTINEL reported on 26 
June. It said that $120,000 is spent daily [pauses] must be 
spent daily on Haitian refugees.

headquarters. A group of armed men attacked a military outpost 
atm Camp Perin during the night of 19 June, according to Army 
headquarters. According to a high-ranking officer of the Haitian 
Army, one rebel was killed and the Army sustained one injury. 
The soldier on duty in the Camp Perin subdistrict reportedly 
received a bullet wound in the leg during an exchange of shots 
with the rebels who, it is reported, numbered around 20. 
According to this high-ranking officer of the Haitian Army, 
following the exchanges, the group spread out to the south and 
in Grand-Anse, where they are being pursued by military units. 
In Grand-Anse, a peasant was reported killed by one of the 
rebels who later took his own life. [words indistinct]

<F P=106> [Interview with exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide by </F>
an unidentified FOCUS correspondent; place and date not given: 
"The Military's Game Is Over"] 
  [Text] [FOCUS] What will you do first when you return to 
Haiti? 
  [Aristide] First of all, there must be reconciliation with 
my 
enemies and a judicial reform to reestablish justice. At the 
moment, one can still buy justice. Without money you will not 
get any justice. 
  [FOCUS] The military will not give up so quickly after the 
"Tontons Macoutes" have been reorganized. 
  [Aristide] Judging from my seven months in office, it is 
certainly possible to rule Haiti democratically. You can see 
this alone by the fact that after my election, those Haitians 
who fled under Duvalier returned. I claim that at the moment, 
99.95 percent of the population support me. Many have fled 
abroad again and are just waiting to be able to return. 
  [FOCUS] Nevertheless: Are all the military officers and 
other 
terror troops not a constant threat to you? 
  [Aristide] Many of these people are abused by the Army 
Command. They are just afraid that they themselves will be 
killed. As soon as they realize that there is no point in 
fighting against the world, they will stop. 
  [FOCUS] Will you put the military leaders on trial? 
  [Aristide] No. First of all, I will issue a political 
amnesty. I have committed myself to that on the basis of 
Article 147 of our Constitution. 
  [FOCUS] What role does the United States play in the Haitian 
conflict? 
  [Aristide] With Haiti, the United States has one of the 
poorest countries right on its front door. Almost 76 percent of 
our foreign trade is conducted with the United States. In 
addition, more than 1 million Haitians live in the United 
States, who send about $300 million back to Haiti. If the 
United States, together with Haiti can revive democracy, this 
would be a positive signal for the entire region. In the end, 
the security of this hemisphere depends on what is happening now 
in Haiti. Just think of Venezuela. There the military wanted 
to stage a putsch along the lines of Haiti, but, fortunately, 
they failed. 
  [FOCUS] Did you not expect more help from the United States 
and the United Nations after your ouster? 
  [Aristide] We have decided in favor of a non-violent path. 
With this, we have gained respect. 
  [FOCUS] But recently you demanded a military 
intervention.... 
  [Aristide] No, I have never spoken up in favor of that. I 
still think of a solution with the help of the international 
community. We must finally separate the police from the Army, 
an Army that consists of 7,000 men but devours 40 percent of the 
entire budget. At the moment, there are 10 soldiers for 10,000 
Haitians, but only 1.8 doctors. There is no sense to that. 
  [FOCUS] Recently, you spoke of a "surgical intervention".... 
  [Aristide] I just wanted to say that the international 
community should not just discuss the matter but also do 
something. Only a total embargo can shorten my people's time of 
suffering. Unfortunately, this was imposed only recently. Now 
the military's game is over.

  [Text] Chamber of Deputies President Frantz Robert Monde 
has written President Bill Clinton. As a man of exemplary 
character and deep understanding, I want you to know that the 
Haitian people want peace and well-being and not war and misery. 
Monde writes: They reject dictatorship in any form and only 
want the kind of true democracy that develops over years within 
the framework of their own culture, customs, and history. 
  He continues: Mr. President, why are so many blacks in the 
U.S. Congress so desperate to lead you into military 
intervention against a small, poor, defenseless country? They 
want victory for the U.S. Government and Armed Forces, yet -- as 
Cornet, the French poet, might say -- they remain silent on the 
tragedy of hundreds of thousands of their African brothers dying 
in Rwanda. Monde asks: Mr. President, did you ever question 
their interests and what the Democratic Party has to gain by 
you, as the one representing them at the highest leadership 
level, making this decision?

  [Text] President Aristide is squandering Haitian funds 
frozen in the United States. The president of the Chamber of 
Deputies is adamant about seeing the hidden face of the iceberg 
at all costs. In a letter to the U.S. secretary of state, a copy 
of which reached our editorial desk, the president of the lower 
chamber, Frantz Robert Monde, has called Warren Christopher's 
attention to the steps not taken so far, as well as those taken 
by the office of the Chamber of Deputies with the U.S. State 
Department concerning funds belonging to the Haitian state, 
which are frozen in the United States and are being improperly 
spent by President Aristide. The president of the Chamber adds 
that following a request by the Ministry of Finance commission, 
based on the belief that the Constitution and the laws of a 
state define the rules of the democratic game, the Chamber of 
Deputies found it necessary to address you, Mr. Secretary of 
State, on 26 April 1994, in a letter soliciting an accounting of 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's expenses being paid from 
funds frozen in the United States. 
  The vice president of the National Assembly has taken this 
opportunity to denounce U.S. authorities who, in response to his 
request, take pleasure in demanding a military intervention in 
his country. Monde asks, Would you prevent light from being shed 
on the scandalous character of those expenses, regardless of the 
Constitution and the laws of the Republic of Haiti? Still, and 
despite everything, he explains, I believe in the democratic 
traditions of U.S. institutions, in the greatness and morality 
of the U.S. people who prevent mean-minded personal interests 
and obstruction of the rules of law from undermining the U.S. 
democracy. He says he is convinced that -- thanks to the vision 
of the U.S. secretary of state and the transparency that must 
characterize the management of a state's funds -- the Chamber of 
Deputies will eventually have at its disposal a written 
accounting of the funds spent by President Aristide.

  [Text] Raymond Roy, president of the Chamber of Commerce 
and Industry, issued a press release on 27 June confirming that 
Haitian employers are disgusted with the latest U.S. sanctions 
against Haiti. Roy points out that the list of 250 people that 
was prepared following the imposition of the financial sanctions 
includes handicapped people, children, and even a deceased 
person, most of whom are directly or indirectly linked to the 
institution. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry notes that it 
is disgusted with this carefree and casual attitude and that it 
stands with the victims and asks them to keep their heads high 
and face this difficult period with dignity. The day will come 
when the truth will be told of the dishonest maneuvers leading 
to those sanctions, the press release says.

  [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, 27 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Chiapas 
State government pledged today that in the next 24 hours, it 
will begin to evict peasants and Indians from 462 properties, 
which they have occupied in this southeastern state, authorities 
have reported. 
  Interior Secretary General Rodolfo Ulloa announced that this 
was a pledge made to cattlemen and ranch owners, who, last 
Friday, began demonstrations in Tuxtla Gutierrez, the state 
capital. The pledge supercedes the request made to the Mexican 
Army to intervene and clear the properties, Ulloa Flores stated, 
referring to the occupation of lands in the Chiapas conflict 
zone since 1 January. 
  The state government turned down the request to investigate 
the State Council of Indian and Peasant Organizations (CEOIC) 
for the occupations "because it felt this action should be 
conducted through a direct request by the persons affected", he 
noted. The official added that the response to a list of 
demands submitted by cattlemen and ranch owners includes the 
continuation of negotiations in "appropriate" cases involving 
farms that were taken over before 14 April. The negotiations, 
he said, involve sales, relocations, or evictions from lands 
occupied before 14 April, which is when the government, 
cattlemen, ranch owners, and CEOIC, signed an agreement banning 
occupations as of that date. 
  Evictions will occur if relocation agreements are not 
reached 
with squatters on properties that were occupied before that date 
and have not been put up for sale. He explained that these 
operations will conclude on 31 August. 
  Ulloa Flores said that on Monday, the payment of 
compensatory 
rent was agreed upon to cover damages caused between the date of 
the occupation and the date of the eviction or sale of the 
property. The official said the Chiapas Attorney General's 
Office was also instructed to review prior investigations of 
evictions, damages, thefts, and cattle rustling, and to hand out 
indictments. The secretary general added that the Chiapas 
government's response requests banking institutions to pay 
special attention to the owners of occupied lands. 
  Last Friday, approximately 4,000 cattlemen and small-scale 
ranch owners began demonstrating outside the local town hall to 
demand a solution to the invasion of some 500 properties in the 
conflict zone and to overdue debts. 
  The conflict began on 1 January when the Zapatist National 
Liberation Army (EZLN) took over towns to press Indian demands 
and fought the Mexican Army for 11 days in clashes that left 150 
people dead. In late February and early March, the EZLN held a 
nine-day meeting with Manuel Camacho Solis, the then 
commissioner for peace and reconcilation in Chiapas, and on 12 
June, reiterated its willingness to seek a peaceful solution to 
the conflict. The police have carried out evictions from dozens 
of properties this year in operations resulting in at least 100 
arrests.

  [Text] Mexico City, 27 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- It was officially 
announced today that Mexico has suspended its oil and oil 
derivatives exports to Angola and oil refining and 
transportation equipment to Libya thus abiding by two 
resolutions issued by the United Nations. The agreements, 
published in the Federation's official gazette, state that the 
resolutions signed by the foreign and finance secretaries will 
be implemented beginning tomorrow. 
  The first document states that the measure is in accordance 
with 1993 UN Resolution No. 864, which applies sanctions against 
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA. 
The international organization's resolution bans the sale and 
supply of weapons, material, oil, oil derivatives, vehicles, or 
military equipment to UNITA, whether these products are produced 
in the country or abroad. The agreement also states that the 
ports of Luanda, Lobito, and Namibe and the Luanda, Katumbela, 
Malongo, and Cabinda airports are exempted. 
  The second agreement also published in the official gazette 
states that Mexico will abide by the 1993 UN Resolution No. 883, 
which bans the supply of oil refining and oil transportation 
equipment to Libya. On 11 November 1993, the UN Security 
Council also decided to freeze all of Libya's financial assets 
abroad, including investments, deeds, and dividends. In that 
same document, the international forum agreed to leave out funds 
derived from oil, natural gas, or basic farming products that 
were exported after the resolution entered into effect. 
  It was expected that if by 1 December 1993 Libya did not 
turn 
over to the United States or Great Britain the people suspected 
of placing a bomb in an airplane, which killed 270 persons, the 
airline's worldwide offices would be closed. [sentence as

<F P=106> [By Jose Torres Hernandez] </F>
  [Excerpts] Mexico City, 25 Jun (EFE) -- Ignacio Pichardo 
Pagaza, president of the Institutional Revolutionary Party 
[PRI], told EFE today that the contenders' respect for the 
results of the 21 August presidential election is a fundamental 
premise for avoiding violence. 
  Speaking about the position Mexicans can expect from the PRI 
the day following the elections, Pichardo said: "We are 
committed to scrupulously respecting the results of the votes, 
the people's will as secretly expressed in the polls." 
  Politicians and experts have spoken about the most diverse 
hypothesis as to what will happen after the elections, including 
the possibility of violence once the PRI announces victory while 
the opposition shouts fraud! 
  Pichardo said: "I do not know what is going to happen on 22 
August." He mentioned two premises, though: the Chiapas factor 
as a catalyst of change and a respectful attitude for the votes, 
as a means of avoiding violence as an aftermath of the 
presidential election. 
  He said Chiapas, where an Indian rebellion exploded on 1 
January, gave speed to electoral changes that were in the 
process as a "product of agreements reached by parties in 
response to what society was demanding." He said we must "be 
strict in ensuring that the votes are clear, legal, and 
respected." With these two situations assured, we must work so 
that there is no violence as a result of the elections, he said. 
"We have an impartial and objective framework," he said. 
[passage omitted] 
  Mentioning the Mexican observers, Pichardo said: "These will 
be closely watched elections." He added: "The PRI is satisfied 
because it has admitted we must not only win, but we must also 
be able to convince everyone we won cleanly and lawfully." 
  Pichardo said the PRI "plays a fundamental role in the 
country's democratic progress." He said the reforms "we have 
promoted" are the best evidence the PRI clearly understands that 
the path of an ever improving democracy is an irreversible path. 
  Regarding the political campaign of Ernesto Zedillo, who was 
designated the PRI presidential candidate following the 
assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, Pichardo said he is 
satisfied because confidential PRI polls indicate the margin 
between Zedillo and other candidates "is increasingly wider." 
On 21 August, Mexicans will elect their president, 500 
deputies, 96 senators, and 66 representatives to the Federal 
District Assembly in the country's 300 districts, 40 of which 
are in the Mexican capital. 
  Pichardo said that from a political viewpoint, the PRI 
cannot 
accept the idea it may "lose in any district or admit defeat 
beforehand. This is inadmissible. The idea is to win every 
single district and win the Presidency of the republic by a 
broad margin." He said, however, "I am realistic and admit 
there is intense competition, especially in certain urban 
districts where the tallies are very close, and we have to 
struggle hard to win or recover them, as the case may be." 
  Regarding the future of Chiapas, Pichardo said the peace 
process is the responsibility of the government and the Zapatist 
National Liberation Army. He said the PRI has asked the 
government to seek political mechanisms to renew the dialogue, 
which was officially terminated on 11 June. 
  Pichardo said his party can contribute to the peace process 
"by creating an environment of tolerance, plurality, and calm in 
the framework of which we may proclaim ourselves in favor of the 
search for political, not military, solutions."

<F P=106> [Report by Raul Llanos Samaniego] </F>
  [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas State, 24 Jun -- 
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, presidential candidate for the 
Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), has unveiled to 
southeastern businessmen his economic program for the 1994-2000 
period. The fundamental premises of his plan are respect for 
monetary and fiscal discipline, greater deregulation, war on 
corruption, definition of the state functions, and greater 
Mexican incorporation into the world economy. That program, he 
said, will allow us to grow at a 6 percent rate in 1996 and 
generate from 800,000 to 1 million jobs a year, which is why 
public and private investment will be raised to 25 percent of 
GDP. 
  In attending the Eighth Southeastern Business Forum, 
Cardenas 
Solorzano explained that his program will be made up of three 
complementary and concurrent phases: the orderly transfer of the 
management of the economy, an emergency plan to restore growth 
and create jobs, and, lastly, sustained growth, social 
development, and protection of the environment. 
  The candidate explained that during the first phase of its 
implementation, from September 1994 to June 1995, a package of 
measures will be created to maintain the stability of the 
exchange rate, encourage investment flow, and reevaluate the 
Mexican Government's ties with its foreign partners, 
international organizations, and the banking and commercial 
entities of the countries with which greater economic exchange 
exists. 
  At the same time, Cardenas Solorzano explained that a 
government economic team will be set up with people of great 
technical capacities and recognized integrity and 
professionalism, "who have not joined the economic team that 
designed and implemented the current government's degrading 
economic policy." 
  During the second phase, he said, an emergency plan would be 
implemented to regain growth and create jobs, which would be in 
effect for two years and require resources close to 16 billion 
new pesos. 
  Speaking to approximately 500 businessmen from Mexico's 
southeastern region, he noted that within this context public 
investment will receive a selective, orderly, and soundly 
financed boost, as this investment will serve as the initiator 
of economic reactivation owing to the stimulus it will give to 
local and foreign investments. 
  During the meeting, Cardenas Solorzano indicated that the 
emergency public investment plan will target the following 
priority areas: improving and expanding the road network; 
repairing, equipping, and expanding railroads and ports; 
increasing the capacity to generate energy and refine oil; and 
building and repairing schools, hospitals, housing, and urban 
services. 
  After describing his economic program as "viable, realistic, 
and responsible," the PRD candidate mentioned the sources from 
which the required investment would be financed: savings 
stemming from the elimination of squandered resources, waste, 
unnecessary bureaucracy, and chiefly from the war in the federal 
administration [as published], from which he expects to obtain 
3.2 billion news pesos. 
  Similarly, the financing would come from utilizing the rest 
of the Contingency Fund resources that would make it possible to 
obtain 1.2 billion pesos and a careful handling of the debt, 
sources which he expects will generate 10.6 billion new pesos, 
equivalent to 1 percent of the GDP. 
  "The greater payment of interests would be compensated with 
taxes, as a result of a higher level of economic activity and, 
therefore, of tax collecting," he said. 
  Within his emergency plan, Cardenas Solorzano indicated that 
a new credit policy would be established and for this purpose, 
funds with preferential rates would be channeled to the micro, 
small, and medium businesses. He also proposed fiscal 
incentives for businesses, through actions that will lower the 
cost of production capital, such as accelerated depreciation 
formulas, lifting import controls on capital goods, and reducing 
tariffs on work, farm, and construction vehicles. 
  The third part of the plan, he added, entails launching an 
economic growth program with equality. It will include an 
industrial policy, a policy for rural areas, fiscal, political, 
and social policies, promotion of education, a policy for income 
distribution, and an ecological policy. 
  The meeting is being attended by businessmen from the 
country's southeastern states, who hope to hear the presidential 
candidates of the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI], the 
National Action Party [PAN], and the PRD explain their economic 
proposals to fight poverty and develop not only this region, but 
the entire country. Nevertheless, PRI candidate Ernesto Zedillo 
said he would not attend the meeting. The same situation holds 
true for Finance Secretary Pedro Aspe, who had been scheduled to 
participate the first day of the meeting. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas 
was the only one to present his economic plan. PAN candidate 
Diego Fernandez de Cevallos limited himself to presenting a 
number of diverse measures to economically stimulate this 
geographic area. 
  Speaking to the businessmen, Cardenas stressed that the 
basic 
premise of this program is economic democracy, in other words, 
"production areas goals, which are defined on the basis of the 
interests of the majority of the underprivileged Mexicans and on 
economic decisions in which producers, workers, citizens, and 
government leaders are involved." 
  He proposed a change in the economic strategy, indicating 
that his plan "does not mean returning to the past, limiting the 
role of private enterprise, returning to the state enterprises 
that have already been sold, erecting barricades to foreign 
trade, or closing ourselves to foreign investments." It means, 
he added, making economic decisions democratically and placing 
at the top of all economic priorities, the struggle against 
neglect and injustice, the fight against poverty, and the 
eradication of ignorance. 
  In his economic program, outlined in more than 30 pages, 
Cardenas Solorzano highlighted its four basic tenets. First, he 
said the state must not replace private enterprise nor become 
the absolute director of the economy, "that is why all possible 
investment opportunities will be opened to private enterprise, 
but with the state supplementing these efforts in the areas 
where it is essential." 
  Second, he said there must be constant economic deregulation 
to remove the bureaucratic obstacles that hinder production 
activities, conditions of equality in market competition must be 
created, and monopolies must be fought. 
  His program stresses monetary and fiscal discipline in 
addition to waging an all-out war against corruption in the 
government, the business sector, unions, and other production 
and service sectors. 
  The last point of his program is to further promote Mexico's 
participation in the world economy while simultaneously seeking 
a diversification of markets through a realistic strategy of 
intensifying trade with select countries and regions. 
  Cuauhtemoc Cardenas also devoted some time to answering 
questions of businessmen attending the meeting. There was a 
total of 13 questions, and Cardenas did not have enough time to 
answer all of them. 
  Asked about fiscal policy with regard to the states, 
Cardenas 
indicated that state and municipal governments should be given 
more fiscal resources to improve their capacity to finance their 
numerous programs. 
  He stressed that states currently contribute 15 percent of 
all revenues while municipalities contribute 5 percent. "We 
plan to recommend before a national fiscal convention, which 
would be called for this purpose, that the municipalities triple 
their contributions and the states double theirs, thereby 
reducing the federal allotment from 80 percent to 55 percent," 
he noted. 
  Cardenas was criticized for his support for the 
reinstatement 
within constitutional Article 27 of the inalienable nature of 
ejidos and communal lands as a means to protect the patrimony of 
millions of peasants. 
  Answering a question on greater participation by the private 
sector in significant areas, Cardenas reiterated: "The oil 
industry and the generation of electricity should remain under 
state control, which should make them more efficient and fight 
corruption." 
  A rancher from the area voiced his concern over the invasion 
of lands by local residents, and he asked Cardenas for his 
position on land seizures. Cardenas stated that applying the 
full weight of the law constitutes the only means of protecting 
small landowners while ending backwardness in the countryside. 
This statement won him a round of applause. 
  The last questions focused on his political history. 
Cardenas said he had tried to democratize the party from within 
but decided to resign from the political organization when he 
saw this was an impossible task. 
  When the event ended, Bernardo Ardavia, president of the 
Southeastern Business Investment and Development Council, was 
asked to comment on the PRD presidential candidate's program. 
He asserted that many points in the program seem to be a return 
to the past, "especially when he talks of reforming Article 27. 
We have already seen that the previous legal arrangement did 
not bring development or investment to the rural areas in the 
past 60 years." 
  Cardenas' position, according to Ardavia, "prompts concern 
because it seems inconsistent. There were points that he did 
not answer clearly. There were also interesting aspects, such 
as the mechanisms proposed to protect small landowners. Well, I 
believe his proposal is an array of grays, and each matter has 
to be taken separately."

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments monitored through 28 June. 
  According to figures released by the National Institute of 
Statistics, Geography, and Information Sciences, INEGI, the 
number of persons working in the country's assembly plants rose 
3.9 percent during the first quarter of this year compared to 
the same period last year. INEGI added that up to March of this 
year there were 2,085 assembly plants in the country, which 
represents an accumulated yearly increase of 1.7 percent 
compared to the same period last year. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in 
Spanish 2144 GMT 21 Jun 94) 
  Figures from the Finance and Public Secretariat indicate 
that 
during the first quarter of this year, Mexico's trade balance 
showed a deficit of $5.728 billion, which represents an increase 
of 22.5 percent with respect to the same period last year. 
During this same period, the country's exports rose 15.8 
percent, whereas its imports rose 17.4 percent. (Monterrey EL 
NORTE (Foreign Edition) in Spanish 21 Jun 94 p 22A) 
  Economic research conducted by the daily EL FINANCIERO, 
based 
on Bank of Mexico data, reveals that the country's international 
reserves reached a record level of 25.332 billion, or a 3.2 
percent increase with respect to the balance accumulated until 
December 1993. The modest increase can be attributed to foreign 
investments, which rose over 10.6 percent during the first 
quarter of the year. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 21 
Jun 94 p 3A) 
  Speaking at the closing of the 26th National Meeting of 
Fiscal Officials, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari announced 
that all state governments will receive an additional allocation 
of 1.2 billion new pesos, thanks to an increase in tax revenues. 
He added that the money will be spent on social projects. 
(Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0402 GMT 22 Jun 94) 
  On 22 June, the Banque Nationale de Paris and the National 
Bank of Public Works and Services, Corp., Banobras, signed a 
loan agreement for 36.5 million francs, almost $6.5 million, 
with the interest rate set at 7.1 percent. Banobras will use 
the loan to finance the construction of new subway lines in the 
city of Monterrey, capital of the State of Nuevo Leon. (Mexico 
City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0808 GMT 22 Jun 94) 
  A little over $8 billion entered the country from January to 
May through the stock market, the National Stock Exchange 
reported on 21 June. It added that 56.6 percent of that total 
was obtained by placing debt bonds abroad. (Mexico City LA 
JORNADA in Spanish 22 Jun 94 p 40) 
  The Finance and Public Credit Secretariat, SHCP, reported 
that the Senate has approved treaties to prevent double taxation 
and tax evasion with Ecuador and Italy. It also approved 
agreements with Belgium and Switzerland to provide greater 
security and stability to investors from those countries. The 
SHCP said that an agreement between Mexico and Germany was 
promulgated on 10 June to prevent double taxation. (Mexico City 
EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 24 Jun 94 p 8) 
  According to economic research by EL FINANCIERO, based on 
information from the Commerce and Industrial Development 
Secretariat and the DIARIO OFICIAL DE LA FEDERACION, the Law on 
Economic Competition is being sidelined by the predominance of 
foreign investment in priority areas for the country's 
development. It is seen that foreign capital is increasing its 
presence in the domestic market by forming strategic alliances. 
This will promote the emergence of oligopolies that will limit 
the free participation of Mexican enterprises. Key partnerships 
are appearing in the commercial area with Gigante-Fleming; 
Gigante-Carrefou; Liverpool-K-Mart; Comercial Mexicana-Price 
Club; Comercial Mexicana-Toys'r'Us; and Cifra-WalMart. The 
incursion of firms with foreign capital is not limited to a 
single sector of the economy. They also include the food, 
textile, and tourism sectors. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO 
(ANALISIS Supplement) in Spanish 24 Jun 94 p 3a) 
  In the first quarter of 1994, Mexican Petroleum, Pemex, 
netted a $44.5 million surplus in its petrochemical products' 
trade balance. Pemex Petrochemical sold a total of 421,700 tons 
of petrochemical products. In the same period, it bought a 
total of $18.3 million worth of petrochemical products abroad. 
(Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 24 Jun 94 p 16) 
  Foreign investment in the first two months of the year was 
143 percent higher than the amount registered in the same period 
in 1993. The National Processing Industry Association, 
Canacintra, indicated that 77.6 percent of that capital was 
directed toward the financial market. Foreign investment 
channeled to productive activity decreased 24.2 percent in the 
first two months of 1994 while in 1989, this activity received 
85.8 percent of the investments. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 
0118 GMT 25 Jun 94) 
  Foreign investment during the current administration 
surpassed the goals set by the government at the beginning of 
the term. Commerce Under Secretary Fernando Sanchez said the 
1988-94 goal was $25 billion but has reached more than $42 
billion. He said there is currently confidence in Mexico 
because there are signs that industry is on the right course, as 
indicated by manufacturing sector exports which have exhibited 
"great dynamism." (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0218 GMT 28 
Jun 94) 
  Pemex increased its production of petroleum products 3.9 
percent in the first four months of 1994, compared to the same 
period in 1993. It produced 1.6 million barrels a day for the 
domestic market. Of this amount, 498,400 barrels correspond to 
gasoline. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 0131 GMT 28 Jun 94)

  [Text] San Jose, 28 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- The Costa Rican 
police today reported that a Colombian citizen, a top money 
laundering suspect sought by U.S. authorities, was arrested in 
Costa Rica as he arrived from Colombia. 
  The Judicial Investigations Agency (OIJ) reported that Juan 
Crisostomo Trujillo Martinez was arrested on 24 June after he 
arrived in Costa Rica aboard a flight from Santa Fe de Bogota. 
Trujillo's arrest took place after U.S. Customs alerted the OIJ 
to the pending arrival of the Colombian, whom the United States 
has linked to the "laundering" of large amounts of Cali Cartel 
money. 
  According to sources, Trujillo did not have contacts in 
Costa 
Rica. Rather, he arrived here after U.S. authorities set him up 
to travel to this Central American nation. The suspect, who 
remains in custody at a jail in San Jose, will be extradited to 
the United States within the next few days.

  [Text] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio yesterday 
acknowledged that there are Guatemalan settlers residing in 
Belizean territory; however, he explained that no pressure has 
ever been exerted on the peasants by Belize to get them to leave 
the area. Land is being sought to transfer them into those 
protected areas, he added. [sentence as published] 
  De Leon Carpio explained that his government's plan is to 
have the families living in the Chiquibul region leave the area, 
because it is a nature reserve. He added that studies are being 
conducted with the authorities of the National Institute of 
Agrarian Reform (INTA) to transfer these people to an area that 
meets their basic living requirements. 
  Nevertheless, he reiterated that Belizean troops are not 
driving these people out, as had previously been reported. He 
also said there is no final deadline for the withdrawal of the 
settlers. 
  "The government is taking all necessary measures for those 
peasants to settle in lands that will enable them to raise their 
crops. It is necessary for them to withdraw from Chiquibul, 
because this is a national park. But certainly, it is not 
because Belize is pressuring them to leave," De Leon Carpio 
noted. 
  In light of the situation, Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Antonio 
Monzon assured that the Guatemalans will be transferred in 
September to the Dolores municipality in Peten, located several 
kilometers from where they are currently settled. He explained 
that the trip will be sponsored by INTA, the Peten Land 
Committee, and the National Fund for Peace. 
  This issue caused several reactions last week when Carlos 
Asturias, former governor of the northern department of Peten, 
disclosed that Belizean troops had set a 25 June deadline for 
the settlers to withdraw from the area. 
  Asturias recently said the report had been received by a 
parish priest in the region, explaining that a group of soldiers 
who patrol the border area "are threatening them constantly."

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Guatemalan economic developments monitored through 28 
June. 
  The Guatemalan Energy and Mines Ministry reported on 21 June 
that crude oil production increased 13.2 percent during the 
first two months of 1994. During that same period, imports of 
petroleum and petroleum by-products increased 51 percent. 
(Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0031 GMT 22 Jun 94) 
  Official sources confirmed on 22 June that the World Bank 
has 
granted Guatemala a loan for $7 million to be invested in a 
low-income housing project in El Mezquital. (Panama City ACAN in 
Spanish 1601 GMT 22 Jun 94) 
  Economy Minister Eduardo Gonzalez has announced that private 
sugar producers in Guatemala and Mexico are seeking a formula to 
permit the entry of Guatemalan sugar into the Mexican market. 
Mexico recently implemented restrictions on the import of sugar 
from Guatemala to protect Mexican producers. (Guatemala City 
PRENSA LIBRE in Spanish 22 Jun 94 p 79) 
  Bank of Guatemala President Willy Zapata said on 22 June 
that 
macroeconomic indicators for the past few days have been 
adequate, particularly the inflation rate. Inflation in March 
was 14.14 percent, 13.91 percent in April, and is currently 
12.36 percent. He added that should this trend continue, the 
goal established for 1994, which is 12 percent, will be 
achieved. (Guatemala City SIGLO VEINTIUNO in Spanish 23 Jun 94 p 
6)

  [Text] General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir, chief of the Armed 
Forces, admitted yesterday that U.S. Secretary of Defense 
William Perry hinted at the deployment of U.S. troops from 
Panama to support Honduras' drug interdiction efforts. The 
officer then immediately pointed out that it would not be the 
first time such deployments have been carried out. "I have 
nothing against the democratic spirit, but at the meeting only 
generalities concerning cooperation and support were discussed." 
  The U.S. Government plan envisions deploying U.S. Air Force 
units stationed in Panama to Honduras to support the country's 
efforts against drug trafficking. Honduran civilian authorities 
were informed of this on 25 June at the Enrique Soto Cano Base 
in Palmerola, Comayagua. 
  Discua Elvir avoided commenting on the conflict that took 
place between Defense Secretary Perry and Honduran Foreign 
Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar, arguing that "President Carlos 
Roberto Reina is the one who establishes guidelines, courses of 
action, and foreign policy for the Armed Forces." "They (the 
Americans) are trying to implement preventive measures and 
operate in areas where drug trafficking takes place, locating 
sea, air, and land routes," Discua reiterated in reference to 
the drug issue. He added that this would make it possible to 
exchange community projects, resolve the housing problem, and 
deal with individual security. Discua explained that the 
expense of handling aerial equipment for this operation would be 
paid by the United States. 
  Discua also spoke about the groups that are trying to divide 
the civilian population from the military. He said they are 
known because "we are a small country." He said, however, that 
the Armed Forces are trying to rediscover the path to 
convergence from which Honduras strayed because of imposed 
missions or because of a poor concept of national security. 
  Gen. Discua Elvir yesterday spoke extensively about various 
issues -- including changes within the military -- admitting 
that the eighth graduating class is taking over the leadership 
that the sixth class, of which he is a member, is about to leave. 
  Nevertheless, his demeanor and tone changed when he was 
asked 
about the alleged anonymous threats reported by the Committee of 
Relatives of Missing Detainees in Honduras (COFADEH), which has 
directly blamed him. "It bothers me. Yes, it bothers me to 
discuss that because I do not know who is carrying out such 
pranks or campaigns that prevent people from working," he said. 
Discua Elvir said that a certain person who wants to create 
confusion is behind this situation. "The Armed Forces are not 
involved in that. Please, I believe that will be enough! he 
concluded. [quotation marks as published]

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Honduran economic developments monitored through 28 
June. 
  Authorities of the Central Bank of Honduras, BCH, decided 
yesterday to hold daily dollar auctions beginning 23 June. Bank 
spokesman Juan Soto said the auction will operate much like a 
stock market. (San Pedro Sula EL TIEMPO in Spanish 22 June 94 p 
2) 
  An official source reported today the BCH sold $2.9 million 
during its first U.S. currency auction. The post-auction 
exchange rate was 8.67 lempiras per dollar. These auctions are 
among the measures recently adopted by Honduran banking 
authorities to stop the increasing devaluation of the local 
currency. Local bank figures indicate the lempira suffered a 
devaluation of at least 13 percent during the first five months 
of 1994. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1800 GMT 24 June 94)

  [Text] Managua, 28 Jun (AFP) -- Seven former Nicaraguan 
recontras (rearmed contras) entered the Colombian Embassy in 
this capital today to demand political asylum, Government 
Ministry sources reported. 
  Another group of 15 former recontras of the so-called 3-80 
Northern Front, an armed group which demobilized in April, 
occupied the offices of the OAS International Commission of 
Support and Verification (CIAV-OAS) in a simultaneous act this 
morning, demanding government compliance with the disarmament 
agreements, official sources confirmed. 
  Although the former rebels inside the Colombian Embassy have 
not publicized the reasons for demanding asylum, local sources 
believe both actions seek the same objective: to exert pressure 
demanding compliance with the agreements in which the government 
offered them protection, land, and the participation of a former 
guerrilla sector in the police, among other things.

  [Text] Managua, 28 Jun (AFP) -- Recontras (rearmed contras) 
are holding hostage Colombian Ambassador to Nicaragua Mario 
Camacho and the rest of the Colombian Embassy staff in Managua, 
a woman inside the mission has stated. 
  "Everything is fine, but nobody can leave," the woman told 
AFP in a telephone conversation. The woman identified herself 
as an embassy official, but she refused to reveal her identity, 
and she appeared to be nervous. 
  The embassy was occupied "peacefully" on Tuesday morning by 
a 
group of Nicaraguan recontras who were not armed, the woman 
said. She did not specify how many people are being held inside 
the diplomatic mission. 
  Nobody answers the telephone in the embassy, and there has 
not been any information on what is happening inside. 
  The Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry has not made a statement on 
the incident. Police sources had reported earlier that the 
recontras had entered the embassy to request political asylum 
and not to necessarily occupy the embassy. The police sources 
noted, however, that they were unaware of other demands by the 
recontras. 
  In a simultaneous action, another group of former contras 
occupied the offices of the International Commission of Support 
and Verification of the OAS, which is located in Managua.

  [Text] Managua, 27 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- A group of 23 former 
Nicaraguan "contras" today sparked a new crisis for the 
government of Violeta Chamorro, after a group led by a disabled 
former contra occupied the headquarters of the International 
Commission of Support and Verification of the OAS [CIAV-OAS] and 
another group sought asylum in the Colombian Embassy. 
  The 15 former Nicaraguan "contras" occupying the CIAV-OAS 
are 
led by Leonardo Zeledon, a paraplegic known by the alias of 
"Comandante Chispero," a spokesperson for the Government 
Ministry announced today. The CIAV-OAS headquarters, which was 
occupied by the former "contras," is near the Government 
Ministry building. The CIAV personnel, whose number was not 
disclosed, continue to be held there this afternoon. CIAV 
Coordinator Sergio Caramagna, who entered the building to speak 
to the occupiers, is inside the building. 
  For their part, another group of seven former "contras" 
peacefully entered the Colombian Embassy in this capital to 
request political asylum because they fear for their lives. The 
group that sought refuge in the Colombian Embassy is led by Luis 
Arguello Montiel, alias "002," the Government Ministry source 
stated. 
  Neither the group that occupied the CIAV headquarters nor 
the 
group that sought refuge in the Colombian Embassy have explained 
their demands or why they fear for their lives. "Comandante 
Chispero," at the insistence of newsmen, said that it will not 
be until tomorrow, Wednesday, that they will publicly state 
their demands to the Chamorro government. 
  Managua Archbishop Miguel Obando y Bravo told the media that 
if the conflicting sides accept he would be willing to serve as 
mediator to resolve the crisis. 
  At the beginning of June, a group of 23 disarmed former 
Sandinist soldiers occupied for several hours the Venezuelan 
Embassy in this capital, to demand from the Violeta Chamorro 
government an indemnity payment for years of service to the 
Government Ministry. Practically simultaneously, another group 
of retired Sandinist military on 7 June occupied the Managua 
Cathedral for the third time since the church was dedicated in 
September to reinforce their struggle for indemnity payments. 
  Both episodes of violence in Nicaragua concluded after Vilma 
Nunez, director of the Nicaraguan Human Rights Center and 
Monsignor Eddy Montenegro, Vicar general of the Managua 
Archdiocese, served as mediators. 
  Several weeks ago former Sandinist soldiers occupied the 
Italian Embassy in Managua and the OAS building, to draw the 
government's attention to their claims.

  [Text] Managua, 28 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- The Nicaraguan 
Government has appealed to six former Nicaraguan "contras" who 
today peacefully occupied the Colombian Embassy in Managua, 
urging them to leave the building and "make use of legal 
procedures to demand" their claims. 
  A group of former "contras" led by Luis Arguello, alias 
"002," entered the diplomatic mission at 0945 (1545 GMT) and 
immediately requested political asylum because they fear for 
their lives. 
  Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal, through a press 
release, said that in this country "there is no need for 
political asylum," adding that this incident displays a 
misguided position (on the part of the former "contras"). 
  Leal stressed: "During Violeta Chamorro's government, in our 
country there are no, nor will there ever be, politically 
persecuted individuals." In addition, the head of Nicaraguan 
diplomacy said the occupants of the Colombian Embassy "can 
perfectly well leave" the site and make use of all media and 
every legal means to present their demands. 
  It was reported today from Colombia that the Foreign 
Ministry 
of that South American nation is studying the political asylum 
request by the six former "contras" who are inside their embassy 
in Managua. 
  With regard to the occupation of the headquarters of the 
International Commission of Support and Verification of the OAS 
(CIAV-OAS) by 17 former "contras," who also claim they fear for 
their lives, the Chamorro government still has not made any 
official statements. 
  The Colombian Embassy and the CIAV-OAS headquarters are each 
guarded by two patrol cars and five police officers. 
  At the CIAV-OAS headquarters, located near the Government 
Ministry Building, an unspecified number of CIAV-OAS personnel 
continue to be detained by former Nicaraguan resistance members 
who in the 1980's combated the Sandinist regime. 
  According to a Government Ministry official, talks are 
continuing with leaders of the groups occupying the buildings to 
find a negotiated solution to this new problem in Nicaragua. 
  In recent months, former "contras" and former Sandinist 
soldiers have engaged in a number of occupations and protests to 
demand the government's compliance with agreements on their 
reinsertion into civilian life. Venezuelan, Italian, and United 
Nations diplomatic facilities, as well as the Managua and Esteli 
cathedrals, have been occupied on previous occasions by these 
groups as part of their attempts to call the government's 
attention to their demands.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Nicaraguan economic developments monitored through 28 
June. 
  Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo on 21 June reported that 
the government, during a meeting with the World Bank 
Consultative Group in Paris, obtained a package of $750 million 
for programs that will be implemented in the next three years, 
and not just in 1994 as was initially reported. He added that 
Nicaragua requested another $180 million but the Consultative 
Group will discuss the request at upcoming meetings. (Managua 
BARRICADA in Spanish 22 Jun 94 p 5) 
  Central Bank President Jose Evenor Taboada announced on 27 
June that the World Bank the previous week granted a $60 million 
credit to support the economic recovery program. He confirmed 
that the IMF on 25 June approved a $173 million loan to help the 
country ease the effects of the structural adjustment program 
that the Chamorro administration has implemented since March 
1992. Taboada added that World Bank, IMF, and international 
community assistance will help the country to stabilize its 
economy. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 0052 GMT 28 Jun 94)

  [Text] The Presidency Information and Public Relations 
Office of the Republic has released a communique announcing that 
by executive decree signed by President Guillermo Endara 
Galimany, educator German Vergara has been appointed education 
minister. Professor Vergara has been appointed due to the 
retirement of current Education Minister Marcos Alarcon, 
effective 1 July. The communique adds Professor Vergara is the 
current Health Ministry secretary general. 
  The executive decree will become effective on 1 July. RPC 
tried to obtain reactions from Education Minister Alarcon as 
well as from Professor Vergara, but both declined to comment. 
The two men are members of the Arnulfist Party. 
  Meanwhile, teachers union leaders have expressed hope the 
new 
appointment will foster a better understanding between teachers 
and the Education Ministry. Efrain de Leon, of the Association 
of Independent Teachers, has commented on the issue: 
  [Begin de Leon recording] He represents the executive 
branch; 
therefore, he represents a political party and will function 
with political guidelines. We also know that working against 
him is his term of almost two months. We hope he will try 
during this period to correct the many mistakes Alarcon has made 
and reach an agreement, for the first time during this period of 
democracy, between the Education Ministry and the teachers 
unions. [end recording]

    [Editorial report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Panamanian economic developments monitored through 28 
June. 
  Delia Cardenas, planning and economic policy minister, said 
yesterday the Venezuelan Government has sent a letter to 
Panamanian authorities asking for the resumption of negotiations 
to pay Panama's oil debt with that country. Cardenas said that 
Panama has made several proposals to the Venezuelan Government 
to pay its debt, which is approximately $131 million, but that 
they have been rejected. (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in 
Spanish 22 June 94 p 1) 
  According to a report by the Comptroller General's Office, 
Panamanian exports increased by 34.17 percent during the first 
quarter of 1994 compared to the same period in 1993. Official 
statistics have also revealed bananas, with 38.51 percent, and 
shrimp with 8.51 percent, remain Panama's leading exports. 
(Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2058 GMT 23 June 94)

Commission for Atomic Energy [CNEA] chairman, has denied that 
the construction of a new nuclear power plant in Cordoba is 
being reconsidered and holds journalists responsible for 
disseminating inaccurate reports on this issue. 
  The CNEA chairman categorically stressed that "no decision 
has been made." He added that "a decision may be made by the 
end of the year, if it is made at all." 
  Mondino was very angry with journalists. He stressed that 
neither "the National Government, the CNEA, nor anyone else has 
ever discussed the construction of a second nuclear power plant." 
  Mondino described as "nonsense" reports released during 
President Carlos Menem's visit to Canada, where Menem addressed 
the issue.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 23 Jun (EFE) -- Chilean Foreign 
Ministry Under Secretary Jose Miguel Insulza stated on 23 June 
that Chile favors greater economic integration with Latin 
America, and particularly with the Common Market of the South 
(Mercosur). 
  During an interview with the TELAM news agency, the Chilean 
official also made it clear that Chile is not seeking to join 
NAFTA, an objective he considered "very difficult to achieve." 
  Insulza, who is making a two-day official visit to 
Argentina, 
drew a distinction between integration and free trade. 
  He stated that "integration is a much more complex concept; 
it entails trade, investments, strategic alliances between 
companies. We have assumed a commitment along these lines with 
our neighbors, and especially with Mercosur member countries." 
  "With the United States, by contrast, we are seeking to sign 
a trade agreement that will secure us markets in that country, 
but we are not interested in furthering an integration process 
with NAFTA or with North American countries because it would be 
very difficult for us from a geographic standpoint." 
  Insulza is participating in the quarterly follow-up meetings 
to the economic complementation agreements signed between 
Argentina and Chile in 1991. 
  "We want to sign a free trade agreement with the United 
States, but this is within the sphere of trade and investment," 
he noted. 
  The official said his country intends to sign free trade 
agreements "with countries in the farthest corners of the world, 
and not only the United States. If tomorrow the EC or Japan, 
one of our most important export markets, offer us an agreement, 
we will sign it enthusiastically." 
  Chile has recently proposed a limited integration with 
Mercosur [Common Market of the South] member countries 
(Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay), a regional project 
that will have its debut as a common market on 1 January 1995. 
  That scheme was defined as "four plus one" by Chilean 
Foreign 
Minister Carlos Figueroa Serrano. Chile is reluctant to join 
the initiative as a full member due to the different customs 
tariffs in effect. 
  Insulza said: "There are two aspects or obstacles that 
appear today to be insurmountable." 
  On the one hand we have "the tariff structure that is 
expected to enter into effect as of 1995, which is not 
compatible with Chile's tariff system. The other obstacle is 
related to a Mercosur principle to negotiate with others as a 
bloc, while Chile prefers to do its own business," Insulza 
concluded.

  [Text] La Paz, 22 Jun (LOS TIEMPOS) -- The metaphor about 
the "milk and the cow" was thoroughly explained today by 
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, when he said that even if 
Bolivia gets a sovereign sea outlet -- it wants to take concrete 
steps on the sea issue with Chile -- it must also get several 
outlets on both the Pacific and Atlantic, with the full use of 
the port of Ilo in Peru as well as the Paraguay-Parana waterway 
and other ports in Argentina and Uruguay. 
  "Even though the sea outlet claim is a valid issue, though 
problematic and difficult, we want to make progress in all 
fields -- cultural, political, and economic -- in all fields 
related to our great effort to have a sea outlet on the Pacific 
and outlets through the waterway," said President Sanchez at a 
news conference held today to talk about the positive aspects of 
his tour of the United States and Colombia. 
  The controversial statement made by President Sanchez de 
Lozada after meeting with Chilean President Eduardo Frei 
prompted a wave of protests for an allegedly antipatriotic 
policy on the sea outlet issue. 
  This policy was denied today by President Sanchez de Lozada, 
who said that the talk with President Frei was from any point of 
view very positive, because the sea outlet issue will be debated 
during the Rio Group summit next September. 
  "We want to see concrete things, concrete steps to improve 
the Bolivian situation," said Sanchez de Lozada, who pointed out 
the work being carried out by Peruvian President Alberto 
Fujimori, whom, he said, was carrying out "concrete" work 
allowing greater binational contacts, one proof of which is the 
highway linking the port of Ilo with the Bolivian border. 
  The explanation given by President Sanchez de Lozada on the 
metaphor he used after meeting with President Frei was mainly 
related to the fact that Bolivia has to use other "outlets" to 
the Pacific and Atlantic, and these would be the port of Ilo in 
Peru and the Paraguay-Parana waterway, because Bolivia is 
entering a stage of economic and productive expansion for which 
it is necessary to seek ports for exports. 
  Sanchez de Lozada said: "Even if Bolivia gets a sovereign 
sea outlet -- and this is our great goal and struggle, which 
will not change in this government or in any other -- we must 
also find other ports that will not be Bolivian, but Chilean, 
Peruvian, and on the waterway of the River Plate Basin. In its 
projection abroad Bolivia must show that by negotiating with our 
neighbors we can get benefits without having direct ownership of 
those ports and their installations." 
  In this regard, President Sanchez de Lozada said there is a 
feeling of solidarity in the neighboring countries (Peru, 
Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay) which makes him believe that 
Chile will also enter a new stage of relations for mutual 
benefit. 
  Therefore, said Sanchez de Lozada, it is hoped that for the 
September meeting the Bolivian and Chilean Foreign Ministries 
will prepare a work agenda that will consider the issues 
dividing the two countries under a new spirit of friendly 
relations.

<F P=106> [Interview with General Augusto Pinochet, commander in chief </F>
of the Chilean Army, by Maria Eugenia Oyarzun in his office in 
Santiago "24 hours" after returning from the Czech Republic] 
  [Excerpts] [Oyarzun] How was your tour? 
  [Pinochet] Fine! 
  [Oyarzun] Was it an official tour? 
  [Pinochet] It was a private tour of a professional and 
technical nature. I was invited by the Czech arms company 
Omnipol. 
  [Oyarzun] Did you travel on a diplomatic passport? 
  [Pinochet] Yes. I was surprised to hear someone say I was 
traveling on a false passport. How could I have done that if I 
was carrying a diplomatic passport, and everyone knows me 
wherever I go; some for better, others for worse? 
  [Oyarzun] It has been reported that you were harassed in 
some 
cities by people who were against your visit. Is this true? 
  [Pinochet] No, Maria Eugenia! No one confronted me anywhere. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Oyarzun] There were reports of demonstrations in Amsterdam. 
Is this true? 
  [Pinochet] I did not see anyone. Later, one general told me 
that five people -- just five -- were waving placards. Yet, the 
networks of socialist and communist reporters around the world 
disseminated some fabricated, magnified, or distorted reports. 
  [Oyarzun] Were those five people shouting at you? 
  [Pinochet] I was told that they were shouting, but no one 
paid any attention to them. 
  [Oyarzun] I know you like history. What was your impression 
of the new Czech Republic at this new stage without Marxism? 
  [Pinochet] One cannot say they are all democratic; there are 
still some communists there. 
  [Oyarzun] Are there many? 
  [Pinochet] One cannot say how many, but I believe not 
everyone supports democracy there. You must remember that the 
process in the Czech Republic is still at an early stage because 
the Czech and Slovak states were only created in 1990 following 
different processes of change. Only since the "Velvet 
Revolution" have they started to move toward democracy. The 
cultural factor greatly influenced this process because the 
Czech people, especially the ruling class, are highly educated 
and well informed. 
  [Oyarzun] Tell me, what did you see there? 
  [Pinochet] I will explain. I talked with people who informed 
me that before they had fixed salaries, homes, food, education, 
and health care, while now they have to work hard to get all 
this. 
  [Oyarzun] What did it mean to you who fought the communist 
system to arrive in a country that was behind the Iron Curtain? 
  [Pinochet] It confirmed that I was right when I rejected the 
communist system in Chile. [Communist Party Leader] Luis 
Corvalan is wrong in his book when he says the leaders and the 
corrupt are to blame, because the communist system is good. It 
has been proven that it is not the best system and that is why 
the situation is dramatic in socialist countries. 
  [Oyarzun] What do you think about the military factories you 
visited in the Czech Republic? 
  [Pinochet] I visited factories that manufacture war 
materiel. 
It was very interesting. 
  [Oyarzun] Is it better or worse than ours? 
  [Pinochet] I was not there to purchase anything. These short 
visits do not allow time for comparisons. Now is the time to 
make assessments and to analyze. 
  [Oyarzun] Did you visit a firing range? 
  [Pinochet] Not in the Czech Republic, but in Switzerland. I 
saw armored materiel and considered its main characteristics. I 
saw that new technology has been incorporated. In principle, 
however, I do not believe it will be of any use to us because we 
must consider the economic as well as the strategic, geographic, 
and technological aspects before making any decisions. 
  I visited Austerlitz, on the outskirts of Prague; the 
battlefield is there. It was very interesting. One has in mind 
the battles that took place there but it is different when one 
observes the exact location. A view of the terrain changes the 
images in ones mind. I will study these battles once again. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Oyarzun] People said you went to purchase guns. Did you? 
  [Pinochet] What ever makes you think that! I did not 
purchase a single rifle or bullet. Purchasing guns is no easy 
process. It is not like buying a shirt or a hat. I have to 
discuss the issue with the different experts on materiel, 
technology, and new systems to see if they are compatible with 
our existing systems. We must thoroughly assess the situation 
before making any decision. 
  [Oyarzun] Are we behind in technology? 
  [Pinochet] Yes. Regarding ammunition, for example, they use 
metal alloy cartridges which are much better than the ones we 
use. 
  We also visited the factory that manufactures the 30-ton 
Tatra trucks that are used to transport materiel, personnel, and 
supplies. Maybe we will buy a couple to try out. Nothing can be 
bought without testing. [passage omitted] 
  [Oyarzun] Do you think your visits to weapons factories in 
the Czech Republic, Switzerland, and in England may awaken 
suspicion as some Argentine politicians have stated? 
  [Pinochet] But I did not purchase anything! Does this mean 
every time a delegation travels to inspect new aircraft engines 
it will awaken suspicions? 
  [Oyarzun] In other words, your trip should awaken no 
suspicion among Argentines? 
  [Pinochet] There are no reason for suspicion, I did not 
purchase anything, I only assessed and evaluated. 
  [Oyarzun] Did you meet Czech or Russian military officers? 
  [Pinochet] No. My meeting were at an industrial level, with 
representatives of trucks, ammunition, and pistol factories. As 
you known, local enterprises sometimes act as sales agents. For 
example, Famae [Army Ordnance] could act as the sales agent for 
the C2 pistol for the entire hemisphere. 
  [Oyarzun] Are the weapons you saw similar to the ones 
smuggled into Chile through Carrizal Bajo? 
  [Pinochet] No. The weapons found in Carrizal Bajo were 
U.S.-made weapons with the serial numbers erased. 
  [Oyarzun] What do you think about the return to Chile of 
terrorist Sergio Buschmann, one of the terrorists who smuggled 
the weapons into Chile? 
  [Pinochet] Mr. Buschmann has a pending case with the court, 
that is all. He will undoubtedly try to act well but the truth 
is that he is a very poor actor. 
  [Oyarzun] Is he good enough for a secondary role? 
  [Pinochet] Not even for a third rate role... 
  [Oyarzun] Do you consider your treatment in Europe correct 
in 
your capacity as commander in chief of the Army? 
  [Pinochet] The treatment I received everywhere was 
excellent. 
I was treated very well. It was an incident-free working visit. 
  [Oyarzun] Did you meet politicians or military officers? 
  [Pinochet] I did not meet with just anyone who wanted to 
talk 
to me, less still did I agree to be interviewed by the media. 
  [Oyarzun] Why not? 
  [Pinochet] Because they publish things that are not true. I 
did not grant any foreign sector of the media an interview. 
  [Oyarzun] Why did you not go to Russia? 
  [Pinochet] I never considered going to Russia, although I 
have an invitation to do so. I was unable to extend my trip to 
include Russia because I was running short of time. You must 
remember that these trips are very tiring because one goes to 
work and not to have fun. This folder contains the preliminary 
report of my visit. 
  [Oyarzun] Have you given it to the defense minister? 
  [Pinochet] Yes, of course. 
  [Oyarzun] Would you say the trip was positive? 
  [Pinochet] The trip was very positive. 
  [Oyarzun] Did you see the British missile launchers? 
  [Pinochet] Yes. I wanted to see if it could be used to 
transport our Lightning rocket. 
  [Oyarzun] Has it been decided that Famae and a British 
enterprise will jointly build the Lightning rocket? 
  [Pinochet] No agreement has been reached yet. 
  [Oyarzun] Why not? 
  [Pinochet] We are talking, discussing the details... 
  [Oyarzun] What materiel do they produce in Switzerland? 
  [Pinochet] Contrary to what most people imagine, Switzerland 
has very important war materiel factories. They manufacture 
anti-aircraft machine guns, anti-aircraft cannons, radar, and 
small weapons of very good quality. [passage omitted] 
  [Oyarzun] Deputy Seguel has said that he would reduce rather 
than increase Carabineros' salaries. Can the salaries of the 
Armed Forces and Carabineros be reduced at all? 
  [Pinochet] Officers and military personnel do wonders to 
survive! I try to improve their situation with social benefits, 
with provisions, but their salaries are extremely tight and are 
really not enough. 
  [Oyarzun] How much does a newly enrolled corporal earn. 
  [Pinochet] Some 80,000 pesos per month, but from this amount 
they have deductions. 
  [Oyarzun] Is the situation the same for the Carabineros? 
  [Pinochet] It is the same system. All Armed Forces personnel 
are on the same salary scale, they all have the same guarantees. 
In other words, the situation is very difficult. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Oyarzun] Are you and Defense Minister Edmundo Perez still 
on 
"honeymoon"? 
  [Pinochet] I have a good relationship with Minister Perez. I 
was a friend of his father and have great respect for the 
minister. I was commander of the Santiago Garrison when VOP 
[People's Organized Vanguard] extremists killed Mr. Perez 
Zujovic; I chased these men for five days until I found them at 
the Chile racetrack. Troops surrounded them, while members of 
the Investigative Police arrested them. We are not on 
"honeymoon." You know honeymoons end and the difficulties 
begin. I have a good relationship with the defense minister and 
believe we will continue to do so. 
  [Oyarzun] Is your relationship with War Under Secretary 
Jorge 
Burgos also good? 
  [Pinochet] Yes, I think he is very pleasant and efficient. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Oyarzun] How is the modernization of the Army going? I know 
you are determined to complete it. 
  [Pinochet] My trip was related to that process. I think we 
made progress. You will hear what I have to say about it during 
my conference on the subject in August. 
  [Oyarzun] Are you bothered about all the attacks and 
criticisms on you? 
  [Pinochet] It is like a disease. If it appears on the hand, 
for example, the body generates antibodies to get rid of it. I 
am immune to these attacks. Some people like to talk, and as it 
sells newspapers, they take advantage of it. [passage omitted]

  [Text] A new narcocassette was just disclosed, and those 
who sent it assured have us that it contains new evidence on the 
involvement of drug funds in the political campaigns. Here is a 
report by J.J. Pinilla: 
  [Begin Pinilla recording] Attention. A communique and a 
cassette have just been dropped off at the "National Newscast" 
reception desk. In this cassette, a group called Honorable 
Colombians reveals two messages: The first message includes 
statements by journalist Alberto Giraldo and Gilberto Rodriguez 
Orejuela; it deals with a meeting between Giraldo and Santiago 
Medina, Samper's campaign treasurer. In this meeting Gilberto 
Rodriguez Orejuela confirms that the Cali Cartel funded Samper's 
campaign. The second message contains statements by Alberto 
Giraldo and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela. The topic revolves 
around the, quote, honorable, unquote, General Miguel Maza 
Marquez's receiving money from the Cali Cartel. 
  The communique was also sent to the Supreme Court of 
Justice, 
the Prosecutor General's Office, the Attorney General's Office, 
all the media, and the French and U.S. Embassies. The "National 
Newscast" has not yet disclosed the contents of the cassette 
because the voices of the people in it have not been identified.

  [Excerpt] Santa Fe de Bogota, 28 Jun (EFE) -- According to 
SEMANA magazine, Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, the paramount 
leader of the "Cali Cartel," telephoned a subdirector of EL 
TIEMPO daily to swear to him on lives of his children that he 
did not make any contributions to any of the presidential 
candidates. 
  The magazine assures that last Thursday [23 June] "amid the 
scandal caused by the alleged injection of hot money into the 
electoral contest," Rodrigo Orejuela called reporter Enrique 
Santos Castillo to explicitly tell him that his organization did 
not make any contributions to any of the candidates. 
  The scandal, which resulted from the disclosure of 
audiocassette recordings of conversations between reporter 
Alberto Giraldo and the brothers Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez 
Orejuela, has tainted Liberal candidate Ernesto Samper's 19 June 
election victory. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The tense climate engendered by alleged attempts by 
Cali Cartel drug trafficking sources to inject drug money into 
the presidential elections continues today with the appearance 
of more tapes anonymously sent to the media that include 
conversations between the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers and 
journalist Alberto Giraldo. 
  Nevertheless, skepticism is starting to develop in many 
camps 
in regard to the tapes, and there is speculation about the real 
intention behind the mailing of the tapes. 
  Another narcocassette appeared today and included recordings 
of two conversations and a communique pointing to alleged 
conversations between Cali Cartel members and journalist Alberto 
Giraldo. After being analyzed by the authorities, it was 
disclosed that one of the tapes is a copy of tapes made public 
last week. The content of the second tape is still being 
investigated. 
  According to authorities, the tapes, communique, threats, 
and 
rumors of terrorist attacks in the country are being 
disseminated by groups seeking to promote chaos in the country 
for unknown reasons. 
  This afternoon, the government, via the Government Ministry, 
reminded the media of the ban currently in effect barring the 
transmission of communiques or messages originating from 
guerrillas or terrorist groups. The minister stressed that it 
is also prohibited to disseminate through radio or television 
any interviews with members of criminal organizations.

  [Text] The wave of rumors, instead of ebbing, is swelling 
with each passing moment. Today it was learned that during 
statements made to French television, the director of a private 
organization headquartered in Paris and which specializes in 
investigating drug trafficking, linked Vice President-elect 
Humberto De la Calle to one of the drug cartels. The 
allegations prompted a strong reaction from Vice President-elect 
De la Calle. 
  Ever since the so-called narcotapes appeared, Colombia's 
image overseas continues to be tarnished. This time the reports 
came from France. (Alain Labreuse), director of the 
nongovernment organization Geopolitical Narcotics Observer 
alleged that Vice President-elect Humberto De la Calle has links 
to the Cali Cartel. 
  De la Calle, who just yesterday received a message from 
French President Francois Mitterrand reiterating his support for 
the new Colombian Government, vehemently denied the allegations: 
  [Begin De la Calle recording] I have no information about 
this gentleman. This is simply international gossip -- which is 
all we need. Now we are seeing all sorts of international 
garbage being thrown at Colombia. I strongly protest this sort 
of information. All of you know me very well. It is nothing 
more than a delusion to try to link Humberto De la Calle with 
the Cali Cartel. [end recording] 
  De la Calle labeled the campaign against the country as 
despicable, and he reiterated President-elect Ernesto Samper's 
determination to fight the drug cartels.

  [Text] President Juan Carlos Wasmosy met with National 
Encounter Alliance, AEN, leader Guillermo Caballero Vargas this 
morning in a move to obtain the support of his party in Congress 
for its privatization program--given the lack of endorsement 
from his own party. 
  Caballero Vargas underlined: "There is no marked difference 
between the three (economic) projects that were publicly 
expounded during the campaign leading to the 9 May elections. 
There may be slight differences, mainly in the procedures 
involved in the privatization scheme, but the three all agree on 
the need to privatize government-owned enterprises." 
  The meeting was held at the presidential residence at 0700 
local time and lasted approximately two hours. It was convened 
by President Wasmosy. 
  Milciades Rafael Casabianca, AEN bloc leader in the Senate, 
also attended this meeting. 
  Commenting on the purpose of this meeting, Caballero Vargas 
noted that "there are obvious disagreements" between the 
executive branch and the Colorado Party about privatization. 
  Asked if Wasmosy was trying to curry favor with the 
opposition as he lacks the support of the Colorado Party for his 
economic program, Caballero Vargas replied: "This is the 
impression we all have. If we have that impression, the 
president must certainly have it." 
  He continued: "I think the opposition has a more coherent 
stance on this issue. The president believes he will find more 
support on the opposition benches than on the Colorado Party 
benches." 
  Caballero Vargas added that differences will be reflected on 
very specific subjects, but "we must achieve consensus and 
compromise, especially regarding the preference the Constitution 
grants workers in privatizations." 
  He stated that direct dialogue like the one proposed by 
Wasmosy is the best way to analyze subjects like this, "since it 
seeks to iron out difficulties and prevent misunderstandings." 
  Wasmosy and Caballero Vargas also broached the subject of 
financing this year's harvest and the inflow of foreign exchange 
even though, according to the AEN leader, these were not the 
main points of their discussion. 
  Wasmosy convened this meeting to sound out the opposition on 
the implementation of his privatizations program and to obtain 
its support in Congress. 
  Caballero Vargas said the problem of how to finance farmers 
was mentioned "only in passing" during the meeting. He added 
that another subject raised was the noteworthy entry of foreign 
exchange. 
  He said: "Those of us who believe we know something about 
our 
country's economy are dumbfounded by this phenomenon," adding: 
"Paraguay's economic variables are under control. Yet, as I told 
the president, the miracle does not lie in the stabilization of 
macroeconomic variables, inflation, exchange rates, etc. The 
miracle lies in controlling inflation with an exchange rate 
policy that enables the country to be competitive and, above 
all, with interest rates that help to achieve development." 
  Caballero Vargas observed that there is economic stability 
in 
Paraguay, but "at this rate the whole productive apparatus will 
go bankrupt. 
  Much has been done, but the test of these achievements is to 
be found in interest rates, which must be considerably reduced." 
  Although it is not known if anything concrete resulted from 
this meeting, Wasmosy's objective in convening this meeting is 
to prop up his economic program with the help of the opposition 
since it lacks the support of the Colorado Party. 
  This is evinced in remarks by Vice President Angel Roberto 
Seifart and Colorado Party President Eugenio Sanabria Cantero, 
who voiced their reluctance to undertake the massive 
privatization of government-owned enterprises. 
  Opposition to the privatizations has a mainly political tone 
because the Colorado Party draws a considerable number of votes 
from government-owned enterprises.

  [Text] About 30 light planes were reportedly detected or 
intercepted during the time U.S. radar installations to help 
drug enforcement were operating, but clandestine drug flights 
allegedly total over 10,000 per year. 
  This was announced by Congressman Julio Castro Gomez (MDI) 
[Democratic Left Movement], who presides over the subcommittee 
that investigates this crime. 
  The U.S. radars were installed in Yurimaguas and Andoas 
about 
two years ago. 
  Castro Gomez said the military chief of the Upper Huallaga 
emergency zone had stated that 10,000 trafficking planes enter 
the country every year. 
  He added that the capture of trafficker Demetrio Chavez 
Penaherrera, aka "Vaticano," has not decreased the flow of drugs 
despite the belief that Chavez controlled the trafficking 
industry. 
  Castro Gomez said: "The quantity of cocaine base and cocaine 
hydrochloride leaving the country has not changed." 
  He announced the arrival of U.S. State Department officials 
who will meet with local officials and explain the suspension of 
the U.S. cooperation provided by the radar installations. 
  He recalled that this support ended on 1 May when the 
Yurimaguas and Andoas radar installations stopped sending 
information to the Peruvian Air Force on planes entering 
Peruvian airspace. 
  [EL COMERCIO] Have trafficking flights increased since the 
radar stopped operating? 
  [Castro Gomez] Obviously, the lack of a means to detect 
flights makes it easier for trafficking gangs to operate, taking 
drugs out and bringing weapons and dollars in. The U.S. State 
Department officials should have come here first before making 
the decision to ended the cooperation. I believe the time has 
come to evaluate that mechanism for drug enforcement in the 
country. 
  [EL COMERCIO] How many tonnes of drugs are transported? 
  [Castro Gomez] We believe between 1,500 and 2,000 tonnes 
leave the country every year. 
  [EL COMERCIO] How much does that represent in money? 
  [Castro Gomez] A very large amount. About $1.3 to $1.5 
billion enters the country for the sale of cocaine base and 
byproducts. 
  [EL COMERCIO] Does that enter our free exchange market? 
  [Castro Gomez] Yes. It enters the free exchange market where 
the Central Bank and the commercial banks also operate. We have 
a narco dollar-ridden economy which depletes the competitivity 
of our exports and keeps the dollar rate low. 
  Castro Gomez recognizes that the radar installations forced 
traffickers to change their behavior. 
  [EL COMERCIO] How did they change? 
  [Castro Gomez] They stopped flying during the day and began 
flying at night even though night flights are also detected by 
radar. Now the actions of our Air Force are restricted because 
it does not have the night flying equipment for its Tucano 
planes. 
  [EL COMERCIO] Has an investigation been carried out about 
the 
alleged support given to traffickers by some officials? 
  [Castro Gomez] Some Air Force personnel in charge of 
airports 
in the emergency zone provided support. They have been charged 
with trafficking. They allowed light planes to land and take off 
after receiving their "share" from the traffickers. 
  [EL COMERCIO] Are we facing an endless problem? 
  [Castro Gomez] It is a problem. Traffickers corrupt because 
of their large profits and huge recourses. Overall formulas to 
deal with it and defeat it must be sought.

  [Text] The suspension of U.S. radar services has increased 
the limitations of the antinarcotics fight in Peru, but the 
situation is not as severe as it may seem. 
  Everything indicates that the withdrawal of U.S. radars in 
Andoas and Iquitos in March 1992 was an important setback. 
  The U.S. radar in Yurimaguas, which was to be a key weapon 
in 
the antinarcotics air fight, never amounted to anything. Since 
its installation in February 1993 the radar had suffered several 
malfunctions, which put it out of operation on several occasions. 
  Under optimum conditions the radar should have been able to 
detect up to six targets at once in a 200-mile radius. This 
radar never functioned properly, however. 
  This radar is 32 years old. It dates back to 1962 and is of 
very inferior quality to the one the U.S. Government installed 
in Peru in 1991. The other two radars, installed in Andoas and 
Iquitos in November 1991, were withdrawn in March 1992. 
  During this period 12 small planes with drug shipments were 
seized, and dozens detected. 
  Originally it was thought that the same successful results 
that were obtained with the radars stationed in Andoas and 
Iquitos would be obtained with the Yurimaguas radar, but it was 
not so. The Peruvian Air Force [FAP] and the U.S. Embassy were 
also not unaware of the serious defects affecting the radar. 
  The Yurimaguas radar merely served for dissuasive purposes. 
To avoid the radar's range, drug traffickers were forced to use 
longer but safer flight routes. 
  At any rate, the U.S. Government has also dismantled the 
Yurimaguas radar. 
  According to an FAP study, however, four radars in good 
working condition are needed to effectively control the air 
space in the region. 
  The FAP, however, does not have sufficient means to conduct 
this type of air interdiction program. Commenting on the impact 
of the controversial U.S. Government decision, a high-ranking 
FAP officer, who was barely able to conceal his regret, states: 
"We were left virtually blind." 
  These limitations are not new, however. 
  In addition to the fact that the Yurimaguas radar was 50 
percent inoperative because it was relatively outdated, the FAP 
has experienced equipment restrictions. 
  Nevertheless, the FAP has used in full all the resources 
available to combat drug trafficking, in compliance with decree 
Law No. 25426. This decree entrusted the FAP with air 
surveillance of the jungle region, the neutralization of secret 
landing strips, and the control of air fields in coca producing 
areas. 
  To fulfill its detection and interdiction operations the FAP 
resorted to the use of combat planes used for training cadets. 
To this effect the FAP permanently allocated four Tucano T-27 
planes, while two Cessna A-37's were sporadically used for this 
purpose. 
  Other means the FAP uses are the Y-12 and T-41 light planes, 
which are also insufficient for carrying out this work. These 
planes are in charge of granting logistics support, but this 
should really be carried out by larger planes. 
  After more than three years in operation all of these planes 
have deteriorated and have lower performance than the planes 
used by drug traffickers. Unofficial sources state that a Tucano 
plane, for example, develops a speed of 200 knots and flies at 
26,000 feet, while a small plane develops a speed of 300 knots 
and flies at 30,000 feet. Moreover, the navigation and 
communication equipment is notably inferior to what is found in 
the planes the drug traffickers use. 
  An officer states: "At first the Tucanos were efficient, but 
now they have become obsolete." 
  In addition to the Tucano and Cessna planes, the FAP has 
resorted to the use of helicopters for interdiction operations 
in the jungle. 
  Only a couple of armed helicopters have been assigned to 
this 
task, however, because the majority of them are being employed 
in antisubversive operations. 
  In view of this, U.S.-manufactured Bell-214 helicopters are 
used to intercept and seize small planes. 
  In the beginning these helicopters did a good job, but they 
became ineffective when in turn drug traffickers increased their 
night flights. These helicopters lack adequate equipment for 
night operations. Instead, the planes used by drug traffickers 
are equipped with infrared systems, sophisticated communications 
equipment, and even radar detectors. 
  The FAP has been able to acquire six night vision 
units--each 
worth $25,000--but because of their high cost their use is 
restricted. 
  Like the Tucano planes, the helicopters have also 
deteriorated. In addition, there were never enough of them. FAP 
studies note that at least six helicopters are needed to 
effectively patrol the region. 
  Since 1991 the FAP has been able to intercept, seize, and 
capture about 200 small planes. This figure includes those 
planes seized or intercepted through the Andoas and Iquitos 
radars, and through the Yurimaguas radar which was recently 
withdrawn. 
  With obsolete planes, without radars, and without adequate 
technical assistance, the FAP continues to fight a better 
equipped enemy.

  [Text] Seoul -- The delegation of Peruvian legislators 
visiting Seoul in response to an invitation extended by the ROK 
National Assembly have expressed the need for strict adherence 
to nuclear nonproliferation treaties, which they said are the 
only guarantees for peaceful coexistence. 
  The delegation of Peruvian legislators comprising Oswaldo 
Sandoval Aguirre, Carlos Blanco Oropeza, and Antero Flores Araoz 
warned that the nuclear subject is an issue that concerns the 
entire world and not only the Korean peninsula. The Peruvian 
legislators also expressed their hope that mechanisms of 
understandings will be achieved to avoid any armed conflicts. 
  After meeting ROK Parliamentary speaker Yi Man-sop, the 
Peruvian legislators said: We hope the right of South Koreans to 
live in peace will be respected. "Our countries want peace not 
war because only thus we will be able to achieve our countries' 
development."

  [Text] Lima, 26 Jun (EFE) -- The general elections, 
presidential and legislative, will be held in Peru on 9 April 
1995, the second Sunday in April. This announcement was made 
today by the National Elections Board [JNE]. 
  JNE President Ricardo Nugent stated that the electoral law 
establishes that the elections will be held on the second Sunday 
of April. He added, however, that the executive branch must call 
for the elections. 
  Nugent also said that the JNE will look into the possibility 
of submitting a draft bill to modify the current law and to 
establish that electoral propaganda is allowed until the day of 
the elections, as well as to allow the disclosure of public 
opinion polls. 
  According to the law currently in force, electoral 
propaganda 
is only allowed until 48 hours before the day of the elections, 
and the results of polls can only be disclosed until 15 days 
before the elections. 
  In a statement to the media, Nugent said that "nobody is 
going to change his opinion whether he is told something the day 
of the elections or 48 hours before." 
  Nugent also said that on the day of the upcoming general 
elections, any political party or civic group will be able to 
carry out vote counts parallel to the official vote returns of 
the JNE.

  [Text] During the 81st International Labor Organization 
(ILO) Assembly, which is being held in Genoa, Italy, leaders of 
the General Confederation of Peruvian Workers (CGTP) yesterday 
raised several charges against the Peruvian Government, among 
which are the alleged curtailment of Peruvian workers' right to 
join unions and a lack of measures to protect those who are 
arbitrarily fired. 
  CGTP Secretary General Juan Luna Rojas was delegated to 
speak 
on behalf of the Peruvian unions' delegation before union and 
government representatives from the entire world. Luna Rojas 
reported that the government, businessmen, and the military have 
in Peru established a kind of "political triumvirate" that seeks 
to "make more flexible" labor legislation, "to the detriment of 
workers." 
  Luna Rojas said: "We are obliged to condemn the main 
guidelines of the antilabor policy currently being enforced by 
the Peruvian Government against Peruvian workers." 
  After charging that the Peruvian Government is violating the 
agreements signed with the ILO, Luna Rojas criticized Decree 
Laws 25593 and 25921; legislative Decree No. 728; Law 26279; and 
the enforcement of the Private Pension System and the Welfare 
Regulation Office [Oficina de Normalizacion Previsional] (ONP), 
which as of January 1995 will be in charge of paying retirement 
pensions. 
  Regarding Decree Law 25593, Luna said that it encompasses 
several measures that prevent workers from exercising their 
union rights, such as requiring a high number of people for 
establishing unions; the possibility of closing unions through 
administrative procedures; preventing trainees from joining 
unions; requiring a one-year seniority on the job in order to be 
a union leader; and forbidding unions from meddling in political 
affairs. 
  In addition, Luna said that for the first time in Peru, this 
decree law establishes that collective bargaining agreements 
expire after one year, which implies the elimination of all 
rights established through labor agreements. 
  He stated: "In so doing, workers are compelled to negotiate 
all benefits every year. Nevertheless, if workers choose to 
strike, this law empowers the government to issue a resolution 
cancelling the strike, ordering the workers to immediately 
return to their jobs, and ordering the Labor Ministry to respond 
to union demands." 
  Some of the regulations included in Decree Law No. 25921 and 
questioned by CGTP Secretary General Luna Rojas encompass 
employers' unrestricted power to change schedules, working 
hours, and working days; to suspend or replace workers' loans; 
to change working conditions; and finally to fire employees. 
  Luna Rojas said: "According to a regulation included in this 
decree law, if within 15 days the Labor Ministry does not issue 
a ruling on a request submitted by the employer, it is 
automatically approved." 
  According to CGTP sources, more labor violation charges will 
be raised in today's session, but this time they will center on 
violation of ILO agreements by Peru.

  [Text] Sao Paulo, 28 Jun (AE) -- This morning on Radio Nova 
Eldorado AM, Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero said that the 
minimum salary hike from $64 to $70 per month will not provoke a 
budget imbalance. Ricupero said Social Action Minister Sergio 
Cutolo participated in drafting the proposal and that the 
additional cost will not affect the Treasury. 
  Ricupero said the increase will be covered by rethinking 
some 
benefits, by eliminating the payment of irregular benefits, and 
by fighting fraud. He reaffirmed that the economic team will 
continue to balance public accounts because the stabilization 
plan is based on fiscal adjustment. 
  Ricupero advocates the use of regional minimum salaries. He 
said this will help solve the problem facing poor municipal 
districts that are unable to pay high minimum salaries. 
Ricupero thus answered a question about the effects on state 
and municipal governments of increasing the minimum salary to 
$70. He reiterated that the main stumbling block for increasing 
the minimum salary is the public sector because most private 
companies are already paying more than the established minimum. 
  Ricupero said the stabilization plan seeks to lay the 
groundwork for "reasonable" interest rates following the 
implementation of the real. He said, however, that if there is 
speculation on commodities and prices during the transition 
period, a "firm" control on the issuance of new currency will be 
used to provoke a shortage of cash. Ricupero added that interest 
rates would therefore rise and force those who speculate with 
their products to sell them to obtain cash. He added that care 
will be taken to ensure interest rates do not become excessive. 
Ricupero said the fear expressed by businessmen about high 
interest rates is unjustified. He sees a contradiction in their 
claims about high interest rates. In his opinion, some 
businessmen "would like to stockpile their products, but they 
will be unable to do this if interest rates are high." 
  Regarding the impact the recent frost will have on food 
prices, Ricupero said the government is prepared to use its 
buffer stocks, if necessary, to avoid excessive price increases.

<F P=106> [Article by Beatriz Abreu and Sandra Sato] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia, 27 Jun (AE) -- State-owned companies may 
not grant real salary increases (above the inflation rate) or 
salary advances during the "critical stage" of the 
implementation of the new economic program. They will also have 
to limit their investments to the revised ceiling of $7.6 
billion established in this year's budget. Finance Minister 
Rubens Ricupero and Planning Minister Beni Veras today 
officially conveyed this decision to the officials of major 
state-owned companies -- Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum 
Corporation], Eletrobras [Brazilian Electric Power Company, 
Inc.], Telebras [Brazilian Telecommunications, Inc.], and the 
Rio Doce Valley Company (CVRD). The two ministers have thus 
defined the scope of action of these companies to prevent them 
from jeopardizing the implementation of the real. Ricupero 
said: "While state-owned companies are usually regarded as the 
adversary, we would like them to have an active participation in 
implementing the new plan." 
  Ricupero and Veras installed the Interministerial Board, a 
body that will be charged with monitoring the expenditures of 
state-owned companies. The board, which will be of a temporary 
nature, will convene once a week to monitor spending by 
state-owned companies. Today Veras presided over the first 
meeting, at which he emphasized the need for state-owned 
companies to control their expenditures so as not to hurt the 
implementation of the economic plan. The most controversial 
topic was the government's reaffirmation that President Itamar 
Franco will veto any attempt at changing the investment ceiling 
established in the budget. 
  Raul Jungmann, executive secretary of the Planning Ministry, 
said: "If a state-owned company obtains a budget amendment to 
increase its investments, the government will veto it." None of 
the company officials uttered any complaint at the meeting. 
Telebras President Adyr Silva avoided a direct criticism of the 
government's restriction, but noted that he will have to spend 
$2.5 billion just to fulfill President Franco's request to 
expand private and public telephone lines. This amount alone 
almost absorbs the total of $2.9 billion allocated for Telebras 
this year. 
  The government is also concerned about negotiating with CVRD 
the need to control its budget spending and the salaries of its 
workers. The CVRD signed a management agreement with the 
government whereby it has autonomy over its administration. 
Speaking after the meeting, Jungmann said: "I am absolutely 
convinced that the CVRD, as well as the other state-owned 
companies, will comply with the revised budget allocations for 
1994." The Special Secretariat for State Enterprises [Sest] 
estimates that this year, CVRD will spend a maximum of $225 
million; Petrobras, $2.1 billion; Telebras, $2.9 billion; 
Eletrobras, $1.4 billion; ports, $187 million; Itaipu, $82 
million; and other companies, $213 million. 
  The installation of the board opens a new stage in the 
control of state-owned companies. A provisional measure 
reorganizing Sest and transforming the Committee for the Control 
of State Enterprises [CCE] into a council linked to Sest was 
published today in the DIARIO OFICIAL. The old CCE no longer 
exists, and Ledir de Paula Reis, former chief of the 
International Reserves Operations Department, has been appointed 
to head Sest. 
  As a result of the structural changes introduced to Sest and 
CCE, the government has gained more power to control state-owned 
companies. Jungmann notes that the former structure was based 
on presidential decrees, while the current structure is based on 
a law. Sest will now perform the role of the Department for 
Coordination of State Enterprises. The former CCE, which in the 
past was not linked to any organization, has now been placed 
under the basic structure of the Planning Secretariat. The CCE 
will consist of the finance and planning ministers, the Sest 
secretary, and the secretary for economic policy of the Finance 
Ministry. The two executive secretaries will no longer serve on 
the CCE.

<F P=106> [Interview with the brothers Jose Roberto and Luiz Carlos </F>
Mendonca de Barros, economic advisers to presidential candidate 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso, by Ismael Bermudez in Sao Paulo, 
Brazil; date not given] 
  [Text] [CLARIN] Does the Real Plan have real possibilities? 
  [Answer] Yes. The country's external situation is stable. 
We signed the Brady Plan. The trade surplus stands at around 
$11 billion a year. The national reserves are close to $40 
billion. The budget is also balanced... 
  [CLARIN] Are you not afraid of an overvalued currency with 
positive real interest rates and additional costs on production 
and consumers? 
  [Answer] The plan has two parts. The first stage ends at the 
end of the year. It attempts to assist the transition period 
until the new government takes over, independently of who wins 
the election. Unlike the Argentine plan, we are not committed 
to maintaining a fixed foreign exchange rate. Besides, in the 
past few years, productivity has grown 35 percent in Brazil. 
There is a lot of "cream" to compensate for any overvaluation 
of the real. 
  [CLARIN] What July inflation rate are you working with? 
  [Answer] Our July inflation rate should stand at around 3.5 
to 4 percent. 
  [CLARIN] Will you "burn" reserves to keep the foreign 
exchange at a fixed rate during the first months? 
  [Answer] Yes. And that is good because it will reduce the 
need to issue money. 
  [CLARIN] How will the plan fare if Lula [Luiz Inacio Lula da 
Silva] wins? Will we witness a drain of capital? 
  [Answer] If he does not win in the first round we will have 
a 
"runoff." Fernando Henrique Cardoso has a chance. In any case, 
both sides show -- not in campaign speeches but at the level of 
the teams and the two candidates -- that there is great concern 
about preventing splits to be able to allow a future coalition 
government. This, we insist, can be seen in both camps. 
Cardoso has already said he is not an anti-Lula candidate. He 
will not say that chaos will prevail if Lula wins. This 
improves Lula's chances because he is not presented as a threat 
["cuco"]. Cardoso's line is: "I have an economic plan to defeat 
inflation. Lula does not." 
  [CLARIN] Will Cardoso form a coalition government with the 
PT 
[Workers Party] if he wins? 
  [Answer] Yes. He will try to form a coalition, at least with 
sections of the PT. That is, with the center-right wing, which 
includes Lula. 
  [CLARIN] There has been a price explosion in the past few 
days. 
  [Answer] In July, with the real, we will have price 
stability 
and consumers will be able to know the true prices of products. 
  [CLARIN] Do you not think that the dollar price will 
increase 
due to foreign exchange demand and a positive real interest rate? 
  [Answer] The prices of staples might drop. 
  [CLARIN] Then why do supermarkets say they will mark prices 
up in July? 
  [Answer] Prices will continue to be free. We might have 
adjustments due to seasonal reasons. But look out, consumers 
will be watching, and with the real those who increase prices 
will not be selling. 
  [CLARIN] Is the real plan designed to increase the electoral 
possibilities of candidate Fernando Henrique Cardoso? 
  [Answer] No. The plan was delayed by Congress. The plan had 
to be implemented last year, but Congress delayed its approval. 
Now everything will depend on the next government. Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso decided to run this year because other 
center-left candidates dropped out of the race. 
  [CLARIN] Cardoso made an alliance with the right and is 
proposing a conservative-liberal policy. Can he really be 
considered a center-left candidate? 
  [Answer] Yes. He is a center-left candidate, like Felipe 
Gonzalez. Of course, of the modern center-right. If Cardoso 
wins, there will be a program to reform the social security 
system and the tax system. Tax collection responsibilities will 
be transferred to states and municipalities. 
  [CLARIN] Do you not think that many entrepreneurs are 
supporting Lula? 
  [Answer] Yes, those who are afraid of an economic opening. 
But Cardoso will not implement an indiscriminate opening 
policy. Jose Serra, the possible economy minister if Cardoso 
wins, supports the idea of an important state role promoting 
economic development. He does not believe that the market is a 
remedy for everything.

<F P=106> [Editorial from the "Notes and Information" page: "The Two </F>
Great Challenges"] 
  [Text] The fact that the U.S. Department of Commerce has 
included Brazil and Argentina among the 10 "large emerging 
markets" is an indication of the importance the Bill Clinton 
administration gives South America. This selection is due, to a 
good extent, to the potentials of the internal markets of 
countries participating in free trade areas, such as Brazil and 
Argentina. It is also due to the fact that these countries have 
a sufficiently developed infrastructure to permit the existence 
of powerful economies, but are not developed enough to take full 
advantage of all their market potential, that is, the potential 
of their population and territory. The recognition of Brazil's 
potential derives also, as was recognized by Commerce Secretary 
Ronald Brown during a recent interview (he visited Rio de 
Janeiro and Sao Paulo, and is today in Brasilia), from the fact 
that South America is in condition to become, within a short 
time, a more attractive market for the United States than 
Europe, particularly as it is open in terms of competition. 
  The U.S. Government's selection of Brazil and Argentina is 
not the kind of decision that is written on a piece of paper and 
delivered to whomever might be interested. If there had been a 
time for that kind of U.S. Latin American policy, it has now 
become obsolete. U.S. internal problems, particularly the 
creation of jobs -- as was stressed by Brown during his 
interview in Rio de Janeiro yesterday -- have become part of the 
U.S. foreign policy agenda (no matter how commercial they may 
be). In order to solve this problem, the Clinton administration 
has not hesitated to play all the trumps at hand, even at the 
risk of implementing an overly aggressive foreign policy. The 
Brown mission, carrying both private and public interests in the 
same bag, is visiting a country that has so far been 
characterized by the strong predominance of the public sector's 
bureaucratic mentality over business interests. For this 
reason, he risks getting involved in a conversation between deaf 
people, or of being coldly received, despite the zeal with which 
he champions his viewpoints. We should not forget, however, 
that these viewpoints are those of a great power. 
  The U.S. secretary of commerce is pursuing two important 
objectives in Brazil and Argentina. One objective is commercial 
and the other is political. The latter contains a great 
challenge for Brazilian authorities, both for the members of 
this administration, witnessing a sad end, and for those who 
will become the Brazilian authorities in the upcoming 
administration. The challenge implies an acceptance of the 
classification of "large emerging market," and acting in accord 
with the norms the United States want to apply to countries with 
less power than itself. It will mean sealing an economic 
alliance with deep internal social and economic consequences and 
speeding up the great transformation of our industries and 
services, a process that has been going on since our foreign 
trade began opening up. It also means agreeing on the need for 
deep constitutional reform, including not only the possibility 
of privatizing the communications and energy systems, but also 
withdrawing the privileges granted to Brazilian companies formed 
with national capital (an extended definition to cover all state 
companies) in contracts involving the public administration. 
But that is not all. It also means giving foreign companies 
without subsidiaries in Brazil the possibility of participating 
in public biddings and competing with Brazilian public 
companies. 
  The first objective, the commercial objective, also has 
political aspects. One example is the U.S. effort to win the 
bidding for the Sivan [Amazon Region Surveillance System] system 
to monitor the Amazon region, with advanced technology and 
possibly not using exclusively national software. 
  The previous positions taken by Brown, in defending the 
participation by foreign companies without branches in Brazil in 
the biddings involving Telebras [Brazilian Telecommunications, 
Inc.], give us a pale indication of the emphasis of his mission, 
which concludes today after official meetings in Brasilia. 
  In the Federal District, Brown will without a doubt discuss 
the most delicate issue affecting Brazilian and U.S. diplomatic 
relations: the patents law, the terms of which do not satisfy 
the U.S. Government. It cannot be established with certainty 
when the Senate will finish analyzing the bill, which will have 
to return to the Chamber of Deputies for further examination 
after the Senate votes on it. This slow pace, which is, 
nevertheless, a procedure established in the Constitution, will 
be slowed down even more by the deadline (which will undoubtedly 
be delayed as well) for ratification of the GATT agreement, 
which in some aspects conditions parts of the patents law. The 
delay in the Brazilian Congress is sometimes annoying, but it is 
a routine the that U.S. Government must understand, even with 
Super 301 in hand to punish what it calls unfair trade 
practices. In the end, the resistance the Clinton administration 
is beginning to find in ratifying the GATT agreement show that 
legislative powers still have weight in democratic regimes.

  [Text] Sao Paulo -- There is an urgent need for revising 
Brazil's model of scientific and technological development, to 
gear it to the new world political and economic order. Achieving 
this requires a reversal of the previous trend implemented 
during the past 25 years, which encouraged major technological 
projects of large dimensions that were highly sophisticated and 
centralized. There must be a move toward promoting initiatives 
that will bring a high rate of technological return to the 
productive system, and an international projection of Brazil's 
scientific and technical capacity. This is one of the main 
conclusions from a study prepared by the Getulio Vargas 
Foundation (FGV) at the request of the Ministry of Science and 
Technology and the World Bank (IDB), based on the agreement that 
established the Second Program in Support of Scientific and 
Technological Development (II-PADCT). 
  The work to assess Brazilian scientific policy, divided into 
three phases, was done by an independent group of Brazilian 
scientists and economists from Campinas State University 
(UNICAMP), which was responsible for covering relations with the 
economic sector; from the Getulio Vargas Foundation, 
concentrating on the current status of Brazil's scientific 
policy and the preparation of new guidelines; and from the 
Ministry of Science and Technology, studying the institutional 
aspects of the issue. 
  The results of the studies will be presented next week, at 
the "International Seminar for Evaluation of and Proposals for 
Brazil's Scientific and Technological Development," to be held 
at the FGV. Also to be discussed are the results of the 
applications of the funds released by the Inter-American Bank of 
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), totaling $72 million 
between 1985 and 1990, and by the IDB, amounting to $150 million 
during the past four years. 
  According to the coordinator of the work carried out by the 
FGV, Simon Schwartzman, a clear identification of the 
technological demands of Brazil's industrial plant is required, 
as is the aiming of research toward potentially applied fields. 
He explains: "Nevertheless, this does not imply a neglect of 
basic research, but rather its adapation to the country's model 
of economic and industrial development. In his assessment, 
Schwartzman remarks: "The 1980's were typified by a major lack 
of definition of the objectives and goals of Brazilian 
scientific production." This was due to the failure of the 
military plan during the Geisel government's term, with 
accelerated growth of the economy. At that time, an S&amp;T 
system 
was set up in the country aimed at large-scale programs intended 
to respond to the demands of the military sector, in the 
telecommunications, nuclear, aeronautical, and computer science 
fields. 
<H5>  Potential </H5>
  The abundance of funds and incentives was, however, not 
reflected in a concern for quality and efficiency in scientific 
production, which ultimately failed to gain an international 
projection. During the 1970's, Brazil was responsible for 0.2 
percent of worldwide scientific production. Ten years later, 
that production amounted to only 0.4 percent. "There was little 
growth," in Schwartzman's view. 
  According to data from the Ministry of Science and 
Technology, the scientific community consists of 50,000 persons, 
12,000 of whom have post-graduate degrees. "This number isn't 
small, and is comparable to that of a small European country. To 
take advantage of this potential, there must be a recovery of 
installed capacity and a redirection of Brazil's scientific and 
technological model."

<F P=106> [Article by Ricardo Bonalume Neto and Marcelo Leite] </F>
  [Text] While the Ministry of Science and Technology is 
attempting to "repair" research in the country, scientists at a 
seminar in Sao Paulo were debating the future of the nation's 
scientific development (without reaching unanimous conclusions). 
  Science and Technology Minister Israel Vargas announced that 
the new budget proposal in Congress has raised the funds for his 
ministry by 6 percent. He considers this increase good, when 
compared with the 16 to 20 percent cuts in other areas. 
  Brazil has again received sizable funds from the World Bank 
for the PADCT (Program in Support of Scientific and 
Technological Development). 
  Those funds come from both the Brazilian Government and the 
World Bank; but in October 1992, because of the lack of local 
matching funds, the country received only 3.8 percent of the 
PADCT appropriation. 
  "The faucet was turned off during the Collor government," 
remarks Vargas. Now, the percentage has returned to a more 
appropriate level, on the order of 70 percent, he claims. 
  The government is also negotiating a loan that could amount 
to $300 million or even $400 million. Some of the funds from the 
privatizations will go to science as well. 
  At the opening of the "International Seminar on Evaluation 
of 
and Proposals for Brazilian Scientific and Technological 
Development," at the Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV), the 
minister pointed out that private business firms contribute only 
15 percent of the costs of research and development in the 
country. 
  As early as this year, Vargas expects to raise the spending 
on science and technology by over $700 million annually. 
Brazil's total spending on the sector stands at approximately $3 
billion per year. The ministry's budget amounts to $800-$900 
million. 
  The background for the minister's statements consists of 
three studies on the status of science in the country, the 
purpose of which was to discuss proposals for the sector's 
development. 
  Another point stressed by the minister was the improvement 
in 
relations with the U.S. Owing to the conflict over the patent 
law, the computer science policy, and the construction of the 
Brazilian rocket, which the rich countries fear may become a 
military missile, the U.S. threatened drastic cuts in the 
scientific cooperation with Brazil. The conflict has been 
resolved. 
  Political scientist Simon Schwartzman, of the USP 
[University 
of Sao Paulo] and FGV, proposes the "associated laboratories" 
model, to provide a solid foundation for financing the leading 
research groups operating at present. 
  Schwartzman points to the CNPq's (National Research Council) 
estimate that Brazil has nearly 52,000 researchers, but that 
only a quarter of them (between 12,000 and 13,000) have 
doctorates, and hence are qualified researchers. Another quarter 
of that total have only taken a course leading to a degree. 
<H5>  Military Research </H5>
  Geraldo Lesbat Cavagnari Filho, a professor at Unicamp 
[Campinas State University] and colonel in the reserves, 
advocated the next federal government's continuation of the 
three main military research and development projects. 
  The three major projects that he cited are the parallel 
nuclear program handled by the Navy, the goal of which is the 
construction of a nuclear submarine in the country; the 
Brazilian Complete Space Mission, including the installation of 
a satellite launching rocket by the Air Force; and the 
production of the AMX fighter-bomber by Embraer [Brazilian 
Aeronautics Company]. 
  According to Cavagnari, all three projects were "mistakes," 
because the country could have found other means for achieving 
technological development. However, he thinks that it would be 
worse to end them now, when they are beginning to bring results. 
  According to the Unicamp professor, the dimensions of the 
military projects can be gauged by the total cost of the nuclear 
submarine project: $2.5 billion in 20 years. The launching of 
the submarine is planned for the year 2005. 
  Another fact demonstrating the sector's importance to the 
society: nearly 90 percent of the researchers employed by the 
military are civilians, the cost of whose training has been 
defrayed largely by the Armed Forces. 
  Another Unicamp researcher, Renato Dagnino, questions the 
supposed financial benefits accrued from military research, 
estimating that it consumes 20 percent of the country's total 
research and development budget. 
  Dagnino notes that, in the U.S., military research carries 
an 
even greater weight (approximately 40 percent), but is more 
effective in terms of value of the product. Whereas, in the 
U.S., the military industry accounts for 4 percent of the GDP 
(gross domestic product), in Brazil, during 1987, that 
percentage was only 0.2 (a result 10 times worse in terms of 
value of the end product). 
<H5>  [Box, p 1-12] </H5>
<H5>  Physics in a Critical Situation </H5>
  The picture of physics research in Brazil drawn yesterday at 
the International Seminar is dismal, as was to be expected. The 
physicists think that, to revive it, there must be a break in 
its umbilical link with the university. 
  This viewpoint was upheld by Sergio Machado Rezende, aged 
53, 
a full professor at the UFPE (Federal University of Pernambuco). 
According to Rezende, 84 percent of Brazilians with doctorates 
in physics are in universities, and 2 percent are in private 
business firms. 
  In more industrialized countries, nearly a third are in 
industry. In the U.S., the proportion amounts to 50 percent. 
There are 1,350 holders of doctorates in physics in the 
country; and 33,000 in the U.S. 
  According to Rezende, the only solution is more investment 
in 
the sector. Whereas industrialized countries apply $50 per 
capita annually, here the amount declines to $0.79.

  [Text] Sao Paulo -- Yesterday, the Program in Support of 
Scientific and Technological Development (PADCT) of the Ministry 
of Science and Development announced the allocation of $85 
million to be used to finance new scientific and technical 
research with funds from the federal government ($43 million) 
and the World Bank (IBRD -- International Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development) ($42 million). Also announced 
were the bidding invitations issued to business firms and 
educational and research institutions interested in submitting 
proposals for the procurement of financing for research projects. 
  During this phase of the program, priority will be given to 
proposals submitted by a partnership between private business 
firms and research centers to develop projects. The program's 
executive secretary, Luis Antonio Barreto de Castro, explained: 
"This is the method being adopted by the PADCT to stimulate 
scientific and technical cooperation between the universities 
and the productive sector." 
  The financing is aimed at projects in the fields of 
instrumentation, biotechnology, maintenance, chemistry and 
chemical engineering, earth sciences and mineral technology, new 
materials, basic industrial technology, education for science, 
environmental sciences, and information in science and 
technology. The funds will be transmitted through the federal 
government's three financing agencies: Capes [Council for 
Advanced Professional Training] ($10.5 million); CNPq [National 
Research Council] ($25.3 million); and Finep [Funding Authority 
for Studies and Projects] ($48.5 million). Projects that foster 
an interconnection among the various areas will be prioritized 
as well. 
  With this measure, the PADCT is taking another step toward 
releasing the $300 million specified for the next two-year 
period, $13 million of which has already been contracted since 
the beginning of the year. 
<H5>  1,800 Projects Financed </H5>
  The program has existed since 1984, having already financed 
nearly 1,800 projects ($170 million) during its first phase of 
execution (1985-89). In the second phase, which will extend 
until 1995, 820 projects have been contracted, representing an 
investment of nearly $150 million. Castro claimed: "There are 
prospects for continuing the program but, to achieve this, the 
government must redirect the country's policy on science and 
technology." 
  In Castro's estimation, the first 10 years of the program 
were intended to create the bases for Brazil's scientific 
development, when the concern was inclined not so much toward 
applying technological innovations, but rather toward training 
human resources. At that time, the research "was pre-industrial 
and pre-competitive, and it was impossible to demand a return to 
the productive process." 
  He claims that, this year, however, "we shall implement a 
more aggressive policy insofar as research results are 
concerned, requiring the university and business sectors to 
become associated at the beginning of the contracting for the 
project." 
  In this way, it is expected to facilitate the transfer of 
technolgoy and to stimulate technological training in the 
national industries. However, not all the questions involving 
that partnership between the public and private sectors have 
been resolved. There are many doubts concerning the method for 
dividing the future research results. "We don't yet know how the 
division of royalties, of intellectual and industrial 
properties, and of patents, which are always involved in the 
development of a new product, process, or invention, will be 
made." 
  Brazil is not the only country taking its first steps in the 
area of transfer of technology between universities and the 
productive sector. Castro maintains: "That trend is worldwide." 
  He thinks that the first measure to be adopted to facilitate 
the execution of those contracts "will be the proliferation of 
foundations that have space within their organizational 
structure for commercial and financial contracts, and that will 
help in the negotiations with the market."

  [Text] Sao Jose dos Campos -- The Aerospace Technical 
Center's (CTA) Experimental Physics Division in Sao Jose dos 
Campos is constructing a large-sized electron linear accelerator 
to conduct experiments that may furnish data of interest in 
nuclear technology and in the development of techniques for 
industrial use of radiation. 
  The first stage of the project, in its final phase of 
completion, includes a small-sized accelerator capable of 
generating energy on the order of 30 mega-electron volts (Mev) 
of power. The director of the Institute of Advanced Studies 
(IEAv -- part of the CTA), Colonel Hugo Pereira Chavez, 
remarked: "That energy is sufficient to solve 80 percent of the 
problems relating to studies in the nuclear field." 
  He reported that the final configuration of the accelerator 
will have eight accelerator structures 2 meters long, fed by 
four Klystron (high-powered) valves, and energy totaling 130 
Mev. The accelerator is being installed in the underground 
gallery of a building designed to meet all the radiological 
safety operational requirements. 
  The first part of the project occupies a two-story building 
inside the IEAv area, where 15 nuclear physics specialists and 
technicians are working. According to director Pereira Chaves, 
the project absorbed $5 million in investments within an 
eight-year period. The resources were financed by the Parallel 
Nuclear Program associated with the Federal Government's 
Strategic Affairs Secretariat. 
<H5>  Laboratories </H5>
  The IEAv director thinks that, with slightly over $5 
million, 
it will be possible to complete the construction of the 
accelerator in eight modules. This step is considered essential 
to the development of an autonomous national nuclear program. 
The IEAv's accelerator project involves the construction of 
microwave, electronics, electron beam transport and focusing, 
vacuum, and chemical laboratories. 
  The accelerator will also consist of an electron gun (source 
emitting electrons). The IEAv has already built and tested two 
versions of the gun. According to Colonel Pereira Chaves, the 
second version is now in operation, and is undergoing an 
optimization process. 
  The director claims that one important aspect of the 
electron 
gun was the pioneer development in Brazil of the metal-ceramic 
weld, a process with extensive technological applications 
already transmitted to other research institutions. 
  The IEAv also has developed the electron beam injection 
system, the accelerator structure, a microwave network, a 
Klystron modulator, a control system (allowing for mechanical 
operation of the accelerator), a vacuum system (with pressure of 
10-9 torr/pressure unit), and a cooling system. 
  Among the accelerator's main applications is the evaluation 
of the effects of irradiation of materials in the industrial 
field, with uses in radiochemistry, environmental pollution, and 
sterilization of surgical materials and food. Another 
application might be the development of experiments for 
radiological protection (shielding), to assess damage from 
irradiation of materials in the nuclear and aerospace fields. 
<H5>  Processes </H5>
  Through the accelerator, the IEAv has now succeeded in 
producing electron beams with energy of 30 Mev. "With that 
energy, it is possible to carry out experiments with the 
production of pulsated neutrons simulating nuclear reactors." 
According to the IEAv director, with the accelerator project it 
was possible to develop various techniques of interest in other 
fields, as well as to master special processes not yet available 
in Brazil. 
  Prominent among the processes are those for metal-ceramic 
weld, electroforming (shaping of surfaces), construction of an 
electron gun, magnetic lenses (focusing of electromagnetic 
radiation), and microwave components.

  [Text]Farm Sector Problems 
  The failure of the Uruguay Round of the GATT to achieve more 
significant progress in the direction of an end to protectionism 
and agricultural subsidies was largely the result of the 
defensive position taken by the Europeans. 
  This was the opinion expressed by the director general of 
foreign trade relations of the European Union Commission itself, 
Hugo Paemen, who was in Sao Paulo yesterday to attend the "New 
World Trade Map" seminar sponsored by this newspaper. "All of us 
share responsibility with respect to the situation in 
agriculture today," he said. 
  What then-President of the U.S. Ronald Reagan called the 
zero 
option, which called for an end to all subsidies by the year 
2000, proved to be an unrealistic goal and ultimately made 
things more difficult by creating a lot of antagonism, according 
to Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero, who also took part in the 
seminar. 
  Paemen believes, however, that negotiations will be easier 
from now on. "Now we have a clearer legal structure," he said. 
Furthermore, the diplomat emphasized the way the implementation 
of the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) had 
been accelerated throughout the Uruguay Round and how various 
countries that had been left on the sidelines of the 
international trade system had finally been integrated into it. 
  The goal of reducing farm sector subsidies, according to 
Paemen, will now be achieved naturally. More than 40 percent of 
the rural population of the European Union is over the age of 
60, which means that within a few more years these people will 
leave the labor market and start coming under the protection of 
the social security system. This means governments will be able 
to stop using production incentives to guarantee the income 
levels of that population group. 
  To Pedro de Camargo Neto, president of the Brazilian Rural 
Association (SRB), Brazilian farmers have little to be 
enthusiastic about. He says an illusion was created that great 
changes were about to occur, but it did not prove true. 
  Throughout the entire Uruguay Round, Brazil was the country 
most often targeted in complaints to the GATT about unfair trade 
practices. "When we tried to levy compensatory duties on imports 
of European milk powder we could not. They argued that we had 
not followed the right procedure," he said. Brazil failed in its 
attempt to prove that European milk was subsidized, and the 
issued ended up in arbitration. 
  According to the SRB president, the developed countries' 
policy of unloading stocks on the world market wrecks prices and 
hurts the poor countries. "Brazil's praiseworthy effort to try 
to develop an economic activity that other countries already 
have, such as dairy cattle, was ignored," he said. Camargo Neto 
believes "Europe's agricultural policies are so complex that it 
is possible to control surplus production and guarantee farm 
income without subsidizing exports." 
  Camargo Neto emphasized, however, that Brazilian 
agriculture's main problem is still right here within our 
boundaries. He says that traditionally, there has been an 
illusion that inflation could be ended by importing food and 
other raw materials. "So we killed off domestic production of 
wheat and cotton, and dealt livestock a serious setback." 
  In the case of cotton, for example, high volumes of imports 
have drastically reduced domestic production. In 1985, Brazil 
produced 970,000 tons of product, but this year the harvest is 
not expected to exceed 400,000 tons. 
  Brazil's lag in the textile sector -- besides the deficit in 
raw cotton production, insufficient investments rendered the 
industrial plant obsolete -- will entail significant losses. 
The country has only a 0.8 percent share of the world textiles 
market, a market that is likely to expand by 60 percent between 
now and the year 2005. During the same period, the expansion of 
the fabrics sector should be about 34 percent, according to 
figures cited by Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero. 
<H5>  Textile Trade Liberalization </H5>
  Textiles is one of the areas of world trade that is expected 
to show the most growth in the coming years, according to recent 
studies by the GATT. But that growth, which may be of particular 
benefit to developing countries -- Brazil among them -- will 
depend on progress in dismantling the Multifibers Agreement. 
  Multifibers is an agreement under which the developed 
countries set quotas that are filled by exporter countries, 
mostly developing countries. The first attempt to liberalize 
world trade in this area was made during the Uruguay Round of 
the GATT, which began in 1986 and ended last April, when 111 
countries signed the final act in Marrakech. 
  India's permanent representative to the GATT, Ambassador 
B.K. 
Zutshi, explained yesterday during a lecture at the "New World 
Trade Map" seminar that the Multifibers agreement is supposed to 
be dismantled over a 10-year period. The liberalization is 
divided into three phases. The first phase is supposed to begin 
on 1 January 1995, when the countries are supposed to free up 
imports equivalent to at least 16 percent, by volume, of their 
1990 imports. This means those products will start being 
governed by GATT rules. 
  In phase two, which is supposed to start on 1 January 1998, 
the minimum percentage of products to be liberated rises to 17 
percent in terms of 1990 volume. On 1 January 2002, this 
percentage goes up to 18 percent, and by 1 January 2005, all 
textile products must be integrated into GATT rules. 
  The implementation of this agreement, however, would follow 
that timetable [only] if the World Trade Organization, the 
entity that will replace the GATT, enters into force in January 
1995. 
  The impact on exports from producer countries will also 
probably be limited during the first five to six years, 
according to the Indian ambassador. He said the agreement does 
not require that, during this initial period, importer countries 
must liberate precisely those products that are now under quota. 
"I am assuming that the importer countries will not remove the 
products from the quotas until the end of the process, and so 
the impact on exports from producer countries will only occur in 
the long term," he stated. 
  Furthermore, Zutshi observed that textile manufacturers in 
the United States and the European Union are already mobilizing 
to try to delay the timetable for a more open market. Some 
organizations have even asked to have the start of the process 
postponed from January 1995 to July 1995. 
  The outlook in Brazil gives cause for concern, said Finance 
Minister Rubens Ricupero: "This is an area where Brazil lost 
competitiveness. It invested too little and did little 
renovation." 
  Brazilian businessmen are also worried. "Brazil is now more 
open than the United States and the European Union," said the 
financial vice president of Northern Minas Fabrics Company 
(Coteminas), Gomes da Silva, who also attended the seminar. He 
deplored the acceleration of the process of opening up the 
textile market that started in 1990, at the beginning of the 
Collor administration. "We had negotiated a gradual 
liberalization during the Sarney government, to give the 
industry time to get ready. Collor came along and accelerated 
the process. That is a reality now." 
  Gomes da Silva cited Brazil's advantages in terms of climate 
and energy. "Our production costs are low, despite high payroll 
levies." He believes that if the government reduces the tax load 
on the sector, Brazil may be able to increase its share of the 
world textile market. "In 1992, world textile trade amounted to 
$240 billion. That market was bigger than the automobile market. 
Brazil, however, accounted for only 0.8 percent of that market." 
<H5>  TRIPS Agreement </H5>
  The agreement on intellectual property (Trade-Related 
Intellectual Property Rights--TRIPS) approved during the Uruguay 
Round of the GATT will be useful to countries like India and 
Brazil, which have "a large reserve of scientific talent," 
Ambassador B.K. Zutshi, India's permanent representative to the 
GATT, said yesterday. These two countries, which most fervently 
opposed the inclusion of the new topic in the GATT realm, out of 
fear of future sanctions from the developed countries, 
especially the United States, now see opportunities under the 
new accord, even though Zutshi believes that "the integration of 
intellectual property rights into international economic 
legislation puts a heavy onus on the developing countries." 
  The principal novelties the TRIPS agreement introduces are: 

  -  Copyright [preceding word in English]: countries that 
signed the Uruguay Round will be required to follow Berne 
Convention rules for protection of artistic and literary works 
(last updated in 1971). 
  -  Computer programs (software): these will 
be protected like literary works, in the same way as 
"copyright." 
  -  Trademarks: the GATT agreement stipulates that 
marks that are well-known in a given country should be given 
additional protection. 
  -  Geographic indications (appellations of 
origin): the agreement says countries should not use geographic 
names that deceive consumers by leading them to believe that a 
product originates in a certain country. Exceptions will be made 
for names that have already become generic, probably the case 
with "champagne." 
  -  Industrial designs: will be protected for a 
10-year period. 
  -  Patents: this was the most controversial of the 
intellectual property issues discussed in the Uruguay Round. The 
TRIPS agreement grants 20-year protection on patents, whether on 
processes or products, in all fields of technology. The 
agreement excludes the following from the obligation to patent: 
therapeutic, surgical, and diagnostic methods; and plants and 
animals except microorganisms. Plant varieties, however, will be 
protected either by patents or by a unique system such as the 
one described in the "Upov Convention" that protects persons who 
improve seeds, for example. 
  -  Layout and integrated circuits: the 
agreement provides that protection in both cases will be 
provided on the basis of the May 1989 Treaty of Washington on 
integrated circuits. Protection will be granted for a minimum of 
10 years. 
  -  Layout [preceding word in English] and integrated 
circuits: the agreement provides that in both cases protection 
will be accorded on the basis of the May 1989 Treaty of 
Washington on integrated circuits. Protection will be granted 
for periods of at least 10 years. 
  -  Trade secrets and "knowhow" 
that has commercial value must be protected. 
  -  Oversight: The 
TRIPS agreement sets up a council to monitor the operations. 
There will also be a disputes resolution mechanism to hear 
litigation in the intellectual property area. 
  -  Deadlines for 
implementing the agreement: one year of transition for developed 
countries, and five years for developing countries and economies 
in transition. Those countries will have almost 11 years in 
which to implement intellectual property laws containing the 
provisions approved in the Uruguay Round. In the case of 
pharmaceuticals and chemicals products, however, developing 
countries must start accepting applications at the beginning of 
the transition period. 


    Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, who yesterday attended the 
"New World Trade Map" seminar sponsored by this newspaper, 
emphasized that "the benefits" of the incorporation of 
intellectual property subject matter into the GATT have not been 
clearly proven from the standpoint of the developing countries, 
but they at least served "to cool off bilateral pressures from 
the major partners, especially as regards patents and copyright 
aspects. It is possible that the agreement will make it easier 
for developing countries to gain access to advanced technology, 
but that will depend on the political willingness of the 
governments of the developing countries," he said. 
  Amorim recalled that the government has been trying hard to 
get the Congress to pass the substitute industrial property 
bill, now in the Senate, by 15 June -- the deadline stipulated 
in talks with the United States. But the minister emphasized 
that Congress is a sovereign power. 
  Francisco Teixeira, executive vice president of Interfarma, 
which represents 39 foreign pharmaceutical laboratories in 
Brazil, is optimistic that the substitute bill will be approved 
in the Senate by the 15th. He expects, however, that the bill 
will not return to the Chamber, which means passage will be 
delayed. In general, the multinational laboratories are 
satisfied with the provisions approved in the GATT. 
  The Brazilian government did not submit an amendment to the 
Senate that deals with this subject, but promised the 
international community it would consult the World Trade 
Organization. 
  If the consultation authorizes nonprohibition of imports, 
Brazil will have to implement that provision by 1996, Teixeira 
explained. The multinational laboratories are also satisfied 
because Brazil will ban parallel importation, thus preserving 
the rights of the patentholders in their countries of origin. 
<H5>  GATT Helps Expand Trade </H5>
  The expansion in international trade that it is hoped will 
accompany implementation of (GATT) Uruguay Round measures will 
bring trade benefits and business opportunities to various 
Brazilian production sectors. Chief among these are agribusiness 
and mines and metals, including steel, in which Brazil is quite 
competitive. 
  In the opinion of businessman Roberto Giannetti da Fonseca, 
president of Silex Trading S.A., one of the members of the panel 
on "Business Opportunities Resulting from the Uruguay Round," 
Brazilian businessmen do, however, need to improve their 
performance by investing more money in modern technologies so as 
to be able to compete. He mentioned, for example, agribusiness 
products such as fruits and the commodities (soybeans, cacao, 
coffee) that compete strongly with [as published] the United 
States. These will need heavier investment in genetic 
technologies and soil fertility. 
  Fonseca also pointed out the need for the Brazilian 
Government to decide on an industrial policy in order to outline 
the production priorities for its domestic companies, both on 
the internal market, where they compete with imported goods -- 
now facilitated by the economic "opening," -- and on foreign 
markets, where competition is stiff and demands a high degree of 
competitiveness in order to be able to make sales. 
  If Brazil is to obtain the new business opportunities that 
will be created in world trade, the businessman noted, it needs 
to assume the role of "global trader," even if timidly, although 
it is a nation with a vocation for international markets. "This 
country has one of the best foreign trade structures, quite 
diversified and well-balanced with the major trading blocs, the 
United States, Europe, Asia, and Latin America," but it is still 
one of the world's most closed economies, with annual trade 
representing only 10 to 12 percent of its GDP." According to 
Giannetti, that index could be expanded to 15 or 20 percent by 
the end of the decade. 
  Giannetti did, however, express concern about the continuity 
of the application of antidumping laws by the developed 
countries, despite their being defined in the Uruguay Round. 
"They have not been applied consistently, thus inhibiting 
Brazilian exports and new investments in products designed for 
the foreign market," he observed. 
  In the opinion of Ambassador K. Kesavapany, Singapore's 
representative to the GATT, no country is completely satisfied 
with the final results of the Uruguay Round, not even the 
developed countries like the United States. However, seven and a 
half years of negotiations led to several agreements that favor 
the expansion of business in various industrial sectors. In his 
speech at the international seminar, he emphasized ease of 
access to industrial products by companies all over the world, 
because of the reduction of tariff levels -- such as in 
textiles, apparel, and farm products -- in addition to the 
opening, for the first time, of the services sector to foreign 
companies. 
  According to Kesavapany, the tariff reduction alone is 
expected to boost world income by about $212 to $274 billion. 
That benefit, however, will not be shared equally: 65 percent of 
it will be realized by Japan, the United States, and Europe. 
<H5>  Export Subsidies Scored </H5>
  Despite fighting vigorously against incentives granted to 
the 
agricultural sector by the developed countries, Brazil still 
follows a policy of minimum price supports for products in the 
"basic market basket" that, indirectly, also generates subsidies. 
  "But it is this policy that guarantees that the government 
will buy up [excess] inventory. This is a food security policy, 
a consumer protection policy," Pedro de Camargo Neto, president 
of the Brazilian Rural Association (SRB) retorted yesterday, 
during the "New World Trade Map" seminar sponsored by this 
newspaper. "I am not a unilateral defender of the minimum price 
policy, which is an issue that is also being debated within the 
realm of Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. It is 
undeniable, however, that it leads to increases in production 
and the buildup of inventories," he pointed out. 
  The problem, Camargo Neto added, is the export subsidies. 
"These are indefensible. There is no reason to applaud a 21 
percent reduction in these subsidies. It is, in fact, a 79 
percent injustice. It means permitting that, for the sake of 
simplicity and economy of the strong powers in terms of their 
internal policies, a large part of the world will still have to 
wait, perhaps as long as six years, before it can grow," he 
stated. 
  The president of the SRB acknowledged that a good part of 
the 
difficulties encountered by Brazilian agriculture are the result 
of a failure to invest, particularly in the case of livestock. 
But, he said, that is changing. "The figure of the winter 
herdsman [invernista] , for example, who used to buy 
cattle to fatten them on grass and then sell them, is becoming 
extinct. Productivity increase programs, like that of the very 
young steers novilho precoce, are springing up every 
day. Brazilian grain producers have now achieved higher yields 
than their counterparts in the developed nations."

  [Text] "Above and beyond sectorial interests, which are 
legitimate and worthy of attention," Uruguay needs a clear 
signal on the projections and strategies that must be 
implemented in light of many more variables than those 
"pertaining to just one sector." This was asserted by Foreign 
Minister Sergio Abreu just after a long meeting with members of 
the International Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies. 
  He said the matter was discussed at length with congressmen. 
Answering a question on a possible "obstacle" as a result of 
government negotiations to find a common external tariff, the 
minister said there are no obstacles. He said the schedule that 
must be concluded by 30 June 1994 is on target. 
  Regarding the disagreement expressed by the Chamber of 
Industries, Abreu said there will be a meeting today with the 
private sector, which will offer an "opportunity to listen to 
all opinions. 
  The minister recalled that "a postponement regarding 
external 
tariffs has been sought...we want to know what arguments are 
being used. We want to know what level of political consensus 
can be achieved in such a delicate matter as this. He stated 
that Uruguay needs, beyond all sectorial interests, a clear 
signal of its prospects and national interests on this subject. 
  Regarding the possibility of approving the position of 
industrialists, Abreu stated that the current opinion is neither 
favorable nor unfavorable and that "a schedule was established 
during the January negotiations which must be fulfilled. An 
effort is therefore being made to define a common external 
tariff. This effort seeks to fulfill the various phases of the 
treaty without making any changes." 
  He said he is unwilling to close any channel, adding that 
"open dialogue is being conducted internally and externally," 
but without going outside the law. 
  Julio Maria Sanguinetti, the Batllist Forum's presidential 
candidate, stressed on 22 June during several radio interviews 
that the report published by EL PAIS on 19 June under the 
headline: "Sanguinetti: The Mercosur [Common Market of the 
South] Must Be Postponed," does not reflect reality because he 
did not propose any such thing. His remarks, which were 
broadcast by Radio Sarandi during a rally at Empalme Olmos on 18 
June, are as follows: "Through Mercosur we should be able to 
enter a new stage of transition. We have already had one stage 
of transition. The Mercosur treaty specifies that all tariffs 
will be eliminated on 1 January 1995. This is not possible, we 
must begin a new stage of transition so that another 
readjustment period of four or five years can be implemented, 
let us implement another readjustment, let us evaluate every 
situation...." 
  The expected government reaction to Sanguinetti's remarks 
was 
not long in coming. Economy and Finance Minister Ignacio de 
Posadas stressed that Uruguay's adhesion to Mercosur "is beyond 
the point of no return." He expressed concern that very 
important topics for the country--such as Mercosur and the 
exchange rate--are being used glibly for election purposes. 
During an ACDE [Association of Christian Executives] luncheon on 
22 June, the minister said: "The intention now exists to 
undermine the government in an international negotiation like 
that of Mercosur."

<F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno; from the "Union Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas has 
described recent announcements by President Rafael Caldera as 
pronouncements of sovereign measures to reestablish Venezuela's 
financial system and to recover confidence. 
  Burelli Rivas said that these measures do not harm 
Venezuela's image abroad and that instead, they signify the new 
way of governing the country with authority within the framework 
of the Constitution. He rejected the possibility that the 
measures are in any way contrary to the interests of foreign 
investors. 
  The foreign minister said that the measures have not alarmed 
foreigners because similar situations have occurred in other 
countries. He said the economic measures have produced 
expectations rather than concern about whether they will affect 
bilateral or multilateral agreements. The foreign minister said 
the suspension of some economic guarantees would have no effect 
unless they were accompanied by the suspension of some 
constitutional guarantees. 
  [Begin Burelli Rivas recording] The damage caused in the 
finance and banking system and the struggle against drug 
trafficking requires that the state should be able to arrest 
people, search for people, or prevent certain people from 
leaving the country quickly, without having to wait for a judge 
to issue an arrest warrant. 
  The economic measures alone would have served no purpose had 
they not been accompanied by the suspension of guarantees on 
free travel throughout the territory, departure from the 
country, transit in general, and the possibility of raiding the 
businesses of people supected of being involved in 
drugtrafficking activities. 
  This is the reason for the suspension of guarantees. [end

<F P=106> [Report by Maria Yolanda Garcia from the "Union Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] In the opinion of Prosecutor General Ivan Dario 
Badell, the president has the authority to suspend 
constitutional guarantees. Badell's office, however, will remain 
alert in an effort to prevent the state security corps from 
committing abuses that could result from the suspension of 
constitutional guarantees. 
  Badell said he is certain that the president adopted this 
measure because it was necessary. 
  [Begin recording] [Badell] As well as all prosecutors, I am 
addressing the police and the security corps to ask them to 
respect the lives of the citizens and not to torture anyone. I 
am asking them to respect guarantees that cannot be 
suspended--guarantees such as the right to live and the right 
not to be tortured. 
  [Reporter] Can you assure the nation that the de jure state 
has not ceased to exist in Venezuela, considering that six 
constitutional guarantees have been suspended? 
  [Badell] Of course this is not the case. The de jure state 
remains in effect. Otherwise, we would not have what we have in 
the country. The de jure state remains in effect. Only some 
constitutional guarantees have been suspended. [end recording] 
  The prosecutor general explained that although six 
constitutional guarantees have been suspended, this does not 
mean there is chaos in the country. He reiterated that his 
office continues to guarantee the security of the people. He 
noted that if any abuses are committed, appropriate punitive 
measures will be adopted.

  [Text] Following Caldera's announcement of the suspension 
of constitutional guarantees, Central Information Office 
Director Guillermo Alvarez Bajares explained the scope of the 
suspension of constitutional guarantees. 
  [Begin Alvarez recording] The first paragraph of Article 60 
states that no one shall be imprisoned or arrested unless he is 
caught in the act or by virtue of a written warrant by the 
official authorized to order arrests in the cases and 
formalities specified by the law. Summary proceedings cannot be 
extended beyond the maximum limit set by the law. The accused 
shall be entitled to have bail set expeditiously and all the 
defense means provided by the law as soon as the arrest warrant 
is executed. If a punishable crime is perpetrated, police 
authorities shall adopt the necessary or urgent provisional 
measures that are indispensable to ensure the investigation of 
the incident and the trial of the culprits. The law will 
stipulate a brief and strict time limit in which such measures 
must be take with the pertinent judicial authority. The law will 
also set a deadline for the judicial authority to issue a 
decision, with the understanding that these measures shall be 
revoked and rendered ineffective if the judicial authority does 
not confirm them by the set deadline. This first paragraph is 
suspended. 
  Article 62 establishes that residences are inviolable, and 
shall not be searched, except to prevent a crime or to comply, 
in keeping with the law, with decisions issued by the courts. 
Visits for health reasons [visitas sanitarias], conducted in 
keeping with legal stipulations, shall be made only with prior 
notice of the officials who are either ordering or conducting 
such visits. 
  Article 64 says that everyone shall move freely throughout 
the country, change abode or residence, leave the country or 
return, bring or take out possessions from the country with no 
additional restrictions than those established by the law. 
Venezuelans shall enter the country without need of any 
authorization. No government action shall impose the penalty of 
expatriation against Venezuelans, except as a commutation of 
sentence or at the request of the accused. 
  Article 96, which refers to economic rights, stipulates that 
everyone shall be free to pursue the profitable activities of 
his choice with no additional limitations other than those 
provided in this Constitution or those indicated by the laws for 
security, health, or social interest reasons. The law will 
dictate norms to avert usury, profiteering, or any other abusive 
practices aimed at hindering or limiting economic rights. 
  Article 99 guarantees the right to own property. By virtue 
of 
its social function, property ownership shall be subject to the 
contributions, restrictions, and obligations established by the 
law with regard to public use or social interest. 
  Article 101 indicates that assets of any sort shall only be 
expropriated for public use or social interest purposes through 
a final judgment and fair compensation payments. Payments can be 
deferred for a specific time period or partially canceled 
through the issue of bonds whose acceptance is obligatory in the 
following cases: property expropriations to conduct agrarian 
reform or the expansion and improvement of communities, or in 
special cases of national interest specified by the law. 
  Provisions on these constitutional articles are henceforth 
suspended. [end recording] 
  Minister Alvarez added that today the development and 
finance 
ministers will make announcements pertaining to their 
organizations. The Council of Ministers is expected to take 
further economic measures next Wednesday.

  [Text] Victor Hugo de Paola, first deputy chairman of the 
lower chamber of Congress, expressed total support for the 
measures announced by President Rafael Caldera, when he 
officially presented his candidacy for secretary general of the 
Movement Toward Socialism [MAS] party. 
  With the goal of making MAS a modern party, in keeping with 
the nation's needs, de Paola presented his candidacy as MAS 
secretary general before the electoral commission of that 
political organization. In addition, de Paola referred to the 
measures announced by the president of the Republic to which he 
gives his full support. 
  [Begin de Paola recording, in progress] ...those measures. 
One could see the onset of the serious economic crisis. This is 
a crisis, from a fiscal point of view, that became a banking 
crisis. Now it has become an exchange rate crisis because of the 
great amount of capital flight that has impoverished the nation. 
Those measures had to be taken. The measures are transitory; 
they will not last. When stability is achieved those measures 
could be suspended. [end recording] 
  De Paola is supported by several deputies and senators of 
the 
orange party [MAS] in his bid for MAS secretary general. Amongst 
his supporters is Gustavo Marquez who wants to become the 
president of the MAS. De Paola is the third to register his 
candidacy for MAS secretary general. Enrique Ochoa Antich and 
Simon Garcia already registered last month.

  [Text] Members of Congress have expressed surprise at the 
suspension of guarantees. The Democratic Action Party, National 
Convergence, and MAS [Movement Toward Socialism] have announced 
that they support the measures. MAS Deputy [Gustavo] Marquez 
said the country was in need of forceful decisions. 
  Copei [Social Christian Party], however, has asked the 
government to explain many issues that remain obscure. 
According to Copei President Hilarion Cardozo, the government's 
incoherence, the inconsistency of the measures, and the 
extemporaneous manner in which they were disclosed have 
intensified the crisis.

  [Text] Although various parliamentary [as heard] groups are 
supporting President Rafael Caldera's suspension of 
constitutional guarantees, they contend that the measures must 
be temporary in nature. 
  Hector Romero Navas, president of the Federation of 
Associations and Chambers of Commerce and Industry 
[Fedecamaras], said that the measure that meeting of the 
Fedecamaras Board of Directors, Romero Navas said the controls 
do nothing to eliminate the roots of the crisis, adding that 
there are other solutions. He said confidence can be recovered 
by giving positive signals accompanied by a unified economic 
program. He said the measures adopted by the national government 
must be temporary. 
  [Begin Romero Navas recording] We think the government 
should 
have taken this opportunity to establish a deadline, saying 
something like: We will find a solution in 30 days, or in 60 
days. It is easy to decree something, while it is more difficult 
to rescind it. The only way to step back from a situation such 
as this is to prepare a program that has strong political 
support and the support of the Venezuelan people who, in the 
end, have to be assured that we will overcome inflation. [end 
recording] 
  Berend Roosen, president of the National Council of Commerce 
and Services, said the availability of supplies will depend on 
the swiftness with which foreign exchange is delivered. He said 
that if the implementation of measures is delayed, production 
will be delayed. He said the people fear the emergence of a new 
Differential Exchange System. 
  [Begin Roosen recording] The freezing of prices will have an 
effect. We will see this happen because of price controls. It is 
also true that these controls will provide some stability, but 
in the end it is not the best thing to do. Remember the 
Differential Exchange System. It was easy to start it, but 
getting out of it was very turbulent. [end recording] 
  Regarding prices, (CAVIDEA) [expansion unknown] President 
Simon Nobile said distortions have emerged in the underground 
economy, adding that wherever price hikes have been excessive, 
prices can be lowered. 
  [Begin Nobile recording] Prices will be brought down. The 
established commercial sector maintains prices at an agreed-upon 
level. In other sectors, however, prices were above this level. 
At a time when more products are available, prices will have to 
return to their normal levels -- levels maintained by the rest 
of the commercial sector. In this sense, products marked at 
prices above normal levels will have to be adjusted. [end 
recording] 
  These sectors support the measures if they are temporary in 
nature, and they also want signs of confidence displayed, 
because, at this point in time, the eyes of the world are upon 
our country.

  [Excerpt] Caracas, 29 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Venezuelan 
Central Bank suspended the sale of foreign exchange for six days 
in order to adopt new measures to halt profiteering after the 
imposition of exchange and price controls on Monday. 
  Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera on Monday ordered the 
partial suspension of individual rights and the imposition of 
exchange controls as part of a strategy to reverse the decline 
of the economy and overcome the financial crisis. Announcing 
the drastic measures over radio and television, the president 
explained that they were necessary because the seriousness of 
the economic crisis produces "insecurity and distrust," affects 
national life, and threatens to disrupt public peace. 
  An announcement published on Tuesday in the GACETA OFICIAL 
indicated that the sale of dollars will be resumed within six 
days in order to halt the sharp fall of the bolivar against the 
U.S. dollar, the price of which went up 85 bolivares in one 
month. 
  Presidential spokesman Guillermo Alvarez Bajares announced 
that the Council of Ministers will meet today to implement the 
price and exchange controls and adopt other measures. Alvarez 
explained that individual rights were suspended to prevent the 
disruption of public order, "because there are groups interested 
in promoting disturbances," which could not be put down with the 
laws that exist in a de jure state. 
  Venezuelans awoke yesterday amid great uncertainty because, 
although price increases were prohibited, merchants "speedily" 
changed the prices of products. [passage omitted]

  [Text] After submitting to the Congress the 1995 budget 
bill, Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez said that the new 
parity of the bolivar to the dollar could be adopted during 
Wednesday's Council of Ministers. He warned that the official 
exchange rate will enter into force on 6 July but added that 
there will be controlled foreign exchange and secondary 
[marginal] exchange fed by nontraditional exports. Sosa 
Rodriguez added that the Central Bank may at some time supply 
that secondary dollar market with some foreign currency. 
  According to Development Minister Alberto Poletto, the 
regulated prices of staple products will be announced after the 
exchange rate is announced. In the minister's opinion, the price 
control measure is necessary to halt the increase in the prices 
of staple products, because hoarding has been on the rise in 
recent weeks. He believes that profound changes will take place 
when adjustments to the economy are made, mainly in terms of the 
financial crisis involving government intervention in eight 
banks and one financial corporation. That is why the measure is 
temporary and depends on the balance of the market. 
  [Begin Poletto recording] These prices should be adjusted. 
There will not be a frozen price rate. The prices will be 
adjusted inasmuch as some indicators may vary, mainly the 
monetary indicator, meaning the exchange rate of the bolivar to 
the dollar. We are trying to cover a whole range of products, 
which as we understand -- that is, what came out in the decree 
you are familiar with -- represent 80 percent of the usual and 
normal consumption of the Venezuelan people. [end recording] 
  Commenting on the services mentioned in the decree, Poletto 
indicated that regulations are in the hands of the respective 
ministries. Some services are even being controlled by contracts.

  [Text] During a news conference, Finance Minister Julio 
Sosa did not rule out the possibility of nationalizing banks. 
After presenting to Congress the draft budget for 1995 totaling 
over 2 trillion bolivars, in which the average price of 
petroleum was fixed at $12 per barrel and the bolivar was fixed 
at 180 per dollar, Sosa said that it will be necessary to ask 
Congress to pass a law on public credit to cover social 
programs. Sosa also said that the bonds announced by President 
Rafael Caldera for transportation and nourishment will have to 
be increased. Nevertheless, Minister Sosa did not say how many 
more bonds would have to be issued. 
  [Begin Sosa recording] The cabinet would have to approve 
this. [words indistinct] very satisfactory, however I do not 
want to announce this before the cabinet has taken this into 
account and given its approval. If this is dealt with tomorrow 
by the cabinet, the labor minister and I will be very happy to 
make the announcement. [end recording] 
  The finance minister also referred to the suspension of 
constitutional guarantees, ruling out that this decision was 
made to avoid public order disturbances. 
  [Begin Sosa recording] [words indistinct] taken for those 
reasons. I think that measure was implemented because there must 
be a very careful and extensive study conducted of the financial 
system. Our laws on banking and other financial institutions 
have a number of limitations that could hamper any action on the 
financial system that may be necessary. That is the true reason 
behind the suspension of guarantees. [end recording] 
  Nevertheless, and despite the insistence of the media to 
learn what the exchange rate will be fixed at, Minister Sosa 
said it was not his duty but that of the Venezuelan Central Bank 
to provide this information [words indistinct] designated a 
technical commission for that purpose. To conclude, the finance 
minister announced that the government will remain vigilant of 
the possibility of a food supply shortage, so that in fact this 
does not occur.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Rafael Caldera from Central Park in </F>
Caracas; broadcast in progress -- live] 
  [Text] ...to be able to modernize government structures; to 
make Venezuelan democracy stronger through the participation of 
the people; and to incorporate institutions and ideas that have 
developed within the context of dramatic recent changes at the 
national and international levels. 
  We, therefore, believe constitutional reform is essential 
for 
today's Venezuela. At the same time, however, we admit and 
proclaim that the success of constitutional reform must be based 
on whether it manages to understand and address the concerns, 
aspirations, desires, and needs of the nation. This is why 
prominent academic institutions are insisting on the need to 
discuss all topics related to this fundamental problem. It is 
essential that this be done in order that the idea of reform can 
thrive. This will also enable the reform to revitalize and 
strengthen the democratic institutions that were confirmed when 
the Venezuelan Constitution was approved on 23 January 1961. 
  At times, I confess, it seems as though this topic is absent 
from the overall larger issues that trouble the people. Also, 
the issue of constitutional reform is frequently precluded by 
the questionable aspiration to convene a Constituent Assembly. 
This issue has to be seriously and objectively studied. We must 
look at prior cases and examples that can guide us in reaching a 
decision. We must take into account the fact that our country's 
historic experiences clearly indicate that every attempt that 
has been made to resolve Venezuela's problems by breaking its 
institutionality have led to situations, and frequently very 
quickly, that were sometimes worse than the ones they tried to 
correct. 
  This is the situation that must be confronted today. In this 
sense, we must also remember and remind the Congress of the 
Republic that it must base its conduct and actions on two 
indispensable pronouncements: Reforms must be necessary and 
timely, and they must correspond to the Venezuelan people's 
larger concerns within the context of today; also, according to 
the text of the 1961 Constitution, the overall reform of the 
Constitution has to be submitted to a popular referendum, and 
the people have to be the ones who decide whether it is approved. 
  Therefore, Congress is not the arbiter of those institutions 
that must be reformed when the reforms are prepared solely in 
accordance with Congress' own views and interests. In terms of 
constitutional reform, Congress must interpret the people's 
will. The reform that has been discussed, prepared, and adopted 
in the legislative chambers, through the complicated process 
stipulated by the Constitution, must be submitted to the people 
for their approval and ratification. I sometimes have the 
impression that legislators lose this perspective. In turn, I 
believe it is necessary for them to remember the fact that the 
work they are going to carry out is completely useless if the 
people decide not to approve it. They have to adopt a position 
that truly represents the people's concerns, aspirations, and 
wishes. 
  When we assumed the task of preparing the reform bill, 
accepting the legislative chambers' mandate that established a 
unicameral commission, we strongly endorsed this position. We 
did this because the initial proposal to approve a new 
amendment--a third amendment to the Constitution--gradually 
changed to an overall constitutional reform, primarily because 
of the dynamic march of events in the country. We have 
emphasized this to the legislators, and we want to do this again 
now. 
  I sincerely believe this task is unpostponable. My modest 
opinion is that we should continue the initial process started 
during the previous constitutional period, because the 
Constitution establishes that once the reform process has been 
initiated, it must follow all of the procedures established for 
the approval of laws. Therefore, once the process, required by 
the Constitution, starts.... [A station reporter breaks into the 
broadcast as Caldera is in midsentence, announcing that the 
network is returning to its regularly scheduled programming.]

  [Text] The government has promised the banking sector it 
will investigate the destabilization campaign against the 
financial system, which was recently stepped up through false 
reports of bankruptcies and closures of important banks. 
  An official spokesman said: "There are no plans to intervene 
in the banks, and this has not been proposed." 
  In recent days, individuals who have no idea of the harm 
they 
are causing the nation took advantage of the last intervention 
into banks subsidized by Fogade [Deposit Guarantee and Banking 
Protection Fund] to spread rumors nationwide on new measures 
against other banks. 
  The truth is that no bank, and much less important banks, is 
currently under investigation. Whoever is spreading these rumors 
does not realize the harm being caused to the entire system. 
Instead, all of us should make an effort to contribute to the 
reestablishment of a normal situation for depositors, who have 
become very tense in the wake of the last banking crisis. 
  Meanwhile, a Finance Ministry spokesman said the law 
guarantees every depositor's savings, indicating the government 
has complied with the law, as occurred in the Banco Latino case, 
as well as in the cases of the other eight banks in which the 
government intervened. 
  In another turn of events, Interior Minister Ramon Escovar 
Salom said: "The bankers have expressed to me their justified 
concern over this campaign, which the government will 
investigate." Nevertheless, he admitted it is difficult to 
locate those responsible for spreading false reports. 
  The crux of the matter is that now campaigns against the 
so-called "solvent banks" have been stepped up, demonstrating to 
the authorities that there may be criminal intentions behind the 
rumors.

<F P=106> [By Marielba Nunez] </F>
  [Text] Recognition of about 240,000 hectares of land 
located south of Caicara del Orinoco as Piaroa territory is 
currently being requested by the representatives of that 
indigenous community, as they fear that concessions covering 
that area will be granted. This would threaten the ecology and 
the development plans they have been undertaking in recent years. 
  This is according to statements by Jose Gregorio Rodriguez, 
Miguel Gonzalez, and Guillermo Tovar, representatives of the 
Piaroa community and members of the civic association called 
Original Peoples of the Chivapure Forest Reserve, Porfochi. 
  "We want the different governmental agencies to recognize 
the 
Piaroa people of the Suapure, Parguaza, and Guaniamo River 
basins as the legitimate inhabitants of these lands. Our future 
is uncertain in this region because there are plans to exploit 
the lumber on these lands." 
  They add that they cannot agree with this possibility 
because 
it would mean the end of the organization that the Piaroas have 
achieved there. So far, to prevent the exploitation of lumber, 
they have approached the National Agrarian Institute, the 
Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock, and the agrarian court, 
which are the agencies that oversee matters concerning 
landholding among the indigenous people. 
  "We need an opportunity to continue our self-managed 
development project, which includes the rational use of natural 
resources, such as extracting seje [a kind of palm tree] oil, a 
medicinal product that can be used to cure different types of 
illnesses; producing honey; and raising buffalo. We have done 
all this through cooperatives." 
  They add that they know of the plans to grant concessions in 
these areas, and they have been denouncing this situation for 
the last four years. On several occasions they have submitted 
documents requesting that their territory in the Suapure area be 
recognized. 
  "Legally we are basing ourselves on Article 77 of the 
National Constitution, on the rights of the indigenous peoples; 
Article 2 of the Agrarian Reform, which establishes the 
recognition of the indigenous peoples' right to land; and 
Convention 169 of the International Labor Organization. This not 
only establishes our right to the land, but also our cultural 
right to conserve our language and customs."

  [Text] Havana, 18 Jun (DPA) -- The United States has 
reinforced its combat units at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, 
located 1,000 km east of Havana, a top military officer of the 
Cuban Armed Forces reported today. 
  "For several days, we have noticed the reinforcing of the 
military enclave with military personnel and equipment," said 
Division General Ramon Espinosa, Army chief in the eastern part 
of the country. 
  In a statement made to PRENSA LATINA after visiting several 
military units in the region, Gen. Espinosa said those movements 
could be part of a possible U.S. military intervention in Haiti. 
"Such an action would increase tensions in the Caribbean area," 
Gen. Espinosa said, adding that the Cuban Armed Forces should be 
alert and prepared for any eventuality. 
  "The Cuban Army in the eastern region is at full combat 
readiness to quickly and effectively repel any military action 
from the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base," Gen. Espinosa stressed.

<F P=106> [Report by reporter Rothschild Francois] </F>
  [Excerpt] The U.S. Coast Guard rescued 785 Haitian boat 
people on the high seas in three days, according to State 
Department spokesman, Michael McCurry, who adds that these 
numbers represent a significant increase in the number of people 
requesting asylum, compared to previous days. Since establishing 
the refugee control system aboard the U.S. ship, Comfort, in 
Kingston Harbor in Jamaica on 15 June, the Coast Guard has 
intercepted 1,148 Haitians, according to the spokesman. Today, 
130 were granted refugee status, while 347 saw their requests 
rejected and must be repatriated. A group of 170 Haitian boat 
people were repatriated today. Rothschild Francois reports live: 
  [Francois] As has been observed, the number of Haitian boat 
people has increased over the past few days. Yesterday, more 
than 1,000 boat people were intercepted by the U.S. Coast Guard 
and taken to Jamaica where they will be interviewed under the 
U.S. program of political asylum. A total of 170 boat people 
were repatriated to Port-au-Prince today aboard the U.S. ship, 
the Dependable, including dozens of young children. These 
refugees are mostly from Petit-Goave, Cap-Haitian. They said 
they took to the sea to escape the misery. [passage omitted] 
  It should be noted that the U.S. Embassy spokesman in 
Port-au-Prince, Stanley Schrager, was on the Port-au-Prince 
wharf when these refugees were repatriated. Schrager again 
announced that the United States encourages Haitians to apply 
for political asylum at the three centers established in Haiti 
-- in Cap-Haitian, Port-au-Prince, and les Cayes -- rather than 
risk their lives on the high seas.

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas (Mexico), 28 Jun (EFE) -- 
At least two immigration officials were killed in an attack on 
an border post in Chiapas State by a new group calling itself 
the People's National Liberation Movement [Movimiento Popular de 
Liberacion Nacional -- MPLN], state authorities reported today. 
  According to sources in the Attorney General's Office, the 
attack took place at 0400 (1000 GMT) in the municipality of 
Mazapa de Madero, 10 km from the Guatemalan border. The rebel 
Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) has its base of 
operations in the northwestern region of Chiapas, some 150 km 
from this area. 
  Authorities have begun investigating the killing of the two 
immigration officials, Luis Alonso Cordova, 46, and Lindolfo de 
Leon Castillo, 37. After the two were killed, their bodies were 
burned along with the outpost and two vehicles. 
  The authorities confirmed the area has been cordoned off 
since 1500 by members of the Army's 25th Infantry Battalion, 
which is based in the town of Motozintla, some 10 km west of the 
site of the attack. A placard was found near the area with a 
slogan painted in red: "We do not want any more clowning around 
with your electoral circus -- MPLN." Some 10 km from there, 
another placard was found with a slogan that read: "If the 
government does not fulfill its promises here and there, the 
struggle will continue -- MPLN." 
  According to Jose Santiago Garcia, mayor of Mazapa de 
Madero, 
the attack could have been staged by groups of drug traffickers 
or by traffickers of illegal Central American aliens who operate 
in the region. 
  The Interior Secretariat has asked the relevant authorities 
to conduct investigations to find those responsible for this 
criminal action. Up to now, the existence of this guerrilla 
group was not known. Authorities have been unable to confirm if 
the attack was carried out by guerrillas or by criminals linked 
to drug trafficking. 
  Last week, the self-styled Mexican Southeastern 
Revolutionary 
Peasants and Workers Front announced its demands. It threatened 
to stage an uprising if it was not included in the peace talks 
between the EZLN and representatives of President Carlos Salinas 
de Gortari's government.

  [Text] San Jose, 27 Jun (DPA) -- Costa Rican Foreign 
Minister Fernando Naranjo today said the Costa Rican Government 
will not reestablish diplomatic ties with Cuba as long as Fidel 
Castro's regime fails to promote changes leading to the island's 
democratic opening. 
  Nevertheless, Naranjo reiterated that Jose Maria Figueres' 
administration is still interested in encouraging a peaceful 
transition in the Caribbean nation. 
  In statements to the domestic media, the foreign minister 
noted that most of the countries on the continent want a 
"democratic Cuba" that can join the OAS, adding: "We believe 
that a solution to the Cuban crisis must be the product of 
exchanges and the participation of all parties interested in 
finding a solution to the problem."

<F P=106> [By Maria Edith Diaz] </F>
  [Text] Tegucigalpa -- President Carlos Roberto Reina 
yesterday evaded giving a direct answer to a question on whether 
talks have begun on the possible transfer of "gringo" troops in 
Panama to Honduras, as was hinted by U.S. Defense Secretary 
William Perry. "To open a discussion on the operation of that 
base in Honduras, a forum [foro] is needed because Palmerola is 
under Honduran jurisdiction. It is based on an agreement that 
never went to (the National) Congress, that is why it must be 
rectified," he said. 
  According to Reina, the agreement was not sent to Congress 
because at that time world tensions were very great, but now 
that there is a time of peace, international cooperation must be 
used to defend the national interests and to defend the country 
from such scourges as drug trafficking in the world. 
  The president affirmed that during U.S. Defense Secretary 
William Perry's recent visit to Honduras, the most important 
topic discussed was the role the country will have at the 
regional level in the fight against drug trafficking, an area of 
action in which the nation is at the forefront and serves as an 
example. 
  He denied the action means a greater presence of foreign 
troops in the country. He said there will be more dialogue, 
adding that on other occasions, Cubans have come to the country 
even though Honduras does not have diplomatic relations with 
their country and no one complained, as it is being planned now 
with the possible arrival of the Southern Command Marines [as 
published]. 
  "I think drug traffickers have been gradually increasing 
their presence in Honduras. This is a very grave and serious 
problem. All countries need help and the Central American 
isthmus, with an important geopolitical position, needs a lot of 
aid in this regard," Reina added. 
  Reina attributed to "a misunderstanding" the fact that the 
statements by Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar and William 
Perry did not coincide on the issue of the transfer of troops 
from Panama to Honduras. While Perry said this possibility is 
being considered, Paz Aguilar said this issue "was not 
addressed" in the recent meeting they held in Palmerola. 
  Asked whether Honduras would support an invasion of Haiti, a 
topic which it was speculated he discussed with Perry, Reina 
said "I will never express support for an invasion of any Latin 
American country, take my word." He said he would not support 
the measure, even if the United Nations decided on it, because 
he does not agree with the invasion of countries.

  [Text] Chiriqui Grande (Bocas del Toro) -- Early yesterday, 
officials of the Bocas del Toro Province Circuit Court, National 
Police units, and agents of the Police Investigation and 
Information Department (DIIP) seized about 3,000 pounds of pure 
cocaine. 
  The drugs were found at a residence under construction in 
Patillo, Chiquiri Grande District. 
  The drug seizure was made after officials of the Public 
Prosecutor's Office in Cocle Province alerted Bocas del Toro 
Province authorities on the possible existence of a drug depot 
in that district. 
  Agents of the Judicial Technical Police (PTJ), during field 
testing conducted at Bocas del Toro, confirmed that 63 boxes 
containing pure cocaine were found during the seizure carried 
out by the Bocas del Toro Circuit Court and the Drug Secretariat. 
  A police report revealed that the raided residence belongs 
to 
Juan Bautista Gomez, who was arrested on 24 June in Cocle 
Province, while transporting 136 boxes containing 2,156 kg of 
pure cocaine valued at about $50 million on the international 
market. 
  The drug seized in Bocas del Toro was packaged in small 
brown 
wrappers for distribution on the black market. 
  The authorities also arrested two Panamanians who were 
guarding the drug. Seven others were arrested later.

  [Text] Iquitos, 15 Jun -- At his first stop upon returning 
to Peru after an extensive tour of Asia and after having 
participated in the Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena, 
Colombia, President Alberto Fujimori has announced that he will 
review every file of the terrorists recently released by the 
judicial branch. 
  He said: "I am worried that outstanding terrorists were 
released by the courts. This reaffirms my belief that because 
they are dangerous (the terrorists) they should be tried by 
military courts, for the security of the country. I hope the 
judicial branch acted in accordance with the law, and that it 
did not release experienced and dangerous terrorists." 
  Fujimori added that he would study who they are and how they 
were tried. 
  He said: "If they are dangerous, the appropriate mechanisms 
will have to be found to correct this situation." 
  In another part of the news conference granted to the 
reporters who travelled with the presidential delegation, 
Fujimori reiterated his decision not to talk with ex-President 
Alan Garcia, labeling such proposals "absurd." 
  He said: "I cannot conceive of any agreement with an 
individual who destroyed the country. That can be completely 
discarded. I have no idea what motivations lie behind it." 
  Regarding his participation in the Fourth Ibero-American 
Summit, Fujimori said that in the opening session his concepts 
about the effectiveness of democracy created discussion. He 
reiterated that the goal of trying to balance the government 
branches should not go to the extreme of an inner struggle that 
would lead to the neutralization of either the executive, 
legislative, or judicial branches. 
  Fujimori added: "Fortunately in Peru there is at least a 
better coordination. The actions of the executive and 
legislative branches are not neutralized, and the judicial 
branch has greatly improved its task. Before 5 April 1992, 220 
terrorists had been released, and now over 200 have been 
sentenced to life imprisonment." 
  In this regard he agreed that certain aspects of the 
Repentance Law should be improved, but he did not say how.

<F P=106> [By Maria Helena Tachinardi in Brasilia] </F>
  [Text] Upon meeting with Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister 
Phan Van Khai on 24 June, Brazilian Foreign Celso Amorim 
announced that Brazil and Vietnam will sign a framework trade, 
economic, scientific, and technological cooperation agreement by 
the end of 1994. 
  The Brazilian Government is also requesting that Vietnam 
agree to the appointment of Italo Zappa as the Brazilian 
ambassador to Hanoi. President Franco has already authorized the 
opening of an embassy in Vietnam. 
  Since late last year, Vietnam has expressed interest in 
expanding its relations with Brazil. Vietnam sent Deputy 
Foreign Minister Le Mai first, and then Van Khai. In return, 
Itamaraty sent a trade delegation to Hanoi in April. 
  On 23 June, Khai visited Sao Paulo to hold talks with 
representatives of Maxion [agricultural machinery manufacturer], 
the CBPO [Companhia Brasileira de Projetos Obras] construction 
firm, the Odebrecht construction group, the Brazilian 
Agribusiness Association (ABAG), Ericsson [manufacturer of 
telecommunications and lighting equipment], Braspetro [Petrobras 
International Inc.], Baldan, and Marchezan [manufacturers of 
agricultural equipment]. Vietnam is interested in purchasing 
agricultural machinery, including harvesters. 
  Representatives of leading Brazilian construction companies 
attended a luncheon hosted at Itamaraty for Phan Van Khai. The 
Vietnamese market is potentially significant for Brazilian firms 
that are already established in Southeast Asia. The "chairman" 
of the Chinese company that is building the Three Gorges 
hydroelectric plant, the largest in the world, will arrive in 
Brazil on 4 July. Brazilian construction firms could form a 
consortium to participate in the Chinese project.

  [Text] The minimum wage will be $70 on 1 September. 
President Itamar Franco made this decision following a meeting 
with the finance, labor, and social security ministers, and the 
federal administration secretary. 
  Labor Minister Marcelo Pimentel later said that by the end 
of 
October the government will send Congress a draft bill outlining 
a new minimum wage policy. President Itamar said military and 
public servants will receive a salary adjustment soon after the 
implementation of the real. The president said the date for the 
wage increase has yet to be established, but it will be 
implemented even if he has to fight with his economic ministers.

  [Text] The suspension of constitutional guarantees was last 
night's big surprise, because it had been rumored all day that 
measures to control foreign exchange and prices would be 
announced. Following President Caldera's announcement, the 
reporters asked if this resolution would negatively affect 
individual and economic rights. In the end, they were clearly 
informed that the following articles of the Constitution had 
been suspended: 
  -- Paragraph 1 of Article 60 on individual freedom of 
prisoners and people who have been arrested. 
  -- Article 62 on the inviolability of residences. 
  -- Article 96 regarding economic rights. 
  -- Article 99 that guarantees the right to own property. 
  -- Article 101 that controls how assets are confiscated. 
  The government spokesmen clarified: "The economic and 
financial crisis has compelled us to make this decision, because 
it could trigger chaos or social violence. [no closing quotation 
marks as published] According to sources at the Presidential 
Palace, the government learned that a coup d'etat was being 
planned and managed to contain the plot through its intelligence 
services. It is also rumored that several generals are now under 
surveillance. Perhaps this is why we noticed that during his 
television announcement yesterday, the president was accompanied 
by military officers representing the four branches of the 
military instead of members of his cabinet. 
  As far as can be ascertained, the measures that went into 
effect last night will last as long as the government considers 
them necessary. 
  Hours before the Executive Cabinet met to give final 
approval 
to the measures, the president summoned the leaders of the 
various political parties to inform them of the strong measures 
the government would take. Although initially all parties 
agreed, some political leaders criticized the measures and 
announced they would define their positions at a later date. 
  For Radical Cause leaders, the problem lies in the fact that 
even though the emergency measures were announced to them, they 
were not told how these measures would be implemented. The 
president spoke to them in "very general terms" about a 
compensation bonus that would be based on a wage scale, and he 
also "hinted" that social programs, such as the Pami [box of 
food given to school children] and school milk programs, would 
be bolstered. The problem is that he did not say where the funds 
would come from. 
  The measures adopted yesterday certainly clarify some 
things, 
but not others. According to Deputy Melo, it is necessary to 
modify the banking system through intervention. He said that 
until the financial sector complies with its intermediary role, 
high interest rates and inflation will not be controlled. He 
said: "Structural measures need to be taken in this area." In 
fact, National Convergence party leader Jose Miguel Uzcategui 
proposed to the president that the banking system should be 
nationalized. 
  AD [Democratic Action] party leader Lewis Perez listened to 
the proposals, after which his only comment was that the CEN 
[National Executive Committee] will meet to draw up a policy. 
"My initial impression is that these are momentous measures that 
need to be analyzed together in order to see what they mean to 
the country and to the stability of Venezuela's monetary 
system." The AD Directorate is expected to issue a communique. 
  According to Freddy Munoz [senator and secretary general of 
the Movement Toward Socialism--MAS], these measures should have 
been implemented a week ago, because they are intended to stem 
the dollar outflow: "This is the only way to stop the 
skyrocketing price of the dollar and rising inflation, not to 
mention the contemptuous speculation. MAS will meet to discuss 
exchange, financial, and pricing policies."

  [Text] Regarding the suspension of constitutional 
guarantees, Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom explained that 
the right to stage peaceful demonstrations has not been 
suspended. 
  [Begin Escovar recording] I have told people that the fact 
that the guarantees have been suspended does not mean that the 
government is going to become a dictatorship, nor does it mean 
that the government is going to suppress the rights of citizens. 
I have asked them to expect a prudent attitude, a discreet, but 
at the same time stern attitude on the part of the government. 
[end recording] 
  The interior minister will meet in his office today with the 
governor of the federal district and the chiefs of the various 
security corps of the state to discuss the security situation in 
the country. The objective of the meeting is to define the 
security strategies to be followed during the time that certain 
constitutional guarantees are suspended.

  [Text] Managua, 29 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- Former Nicaraguan 
"contras" believe that the OAS can do nothing to guarantee their 
physical well-being and therefore demanded that the U.S. 
Government assume that responsibility. 
  The group of 17 former Nicaraguan "contras" who on Tuesday 
occupied the headquarters of the International Commission of 
Support and Verification of the OAS (CIAV-OAS) and six others 
who requested political asylum at the Colombian Embassy in this 
capital made that decision to protect their lives. 
  Leonardo Zeledon, alias "Chispero," told ACAN-EFE that "we 
were forced to promote this action because after four years the 
CIAV-OAS has been the only organization that has tried to 
protect our lives." "Unfortunately, in four years the CIAV-OAS 
has been unable to guarantee our lives because the government 
does not establish conditions for that," added "Chispero," a 
crippled individual who directs the occupation from a wheelchair. 
  "The North Americans armed us for war and later disarmed us 
for peace, but now that we are persecuted, jailed, and murdered 
and are jobless, nobody does anything for us," the crippled 
leader explained. "The United States must demand that our lives 
be respected," he insisted. "Chispero" asserted that clearly 
the former Nicaraguan Resistance "cannot offer more lives" and 
urged the U.S. Government to protect their lives. 
  The Managua Government has remained silent on the CIAV-OAS 
occupation, although it was learned Government Minister Alfredo 
Mendieta talked over the telephone with CIAV Coordinator Sergio 
Camarena. Details of the conversation between the minister and 
the CIAV official are not known. 
  The former contra leader, who during the civil war was 
personnel chief of the "San Jacinto" Task Force," one of the 
battalions of the defunct "contras," warned that the occupation 
is "peaceful but indefinite." "Before, the CIAV-OAS was a 
shadow protecting the demobilized, but now it only overshadows 
the dead," the crippled leader stated. 
  "Chispero" said the government pledged to support the return 
of the demobilized to civilian life and it has not complied. He 
added it cannot guarantee recontras the means to support 
themselves with land to produce, work, and education. He 
admitted that the six demobilized individuals who sought refuge 
at the Colombian Embassy are part of a "struggle and liberty" 
plan that will be implemented day after day nationally, with 
progressive actions he did not detail. 
  "Chispero" reported he is a member of the Nicaraguan 
Resistance Superior Council, which is also trying to unite all 
former "contra" trends and protect the demobilized. In 
addition, the Nicaraguan Resistance Superior Council follows up 
on the agreements the government has allegedly failed to comply 
with on the delivery of land, work, and education for the former 
contras' return to civilian productive, social, and political 
life. 
  According to "Chispero," approximately 50 men who took up 
arms under Jose Angel Talavera, alias "Chacal," and who had 
demobilized, returned to the mountains in northern Nicaragua 
bearing their weapons to protect their lives. "The 184,000 
families that the CIAV-OAS repatriated are not doing anything, 
and it is best that they be removed from here and sent wherever 
they want so they cannot be hunted down like dogs," said 
"Chispero" in one of the hallways of the CIAV-OAS headquarters. 
  Meanwhile, Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal called 
on 
the six former "contras" occupying the Colombian Embassy to 
leave that mission and "make use of legal procedures to demand 
their claims." "In our country there are no persons who are 
persecuted, nor will there be, for political reasons by the 
administration of Violeta Chamorro," the foreign minister 
declared. 
  The facilities of the Embassies of Venezuela and Italy, the 
United Nations, as well as the cathedrals in Managua and Esteli, 
were also occupied weeks ago by groups of former Sandinist 
soldiers pressuring for solutions to their problems.

<F P=106> [Report by Maria Lourdes Osorio; from the "National </F>
Newscast" -- passages within quotation marks recorded] 
  [Text] Two groups of alleged members of the Nicaraguan 
Resistance [RN] unexpectedly this morning invaded the offices of 
the CIAV-OAS [International Commission of Support and 
Verification-OAS] to demand that the government fulfill its 
agreements. 
  [RN leader Leonardo Zeledon, alias Chispero] "The CIAV-OAS, 
as guarantor of the verification of the agreements signed with 
the RN, take us out of here, gentlemen." 
  Simultaneously, six persons led by Luis Arguello Ortiz, 
known 
among the former RN members as 02 [Cero Dos], entered the 
Colombian Embassy to demand political asylum. 
  [Arguello] "We are requesting political asylum because the 
approval of the military code would lead to the total 
extermination of the RN." 
  Colombian diplomatic authorities are reviewing the situation 
of the six persons, who remain at the South American diplomatic 
mission. 
  [Colombian Ambassador Jorge Villamizar] "We are evaluating 
everything, the information given to us and the request they are 
making. There are six persons. They entered peacefully, there 
has been no act of violence. Everything is normal inside the 
embassy. We can come and go as we please as you can see. There 
is no repressive action at this time. Everything is peaceful." 
  In view of the situation, Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal said 
that in Nicaragua there is freedom of expression. 
  [Leal] "I believe that if they are members of the RN party, 
the party will be able to make its demands civically. If they 
are from the Sandinist National Liberation Front [FSLN], the 
FSLN will be in charge. I believe we Nicaraguans must begin 
learning how to do things. We do not see any need to request 
political asylum because there is and there will be no political 
persecutions here at least while the government of President 
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro is in power." 
  Luis Arguello Ortiz, who is now at the Colombian Embassy, 
has 
a case pending in the justice system. 
  [National Police Chief Fernando Caldera] "One of the 
persons, 
who is now at the Colombian Embassy, had been arrested for 
committing a crime. These people are really not [word 
indistinct]. I believe there are dark elements in this 
organization. There are dark interests that must be [words 
indistinct] so that we can have an idea of [passage indistinct]." 
  It all seems to indicate that the occupation of the CIAV-OAS 
and the Colombian Embassy is part of a plan and that is why the 
National Police have conducted operations in certain parts of 
the capital. 
  How does the National Police chief view this situation? 
  [Caldera] "There is obviously an attitude against the 
Nicaraguan Government, but it is not only against the Nicaraguan 
Government. We must remember that the Colombian Embassy and the 
CIAV-OAS offices have been occupied and that the next secretary 
general of the OAS will be the current Colombian President, 
Cesar Gaviria, who will replace Joao Baena Soares. There is 
obviously a manipulation [words indistinct]." 
  [Unidentified speaker] "What measures will be taken 
to...[words indistinct]?" 
  [Caldera] "We are currently conducting measures aimed at 
preventing further incidents from taking place. We have adopted 
measures. We have already taken to the streets. We have set up 
checkpoints, and we are patrolling the streets." 
  Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo said the individuals who 
entered the Colombian Embassy and the CIAV-OAS are citizens who 
are violating the country's laws and international agreements. 
They cannot be members of the former RN because the former 
members of that organization have their dialogue channels with 
the government open. 
  [Lacayo] "The members of the RN have their legitimate 
representatives. These are Nicaraguan citizens who are 
violating the law. I do not see any RN member there. The young 
man called Luis Arguello was apparently not even a demobilized 
member of the RN. He is the one called Chispero. You know him. 
I do not think they have to [words indistinct] within the 
framework of the law. We have contacted the Colombian Government 
and the OAS to take coordinated action. They are Nicaraguan 
citizens, who are violating international agreements. No one 
has the right to occupy a diplomatic mission [words indistinct]."

<F P=106> [From the "Extravision" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The former members of the Nicaraguan Resistance [RN] 
who this morning occupied the Colombian Embassy and the CIAV 
[International Commission of Support and Verification]-OAS 
offices have continued to demand that the government negotiate 
with Enrique Quinonez, a member of RN's Higher Council. This 
evening Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta said there would be 
no negotiations. 
  [Begin Mendieta recording] I would like to point out that 
Mr. 
Luis Ignacio Montiel, from Comalapa, Chontales, 37, was never a 
member of the RN as he claims. He participated in highway 
occupations in 1990 and, subsequently, was involved in 
considerable criminal activities. He was arrested for a murder 
in Nueva Guinea Department. According to his record, in 1980 he 
was charged with the murder of an Agriculture Ministry employee, 
and in 1991 he again participated in highway occupations and 
other acts of protest against the government. 
  Mr. [indistinct] Madariaga, 36, a former member of the 
National Guard and a former member of the [word indistinct], was 
discharged in December of the same year [as heard] and 
reenlisted in the National Guard in January 1979. He 
subsequently left the country and returned after the 1990 
elections. 
  I have sufficient evidence to assert that there have been 
ties between these individuals and followers of Charrito and 
Northiel. Over the past week the two sectors even held 
conversations. [end recording] 
  The government minister also asserted that today's actions 
are linked to actions by Northiel and Charrito in northern 
Nicaragua. These actions, he said, are financed by Quinonez and 
other members of the former RN. 
  [Begin Mendieta recording] If Mr. Quinonez' involvement in 
today's incidents is clearly proven, and, if after today's 
meeting such ties are clearly established, Mr. Quinonez will be 
arrested. [end recording] 
  The government minister did not dismiss the possibility that 
the occupiers of the Colombian Embassy and the CIAV-OAS 
headquarters may be dislodged this evening. 
  [Begin Mendieta recording] I have asked the Colombian 
ambassador, through the Foreign Ministry, to authorize the 
police to dislodge them, and we are awaiting Colombia's answer. 
We are making the same request of the CIAV-OAS to immediately 
dislodge the occupiers. [end recording]

  [Text] Managua, 29 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- Some 20 former contras 
occupied the offices of the Nicaraguan Institute for Agrarian 
Reform (INRA) in the city of Chinandega today, Wednesday, to 
support similar actions staged in Managua by two other former 
anti-Sandinist rebels. 
  One of the occupiers, who identified himself as "Commander 
Piloto," read a communique on a Managua radio station to 
announce that the peaceful occupation is part of the actions 
being carried out by fomrer contras to demand that the 
government fulfill the obligations in 1990 demobilization 
agreements. 
  "We are demanding that we be given land, credits for 
productive programs, housing, and security for our lives," the 
leader of the occupiers stated. 
  The occupation of the INRA building in Chinandega, 120 km 
west of Managua, is "in support of other brothers who maintain 
their demands" in Managua, stated the leader of the group. The 
group consists of 20 people, including men and women. 
  Since Tuesday, a group of former contras have occupied the 
headquarters of the International Commission of Support and 
Verification (CIAV-OAS). Six other former members of the 
Nicaraguan Resistance are occupying the Colombian Embassy, where 
they have requested asylum. 
  Nicaraguan authorities said today that they will not 
negotiate with the former contras. Authorities consider these 
acts of protest dangerous for the country's stability.

  [Text] Managua, 29 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- A group of six former 
commanders of the former Nicaraguan Resistance [RN] today 
rejected the occupation by former contras of an OAS organization 
headquarters and of the Colombian Embassy in Managua to protest 
alleged non compliance with the agreement signed in 1990 for 
their disarmament. 
  The six former commanders, who said they represent the 
chiefs 
of the four war fronts of the defunct contra group, said during 
a news conference that the occupations are lead by Enrique 
Quinonez, "who never was a legitimate RN member." 
  They also appealed to the true former members of the 
Resistance, who are currently at the OAS International 
Commission of Support and Verification (CIAV-OAS) building and 
those who are at the embassy, to "not engage in actions that 
damage the organization's image." 
  In addition, they asked the government to comply with "what 
is lacking" in the agreements (Toncontin, Honduras; Olof Palme; 
and Hotel Las Mercedes) signed between 1989 and 1990 for the 
overall reintegration process of the demobilized and of the 
former contras. 
  Rodolfo Ampie, alias "comandante Invisible;" Luis Angel 
Lopez, alias "comandante Leonel;" Edgar Molinares, alias 
"comandante Richard;" Salvador Talavera, alias "comandante 
Esteban;" Jorge Avalos, alias "comandante Avalos;" and Erving 
Barberena, alias "comandante Oscar" are the former RN commanders 
who appealed to the occupiers to "think over their attitudes." 
  According to "comandante Invisible," Violeta Chamorro's 
government has only complied with 40 percent of the agreements 
on the delivery of over 400,000 manzanas of land (571,428 
hectareas) to former contras. 
  More than 1,000,000 manzanas (1.4 million hectareas), as 
well 
as houses, work tools, and urban lots for the construction of 
homes are still pending delivery. 
  Other former contra chiefs indicated that at "Reparto 380" 
and "Hialiah" [temporary living facilities] in this capital the 
demobilized have not received materials for the construction of 
housing, while in the "Villa Reconciliacion," the houses lack 
electricity and potable water. 
  In addition, they pointed out that thousands of former 
contras, after returning to their places of origin and finding 
themselves without jobs, left behind their families again to go 
to Managua with the hope of solving their problems, but this has 
not happened. 
  The peaceful occupation for the second day of the CIAV-OAS 
is 
being lead by disabled commander Lorenzo Seledon, alias 
"Chispero," while the action at the Colombian Embassy is being 
lead by Jose Luis Arguello Montiel, alias "commander 002." 
  Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta accused the occupants 
of 
the diplomatic mission of committing crimes of extortion, 
threats, coercion, and kidnapping. He said the government will 
not negotiate with these people. 
  This afternoon, a lengthy meeting was held at the CIAV-OAS 
headquarters. Present at the meeting was Monsignor Eddy 
Montenegro, who was representing Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo. 
However, no representative of the Violeta Chamorro government 
was present. Also present at the meeting were Argentine 
diplomat Sergio Caramagna, CIAV-OAS general coordinator; Enrique 
Quinonez, representing the RN Superior Council, which consist of 
57 leaders of the demobilized rank and file; and "Chispero." 
However, results from the meeting were scarce. 
  Today, approximately 20 demobilized and former contras 
occupied the offices of the Nicaraguan Institute of the Agrarian 
Reform in Chinandega, in the western part of the country, in 
support of the similar actions in Managua.

  [Text] The IMF Board unanimously approved yesterday a $173 
million loan to Nicaragua to be dispensed over the next three 
years, the Presidency's Communications Directorate announced 
last night. 
  The IMF noted that among the reasons for granting the loan 
is 
the Nicaraguan Government's commitment to promote an economic 
program "that will achieve 3 percent real growth in the Gross 
Domestic Product next year," the source added. 
  The directorate added that "in a new commitment to 
Nicaraguan 
society the IMF sympathized with the social conditions of 
Nicaragua's neediest" and that "the new ESAF [Enhanced 
Structural Adjustment Facility] includes programs to upgrade 
health and education," as well as a Social Investment Fund for 
the benefit "of the hardest hit" sectors. 
  The Social Investment Fund is aimed at "the most vulnerable 
segments of society" and will generate "more jobs, alleviate 
poverty," and upgrade the conditions of those hit the hardest by 
the war, the Directorate's communique indicated. 
  On another matter, the IMF said that "it has taken note" of 
the Nicaraguan Government's view on the need to restructure its 
foreign debt "under concessional terms." One can infer from 
this that the international financial organization would support 
the request the Nicaraguan Government will make along those 
lines in September when it goes to negotiate with the Paris Club. 
  In the September meeting, the government will ask that all 
the foreign debt stocks [preceding word in English] -- probably 
as much as $500 million -- be forgiven. Although the foreign 
debt to the Paris Club does not represent the bulk of what the 
government owes, it is important because the countries that 
belong to the Club are the ones currently granting the greatest 
volume of financial aid to Nicaragua. 
  In addition, the IMF loan to Nicaragua is in keeping with

  [Text] Caracas, 29 Jun (AFP) -- The foreign ministers of 26 
nations and 11 dependent territories agreed here today to create 
the Association of Caribbean States (ACS). The document must 
now be countersigned by the respective chiefs of state and 
government in July. 
  Tonight, the foreign ministers signed a document 
establishing 
the framework of the ACS, which will be an organization of 
consultation, joint efforts, and cooperation aimed at promoting 
expanded economic trade and investment projects. 
  Among the countries joining the ACS are members of the 
Caribbean Community (Caricom), Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, El 
Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, 
the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela. 
  The presidents meeting that will ratify the ACS shaping 
document will be held 24 July in a yet-to-be-determined country, 
Foreign Ministry sources told AFP. In addition to promoting 
economic integration, the ACS proposes active and coordinated 
participation in multilateral forums, environmental protection, 
and conservation of regional natural resources, particularly in 
the Caribbean Sea. 
  The ACS will have full members and observers, and its 
permanent organizations will include a Council of Ministers and 
a Secretariat. The Secretariat will be headed by a secretary 
general, who will be elected by the Council of Ministers every 
four years. Also, the Council of Ministers will establish a 
special fund designed to support technical cooperation and 
research programs. 
  The document signed by the foreign ministers says: "None of 
the positions outlined in the current agreement should be 
interpreted as conflicting with the rights and obligations of 
the parties in regard to other agreements." The document adds 
that these positions will not affect "other existing mechanisms 
of cooperation, joint effort, and consultation."

    [Editorial Report] Lima EL PERUANO in Spanish on 22 Jun, 
pages B6-B7, carries a 1,200-word report by Paul Neil Herrera 
Guerra on a workshop held by the Andean Parliament on 24-25 May 
in La Paz, Bolivia, entitled "Framework Law for Money Laundering 
and Legalizing Capital." 
  Among the experts of the region who addressed the event was 
Luis Lamas Puccio, who spoke for Peru on the problem of money 
laundering. The workshop recommended that the legalization of 
capital should be classified as a crime. He said this move 
should not be applied solely to drug trafficking money, but also 
to money obtained from other crimes. A series of mechanisms to 
identify this crime were made, as well as recommendations on 
bank secrecy to prevent banks and financial institutions from 
laundering ill-gotten money. It was also suggested that 
institutions controlled by banking, insurance, credit, and 
capital markets laws, together with enterprises engaged in 
construction, real estate, the marketing of vehicles, precious 
stones, and metals, and money exchange should help the 
government to identify ill-gotten assets. Mechanisms to control 
the marketing of real estate were also proposed. 
  As for money laundering, the workshop recommended the 
drafting of a framework law based on OAS regulations regarding 
this crime, leaving each country of the region free to classify 
the crime and adopt punishments. Lastly, it was recommended 
that this framework law should include mechanisms, compatible 
with those of other countries, for the confiscation of assets 
obtained through money laundering and the legalization of 
capital, even at the request of another country.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, </F>
in Caracas, by Roberto Cavada in Havana, on 29 June; from the 
"National Radio News" -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Cavada] What is on the first day's agenda of the 
foreign ministers meeting? 
  [Robaina] The opening ceremony is scheduled for 1100. There 
is a document ready to be discussed by the foreign ministers. 
This document covers the fundamental guidelines by which the 
association should function. As of 1100, we will begin this 
meeting that should last all day, and which is to approve the 
document that will be presented to the heads of state. 
  [Cavada] It is being said that documents presented by 
Caricom 
[Caribbean Common Market], Latin American Economic System, the 
Economic Commission for Latin America, and the Central American 
Integration System have been discussed. These are all economic 
institutions and organizations. Does this mean that the future 
Association of Caribbean States could have a prominent role in 
the economy of the area? 
  [Robaina] Yes, the main drive of this initiative, which has 
received tremendous support from Caricom in the first place, and 
from the 37 countries of the Caribbean Basin, is fundamentally 
economic -- economic, but with new game rules because it is also 
the only economic organization that deals with environmental 
issues, social policies, and many other related issues as well. 
  I believe that today, we start on a path toward establishing 
new game rules. The special characteristic of these game rules 
is that many countries are not characterized by large resources. 
They are characterized today by the desire to see this area, 
which although geographically linked a long time....[end

  The financial aid will be managed by nongovernmental 
organizations who work with the EU, and will be allocated as 
follows: 
  1. Two million dollars will be used to purchase and 
distribute medicine and raw materials to produce the neovitamin 
tablets used against optical neuritis. 
  2. Four million dollars will be used to stock hospitals 
with medical supplies such as sheets, hygiene products, and 
surgical, orthopedic, and sanitary supplies. 
  3. Eight thousand dollars will be used for drinking-water 
purification. 
  4. The rest will be used to acquire and distribute food 
staples such as powdered milk, oil, cheese, canned meat and 
fish, fruits, vegetables, and baby food. 
  The EU's aid will be distributed according to regional 
mortality indexes, and urban population density.

  [Text] Havana, 26 Jun (EFE) -- For the first time ever, an 
official delegation from Spain's conservative People's Party 
[PP], the principal opposition party in Spain, has established 
contacts with Fidel Castro's government during a visit to 
Havana. In addition, the PP delegation also took the 
opportunity to meet with representatives of Cuba's domestic 
opposition. 
  Guillermo Gortazar, PP deputy and party secretary, and 
Information Office Director Miguel Angel Rodriguez told EFE the 
visit was "a goodwill gesture by the PP, and it has been fully 
satisfactory and the objectives have been met." 
  Gortazar stressed that they conveyed "a message of accord" 
to 
the Cuban authorities in the event of a change of government in 
Spain, but they also made it clear that the PP would suggest 
recommendations to initiate a process of political opening. 
  He added that, so far, the PP has demanded improvements in 
the treatment of political prisoners, amnesty, and an 
acknowledgement of the right to association, just as the current 
Constitution envisions. 
  "Economic changes must translate into genuine political 
changes to enable the people to voice protests that will stem 
from the required adjustment measures," the deputy pointed out 
after warning that some Cuban leaders recognize the risk of a 
"social explosion," particularly in Havana. 
  "Deregulation and opening are a matter of common sense and 
political prudence, and it is up to the current leaders to 
equitably conduct this process from within the government," 
Gortazar stated. 
  Miguel Angel Rodriguez insisted that the changes "must be 
carried out from within," and he pointed out that the term most 
used during his meetings was that of "reconciliation." 
  Gortazar and Martinez who today, Sunday, ended a visit that 
began on Wednesday, met with Jose Ramon Fernandez, vice 
president of the Council of Ministers; Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina; Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly of 
the People's Government [ANPP]; and Jose Ramon Machado Ventura 
and Jose Ramon Balaguer, members of the Cuban Communist Party 
[PCC] Central Committee Politburo who are responsible for 
propaganda and ideology. 
  "This is the first time," Martinez pointed out, "that a PP 
mission has been received by the Central Committee." 
  The PP representatives, who stressed "the receptiveness" of 
the meetings, said their party will invite between eight and 10 
Cuban officials to a seminar on "political transition" that will 
be held in Madrid in the autumn. 
  Both PP leaders noted that Cuban authorities expressed great 
interest in establishing closer ties with the PP, as 
demonstrated by the fact that official interviews included on 
their itinerary were not canceled following their meeting with 
some members of Cuba's domestic opposition. "This establishes a 
precedence and is evidence that the Cuban authorities' interest 
in the PP is very high," Miguel Angel Martinez stated. 
  Human rights activists Elizardo Sanchez Santacruz, Vladimiro 
Roca, Rene del Pozo, Jesus Yanes Pelletier, and Gustavo Arcos, 
as well as others, participated in meetings with the PP. 
According to Gortazar, they said, "the government is giving out 
false signals of change, while, at the same time, the human 
rights situation is deteriorating."

  [Text] Havana, 26 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Today, the Cuban 
authorities announced a new massive transportation system for 
Havana based on modified locally manufactured trucks to relieve 
the serious transportation shortage. 
  Cuba will attach cargo and dump truck cabs to the chassis of 
conventional buses to create a "super train-bus" ["super 
tren-bus"] with a 315-passenger capacity, according to the 
official plan disclosed here. The "super train-bus," 
manufactured at an industrial plant on the outskirts of Havana, 
operates in a limited fashion in the city and is known by the 
people as a "camel" due to a sort of "hump" resulting from its 
peculiar assembly. 
  With the new system, which covers seven main thoroughfares 
in 
Havana, the authorities expect to turn around the shrinking 
capacity of the 2.1 million inhabitants of this capital to 
mobilize. In the past three years, the Cuban transportation 
system has been strangled by the currency deficit and the lack 
of batteries, spare parts, accessories, and tires. Public 
transportation in Havana was reduced from 30,000 daily trips at 
the beginning of the decade to approximately 7,500, according to 
an official assessment. 
  Some 500,000 bicycles that circulate in the Cuban capital 
reduced the transportation shortage but are not enough to 
resolve the demand of 4.2 million [figure as received] people 
who, according to the authorities, mobilize everyday in the city. 
  The plan foresees adding 260 "super train-buses" by the 
middle of next year and refurbishing approximately 200 
conventional passenger "Ikarus" buses, which were made in 
Hungary. The remaining bus routes that are still operating in 
Havana, but with growing limitations, will be reorganized so as 
to support the "camel" thoroughfares. 
  The total fleet of passenger vehicles in the capital is 
1,176, with an average of 437 in working condition. For next 
year, the goal will be to have 1,145 available, of which 916 
will circulate.
