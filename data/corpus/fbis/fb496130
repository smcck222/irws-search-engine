  [Text] The United States and the PRC are the two countries 
that conduct the most unfair trade practices in the Mexican 
market. Together, they are responsible for 56 percent of all 
cases of dumping reported in the current six-year period, 
according to a study conducted by the Dumping and Subsidies 
Investigations Directorate under the Unit of International Trade 
Practices of the Commerce and Industrial Development Secretariat 
(SECOFI). 
  The document says that in the current six-year period, 
approximately 108 dumping investigations have been conducted to 
detect cases in which foreign producers are selling products at 
lower than normal prices in the Mexican market, which hurts 
Mexican industries so much that they are driven to the verge of 
bankruptcy. 
  Of a total of 108 cases investigated, 43 have to do with 
products coming in from the United States and 17 from the PRC, 
followed by 12 investigations into Brazilian products and five 
into German products. 
  Figures show that 39.81 percent of all investigations have 
been conducted against U.S. products brought into the country 
under unfair trade conditions, while 15.74 percent of all 
investigations involve PRC products. 
  The countries that have committed the least number of unfair 
trade practices against Mexico have been those from the Asian 
bloc and from Latin America, but in the case of Latin American 
nations, the document notes that trade with these countries is 
very limited. 
  The analysis conducted by SECOFI reveals that most of the 
countries with which Mexico trades have been the object of two 
or more dumping investigations, but in the case of the United 
States, the number of unfair trade practices committed in the 
Mexican market is extraordinary. 
  Among the countries that in the past five years have been 
the 
object of only one dumping investigation by the Mexican trade 
authorities are Argentina, France, India, Japan, Malaysia, the 
Netherlands, Pakistan, and Chile. Belgium, the EC, Colombia, 
and Taiwan have been the object of only two dumping 
investigations each under the current administration, the 
document states. 
  As for the products involved, the ones that "suffered" most 
from unfair trade practices were those from the chemical 
industry, oil byproducts, and rubber and plastic products, and 
these comprised 40 percent of the dumping cases reported during 
the current administration. These products are followed by 
those from the basic metal industry with 17 percent of all 
investigations and the textile sector with 12 percent of cases 
of unfair trade. In the same order of importance, metal 
industry products, machinery, and equipment -- including, among 
other products, microcomputers, telephone adapters, 
transformers, and tools -- account for 10 percent of all 
investigations. 
  Toys, shoes, and electrical appliances, including 
refrigerators, account for 7 percent of the total number of 
registered cases. Nonmetal products -- fluorite, cement, 
artificial corundum, and ceramic coating [recubrimiento 
ceramico] -- account for 5 percent of the total number of 
dumping cases, followed by products from the paper and printing 
press industry. 
  Food products account for the least number of 
investigations; 
cases of unfair trade practices have only been reported in the 
marketing of fish meal, beef, pork, and cationic starch.

  [Text] Mexico City, 26 Jun (EFE) -- Gabriel Larrea, 
president of the Mexican Copyright Institute (IMDA), has told 
EFE that the piracy business is dealing a fatal blow to 
intellectual property rights because for each original, five 
pirated copies are sold on the black market. 
  "If the author is not reimbursed, he is discouraged from 
continuing to create," said Larrea, who calls piracy -- the 
practice of copying originals to sell copies on the black market 
-- the greatest economic and moral wrongdoing suffered by 
creative people. 
  Mexico's copyright tradition dates back to the 19th century, 
although the first Mexican copyright law was passed in 1947 and 
the current copyright law in 1963. The 1963 law guarantees an 
author protection equivalent to his lifetime plus an additional 
75 years after his death before his works enter into public 
domain. 
  Other Latin American countries face the same problems in 
protecting the rights of authors. Currently, the countries 
which are most interested in improving their copyright laws are 
Argentina, Colombia, Brazil, Venezuela, and Costa Rica. 
  "A great effort has been made to protect the rights of 
authors in these countries," says Larrea, who stressed Latin 
America's intention to join the Ibero-American Organization of 
the Rights of Authors (Finauto), which was created in Costa Rica 
in May. This organization will compile catalogues of production 
companies, recording companies, and users so authors will be 
better protected inside and outside of Ibero-America, Larrea 
said. 
  Larrea believes the economic loss is "fatal" to authors 
because for each record sold legally, as many as five illegal 
copies are sold in the underground economy. This harms the 
authors who, faced with the exploitation of their works without 
receiving any benefits, prefer to produce fewer works. 
  According to the Mexican Record Producers Association, 
illegal production exceeds legal production five-fold and serves 
as an arrow that pierces personal creativity affecting industry, 
culture, and society. 
  Larrea said the protection of the authors rights is "sacred 
property," adding that "the idea that the expression of the 
creator must be protected" is still upheld in Mexico as a 
continuation of its European tradition. 
  Meanwhile, there is an Anglo-Saxon culture that is more 
concerned about preserving the right of businessmen to copy 
works, although in the long run they protect intellectual 
production through these works, Larrea added. 
  Mexican authorities and the Attorney General's Office under 
the leadership of Humberto Perez Trevino have promised to fight 
piracy, but a spokesman for the Prosecutor's Office told EFE 
that his office did not have any figures on the number of 
articles confiscated. 
  It has recently been reported that in 1994, more than 1 
million illegally copied records were confiscated, the 
production of which greatly affected producers and authors. 
  Copyrights should be protected because they represent an 
investment in producing culture. If copyrights are not 
protected, then no one will want to invest in production, Larrea 
said. Larrea is the well-known lawyer who defended singer Juan 
Gabriel in a lawsuit against a record company to recover the 
copyrights of more than 500 songs. 
  For the IMDA president, piracy not only involves those 
individuals who copy something: "Many others are behind this 
phenomenon because capital, distribution channels, and storage 
facilities are needed; in other words, there is a pirating 
industry." 
  Larrea believes that fighting piracy does not merely 
comprise 
confiscating illegal copies on the black market. He said: 
"People must be reminded of authors rights because if we do not 
know what those rights are, we begin to fail to recognize the 
rights of intellectuals." 
  Copyrights should be balanced with society's ability to 
accept the following facts: on one hand, society must recognize 
that authors have material rights, and on the other, that 
authors are exploited by industry.

<F P=106> [Report by Daniel Pensamiento] </F>
  [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez -- After agreeing to the immediate 
sale of 44,000 hectares of land in the conflict zone, small 
landowners and cattlemen have given authorities eight days to 
evict Indian and peasant groups from approximately 400 tracts of 
property; otherwise, they will begin the evictions themselves. 
  During a meeting, the small landowners rejected the 
government's proposal to begin the evictions on 31 August at the 
conclusion of the negotiations on the sale of the land and the 
relocation of the groups. 
  Rodolfo Ulloa, secretary general of the state government in 
Chiapas, said the state administration is willing to carry out 
the evictions but that dialogue and consensus must prevail in 
order not to hinder the peace negotiations. "We are willing to 
undertake the actions you demand, but we must contribute to 
reaching peace agreements," he said. 
  Francisco Escudero, a representative of small landowners in 
the Soconusco area, warned that the region's producers will 
begin to recover the land if the government continues to be 
indifferent to the eviction of the Indian and peasant groups. 
  Escudero said: "We can no longer tolerate this. We are sorry 
the government is closing the door on us. How can the 
government wait until 31 August to begin the evictions?" He 
added: "We cannot accept this. This is why we made it very 
clear that if by 4 July there is no reply, we will begin to 
evict people from our farms, and the government will be 
responsible for what happens." 
  The small landowners have been picketing the Government 
Palace, and their trucks and tractors have been blocking the 
city's main square for the past 72 hours to demand the evictions.

  [Excerpts] Haitian employers are going to institute legal 
proceedings in the United States against the latest sanctions on 
Haiti by President Bill Clinton. This is what Raymond Roy, 
president of the Haitian Chamber of Commerce and Industry 
[CCIH], said. The legal action is directed especially at the 
list of 237 persons whose accounts have been frozen. Those 
people include a handicapped person, who was the victim of 
political violence; children; and deceased persons, asserted the 
CCIH, which has called on Haitians to mobilize. Roy described 
those sanctions that also limit transfers from Haitians living 
abroad to their deprived relatives in Haiti to $50 per person 
and per family as illegal. Criticizing the position of the 
United Nations in the Haitian crisis for letting itself be led 
by the United States, Roy pointed out that the Haitian 
employers' organizations were going to write to UN Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to denounce those measures. Let us 
listen to the explanations of Jean Luckenson: 
  [Begin Luckenson recording, in Creole] The country's 
economic situation is very alarming, even moribund. Our 
businesses are closed; the international community is 
assassinating the Haitian people. In the next few days, we are 
going to retain Haitian and foreign lawyers in order to try to 
attack the U.S. Government's unfair and criminal executive 
order. Clinton is wrong. Such a measure should be taken by the 
United Nations. I was quoting from CCIH President Raymond Louis 
Roy following a meeting held by about 50 employers who are 
members of an association of Haitian employers and 
industrialists. The meeting, held on Tuesday 28 June at 1130, 
was held to discuss the latest measures taken by the head of the 
U.S. Government on 15 June to force the military leaders to give 
up power. Those measures were the freezing of the funds abroad 
of those who support the putschists and the suspension of 
commercial flights. [passage omitted] 
  The CCIH president severely criticized the latest measures 
taken by the head of the U.S. Government. According to Roy, who 
was wearing a white guayabera shirt with a button saying No to 
Occupation on his chest, the international community wants to 
bring about international genocide against the Haitian people. 
The latest sanctions have spared no one. So, the avalanche is 
under way, taking away all that it finds in its path no matter 
whether it be trash, straw, grass, or what have you. The U.S. 
Government took measures against all those who are supporting 
the putschists. According to many observers, the CCIH members 
have not been spared. [passage omitted] 
  Roy said they have analyzed the latest sanctions and are 
looking for a solution so they do not end up in a grave. He 
invited all staunch Haitians, who are the victims of the 
international community's claws through the latest sanctions, to 
a mass to be celebrated on 4 July to protest the embargo and 
foreign occupation in Haiti. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Romel Manigat, senator elected during the contested 
18 January 1993 elections and vice president of Bernard 
Sansaricq's unofficial Senate office, said U.S. President Bill 
Clinton is a sick person. This statement was made following the 
Clinton administration's recent decision to suspend the visas of 
all 18 January senators except Serge Gilles, general coordinator 
of the Nationalistic Progressive Revolutionary Party of Haiti, 
who has never participated in the meetings of his colleagues. 
  The U.S. authorities' decision was adopted in an attempt to 
return those parliamentarians who support the military coupists 
and who contributed to the installation of the de facto 
government of Emile Jonassaint to their senses. Senators Bernard 
Sansaricq, Eddy Dupiton, and Dejean Belizaire, who are well 
known for their ultranationalism, reacted on 23 June to the U.S. 
administration's decision to cancel their United States visas.

  [Text] In the Haitian Parliament, the tasks of the eighth 
and final session of the 45th Legislature have still not begun 
despite various attempts by the office of the Chamber of 
Deputies. Several possibilities could explain legislators' 
obvious refusal to meet at this time. It could be the presence 
of the Jonassaint government, not recognized by the assembly of 
deputies. Furthermore, the office presided over by Frantz Robert 
Monde has been subject to increasingly virulent criticism from 
several lawmakers, and various political blocs in the lower 
chamber are now facing serious internal crises. Among them is 
the Parliamentary Bloc-National Front for Change and Democracy 
[BP-FNCD] which just lost about 10 members and regrouped as the 
Social Democratic bloc. Edner Jean met with the president of the 
new political bloc, Deputy Edmond Mirold: 
  [Begin recording] [Mirold] ... Many deputies who are 
now part of the Social Democratic bloc were indeed members of 
FNCD. Most of the deputies from CONACOM [National Congress of 
Democratic Movements] are now part of this bloc, as are many 
other deputies who are not members of CONACOM, but who share the 
same trends and value the same ideas. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Does this division, which is 
established by the formation of this new bloc, not weaken the 
camp defending the return of President Aristide? 
  [Mirold] Of course. Division always creates problems 
and minority groups. We have not changed our stand regarding the 
return of President Aristide. His return is a fundamental 
element for us. It is the basis of our struggle because we stand 
for the return to constitutional order, which cannot be 
accomplished if Aristide's five-year term is not completed.

  [Text] Several workers at the Jamaica Public Service 
Company [JPSCO] are on strike. This action has resulted in the 
crippling of operations at the light and power company. The 
workers are asking for an 80-percent salary increase in the 
first year, and 85 percent in the second. However, management 
says it can only offer 40 percent in year one and 25 percent in 
year two. Janice Budd says as a result of this strike action, 
more than 40 percent of the country is without electricity and 
managers are manning operations. 
  [Begin recording] [Budd] The JPSCO workers gave the minister 
of public utilities one last chance to respond to their demands, 
but when he finally did, the workers were not happy. They stuck 
to their promise and walked off the job. At the Hunt's Bay 
plant, the center of the JPS cooperation, more than 150 workers 
picketed the gate. They say they supply approximately half the 
island's power supply and management cannot keep the plant going 
indefinitely. Workers at all the other JPSCO offices were in 
solidarity with their colleagues at Hunt's Bay. They closed 
their office doors and took to the streets with their placards. 
The workers have several grouses. They want the establishment of 
overtime allowances, a pilot daycare facility, transportation 
home in emergency situations, among other things. 
  [Unidentified striking employee] [passage indistinct] Who 
they care about? [Words indistinct] Consumer? More than they 
care about the employee. [passage indistinct] The consumer 
product [words indistinct]. They do not think about that. 
  [Budd] They say the minister's claim that the company cannot 
offer more money is a lie. They say no company that says it has 
$900 million in the bank can claim inability to pay, especially 
if it has a monopoly on the commodity. 
  [Unidentified employee] We believe that there are ways open 
to the company to pay this amount. There are a number of ways. 
We believe that if the company and their principals, the 
government, considered the situation seriously enough, there is 
a possibility that an improved offer could be made. [passage 
indistinct] 
  [Budd] The workers say they will continue their strike until 
the company's management accept their [word indistinct]. 
Management is running the B-6 and GT-10 units at Hunts Bay and 
keeping emergency units going island-wide until the whole issue 
is resolved, whenever that may be. Until then, the island will 
no doubt feel the effects of their actions. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, workers at the Trinidad and Tobago Electric 
Company sat and looked at the customers what come in for service 
yesterday morning. By yesterday afternoon, the commission was 
warning that workers who refused to perform could be shocked 
into action. The commission was, however, not prepared to say 
precisely the type of shock action it is likely to administer. 
Yesterday's protest is part of a campaign to persuade the 
government against privatization of the utility. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] [Word indistinct] 
customers found themselves caught in the middle of rapidly 
growing objecton to privatization of the commission on the part 
of workers. While [word indistinct] workers sat at their desks 
as usual, they reportedly did little else, refusing to attend to 
customers who eventually trickled out of the Customer Service 
Department, frustrated. Reports are that action taken by the 
workers forced the closure of the South office. Officals of the 
[word indistinct] branch of the OWTU [expansion unknown] denied 
reports that workers forced customers out of the building. 
  [Unidentified OWTU spokesman] [passage indistinct] Okay? We 
will take care of ourselves to [words indistinct] because the 
people upstairs have a pension, too. 
  [Reporter] Workers are continuing protests against 
privatization which they say will deprive them of their 
pensions. They estimate the pension figure to be $540 million. 
They have [words indistinct] far more sinister implicatons of 
the move toward privatization. 
  [OWTU spokesman] [passage indistinct] The minute they stop 
the pension, it means they stop the permanency, too. Up to now, 
we do not know what is going on with the pension which everybody 
is relying on. [Words indistinct] something like 90 percent of 
the workers depend on that. We have people out there with bills 
to pay and this is what they depend on when they reach the age 
of 60; they are able to relax themself and get something and 
help their children or whatever. 
  [Reporter] The workers see this as the return of the white 
devil of colonial days returning labor to slavery. The scene 
today was characterized by empty offices and tight security. 
Service vehicles remained on the compound and the workers wore 
red, carrying red flags, and milling about at the front of the 
building. [Word indistinct] officials have confirmed this 
morning's incident adding that hundred of persons were affected 
by action taken by workers. They add that they have communicated 
to workers that their actions are illegal and that the 
commission will penalize workers if it is not halted by 
Thursday. [Word indistinct] officials say they have assured 
employees that the pensions will not be affected, but that they 
are dissatisfied with the assurance. Workers in Port-of-Spain 
say they intend to march at headquarters tomorrow. [end 
recording] 
  In related news, Barbados' largest public sector union, the 
National Union of Public Workers [NUPW], says it has been 
experiencing problems and more problems in recent times. Andrew 
Lowe takes a look at some of these problems. 
  [Begin recording] [Lowe] The Achilles' heel of the NUPW 
seems 
to be its inability to raise a quorum at important meetings. 
Just two Saturdays ago, the union called its annual general 
meeting which failed to come off because of that "q" word. This 
appears to be a major problem for the union for some time now. 
Commenting on the situation, President Morris said that even 
pressure issues did not seem to attract a crowd. 
  [Morris] I think it is generally speaking, in my view, two 
reasons: one has to do with a general malaise by individuals 
about the running of the organizations where they leave the 
decisions to the leadership. Secondly, from where I sit, I 
believe that our organization needs to move to a delegates' 
conference. 
  [Lowe] Speaking of the time of the failed [word indistinct], 
Mr. Morris said that a new system should be put in place to 
prevent the problem. He said a system in which different 
workers' groups are represented by one or two delegates is a 
system being considered. 
  [Morris] In my view, those people who they be selected by 
their departments -- and this is where the delegate system comes 
in -- where they will be seeking to have elections in the 
various departments for delegates on a proportional basis to be 
sent to represent the interests, and therefore, what can happen 
is conceivably the union can have 500 or 600 delegates and a 
quorum of those will be some amount, but I believe that that 
will ensure a lot more. 
  [Lowe] But finding a quorum is not the only [word 
indistinct] 
situation the union has been faced with recently. Try electing a 
new executive for good measure. The union tried that last 
Wednesday. The result? Chaos. Election officials discovered 
ballot tampering with a number of votes for the presidency. The 
election was eventually declared null and void following a 
heated meeting Saturday. The war of words spilled over from the 
meeting. [end recording]

  [Text] President Hafiz al-Asad received Haydar Abu-Bakr 
al-'Attas, former Yemeni prime minister and envoy of 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid, secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party, 
accompanied by 'Abd-al-Qawi Makkawi and Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz 
al-Dali, at 1130 today. Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' attended 
the meeting. 
  Talks dealt with the situation in Yemen and its regrettable 
developments, as well as the current efforts to address it. The 
talks also dealt with the impact of this situation on sisterly 
Yemen and its future as well as on the pan-Arab interest of the 
Arab nation. 
  The president emphasized to the Yemeni delegation that Syria 
is concerned about what is taking place in Yemen and is 
anxiously following the bloody developments that replaced 
brotherly dialogue in addressing differences. The president 
said fighting is not in the interest of the fraternal Yemeni 
people, the Arab nation, or the unionist aspirations of the Arab 
masses. The president said Syria renews its appeal to the 
Yemeni brothers to stop resorting to arms and blood, apply 
logic, observe national and pan-Arab interests, and return to 
constructive brotherly dialogue out of concern for Yemen and its 
unity -- land and people. 
  The Yemeni delegation expressed its appreciation for Syria's 
pan-Arab position. 
  Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas and his delegation left Damascus 
this evening following a two-day visit. Foreign Minister Faruq 
al-Shar' saw them off at Damascus International Airport. 
  In a statement to the Syrian Arab News Agency, al-'Attas 
said: Today, we were honored to be received by President Hafiz 
al-Asad. We were pleased by the positive stand of sisterly Syria 
and by the accurate analysis of the current situation in Yemen. 
Viewpoints were completely identical on the danger posed by the 
continuation of war in Yemen. This war threatens Yemen as well 
as the Arab nation and the region with numerous dangers. 
Therefore, we agreed to exert efforts and work together to stop 
the war and deal with all differences peacefully. 
  Asked about halting fighting and preserving Yemeni unity, he 
said: This is what we are working for. I think the mission on 
which we have to work, along with brothers in Syria and all 
brothers and friends, is that of stopping the war. By stopping 
the war, we can deal with all issues and preserve what remains 
of Yemen and safeguard its unionist march. 
  Responding to a question on the presence of contacts between 
Aden and Sanaa, he said: There are no contacts at present, 
except for those held through brothers and friends and the Arab 
League. 
  Al-'Attas described his visit to Damascus by saying: It was 
a visit we highly value because I sensed a positive stand of 
solidarity and an accurate analysis of the situation in our 
country as a result of the recently-declared war. 
  Al-'Attas welcomed all mediation and efforts to stop the war 
and avert further Yemeni losses and address the situation 
peacefully. He said: We welcomed the Egyptian mediation and the 
Egyptian-Emirian mediation and we welcome every mediation.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: Yitzhaq Rabin, the head of the Israeli 
government, has acknowledged the wide gap between the Israeli 
and Syrian positions on the peace process. Shim'on Peres, the 
Israeli foreign minister, said earlier in Washington that 
Syria's terms for negotiations are unacceptable and that it 
wants to wrest great concessions from Israel, especially with 
regard to full withdrawal from the Golan. 
  It seems Israeli officials continue to block and hinder 
prospects for achieving a real breakthrough in the peace process 
based on the Security Council resolutions and the land-for-peace 
principle. 
  What Peres terms great concessions is an outright fallacy. 
The Golan has been Syrian territory since time immemorial. It 
is an indivisible part of Syria. Therefore, Israel's withdrawal 
amounts to nothing more than a correction of an abnormal 
situation and the end of an aggression that has continued since 
1967. 
  Security Council resolutions have asked Israel to pull its 
troops out and not to change the identity of the Golan and the 
other occupied territories. The U.S. peace initiative was 
launched, in the first place, on the basis of Resolutions 242 
and 338 and the land-for-peace principle, as well as the need to 
achieve a just and comprehensive settlement on all fronts of the 
conflict. 
  The ABC's of justice suggest that occupation should be 
removed; usurped territory should be returned to its owners; and 
that Israel should submit to UN law and stop pursuing the law of 
the jungle. Humanity is preparing to enter the 21st Century. 
Occupation has been removed from all over the Earth. All 
nations have attained their freedom and independence. It is 
illogical that Israel should stay above international law, 
practicing a policy of occupation and terrorism and deeming the 
invasion of others' territories a legitimate right and the 
displacement of the residents of those territories a fact of 
life. 
  Israel's claim will remain worthless until this claim is 
translated into actual, concrete stands toward peace. Since 
1948, the rulers of Israel have been crying out for peace and at 
the same time igniting wars and carrying out attacks in the name 
of working to achieve peace. But, when the Arabs responded to 
the first serious U.S. initiative, the Israeli rulers' peaceful 
claims turned into obstacles and hindrances in the way of the 
progress of the peace process. 
  Syria, along with Lebanon and Jordan, have proposed full 
peace in return for full withdrawal. However, the Israeli 
rulers rejected outright the principle of full withdrawal and 
hinted at the possibility of partial withdrawals in return for a 
series of impossible conditions and restrictions. In Lebanon's 
case, for example, the Israeli rulers have escalated their 
brutal land, air, and sea attacks against Lebanon, because 
Lebanon adheres to the implementation of Security Council 
Resolution 425. They deemed their message to Lebanon a message 
to all Arabs who ask for the withdrawal of the occupying Israeli 
forces to the 4 June 1967 lines. 
  The rulers of Israel have also rejected a comprehensive 
withdrawal from the Golan under fabricated pretexts. They 
deliberately foiled any prospect for real progress on the 
Syrian-Israeli track. In fact, Rabin has gone as far as making 
a commitment to hold a public referendum on the Golan, as if 
Israel is above international and UN law and can simply occupy 
and annex the land of others while the owners of the land are 
not allowed to claim it or to defend its identity, culture, and 
history. 
  These Israeli practices, in the Golan, southern Lebanon, and 
the Palestinian arena, clearly confirm that Israel does not want 
peace and that it has never abandoned its expansionist and 
aggressive schemes. It is no coincidence at all that the 
Government of Israel has threatened to occupy the Gaza Strip and 
Jericho once again if the Palestinian self-rule authorities do 
not abide by Israel's instructions. 
  Peace in the eyes of the entire world means establishing 
justice and right and ending occupation, injustice, oppression, 
and terrorism. In Israel's book, however, peace is a cheap deal 
that guarantees that Israel will swallow as much as it can of 
others' territories that it has occupied by force, deception, 
and trickery. 
  It is natural for Syria and the other Arab parties to reject 
such aggressive proposals and adhere to the restoration of all 
their occupied territories and to assert international law in 
the region. 
  The Israelis are greatly mistaken if they think their 
maneuvers and tactics, which have exceeded all limits, will make 
the Arabs abandon their territories and rights. Syria said 
yesterday -- and it reiterates today and will reiterate tomorrow 
-- that there can be no relinquishment of any single iota of the 
soil of the Golan and that peace depends on the departure of the 
last Israeli soldier from the Golan and the establishment of a 
just and comprehensive solution in the region.

  [Text] Damascus, 29 May (SANA) -- The newspaper AL-BA'TH 
has called on the international community to take a firm and 
quick position on Israel's continued attacks and piracy against 
Lebanese territory. 
  In a commentary today, the paper adds that these attacks 
pose 
grave threats to the region in general and to the Middle East 
peace process in particular. Israel's impudence and arrogance 
are the result of the direct political support provided by the 
United States at the Security Council, the paper notes. 
  AL-BA'TH rejects the feeble justifications made by 
Washington 
and other states supporting Israel at the Security Council to 
explain their positions on the Israeli crimes. The paper says 
these justifications try to hold the national resistance 
responsible for Israeli practices. It emphasizes that 
resistance is a legitimate and sacred right for anyone subjected 
to aggression and injustice. 
  Concluding, the paper says: The deteriorating situation in 
southern Lebanon is an alarm that requires a swift international 
move to save both southern Lebanon and the peace process, which 
is facing a difficult impasse.

  [Text] During its meeting in Tunis last night, which lasted 
until late this morning, the Palestinian National Authority 
Council approved its draft political program, which emphasizes 
the end of occupation, particularly in the [West] Bank and the 
[Gaza] Strip. 
  A responsible Palestinian source said that the program also 
emphasizes the PLO's stand on the problem of Jerusalem, which is 
part of the territories that were occupied in 1967, and that the 
Council reiterates the National Authority's abidance by the 
resolutions of international legitimacy, specifically 
Resolutions 242 and 338. The source added that the program also 
stipulates the formation by the PLO Executive Committee of the 
National Authority and its institutions and that the PLO is the 
basic reference for the National Authority Council and the 
authority's institutions. 
  The Palestinian National Authority Council decided to take 
the constitutional oath before brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 
'Arafat], president of the state of Palestine, in the homeland 
following the return and after brother Abu-'Ammar is sworn in as 
chairman of the Council before brother Abu-al-Adib, Salim 
al-Za'nun, acting speaker of the Palestine National Council.

  [Text] Tunis, 28 May (MENA) -- The PLO Executive Committee, 
meeting under the chairmanship of Yasir 'Arafat, today approved 
the Palestinian National Authority's program of action for the 
coming stage. 
  Executive Committee member Samir Ghawshah said after the 
meeting that the Committee introduced some amendments to the 
program that the Palestinian National Authority Council had 
discussed and approved last night. Ghawshah added that this is 
an interim program that will be used until general elections are 
held in the West Bank and Gaza. 
  He declared that the program demonstrates that the National 
Authority will carry out its tasks through the concerned 
departments in a spirit of national commitment and will rely on 
Palestinian experts in various fields. 
  Ghawshah announced that the Palestinian National Authority 
is 
committed to all the agreements, treaties, and charters signed 
by the PLO and that it will seek to implement the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, "the Gaza-Jericho 
Agreement," as a first step toward the restoration of the 
Palestinian people's legitimate rights. 
  He said the program approved today emphasizes Palestine's 
Arabness and the National Authority's desire to nurture close 
ties with the Arab countries. He noted that the program also 
stresses the National Authority's adherence to UN resolutions, 
particularly Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. 
  [Cairo MENA in Arabic at 1810 GMT on 28 May reports: "The 
Palestinian National Authority Council today appointed Dr. 
'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Hajj Ahmad a member of the Council and minister 
of transport and communications. He is the 15th minister 
named."] 
  [The MENA report continues: "Faysal al-Husayni and Munib 
al-Masri remain members of the Palestinian National Authority 
Council, but without portfolios. Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi has refused 
to be a member of the Council even though 'Arafat offered her 
the information portfolio. Sari Nusaybah has so far neither 
accepted nor declined 'Arafat's selection of him as a National 
Authority Council member. Faysal al-Husayni had formerly 
announced that he wished to devote his time to the Jerusalem 
issue and did not want to assume a ministerial post."]

  [Excerpt] Tunis, 29 May (MENA) -- The Palestinian National 
Authority Council last night wound up three days of meetings 
under Council Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, during which it appointed 
ministers for the National Authority and approved the 
Authority's program for the coming period. 
  Dr. Samir Ghawshah, council member and minister of labor and 
workers, said in the next few days 'Arafat will hold 
consultations with Palestinian groups to complete the formation 
of the council by appointing five more members. Thus, the 
members of the council will total 25, including 'Arafat. 
  Dr. Ghawshah said 'Arafat will hold consultations with the 
various Palestinian forces to complete the appointment of 
ministers from among the council members. Fifteen ministers 
were appointed yesterday. Seven other ministries remain vacant, 
including the Interior Ministry, which will be taken over by 
'Arafat himself so he can directly supervise the Palestinian 
police and security forces. The Information Ministry remains 
vacant after Hanan 'Ashrawi, former spokeswoman of the 
Palestinian negotiating delegations, declined to take up that 
post. [passage omitted]

  Palestinian Authority is established today on the liberated 
Palestinian soil in the Gaza Strip and Jericho area, declaring 
the end of long years of suffering and pain experienced by the 
Palestinian people as a result of occupation and displacement 
and long years of coercion inside the homeland and alienation in 
exile. Despite occupation and displacement, this great people 
have not surrendered or relinquished their rights. They 
resisted and struggled one generation after another for their 
freedom, independence, and repatriation to their homeland. They 
offered thousands of martyrs such as ['Izz-al-Din] al-Qassam, 
Hasan Salamah, and the prince of martyrs Abu-Jihad [Khalil 
al-Wazir], and thousands of prisoners and wounded to regain 
their usurped rights. Throughout the years of struggle, this 
people have adhered to their national unity under occupation and 
in the diaspora. 
  This struggle and its various tools -- armed struggle, 
political struggle, and brave intifadah -- as well as this firm 
national unity constituted the real lever to regain the people's 
rights. This struggle led to recognizing our people, their 
leadership, and political framework, the PLO, the representative 
of the Palestinian people, whose cause has become the cause of 
the age. Consequently, world countries and organizations 
recognized the legitimacy of this people's struggle and right to 
independence and repatriation. 
  Our people have always believed in regaining their rights 
through a just peace that can achieve security and peace for all 
people in the region. In 1939, a nonsectarian democratic state 
plan was proposed; in 1974, a independent Palestinian state plan 
was proposed; and the Palestinian peace plan was presented on 15 
November 1988. However, others rejected the participation of 
our people and their legitimate representative. 
  When the opportunity arose, our people and their leadership 
did not hesitate to join the Madrid peace process that produced 
the principles signed in Washington 13 September, 1993. Now that 
the Gaza-Jericho agreement -- the first executive agreement of 
the Declaration of Principles -- has been signed, the first step 
toward the implementation of the peace project begins by 
implementing the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho and 
the establishment of the Palestinian authority on this dear part 
of Palestine. We thus confirm the return of Palestine to the 
political map of our region and the world and the beginning of 
the process of regaining the rights of the Palestinian people on 
their land. 
  The Palestinian authority will work toward the step-by-step 
realization of the legitimate Palestinian aims -- independence, 
freedom, equality, and repatriation -- through negotiation and 
the peace process. 
  This will be realized through a commitment to the full 
implementation of the Gaza-Jericho accord and its development by 
entering the second phase as quickly as possible, beginning by 
settling what has not been decided in the agreement regarding 
the Jericho area and some areas of the Gaza Strip and by the 
early empowerment of the Palestinian Authority on the 
Palestinian territory in the West bank and then by convening the 
four-side committee in order to open the door for the return of 
those who were displaced after June, 1967 and for completing the 
interim period agreement that would bring about a total Israeli 
withdrawal from all the cities, villages, and camps of the West 
Bank, and electing the legislative council, and finally opening 
negotiations on the final status within the shortest possible 
period, as called for by the Declaration of Principles. 
  Our stand at the latest negotiations was absolutely clear. 
For us, these negotiations were the right way to bring about 
the full withdrawal from the territories conquered by Israel in 
1967, the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, 
with Jerusalem as its capital, and the termination of settlement 
building in the West Bank and Gaza as it was ended in Egypt's 
Sinai in implementation of UN resolutions, especially 
Resolutions 242 and 338, and to find a comprehensive and just 
solution to the Palestinian refugee problem in accordance with 
UN Resolution 194. 
  Until all that is accomplished through negotiation and in 
phases, we stick to the territorial integrity of the Gaza Strip 
and the West Bank. We will also not allow any tampering with 
the status of the integrity of this Palestinian territory. We 
will also reject any interpretation of the postponement of the 
final status of Jerusalem that would allow the occupation 
authorities to change the physical or demographic status through 
illegal settlement activities or the continuing development and 
isolation of the Arab city of Jerusalem and its people. We 
emphasize the Arab and Palestinian identity of Jerusalem as an 
integral part of the West Bank in line with UN resolutions and 
the stands of all the nations of the world that refuse to 
recognize the illegal annexation of Jerusalem by the state of 
Israel. 
  The Palestinian authority will work to realize that 
principle 
in all its work plans, until the final status of Jerusalem is 
negotiated in the coming stage. 
  We understand the letter and spirit of the Declaration of 
Principles agreement and the Gaza-Jericho agreement in light of 
the Israeli policy known to us; namely, that settlement activity 
is to be frozen during the interim period and that settlers will 
not be permitted to muscle their way into Palestinian land 
carrying their weapons to duplicate the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre 
and other such atrocities. We also understand settlement 
activity founded on occupation and the confiscation of land to 
be a racist phenomenon that will be phased out ahead of its 
complete elimination through peaceful means. 
  We understand clearly that the agreement that has been 
signed creates new conditions in which the Israeli occupation 
will never return to our liberated land. We also understand 
that this is an irreversible march and that this march should 
continue to move forward. 
  We also understand the agreement to be the road to real 
peace 
between the Palestinian and Israeli peoples, and to full 
security for both peoples. It is also the means for realizing 
justice, prosperity, and welfare for all countries of the 
region, and is a prelude to Israeli withdrawal from all occupied 
Arab territories, and to a just and comprehensive Arab-Israeli 
peace on all fronts. 
  As we ask the Israeli Government to commit itself to 
continue 
its implementation of the agreement as soon as possible and to 
go ahead in its withdrawal and dismantling of settlements, we 
are also fully committed to what the PLO -- the representative 
of all of the Palestinian people -- committed itself in this 
agreement, the Declaration of Principles, the messages of mutual 
recognition between the PLO and Israel, and all commitments 
emanating from these agreements. We are also committed to 
anything that achieves peace and security for the Palestinian 
and Israeli people, and to resolving all our current and future 
conflicts through peaceful means as long as Israel is committed 
to this. 
  We understand this agreement also as a tool to change the 
situation of our people from occupation, constant oppression, 
injustice, and impoverishment to quick economic development, 
prosperity, dignity, and justice for all Palestinian citizens, 
and to an effective and honest government, and safeguarding 
their human rights. 
  In spite of all our expectations of a brilliant future for 
our people, we are aware of the great responsibility we 
shoulder. This agreement is a transitional and partial 
agreement, and is a limited initial step that does not at all 
represent the peak of our ambitions and aspirations of our 
people. The implementation of this agreement will face several 
difficulties. The occupation ruled militant Gaza Strip for 27 
years, and left it in a very difficult situation. It has 
usurped land, water, and resources. It has destroyed its 
economy, establishments, and facilities. The Palestinian 
Authority will shoulder the responsibility in a difficult Arab 
and international situation in which aid diminished and the 
burden increased. 
  The building of the Palestinian Authority is a laborious 
endeavor. We should depend only on ourselves and the creative 
capabilities of our people and their readiness to offer endless 
sacrifices. We should remind that construction after struggle 
requires sacrifices and efforts, and that dangers facing our 
march require the participation of all sons of our people in 
shouldering the responsibility and leading the Palestinian ship 
to safe shores. This requires further national unity, rallying 
behind the PLO, and ensuring the participation of the 
Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza, and abroad regardless of 
their current nationalities or present location. 
  The Palestinian Authority is aware that it should be a model 
in its actions, based on democratic principles, the rule of law, 
respect for rights and basic liberties, including the freedom to 
worship, political and ideological pluralism, and equality 
between man and woman. 
  The Palestinian Authority should follow an open and 
responsible system, and carry out its task under popular 
supervision. It should commit itself to the principle of 
effective participation, mobilization of qualified cadres, 
building of establishments, human development based on an 
integrated system that guarantees honesty, efficiency and work 
development. 
  Our confidence in our people is limitless and is the 
foundation on which the Palestine of tomorrow will be built. 
Our people can give to their homeland Palestine under freedom 
and independence the same amount of effective contribution in 
construction and development they have given, together with 
their Arab brothers, in all countries. 
  The Palestinian Authority also stresses the Arab and 
Palestinian identity of our people in the Galilee, the Triangle, 
and the Negev. It views their steadfastness on their land and 
insistence on their right to citizenship and full equity and 
adherence to the homeland a bridge that links them to their 
people under the canopy of peace which we are now starting to 
implement between Palestine and Israel. 
  Our Palestinian people will never forget the virtuous 
martyrs 
of the Arab nation who sacrificed their lives for the sake of 
Palestine. Nor will it forget the suffering of the neighboring 
Arab states that resulted from the Israeli occupation and the 
Arab nation's fostering of Palestine and its people during their 
diaspora and suffering under occupation. 
  The Palestinian Authority underlines its commitment to the 
Arab nature of Palestine and its affiliation to the Arab nation, 
the Arab-Islamic culture, and the varied heritage of the 
heavenly messages, which consider Palestine a sacred land. It 
pledges to protect the freedom of worship and the exercise of 
faith and religious rites for all without any discrimination. 
  The new Palestine under the Palestinian Authority will 
proceed from its civilization, religious, and cultural roots. 
It will be open to this world and committed to its charters, 
chief of which are the UN Charter, the Arab League Charter, and 
the conventions on human rights. 
  As long as occupation remains on part of our territory, the 
Geneva Conventions and the Hague Treaty should apply since they 
are the tools of the international law to protect the peoples 
under occupation. The international legitimacy, and 
particularly UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, will 
remain the basis for all future negotiations. 
  The special relations between Palestine and the neighboring 
Arab states, particularly Jordan and Egypt, require a special 
policy which will be translated by the Palestinian Authority 
into political and economic cooperation agreements to embody and 
strengthen these special relations. 
  In implementation of this declared policy, the Palestinian 
Authority is hereby declaring to the masses of our Palestinian 
people its working program for the future phase to win their 
support, backing, and participation in implementing these 
objectives in this important phase of our people's life.

  [Text] Tunis, 28 May (MENA) -- Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi, former 
spokeswoman of the Palestinian negotiating delegation, has 
stressed that she will not join the Palestinian National 
Authority Council, which will administer self-rule in Gaza and 
Jericho. 
  In remarks to the MENA correspondent in Tunis, Dr. 'Ashrawi 
said that she will not accept any position in the National 
Authority, although Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat has 
picked her up to be a member of the Council and offered her the 
information portfolio. She explained that this is because she 
has obligations to an independent Palestinian body working for 
Palestinian citizens' rights, which chose her to be its chairman. 
  Dr. 'Ashrawi pointed out that despite her refusal to join 
the 
Council, she attended meetings held by the Council in the past 
two days because she had been invited to them. She also wanted 
to participate in drafting the Palestinian National Authority's 
program so that it would be adequate, comprehensive, democratic, 
just, and allow for accountability to and revision by the 
legislative bodies, she added. She hoped that all articles of 
the Palestinian National Authority's program would be 
implemented and adhered to by every one.

<F P=106> [Report by Muhammad Kurayshan from Tunis] </F>
  [Text] At a meeting this afternoon in Tunis, the PLO 
Executive Committee approved a program for the National 
Authority that will run the self-rule areas. The PLO Executive 
Committee is the party to which this authority reports. 
However, according to a Palestinian official, it is not 
expected that the Executive Committee will be consulted on every 
small and significant affair as long as operations go on 
according to the program that was endorsed. 
  A new name was added today to the 14 ministerial portfolios 
announced at a late hour yesterday evening. The new figure is 
Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Hajj Ahmad, who was assigned the portfolio 
of transportation and communications. 
  The final decision of Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi, who was offered 
the 
portfolio of information, is not known yet. Dr. Samir Ghawshah, 
member of the Executive Committee and the National Authority, 
said the final reply of Mrs. 'Ashrawi may be given after her 
return to Jerusalem. 
  Abu-Nidal Musallami, member of the Central Committee of the 
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, who is currently 
in Tunisia, denied categorically to us that it is possible for 
him to join the National Authority, as was rumored here in the 
past two days. He said this news was baseless. 
  This evening's session of the National Authority is expected 
to be the last. This session is expected to distribute the rest 
of the ministerial portfolios, which are 22, and to form the 
Authority, in which 20 out of 24 members, under 'Arafat's 
leadership, have been appointed so far.

  Discussions on filling the other portfolios is continuing, 
including the Ministry of the Liberated and Injured Affairs [as 
heard], Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, Information 
Ministry, Ministry of Public Works, Ministry of Religious 
Affairs, Environment Ministry, and Interior Ministry. 
Appointments to these posts have not been settled yet and 
deliberations will continue for several days. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Are there any obstacles to the appointment 
of 
the remaining ministers? 
  ['Urayqat] It is not really a question of obstacles. We are 
keeping two issues in mind. First, we are trying to represent 
the largest possible sector of our people in the National 
Authority. Contacts are taking place on several levels for this 
purpose. We hope that these contacts will produce a broad 
representation of the political movements in the National 
Authority. The second issue is that what we are doing now is 
not as easy as in other countries. We are starting from square 
one. We are facing huge challenges and difficulties, including 
the devastated infrastructure left by the Israeli occupation in 
Jericho and the Gaza Strip and the ruined infrastructure we are 
expecting to take over when the Israelis evacuate the other 
areas. The gaps found in the Palestinian-Israeli Agreement 
present further difficulties. The challenges and 
responsibilities are great. This is why we are making further 
contacts. We need more time so we can include the broadest 
possible representation in the National Authority while keeping 
in mind that the people filling the posts must have the 
necessary qualifications. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] What criteria were used in selecting the 
Palestinian National Authority's ministers? 
  ['Urayqat] There were several criteria. We had to keep in 
mind the mingling of Palestinians living abroad with those 
living inside. As you will notice, several PLO Executive 
Committee members and people from other PLO institutions have 
been given portfolios. We believed in the importance of 
qualifications and experience but also in the appointees' 
patriotic commitment and their willingness to accept the 
challenges. We are passing through an interim phase 
unprecedented in modern times. Above all, we must preserve the 
Palestinian people's unity at this stage, regardless of where 
they live. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Dr. 'Urayqat, in this interim period you 
are certainly facing immense difficulties that, as you say, are 
a product of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory. 
What are your working plans for the future? 
  ['Urayqat] As you know, our work began immediately after the 
occupation troops left. Still, no matter how fast we act, we 
will remain somewhat behind. We must remember that normal 
development in the occupied Palestinian territories was 
effectively halted in 1967. No matter how fast we work and 
implement our programs, we will remain a little behind because 
we have a lot to do. We have already done something in the 
short time that has passed since the end of the occupation of 
Gaza and Jericho. All government departments are now using 
documents and letterheads bearing the Palestinian National 
Authority's stamp. New departments have been established. Some 
temporary appointments have been made in all the areas. Now 
that the portfolios have been distributed, every ministry will 
build up its organizational structure and draw up plans and 
projects for the first 100 days. We must work quickly now. We 
want to finish our present work in the next few hours, not days. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Dr. 'Urayqat, Israel consistently casts 
doubt 
on the Palestinian National Authority's actual ability to 
govern. Israel is saying that the Palestinians were always ruled 
by others and casts doubt on their ability to govern themselves. 
  ['Urayqat] We are really facing two types of Israeli 
campaigns. First, media campaigns trying to undermine our 
efforts -- we have been expecting this -- and second, Israeli 
actions that violate the clauses of the agreement or create 
faits accomplis as in Jerusalem and the settlements. They are 
expanding the existing settlements. I believe that what we are 
doing is an experiment that involves factors of success and 
failure. I can definitely say that if Israel continues its 
current actions and fails to alter its occupier attitude to a 
neighborly attitude that involves respecting an adjacent nation 
that the experiment will fail. So far we have heard only 
accusations and incitements from the Israeli officials. They 
are also carrying out conspicuous, blatant violations of the 
agreement. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Dr. 'Urayqat, we wish success for the 
Palestinian National Authority. We hope that the fraternal 
Palestinian people will fulfill their aspirations in the next 
stage, now that they have begun to restore their national 
rights. Thank you very much. 
  ['Urayqat] You are welcome. I would like to say one last 
word. The current stage is one of planting, not reaping. It is 
a time to tighten our belts. It is a small step on a long 
route. We hope, however, that in the next few years our efforts 
and struggles will be crowned by the establishment of an 
independent state. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] God willing. 
  ['Urayqat] God willing. Thank you.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Furayh Abu-Middayn, member of the </F>
Palestinian National Authority and head of the justice 
portfolio, in Tunis, by 'Umar Zaydani in the studio; date not 
given; from the "With the Midday Events" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Zaydani] Furayh Abu-Middayn, justice minister in 
the Palestinian National Authority: Would you please explain 
the significance of the appointments announced in Tunis 
yesterday? 
  [Abu-Middayn] The appointments that have taken place over 
the 
past 48 hours were aimed at meeting the requirements of 
establishing ministries capable of serving the people in the 
West Bank in general and in Gaza in particular. There are many 
outstanding issues, and there is also an administrative, legal, 
and constitutional vacuum in the occupied territories. 
Therefore, the government was formed quickly. Even the 
oath-taking ceremony was postponed so that it can be held on 
part of the Palestinian land. I believe it will take place in 
Jericho next month. These appointments, as you know, occurred 
before the arrival of financial aid. The European countries, as 
well as other countries, should begin to pump money. Therefore, 
there should be a ministerial apparatus capable of acting 
immediately to run daily affairs. As you know, there are crises 
in the areas of unemployment, financing, and supply. So, what 
took place was an attempt to fill the vacuum that has resulted 
from the withdrawal and then to keep the old administrative 
apparatus. But there should be officials with political weight 
who refer to the PLO in everything. In brief this is what took 
place. 
  [Zaydani] When will the members of the Palestinian National 
Authority arrive in Gaza and Jericho? 
  [Abu-Middayn] Most probably they will arrive within a week. 
Their return was approved, and I believe they will arrive within 
a week. There are many problems, and people are allowed to go 
to the inside [self-rule area]. I believe there is a logistical 
problem in Jericho, and offices are not ready. As for Gaza, 
there are places and offices, and it can absorb all the brothers 
coming from outside. 
  [Zaydani] Furayh Abu-Middayn, why has Yasir 'Arafat not so 
far succeeded in appointing all the members of the Palestinian 
National Authority? 
  [Abu-Middayn] Consultations with some political sides are 
underway. Although the issue is not a geographical one, there 
are three or four people from the Gaza Strip to be named. 
Intensive consultations are underway, and I believe that the 
most important ministries have been named. We will give 
ourselves time to appoint the remaining five or six ministers 
from the [occupied territories]. It is more of a technical than 
political problem. 
  [Zaydani] Furayh Abu-Middayn, there is much criticism in 
Israel. You are talking about ministries and the formation of a 
government. There is an agreement on a self-rule in 
Gaza-Jericho First, but you are adopting a political program or 
a constitution indicating the establishment of almost an 
independent Palestinian State with Jerusalem as its capital. 
  [Abu-Middayn] These are future ambitions. We are talking and 
acting in accordance with the Cairo and Oslo accords. Every one 
knows this reality. But the Palestinian people have ambitions 
for which they have offered great sacrifices. These things that 
annoy Israel are merely abstract and future things. However, we 
are committed to every detail in these accords. The Palestinian 
people's future thoughts, however, should not be confiscated. 
There is an intention to establish a state, and there is an 
intention to establish a confederation with Jordan. There are 
many things we should think about from now on. We want to 
straighten matters out. The State of Israel itself has no 
constitution and does not recognize fixed borders. Why is 
Israel not criticized? The absence of a constitution in Israel 
is a source of fear for the Palestinian side because borders are 
not defined. These matters should not upset Israel, and I do 
not believe that Israel has fears more than necessary. 
  [Zaydani] Furayh Abu-Middayn, you are now in Tunis. Israel 
has warned the PLO against establishing institutions for the 
self-rule in East Jerusalem and conducting activities from 
Orient House, the Economic Planning Council, and the Palestinian 
Statistics Center. Is the PLO trying to create a fait accompli 
in East Jerusalem? 
  [Abu-Middayn] It is Israel which is trying to impose a fait 
accompli. If Israel had frozen settlement in East Jerusalem, 
there would have been no problem with the Palestinian side. 
Jerusalem is a very sensitive issue, and Israel is not 
committed to accords on freezing settlements. There has been a 
pledge since President Bush's era that settlement activity would 
be frozen. At that time, Israel obtained a loan guarantee of 
$10 billion as support for Israel's economy. It is Israel which 
makes changes on the ground. There are 150,000 Palestinian 
citizens in East Jerusalem. These people have rights and the 
PLO has the right to think seriously about them and to keep them 
in the political and geographical map. Meanwhile, Israel 
expands. It extends Jerusalem northward, eastward, and 
southward. Israel should commit itself. If Israel had 
announced halting or freezing settlements, there would not have 
been all this trouble. Rather, this is self-defense than 
provoking the Israeli side. 
  [Zaydani] Furayh Abu-Middayn, justice minister in the 
Palestinian National Authority. Thank you very much. 
  [Abu-Middayn] You are welcome.

<F P=106> [Report by Gaza Strip correspondent 'Amira Hess] </F>
  [Text] The Palestinian self-rule appointments were made 
without first establishing appropriate mechanisms necessary for 
its success. This observation was made yesterday by Hisham 
'Abd-al-Razzaq, a senior Fatah official in the Gaza Strip. "I 
pity the council members, who are forced to keep promises they 
are unable to keep." 'Abd-al-Razzaq was chiefly referring to 
the fact that Western countries had pledged donations and loans 
to the Palestinians, but have so far failed to make any 
payments. "The world only cares when it sees blood. It acts 
only when faced with tragic situations. Not only will the 
agreement fail, it will become a major atomic bomb if the 
economic situation in Gaza does not improve." 
  'Abd-al-Razzaq said the council's performance and the 
success 
of the Gaza-Jericho First agreement depended on three conditions: 
  -- The Israeli labor market must be open to all Palestinians 
(and not merely to the 23,000 who had work permits prior to 
February). 
  -- Donation funds should start arriving at once, and the 
positions and tasks in the council and the Palestinian 
self-rule's institutions should be properly distributed. 
  -- "All those who gave all they could and devoted themselves 
to the Palestinian struggle should be taken into account" when 
appointments are made. 
  A month ago 'Abd-al-Razzaq, who spent about 20 years in 
prison, was mentioned as a possible appointment to the Autonomy 
Council; this fact was received with great satisfaction in Gaza. 
  "I learned about my alleged appointment from the media, and 
personally, I would prefer not to take on this thankless job," 
he told HA'ARETZ yesterday. 
  "But the noninclusion of people who were devoted to the 
struggle is liable to lead to dire consequence." 'Abd-al-Razzaq 
went on: "When a man is bitter, when he sees no reward to his 
deeds and sacrifice, he will not settle for personal 
disappointment. We are talking here about people who devoted 
their lives to the struggle. These people's disappointment will 
have a direct impact on the street." 
  'Abd-al-Razzaq did not answer our question on whether he and 
his associates have apprised PLO-Tunis of the importance of 
incorporating field activists in the council. "It would be 
better for them to reach this conclusion on their own. I cannot 
believe they do not understand it," he said. 
  A delegation of about 20 Israeli Arabs, including Dr. Ahmad 
al-Tibi, visited Gaza yesterday. They met with Nasr Yusuf, the 
General Security commander, in his office situated in what was 
the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] division building until two 
weeks ago. Yusuf told the visitors: "We cannot say we are 
independent yet, but this is our first step to independence." 
He called for stronger ties between the two parts of the 
Palestinian people -- "those outside (in the territories) and 
inside (in Israel)." 
  Dr. al-Tibi echoed the statement that the agreement was the 
fist step toward full independence, adding that "we will always 
say that Jerusalem is the capital of the Palestinian state."

  [Text] Palestinian negotiator and East Jerusalem lawyer 
Ziyad Abu-Zayyad says that Palestinians naturally view East 
Jerusalem as the capital of the state they hope to establish. 
  [Begin recording] [Abu-Zayyad] East Jerusalem is a symbol 
of the Palestinian nationality, of the Arab dignity, and of the 
Islamic belief and faith. And, of course, it is viewed by us as 
our future capital. 
  [Correspondent Mark Weiss] Can you confirm that the PLO is 
engaged in efforts to continue moving national institutions to 
East Jerusalem? 
  [Abu-Zayyad] Well, I think that the issue of Jerusalem is 
supposed to be on the negotiating table in the second phase of 
the negotiations, and I believe that this thing will be 
discussed through negotiations. I don't think that the PLO will 
move its offices to Jerusalem without negotiations and without 
coordinating with the other side because at the end we need to 
find a solution for Jerusalem which will be for the satisfaction 
of all parties. 
  [Weiss] Israeli leaders, at the moment at least, insist that 
Jerusalem will remain the united capital of Israel. Do you 
believe Israel will eventually compromise on this issue? 
  [Abu-Zayyad] Well, of course yes. Of course I do, because 
anyone who wants peace he knows deep in his heart that he cannot 
have peace and have Jerusalem only under the Israeli 
sovereignty. [end recording]

  [Text] The Palestinians today decided to increase their 
political activity in East Jerusalem as the peace process 
advances. This is their reaction to Israel's expected moves. 
Faysal al-Husayni, who holds the Jerusalem portfolio in the 
Palestinian Authority, declared that the battle over Jerusalem 
has started. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Amir] Faysal al-Husayni, the Palestinian 
Authority minister in charge of Jerusalem, held a news 
conference at Orient House a short time ago and declared that 
the battle over Jerusalem has started. He emphasized that in 
his opinion Israel started this battle in an attempt to limit 
Palestinian political activity in Orient House and other 
Palestinian institutions in the city: 
  [Al-Husayni, in English] We can say that while we are 
fighting a battle to end the isolation of Jerusalem from the 
other part of the occupied territories, I believe the Israelis 
are trying to open a new fight and a new battle against us, so 
they hope that the world and we will forget about the matter of 
the closure of Jerusalem and we will fight only for our 
existence and the existence of our institutions in Jerusalem. 
  [Amir, translates the above and continues] Al-Husayni said 
that while the Palestinians are trying to struggle against the 
isolation of Jerusalem from other areas in the territories -- 
referring to the ongoing closure on the city -- Israel is trying 
to open a new battle against us in order to make the world and 
us forget the closure on Jerusalem and limit our struggle to the 
existence of our institutions in Jerusalem. 
  Al-Husayni noted that the political activity in East 
Jerusalem preceded the Oslo agreement, and that it drew its 
strength from the peace process rather than the interim 
agreement. He emphasized, therefore, that the Palestinians will 
open more political institutions in East Jerusalem as the peace 
process advances, because it was agreed that the negotiations 
over Jerusalem would start only during the last stage of the 
agreement. [end recording]

  [Text] Gaza, Jerusalem Press -- For the first time since 
its inception outside the occupied territories on 1 January 
1965, Fatah -- the Palestinian National Liberation Movement -- 
has publicly opened the door of membership to its ranks. 
  In a statement, Fatah said the need to rebuild its 
structures 
is the main reason why it is inviting the Palestinians in the 
Gaza Strip to join up. Fatah operated as a secret organization 
until the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of 
Principles on 13 September 1993. 
  The statement, which was signed by the Fatah Mobilization 
and 
Reorganization Department, announced the opening of several 
offices in the Gaza Strip to enable Palestinians to join the 
movement.

  [Text] Tunis, 29 May (MENA) -- Authoritative Palestinian 
sources have stated that recent rumors circulated by Israeli and 
foreign media about the deterioration of the health of PLO 
Chairman Yasir 'Arafat are untrue and mere lies. The sources 
said 'Arafat's health is good; in the past few days he has been 
chairing meetings of the Palestinian National Authority Council. 
  The sources explained that 'Arafat recently underwent 
medical 
tests at the military hospital in Tunis under the supervision of 
a team of prominent doctors. The tests lasted only two hours, 
after which 'Arafat resumed his activity. The sources noted 
that the doctors advised 'Arafat to get some rest. However, 
this advice is not new. Such advice has been given to him 
several times in the past because of his hectic activity and 
frequent travel. 
  Regarding the rumors circulated by Western and Israeli media 
that 'Arafat has divorced his wife Suha Tawil, the Palestinian 
sources said these rumors are untrue and that 'Arafat and his 
wife are leading a normal life. 
  The Palestinian sources said that the recent rumors of 
'Arafat's illness and his divorce are an attempt to divert 
attention from the course of peace and the gains which 'Arafat, 
his negotiators, and the PLO Executive Committee members have 
achieved. 
  The sources said that these rumors are part of a plan of 
provocation and attrition that began with the campaign on 
'Arafat following his address at a Johannesburg mosque in which 
he spoke about a jihad to liberate Palestine. These rumors then 
turned into a media campaign against 'Arafat and Suha Tawil. 
  The sources did not rule out that this campaign will 
continue 
before and after 'Arafat's return to Jericho.

  [Text] Tunis, 30 May (KUNA) -- The PLO has strongly denied 
the existence of an agreement with Israel to deport Palestinian 
refugees in Lebanon to east Europe. 
  The PLO added in a statement, a copy which has reached KUNA, 
that it has become necessary to reiterate clearly and publicly 
that there was no foundation whatsoever to the reports on the 
deportation of thousands of people to East European counties, to 
al-Hirmil, to the Biqa' valley, or anywhere else. 
  The statement went on to say: It is important that our 
people everywhere, particularly in Lebanon, should know that the 
PLO did not reach agreement with anyone on the problem of 
Palestinian refugees in Lebanon or elsewhere. 
  The statement described such reports as fabrications which 
could only be hatched by people with bad intentions who fish for 
rumors in order to use them to the detriment of the Palestinian 
people's unity. It added that the "problem of refugees is a 
sacred topic which no one should manipulate. It is furthermore 
an issue which revolves around the sacred right of return which 
is cherished by the PLO and every Palestinian."

<F P=106> [Report by Sa'id Mu'addi about a visit to Jericho by Russian </F>
envoy Viktor Posuvalyuk on 29 May -- recorded] 
  [Text] At the Palestinian police headquarters in Jericho 
this afternoon, the Russian president's special envoy Viktor 
Posuvalyuk met with the Palestinian police commander in the 
Jericho area, Brigadier General Isma'il Jabr. The meeting was 
attended by the Russian ambassador to Israel and head of 
Preventive Security in the West Bank, Colonel Jibril al-Rujub. 
The meeting was held in the context of the Russian envoy's 
Middle East tour. He congratulated the Palestinians on the 
implementation of self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. Following the 
meeting he had this to say: 
  [Begin recording] [Posuvalyuk] I congratulated the 
Palestinians in the name of President Yeltsin on this first 
fruit of the Oslo, Washington, and Cairo agreements. We highly 
appreciate the policies pursued by the PLO and in particular Mr. 
Yasir 'Arafat. We also highly appreciate the efforts of all 
those who helped the parties take this first step. As 
cosponsors of the conference, we must say that we highly 
appreciate Yitzhaq Rabin government's policy that made it 
possible for the Palestinians to come to Gaza and Jericho. 
Russia wants the Palestinians to stick the course of the 
negotiating process and band together and avert any internal 
disagreements. This is their first opportunity to take 
responsibility for their own affairs -- an opportunity that they 
should use and then carry on with the peace process. 
  [Mu'addi] What kind of aid Russia may extend to the 
Palestinians? 
  [Posuvalyuk] The aid President Yeltsin and Yasir 'Arafat 
discussed in Moscow is now being considered in earnest in Moscow. 
  [Mu'addi] Did you pass on a message from the Syrian 
president to Mr. Rabin? 
  [Posuvalyuk] No. I communicated a message from Yeltsin to 
Mr. Rabin. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, Brig. Gen. Isma'il Jabr, has said that Russia, as 
cosponsor of the peace process, is continuing to support the 
peace process. 
  [Begin Jabr recording] We thank the Russian envoy for 
visiting Jericho to congratulate us on the launching of the 
Palestinian national authority. We thank President Yeltsin and 
all the friendly Russian people. In our meeting, both of us 
expressed the hope the peace process will continue and that 
Russia will lend its full support to the Palestinians and the 
peace process. [end recording]

  [Text] Brother President Yasir 'Arafat, president of the 
state of Palestine and chairman of the PLO Executive Committee, 
this evening received Mr. John McCarthy, U.S. ambassador to 
Tunisia. 
  During the meeting, President 'Arafat received from his 
excellency the U.S. ambassador an important message from Mr. 
Warren Christopher, the U.S. secretary of state, pertaining to 
the incident that led to the killing of two Israeli soldiers in 
the Erez area at the northern exit of Gaza Sector yesterday 
morning, and the gravity such incident poses to the peace 
process. 
  The message also concerns the invitation of Norway, in its 
capacity as president of the Liaison Committee of Donators to 
hold an urgent meeting on this coming Monday, 23 May, in 
Washington. 
  Secretary Christopher stressed in his message the United 
States' support for this meeting and its success in order to 
begin the process of development to consolidate peace. 
  It is worth noting that the aim of the perpetrators was not 
only to confront the Israelis who withdrew from Gaza two days 
ago, but also to confront the Palestinian national security and 
its direct responsibilities in the Gaza Sector and to its 
population according to the signed agreement.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Agreement Is an Established Fact"] </F>
  [Excerpts] With the signing of the "Declaration of 
Principles" in Washington on 13 September 1993 a new era has 
dawned in Palestinian-Israeli relations, namely the "era of 
peace." This era has been characterized by a gradual 
transformation in Palestinian and Israeli concepts in the 
direction of achieving a "historic reconciliation." [passage 
omitted] With the signing of the "Executive Agreement of the 
Declaration of Principles" in Cairo on 4 May 1994, the era of 
peace has become a reality. The agreement has become a tool for 
the two sides to build this era with a spirit of understanding 
and with common faith that coexistence and mutual and balanced 
cooperation are the fate of the two peoples throughout this good 
land, the land of peace. [passage omitted] 
  Regrettably, the Israeli Government looks as if it is not 
ready to cope with the Palestinian readiness to expedite the 
implementation of the agreement. It has begun to speak with a 
loud voice from all the partners in its cabinet about its doubts 
about whether the Palestinians will adhere to the agreement. 
The Israeli Government has offered feeble excuses for these 
doubts and has begun to adopt stances relying on incorrect and 
convoluted interpretations of Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat's address in a Johannesburg mosque in which he made 
remarks about "Jerusalem" and the "agreement." The Israeli 
Government adopted similar stances when the Palestinian 
Authority dealt with the issue of the laws and administrative 
regulations that will be applicable in the autonomous regions. 
Yet a third time, the Israeli Government raised a hue and cry 
regarding the Palestinians' weapons following the Erez 
checkpoint operation on the crossing point between Israel and 
the Gaza Strip. The Israeli General Staff threatened to 
reoccupy the Gaza Strip after Rabin ordered the closure of the 
Strip's border for nine days. He followed this order with 
another one closing off the Jericho area on the pretext of 
Israel's security needs. 
  The excuses on which Israel has based its doubts regarding 
the Palestinian National Authority's commitment to the agreement 
are self-defeating. They are good reasons to contest Israel's 
adherence to the peace process and its commitment to the 
agreement. The Palestinians have not given up and will not give 
up Jerusalem. They have affirmed their adherence to their right 
to claim it for national, historic, and religious 
considerations. Because the solution of the Jerusalem issue 
would be the real guarantee of achieving and safeguarding peace, 
and as a result of the Palestinian stand on Jerusalem, this 
issue has been considered among the issues that will be put 
aside for discussion in the subsequent phases of the 
negotiations. Regarding the operation that was carried out 
against the Israelis at the entrance to the Gaza Strip, the 
Palestinian stand toward it has been clear, leaving no room for 
the Israelis to exploit it. The Palestinian Authority said that 
the target of the perpetrators of the operation was not only the 
Israelis but also and actually Palestinian national security and 
their direct responsibility for the Gaza Strip and those living 
there in accordance with the agreement. 
  Regarding the excuse of the Palestinian weapons, the 
Palestinian Security Command has stated that it is in the 
process of counting and registering these weapons. As for the 
Israeli demand that these weapons be collected at a time when 
Israel is insisting on the settlers' right to keep and carry 
their weapons in accordance with Israeli laws, this demand is 
illogical in that it does not achieve equality. Besides, the 
settlers in the autonomous region and their carrying of weapons 
must be subject to Palestinian law and not Israeli law.

  [Text] Another incident between the IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] and the Palestinian police occurred near the Erez 
checkpoint yesterday. Our military correspondent Alon Ben-David 
reports that an argument erupted between an IDF patrol and the 
Palestinian police, during which the Palestinian policemen 
cocked their weapons and aimed them at an Israeli officer. The 
Palestinians claim that the IDF soldiers cocked their weapons 
first, while the IDF soldiers claim the Palestinians threatened 
them without cause. The joint liaison and coordination 
committee launched an investigation into the incident.

to hand over to Israel alleged perpetrators of operations 
against the Israeli state who seek refuge in the self-rule areas.

under our control. Maj. Gen. Nasri Yusuf also said that the 
Palestinian police will issue arms licenses to the self-rule 
inhabitants, but will not permit weapons to be carried on the 
streets as they should be kept at home.

  [Text] Palestinian National Authority Member Dr. Riyad 
al-Za'nun has stated that the attainment of security stability 
in the self-rule areas and the issue of development are two of 
the authority's priorities in the forthcoming stage. 
  In statements published in Cairo yesterday, brother Riyad 
al-Za'nun said that the issue of settlements and settlers is 
part of the strategy of the Israeli occupation, which seeks to 
create facts on the ground that hamper the peace process. 
  He emphasized the importance of the democratic option and 
said that pluralism and respect for other parties' opinions is 
the chosen course for the Palestinian's in the next stage. 
  Brother Riyad al-Za'nun also criticized the Israeli campaign 
against the Palestinian command's decision to reactivate the 
laws that were in force before June 1967. He said: It is 
inconceivable for the Palestinian Authority to maintain the 
Israeli laws.

  [Text] Some 7,500 youths were registered at police 
recruitment centers in the Gaza Strip today. Shlomi Eldar 
reports that five such centers were opened today and thousands 
have been swarming to them since the early morning hours. The 
centers will be open all week, and 4,000 policemen will be 
selected. Those selected will undergo training at existing 
facilities in the Gaza Strip, including a beach facility which 
used to be the Ansar 2 prison camp. To date there are about 
2,600 policemen in the Gaza Strip. Tomorrow they will be joined 
by about 250 additional policemen from Algeria. 
  Few are leaving Judaea and Samaria for work within the Green 
Line, and a mass demonstration was staged in Janin today against 
the continued closure. Many residents paraded the streets, 
complaining that the prolonged closure has caused grave economic 
distress, and that many are unemployed and have no means of 
livelihood. Some of the participants even criticized the PLO 
leadership which, so they claim, deals with Gaza and Jericho 
only and has abandoned the remaining residents of the 
territories. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1800 GMT on 29 May adds 
that "in a commitment to the Gaza Strip Palestinian police, 
Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] is trying to stop acts of 
revenge and killing against those who collaborate with Israel. 
Correspondent Nisim Qeynan reports that this commitment was 
published in a manifesto disseminated by Hamas in the Gaza 
Strip."]

  [Text] Gaza -- Maj. Gen. Nasr Yusuf, commander of the 
Palestine National Security Forces in the Gaza Strip, has stated 
that the Palestinian National Authority will arrest any person 
who collaborated with Israel or who will do so in the future 
outside the framework of the authority, provided that there is 
sufficient evidence. 
  Asked about Israel's stance on the arrest of agents who 
collaborated with it, Maj. Gen. Yusuf said in an exclusive 
interview that "this is an internal Palestinian affair. No one 
can compel us to pardon or to arrest anyone." He added that 
what we are doing on this matter is similar to what any other 
national authority in the world would do. 
  On the stance of the National Security Forces in the event a 
joint patrol comes under fire by Palestinian opponents, he said 
his forces have security duties that they will implement 
regardless of the circumstances because our people support any 
measure that provides them with security and stability. 
  Maj. Gen. Yusuf disclosed that the authority is holding 
constant contacts with the Hamas leadership, noting that there 
have been good results so far and that he is optimistic that an 
agreement will be reached. 
  He said that he does not oppose peaceful demonstrations but 
that in the next stage such things will require a permit. 
  On the other hand, Maj. Gen. Yusuf said the main problem 
facing his forces is the shortage of funds, which the donor 
nations have promised to give to the Palestinian National 
Authority to pay the salaries of the security forces. He said: 
"They have given nothing, other than the vehicles provided by 
the United States." 
  Maj. Gen. Yusuf said a 300-man police force is expected to 
arrive in the Gaza Strip today to join the current force 
estimated at 2,600 men. He added that 120 men from the Fatah 
Hawks have been merged with the national security forces in view 
of their security expertise and knowledge of the Gaza Strip.

  [Text] Rafah, 30 May (MENA) -- Major General 'Abd-al-Razzaq 
al-Mahayidah, commander of the Palestinian forces in Rafah, has 
affirmed that the Palestinian National Security Forces will not 
be an obstacle in the way of democracy and that the objective of 
their presence in the autonomous areas is to support preventive 
security and preserve public security. 
  Al-Mahayidah said that it is each person's right to express 
his political opinions and views in absolute freedom and that 
the relationship with the Palestinian opposition will be a 
serious one governed by understanding out of concern for the 
bonds of kinship and strong ties between the various 
denominations of the people. 
  In another development, the Palestinian National Security 
Command issued a decree on recruiting further members of the 
police force from inside the autonomous areas in Gaza and 
Jericho. Applications to join the police force began being 
accepted the day before yesterday. 
  It is expected that all parts of the Palestinian National 
Authority will be ready to operate this week.

<F P=106> [By Sakher Abu Eloun] </F>
  [Text] Gaza City, Gaza Strip, May 30 (AFP) -- PLO 
guerrillas who joined the new police force stormed out of their 
training camp on Monday [30 May] demanding guns to protect 
themselves, one of their leaders told AFP. 
  The walkout came after suspected Israeli agents in a car 
chased four of the men from the Hawks, the armed wing of the 
mainstream PLO group Fatah. 
  "Out of 90 Hawks who began training four days ago, 70 have 
left," said Rajih Abu-Sita, one of the Hawk leaders. 
  "We are returning to the Hawks, to protect ourselves and 
defend ourselves if attacked." 
  An AFP correspondent met several Hawks as they quit the camp 
in the former Israeli base known as Ansar II on the Gaza City 
seafront. 
  Abu-Sita and his cousin 'Amr killed a Jewish settler on the 
Gaza Strip in March 1993 and were wanted by the Israelis before 
autonomy began at the start of this month. 
  "We can't go on," Rajih said. "This is not a camp but a 
bazaar. There is no security, neither inside nor outside the 
camp. We don't even have any weapons. 
  "On Sunday when we went into town armed men in a Peugeot 504 
chased us. We were lucky to escape." 
  The two cousins sent a letter Sunday to Palestinian police 
chief General Nasr Yusuf to explain why they were leaving. 
  "There is no security in the camp," they wrote. "We are 
still hunted by Israeli intelligence services even if there is 
an agreement between Israel and the PLO. 
  "We want protection and weapons because we still feel we are 
in danger." 
  Rajih said: "Rabin has left certain elements here to kill 
us." 
  He also complained that the training camp was supposed to be 
solely for former Hawks. 
  "We were surprised to find about 100 other recruits who did 
not belong to our group, who were not wanted by the Israelis and 
who had never even carried out any political activities. 
  "We want to be soldiers for our country and for Fatah," he 
added. 
  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin also upset the new recruits 
with 
a hardline statement Friday that Israel vetted all the new 
policemen. 
  "No Palestinian policemen from the territories has been 
recruited without our agreement and we have never stopped 
checking that is the case." 
  Rabin said Israel had vetoed the names of several hundred 
Palestinians who had been due to join the police from abroad. 
  He was reacting to Hebrew press reports that the Abu-Sita 
cousins had enlisted in the new force, which is about 4,000 
strong and is due to swell to 9,000 men. 
  "What we say to Rabin is, 'You want to catch all those who 
are wanted because they have killed settlers and collaborators. 
But who killed all our martyrs? You have to answer that 
question,'" Rajih said.

  [Text] The Alliance of Palestinian Forces [APF] issued a 
political statement following a recent meeting during which the 
APF discussed political and security developments in the 
Palestinian arena. The conferees examined some of the serious 
measures undertaken by the corrupt Oslo team in the context of 
the Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
  In its statement, the APF said that the suspect role 
assigned 
to the so-called Palestinian police has shown them to be a 
repressive tool in the hand of the Zionist occupation. As part 
of the practical arrangements agreed on between the Oslo team 
and the Zionist enemy, a number of those affiliated with the 
Zionist enemy agencies made statements on disarming our people 
and their militant forces and on opening prisons for our 
people's honorable strugglers. In this context, they have 
started by detaining Hani 'Abid, an Islamic Jihad member, and 
pursuing our people's strugglers who reject the Oslo agreement 
and all its appendices, chapters, and objectives. 
  The APF statement adds: We in the APF warn of the gravity of 
this dangerous behavior which will lead to detrimental results, 
sedition, and internal strife. We urge the masses of our people 
and their militant forces to firmly confront the practices of 
this team which has violated the will of our people, and its 
agencies which have been proved to be dens designed to absorb 
agents and spies linked to the Zionist enemy.

  [Text] Gaza City, Gaza Strip, May 29 (AFP) -- The Muslim 
fundamentalist group Hamas said Sunday [29 May] it would 
temporarily stop killing people suspected of collaborating with 
Israel, but the Palestinian police said the pledge did not go 
far enough. 
  Hamas said it had decided "to halt, for the time being, the 
pursuit of agents and their execution, in order to allow the 
Palestinian police to carry out their duties in this area." 
  But it warned that "the role of agents is turning more and 
more dangerous for the mujahedeen (Islamic fighters), who 
consider themselves in a constant struggle against the (Israeli) 
occupation forces." 
  A Palestinian police official, declining to be named, told 
AFP that the pledge was not enough. 
  "They have not handed over the culprits of Friday's 
executions and we are going to launch a search for them ... not 
because it is Hamas but because they have broken the law and 
killed people living under our authority," he said. 
  The police earlier ordered Hamas to hand over militants who 
killed two Palestinians found hanging from electric pylons, in 
the first such murders since self-rule was launched this month. 
  "We have officially asked Hamas leaders to hand them over so 
we can try them. It is as much in their interest as it is in 
ours that they do it," said police chief Nasir Yusuf. 
  He said it was unacceptable that Hamas act as "prosecutor, 
lawyer, judge and hangman." 
  Control for security on the autonomous Gaza Strip and the 
self-rule enclave of Jericho has passed to the Palestinian 
police under the terms of the Israel-PLO autonomy deal, an 
agreement which Hamas opposes.

  [Text] Damascus, May 30 (AFP) -- The Muslim fundamentalist 
group Hamas on Monday [30 May] refused to hand over militants 
who killed two suspected collaborators in Gaza to the 
Palestinian police. 
  It charged that the two men had been "planning to 
assassinate 
Hamas and Fatah leaders to stir up trouble and provoke fighting" 
between the fundamentalists and the PLO's main group. 
  "We refuse to hand over our militants and hope that the 
Palestinian police can carry out its role of pursuing 
collaborators. If so, it will save Hamas having to do it," the 
group said in a statement released in Damascus. 
  It warned police chief Nasr Yusuf to handle "this delicate 
situation" with care "so as not to provoke reactions which would 
not be in the interests of our people and their unity." 
  On the autonomous Gaza Strip, Yusuf issued a stern warning 
to 
Islamic fundamentalists after Hamas executed the two suspects on 
Friday and demanded that the killers be handed over. 
  Hamas announced Sunday it would stop killing collaborators, 
but only temporarily to see if the police could do its job. 
  Almost 1,000 Palestinians have been murdered by fellow 
Palestinians since the intifadah erupted in December 1987, but 
Israel maintains that fewer than 40 percent were collaborators.

  [Text] Commenting on statements by Robert Pelletreau, U.S. 
assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern and South Asian 
affairs, on a rift within the Hamas Movement, Hamas official 
Muhammad Nazzal said: I defy Pelletreau to name one Hamas 
leader inside or outside the occupied territories who is working 
to divide the movement, or who has deviated from its consensus 
of rejecting participation in the Palestinian authority or in 
the self-rule farce. 
  Nazzal said that the U.S. official's statements are sheer 
fabrications and part of the false reports claiming that the 
'Arafat leadership has succeeded in gaining the support of 
several Hamas leaders in the occupied territories for the 
Palestinian Authority, thus deviating from the movement's 
constants of rejecting the capitulatory march and abiding by 
armed struggle and protracted Jihad until all the Palestinian 
national soil is liberated. 
  Pelletreau has claimed that a rift recently developed within 
Hamas in the occupied territories over participation in the 
Palestinian National Authority.

<F P=106> [Report by Yoram Kohen] </F>
  [Text] A closure was imposed today on Jericho. Major 
General Ilan Biran, commander of the Central Command, decided to 
ban Israelis from entering the city until further notice. Our 
Army affairs correspondent Alon Ben-David reports that Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement] was scheduled to hold a rally in 
the city this evening and the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] was 
worried about possible terror attacks. Earlier today Hamas 
staged a few processions in the city. Yoram Kohen reports: 
  [Begin Kohen recording] Today's procession in Jericho was a 
first test. Most participants came from outside the city, from 
Gaza and the West Bank. Hamas leaders in the territories sent 
hundreds of supporters to Jericho, seemingly to test the 
patience of the Palestinian police commanders. A similar 
demonstration was held recently in Gaza. 
  The Hamas rally started with a procession bearing 
provocative 
religious symbols, Koran books, and green flags, and marchers 
proudly chanting: 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam is our mentor. The 
Palestinian police commanders explained their decision to allow 
Hamas to hold the rally in Jericho's big mosque by saying that 
theirs was a democratic society which did not shut people up, 
perhaps out of a wish to avoid confrontations. 
  Such a concentration of Hamas members in the self-rule area 
led Maj. Gen. Biran to take precautions. Consequently, he 
banned Israelis from entering the city until further notice.

  [Text] Jericho, West Bank, May 30 (AFP) -- Around 2,000 
supporters of the Muslim fundamentalist group Hamas marched 
through the autonomous enclave of Jericho on Monday [30 May], in 
the first such demonstration since Palestinian self-rule. 
  Palestinian sources said the marchers, who converged on the 
town from around the Israeli-occupied West Bank, went on to hold 
a public meeting in a mosque. 
  Brandishing the Koran, the Moslem holy book, and waving 
flags, they called for the "liberation of the whole of 
Palestine." However, they steered clear in their slogans of 
attacking the Israeli-PLO autonomy deal, which Hamas rejects. 
  Dozens of Palestinian policemen stood by, but there were no 
incidents, the sources said. It was the first Hamas 
demonstration here since the police took over Jericho in mid-May. 
  The Israeli army closed off access to the enclave for 
Israeli 
civilians to avoid incidents, military sources said.

  [Text] Shots were fired last night on the Jewish 
settlement of Kfar Darom in the center of the Gaza Strip. The 
gunfire came from a group of cars with Palestinian license 
plates which were traveling on the main road toward Khan Yunus. 
Kfar Darom residents returned the fire. No one was hurt on 
either side. The joint Israeli-Palestinian patrol arrived on 
the scene to investigate the incident. 
  In the territories last night, a Molotov cocktail was thrown 
at an Israeli bus near the settlement of Shavey Shomron. The 
bomb exploded on the road, no one was hurt. 
  The Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] terrorist 
organization has announced it intends to form a political party 
in the territories, but at the same time the Hamas spokesman, 
speaking in Amman, denied that a representative of the 
organization, Sa'id Balal, has agreed to become a member of the 
Palestinian National Authority. If Balal has chosen to take 
part in the authority, said the spokesman, it was on his own 
initiative, not as a representative of Hamas. 
  The Palestinian police chief in Gaza, Nasr Yusuf, has called 
on Hamas members to stop their killing attacks and hand over 
their weapons. In a leaflet distributed in Gaza, the police 
also asked Hamas to turn in the people responsible for killing 
two Palestinians suspected of cooperating with Israel. 
  In other developments, about half the Fatah Hawks police 
recruits have quit, claiming there were informers among the 
conscripts. And last night some 260 Palestinian policemen 
entered Gaza from Egypt.

meeting regarding the recent session of the UN Security Council. 
  The joint meeting asserted that the positive positions 
expressed during last March's session have been strengthened and 
have increased the number of Security Council member states that 
voice a positive position toward Iraq and call for lifting the 
unjust blockade imposed on it. 
  It is now obvious that the overwhelming majority of the 
Security Council member states call for acknowledging the 
progress made in applying Security Council resolutions and for 
the need to discuss the lifting of the blockade as soon as 
possible. It has also become clear that the U.S. position is 
the principal obstacle to lifting the blockade for reasons that 
have nothing to do with the Security Council's resolutions, that 
this position has been isolated in the Security Council and is 
not supported by the majority of the Security Council's member 
states, and that U.S. statements on the continuation of the 
blockade and postponing plans to lift it express nervousness 
caused by the isolation of the U.S. position in the Security 
Council and the international community, which is stepping up 
its demand that the unjust blockade, which has begun to 
embarrass the U.S. position inside and outside the Security 
Council, be lifted. 
  The spokesman said: The leadership in Iraq highly values the 
states which adopted a fair position during the Council's 
debates, especially Russia, France, China, Brazil, Spain, 
Pakistan, Nigeria, and other states in the Council. 
  The spokesman appealed to these states and the international 
community in general to strengthen and develop their position 
and work persistently to lift the unjust blockade. 
  A plan has been drawn up to continue contacts with these 
states, as well as with Arab and international sides during the 
coming period. 
  The meeting was attended by Hatim Hamdan al-'Azzawi, chief 
of 
the Presidential Office.

  [Excerpts] Deputy Prime Ministers Taha Yasin Ramadan and 
Tariq 'Aziz and the ministers took the constitutional oath today 
before leader Saddam Husayn, president of the republic and prime 
minister, may God preserve him. 
  The leader president, may God preserve him, chaired the 
first 
meeting of the new Council of Ministers which lasted 
approximately four and a half hours. During this meeting, his 
excellency delivered the following valuable and important speech: 
  First, we would like to thank brother Ahmad Husayn for 
assuming the tasks of the prime minister over the past period. 
He exerted his utmost in this field. 
  The statement of the Revolution Command Council was very 
clear. Our assessment was that our circumstances require this 
formula in terms of the presidency's relationship with the 
Council of Ministers, despite the fact that it will increase our 
burdens and cost us extra time. This, however, is required. 
  You will continue to assume your ministerial posts, except 
the agriculture minister, who was previously a minister. Now, 
he is a comrade in the party and a governor and knows our 
course. The new thing, however, is the new situation. 
  The new thing is that, as you recall, we addressed the 
Iraqis 
on one occasion and told them: You are in the last 10 days of 
Ramadan. Some people interpreted this by saying that these are 
the last 10 days and that the blockade will be lifted on 'Id 
al-Fitr. They also said that something would happen. I heard 
these interpretations from some people. 
  Meanwhile, what we meant by the last 10 days is the fact 
that 
the largest period of time has passed and that the reward of the 
whole month will be gained during the last 10 days. In other 
words, man will either succeed or fail. The last 10 days need 
additional patience and efforts so that man will gain the reward 
of fasting during the month of Ramadan. 
  Addressing the members of the Council of Ministers, his 
excellency said: 
  In the past, ministers might have taken their time and read 
the newspapers before beginning work. But, now, the first thing 
I will do is read the newspapers after dealing with the basic 
components of the morning mail. As of now, every minister 
should be in his office at 0800. This is the first measure to 
be carried out by all, except the sick person, who should 
telephone Dr. Khalil al-Ma'muri, secretary of the Council of 
Ministers, to inform him that he cannot report to work at his 
ministry. This will help us know that he is sick, to be 
reassured about him, to wish him good health, and to follow up 
his medical situation. Those who are not sick should be present 
in their ministry at 0800. I do not want any other excuses. 
[passage omitted] 
  What we want to discuss in this meeting -- which has no 
agenda -- is the living conditions of our people and some 
phenomena which I noticed in the state departments in general so 
that the brother ministers will work toward overcoming these 
phenomena once we reach agreement on them. 
  Regarding the people's standard of living, I will explain to 
you how I see the prices so that you will not imagine that I am 
not aware of the minor details and that I am not aware of minor 
things in the life of the people, and consequently, I would ask 
you for things that would appear illogical. [passage omitted] 
  I want to say to you that I follow up things and think them 
over as much as I can. Do not imagine that I am unaware of 
things. I follow up people's life. I want to say that we can 
do something, but what is it? 
  I prefer that we hold a dialogue about this and that each of 
you makes his suggestions. I hope that you make these 
suggestions as brief and concise as possible. 
  The deputy prime ministers and the ministers presented a 
number of ideas and proposals which were discussed. 
  The leader president then said: 
  The blockade will end just as any other issue. Wars have 
ended and there are still other wars. The blockade started on a 
certain day, and there must be a day when it will end. It is 
clear that the remaining time is less than the time which has 
elapsed. I believe that the expression we used before is 
accurate. However, the basis which will end the blockade, keep 
Iraq just as its sons want it to be, and end any strong storm 
with the fewest losses or sacrifices, with the continuation of 
the basic constants wished by its sons, the people of the 
country, lies in the people of the country themselves. The basis 
lies in the people of the country. The responsibility increases 
gradually in accordance with the level of influence and center 
of influence among the people of the country. It is natural 
that the minister's responsibility of steadfastness differs from 
the responsibility of others. This means that the minister's 
sense of responsibility and the level and size of influence 
differs from that of the ordinary employee or citizen in the 
state of Iraq. Thus, this includes members of the leadership, 
beginning with the ministry's under secretary, the director 
general, and ends with the end of the job scale. 
  From the beginning we said that the basis that will fragment 
or lift the blockade is you. Why you? Because the more you 
increase your people's patience and ability to stand fast, the 
more this will be in your favor to end the blockade in an 
honorable way. Praise be to God that the country's 
capabilities, its sons' capacity, and the level of their 
awareness have remained as they are regardless of some 
exceptions which occur as a result of a quick assessment or a 
quick or hasty stand. I know the national essence of the people 
of the country. They understand that they have no other choice. 
This is how the situation can be decided the way we wish. The 
ministers, when they increase their activity in their offices 
and make their mental and organizational ability more efficient 
and more effective, will play a role in increasing the patience 
of the citizen, whether he is an employee or something else. 
  It seems that some sides mobilized the people in a way which 
was interpreted as if the Iraqis should wait for good news, in a 
dramatic sense, after the UN Security Council's meeting which 
was held in May. This is wrong and is contrary to our policy. 
Our policy says that we are working in the international arena 
with all our capabilities and mental abilities. However, the 
basis which changes the international approach is the Iraqis' 
position. The Iraqis weaken their position in the international 
arena when they grumble too much and when their balance of 
patience is disrupted. They weaken their position in the 
international community, which has a purpose. Even he who has 
no purpose will no longer be enthusiastic about insisting on 
shortening the time for lifting the blockade when he sees the 
people's resistance against the blockade has become weak. 
[passage omitted] 
  Our citizens have a nationalist nature. They can hear facts, 
and therefore, we must clarify facts to them in order to be 
balanced. They have been used to this issue since 1969. When 
onions, potatoes, or tomatoes become scarce, they make an issue 
out of this, and when we give them a solution by the available 
means, all of them will stand in the right position. So, let's 
do so and rely on God. 
  At the end of the meeting, specialized committees were 
formed 
to study some urgent issues. The results of their actions will 
be presented to the Council of Ministers soon.

  [Text] A Foreign Ministry official has stated the 
following to the IRAQI NEWS AGENCY: 
  The Iraqi Foreign Ministry is amazed at the unwarranted 
decision of the U.S. Department of State to ask the head of the 
Iraqi interests section to leave the United States. By way of 
justifying its inexcusable decision, the Department of State 
contended that the Iraqi diplomat, who has since returned to 
Baghdad, had been engaged in diplomatic and media activity 
incompatible with the agreement under which the two sides opened 
sections for looking after Iraqi and American interests in 
Baghdad and Washington. 
  Our interests section head in Washington, the Foreign 
Ministry statement went on, never engaged in any action, 
conduct, or activity incompatible with the most basic principles 
of diplomacy. Our interests section head in Washington was not 
involved in anything beyond the kind of activities that occupied 
his predecessor, to whom the U.S. Department of State never 
objected. We, therefore, think that there is no real 
justification for the American Department of State's decision. 
The decision may have been motivated by political or 
psychological factors that have no connection with the 
activities of the head of the Iraqi interests section in 
Washington. 
  In any case, we will increase the staff of our interests 
section in Washington in accordance with the bilateral 
agreement. The American interests section in Baghad operates 
out of the Polish Embassy under the Polish flag.

  [Text] Amman, May 29 (AFP) -- UN disarmament chief Rolf 
Ekeus said Sunday he had made headway in talks here with Iraqi 
officials on applying UN resolutions to destroy Iraq's weapons 
of mass destruction. 
  "We have made certain progress. But we have to preserve it 
to maintain the momentum," Ekeus told AFP after meeting Iraqi 
Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf late Saturday, who was 
on a stopover en route for Cairo. 
  The head of the UN Special Commission for Iraqi disarmament 
(UNSCOM) is to present a report to the UN Security Council on 
Tuesday on setting up a long-term monitoring of Iraqi military 
capability due to start in July, a reliable source said. 
  Ekeus was due to resume talks late Sunday with an Iraqi 
delegation including General 'Amir Rashid head of the Iraqi 
military industries. 
  He expressed his "satisfaction" over the initial talks with 
Iraqi officials, saying they aimed at "clarifying certain issues 
in order to make progress." 
  "We are fairly satisfied, although we have not concluded our 
talks yet," he said noting that any eventual lifting of the 
Iraqi sanctions would be decided by the Security Council. 
  A UN embargo was imposed on Iraq when it invaded Kuwait in 
August 1990, before Iraqi President Saddam Husayn's army was 
driven out again by a U.S. led coalition in February 1991. 
  But the embargo has remained in force backed by UN 
resolutions requiring Iraq to destroy its weapons of mass 
destruction and set up a long-term monitoring system. 
  Ekeus said the aim was to get the embargo lifted, adding 
that 
"we are trying to establish whether (Iraq) has respected the UN 
resolutions." 
  Iraq has argued on several occasions that it has complied 
fully with the resolutions. 
  He is in Amman for a meeting of the UN Economic and Social 
Commission for Western Asia, which opened Sunday.

<F P=106> [Report by Selin Caglayan: "Talabani and Barzani Will Meet </F>
in Turkey"] 
  [Text] Ankara--Democratic Party of Kurdistan Leader Mas'ud 
Barzani and Patriotic Union of Kurdistan Leader Jalal Talabani 
will meet in Turkey to end the clashes between their supporters 
in northern Iraq. It has been ascertained that Talabani is 
already on his way. 
  It has also been ascertained that Turkey has been trying to 
convince the two sides to end the clashes in northern Iraq and 
that these efforts have begun to yield positive results. It has 
been reported that Talabani and Barzani have conferred by 
telephone several times during the past three days and agreed to 
a cease-fire. There is a very strong possibility the two leaders 
will meet in Silopi in a few days. 
  Sarcil Kazaz, Jalal Talabani's representative in Ankara, is 
currently in Damascus. He has replied to the questions HURRIYET 
put to him by telephone. Kazaz said: "We have been in constant 
touch with the Turkish officials during the past few days. 
Turkey is a friendly and neighboring country and we take its 
views very seriously." 
  Kazaz also asserted that Talabani left for the region after 
reaching an agreement with Mas'ud Barzani by telephone. 
Stressing that he will travel to northern Iraq through Turkey, 
Kazaz said: "A meeting could be held in Turkey. However, that 
has not yet been finalized." 
  The Turkish officials have confirmed Kazaz's disclosure. 
<H5>  Ankara Warned the Two Leaders </H5>
  It has been reported that Turkey has decided to take certain 
steps because the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] has gained 
significant strength as a result of the clashes between the 
supporters of Talabani and Barzani. Ankara has warned the two 
leaders--who have been trying to find allies against each 
other--not to cooperate with the PKK. The Turkish officials are 
reported to have warned Talabani and Barzani that Turkey will 
support the opposite side and provide it with arms and 
logistical support if any of them decides to cooperate with the 
PKK. It has also been reported that Talabani reacted positively 
to Ankara's warning. That has dispelled the relatively chilly 
atmosphere that existed in his relations with Ankara for a 
rather long time. 
  Meanwhile, Ankara continues to be worried about the 
emigration of Turkey's Kurdish citizens in southeastern Anatolia 
to northern Iraq. In fact, it is expected to make a disclosure 
on the condition of the Kurdish citizens who have been forced to 
emigrate by the PKK. It has been reported that it may call on 
them to return and guarantee that the Government will consider 
their complaints.

  [Text] Baghdad, 29 May (INA)--AL-THAWRAH stresses that the 
impulsive decision that has been made against the Iraqi employee 
responsible for looking after the Iraqis' interests in the 
United States is unmistakable evidence of the weak U.S. position. 
  In its "Window" column today, the paper says that the United 
States fears that this lone Iraqi may influence congressmen, 
something which would embarrass the U.S. Administration in its 
attempts to justify the continued imposition of the blockade 
against Iraq. 
  The paper asks: How then does the U.S. Administration view 
the moves made by the Iraqi delegations, led by Tariq 'Aziz, 
that visit the UN headquarters every two months, especially 
since it is aware that such moves have substantial effects, even 
among its allies at the UN Security Council? 
  The paper adds: We are certain that Washington's impulsive 
stands are a reaction to its loss of confidence in its ability 
to convince the American people and their law-makers of its 
policy on maintaining the blockade imposed on Iraq. This is 
evidence of the success of the Iraqi move. Only further 
patience and steadfastness is required, for the American side 
has begun to stagger, and its arguments will inevitably be 
defeated.

  [Text] Al-Sulaymaniyah, Iraqi Kurdistan, 30 May (INA)--The 
renegade Jalal Talabani's gang has carried out killings and acts 
of destruction in Kou Senjaq, claiming the lives of 250 people, 
including 150 civilian women and children. 
  In a report published today, citing arrivals from that area, 
the newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH says that this massacre, in which an 
entire family of a mother and her five children were killed, was 
planned by two criminals; namely, Jabbar Faraman, who is called 
the minister of peshmerga affairs; and Shaykh Ja'far, a military 
commander in the so-called Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, which 
is led by Jalal Talabani. This was part of a plan worked out by 
the traitor Talabani to liquidate the Kurds who are hostile to 
his treasonous political line and who reject his affiliation 
with the foreigners. 
  Mas'ud Barzani still rejects Talabani's return from Damascus 
to his headquarters in Iraqi Kurdistan via the area of Bahdanyan 
[name as received] under Barzani's personal guarantee. Military 
confrontations between the groups of these two renegades are 
still raging in several areas of Iraqi Kurdistan.

  [Text] Baghdad, 28 May (INA)--AL-JUMHURIYAH has said that 
recent changes in the UN Security Council, which has recently 
witnessed support by all UN Security Council member states -- 
with the exception of the United States and Britain -- for the 
lifting the blockade, have made Saudi King Fahd lose his balance 
and abuse Iraq. 
  In its editorial today, the paper adds that when he saw Iraq 
getting prepared to resume its normal life and the role 
compatible with its size, history, and capabilities, Fahd lost 
his mind. For he realizes that this will mean an increase in 
the state of deterioration in Saudi Arabia, a widening gap 
between the treasonous rulers and the masses there, and a 
decline in the importance of the subversive Saudi role on Arab 
and Islamic fronts. 
  Referring to the hostile U.S. role, the paper notes that the 
United States is losing daily its sources of influence on the 
world and regional levels to the forces of freedom and progress. 
The paper notes that this has left the Saudi agents deeply 
concerned about continued U.S. protection against the wrath of 
the peoples that have suffered from their crimes, especially 
since they know well that the "American's God is the dollar." 
  The paper says: Therefore, Iraq's certain and imminent 
return to the regional arena will mean that the United States 
will reconsider the role of Saudi rulers and will leave them 
alone to deal with the realities of the new situation that 
emerged during the Mother of Battles. 
  The paper stresses that as Fahd watches all this, he is 
obsessed day and night by the nightmare that Iraq has past the 
dangerous stage, that it has destroyed all justifications for 
the blockade, and that the world is clearly coming to understand 
Iraq's position. 
  On the same topic, BABIL describes Saudi ruler Fahd as a 
glaring example of the pseudo men afflicting the Arab nation. 
  In an editorial, the paper says that after what he said 
against Iraq, this Arabist bastion and upholder of the banner of 
Islam, the betrayer of the two holy mosques and Judas Iscariot 
can only be described as a dissolute person and a pig. 
  The paper stresses that the Arab nation's history cannot be 
made by dissolute persons and pigs, but faithful leaders with 
clean minds and hearts. Those are makers of the future and the 
pride of the nation. As for the first category, their lot is 
to rot in vice, damnation, and misfortune.

  [Text] Baghdad, 29 May (INA)--The newspaper AL-THAWRAH has 
said that Saudi King Fahd does not hesitate to commit the most 
odious crimes against the Arab people to make sure that his 
rotten regime remains in power. 
  In its "Standpoint" column, the paper says that Fahd, who is 
a robot controlled by his American masters, is more eager than 
his masters to harm the Arab nation and its national security 
and does not hesitate to commit even the most odious crimes 
against the Arab people. 
  The paper stresses that Fahd cannot stand to see a 
neighboring country, such as Iraq, turning into a radiant 
center, nor can he stand to see unity on his regime's border, 
such as the Yemeni unity. Therefore, he imagines that through 
his illegal money he can oppose the course of history and the 
free will of the Arab people in Iraq and Yemen, and that he can 
harm the Arab centers of strength and radiance. 
  The paper says that it is not surprising that the Saudi 
ruler 
should slander Iraq and Yemen in one address full of hatred for 
every glorious and honorable Arab stand and all aspirations for 
unity. The Arab people know Fahd as a meek ruler and an 
obedient servant of his imperialist and Zionist masters. 
  The paper adds that after this ruler instigated the 
colonialist powers, distributing among them the money of the 
Arab people in Najd and Hejaz [Saudi Arabia], and blocked an 
Arab solution to the so-called Gulf crisis, Fahd placed a land 
that belongs to the Arabs and Muslims at the disposal of the 
aggressive Americans and their allies to launch the 30-state 
aggression against Arab, Muslim Iraq.

  [Excerpts] Baghdad, 30 May (INA)--Two Iraqi newspapers 
have asserted that the speech the agent King Fahd delivered to 
the pilgrims revealed the stupidity and ignorance of this 
humiliated servant and disclosed the extent of his enmity, his 
persistence in following evil paths, and his departure from the 
principles and directives of Islam. 
  In two articles published today, AL-THAWRAH and AL-QADISIYAH 
explain that this man [King Fahd], who frequents brothels, bars, 
and gambling lounges, drank too much wine before addressing the 
delegations' heads and members. 
  AL-THAWRAH, the mouthpiece of the Arab Socialist Ba'th 
Party, 
says that Fahd not only lost his awareness and balance, but also 
his memory, so he no longer recalls anything but his own dilemma 
and his comprehensive political and financial difficulties. 
[passage omitted] 
  The paper asserts that all the bribes and grants given by 
the 
rulers of Kuwait to continue the unfair blockade on Iraq will 
not benefit them and will not prevent the fragmentation and 
erosion of this blockade, at which time Fahd will only be left 
with disgrace, shame, and history's curse. 
  AL-QADISIYAH says: It was not strange for the Saudi rulers 
to take this position on the Arab nation's issues. This is 
because Saudi Arabia's very existence is only a colonialist 
creation whose duty is to place obstacles in the way of any 
effort to pool the nation's resources and employ them in the 
service of the Arab people's objectives. [passage omitted] 
  The paper is not surprised by the position of the agent Fahd 
at the end of the pilgrimage season and by his abuses against 
Iraq and its people. It says: It is not strange for this 
regime to work for the internationalization of an internal 
Yemeni affair and deny the legitimate Yemeni authorities their 
right to fight the rebellious secessionists and those who 
encroached upon legitimacy.

<F P=106> [Report by Hamdan al-Hajj] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN Special 
Commission entrusted with disarming Iraq, has said that he will 
submit a detailed report on Iraq's positive positions toward the 
Commission's efforts. At the same time, Ekeus asserted that the 
UN Security Council will discuss the situation in Iraq on 2 
July. He, however, ruled out a final decision on the economic 
blockade imposed on Iraq. He said there will be detailed 
discussions on easing these sanctions. 
  In an exclusive statement to AL-DUSTUR, Ekeus described 
Iraq's response to the Commission's efforts as constructive, 
noting that they supported the Commission's tasks. This is 
despite the fact that Iraq's response to Security Council 
Resolution No. 715 was delayed for at least three years, which 
postponed discussions and monitoring of the arms possessed by 
Iraq. Consequently, this has perpetuated the Iraqi people's 
suffering due to the failure of their leadership to respond to 
the international resolutions. 
  Ekeus said he expected there to be a possibility for 
reducing 
the suffering the Iraqis are facing if precise monitoring and 
follow-up systems for Iraqi arms are worked out. He pointed out 
that if the Security Council member states, particularly those 
with the right to veto, are convinced, matters will become 
easier later. However, matters will not stop at this because 
Iraq will later be asked to recognize the new Kuwaiti border, 
solve some humanitarian issues, and confirm its real intention 
toward regional stability and peace in general. 
  Ekeus noted that the Commission's task is not confined to 
removing and destroying Iraqi arms but also includes verifying 
that Iraq will not acquire these arms again whether by 
manufacturing them, importing them, or both. He asserted that 
Iraq will not be simply left alone after it fully implements and 
totally responds to the Security Council resolutions. There 
will be continuous and long-term monitoring of Iraqi arms 
lasting seven or more years to prevent Iraq from manufacturing 
arms or approaching such things again. He indicated that Iraq 
is one of the richest countries in the world. Who knows what 
Iraq will do after lifting the embargo and ending the suffering 
it is passing through? Iraq may need a few months to recover, 
so monitoring must continue, he said. 
  Ekeus stressed that Iraq should resort to peace, stability, 
and building of its state on bases far from armament in order to 
remove the fears and doubts of its neighbors in the entire 
region. 
  Before departing Amman yesterday evening, Ekeus said the 
Iraqi Government has actually begun to comply with the Security 
Council resolutions pertaining to the economic sanctions on 
Iraq, and that he is optimistic about ending the blockade 
imposed on Iraq in the near future. In a statement to 
AL-DUSTUR, he added that his talks with 'Amir Rashid, head of 
the Iraqi Military Industrialization Organization, were fruitful 
and that he sensed Iraq's real desire for commitment and for 
ending the sanctions imposed on it. 
  Ekeus also met with [Iraq's UN representative] Nizar Hamdun. 
They discussed Iraqi arms, inspection issues, and the extent of 
their conformity with the Security Council resolutions. Ekeus 
said that this is the first time he has met with Iraqi officials 
in Amman.

  [Text] Amman--The Lower House of Parliament has not yet 
responded to a request by a southern Yemeni official to play a 
"prominent role" in mediation efforts to end the war in Yemen in 
accordance with conditions set by the Yemeni Socialist Party 
(YSP) in Aden. 
  House Speaker Tahir al-Masri said Sunday he hasn't yet 
looked 
into ways of dealing with the request, which was made by Anis 
Hasan Yahya, president of "the Provisional Assembly for National 
Salvation" the caretaker parliament in the "Yemen Democratic 
Republic." 
  In the letter, which was faxed to Mr. Masri Saturday 
evening, 
Mr. Yahya called on Jordan to intervene to "end the bloodshed 
and the destruction for our people and country" by demanding an 
end to the war and the withdrawal of northern Yemeni forces to 
the borders that existed between South and North Yemeni before 
they merged in 1990. 
  Mr. Yahya also called on the Kingdom to work with other 
"Arab 
brethren" to launch unconditional negotiations between the 
warring parties in Yemeni under the auspices of the Arab League. 
  The southern Yemeni official said Aden welcomes a prominent 
role for Jordan in negotiating an end to the war, especially 
that Amman hosted the signing of the Yemeni reconciliation 
accord in February. 
  Civil war erupted in Yemen on May 4 after Yemeni President 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his then Vice President 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid failed to find a peaceful settlement to their conflict. 
  Mr. al-Bid later declared an end to the merger between the 
north and the south, forming the Democratic Yemeni Republic. 
  More than three weeks of fighting have failed to produce a 
military victory for either side and observers expect a 
protracted civil war. Mr. Salih has rejected foreign mediation 
efforts, including those by the Arab League, saying the war is 
an internal Yemeni affair. 
  The official Jordanian media has taken what seems to be a 
pro-north Yemeni stand, referring to the government in Sanaa as 
the legitimate government and calling the forces of Mr. al-Bid 
secessionists. 
  Parliamentary sources said Sunday that Jordan opposes the 
fighting and supports unity, accepting whatever the Yemeni 
people decide for themselves. 
  "We will not impose anything on any side," one lawmaker 
said.

  [Excerpt] The Security Council is scheduled to discuss 
developments in Yemen. The Yemeni Government has expressed its 
resentment and stated that it viewed such deliberations as 
interference in Yemeni internal affairs. More in the following 
report: 
  Yemeni Presidential Council member 'Abd-al-'Aziz 
'Abd-al-Ghani, who arrived in Amman last night on his way to New 
York to participate in the Council deliberations, said that he 
will explain to the Council some points dealing with the 
situation in Yemen. 
  He emphasized that what is taking place in the Republic of 
Yemen is an internal affair that does not call for deliberations 
at international forums. He said what is taking place in Yemen 
is a movement carried out by elements from the Socialist Party 
against constitutional legitimacy and the elections from which 
legitimate establishments were set up. He said these elements 
want to Yemen to return to the way it was before May 1990 when 
the country was united. 
  He said his tour seeks to discuss with the friends and 
brothers how to deal with the Republic of Yemen in accordance 
with the principles of international law, which call for 
respecting sovereignty of states and noninterference in internal 
affairs. 
  The Yemeni minister [title as heard] emphasized that the 
legitimate Yemeni forces are in control of the battlefields on 
which the separatist forces are fighting. 
  In his visit to Jordan and his trip to New York, 
'Abd-al-Ghani is accompanied by Yemeni Justice Minister 
'Abdallah Ahamd Ghanim. The two Yemeni ministers were received 
upon arrival in Amman by Dr. Fawwaz Abu-al-Ghanam, acting 
minister of state for foreign affairs, and the Yemeni ambassador 
in 
Amman. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali received 
in his office at the Prime Ministry this morning Viktor 
Posuvalyuk, chief of the Near East and North African Department 
at the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the special 
representative of Russian President Boris Yeltsin. 
  During the meeting, they discussed bilateral relations and 
regional issues, including the peace process. The Russian 
official briefed the journalists on this meeting. He said: 
  [Begin Posuvalyuk recording, in progress] ...and I would 
like to thank his excellency the prime minister for giving 
sufficient time for our discussions, which I consider important 
ones. Discussions were divided into two parts, so to say: One 
dealt with relations between our two countries; and the other 
dealt with international and regional issues, led by the peace 
process. 
  First of all, I conveyed a salute, through his excellency 
the 
prime minister, from President Boris Yeltsin to His Majesty King 
Husayn. I also conveyed a warm salute from Russian Prime 
Minister Chernomyrdin to his excellency the prime minister. 
With regard to bilateral relations, we were agreed that they 
are generally good. We discussed some details with the 
participation of our ambassador. 
  We also agreed on the steps that we will take in the near 
future in order to consolidate these relations; I mean in 
economic and other technical fields. This is because we believe 
that political dialogue is under way, and that it is useful for 
both sides. 
  With regard to the peace process, we emphasized our interest 
in the Jordanian side, in Jordan's importance in the peace 
process, and in Jordan's participation in the progress of the 
Arab-Israeli negotiations on the bilateral and multilateral 
levels. We also discussed matters that are now developing in a 
dynamic manner. Thus, consultations should also be dynamic. 
With much satisfaction, I indicate that we agreed on many 
issues, and that our views were very close. [end recording]

  [Text] (J.T.) -- His Royal Highness Crown Prince Hasan said 
Tuesday [24 May] that although making peace in the Middle East 
has been arduous and fraught with dangers, "we appear to be over 
the worst" in the search for a negotiated and comprehensive 
settlement. 
  But the Crown Prince warned that much remains to be done if 
the Arab-Israeli conflict is to be resolved to the satisfaction 
of all parties. 
  "We are past the point when symbolic gestures, televised 
worldwide, carry currency," the Crown Prince said in a lecture 
he delivered at the London-based Royal United Services Institute 
for Defence Studies (RUSI), a professional body founded in 1831 
and dedicated to the study, analysis and debate of issues 
affecting defence and international security. 
  "We have arrived at the point when the substance of peace 
must be negotiated in detail; when the foundations of a new 
Middle Eastern order must be laid, block by block." 
  "In a world that is still seeking a new rationale and order 
for itself after the end of the cold war, the search for peace 
in the Middle East assumes great symbolic and practical 
importance," the Crown Prince told the audience, which included 
the Duke of Kent, patron of RUSI, as well as members and other 
invited guests comprising politicians, government and military 
officials, members of parliament, academicians and 
representatives of the British, Arabic and international media 
in London. 
  But "peace cannot be piecemeal," the Crown Prince said. "It 
must be comprehensive, and it must be just, if it is to be 
lasting. All must be given the chance, and the tools, to play 
their part in building a new Middle Eastern order." 
  "Jordan signed a common agenda for peace talks with Israel 
last year," the Crown prince said. "The common agenda 
represents a significant achievement, but it is no more than a 
first step on the road to peace. There is still much to be 
achieved, and much to be negotiated, before the attainment of a 
comprehensive peace. Jordan is prepared to enter a peace treaty 
with Israel, once the issues listed in the agenda have been 
fully discussed and settled to the satisfaction of all. We seek 
to strike a balance between the need to address the agenda items 
on the one hand and the need to implement interim agreements and 
arrangements to sustain the momentum of peace on the other." 
  After the lecture, Prince Hasan responded to questions 
related to Arab intelligentsia and the media, anti-Semitism, 
racial discrimination and extremism. 
  Voicing his rejection of all forms of anti-Semitism and 
extremism, the Prince called for solutions to humanitarian 
issues through agreements by the followers of the three 
monotheistic religions in a spirit of equality and co-existence. 
  Following is the full text of the lecture which was entitled 
"Making Peace in the Middle East": 
  It is an honour and a pleasure to address the Royal United 
Services Institute on the complex topic of "Making Peace in the 
Middle East." Many of you are familiar with the study and 
logistics of warfare as well as the politics of making peace. I 
am in a position to assure you that the later is far more 
difficult to achieve. It is simple to wage war but it is not so 
easy to conclude a just and lasting peace. Our experience in 
the Middle East has shown that making peace is constantly 
fraught with hidden dangers. The search for peace in the region 
has been arduous and at times intractable. I am pleased to 
state that we appear to be over the worst. 
  I have come before you today to speak of Jordan's quest for 
peace. I will speak of peace in the Middle East, for that is my 
region and my history. But what I say of my region holds true 
for other regions, other situations. The Middle East is 
strategically located at the cross-roads of the world. In a 
world that is still seeking a new rationale and order for itself 
after the end of the cold war, the search for peace in the 
Middle East assumes great symbolic and practical importance. 
For if the peoples of my region can find the will and the 
courage to live together, then surely no conflict is insoluble. 
  The events of the past year have opened the door to peace 
in the Middle East. The mutual recognition of the Palestine 
Liberation Organisation) PLO and Israel gave the region an 
unprecedented opportunity to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict, 
a conflict that has taken its toll on us all. The recent 
implementation of their historic agreement over Gaza and Jericho 
is another step in the right direction. But we must be under no 
illusions about the difficulty of our task. Future war must be 
made inconceivable, the wounds that have kept Arab and Israeli 
apart must somehow be healed. 
  There is a tendency in the news media to focus on the most 
recent and dramatic developments in discussing the Middle East. 
For many of you, the massacre of Muslim worshipers that took 
place in Hebron earlier this year may be yesterday's news. But 
for those who live in the occupied territories, for those who 
have for generations lived and died with this conflict, it is 
still a matter of grave concern. It highlights the need, above 
all, for individuals on the ground to participate in the process 
of peace-making and confidence- building. Much remains to be 
done if the conflict is to be resolved. We are past the point 
when symbolic gestures, televised world-wide, carry currency. 
We have arrived at the point when the substance of peace must 
be negotiated in detail; when the foundations of a new Middle 
Eastern order must be laid, block by block. Concepts for fresh 
patterns of inter and intra-regional relationships must be 
thought out, so that they can be put in place to the benefit of 
all. This is not the stuff of headlines. But this is the stuff 
of which true peace is made. 
  Jordan has demonstrated its commitment to this kind of 
peace-making time and again over the years. Though we were not 
directly involved with the outbreak of hostilities, from the 
early days of the U.N. Gunnar Jarring mission in 1967 to the 
Madrid Conference in 1991, Jordan's approach to making peace has 
been clear and consistence. We were the first country of the 
region to advocate a negotiated settlement to the conflict. 
Jordan played an active role in formulating United Nations 
Security Council Resolution 242, which calls for an end to the 
conflict and the exchange of land for peace. Jordan has 
consistently supported the U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338 as the 
basis for peace in the Middle East. We promoted the genesis of 
the Madrid peace process, and enabled the Palestinians to assume 
their proper role, firstly by disengaging from the West Bank, 
and then by providing an umbrella for Palestinian negotiators to 
participate in the bilateral and multilateral negotiations. 
  Jordan signed a common agenda for peace talks with Israel 
last year. The common agenda represents a significant 
achievement, but it is no more than a first step on the road to 
peace. There is still much to be achieved, and much to be 
negotiated, before the attainment of a comprehensive peace. 
Jordan is prepared to enter a peace treaty with Israel, once 
the issues listed in the agenda have been fully discussed and 
settled to the satisfaction of all. We seek to strike a balance 
between the need to address the agenda items on the one hand, 
and the need to implement interim agreements and arrangements to 
sustain the momentum of peace on the other. Foremost among the 
outstanding issues are the questions of boundaries, refugees, 
security and water. 
  These issues are of the essence in the making of peace. We 
feel that there is a desperate need for a mechanism to effect 
the delineation and demarcation of our boundaries. It will be 
extremely difficult to make arrangements in other fields before 
the issues of borders and security are resolved. What sense can 
it make to speak of Jordanian and Israeli interests and concerns 
when neither "Jordan" nor "Israel" have been defined? The 
question has direct relevance to the recent events in the 
occupied territories and in Israel. Within the security 
framework, the problem of Israeli settlements must be resolved. 
Their questionable legality notwithstanding, the settlements 
represent a time-bomb which may be primed whenever a group of 
settlers, or any other organisations opposed to peace-making, 
wish to derail the peace process. Peace cannot be made and 
should not be made under such circumstances. 
  We have submitted several proposals to deal with such 
issues, and stand ready to undertake project studies in these 
fields. We believe that a Boundary Commission will help to 
resolve the issue of boundaries, and we have put forward this 
proposal as a concrete contribution to the architecture of a 
lasting regional peace. On the issue of refugees, we are 
negotiating within the parameters of international law. 
  Another issue that will demand considerable attention is the 
final status of the holy city of Jerusalem. A city revered for 
its shrines and its history by Muslims, Christians and Jews 
alike must be the ultimate symbol of peace. It is our belief 
that the religious significance of Jerusalem is such that its 
status is a truly international concern. It cannot be settled 
by Israelis and Palestinians alone, for the holy city should not 
be subject to the exclusive political control of any state. In 
determining the future of Jerusalem, Jordan believes that a 
vital distinction needs to be made between religious and 
political sovereignty. We have formulated detailed proposals to 
effect such a distinction, for we believe that a proper 
resolution to the Jerusalem question is essential in the search 
for peace. 
  We have also implemented several substantial confidence 
building measures. We have re-opened Jordanian bank branches in 
the occupied territories, in order to assist in the development 
of the Palestinian economy. To the same end, we have signed an 
economic cooperation agreement with the Palestinians, and 
participated in the training of Palestinian police officers. We 
have established the Trilateral Working Group to look at issues 
of interest to Jordan, the U.S. and Israel, and this group may 
now be promoted to ministerial level. We are optimistic about 
the prospects for a Middle East economic conference and for a 
Jordan Rift Valley development concept, but are awaiting 
positive developments in this field. We are, of course, 
prepared to consider other mechanisms to build confidence 
regionally. 
  While engaged in the substance of negotiation, Jordan has 
been considering more long-term mechanisms to deal with the 
legacies of the conflict in a reciprocal manner. We have 
evolved a vision of a new regional order under-pinned by a 
number of political and economic mechanisms that could help 
render future conflict unthinkable. 
  Attention has been focused on practical measures to generate 
a process for regional security and cooperation. The promotion 
of sustainable modes of negotiation to resolve all outstanding 
regional disputes is increasingly necessary when the ultimate 
goal is a peaceful Middle East without barriers. An example 
exists in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe 
(CSCE). While this organisation has faced its share of 
criticism, particularly in dealing with conflicts such as that 
in the former Yugoslavia, it has successfully articulated a code 
of conduct for times of peace. This is precisely what the 
Middle East requires. We in Jordan believe that this conceptual 
framework can contribute to lasting peace in the region, and we 
have accordingly long called for a Helsinki Process, a 
conference on Security and Cooperation, for the Middle East 
(CSCME). 
  It should be made clear that the CSC process is not 
envisaged 
as a substitute for the peace process, but as a natural 
compliment to it, and one that can remain in place to the 
benefit of all after the achievement of a negotiated peace. We 
do not propose the wholesale adoption of a one-off blueprint, 
but the adaptation of a flexible paradigm. We are entirely open 
to alternatives, so long as they can provide us with what we 
desperately need: neutral and low-key fora at which the common 
and inter-connected challenges of security and cooperation can 
be discussed in a global idiom. 
  Within the context of a regional security regime the size, 
role and function of armed forces in the individual states of 
the region are likely to undergo radical changes. The 
transformation would be in favour of peace keeping. Jordan's 
armed forces have led the way in this respect. Our personnel 
are already serving in this capacity under the U.N. command as 
far afield as Mozambique, Liberia and in former Yugoslavia. 
More significantly, Israel's military superiority and the 
organic bond established with the U.S. through the doubtful 
syndrome of "arms for flexibility," or "hardware for software," 
which was devised by Henry Kissinger, would have to be 
considered and reassessed under a regional security system. 
Regional security must be so both in scope and substance. As 
shared values and aims take root, the notion of favoritism will 
become increasingly invidious and increasingly insupportable. 
  Clearly the region comprises a diverse collection of 
peoples, who nevertheless share many historical experiences and 
perspectives. The European Union has conceptually divided the 
Middle East into three main areas: The Maghreb, the Mashreq and 
Turkey. From Jordan's point of view, at the epicentre of the 
region, the Middle East straddles and extends beyond the 
frontiers of Europe and Asia. It is integrally tied to both 
continents, with the Mediterranean serving as a link, rather 
than a barrier. In the long term, the future of the Middle East 
and that of Europe cannot be separated. In this ever more 
inter-dependent world, the interests of our two regions are 
increasingly at one. It would therefore be wise, in formulating 
strategies for the future of the region, to consider the 
European experience; for we in Jordan believe that the Middle 
East can have no future unless it evolves a global vision, 
backed up by subregional and regional instruments. The next step 
would therefore be to consider which instruments would be 
appropriate. 
  A free-trade zone across the Middle East, allowing for the 
free movement of labour, goods, capital and services, would 
represent a significant achievement to this end. Arrangements 
for a Middle East Free Trade Agreement--a MEFTA along the lines 
of EFTA or NAFTA-- would allow the region to play a more 
creative role in the world economy. In aspiring to this goal, 
it will be necessary to consider the freedom of movement of all 
factors of production. In this context, a dialogue on the 
rights of migrant labour must be a vital prerequisite; for the 
existence of surplus labour in the north, and capital in the 
south, immediately suggests a viable regional trade regime. 
  Of course, many outstanding issues must be resolved before 
such a vision can be realised. Even under conditions of peace, 
the disparity between the Israeli economy and those of the other 
regional parties, particularly the core parties to the 
Arab-Israeli conflict, demands appropriate measures to fashion a 
balanced relationship in a graduated manner. The examples of 
Spain and Portugal within the EU are worth considering in this 
regard. 
  A GATT-EU approach may be the best way to deal with the 
economic legacies of the conflict, and to put the region on a 
viable, sustainable economic footing. Jordan believes that in 
seeking to evolve a healthy trade and investment regime, the 
experience of other countries--such as the Zone Franche 
arrangements between Geneva and France--will be invaluable. The 
European Commission has recently stressed the need for a common 
regional vision as a basis for cooperation in the Middle East. 
In a communication on this subject, it states: 
  "Partnership requires balanced economic development. If 
cooperation is to succeed it is essential to reduce excessive 
disparities in income levels between potential partners in the 
region." It adds that: 
  "Cooperation should go in two directions: the pooling of 
common capacities and the tackling of common 
problems...implying, at some stage, freedom of movement for 
goods, services, capital and labour." 
  It is clear, then, that international investment in 
development projects which serve the region and its peoples is 
the way forward. it is equally important that such projects be 
founded upon sound concepts, and that they receive the support 
of international financial institutions, governments and 
multinational corporations alike. A basketing approach, 
covering human cooperation, resource cooperation and security, 
must be evolved. Peace requires an enduring structure that can 
tackle the over-arching problems of the economies of the region: 
disparities created by conflict, over-extended public sectors, 
addiction to aid and oil revenues. An economic framework is 
needed to deal with such problems. 
  Many other instruments could play a part in forging such a 
framework. For example, regional bodies and charters are needed 
to ensure equity in resources-related areas such as energy and 
water; while incentives for local sustainable development 
programmes can support policies that guarantee a future for all. 
A regional debt sinking fund, and a bank for Middle East 
reconstruction and development, will promote stable and open 
financial practices, improving the chances for the region to 
play a dynamic part in the world economy. 
  The concept of reconstruction is particularly vital. The 
Arab-Israeli conflict has exacted a severe toll on the region. 
With the promise of peace in the region, the international 
community looks increasingly towards the occupied territories. 
Jordan fully supports the effort to give the Palestinian people 
the tools they need to realise their historic dreams. We will 
do everything in our power to ensure the success of arrangements 
for Palestinian interim self-government. But although the 
Palestine question has always been the core of the Arab-Israeli 
conflict, the entire region has suffered. Vast debt burdens 
have been accumulated as a direct result of the conflict; 
unimaginable demographic strains have been imposed on countries 
with scarce resources. Peace, then, cannot be piecemeal. To 
use those famous words, I put it to you that peace must be 
comprehensive, and it must be just, if it is to be lasting. All 
must be given the chance, and the tools, to play their part in 
building a new Middle Eastern order.

  [Text] Jordan constitutes a strategic extension of the 
Palestinian economy. This was stressed by the Palestinian side 
during its meeting with the Jordanian side at the Amman Chamber 
of Commerce this morning. The two sides discussed ways of 
establishing and enhancing Jordanian-Palestinian economic 
cooperation in the fields of trade, industry, agriculture, 
tourism, hotel management, finance, services, transportation, 
and contracts. The two sides also discussed the possibility of 
establishing joint companies to market Palestinian and Jordanian 
products and promote goods in foreign and local markets. 
  The two sides also tackled ways of attracting capital and 
investment companies in order to create a Palestinian-Jordanian 
economic entity by establishing joint industrial, trade, 
agricultural, housing, services, and touristic projects in the 
interest of both sides. They then reviewed joint coordination 
to unify standards and specifications and establish the proposed 
standards and specifications center in Palestine that will fully 
coordinate with the standards and specifications center in 
Jordan. 
  [Begin 'Abd-al-Rahman Abu-Layl, head of the Palestinian 
Chamber of Industry, recording] We have come here to coordinate 
with our brothers in Amman the future economic march in the 
interest of both the Palestinian and Jordanian economies and to 
establish joint cooperation. We view Jordan as a strategic 
extension of the Palestinian economy. Therefore, doors will be 
opened, and we will have an outlet to the Arab world from our 
beloved Jordan. So, we would like to lay the groundwork for 
building that economy. We are now talking on behalf of the 
Palestinian businessmen and the Palestinian private sector that 
will carry out that duty. [end recording] 
  The Jordanian-Palestinian conference on development and 
investment, which will be held under the patronage of His 
Highness Crown Prince Hasan, was one of the most important 
proposals made by both sides during today's meeting--a 
conference which will be a manifestation of economic cooperation 
between the two countries. More than 300 people will be invited 
to attend the conference, in addition to both sides' officials.

  [Text] Amman--The General Secretary of Parliament Salih 
al-Zu'bi has been relieved of his duties and appointed an 
advisor at the Prime Ministry, informed sources told the JORDAN 
TIMES Sunday. 
  The sources said the Cabinet decided to remove Dr. Zu'bi 
from 
his post during a session Saturday, but has not yet agreed on a 
replacement for him. 
  Dr. al-Zu'bi who had earlier worked as an ambassador, took 
up 
his post at Parliament in 1990. 
  Sources said among the candidates to replace Dr. Zu'bi are 
Helmi al-Sarabi, a legal advisor at the Prime Ministry and Hakam 
Khayr, who is the official spokesman of al-Watan Party. 
  Mr. Khayr's affiliation with al-Watan, however, could weaken 
his chances to land the job as it is preferred that the general 
secretary of Parliament is an independent figure, the sources 
said. 
  "We hope that the newcomer would be able to redress the 
deterioration in support services provided to deputies by the 
General Secretariat," one lawmaker told the JORDAN TIMES. 
  The deputy said there has been a noticeable regression in 
the 
quality of administrative services awarded to lawmakers, which 
reflected on their ability to deal effectively with issues of 
concern to the public. 
  Other parliamentary sources echoed the lawmaker in 
expressing 
dissatisfaction with the performance of the General Secretariat, 
saying they hoped the change would bring about an improvement in 
the services it is supposed to extend to lawmakers.

  [Text] Formal talks between the prime minister, Ms. 
Benazir Bhutto, and the Nepalese prime minister, Mr. Girija 
Prasad Koirla, were held at the Singhe Darbar in Kathmandu 
today. The talks, which lasted over 90 minutes, were held in an 
atmosphere of cordiality, reminiscent of constructive and 
meaningful cooperation existing between Pakistan and Nepal. 
Pakistan Television's representative, Abdul Wahid, reports from 
Kathmandu that regional and international issues, including 
Kashmir, figured in the talks. 
  The two leaders also discussed bilateral relations with 
particular emphasis on economic cooperation. They agreed on 
steps to enhance cooperation in several fields, including trade 
and culture. Ms. Benazir Bhutto was assisted by the foreign 
minister, Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali; the minister of state for 
finance, Maqdum Shahabuddin; Special assistant to the prime 
minister on social sector, Begum Shahnaz Wazir Ali; the foreign 
secretary, Mr. Najmuddin Sheikh; and Pakistan's ambassador to 
Nepal, Mr. Mohammad Nasir Mian. The Nepalese prime minister, 
Mr. Girija Prasad Koirala, was assisted by a high-level team 
which included some cabinet ministers and economic experts. 
  Talking to newsmen after the talks, Ms. Benazir Bhutto 
described her discussions with the Nepalese prime minister as 
useful. 
  [Begin Bhutto recording] We discussed regional and 
international issues. And we also discussed how to improve 
cooperation. We must be holding the joint commission on an 
annual basis and we are also going to be holding an industrial 
exhibition here. So, Nepali businessmen can see what goods we 
have in Pakistan and we are going to have a cultural exchange 
office for (?our two nations). [end recording] 
  Speaking at a civic reception hosted by the citizens of 
Kathmandu this afternoon, the prime minister stressed the need 
of devotion and hard work for the economic uplift in the 
developing country. A very warm and colorful reception was 
extended to the prime minister and members of her entourage when 
they arrived at the Municipal Hall. The mayor of Kathmandu, Mr. 
P.L. Singh, greeted the distinguished guests. The prime 
minister was profusely garlanded. The prime minister was 
enthusiastically greeted as she entered the hall. The mayor of 
Kathmandu welcomed the prime minister on her historic visit. 
The mayor then presented the key of Kathmandu city to the prime 
minister. Speaking on the occasion, Ms. Benazir Bhutto said the 
people of Pakistan and Nepal who are fellow members of SAARC 
[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation] countries 
have common struggle for parliamentary democracy and democratic 
institutions. She reminded that the population living in the 
developing countries have to strive for achieving the cherished 
goals of economic betterment of their masses. She thanked the 
people of Kathmandu for extending a rousing reception to her and 
the members of her delegation and said this reflects the 
sentiments of Nepalese people for their Pakistani brethren. 
  The president of the Nepalese Congress, Mr. Krishnanath 
Prasad Bhattarai, called on the prime minister, Ms. Benazir 
Bhutto, in Kathmandu yesterday. During the meeting, the prime 
minister briefed the president of the Nepalese Congress about 
the democratic process in Pakistan. The prime minister also 
reiterated the unflinching commitment of her government for 
democracy and the growth of democratic institutions. She said 
her government is also undertaking steps to bring positive 
changes in the socioeconomic structure of her country. Mr. 
Bhattarai paid tributes to the prime minister for her struggle 
for democracy and the rule of law. 
  The chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal and the leader 
of the opposition in the Nepalese parliament, Mr. Manmohan 
Adhikari, also called on the prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, 
in Kathmandu. The leader of the Nepalese opposition lauded the 
prime minister of Pakistan for her deep commitment toward 
democracy and human rights. The prime minister, while 
reciprocating the gesture, informed the Nepalese leader that 
Pakistan wants to see democracy in South Asia and the growth of 
human rights in the region.

  [Text] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has said 
the resolution of the Kashmir issue is vital to complete the 
charter of the Pak-India partition plan. She was addressing a 
news conference in Kathmandu this afternoon prior to her 
departure for home. Replying to a question on plebiscite in 
Kashmir, the prime minister said: 
  [Begin Bhutto recording] (?Already) Pakistan made its demand 
for plebiscite. And you know who else agreed to plebiscite? 
Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of India. And you know who 
else agreed to plebiscite? The entire international community 
in the United Nations. So what we are saying is that why this 
subcontinent gives rapt attention just because India and 
Pakistan cannot deal with the problem which we have inherited 
from partition. [sentence as heard] So, we are saying let us 
solve that. Let us solve that under the Simla agreement and let 
us in the light of UN resolution (?if we cannot do it 
bilaterally). So let us do it multilaterally, but let us find a 
political solution. I noted the Indian scene that this is the 
Pakistani inspired uprising. But that is not so. There is no 
difference in this uprising than the difference wherein the 
people of Nepal rose up against the Rana rulers, for instance. 
So nobody can quench the desire of freedom because it is the 
part of the way I think; it is the people of a country or the 
people of a society. [sentence as heard] If they rise up, 
nobody can do anything about it. [end recording] 
  To another question, she said her visit to Nepal will herald 
a new era of cooperation between Pakistan and Nepal. 
  A warm send off was given to the prime minister when she 
left 
Kathmandu today for Islamabad. The Nepalese prime minister, Mr. 
Girija Prasad Koirala, bade farewell to Ms. Benazir Bhutto at 
the Tribhuvan Airport. Also present to see off the prime 
minister of Pakistan were members of the Nepalese cabinet, the 
mayor of Kathmandu, senior officials of the government, 
diplomats based in the Nepalese capital, and members of the 
Pakistani community. An impressive guard of honor was presented 
to Ms. Benazir Bhutto. National anthems of the two countries 
were also played on the occasion. Before boarding the aircraft, 
the prime minister and members of her entourage deeply thanked 
the Nepalese prime minister and other officials of his 
government for the warm hospitality during their stay in 
Kathmandu. 
  The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, called on his 
majesty 
King Birendra of Nepal at Narenhiti Royal Palace in Kathmandu 
last night. The talks between his majesty and the prime 
minister lasted over half an hour. Later, King Birendra hosted 
a dinner in honor of Ms. Benazir Bhutto at the palace. The 
dinner was also attended by Queen Aishwarya; the prime minister 
of Nepal, Mr. Girija Prasad Koirala; and members of the prime 
minister's entourage. 
  The prime minister is now back in Islamabad.

  [Text] Islamabad, May 26 -- Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto 
said on Thursday that Islamabad had given counter proposals in 
response to U.S. suggestion that Pakistan should allow 
non-intrusive inspection of its nuclear installations. 
  "The question of non-intrusive inspection is an American 
proposal and we have given counter-proposals based on a regional 
solution," Ms Bhutto said at a news conference on her return 
from Nepal. 
  She was asked to comment on a recent statement of Foreign 
Minister Sardar Assef Ahmed Ali in which he had said that 
Pakistan was ready to allow non-intrusive inspection of its 
nuclear installations. 
  Denying that the foreign ministor had made any such offer, 
she said: "Pakistan will not accept any uniluteral solution or 
proposal." 
  Questioned whether President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari would 
be discussing the nuclear issue with American officials during 
his current visit to the United States, the Prime Minister said 
though the President's visit was a private one, "we are using 
this occasion to have informal talks with U.S. officials and to 
explain Pakistan's position on the nuclear issue." 
  Ms Bhutto said she would also be visiting the United States 
by the end of this year. "I hope it will be a substantive 
visit." 
  The Prime Minister said the Pressler Amendment, which debars 
Pakistan from getting U.S. military and economic aid, was a 
discriminatory law, "and we want it should go." 
  Ms Bhutto said Pakistan shared US concern over nuclear 
proliteration, "but we feel the Pressler Amendment is a veto in 
the hand of India." 
  She said Pakistan and the United States were cooperating in 
anti-narcotics campaign and defence of human rights, and added 
that the two could move in the nuclear non-proliferation field 
provided a regional approach on this issue was agreed upon. 
  Pakistan, she said, was anxious to improve its relations 
with 
the United States, but hastened to add that it did not want to 
do so just for having F-16 fighter aircraft. 
  "We don't want one-dimensional relationship. It should be a 
multi-dimensional one," she asserted. 
  Ms Bhutto said Pakistan had supported America during Soviet 
invasion of Afghanistan. "We have defended freedom in 
Afghanistan and we are cooperating with the United Nations in 
its peacekeeping preparations in Somalia and other parts of the 
world," she said, while calling for closer relationship between 
the two countries. 
  She said her government was building Pakistan as a modern 
Islamic state where rule of law would be supreme. She said a 
society would be built where women would have an equal role to 
play. A women's police station had already been set up and 
women's courts would also be established, she said. 
  Answering a question, Ms Bhutto said she wanted the 
opposition to cooperate with the government on three main issues 
-- Pakistan-U.S. relations, Pakistan-India ties and the nuclear 
issue. "On these three subjects we (the government and the 
opposition) should have a unified stand," she said.

  [Text] Islamabad, May 26 -- Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto 
on Thursday barred her cabinet members from issuing any 
statement on the country's nuclear programme. 
  "I will direct the ministers not to speak on the nuclear 
issue or answer any question in this regard," Ms. Bhutto said 
at a Press conference. 
  She said the nuclear issue was a specialised subject and 
some 
nonspecialists were spreading confusion by making statements or 
replying to questions asked by reporters. 
  Complaining that some newspapers twisted statements in this 
regard, Ms Bhutto said that from now onward, no one except 
herself would speak directly on the issue. "Even the foreign 
minister will give a written statement on the subject so that no 
one can twist it," she said and added that if any cabinet member 
had to reply to any question on the issue he should seek its 
answer from the foreign minister. 
  "Statements are printed to create confusion and that's why 
we 
say enough is enough," she added. 
  Ms Bhutto said that first a statement on rolling back 
Pakistan's nuclear programme was published and, though the 
government denied it, it was made an issue. "They want to trap 
us by (printing) such statements." 
  The Prime Minister regretted that every Tom, Dick and Harry 
had become an expert on this specialised subject. "They use 
terms like freezing, capping and rolling back, so loosely that 
Pakistan's interest is hurt."

  [Text] The president, Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari, 
has reiterated that Pakistan's nuclear program is peaceful, and 
we have taken a conscious decision not to use our nuclear 
capability for weapon production unless our security is 
threatened. Addressing the Pakistani community in New York, he 
categorically rejected any inspection of Pakistan's nuclear 
facilities, saying that the government's policy in this 
connection is very clear. The president said Pakistan's nuclear 
program enjoys national consensus, and it is not possible for 
any government or leader to accept anything imposed from outside 
contrary to the wishes of the people of Pakistan. He said that 
reports accusing the government has agreed to open up its 
facility for any kind of inspections are baseless and frivolous. 
[sentence as heard] 
  The president said Pakistan has told the United States that 
no unilateral solution could be imposed on Pakistan. Any 
solution to the nonproliferation problem in South Asian region 
has to be resolved in the regional context. He said that 
Pakistan has proposed several concrete plans to achieve nuclear 
nonproliferation in the region, but India has rejected all of 
them. Under the circumstances, the United States or the world 
at large could not expect realistically that Pakistan would 
accept any unilateral obligation. 
  Replying to a question, he debunked the reports that 
Pakistan 
has entered into any secret talks with the United States on the 
nonproliferation issue. He said Pakistan is pursuing a quiet 
diplomacy, but not secret diplomacy, as has been done by others. 
Referring to his talks with the U.S. Administration, the 
president expressed the confidence that these talks would yield 
good results.

  [Text] Quetta, May 30 -- Pakistan security forces have 
launched an attack inside Afghanistan to get its ten captives 
released. 
  They are being kept hostage by an Afghan gun-runner Mullah 
Bockeri, reliable sources said here Monday. 
  The attack coincided with the recent two-day visit of 
Federal 
Interior Minister General (Retd) Naseerullah Babar to Noshki, a 
north-western bordering town, 140 kilometres off here. 
  The sources said that assault at Tazai Rabat (a sub-tehsil) 
in District Shahjoi of Zabul Province -- the stronghold of 
Mullah Salam Rocketi, has sofar been unsuccessful because 
Sulemankhail and Tarak tribesmen from the neighbouring Ghazni 
Province have dispatched reinforcements to repulse the Frontier 
Corps' (FC) offensive. 
  Sources said that the heavy exchange of fire had been 
continuing for the last two days but there was no report of any 
casualty from either side. 
  Mullah Salam is holding two Chinese engineers, five 
employees 
of Balochistan development Authority (BDA), Deputy Commissioner 
Ziarat, his driver and gunman as hostages for the last several 
months seeking ransom and return of his "two Stinger missiles" 
captured by the FC from his residence inside Pakistan in January 
last year. 
  In retaliation Mullah Salam's armed men abducted 30 FC 
personnel including a major after exchange of fire and taken 
them to Zabul. The soldiers were released after payment of 
ransom and a promise for returning his Stinger missiles. 
  Last month Salam released two BDA employees on the pursuance 
of a spiritual leader but had set conditions for release of 
other hostages. 
  Sources said the FC's attack could provoke the Afghan 
gun-runner who might harm the hostages.

  [Text] Over the past 24 hours 131 rockets were fired into 
residential areas of Kabul. According to a report of the Kabul 
garrison command, the rockets were fired into the city from the 
directions of Balahesar and Maranjan Hill. As a result four 
defenseless residents of the city were martyred and 10 others 
were injured. 
  According to another report, positions of the Islamic army 
were attacked yesterday evening west of Kabul. A security 
source considered the internecine clashes of Hezb-e Wahdat over 
the appointment of the future party leader as the reason for the 
attack. The report adds that the adventurist section of Hezb-e 
Wahdat wants to hide its internal problems from the public by 
fanning conflict between the Islamic Army and Hezb-e Wahdat. 
However, Islamic Army units have been emphatically instructed 
to exercise forbearance before such provocations.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "President Clinton's Disclosures </F>
on Bosnia"] 
  [Text] In an address at the graduation ceremony held at the 
U.S. Naval Academy on 25 May, President Bill Clinton said that 
he was opposed to lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia's Islamic 
people. Describing any move to lift the arms embargo as a blow 
to peace, Clinton stressed that the United States has to work in 
harmony with its allies to end the war in that country. 
  According to political observers, President Clinton's views 
have brought to light the conflicting approaches of U.S. 
officials on the fighting in Bosnia. The political observers 
are convinced that the reason for their conflicting approaches 
is that they care more about their country's vital interests in 
the Balkans than the fate of Bosnia's Islamic people. 
  The U.S. Administration has disclosed in the past that the 
United States does not wish to intervene in the Balkan region 
because it does not have vital interests in that part of the 
world. However, it moved to support the Islamic people in 
Bosnia to create vital interests for itself when the fighting 
spread in that country. Obviously, Washington was aware that the 
Serbs are Russia's traditional allies. It was also aware that 
the Croat people sided with Germany. Therefore, 
Bosnia-Herzegovina was the most appropriate door to the Balkan 
region. However, the United States was unable to effectively 
support the Bosnian people. Consequently, it tried to support 
them only through propaganda statements, without moving to 
seriously intervene in the war. 
  Clinton's disclosures indicate that the White House 
officials 
do not wish to help Bosnia's people regain their country. 
Instead, they prefer to deceive them to create the conditions 
they need to strengthen Washington's position in that country. 
They also prefer to maintain their special relations with 
Britain, Russia, and France. 
  Understanding why Clinton has ignored the U.S. Senate's 
ostentatious wish to have the arms embargo on Bosnia's Islamic 
people lifted will be easier when all that is considered. 
Furthermore, it has become obvious that Washington does not want 
Bosnia's Islamic people to defend themselves against the 
merciless Serbian attacks.

  [Text] Tehran, May 28, IRNA -- The refusal of the British 
Foreign Office to comment on the report carried by the daily 
GUARDIAN Saturday that a ranking Iranian diplomat in London has 
been ordered to go home, indicates a new provocation on the part 
of the British Government against Islamic Iran. 
  A spokesman of the British Foreign Ministry contacted by 
IRNA 
Saturday refused to confirm or deny the report saying simply 
that the content of the talks between the Iranian charge 
d'affaires in London, Gholam-Reza Ansari, and Deputy Minister of 
Foreign Affairs of Britain Douglas Hogg was meant to remain 
undisclosed. 
  Experts on relations between the two countries say in the 
event the report by THE GUARDIAN should be true the British 
Government might have to expect a similar action by Iran. 
  They believe that the British Government in view of its 
abortive propaganda campaign against Iran, is trying to take a 
new provocative step against the Islamic Republic. 
  In the opinion of Iran-Britain watchers, London intends to 
exploit the meeting between the two for propaganda purposes. 
Early this month a section of the British press in a 
simultaneous move without any documents to substantiate their 
claim, alleged that the Islamic Republic of Iran was backing the 
Irish Republican Army (IRA). 
  The provocative insinuation by the British press, however, 
was hardly heeded by the media elsewhere in Europe. 
  Iran-Britain watchers say under the circumstances any 
hostile 
action by the British Government towards the Islamic Republic 
may entail a stronger reaction by Iran which the Britons do not 
consider to be in their best interest. 
  International relations consultant Sadeq Azimi says the 
measure by the British Government might be simply a device for 
burying its scandalous bugging of the Iranian embassy in London 
under fresh anti-Iran propaganda. He says any indiscreet action 
by the British Government might entail ruinous consequences for 
the British Government. 
  A sophisticated bugging device planted by the British Secret 
Service in the Iranian embassy was recently discovered during 
repairs.

  [Text] Tehran, May 27, IRNA -- Majlis Vice-Speaker Hojjat 
ol-Eslam Hasan Rowhani here today expressed surprise that 
certain countries are always trying to kindle war and disputes 
in the region. "I am asking the hijaz government that how 
fratricide in Yemen might benefit you," he questioned as he 
referred to the Saudi provocations in the on-going civil war in 
Yemen. [sentence as received] "Arabia cannot tolerate a 
powerful country in its neighbourhood according to a historical 
logic," he added. 
  Saudi Arabia supported the Iraqi regime in its war against 
Iran (1980-88), and supported Kuwait in the Persian Gulf war, he 
said, however, documents were disclosed later on which showed 
that Saudi Arabia did not like the disputes to be settled. 
  Criticizing Riyadh policies in the region, Rowhani advised 
the Saudi rulers to take lessons from bitter experiences of the 
past, and choose the path of peace, stability and brotherhood. 
"Iran has always extended friendship and brotherhood hand to 
her neighbours within the framework of Islam and international 
regulations." 
  Pointing to the Saudi helplessness to carry out a correct 
planning and to guarantee the security of the hajj pilgrims, 
Rowhani said administration of a ceremony in a holy site, where 
2.5 million pilgrims are present, is a heavy burden on Saudi 
Arabia. 
  "We knew from the very beginning that the Saudi 
administration with all its money and massive presence of 
foreigners in that country, would not be able to administer the 
hajj ceremony in a proper way," said the vice-speaker. 
  He said the death of the hajj pilgrims in Mina is not only 
limited to the current year. Whenever there is a crowd of 
pilgrims, the Saudi police think that a demonstration is to be 
organized, and therefore, attack the people with anti-riot 
equipment, causing multiple death of the pilgrims. 
  "If the Saudi police did not involve in the Mina incident 
this year, the number of victims did not exceed 30," he 
regretted. 
  Reiterating the previous proposal by Iran on the 
administration of the hajj ceremonies by the Islamic countries, 
he said if Saudi Arabia is not ready to accept the proposal, at 
least it can accept help by volunteer countries. 
  "We are sure that if we help Saudi Arabia, hajj pilgrims 
will 
not lose their lives to this extent, and the ceremony will be 
held more appropriately," Rowhani said.

  [Text] The Saudi Arabian Government has opposed a visit by 
Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Reyshahri, the representative of 
the supreme jurisconsult [Khamene'i] and the supervisor of the 
Iranian hajj pilgrims, from holy Mecca to holy Medina. In a 
written message, Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Reyshahri has 
appointed Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati as deputy supervisor of the 
Iranian hajj pilgrims and official in charge of the exalted 
leadership's mission in Mecca. 
  Earlier the Arabian hajj minister, in a letter addressed to 
Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Reyshahri, announced the Saudi 
Government's opposition to a visit from Mecca to Medina by the 
representative of the supreme jurisconsult. The Saudi Government 
agreed to the presence of the representative of the supreme 
jurisconsult and supervisor of the the Iranian hajj pilgrims 
until the end of the hajj rites, as well as the presence of 
Iranians in Arabia, in its earlier agreements with Iran.

<F P=106> [Commentary by News Research and Commentary Group] </F>
  [Text] Although three weeks have passed since the Yemeni 
crisis began, no solutions have been found to end the conflicts 
in that country. In the most recent effort to resolve this 
crisis, the five members of the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council 
and Egypt have proposed in a letter to the UN Security Council 
president that the council examine the situation in Yemen. 
Within this framework, a resolution has been proposed to be 
discussed by the Security Council. In this proposed resolution 
an immediate cease-fire between the two conflicting sides and a 
ban on the dispatch of any type of war materiel and arms to 
Yemen have been requested. The UN secretary general also has 
been requested to send a fact-finding mission to Yemen and to 
pave the way for the resumption of talks between the two 
conflicting factions. The UN Security Council is expected to 
begin examining the Yemeni crisis on Tuesday. 
  The proposal by the six Arab countries to the UN Security 
Council shows that their attempts to end the conflicts in Yemen 
are at an impasse. Despite their efforts, the Arab 
countries--both individually and within the framework of the 
Arab League--have been unable to prevent the political 
differences in Yemen from turning into a civil war. This 
inability has been attributed to the differences of opinion 
among the Arab countries on the Yemeni crisis. 
  Having the Yemeni problem discussed by the Security Council 
automatically grants an international dimension to this crisis. 
While it is a very welcome development for the leaders of south 
Yemen, it causes concern among the leaders in the north. Since 
the outset of the crisis in Yemen, the leaders in the south have 
constantly sought ways to internationalize the problem in a bid 
to inflict pressures on the north. The north has referred to 
the crisis as a domestic issue and has urged foreign countries 
and international organizations to not become involved. 
  When the southerners declared their separation from the 
north 
and the formation of an independent country, the 
internationalization of the problem granted them the opportunity 
to strengthen their bases. Since this weakens Yemen's unity, it 
is a source of great concern for the northerners who want unity 
to be preserved.

  [Text] Cairo, 28 May (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has 
stated that Egypt and a number of Gulf states have submitted a 
request to the UN Security Council to discuss the situation in 
Yemen and the ongoing fighting there. He pointed out that a 
cease-fire is important to stop the deteriorating situation in 
that country. He noted that all parties, including Arab and 
international ones, are interested in halting the continuing 
bloodshed in Yemen without prejudice to the political situation 
in that country. 
  Musa emphasized that what is important now is to reach a 
cease-fire in Yemen because this is in the interest of both the 
Arabs and the Yemenis. A cease-fire, he added, would allow for 
a return to negotiations and safeguard Yemeni unity. He noted 
that the continued bloodshed will certainly hurt Yemen's unity 
and future.

foster an atmosphere to resume dialogue and encourage stability 
inside this fraternal Arab country. 
  Basindwah said that he conveyed an oral message from 
President Salih on the leadership's stance in Sanaa vis-a-vis 
the ongoing events in Yemen. He said that the Yemeni people 
greatly appreciate President Mubarak's deep concern to stop the 
bloodshed in Yemen. He said that a cease-fire must be reached 
within the framework of recognizing Yemen's unity and abolishing 
any resolution to secede because it is illegal and to have a 
recourse to the Yemeni Republic constitution. 
  Basindwash said that any measure taken by the Security 
Council regarding the events in Yemen must emphasize the 
importance of safeguarding the Yemeni unity and decomcratic 
development, particularly because the general elections that 
were held in Yemen on 17 April were the object of world 
admiration. He stressed that Egypt is a big, leading, and 
pioneering country in the whole Arab region, noting that 
President Mubarak gave us advice and instructions that we 
appreciated and were eager to listen to. If we do not seek 
Egypt's help, whose else can we seek? 
  Answering a question on imposing unity by force in Yemen, 
Basindwah said that unity had been established voluntarily in 
1990, therefore unity already exists, so how we can impose a 
thing that already exists. He stressed that the party that 
resorted to force is the one who wants secession. Here Musa 
interrupted and stressed that regardless of who started the war 
the point on which we agree is that the continuing use of force 
is not in the interest of Yemen, its unity, or stability. 
  Basindwah pointed out that they did not demand that all 
Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leaders surrender but some of them, 
especially 'Ali Salim al-Bid, because he is the person primarily 
responsible for current events in Yemen. He said: We still 
recognize the YSP and wish to continue the dialogue with the 
moderate leaders and those who believe in Yemeni unity. 
  Responding to proposals put forward by certain parties to 
form a confederation as the best solution for the coming stage, 
Basindwah stressed that Yemen has never been two countries or 
two peoples. Proof of this is that when two states existed in 
Yemen, they were called the two parts of Yemen. Confederation, 
he said, is out of the question because there are no minorities 
in Yemen and but one Muslim Arab people. 
  Musa stressed that Egypt demands first a cease-fire and from 
there things can proceed on a positive rather than negative 
course. He noted the role of the Security Council's proposed 
meeting on a cease-fire resolution, to which Sanaa has agreed. 
He pointed out that safeguarding unity through war is a losing 
game and that unity itself is a demand that cannot be criticized 
or assailed and must be preserved through the Yemeni people's 
freely accepting this unity. Musa said that the dialogue will 
take place among the parties of the crisis and if Egypt is asked 
to play a role, we will be ready but we will not impose it.

  [Text] Cairo, 28 May (MENA)--Mr. 'Abd-al-Malik Sa'id, the 
charge d'affaires of the Yemeni Embassy in Cairo, has stated 
that operations at the embassy are back to normal today. He 
said that all employees and diplomats have entered their offices 
and have resumed their duties after an understanding was reached 
with the former ambassador, 'Abd-al-Jalil Ghaylan, to allow them 
to enter. 
  Ambassador 'Abd-al-Jalil Ghaylan, a northerner who supports 
the Yemeni Socialist Party of the south, had shut the embassy 
doors last Wednesday and prevented the staff from entering to 
protest Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah's 
decision to dismiss him and appoint the charge d'affaires, a 
northerner, to run the embassy's affairs. 
  'Abd-al-Malik Sa'id said in a statement to MENA that the 
monthly allowances of Yemeni students studying in Cairo were 
disbursed today. These allowances were supposed to be disbursed 
last week. In addition, consular services are being provided for 
the Yemeni community in Egypt. 
  He added that former Ambassador 'Abd-al-Jalil Ghaylan is 
still at his home, which is located above the embassy. The new 
permanent representative to the Arab League, Ambassador Luqman, 
today is also operating from his office at the embassy without 
any problems.

  [Excerpt] Cairo, 30 May (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak has 
announced that Egypt will respond appropriately to the Sudanese 
Government's provocations at the right time. There are limits 
to our patience, he said. 
  In his 11th annual meeting with the media, President Mubarak 
said Egyptians are good-natured people linked to the Sudanese 
people with bonds of brotherhood and cordiality. He added: The 
Sudanese Government will not provoke us into taking a position 
that harms the Sudanese people, whose well-being is a matter of 
concern to Egypt. 
  The president denied reports that 10,000 Egyptian soldiers 
have been sent to Hala'ib [on the Sudanese border]. There is no 
justification for such a step, he said. 
  He said the Sudanese Government's provocations against Egypt 
are meant to cover up Sudan's internal problems. Sudan's 
accusations against Egypt are shameful, he said. 
  The president added: I am seeking to establish peace 
throughout the world, so how can I seek a conflict with Sudan? 
They are trying to provoke us, but we will not be provoked 
unless our security is harmed. The acts they committed against 
Egypt are minor ones. 
  On Yemen's problem, President Mubarak said Egypt supports a 
Yemeni unity established on the right foundations, not one 
imposed by force. 
  What is happening in Yemen, he said, shows that the unity 
was 
not well-thought out. He said he had conveyed this view to 
Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. What is important now, 
the president said, is to stop the fighting, disengage the 
troops, and then begin a constructive dialogue. 
  Only arms dealers will benefit from a continuation of the 
war, and the Yemeni people will be the victims, he said. 
  In his statements, the president also discussed a number of 
domestic issues. He stressed that a housing law will not be 
issued until a thorough study has been completed by all sides 
and parties; it should be satisfactory to everybody, he said. 
  President Mubarak ruled out any dangers or contamination in 
the Nile's water as a result of the war in Rwanda. 
  He said terrorism is not a threat to Egypt, and efforts are 
under way to eliminate and uproot it. Everything is being done 
cautiously, he said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 27 May--A fugitive terrorist was killed in 
the al-Badari district in Asyut Governorate today while running

security directorate were setting up ambushes in the 'Arab 
Mutayr in the al-Badari district of the Asyut Governorate early 
this morning, fugitive terrorist 'Ali 'Abd-al-Rahman Salamah

  [Text] Cairo, 28 May (MENA)--A police conscript died and 
another was wounded by a spray of bullets fired accidentally 
from a submachine gun carried by a police noncommissioned 
officer [NCO] at Cairo International Airport. 
  NCO Muhammad Mamduh 'Abd-al-Wahhab, of Cairo Airport's 
General Police Directorate, who was on patrol duty on the 
tarmac, reported that police conscripts Mahmud Abu-Zayd Muhammad 
Khatib and Hamadah 'Ali 'Abdallah had suffered bullet injuries. 
  Upon examination it was found that Hamadah 'Ali 'Abdallah, 
the driver of the patrol vehicle, had died of a bullet fired 
from the firearm carried by the NCO. The bullet passed under his 
right arm and came out on the left side. Mahmud Abu-Zayd, who 
was standing next to the driver, suffered an injury to his left 
leg. 
  An official security source said that the empty magazine was 
found at the site of the incident and an examination of the 
other weapons showed that no other bullets had been fired. 
  The source added that an investigation revealed that there 
was no personal dispute between the NCO and the two policemen 
who were shot.

  [Text] Foreign Ministry Secretary General Zafir al-Hasan 
today summoned the ambassadors of the United States, Russia, 
France, Britain, and China for consultations on Lebanon's call 
for a UN Security Council [UNSC] meeting to discuss Israel's 
kidnapping of al-Hajj Mustafa al-Dirani. 
  Al-Hasan said Lebanon's decision to request a Security 
Council meeting will not await a response by the five big 
powers. He explained that Lebanon's Permanent Representative to 
the UN Khalil Makkawi has been instructed to call for a meeting 
without specifying a date for it. 
  After the meeting, Russian Ambassador Gennadiy Ilichev said 
he will convey Lebanon's request to his government for a 
decision. U.S. Ambassador Mark Hambley denied that he knows 
anything about U.S efforts to discourage Lebanon from calling 
for a UN Security Council meeting.

  [Excerpts] At 2000 today, Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz 
left Beirut for Amman to attend the conference of the Economic 
and Social Commission of West Asia, ESCWA, which will be held in 
the Jordanian capital between 29 and 31 May. 
  Speaking at the airport, Buwayz noted that before the 
events, 
Lebanon was the seat of ESCWA, which deals with economic 
development and construction. [passage omitted] 
  Asked about the latest developments in the contacts to call 
a 
UN Security Council [UNSC] session on Lebanon's complaint 
against Israeli acts of aggression and piracy, Buwayz replied: 
The Lebanese decision, of course, is geared toward convening a 
Security Council session to discuss the Lebanese complaint that 
was filed last week. We summoned the ambassadors of the 
permanent Security Council members yesterday to inform them of 
this decision and to find out their positions toward it. 
  He added: We know that the Security Council is facing some 
difficulties--let us call them difficulties. But in effect, we 
have to lay the responsibility on the shoulders of the Security 
Council, in any case. 
  Minister Buwayz was then asked: What are these difficulties? 
He replied: You know that heavy pressure may prevent the 
Security Council from holding a session immediately and 
automatically, as should have happened when we filed the 
complaint last week and asked for a session so that an 
appropriate resolution can be adopted.

  Al-Dirani's family yesterday appealed to the International

medical assistance to him. In a memorandum submitted to the 
ICRC, al-Dirani's family held Israel responsible for the 
deterioration of his health and for preventing the Red Cross

  [Excerpt] His highness the amir of Kuwait, God safeguard 
him, today received Mr. Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, the envoy of 
'Ali Salim al-Bid, the secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist 
Party. Al-'Attas briefed his highness about the fighting and the 
development of the conflict in Yemen, and the reactions to this 
crisis at the Arab and regional level. 
  His highness, God safeguard him, was keen to express 
Kuwait's 
firm and principled stance, which calls for tackling problems 
according to the logic of national interest and by brotherly 
dialogue without the use of violence. Resorting to violence and 
the use of arms increases disputes and complicates problems. It 
would also deepen wounds, waste energy and result in destruction. 
  In this context, His highness the amir, God safeguard him, 
expressed his concern that the Yemeni conflict could have a bad 
effect on the Arab situation. This is a matter that worries all 
leaders and officials, especially as the Arab nation needs to 
close ranks and reunite to regain its dignity and influence. 
  At the end of the meeting his highness the amir affirmed 
that 
Kuwait will support all honest and beneficial efforts to stop 
the bloodshed and restore understanding and reconciliation 
between the two parts of Yemen. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] His Highness Shaykh Jabir al-Ahmad al-Sabah, the 
amir of the fraternal state of Kuwait, this afternoon received 
brother Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, the prime minister, who 
briefed him on the developments of the dispute in our country, 
the progress of the battles there, and regional and Arab 
reactions. During the meeting, Shaykh Jabir al-Ahmad al-Sabah 
expressed fraternal Kuwait's firm and consistent stand which 
calls for the settling of disputes with the logic of national 
interest and fraternal dialogue in isolation of the use of 
force. His highness stressed during his meeting with brother 
Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas that the use of force and arms would 
only exacerbate the differences and problems. Wounds would be 
deepened and strength would be lost, while destruction would 
prevail. He said Kuwait would support any sincere and useful 
effort to stem the bloodshed and restore understanding and amity 
between the two parts of Yemen. The amir of Kuwait expressed 
fear that the Yemeni conflict would have adverse effects on the

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Before his departure from the 
fraternal state of Kuwait, Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr 
al-'Attas held a news conference in which he accused the Sanaa 
regime of aiming at controlling the oilfields in the Democratic 
Republic of Yemen. He pointed out that some Arab countries such 
as Iraq and Sudan are directly involved in the northern forces' 
war against our country. 
  The brother prime minister said that the northern forces' 
war 
against our country is exactly similar to Iraq's invasion of the 
fraternal state of Kuwait in 1990. In both cases there are 
misplaced ideas claiming the annexation of a part to the 
motherland. The brother prime minister confirmed that the 
objective behind the declaration of the Democratic Republic of 
Yemen was to prevent the breakup of Yemen into numerous smaller 
states.

Presidential Council chairman and supreme commander of the Armed 
Forces, today visited the Tariq Bin-Ziyad Camp. He was welcomed 
by the camp's commander, officers, NCO's, and soldiers. 
[passage omitted] 
  In an address, the brother chairman said that he was 
extremely happy to meet with the camp's officers, NCO's, and 
soldiers. He congratulated them and through them all valiant 
officers, NCO's, and soldiers of the Armed Forces on all combat 
axes as they wage the most honorable national battle to defend 
the homeland's unity and the unity's future. He said: I 
congratulate our people throughout the Yemeni homeland on the 
great and successive victories that have been scored and are 
being scored by our valiant troops, the soldiers of unity and 
constitutional legitimacy, against the gang of apostasy and 
secession which wanted to dismember the Yemeni homeland in 
return for a handful of dirty money. 
  Addressing the officers, NCO's, and soldiers, the brother 
chairman said: Your brothers on the combat axes are now waging 
the final and decisive battle against the gang of apostasy and 
secession and their supporters. He said this gang is an agent 
tool that takes delight in subservience and betraying the 
homeland. Backed by extensive popular support, our valiant 
Armed Forces continue to bring the dens of this gang under their 
iron grip to clear the homeland of their filth. 
  The brother chairman and supreme commander of the Armed 
Forces added: I am here today to bring you the glad tidings of 
the victory and to express appreciation for you and for every 
soldier, officer, and NCO. Thanks to your faith, unwavering 
resolve, and firm positions, you are recording epics of glory 
and victory for the Yemeni people's will to maintain unity and 
democracy. It is the will of the faithful, sincere men who 
never yield in the face of ordeals and disasters and who are 
defending the most precious gains of the Yemeni revolution and 
the Yemeni people, namely, unity and democracy. You are 
defending constitutional legitimacy and all the sublime 
principles and values of our one Yemeni people and their eternal 
unity. 
  The brother chairman and supreme commander of the Armed 
Forces said: I convey to you and to the masses of our Yemeni 
people the congratulations of the fighters who are firmly 
advancing toward the last strongholds and dens of the 
secessionist gang in valiant Aden to purge it of their filth. 
Your valiant troops are also marching toward Hadhramaut to 
liquidate the remainder of the gang, led by agent, treasonous 
criminal 'Ali Salim al-Bid. 
  The brother chairman said: Congratulations to you in the 
Armed Forces, the forces of unity and legitimacy, as you wage or 
contribute to this national battle, the battle of unity, 
democracy, and defending the homeland; the battle of honor, 
heroism, self- denial, and dignity. Glory to all the righteous 
martyrs. May they have God's mercy and forgiveness in the 
Garden of Eden. Be sure that God is on your side and that our 
people back you. March from one victory to another. May God 
support you. Peace be upon you. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] The House of Representatives this morning 
started the sessions of the first period of the first round of 
its second annual term under brother Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn 
al-Ahmar, the House speaker. 
  On the occasion of the House starting its second annual 
term, 
the brother House of Representatives speaker delivered a speech 
in which he congratulated the House of Representatives members 
and the Yemeni people on the blessed 'Id al-Adha and the fourth 
unity anniversary, which will remain a shining point in the 
history of our people and a major turning point in their blessed 
march. 
  The House of Representatives speaker noted that the 
parliamentary elections of 27 April [1993] provided clear 
evidence of our people's awareness and sound instincts. These 
elections, he said, produced a new political reality in the 
Yemeni arena. 
  The House of Representatives speaker noted that the 
secessionist group in the Socialist Party leadership, which led 
the country to war and infighting, had also directed its 
poisonous arrows against the House of Representatives by taking 
advantage of its positions in the state's executive agencies, 
despite the fact that the House had to put up with a great deal 
of arrogance from some of these leaders out of concern for the 
march of goodness and prosperity, and out of concern for 
national unity. 
  After that, the House reviewed and approved the agenda of 
the 
current parliamentary term. The House also listened to and 
approved the minutes of the last session of the previous 
parliamentary term. 
  The House then listened to a letter addressed to it by 
Justice Minister 'Abdallah Ahmad Ghanim on the public actions 
committed by Ahmad 'Ubayd Bin-Daghr, Anis Hasan Yahya, Haydar 
Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, Salim Muhammad Jubran, Qasim 'Abd-al-Rabb, 
and Muhammad 'Ali al- Qayrahi, including the crimes of violating 
the Constitution, attacking citizens and private and public 
property, issuing orders in contravention of the law, and 
organizing rebellion against the public order despite being 
members of the House. He said confirmed information on these 
acts were received from the Defense Ministry, the Interior 
Ministry, and other parties. 
  The justice minister's letter to the House states: 
  We appreciate your positive response to allow us to take the 
legal measures against them in accordance with your 
prerogatives, as stipulated in the Constitution, and in 
accordance with Article 64-F. [passage omitted] In accordance 
with the aforementioned articles and following your permission, 
the Public Prosecutor issued an arrest warrant against these 
persons, as well as others. We hope you will take measures to 
inform the House of these details in accordance with the 
aforesaid articles. We will keep your esteemed House informed 
of all developments. 
  The House then discussed the Public Prosecutor's report 
which 
was referred to it by the justice minister. Following a lengthy 
discussion of this subject, the matter was referred to the 
Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee to study it in an 
urgent manner and to present a ruling to the House on the 
request to deprive the members mentioned in the justice 
minister's memorandum on their immunity, in accordance with the 
Constitutional texts and the House of Representatives bylaws 
issued by Law No. 5 of 1990. 
  The people's deputies then discussed al-Bid's declaration 
of secession. The House members, including members of the 
Yemeni Socialist Party bloc, stressed that the declaration of 
secession by al-Bid and his gang is a stab in the heart of every 
Yemeni. Members stressed that the war is between unity and the 
enemies of unity and that everyone supports unity, and that the 
people will sacrifice everything dear to protect it. 
  The House also stressed the need to preserve democracy and 
Constitutional legitimacy and its absolute rejection of any 
foreign intervention in the Republic of Yemen's internal 
affairs, because any intervention or recognition of the 
secessionist gang only expresses a flagrant animosity against 
the entire Yemeni people and a hostility against their 
Constitutional and democratic institutions. 
  The House set up a committee comprising House Members Yahya 
'Ali (al-Ra'i), 'Abdallah Sharaf (al-Humaydi), Yahya Mansur 
Abu-Usba', Muhammad 'Abdallah (al-Kifli), Mansur Ahmad Sayf, 
Muhammad Naji ('Allaw), 'Abdu Muhammad al-Zanadi, Muhammad Yahya 
Hammud (al- Sharafi) to draft a statement refuting the 
declaration of secession, stressing the need to protect unity 
through all means, and urging all states, particularly Arab 
states, to support unity and [words indistinct] overcome the 
sedition that was fabricated by some elements that have turned 
against the Constitution and legitimacy and against the will of 
the people as expressed by the elections of 27 April 1993. 
  The House also set up a committee including members 
'Abdallah 
'Ali (Sa'tar), Muhammad 'Ali Ba Musallam, Sultan Sa'id (al- 
Barakani), 'Abdallah Mahdi 'Abdu, 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Rawhani, and 
Sultan (Sayyan al-'Adwani) to draft letters to the Arab League, 
the UN secretary general, and to the parliaments of the 
fraternal and friendly states. 
  The House also asked the government to send the brother 
foreign minister to attend the House's session tomorrow, Sunday 
[29 May], to explain the political situation concerning the 
developments in our country so that the parliament can take the 
necessary steps. 
  Today's session was attended by brother Dr. 'Abd-Salam 
Khalid 
Salman, minister of legal affairs and minister of the House of 
Representatives affairs. The House will resume its sessions 
tomorrow, God willing.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Yemeni House of Representatives on </F>
29 May] 
  [Text] Statement by the House of Representatives 
concerning the declaration of secession. 
  Praise be to God, who said in the Holy Koran: And hold fast, 
all together, by the rope which God stretches out for you, and 
be not divided among yourselves. Blessings and prayers of God 
on His Prophet Muhammad, his household, and companions. 
  The House of Representatives, the legitimate representative 
of all people of the united Yemen and the voice of their will, 
[words indistinct] the national responsibility it shoulders, and 
out of its understanding of the threats (?facing the country) 
these days has broken off its holiday [words indistinct] on 17 
Dhi al-Hijjah 1414 hegira, corresponding to 28 May 1994 to 
discuss the (?criminal) act committed by 'Ali Salim al-Bid and 
his secessionist gang against the country's unity, sovereignty, 
and stability by declaring secession on 21 May 1994. 
  In view of the seriousness of this act, which is considered 
high treason and a violation of the Constitution and an 
infringement on the Republic of Yemen's sovereignty, 
independence, and territorial integrity, the people's deputies 
discussed this treacherous act from all Constitutional, legal, 
and political aspects in the light of the Constitution and the 
valid laws and the country's higher national interests. 
  Based on these discussions and the constitutional and legal 
texts, the House of Representatives decides the following: 
  1. (?To condemn) al-Bid's declaration of secession as a 
violation of the Constitution and all valid laws in the Republic 
of Yemen. 
  2. The House considers this declaration not only a rebellion 
against legitimacy, but also a flagrant encroachment against the 
will of the Yemeni people and their unity, independence, 
sovereignty, security and stability. All unionist and 
democratic forces, as well as all citizens, must stand against 
this act and confront it through all means since it is a 
criminal act, which calls for bringing al-Bid and those who 
supported him to trial on charges of high treason on the basis 
of the Constitution and the valid laws. 
  3. The House of Representatives, as a legislative body, 
represents all the people and adopts its decisions by majority 
at official meetings and in accordance with the Constitution and 
its bylaws. No deputy or group of deputies has the right to 
hold a meeting or adopt a decision outside its headquarters and 
away from its speakership. This indicates that what these 
elements had done is null and void. These elements alleged that 
they represent the Yemeni Socialist Party bloc, and they 
approved al-Bid's secessionist declaration. Their action 
represented an aggression against the unity, independence, and 
territorial integrity of Yemen. 
  4. The House of Representatives urges all sisterly and 
friendly countries to respect their positions and commitments 
toward the Republic of Yemen as an independent sovereign state 
that is an Arab League and UN member, and not to interfere in 
its affairs, because what is going on is an internal affair in 
which no country has the right to interfere, in accordance with 
the Constitution of the Republic of Yemen, the Arab League 
Charter, and international charters. 
  The House emphasizes that any interference by any country or 
any regional or international organization represents a 
dangerous sign that will prolong strife and shift it from the 
Yemeni horizon to the Arab and international horizons. This 
will also open the way for renegade movements in a number of 
countries, and will widen differences among the countries 
involved in this interference. 
  The House of Representatives appreciates the heroic 
positions 
of the Armed Forces which protect unity and legitimacy. We pray 
Almighty God to grant these forces success, and we urge all sons 
of the Yemeni people to support the Armed Forces in order to 
protect unity and legitimacy by all material and moral means. 
  The House urges the soldiers, noncommissioned officers, and 
officers who are subjected to the orders of the secessionist 
clique to join the army of unity and legitimacy in order to 
preserve the peoples' respect for them, and to protect their 
militant assets. 
  We seek God's support, and peace be upon you. 
  [Signed] The House of Representatives on 18 Dhu al-Hijjah, 
1414 Hegira, corresponding to 29 May 1994

  [Text] On behalf of the government, Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim 
al-Iryani, minister of planning and development, today submitted 
a verbal report to the House of Representatives on Yemeni 
developments from the political perspective. The brother 
minister dismissed any possibility of a definitive end to the 
fighting short of recognizing constitutional legality and 
placing those who are still misguided in the Armed Forces under 
the command of constitutional legality. It is not surprising 
that a number of brother and friendly countries have called for 
a cease-fire -- some of them in good faith -- due to their (?not 
knowing what will happen) after the cease-fire. He emphasized 
that a cease-fire will not be possible before constitutional 
legality is recognized and the Armed Forces are placed under a 
single command. It is possible to engage unionists in the 
Socialist Party in dialogue after the voiding of the secession 
declared by the traitor 'Ali Salim al-Bid and [word indistinct] 
to the Constitution and [word indistinct] and the results of the 
elections of 27 April, 1993. 
  Later, the House Constitutional Committee read out a report 
to the people's deputies concerning a request to lift 
parliamentary immunity from a number of deputies. 
  The committee's report, which led with the constitutional 
and 
legal standpoints, also stated the following: 
  Given that the crimes committed [words indistinct] as stated 
by the memorandum of the brother minister of justice, which 
proves that the legal action has not been not brought out of 
spite, and in view of compliance with the legal and 
(?procedural) aspects in this regard, and accordingly, the House 
(words indistinct) the following: 
  The parliamentary immunity shall be lifted from the house 
members listed below: 
  [Name indistinct], number of the constituency: Ahmad 'Ubayd 
[word indistinct], 154; Anis Hasan ('Atwah), 25; Haydar Abu-Bakr 
al-'Attas, (?161); (Salim) Muhammad Jubran, 152; Qasim 
'Abd-al-Rabb Salih, 21; Muhammad 'Ali (al-Qayrahi), 126. 
  [Words indistinct] the judicial authorities to take measures 
toward the arrest, search, and investigation, or imprisonment, 
or any other penal measures that justice authorities deem fit to 
take against them as per Article (?64) of the Republic of 
Yemen's Constitution. 
  Second [as heard], the committee recommends that the House 
Speakership Council pursue investigation and prosecution, and 
brief the House on evolving developments. The House has 
approved the recommendations of the Constitutional and Legal 
Committee in this regard. [Words indistinct] messages [words 
indistinct] to the Arab League secretary general, the UN 
secretary general, and Arab and international [word indistinct] 
about the developments in the Yemeni arena. 
  The House is to resume tomorrow morning, Monday [words 
indistinct]

  [Text] The Yemeni authorities say they expect a political 
message from the south to arrive this evening. 
  Planning Minister 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani said the Yemeni 
Government had issued no military communiques since Tuesday [24 
May] evening because it is all quiet on the front. He declined 
to say who the message will be from or what it would be about. 
  In Sanaa, Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has called 
in 
the ambassadors of the permanent member states of the United 
Nations Security Council. Diplomatic sources said Mr. Salih 
told the ambassadors that if the council were to say anything, 
Sanaa would prefer that it be a council president's statement 
rather than a resolution.

  He said Sanaa is awaiting a political message from Aden but 
did not disclose its contents. 
  Al-Iryani said one the reasons that military communiques 
have 
not been released since Tuesday is because the situation on the

  [Text] Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, minister of planning 
and development, has rejected any UN Security Council 
intervention in the Yemeni crisis as an intrusion upon a 
domestic Yemeni affair. Yemen's position on any resolution that 
the council may pass will be influenced by its wording, the 
minister told Radio Qatar during an interview it carried today. 
Asked to comment on a political initiative by the [Yemeni] 
Socialist Party [YSP], the minister said he thought Sanaa and 
unionists within the YSP in Aden were in touch in an attempt to 
fashion a mutually agreeable formula. If such a formula is 
worked out, he added, it will mark a point of departure. The 
minister stressed that any such arrangement should provide for 
Yemen's unity, preserve legitimacy, produce a cease-fire, and 
ensure the unity of the military. These are key elements of the 
consultations, he pointed out. 
  A decision about whether the forces of legitimacy would 
enter 
Aden, al-Iryani said, would be made with reference to political 
considerations and a concern to spare civilians the horrors of 
war. 
  The Arab League's approach to the developments in Yemen must 
respect the country's national unity, Constitutional legitimacy, 
and the unity of the Armed Forces. Any Arab mediation effort 
not grounded in these principles will be non-productive, the 
foreign minister stressed. Arab mediation efforts have yet to 
go beyond exhortations to stop fighting to a well-defined plan 
for a practical solution. This kind of approach was plausible 
before the war broke out. However, with a war now raging, there 
is a need for a political agreement that will rule out a future 
recourse to force of arms. 
  Dr. al-Iryani praised Qatar's position underscoring Yemen's 
unity and Constitutional legitimacy.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive report" by Fathi al-Qatta'] </F>
  [Text] AL-DUSTUR has contacted Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani 
in Sanaa. Al-Iryani is the minister of development and planning 
and a former foreign minister. He is also close to Yemeni 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and is sometimes called the 
engineer of Yemeni policy. 
  During our telephone conversation, al-Iryani said that a 
decision to enter the city of Aden by force, following the 
two-week siege, would be a political and not a military 
question. There are 400,000 citizens in Aden and the leadership 
does not want to risk their lives. 
  Asked about the failure of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, 
proclaimed on 21 May, to secure recognition, even from countries 
that do not have any political weight -- which could have been a 
victory for it that would open the door to further recognition 
-- al-Iryani said there is no alternative to reversing the 
secession. He said he expects the secessionists to go. 
  On the current moves, namely, the request made by Egypt, the 
United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuwait, and Bahrain, 
to hold an urgent session of the Security Council to discuss the 
situation in Yemen, al-Iryani said: The Security Council member 
states have asserted to our mission in New York that they adhere 
to Yemen's unity and democracy and respect its sovereignty and 
independence. Any resolution adopted by the Council that 
contradicts this reality will be rejected. 
  On the meeting scheduled to be held by the foreign ministers 
of the Gulf Cooperation Council in Saudi Arabia during the 
coming hours, al-Iryani said he had no comment, however, if this 
meeting aims at interfering in Yemen's domestic affairs, then it 
will be a serious precedent. 
  Regarding a statement issued by the Political Bureau of the 
Socialist Party, carried by Aden radio yesterday, denying 
al-Iryani's statements to the media about a secret dialogue 
going on between those al-Iryani described as the unionists 
within the Socialist Party and the leadership in Sanaa, 
al-Iryani said: They are free to deny or confirm whatever they 
want. The important thing is that we have received a signal 
from a third party -- a senior Yemeni figure whom he declined to 
name -- according to which the brothers in Aden say verbatim: 
Let us first agree to a cease-fire and then everything is 
negotiable. This came in reply to previous messages. 
  Regarding accusations propagated by some Arab media in their 
comments on Yemen that the General People's Congress [GPC] and 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih himself, who is the GPC's 
secretary general, have sought to divide the ranks of the 
Socialist Party -- by trying to win over some of its influential 
leaders, such as Salim Salih Muhammad, the assistant secretary 
general of the Socialist Party and dismissed Presidential 
Council member who was appointed with the separatist state; and 
Haytham Qasim Tahir, member of the Political Bureau and the 
dismissed defense minister -- Dr. al-Iryani said he can prove 
that 'Ali Salim al-Bid is the one who proposed the question of 
merger. Al-Bid cannot deny this. 
  Al-Iryani added that the separatists cannot talk about the 
accord document when they talk about secession. Had the 
document been implemented, it would have enhanced unity because 
it was signed by all the political forces in Yemen. The first to 
spurn this document was the Socialist Party. Al-Iryani denied 
that Haytham Qasim Tahir, the former defense minister, was 
killed recently. 
  Dr. al-Iryani said all Yemenis, young and old, value 
Jordan's 
true fraternal position in support of the Yemeni people.

  [Text] Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, the House of 
Representatives speaker, has stressed that what is happening in 
Yemen is an internal affair that is of no concern to the UN 
Security Council. He noted that if the UN Security Council is 
concerned about human rights, then it should rescue the people 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  These statements emerged in a news conference held by the 
brother House of Representatives speaker in Abu Dhabi yesterday. 
He explained that the Yemeni people are offering everything for 
the sake of unity because it is dear and is worthy of 
sacrificing lives. 
  Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar said Yemeni unity is 
considered a foundation stone on the path of Arab unity. 
Therefore, he said, any recognition of the separatists is 
tantamount to hostility against the Yemeni people. 
  He added: Doors are open and bridges are built with all 
fraternal Arab and friendly states. The door to dialogue has 
not been closed with the unionists in the Socialist Party.

<F P=106> [Reports by 'Abdallah Hammudah and Amir Taheri in London, </F>
Naji al-Harazi in Sanaa, Nura Fakhuri and Taj-al-Din 
'Abd-al-Haqq in Abu-Dhabi, and AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT bureaus in Aden 
and Cairo: "Failure of the Meeting between Zayid and al-Ahmar 
Speeds Up United Arab Emirates' Official Recognition of 
Democratic Yemen; Salih Tries to Impose `Legitimacy' by 
Penetrating Hadramaut and Splitting the Socialist Party] 
  [Excerpts] The Yemeni war raged on yesterday while the 
search continued for a diplomatic solution that would determine 
the fate and future of the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY]. 
Indications at both levels are that the Sanaa leadership is 
determined to impose what it sees as "legitimate and 
constitutional" by all means including opening a front in 
Hadramaut and trying to split the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] 
despite rejection by the southerners and the YSP leadership. 
[passage omitted] 
  Diplomatic sources in Abu-Dhabi have stated that the failure 
of the meeting held between Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar 
[Yemeni House of Representatives speaker, Yemeni Reform Grouping 
leader, and Hashid tribes chieftain], and [United Arab Emirates 
President] Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan might speed up 
the official recognition of the new southern state in Yemen 
because al-Ahmar's visit was "Sanaa's last card to clear the air 
with Abu-Dhabi, which has frankly held 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
responsible for the continuation of the fighting." 
  Diplomatic observers say that "nobody can succeed where 
al-Ahmar failed because of al-Ahmar's close personal 
relationship with Shaykh Zayid and his tribal weight in the 
region." Al-Ahmar's statement after the meeting reflected his 
extreme annoyance because 'Ali Salim al-Bid had been described 
as president. He said "that is a very big word, and it is an 
insult to Yemen." Despite his implicit criticism of the United 
Arab Emirates, Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar said at his press 
conference: "I do not believe that any Arab or friendly state 
would recognize the secession." 
  Al-Ahmar emphasized that resorting to military means to 
settle the issue "was the last choice in the interest of 
safeguarding Yemen's unity." He added that "Yemen does not 
reject mediation to stop the war provided it is in the context 
of legitimacy." He denied the rumors about the possibility of a 
meeting between President Salih and the southern leader 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid. He said that "it would be improper to hold a 
meeting between the president and a mutineer." 
  Al-Ahmar rejected intervention by the Security Council in 
the 
Yemeni conflict. He said: "What has the Security Council to do 
with an internal issue?" But he avoided the pitfall in which 
Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, planning and development minister 
and member of the General Committee (Political Bureau) of the 
General People's Congress [GPC] -- President Salih's party -- 
slipped when he accused foreign powers of aiding the mutineering 
secessionists. Shaykh 'Abdallah did not apportion any blame in 
that respect. 
  The Yemeni House of Representatives speaker denied the 
presence of any extremist forces in Yemen. He said that Sanaa 
has given the United States assurances on that and got from it 
an assurance of support for Yemeni unity. He also denied that 
former south Yemeni President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad was offered 
the post of president. He said: "'Ali Nasir Muhammad is a 
patriotic leader but we do not offer posts to anyone. The way 
is open for everyone to serve the homeland." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Letter from "political parties and organizations, and mass, </F>
creative, and popular organizations in the Republic of Yemen" to 
UN Security Council president; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Brother UN Security Council president: 
  Greetings, 
  We would like to inform your excellency, as well as the UN 
Security Council member states, of our absolute rejection of any 
intervention by your esteemed council in what is happening 
inside our country, since it is an internal affair. What is 
happening is that the entire people are seeking to preserve 
their unity, which will guarantee their stability and the 
stability of the region, against a attempted secession and a 
rebellion that aims at striking at their unity, Constitutional 
legitimacy, and stability. This attempt represents only those 
who are behind it, and not the Yemeni people, who agree on unity. 
  You must understand that involving the Security Council in 
such an internal affair will only help complicate the problem 
and damage the sincere Yemeni efforts that are being exerted to 
end and contain the rebellion, on the basis of preserving the 
unity of our country and abidance by the Constitution and 
Constitutional legitimacy, which were strengthened by the first 
free, democratic elections on 27 April 1993, as testified by the 
entire world, foremost of which are the five permanent members 
of your esteemed council. 
  Any intervention constitutes an aggression against the 
Republic of Yemen's unity and regional sovereignty and is 
unacceptable to our people or the norms of international law, 
which underline the sovereignty of UN member states. 
  We urge your esteemed council to advise all states in the 
region to respect the Republic of Yemen's sovereignty, to 
strictly abide by international law and the UN Charter, and not 
to intervene in Yemeni internal affairs, out of concern for 
world peace and security. 
  Please distribute this cable to all member states as a UN 
document. Please accept our best regards.

  [Text] 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, Presidential Council 
member, has left Sanaa for Amman en route to New York. Before 
leaving Sanaa International Airport, he made the following 
statement to the Yemeni News Agency, SABA': 
  Entrusted by the Presidential Council and the Council of 
Ministers, I will represent the Republic of Yemen in the UN 
Security Council [UNSC] deliberations, which were requested by 
certain states. In this regard, we are interested in explaining 
the facts as they are to the UN Security Council to ensure that 
the results of these deliberations will be in harmony with the 
hopes of our people to preserve the country's unity and 
democratic march in the face of the conspiracy and malicious 
attack against unity and democracy by the secessionist elements 
in the Socialist Party leadership. These elements are trying to 
reverse history by insisting on returning to the pre-22 May 1990 
situation. 
  We will also brief the UN Security Council on the truth 
about 
what is happening in our country. It is an armed rebellion 
against constitutional legitimacy and a violation of the 
Constitution and a flagrant attack against citizens and their 
security and stability. The legitimate agencies' fulfillment of 
their tasks in the face of the armed rebellion reflect their 
national and constitutional responsibility to protect the 
sovereignty and stability of the homeland; it is also an 
internal affair and no one should interfere in it.

<F P=106> ["Text" of a letter from the Yemeni House of Representatives </F>
to Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid and 
the Arab League's permanent representatives on 30 May; place not 
given -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. For the scum disappears like froth cast out; 
while that which is for the good of mankind remains on the 
earth. [Koranic verse] 
  Esteemed Brother Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, Arab League 
secretary general; Esteemed Brother Permanent Delegates: A 
message of respect and appreciation. Your Yemeni homeland is 
experiencing critical circumstances as a result of the ordeal 
imposed by a group of rebels who violated the constitutional 
legitimacy, represented by 'Ali Salim al-Bid and those with him. 
The sedition Yemen is experiencing poses grave dangers to 
Yemen's present, future, unity, democracy, political system, 
sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, and cohesion 
of its sons. At the same time, it is a serious sign not only on 
the level of the Yemeni homeland but also on the level of the 
entire Arab homeland's peoples and governments. It also 
represents a challenge to our Arab League's charter, the 
international organizations, and the bases on which states were 
established. However, what calls for happiness and pleasure is 
that our esteemed House and its members, who represent the 
Yemeni people, see in our Arab League and in the peoples and 
governments of its Arab nation both support and assistance 
designed to champion it and understand its causes as well as a 
helper and supporter designed to curb the insane adventures of 
the rebellious secessionists and circumvent both dangers and 
suffering, exactly as you have always done for this House. 
  Brother Arab League Secretary General, Brother Permanent 
Delegates: For our people, the reestablishment of Yemeni unity 
by setting up the Republic of Yemen on 22 May 1990--unity which 
all Arabs had the honor of backing and supporting as an Arab 
experience and a step on the path of fulfilling our Arab 
nation's great dream of unity--was a pioneering civilized 
achievement, a normal event, and a simple way to realize both 
the cohesion of resources and the unification of efforts for 
development and progress. It was also a reunification of 
families which were separated by artificial borders during the 
eras of colonialism and the hateful imamate rule, and which were 
also scattered by the policy of confrontation during the eras of 
the resented partition that was due to known reasons by which 
all capabilities and resources were used in a lengthy conflict. 
During this conflict, the differences were deepened and the 
mutual trust was so weakened that its repercussions cannot be 
measured by time standards. As a result of this conflict, all 
the Yemeni people paid a dear and doubled price during all the 
phases of the partition until, after much endurance, the people 
achieved their objective of unity. For this people, unity was a 
humanitarian salvation by all standards since there was a 
project to restore the values of amity, good relations among 
relatives, and tolerance among brothers and fathers, and also a 
return to safety and reassurance for the people. 
  Yemeni unity also represented a civilized project to build a 
modern Yemeni state based on democracy, political and party 
pluralism, peaceful sharing of power, justice, equality, respect 
for rights and freedoms, and supremacy of law. Through this 
project, the Yemeni people irreversibly disposed of oppression, 
tyranny, injustice, and persecution. Through this project, the 
Yemeni people circumvented all the suffering, pains, the 
catastrophes of time, the bereavement of wives, the wailing of 
victims, and the destruction of families, which they long 
suffered in the past as a result of the bloody conflicts and 
painful armed confrontations throughout more than two decades. 
  Our esteemed Arab League, along with all Arab brethren, were 
not far or absent from all this. As the highest body and most 
important institution, the Arab League worked along with the 
Arab brethren on the level of states and governments 
collectively and individually. The Arabs sensed both the ordeal 
and concerns of their Yemeni brethren, and made efforts to 
contain the crises, and end and save the people from their 
ordeal. The Arabs also worked by all means to help the Yemenis 
achieve their sought objective and safe haven; namely, Yemeni 
unity. 
  They also played a great role in extinguishing the fire of 
war, which broke out from time to time in the country or in each 
of the two parts of the country. They also worked very eagerly 
to restore its cohesion by achieving unity. These positions, 
which the Yemeni people have never forgotten and which will 
remain as immortal as history in their memory, were adopted by 
the brothers out of their pan-Arab responsibility, their 
religious duty, and their true brotherly and human concern and 
in accordance with the Arab League member states' agreement that 
led to its establishment and that was included in its charter. 
This is because they believed that the primary objective of 
unity of the Arab nation, for which the Arab League was 
established, should begin in full swing with Yemen, which 
contains the real seeds of Arab unity and whose land and people 
have enjoyed unity of doctrine, language, race, and fate since 
time immemorial and since the creation of the world. 
  This is what our Arab governments believe within their 
pan-Arab framework, the Arab League, in line with the Yemeni 
people's belief, unanimity, and yearning for unity and in 
harmony with the commitments of all their leaders that assumed 
power in the so-called two parts of Yemen. In light of this, 
the Arab League sponsored the first Yemeni unity agreement in 
1972, which was worked out under the Arab League's canopy and at 
its headquarters in Cairo, as well as the ensuing agreements in 
Tripoli, Algiers, and Kuwait. The committees, which were formed 
by the leaderships of the two parts at that time, worked for 
that end. The Constitution of the Republic of Yemen was 
accomplished in 1981, a Constitution under which Yemen was 
unified in 1990 and which united the parts of Yemen into one 
unified Yemeni entity, ending the eras of partition, division, 
wars, and destruction for good. A referendum was held for the 
entire people in May 1991, and the first elections were held on 
the level of the entire homeland in April 1993 based on 
democracy, political pluralism, and multiparty system, and 
peaceful rotation of power. The whole world acknowledged these 
elections' success and fairness and all the forces blessed it. 
  All the legislations and unionist laws of the one Yemen were 
issued in accordance with the Constitution, and the government 
coalition, made up of the General People's Congress, the Yemeni 
Socialist Party, and the Yemeni Reform Grouping, was formed as a 
natural result of the elections. The coalition document signed 
by the three parties contained the basic pillars of the 
government's program, chief of which was preserving Yemeni unity 
and democracy. Article 1 of the Constitution stipulates that the 
Republic of Yemen is an independent and sovereign state, that it 
is a unity that cannot be divided, that no part can be 
relinquished, and that the Yemeni people are part of the Arab 
nation and the Islamic world. In light of this, new interests 
and relations were reinforced among the sons of the one homeland 
and on the level of the regions and the governorates. 
  Arab League Secretary General, Permanent Delegates: You know 
well that the Yemeni unity did not take place between two 
peoples, who are prevented by geographic, language, national, 
cultural, and ideological obstacles from going ahead with their 
unionist dreams. Neither was it an emotional unity and a mere 
unification of interests. Rather, it was a unity of a nation 
that will remain unified in terms of land and people. The 
partitioning that occurred from time to time as result of 
colonialism or power struggle was an exception. Those who 
follow Yemen's old and modern history will discover an eternal 
unity among the sons of the one Yemeni people, even during the 
ugly eras. The sons of the Yemeni people were not treated 
within the framework of the big Yemeni homeland as foreign 
nationals. On the contrary, the people, the authority, and the 
successive systems and rulers rejected division and its 
imposition on the Yemeni people. 
  Brother Secretary General, Brother Permanent Delegates: Our 
Yemeni people view Yemeni unity not as just a national and 
pan-Arab gain but also as their salvation, their life, future, 
dreams, and hopes. The proof that they deeply cherish unity is 
by sincerely emphasizing that for them unity is life and that 
any retraction from it or any harm to it is tantamount to a 
death sentence and a crime against innocent people who have been 
aspiring for a united homeland without barriers in which the 
minds, spirits, and funds will be secure. Our people reject in 
advance any step that partitions the homeland into entities that 
have the rank of states, that slices any part of the Republic of 
Yemen, or that constitutes a deviation from its legal status 
that was proclaimed on 22 May 1992 and which was recognized 
worldwide. From this premise, our people refuse any attempt to 
take the Yemeni issue out of its sound and objective context as 
a domestic issue, or that will lead them to catastrophes that 
imperil the one homeland such as the step that was made by those 
who have rebelled against constitutional legitimacy, those who 
have deviated from national consensus, those who have disavowed 
the homeland and nationalism, the advocates of secession, 'Ali 
Salim al- Bid and those with him. 
  Brothers, we do not doubt that our fraternal Arab people, 
their governments, and their leaders, and our Arab League which 
has nurtured and blessed Yemeni unity will accept nothing less 
than the perpetuation of this unity. We also do not believe the 
Arab League will stifle this unity's objective and dream, will 
deal it a lethal blow, or pass a death sentence on an entire 
people, thus definitively ending the Arab League's pan-Arab 
project, the source of its pride and dignity and the safety 
valve for its present and future. 
  We also do not believe that our Arab League and the leaders 
of fraternal states who enjoy farsightedness will accept 
al-Bid's treasonous step, or encourage any dangerous and strange 
act by any adventurer who tries to partition homelands, or 
permit that a rebel, adventurer, or whimsical person be given 
the chance to establish a state to satisfy his ego and 
intransigence, just because he has some military power and 
harbors evil ambitions to assume power at the expense of 
homelands and people and in defiance of their options and will. 
It is really a very grave step that will transform homelands 
into waste. 
  As for us, we find no words that are more eloquent than to 
say that Yemeni unity is our destiny and our fate and that our 
Yemeni people wherever they are will only agree to unity and 
will not relinquish it, no matter what this will cost them. Our 
people view any condoning of the crime by traitor al-Bid and the 
secessionists who support him in the YSP command and his 
proclamation as a disavowal of the bonds of amity and the blood 
relationship, and a violation of conventions such as the Arab 
League Charter, not to mention that this will be an unjustified 
interfererence in their domestic affairs, a prolongation of the 
rebellion and the war whose scope could expand, and a sedition 
which has no limits. 
  Our people also view any stand by their brothers that 
sympathizes with the rebellion as an illogical support for those 
who have no status or legitimacy and an attempt to impose 
tutelage on the Yemeni people. 
  We regret, and you are in a position to know better, that 
what is taking place in our country is portrayed in a manner 
that is different from what it really is, or in a way that makes 
people call it something else. This is because the Yemeni 
people are one people and there is no place for the word south 
and north. 
  As representatives of the Yemeni people, we ask you to act 
with responsibility, and support legitimacy and unity and not 
the opposite. We greatly appreciate the support and assistance 
you have offered in the past for the Yemeni revolution and unity 
and we thank you for these noble stands. How can we not say 
this when our Egyptian brothers had sacrificed their lives in 
support for Yemeni revolution and in trying to unite our people 
following the liberation of that part of Yemen that was occupied 
at the time? 
  In conclusion, you are called upon to place right within its 
proper place, and to safeguard Yemen. Safeguarding Yemen cannot 
but be achieved through the preservation of its unity. As for 
partitioning, it means destruction and continuous wars. We do 
not believe you will accept this for a Muslim Arab people. 
  We wish that this letter be considered as an Arab League 
document and that it will be distributed to the members. We 
thank you for your understanding of our just cause. Please 
accept our best regards.

  [Excerpts] Sanaa -- Yemeni Information Minister Hasan 
al-Lawzi has praised Jordan's role in the Yemeni crisis. He 
said that the stand adopted by Jordan --king, government and 
people -- is a principled stand based on the nation's interest 
in unity. [passage omitted] 
  On future prospects, the possibility of internationalizing 
the crisis, and on Arab countries' recognition of the secession, 
Dr. al-Lawzi said: I do not believe any Arab country will dare 
to publicly recognize the secession. [passage omitted] 
  Al-Lawzi said: If some try to create problems abroad for 
Yemeni unity and legitimacy then the situation will have to be 
expeditiously settled in a military manner no matter the cost. 
However, I have to say that there are signs of a political 
solution through reaching an understanding with the unionist 
elements within the Yemeni Socialist Party. This factor, in 
addition to the Yemeni command's desire to avoid large numbers 
of civilian casualties, postpones the military option. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Foreign Minister brother Muhammad Salim Basindwah 
today left for Cairo on a visit to Egypt. He will convey a 
message from Lieutenant General brother 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
Presidential Council chairman, to his brother President Husni 
Mubarak about relations between the two brotherly countries and 
Yemeni developments. Basindwah will also lead our country's 
delegation to meetings of foreign ministers of the Nonaligned 
Movement, set to convene in Cairo from 30 May to 4 June. 
  Before leaving Sanaa, the foreign minister told SABA' he 
will 
take the opportunity of his presence in the Egyptian capital and 
his attendance at the nonaligned conference to convey a true 
picture of what is going on in Yemen to as many ministers as 
possible. He will make the point that no one is out to force 
unity on others, because unity has been in place for four years. 
It must be made clear to the world that there is an attempt to 
force secession on the country and that some quarters try to 
misrepresent the situation. 
  The foreign minister hoped the nonaligned conference will 
produce beneficial decisions for the peoples of the movement. 
  The Yemeni delegation to the conference includes the under 
secretary for political affairs at the Foreign Ministry, and 
other ministry officials.

<F P=106> [Report by Nasir 'Arif in Sanaa] </F>
  [Text] Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Basindwah has 
asserted that the criticism by some people of the legitimate 
Yemeni Government and their accusations that it is trying, 
through war, to impose Yemeni unity by force are null and void 
and lack objectivity because unity has been maintained since 22 
May 1990, when a document on merging the Yemeni people was 
signed. 
  In an exclusive statement to AL-ASWAQ, the Yemeni foreign 
minister added that everyone should realize that the [Yemeni] 
Socialist Party [YSP] continues to work, through war, to impose 
secession and destroy the Yemeni unity. Thus, it is high time 
for all our Arab brothers to realize this fact, and they should 
not ignore the presence of a constitutional legitimacy stemming 
from the results of the 1993 elections. 
  Basindwah added: This being the case, no person inside or 
outside Yemen is allowed to violate the Yemeni people's will as 
expressed through the polls. He ruled out the possibility that 
the Yemeni crisis would be discussed during the meetings of the 
foreign ministers of the Nonaligned Movement which will be held 
in Cairo, unless the discussion of peoples' internal affairs has 
become a general right for anyone. 
  On whether the YSP would succeed in consolidating the 
secession of the southern part of Yemen, the Yemeni foreign 
minister said this is no longer possible, especially since the 
Government forces, in addition to controlling three important 
governments in the center of the former southern part of Yemen, 
have managed to impose a complete siege on the places housing 
the leadership of the YSP secessionists. He added that the 
leader of secessionists is now fully aware that his project 
cannot be implemented; otherwise, he would not have fled from 
Aden to Hadhramaut. If this leader finds himself besieged in 
Hadhramaut, he will flee outside the country, he added. 
  Basindwah ruled out the possibility that the fighting raging 
in Yemen will have future negative repercussions on the border 
issues in the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf for the simple 
reason that the fighting can in no way whatsoever turn into a 
long-term civil war. With regard to the message that the Yemeni 
Government is reportedly awaiting from the south, Basindwah 
said: In fact, we are not awaiting any message from the 
Socialist Party. However, what should be cautioned about here 
is the fact that the unionist elements in this party should show 
courage and condemn the secession decision made by 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid if they really care for preventing further bloodshed and 
destruction in Yemen; otherwise, their silence will be 
interpreted as recognition of this secession declaration. 
  Asked about his expectations regarding the fate of the 
Yemeni 
crisis, Basindwah said: "The truth is that the legitimate 
forces belonging to the Government will succeed in imposing 
their control on all Yemeni territory. At that time, the 
legitimate leadership will undoubtedly open dialogue with the 
unionist forces, whether in the Socialist Party or in other 
parties." 
  Basindwah asserted that the legitimate leadership no longer 
needs to storm Aden, knowing that the decision to enter it was 
contingent upon the issuance of a political decision. Now, 
however, we bet that the citizens of this city will definitely 
not allow the secessionists to inflict havoc on them. 
Therefore, I expect that all the sons of Aden will soon arrest 
the leader of secessionists and his clique, Basindwah said. 
  [In a similar interview published on pages 1 and 20 of Amman 
SAWT AL-SHA'B in Arabic on 29 May, Yemeni Foreign Minister 
Muhammad Basindwah states that he is carrying a message from 
Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih to Egyptian President 
Husni Mubarak. The message, he adds, deals with recent Yemeni 
developments. Basindwah categorically denies that his visit to 
Cairo is aimed at meeting with certain YSP leaders there.]

  [Excerpts] Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani, Presidential 
Council member and chairman of the Higher Committee for 
Receiving Donations, has attended a meeting at the Chamber of 
Industry and Commerce in Sanaa. The meeting was attended by 
members of the committee and a host of major businessmen and 
heads of public, mixed and private commercial and industrial 
institutions. The meeting was aimed at discussing the issue of 
supporting the war effort and organizing the process of 
receiving donations and public support for the effort to defend 
unity and constitutional legitimacy and to ease the damages 
resulting from the battles being waged by the forces defending 
constitutional legitimacy, unity, and democracy. 
  Speaking at the meeting, Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani 
explained that the battle being waged by the Armed Forces--the 
forces defending legitimacy and unity against the forces that 
are misled by the gang of apostasy and secession under war 
criminal 'Ali Salim al-Bid--is a battle that emphasizes 
adherence to Yemeni unity and rejection of partition. [passage 
omitted] 
  Addressing attendees, Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani said: 
This meeting is the first step toward public participation and 
beginning of supporting the war effort. He added: Today, you 
will set a good example for the people, who know how able you 
are. If they see that you have made substantial donations, they 
will undoubtedly follow your example and offer whatever they can. 
  Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani stressed that the committee 
is determined to reach every Yemeni in every governorate, 
district, subdistrict, and village to tell them: The door for 
donations is open. Donate whatever you can for the unity of 
your country. Al-Zandani indicated that the committee will 
control methods for disbursing collected donations. It will 
also work to spend donations appropriately. Civilian and 
military war casualties will be supported. Families of martyrs 
will be helped. Those who suffered losses will be compensated 
so as to stress the principle of joint liability. He indicated 
that there will be women's committees to collect donations from 
women. [passage omitted] 
  The Yemeni News Agency, SABA', has learned that the 
donations 
declared at the meeting amounted to 63.325 million riyals.

  [Text] The Sudanese National Democratic Grouping yesterday 
denounced the Khartoum government's seizure of Egyptian property 
and new acts of aggression against Egyptians residing in Sudan 
that threaten the brotherly ties between the two nations. 
  Faruq Abu-'Isa, chairman of the Higher Coordination 
Committee, has confirmed the Sudanese people's intention to 
liquidate the current regime in Khartoum to restore democracy to 
Sudan. 
  Elsewhere, the Sudanese Foreign Ministry yesterday 
reiterated 
its claims that Egypt has no right to protest the confiscation 
of its property in Sudan. An official at the ministry, Anwar 
al-Hadi, said the lease contracts of the confiscated buildings 
had expired and that the property had been handed over to the 
Sudanese Government.

<F P=106> [Report by Hasan Sandarusi: "Algeria: 70 Military </F>
Slaughtered in Sidi Bel Abbess Barracks"] 
  [Excerpt] Washington, Algiers, AL-HAYAH -- The United 
States yesterday expressed deep concern over the deterioration 
of conditions in Algeria, reiterating its support for making 
"serious political changes." This coincides with information 
AL-HAYAH has received in Algiers to the effect that the security 
situation has witnessed rapid deterioration in various parts of 
the country, and that 70 of the military have been slaughtered 
in a massacre carried out in an Army barracks in Sidi Bel Abbes 
province (west of the capital). 
  Reliable Algerian sources told AL-HAYAH that military units 
supported by aircraft moved the day before yesterday to the 
suburbs of Tlemcen, west of the capital, following information 
they had received about the presence in the area of armed groups 
which participated in the attack on the barracks on the eve of 
'Id al-Adha and seized large quantities of arms. Eyewitnesses 
told AL-HAYAH that they had seen helicopters moving between the 
barracks and Oran Hospital. 
  The reliable Algerian sources said that two officers from 
the 
barracks are thought to be implicated in the attack. It is 
believed that they assumed the task of impairing the guards' 
arms (by emptying their magazines) before the gunmen launched 
their attack on the barracks, massacring the soldiers. About 70 
soldiers were slaughtered with cold steel. Soldiers who escaped 
the massacre said the two officers fled with the gunmen. 
  A week after the operation, security forces succeeded in 
locating the gunmen's whereabouts and are currently besieging 
them in Tlemcen suburbs. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Muhammad Kurayshan from Tunis] </F>
  [Text] Today's meeting will discuss the bylaws that will 
organize the work of the Palestinian National Authority. So 
far, 19 out of the 24 members of this authority have been 
appointed. The bylaws will specifically seek to establish a 
democratic course of action and behavior that will allow this 
authority to avoid the mistakes and detours that have prevailed 
in the PLO Executive Commitee's work for years. 
  Yesterday's meeting discussed the program of the Palestinian 
National Authority and its prerogatives. It allocated 22 
portfolios for health, economy, education, and other fields. 
However, the names of those who will be responsible for these 
portfolios will not be known before the end of the current 
meetings in Tunis and, perhaps, not before the authority is 
completely formed. 
  In this respect, informed sources here report that a figure 
close to the Hamas Movement and whose identity was not revealed 
will arrive in Tunis today for further consultations with the 
PLO leaders on the possibility of joining the authority. The 
sources added that Abu-Nidal Mussallami, member of the Central 
Committee of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, 
led by Dr. George Habash, would most probably join the authority. 
  According to sources from within the new authority, the 
apointment of the remaining members of this authority might take 
place at the end of the current meetings, but not necessarily 
so. Consultations in this respect may continue in the coming 
days.

  [Text] The Palestinian National Authority held its first 
official meetings yesterday and today under the supervision of 
its leader, Yasir 'Arafat, and in the presence of a number of 
the most prominent of the Palestinian leaders -- at a time when 
Palestinian and Israeli sources said that Israel has this 
morning lifted the comprehensive security cordon that it imposed 
on the Gaza Strip last Friday following the killing of two 
Israeli soldiers at the entrance to the Strip. 
  Habib Ben Said reviews some of the topics discussed at the 
Palestinian national authority's meeting in Tunis before it 
assumes its duties in Gaza and Jericho: 
  [Ben Said] The participants continued the series of meetings 
today that began last evening and that were especially devoted 
to discussing the issue of distributing the duties within the 
Palestinian national authority, which will assume its 
responsibilities in the self-rule areas in Gaza and Jericho in 
its capacity as the Palestinian government during the 
transitional period. 
  It was learned today that the number of portfolios in the 
government has been limited to about 22 ministries. So far, 20 
Palestinian figures have been appointed to the membership of the 
national authority, the last of which was the appointment of 
Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi, the independent personality in the 
PLO Executive Committee. This appointment was announced today. 
  The Palestinian transitional government is expected comprise 
24 personalities -- as stipulated in the 4 May agreement in 
Cairo between the PLO and Israel. Two seats remain vacant, and 
these are generally believed to be reserved for the Palestinian 
opposition if it wants to join the government. 
  It is worth pointing out here that Palestinian leader 'Abbas 
Zaki is currently holding consultations with some Palestinian 
factions in Damascus to convince them of the need to join the 
government and occupy some ministerial posts in the National 
Authority. 
  On the other hand, it has been said that the participants 
have also discussed the draft charter of a new government. In 
its outline, the draft affirms the necessity to adopt a 
democratic and rational type of behavior, which is based on the 
separation between the powers and the need to make supervisory 
mechanisms available to avoid any extemporization or autocracy, 
bearing in mind that the program of the draft document has been 
prepared by a specialized committee over the past two days. It 
controls the prerogatives of the Palestinian national authority, 
its duties, and the progress of its internal work, in addition 
to deciding the future program for this transitional government 
until elections are held in Gaza and Jericho before the end of 
this year.

  [Text] Head of the United Nations commission disarming 
Iraq, Rolf Ekeus, briefed Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam 
al-Majali on developments and progress of his commission's 
responsibilities in Iraq. 
  The meeting also focused on some of the region's issues. The 
UN official said he was keen on hearing Jordanian assessment of 
the situation in the region. 
  He said there were no major differences with Baghdad on 
monitoring its weapons, and that he expected the Security 
Council to hold detailed discussions in July on easing trade 
sanctions imposed on Iraq. 
  Ekeus said there was good hope that the lifting of the 
sanctions can happen within the foreseeable future. 
  [Begin recording] [Ekeus] I was, and I am very interested to 
listen to the assessment of the Jordanian Government and the 
prime minister of the situation in the region, and especially 
with regard to the problems and developments coming out from the 
Iraqi situation, where we have special responsibilities. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Are your considering to lift 
the 
sanctions on Iraq, or easing it? 
  [Ekeus] This is as I said, there are provisions that if the 
Security Council finds that Iraq has fulfilled all its 
obligations with regard to the weapons, you know, the 
elimination of weapons of mass destruction, and the control of 
the missiles so they can no longer be a threat to the region and 
its neighbors, then the embargo will be lifted, and think its 
good hope that this can happen within the foreseeable future. 
It's up to the Special Commission however to give the Security 
Council the facts for such a decision. [end recording] 
  After meeting with Iraqi head of Military Industrialization 
'Amir Rashid in Amman, Ekeus said the sanctions issue is very 
high on the United Nations agenda. He said he would brief the 
Security Council of the latest developments in two days' time. 
  A UN weapons inspection team, meanwhile, is currently in 
Iraq 
to prepare guidelines for the long-term monitoring agreed with 
Baghdad before lifting the embargo. 
  The team arrived in Baghdad yesterday to join another team 
that flew to Iraq last week.

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Announcer] In Tehran this 
morning, officials and authorities of the Islamic system 
gathered in Imam Khomeyni's mosque, may he be admitted to God's 
paradise, in order to offer congratulations on the occasion of 
the auspicious 'Id al-Ghadir Khumm, the 'id of guardianship 
[velayat] and imamate, to His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, the 
guardian of the cause of Muslims. 
  [Unidentified Correspondent] At this meeting, the honorable 
leader made a speech in which he offered his congratulations on 
the occasion of the great 'Id al-Ghadir to the Muslims and 
righteousness-seeking people of the world, and the faithful 
people of Iran. [passage omitted] 
  His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i described the period of 
reconstruction and repair of the damages caused during the war 
as a sensitive and important stage in the history of the 
revolution. At the end of his speech, he said: 
  [Begin Khamene'i recording] Today is the stage of 
reconstruction. Today the people have the opportunity after a 
long war. For this very same sensitive reason, you can see that 
the world is attacking the productive policies of the Iranian 
people with poisoned arrows from all sides. It engages in 
propaganda, it engages in political games, it engages in 
security provocations, it engages in economic sabotage. The 
enemy does all it can, but thanks be to God, it is not 
successful in the majority of cases. In this era, the thing 
that can make you victorious, the thing that can build the 
nation, the thing that can keep the Iranian people on the 
political scene, the thing that can mobilize all forces in this 
holy path of construction is holding on to Islamic values with 
both hands. [crowd chants] [end recording] 
  [Announcer] Before the speech by the honorable leader, 
Hojjat 
ol-Eslam val Moslemin Hashemi-Rafsanjani, the president, 
delivered an address in which he offered his congratulations on 
the occasion of 'Id al-Ghadir to the honorable leader of the 
Islamic revolution. [passage omitted] Speaking about Imam 
'Ali's appointment, may peace be upon him, as the guardian of 
the Islamic ummah on 'Id al-Ghadir Khumm, the president said: 
The Muslim people of Iran rebelled through relying on the 
principle of guardianship and created the Islamic system. They 
have put the difficult phase of defense and the problems of the 
revolution behind them. Today, by using this very same divine 
blessing of guardianship, while neutralizing the carefully 
worked out plots of the revolution's enemies, it is successfully 
going through the difficult period of reconstruction and 
economic balance. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Speech by President Muhammad Husni Mubarak at the opening </F>
of the National Dialogue Drafting Committee Conference at the 
Presidential Palace--live] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
Brothers and sisters, members of the National Dialogue Drafting 
Committee Conference: For the first time in a half century, the 
whole world, and those of us in Egypt, feel that we are going 
through one of the most delicate and difficult stages of 
transformation in the lives of countries and their people. For 
50 years, the world has lived under constant balance of 
political, economic, and military force. International 
relations, alliances, and affiliations were organized in a 
specific manner and there were patterns which drew the lines 
between friends and adversaries and between common and 
discordant interests. We then found ourselves, along with all 
the countries in the world, with the balances of force changed: 
Enmity turned into friendship and those boundaries were 
obliterated. Ideologies and concepts which governed half the 
world for decades changed. Countries which were noted for their 
domestic stability and leadership abroad were buffeted by strong 
winds of chaos and conflict. 
  Inasmuch as the trends toward grouping grew in numerous 
countries, trends toward fragmentation and division prevailed in 
others. We found ourselves in the welter of a world living 
through a stage of difficult transition in political and 
economic systems and international relations. We in Egypt are 
not living in isolation from what is going on around us, but at 
the same time we are rebuilding our homeland during one of the 
most delicate stages of our historical development, a stage that 
the world perhaps has not seen for centuries. We are seeking to 
consolidate stability in a world buffeted by disturbance, 
violence, and the logic of force. We are struggling to build a 
strong and prosperous economy in a world where the level of 
inflation, unemployment, and recession is rising. We are 
choosing a sound course of democratic practice in a world that 
calls for defense of freedoms while daily it does the contrary, 
prompting people to lose confidence in its credibility. We are 
keen on returning security and stability to the Egyptian man and 
providing him with livelihood and staples at a time when an 
unholy force of evil killers and agents ally to strike the 
Egyptian man's life, livelihood, and stability. 
  Nevertheless, we are going through our current stage of 
great transformation amid domestic challenges, regional signs of 
concern, and the decline of negative aspects in foreign 
relations have failed to weaken our resolve, take us back, or 
prevented us from forging ahead to rebuild modern Egypt, an 
Egypt that is more stable and secure, more plentiful and 
prosperous, more cohesive and harmonious, and loftier and 
leading. 
  The true motive behind my national call to all the sons of 
Egypt was my deep awareness of the need to provide basic 
requirements of national rebuilding in Egypt, whether these 
requirements were political entity, economic structure, social 
establishment, or cultural values. My goal was to prepare the 
groundwork so people could launch initiatives, hold dialogues, 
and exchange ideas. Also so intellectual and academic societies 
could engage in a comprehensive national dialogue to review the 
achievements of the past years, to evaluate present 
accomplishments, and to draw a new map for our sons and future 
generations at the outset of the 21st century. These ideas were 
the goals to which I sincerely aspired when I initiated the 
appeal for a national dialogue. It was not a call for a 
temporary meeting to merely submit papers and then file them 
away. It was a call to work out a sound and developed 
scientific formula to address all aspects of life in Egypt in 
the 21st century and to specify priorities for national action 
in light of the requirement of comprehensive development of the 
Egyptian society in the political, economic, social, and 
cultural fields. It was a call for a formula to orchestrate the 
Egyptian resources with all their significance in the regional 
and international arenas and to safeguard our national security 
and defend the holy land. 
  Since our intrinsic potential is the true mainstay of our 
national security, our sound and enlightened moves in the 
foreign spheres are steered to serve our national interests. 
The planned management of our international relations monitor 
events and developments, adjust to changes, increase our 
friends, contain adversaries and enmities, and deepen 
cooperation and common interests. In foreign relations, we 
believe in, and seek, fair peace and firmly confront and deter 
any danger to our national interests no matter the source. 
  Brothers and sisters, in my speech before the People's 
Assembly, I outlined the following mainstays for national 
dialogue: first, the sound understanding of the challenges 
facing Egypt; second, the meticulous perception of the 
circumstances that govern our regional and external relations; 
and third, the clear-cut delineation of the priorities of the 
national action in the next stage. 
  In my speech on Labor Day, I called for crystallizing the 
objectives which should be expected from the dialogue. I was 
quick to warn against repercussions that might surface as a 
result of the instigators' schemes. These schemes are aimed at 
making the dialogue deviate from its noble goals by mixing 
political action with religion so that instigators would not be 
brought into account. 
  I affirmed that the major objective behind this dialogue is 
to ensure a basic condition of democracy without slipping into 
the chaos of ideas or conflict of stances which could threaten 
the supreme interests of the homeland. I also explained that 
the sound concept of democracy does not mean that there are no 
boundaries between the legitimate law-abiding forces and the 
illegitimate forces that provoke acts of violence and challenge 
law. 
  I presented our specific concept of these legitimate forces, 
because they are the forces which seek to establish a clear-cut 
accord among themselves. The objective of this accord is to 
safeguard the homeland's interests and to ensure that democracy 
will never turn into disorder that would cripple the society's 
energies. 
  I also explained our concept of our democratic experience. I 
said that democracy is not a mold or a form that could be 
applied equally everywhere. Every country has its own 
circumstances, conditions, and experiences that must be taken 
into consideration. I said that democracy is the course of our 
life and our irrefutable choice. 
  I also made it a point to outline the following principles 
of 
this dialogue: 
  1. This dialogue must focus on the homeland's basic issues 
whether they are economic, political, or social issues; 
  2. It must be above party interests; 
  3. It must be based on a scientific and realistic concept 
that would represent the priorities of the national action in 
Egypt; 
  . It must carefully take into account the homeland's 
energies and potentials; and 
  5. This dialogue must never risk the homeland's security 
and stability. 
  Brothers and sisters, hence, my honest call was made for the 
sake of conducting a responsible national dialogue. Stability 
is a guarantee for democracy and there can be no stability in a 
society overwhelmed by infighting and division. 
  Brothers and sisters, if the freedom of opinion and the 
interaction of views constitute the essence of dialogue, the 
participation that is aware of the homeland's rights and which 
is abiding by legitimacy, its constitutional duties, and 
national and political principles, will represent the starting 
point in formulating the scientific concept of future Egypt. 
  Broad participation is the sure guarantee for a rich 
dialogue. It is also the guarantee for the usefulness and 
effectiveness of such a dialogue. However, such participation 
cannot take place without certain basiss to govern its action or 
criteria to control its tempo. The most important criterion for 
participation is adherence to the political standards adopted by 
Egyptian society. These standards have taken root in this 
society's national conscience and mind. They are the result of 
this society's historical heritage and experience over hundreds 
of years and the fruit of its national struggle in its 
contemporary and modern history, dictated by the nature of the 
structure of its civilization and geography when, on the area of 
this ancient homeland, it first established a society that did 
not know racial, religious, sectarian, or class discrimination. 
This is a society in which various groups of its citizens have 
been united since the dawn of time, a society in whose melting 
pot all trends and religions were fused and held together by the 
Egyptian weave. There is no room for sectarianism, nor is there 
any place for fanaticism or class distinction. 
  The second most important criterion for this participation 
is 
adherence to the constitutional standards which the Egyptian 
people unanimously agreed upon when they adopted a republican 
and democratic system as a style and course for their political 
life. This system enables the people to rule themselves, gives 
the law sovereignty, protects freedoms, and sanctifies duties. 
  The third criterion for participation consists of the 
national standards which are represented by the strength of 
belonging and loyalty to this homeland; second, the depth of 
commitment to the goals and significance of public 
responsibility; and third, the performance of duties to the same 
extent as adherence to rights. 
  These, brothers and sisters, are the criteria for 
participation in the dialogue and the political, constitutional, 
and national standards. There are no restrictions other than 
what the homeland and society have approved through their 
historic and cultural experiences. The agreements of the 
nation, which it has reached through all its actions in its 
modern history, cannot be violated. The spirit of consensus in 
the Egyptian nation was a law based on justice, freedom based on 
commitment and responsibility, a right backed by duties, and a 
national, social, and cultural struggle which cannot be 
forfeited or ceded. 
  Within this framework, the national call for participation 
in 
the dialogue was made. We made this call to all social forces 
and economic, social, and cultural institutions that respect 
legitimacy and adhere to the constitution and law, so that 
opinions interact and our internal political and social reality 
is explored to deduce the characteristics of the future. We 
also made this call so that these forces and institutions can 
learn from the experiences of others, pinpoint the strengths of 
other societies and adopt them for themselves; and so that they 
can see the obstacles and stumbling blocs in the marches of 
other peoples, thus avoiding them and keeping themselves and 
Egypt away from such obstacles. 
  The national call was directed at the national and 
legitimate 
forces for them to take the initiative to produce action, not be 
on the receiving end. The future of Egypt is, first and 
foremost, the trust of its sons, citizens, and generations. It 
is not a monopoly of the present generation or the ruling party. 
  The national call was addressed to the professional 
institutions and unions that operate within the framework of 
legitimacy, and to the research centers, intellectuals, 
inventors, and the masses of educated people in Egypt. It was 
not merely a call for participation in decision-making, or 
formulating a program, or polling an opinion; it was a call for 
stimulating energies, driving determination, inspiring the 
minds, and arousing the conscience to give serious and 
responsible thought to the Egypt of tomorrow and the future. 
  Dear brothers and sisters, all of the above are elements and 
parties to the dialogue who are taking part in it by expressing 
their views, offering advice, contributing experience, and 
voicing their opinion. There are no boundaries separating them 
from telling the truth. There is nothing to prevent them from 
being totally frank. Participation with such logic, with this 
objective, under these conditions, and in this way could in fact 
be the correct interpretation of a democratic political life in 
Egypt. Expanding participation based on these criteria and 
proceeding from these starting points provides the proper 
guarantees for a national dialogue in which the sides will take 
part within the constitutional, political, and national 
regulations. The unions and all the forces of Egyptian society 
capable of thinking, expressing opinion, holding discussions, 
and contributing to society will take part in this dialogue. 
  Since this is the nature of this dialogue and its various 
issues, its various criteria and standards, and the sides 
participating in it, the committee tasked with preparing the 
general conference is responsible for translating all this into 
definite concepts and detailed plans of action. 
Responsibilities and duties entrusted upon this preparatory 
committee revolve round many axes. The first axis is to define 
the legitimate national forces within the political, economic, 
social, and cultural frameworks that will be participating in 
the dialogue and which operate under the umbrella of the law and 
constitution. The second axis is to choose the issues and 
subjects around which the dialogue should revolve. The third 
axis is to set and organize the style of action during the 
conference, be that through holding general sessions, or forming 
major committees or specialized working groups. In other words, 
the preparatory committee will define the organizational form of 
the general conference and the rules governing its measures and 
discussions. It will also make recommendations at the 
conclusion of the conference. The preparatory and drafting 
committee will present its recommendations to the general 
conference during its first session. 
  Brothers and sisters, there will always be a standard 
governing all other standards and topping them all. It controls 
all other criteria and rises above them. This standard is, 
above all, a sense of belonging to this homeland within its 
borders, to its history and its heritage; it is a desire to 
protect its security from evil and its citizens from every harm. 
I am very hopeful and confident that there will be a great 
national response in the form of a national call for open 
dialogue to map out Egypt's future and chart its years ahead. 
  The source of my hope and confidence for this national 
response is what I have sensed and seen over the past few 
months. I have noticed large-scale discussion in all clubs and 
forums, in the media, and in research centers of the philosophy 
of dialogue and its concepts, its objectives and various issues, 
its requirements and usefulness, and the various parties 
participating in it. Irrespective of how correct or incorrect, 
real or fake, honest or dishonest things are, we have before us 
today an open book with as many trends as the number of writers 
who have contributed to it and as many opinions as those who 
have produced it. Today, we have the responsibility of a 
historic choice, because today we choose for ourselves inasmuch 
as we choose for the coming generations. We choose for the 
present inasmuch as we choose for the future. 
  The start of a national dialogue today is our way of 
increasing knowledge of the homeland's concerns and mapping out 
the road to achieve its objectives. The start of a national 
dialogue today will strengthen confidence in our abilities to 
govern our own destiny and to plan the programs that will 
transfer modern Egypt from a rising, developing country into an 
advanced state taking a leading position among other states in 
the new world order, the features and landmarks of which are 
still being shaped and reshaped every day. The start of a 
national dialogue today will define concepts, control standards, 
and draw up roles and missions for the homeland and its 
citizens. Through it, amity will prevail and ideas and minds 
will meet to promote this faithful country. 
  Brothers and sisters, this in my opinion is the significance 
and purpose of the dialogue and these are its aims and 
objectives. With all sincerity I frankly tell you that the call 
for dialogue was not a reaction to a national dilemma imposed by 
circumstances--never--or necessitated by modern pressures. Nor 
was it a transient move to conglomerate parties into what is 
being called a national front or national coalition dictated by 
the requirements of what is being termed reconciliation during 
this sensitive stage we are going through. National dialogue is 
a sincere national call that rises above partisanship and 
parties and in which the state, the government, the people, and 
the whole Egyptian society will melt into one system of national 
action for Egypt. 
  I frankly tell you that from this purely Egyptian 
perspective 
our national dialogue is different from other dialogues in its 
nature, goals, and motives. Our dialogue derives its roots from 
a nation that is the best of nations, whose cultural identity 
has never been erased and whose unique character throughout 
history has never been lost. God has given this nation a true 
historic feeling, thanks to which Egypt has never made a mistake 
in choosing the correct course at the correct time. Our 
dialogue will grow and prosper in a society whose forces have 
not fought with each other and whose elements have never 
quarreled. This society has lived on the banks of the great 
Nile in unity, cohesion, and harmony. From the political and 
cultural points of view, it is futile to make comparisons 
between what is taking place in other societies and what is 
happening in Egypt when we open a new chapter of new dialogue. 
The chapters or stages of this dialogue among the Egyptian 
people have never stopped. 
  The launching of this dialogue begins the regulation of the 
movement of society in Egypt for the next years. It will help 
us avoid the past shortcomings that hindered the march of 
society and will glorify the present achievements that broke 
barriers and unleashed capabilities. The national call for a 
comprehensive dialogue on the future of national action in Egypt 
has its perils, significance, and results. But we must always 
realize that the dialogue has three objectives: first, to 
preserve the security and stability of this homeland; second, to 
establish a balance between the citizens' ambitions and the 
potentials of the homeland; and third, to secure broad 
participation in the process of finding solutions to the 
problems of the society and in decision-making. These three 
basic objectives represent a broad framework comprising the 
issues and priorities for national action. 
  In our contemporary world, there are three indispensable 
elements which nations and homelands need to be strong: national 
and social solidarity; economic and material potential; and 
scientific and cultural progress. If these elements are 
lacking, or if any of them collapses, states blunder and they 
stumble in their steps; indeed, they retrogress and end up 
depending on others for security, power, and knowledge, and even 
for aid and survival. 
  Aware of our need for these three elements, we, in our call 
for a national dialogue, proposed that the priorities of our 
national work be as follows: 
  1. Building a strong and prosperous economy as the center of 
economic development, and realizing the well-being of the 
Egyptians as the center of social development. 
  2. Egypt's youths represent its present and future, and 
their issues must top the national action's list of priorities. 
High among these issues are the optimal use of manpower and the 
ability of the labor market to accommodate all job seekers. 
  3. The relationship between the people, who constitute 
Egypt's human wealth and the sources of its development and 
growth, and the country's natural resources and economic 
capabilities must be regulated. That is, a balance between man 
and land must be created so that we can achieve abundance and 
strength. 
  4. Culture, education, and science in Egypt represent the 
triangle of the national project designed to change the face of 
political, economic, and social life, achieve cultural 
development in the coming decades, and to establish links 
between science and society and between education and production. 
  5. Curative and preventive health care for Egyptians is not 
only a state service, but an effort to maintain and preserve the 
dearest and most valuable thing on this good land, namely, the 
Egyptian man in his childhood, youth, and old age. 
  6. Modernizing and developing the administration is the key 
to a successful performance. No matter how generous nature is, 
resources and capabilities are dissipated if there is no modern 
administration to design, plan, implement, and oversee. In our 
modern Egypt, where resources are scarce and population is 
abundant, we, more than anybody else, need a modern and 
developed administration and a firm control system. 
  7. The call to transfer responsibility to a new generation 
of Egyptian youth does not stem from a mere desire for change or 
rotation of power, but is a natural response to legitimate hopes 
for contributions in building the Egypt of the future. 
  Brothers and sisters, the start of the national dialogue 
opens doors to every sincere Egyptian, to every patriotic person 
committed to the security of his country and people, to every 
intellectual knowledgeable of his nation's heritage and the 
people's values, and to every laborer and farmer sweating and 
working hard to water the soil of Egypt so that it can produce 
crops, virtue, and development, and so that Egypt's fields can 
bloom, its desert and valleys can be built up, and development 
can reach every spot in this land. 
  This beginning of a national dialogue, brothers and sisters, 
opens the doors of hope for Egypt's future. We are determined 
to maintain Egypt's security and stability, and we have sworn to 
God that we will safeguard the Egyptian citizen's right to a 
dignified life in which he feels safe about his present and 
future. We have vowed to shoulder this trust and not to 
relinquish our responsibility in defending the unity and 
cohesiveness of this nation and the sacred soil of this 
homeland. We will remain faithful to our pledge to God and the 
homeland. Every engagement will be inquired into on the day of 
reckoning. Peace be upon you.

  [Excerpts] Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz has announced that 
Foreign Ministry Secretary General Zafir al-Hasan will call the 
major powers' ambassadors in Lebanon tomorrow. He will discuss 
Lebanon's request for a Security Council meeting to debate the 
Lebanese complaint against Israel in the abduction of Lebanese 
citizen Mustafa al-Dirani. He said Lebanon expects the United 
States to use its veto power, but the Security Council must live 
up to its responsibilities. He expressed his belief that the 
United Nations could restore its credibility by taking 
appropriate action. [passage omitted] Answering journalists' 
questions, Foreign Minister Buwayz said: 
  [Begin Buwayz recording] Of course the wavering in dealing 
with Israel by the Security Council, the United Nations, and 
several influential and major powers is no longer a secret. We 
are at a stage where numerous Israeli aggressions are 
overlooked. Hence, we believe that the United Nations should 
regain its credibility by taking an appropriate decision on this 
issue. [end recording]

  [Text] Sanaa, May 28 (AFP)--Northern Yemeni tribesmen have 
released three Dutch hostages they kidnapped two months ago, a 
Yemeni leader told AFP Saturday [28 May]. 
  The official, who asked to remain anonymous, said two were 
released late Friday in the Ma'rib region, east of Sanaa and 
were due to leave Yemen for the Netherlands late Saturday. 
  A third was freed 10 days earlier because he was in bad 
health, he said. 
  The three, Wilbert Elderhorst, Gerard Jeuissen and Jac van 
der Gun, were working on a project supplying drinking water to 
the capital Sanaa, when they were seized on March 25 by the Jihm 
tribe. 
  More than 20 foreigners have been kidnapped in the past two 
years in Yemen by different tribes, who use them to put pressure 
on the government to win material gains. 
  All have been released unharmed. 
  Fighting has been raging between rival north and south 
Yemeni 
forces since May 5.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with south Yemeni "President" 'Ali </F>
Salim al-Bid by Nura Fakhuri in al-Mukalla; date not given: 
"Penetration of Aden Would Not Be Easy; I Support Stopping the 
War, Even Internationally"] 
  [Excerpt] [Introductory passage omitted] In al-Mukalla, 
where crows which like Yemen's climate are not much in evidence, 
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT was granted the first interview to an Arabic 
publication by President 'Ali Salim al-Bid since the declaration 
of the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY]. 
  On his assessment of the current military and political 
situations, al-Bid said: 
  When unity started facing problems we sought dialogue and 
the 
quest for solutions with others in a peaceful and democratic 
way, and that will remain our position. When war was imposed on 
us we had to defend ourselves. After the agreement was signed, 
the other side found itself unable to implement it. It was not 
convinced of the agreement to begin with, and that is why it did 
what it did. That did not surprise us because he ('Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih) does not understand that approach. What surprised us was 
the position of the other forces around him, including the 
patriotic forces and influential figures we had a dialogue with 
for long months. How did they agree to go along with him or 
remain silent after what has happened? 
  Despite that, we will continue to offer our grounds for 
dialogue once we finish with this war which was imposed on us 
and in which our army which was in the north was hit. We are 
now defending ourselves in our homes after the intensity of the 
aggression, plunder, looting, and murder reached a climax in 
Abyan, Shabwah, and every other point they [the northern forces] 
reached. Militarily, they have not been able to achieve any more 
than they achieved in the first few days. They are in a 
to-and-fro situation around Aden at a distance of 70-120 km. 
  When we said to al-Bid that the figure of 30 km from Aden 
had 
been mentioned, he replied: 
  If they were 30 km from Aden the city would be under 
relentless artillery fire. Had the city been within the range 
of their artillery, life would have come to a standstill in Aden 
but that has not happened. 
  On the statements made by Yemeni Planning Minister 
'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani and President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih about 
penetration of Aden and al-Mukalla soon if the negotiations 
fail, al-Bid laughed and said: They are welcome to try. 
  On the possibility of penetration and occupation of Aden and 
al-Mukalla, al-Bid ruled it out, and added: Personally, I have 
no problem with penetration. How would he maintain his army and 
occupation if such a penetration did occur? 
  The problem is not breaching a place but keeping it. Would 
he be able to do that? We are at war and war is advance and 
retreat and constant motion, but when the logic of occupation 
prevails then such occupation is rejected. The people would 
reject and resist it. It would not then be a question of 
military balance or of a brigade facing another because the 
people would reject annexation and occupation and everyone would 
therefore cooperate with the armed forces. You should bear in 
mind that it would be very difficult for them to penetrate Aden 
or al-Mukalla, and if they did, the price would be very high. I 
do not believe that they would be able to pay such a price. We 
would resist and it would be difficult for them to pay the price. 
  Are Aden and al-Mukalla considered red lines? 
  Al-Bid replied: Yes, they are red lines. 
  On the initiative submitted to the Security Council and the 
possibility of UN forces moving in to disengage the combatants, 
al-Bid said: I am in favor of stopping the war by any means 
even if that means the entry of UN forces. In this war there is 
no victor and vanquished. The Yemeni people are the only loser. 
  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that over 3,000 fighters have 
arrived in Aden from the camps around al-Mukalla, coming from 
the Shabwah area. They are now being reassembled and redeployed 
in areas from al-Mukalla to Mayfa'ah in the direction of the 
city of 'Ataq. The next few days are expected to witness a 
fierce battle for the recapture of the positions lost by the 
southern forces in Shabwah.

  [Excerpts] Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, chairman of the 
Presidential Council and secretary general of the Yemeni 
Socialist Party Central Committee, visited a number of injured 
yesterday who are to be taken abroad for treatment. This is 
within the framework of the government's concern and interest in 
the heroes of our brave Armed Forces and the citizens who are 
defending the sovereignty of the Democratic Republic of Yemen 
and the dignity and honor of the Yemeni people. 
  The brother chairman of the Presidential Council saw the 
conditions of the wounded and wished them a speedy recovery and 
return to continue their struggle and participate in the 
building of the Republic and its defense. 
  Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid commended the heroic and 
courageous 
steadfastness of our brave soldiers in collaboration with the 
sons of our people in the battle of resistance against the 
al-Ahmar family which imposed this war on our people to maintain 
their selfish and narrow interests. [passage omitted] 
  He assured the wounded that victory would be our ally 
because 
we have a cause. Our heroic resistance would teach the military 
and tribal formations of al-Ahmar family a lesson they would 
never forget. It would breathe its last at the hands of our 
armed forces. He pointed out that the victories achieved on the 
battlefronts prepared the proper conditions for the creation of 
a better democratic future and would put an end to the 
obstructions of those influential forces which wished to take us 
back to the past. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, chairman of the 
Presidential Council, today issued Republican Decree No. 5 for 
1994 concerning a general amnesty for the misled ones 
[al-mugharrari bihim]. The first article of the decree provides 
for a general amnesty for all those who have been misled, and 
who have participated, directly or indirectly, in exploding the 
situation militarily, and in committing aggression against the 
Democratic Republic of Yemen. It also amnesties the sons of the 
areas against which aggression has been committed, who were 
forced by circumstances or concern about their own safety and 
lives to work against the sons of their own areas, their tribes, 
and their state. 
  The second article of the decree provides for the 
regularization of the status of those mentioned in the 
above-mentioned first article, if they join in the defense of 
the Democratic Republic of Yemen, in emulation of their 
colleagues. 
  The third article of the decree states that the decree takes 
effect from the date of its issuance, and that it shall be 
published in the official gazette.

  [Text] Aden radio broadcast a statement this morning by a 
responsible source in the Democratic Republic of Yemen -- which 
has been declared in the south -- denying Sanaa's assertion 
that officials in the Yemeni Socialist Party have proposed an 
unconditional cease-fire in Yemen. 
  The source declared that Aden insists on two basic 
conditions 
for a cease-fire. These are the withdrawal of all northern 
forces to positions behind the previous borders between the two 
parts of Yemen, and the holding of direct talks with the Aden 
government.

<F P=106> [Report by Nadim Kawash] </F>
  [Text] Abu Dhabi, May 29 (AFP) - An envoy from breakaway 
south Yemen said on Sunday [29 May] he expected the United 
Nations Security Council [UNSC] to call for a ceasefire in the 
next few days. 
  "I expect the Security Council to discuss the Yemeni problem 
in the next few days and to issue a resolution calling for a 
ceasefire," the envoy, Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, told AFP 
before flying to Kuwait. "The resolution will be binding to all 
parties and we are ready to stick to it. I think it is in the 
interest of the Yemeni people to halt the war," he said. 
  Al-'Attas, envoy of southern leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid who 
proclaimed a separate state on May 21, met United Arab Emirates 
(UAE) President Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan and briefed 
him on the four-week war. The official news agency WAM said he 
expressed appreciation of the UAE leaders role to stop 
hostilities between the south and the north. 
  Al-'Attas, referred to by WAM as envoy of President al-Bid, 
has also visited Saudi Arabia, Syria and other Arab states and 
will fly to Bahrain after Kuwait. Sources close to him said he 
might later go to Aden. 
  Al-Attas's comments coincided with press statements by UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali that he would send an 
envoy to Yemen after a ceasefire to help reconcile warring 
parties and restore unity. The secretary general said contacts 
were underway among Security Council members as well as with 
Arab countries involved in Yemeni mediation to discuss the civil 
strife and issue a resolution on a ceasefire. 
  "I hope the Security Council will issue a resolution calling 
on the Yemeni parties to halt hostilities and to ask the UN 
secretary general to send a special envoy on a fact-finding 
mission so the United Nations will try to reconcile the two 
parties within the framework of the Yemeni unity," he told the 
United Arab Emirates semi-official daily AL-ITTIHAD. "I will 
assign an envoy who will be trusted by the two warring parties. 
He will start contacts in Yemen once a ceasefire is enforced." 
  Yemen's northern leaders, battling rivals in the south since 
May 5, have rejected any UN role in the crisis on the grounds it 
is an internal affair. 
  Egypt, Saudi Arabia and four Gulf Arab states have asked the 
Security Council to discuss the war and call for a ceasefire to 
pave the way for a dialogue. "From my contacts with the 
concerned parties, they could agree on putting the Yemeni issue 
to UN debate and on a resolution on the crisis," Butrus-Ghali 
said. "If we assume there is opposition from some parties, the 
Security Council has the authority to issue such a resolution. 
But I am hopeful the warring parties will realise that it is in 
their interest to cooperate with the Security Council." 
  He said he had discussed the Yemeni war with US President 
Bill Clinton and sought his support for peaceful efforts. 
"President Clinton agreed in principle that the Security Council 
issue a resolution on a ceasefire in Yemen," he said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, the "newly </F>
appointed prime minister" of South Yemen, by Salwa Sabri in 
Damascus; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Sabri] Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, who has been 
charged with forming a government in the Democratic Republic of 
Yemen [DRY], proclaimed last Saturday, has announced that the 
government will be formed as soon as he returns to Yemen and 
that he is currently having consultations for that purpose. 
  [Al-'Attas] Since the Presidential Council decided to 
entrust 
me with forming the government, I have been having consultations 
with various parties. God willing, we will announce the new 
government of the DRY as soon as I return. 
  The steps taken by the leadership of the southern sector of 
Yemen seeks to end the war and prevent the disintegration of 
Yemen. War is one of the hazards of that disintegration. 
  [Sabri] Which parties will take part in this government? 
  [Al-'Attas] Consultations are going on with a number of 
parties, including the League of the Sons of Yemen Party, the 
National Yemeni Grouping, some independent figures, Nasirites, 
and a number of other parties. 
  [Sabri] Al-'Attas announced that he had gained considerable 
support from the states he visited for the efforts of the Yemeni 
leadership in Aden to stop the ongoing war and resume a 
political dialogue.

  [Text] In an exclusive statement to the MBC Television, 
Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas has stated that the government he has 
been charged with forming aims to end the war and to prevent the 
disintegration of Yemen. He stressed that contacts are under 
way with parties and independent people in the south to form a 
government. 
  [Begin recording] [Al-'Attas] By taking this step, we hope 
to 
prevent disintegration and to maintain the situation that 
existed before unity was established on 22 May 1990, that is the 
existence of two states in Yemen. In light of the bitter 
experience of unity over the past four years we can examine this 
experiment and its problems and mistakes and lay down the 
foundations to make things right. 
  [Question] What is the working program of this government? 
  [Al-'Attas] The main task is first to implement the Pledge 
and Accord Document which enjoys national consensus in Yemen and 
which was endorsed after being formulated by various political 
forces. Within the framework of this task, we must remove the 
effects of the war which has destroyed numerous establishments 
and left a great deal of damage in the hearts of the people. We 
must act to remove these effects. 
  [Question] You have visited the United States, Britain, 
Egypt, and now Syria, did you gain support from these countries 
for your stances? 
  [Al-'Attas] Certainly, in all our meetings in the United 
States, Egypt, and Syria we felt considerable support for the 
efforts being made in the Democratic Republic of Yemen to halt 
the war and address the damage, primarily to end this war which 
is destroying our people and exposing them to the danger of 
disintegration. 
  [Question] Thus, there is hope for establishing a unified 
Yemen in the future. What are the foundations on which Yemen 
must be built? 
  [Al-'Attas] During the national dialogue we emphasized the 
principle that resorting to war would mean striking at unity. 
This war that was declared by the military leadership in Sanaa 
has struck at the Yemeni unity. However, the failure of this 
unity now does not mean that the goal is gone, or removed from 
our national tasks. We must assess the situation, pause, and 
look to the future with optimism. 
  [Question] In Cairo, you requested placing the Yemeni crisis 
on the UN Security Council agenda. What do you expect from the 
Security Council? 
  [Al-'Attas] As an international organization responsible for 
security, stability, and peace in the world, we expect it to 
take the necessary measures and pass resolutions to halt the 
bloodshed and the ongoing war. We have great confidence that 
the Security Council members and the permanent members will make 
a decision to stop this war. [end recording]

still dreams about the south. God be our witness. He who has 
warned is not to be blamed.

<F P=106> [Unattributed "Important Call" to Aden's population] </F>
  [Text] To the steadfast and the patient in al-Mu'alla, 
(?al-Sawahi), Shaykh 'Uthman, Khormaskar, and (?Kuraykar); to 
the worthy unionists: The hour of salvation from the band of 
treachery, treason, and machination -- the gang of apostasy and 
secession commanded by the professional criminal, the killers of 
women, children, and the elderly, 'Ali Salim al-Bid, who, on 13 
January, 1986 ascended to power on rivers of blood in Aden's 
streets and the skulls of your fathers, brothers, and children 
-- is drawing near. 
  Brothers and sisters in unionist Aden: The army of unity, 
democracy, and constitutional legality now stands poised at the 
approaches of the patient Aden to rid you of this tyrannical 
coterie in the Socialist Party leadership and cleanse it of the 
squalor of this mutinous gang that has been fiddling with the 
city and its population, violating sacred values, appropriating 
your freedom and rights, nationalizing your property, and 
authorizing the shedding of the blood of your fathers, brothers, 
and sisters. 
  To the worthy population of the proud city of Aden: Be the 
red-hot spears of unity, democracy, and constitutional legality 
that pierce the chests of the traitors, agents, and plotters of 
the gang of apostasy and secession. Reach out to your brothers 
and sons in the forces of unity and democracy and constitutional 
legality, who are coming to you in response to your unionist and 
patriotic appeal to be saved from this murderous gang that has 
spread corruption and played havoc with the land and people and 
hatched plots against your unity, security, stability, and 
freedom that was restored to you by the young unitary state on 
22 May, 1990, after you had been denied them for the 27-year 
duration of the rule of this rotten gang that can only live in a 
quagmire of repression, terror, agentry, conspiracy, sacrilege, 
disregard for women's honor, and looting and confiscating 
property. 
  Brother officers and soldiers of the military in our 
precious 
city of Aden: In unity lies your dignity, freedom, and 
salvation from the cycle of revolutionary violence. Be the 
first ranks of the soldiers of unity and democracy and 
constitutional legality. Pound the strongholds of the murderous 
gang in the city of Aden, and reduce them to rubble, because 
this battle is your battle, this is your hour, and time is on 
your side. Do not believe the ravings and hallucinations that 
the gang of apostasy and secession has been spewing from Aden 
radio since it took office 27 years ago. 
  Brothers and sisters, fathers and mothers, sons and 
daughters 
in our beloved Aden: The forces of unity, democracy, and 
constitutional legality are jealous of your women's honor, your 
blood, freedom, property, security, and stability, and dignity. 
You are called upon to be the best support and guide for these 
forces. Act as their seeing eye and their hand that hits the 
remnants of the gang of apostasy and secession. Disgrace to the 
forces of apostasy and secession; victory and glory to the 
homeland, unity, and constitutional legality.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the "Yemeni Presidential Council of the </F>
Democratic Republic of Yemen"; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpt] The regime in Sanaa is attempting to use some of 
the sons of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, to mislead them 
and exploit the effects of previous differences, as well as to 
plant strife in their ranks. This is a matter cherished by the 
leaders of the Sanaa regime. All this is done to make it 
possible for the regime in Sanaa to use them in its aggression 
against their areas and people, and consequently deepen the 
wounds of the sons of the same area, the same tribe, and the 
same family. 
  The Sanaa regime does not care about any ideals or religion 
in order to reach its objectives. Will the misled ones accept 
that the honor of their women be violated in their areas, their 
dignity trampled upon, and their possessions looted, as happened 
in some areas? Did the misled ones not think about how they 
were treated before the crisis? The leaders of the regime in 
Sanaa are not above causing strife between tribes and 
personalities in the areas surrounding Sanaa. Money and weapons 
have been provided so that a brother can kill his brother, and 
plant strife between the tribes to dominate them all, instead of 
planting love and affection among the sons of the same people, 
and spending resources on construction and the establishment of 
services. All this is known to the sons of the Yemeni people in 
the north, and this will always be with them until they get rid 
of the leaders of this domineering regime. 
  Everybody knows that the leaders of the Sanaa regime have 
established their regime based on domination, discrimination, 
and arrogance. They look at others as subservient to them, not 
as honorable people. Today they consider their aggression 
against the Democratic Republic of Yemen as a matter of 
occupation and domination, not as a matter of unity, as they 
claim. 
  We wish to confirm to all the sons of our people, and 
particularly those who have been misled from the sons of the 
Democratic Republic of Yemen, that the regime of the Democratic 
Republic of Yemen is becoming more firmly established every day. 
We were the ones who advocated unity, but on the basis of 
equality, justice, democracy, and national unity. In this we 
adhere to the basis of the pledge and accord document, and not 
to the basis of accepting control, domination, imposition, 
corruption, discrimination in citizenship, and the buying of 
people. We aim, God willing, to establish a state of discipline 
and law and order, a state of equality and justice, and a state 
of stability and prosperity. 
  When a regime is established in Sanaa on a similar basis, we 
will unite with it. Our hearts are open and our hands extended 
to the sons of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, to work 
together under a new regime, in which there will be no 
domination by one group over another. We shall build together 
and live together a stable and secure life. This is impossible 
with a regime such as the current one in Sanaa. 
  It is on the basis of the foregoing that we appeal to the 
misled ones, and to all those compelled to take part in the 
aggression against their people and their country, to listen to 
reason and to be aware that their fate and future are linked to 
the fate of their people and areas. The domineering regime in 
Sanaa will not always be there for them, but will use them for 
its domineering objectives and later will expel and humiliate 
them, as is its habit. However, first it will involve them in 
the killing of their people and brothers. There will be nothing 
for them except the Democratic Republic of Yemen, which keeps 
its arms open for all its honorable and patriotic sons to take 
part in its construction and development, and enjoy its 
blessings. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Mr. 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri, the vice chairman of 
the Presidential Council, said that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih had 
begun the secession when he declared the war on the south. He 
said in a telephone call with the Kuwaiti AL-SIYASAH newspaper 
today that it is impossible for 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih to enter 
Aden and that his forces are suffering from the shortage in 
water and foods. He added that the northerners looked at the 
unity as occupation and occupation is rejected. 
  Mr. 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri pointed to the contradictions in 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's stand. He sought for an Arab solution to 
Iraq's occupation of Kuwait in 1990 and now rejects the possible 
Arab solution to the Yemen crisis. Al-Jifri said there is no 
return to the unity with those who look for control and 
occupation, saying that DY [Democratic Yemen] has vast stocks of 
weapons and food supplies, while the north suffers from 
shortages in fuel and wheat. 
  On 'Ali 'Abdaliah's conditions to stop the fighting in 
return 
for cancellation of the declaration of the Republic, al-Jifri 
said: There is no discussion of the cancellation of the 
Democratic Republic of Yemen.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by 'Abd-al-Rahman 'Ali al-Jifri, vice </F>
chairman of the Presidential Council, to the YEMENI NEWS AGENCY 
in Aden; date not given] 
  [Text] The news media of the aggressive regime in Sanaa 
have made it a habit to broadcast statements from some of the 
regime's stooges about contacts the regime claims have been made 
with those it calls the unionists in the Yemeni Socialist Party 
[YSP] and saying that the totalitarian regime in Sanaa is on the 
brink of reaching agreement with them. We wish to categorically 
confirm the following: 
  In the YSP there are no unionists or separatists. All are 
unionists led by Brother President 'Ali Salim al-Bid who worked 
for unity and voluntarily signed the union agreement. The issue 
of contacts with any quarter whatsoever could only be legitimate 
if they are made with the official state establishments of the 
Democratic Republic of Yemen. The Sanaa regime has not made any 
such contacts with any state establishments of the Democratic 
Republic of Yemen. The YSP Political Bureau clarified this 
issue in an official statement issued on 28 April. 
  These allegations by the Sanaa regime are intended to cause 
confusion since that regime has failed militarily and 
politically to achieve its dreams of hegemony, domination, and 
occupation. We are not advocates of war but advocates of peace 
and shall defend the Democratic Republic of Yemen and the lives, 
possessions, and honor of its men and women, its people. We are 
able, God permitting, to do all this. 
  We support a permanent cease-fire to save our country and 
our 
brothers from destruction and bloodletting. This can be 
followed by negotiations between the Democratic Republic of 
Yemen and the Sanaa regime to define future relations between 
the two states. 
  We are advocates of unity but not on the basis of the former 
unity. When a regime emerges in Sanaa believing in justice, 
equal citizenship, human rights and all the ideals we cherish 
and contained in the pledge and accord document, we shall then 
discuss the issue of unity with that regime.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Anis Hasan Yahya Tells AL-SHARQ </F>
AL-AWSAT: The Declaration of Democratic Yemen Does Not Mean 
Abandoning the Cause of Unity"; all quotation marks as published] 
  [Text] London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Anis Hasan Yahya, 
member of the Political Bureau of the Yemeni Socialist Party and 
speaker of the provisional National Salvation Assembly 
(parliament of the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY]), has 
stated that "Democratic Yemen's application to join the Arab 
League is a legitimate and fair step after this war was imposed 
on us. He added that the emergence of the DRY does not at all 
mean abandoning unity. He pointed out that the Pledge and 
Accord Document categorically emphasizes adherence to Yemeni 
unity and the importance of restoring unity on democratic and 
sound basis." 
  In reply to questions by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT about Sanaa's 
interest in holding dialogues with what it called the moderates 
in the YSP in pursuit of peaceful solutions that would bring 
about a cease-fire and put an end to the current crisis, Yahya 
said: "That interest in a dialogue with the moderates is not 
without sinister motives, but despite that, the YSP would 
welcome such a dialogue and is willing to provide negotiators 
who place the higher interests of the people and the homeland 
above all other considerations. 
  He stressed the importance of stopping that destructive war 
and the need for the attacking forces -- a clear reference to 
the northern forces -- to return to their pre-May 22, 1990 
positions. Yahya said that the call for an end to the war was a 
public and just demand. He added that to ensure that and 
prevent more bloodshed and destruction, the northern forces must 
return to their previous positions. Once that is done, he said, 
a call could be made for an immediate start of the negotiations 
without prior conditions, and all issues could be raised at the 
negotiating table and addressed with open minds. 
  [Yemeni Planning Minister] Dr. 'Abd-al-karim al-Iryani said 
the day before yesterday that the initiative presented by 
'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jafri, deputy chairman of the (southern) 
Presidential Council, and Anis Hasan Yahya was "another form of 
secession," and that "al-Jafri has no authority or legitimacy," 
but Yahya reaffirmed the need to stop this war. He said: "What 
is happening in our country is no longer an internal Yemeni 
affair. It is an Arab affair because the effects of the war will 
extend to the region and undermine its security and stability." 
  He called for Arab League participation in such open and 
unconditional negotiations. 
  He said that Arab League states' recognition of the DRY is 
the natural and expected thing but requires the efforts of all 
the Arab brothers to understand the background and dimensions of 
the declaration of the new republic. 
  He added that "such recognition would put a final end to the 
current war in Yemen for which the Yemeni people are paying a 
high price and in which the Yemeni people are the only loser."

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the YSP Political Bureau; place and </F>
date not given] 
  [Text] Statements by 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, the planning 
and development minister, have been repeated for the second day, 
declaring that the battlefronts are quiet in anticipation of 
talks with accredited elements in the YSP. Al-Iryani, whose 
name has been linked with this war and who is one of its 
advocates, planners, and enthusiasts, is sparing no effort -- 
after his artillery war was silenced on different battlefronts 
by the action of the steadfast people and the heroes from the 
army of the Democratic Republic of Yemen and its brave soldiers 
-- to seek new exits and misleading excuses, in view of the 
predicament in which the Sanaa authorities find themselves, 
through convoluted and repetitive statements about negotiations 
with what he calls the moderate group of the YSP. This reflects 
the misleading style northern leaders have followed in the past 
concerning stopping the war and saving Yemen from destruction. 
Instead of responding to calls and patriotic, arab, and 
international appeals, al-Iryani has proceeded to burn his 
smelly incense in the holocaust of death imposed on the Yemeni 
people by him and those like him from among the war advocates. 
  He has been aiming to tear apart the YSP from the first day 
of the union by base methods. YSP militants and the people are 
well aware of these methods, which are well known, and which 
al-Iryani is now using again at this time when the Yemeni people 
are aspiring for a serious stand on the war, instead of this 
deceptive misleading style, which carries with it the decision 
to continue this destructive war. 
  This party, which announced its initiative to stop the war 
on 
the first day that the war was touched off by the Sanaa rulers, 
continues to adhere to its stand, which rejects and [word 
indistinct] the war [words indistinct] by all standards. 
[passage indistinct] 
  The responsibility for the political situation brought about 
by the war must be borne by those who touched it off. The 
party, with its political, social, patriotic, and popular 
allies, will face this situation together in the same manner 
that it rejects the war, which it condemns. It calls for the 
immediate cessation of this war, the withdrawal of forces, and 
peaceful negotiations. Those who imposed the war must bear 
responsibility for it. Those on whom the war has been imposed 
have no alternative but to defend themselves and their homeland 
against the arrogance of the war criminals, who are smeared with 
the blood of the innocent sons of our homeland and great people. 
God gives us success.

not to open fire unnecessarily when our land defenses carry out 
their national duty of repelling the missiles which are launched 
against the populated targets. He pointed out that random

  [Text] Brother Sa'id Salim Ba-huqaybah, the commissioner 
of the province of Suqutrah, has denied allegations by the 
bloody al-Ahmar gang's radio in Sanaa that a public 
demonstration was witnessed in Suqutrah. The radio claimed that 
the demonstration supported Sanaa's legitimacy. Brother 
Ba-huqaybah told the Yemeni news agency, SABA', in Aden, that 
there was absolutely no truth to those claims. The truth was 
that the masses in the province organized a demonstration on the 
morning of 26 May in which they declared their support for the 
establishment of the Democratic Republic of Yemen. He pointed 
out that the participants in the demonstration sent a cable of 
support, in the name of the masses and all the civil and 
military institutions in the province, to the brother chairman 
and members of the Presidential Council, in which they expressed 
their full and absolute support for the young Republic. In the 
cable they strongly condemned the bloody war sparked off by the 
bloody al-Ahmar gang, under the leadership of that ignorant 
shedder of blood, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, against the sons of our 
Yemeni people.

chairman. Following is the text: 
  Your Excellency Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih, Presidential Council chairman, may God keep you. 
[passage omitted] 
  We strongly believe that there is still motivation for 
unity, 
that there will be no future without unity, and that defeat is 
awaiting all those who antagonize it, represented in the 
tendencies that are opposed to unity and democracy. 
  We are fully confident that the unified state is the only 
way 
to confront every crisis and failure in any field. It is also 
the sole way to deal with both large and small mistakes. It can 
contain all negative results of this war and fighting between 
brothers. The values of unity, democracy, and life will triumph 
forever. 
  Unity is the cause of life and destiny for our people in 
Yemen. It is the cause of generations and the future, and it is 
not linked to individuals, therefore, we are confident that our 
people will not allow the reversal of unity and the return to 
the stage before 22 May 1990. [Word indistinct] their strong 
and unwavering faith in unity as a source of strength and 
dignity that concerns their future and development. 
  Finally, we assure you and our people of our principled and 
firm support for Yemeni unity, democracy, and the ambitions of 
our Yemeni people to realize their happy unionist society. 
  We wish your excellency continued good health and happiness, 
and accept our sincerest greetings. 
  [Signed] Your brother President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad

  [Text] Reports from Sanaa say the ruling regime there is 
imposing very strict censorship on the internal and external 
news media to effect a comprehensive media blackout about what 
is going in the country. The regime there has resorted to 
supplying the external news media only with information the 
regime wants published. 
  Meanwhile, reports indicate that the military authorities in 
Sanaa have resorted in the last few days to sabotaging the 
reception boosters of the transmissions of Democratic Republic 
of Yemen television and jamming its radio broadcasting. This is 
to avoid the scandals affecting the Sanaa news media because 
they are broadcasting lies to the citizens and hiding the 
military failures of the Sanaa forces on the battlefronts. 
  It is known that the military authorities issued orders to 
close down the YEMEN TIMES just two days after 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih sparked the war. This was done after the paper published 
information and figures on the number of the victims of the war. 
Amnesty International protested against this step, which targets 
the freedom of the press about which the ruling regime in Sanaa 
boasts. Amnesty International and human rights organizations 
have also protested the demolition of a number of political 
party headquarters, including the Yemeni Socialist Party's 
Central Committee headquarters, which was completely demolished. 
The offices of its Central Committee newspaper were also 
destroyed within the framework of the feverish activities of the 
ruling regime in Sanaa to silence all opposition.

  [Text] The sons of our Yemeni people continue to reject the 
destructive war which the Sanaa regime insists on continuing to 
drive (?large numbers) of youth people into the holocaust of 
death and destruction. Reports confirm that many citizens have 
begun to refuse to send off their sons to the battlefronts to 
fight their brothers in the Democratic Republic of Yemen. The 
regime's organs in Sanaa have resorted to brutal and repressive 
methods such as those used by the military police, which 
subjects those refusing their orders to threats and [words 
indistinct]. In this fashion, the authorities killed the sons 
of a shaykh in al-Hudaydah Governorate as a way of terrorizing 
the citizens and forcing them to obey the orders of the 
repressive authorities in Sanaa.

  [Text] The Yemeni Unionist Alliance Party has stated that 
the house of brother Muhammad Abduh Nu'man, the founder of the 
party, has been stormed and searched in Sanaa. Some of his 
possessions were looted. The statement said this must be 
considered as the beginning of a unique type of terrorism, 
oppression, and arbitrariness. 
  In an official statement issued by its secretariat general, 
and distributed in Aden yesterday, the Yemeni Unionist Alliance 
Party said that it was not really concerned about television 
interviews with some of its members or the issuing of statements 
which did not come from its leadership. It stressed that the 
party ranks everywhere were first for stopping the war and then 
forming a modern union based on the pledge and accord document.

<F P=106> [Report on Sanaa AL-THAWRAH editorial of 30 May; from the </F>
"News Follow-Ups" program] 
  [Text] In its editorial today, AL-THAWRAH comments on the 
attempts to circumvent the Yemeni legitimacy and will. The 
paper says: Some quarters' attempts to circumvent the Yemeni 
will came in the wake of recent national developments which 
proved that the Yemeni state has restored its influence and 
prestige in the face of the secessionists' attempts to exhaust 
the state and weaken its capabilities and authorities during 
these past months of the crisis, which is part of a foreign and 
domestic scheme to exhaust Yemen and dismember its new 
democratic entity. Hence, the suspicious moves are a reaction 
to Yemen's ability to maintain its unity in the face of the most 
difficult and critical circumstances. They are also an attempt 
to reverse the negative results of the unity enemies' wagers on 
dismembering Yemen through igniting a comprehensive war and 
involving the people in a civil strife. However, this attempt 
has ended in utter failure. 
  Yemen has emerged from its bitter experience like the sphinx 
from the ashes. Everyone, here and abroad, has come to the 
conclusion that the unity and the state of law and order are 
neither theories nor slogans intended for boasting. Rather, 
they a realistic and firm fact that possesses all requirements 
of progress, self-protection, and survival throughout Yemen. 
This has been proved by the recent confrontation of the 
secession drama. The entire international community has come to 
realize that the director and characters of this drama are 
thieves and advocates of terrorism. Thus, the unity remained 
while they hid themselves like rats to look for new pretexts to 
destroy this national entity. 
  The paper adds: When Yemen appeared before the world as a 
state with a fair cause, the international community understood 
the peculiarity of the recent events and the intentions of the 
forces fanning the war and the secessionist drive. Those 
forces, after they wagered on erasing Yemen from the map, were 
stunned to see Yemen rising to confront the challenges with 
greater ability than they anticipated. 
  Although the UN Security Council permanent member states' 
efforts have exposed some parties' malicious intentions, what is 
reassuring is that throughout its history, the United Nations 
has never supported any secessionist trend in any country. 
States' domestic affairs are respected by the permanent UN 
Security Council member states. The U.S., British, and French 
representatives' rejection of the draft resolution proposed by 
some states served as a political reprimand. This rejection 
also exposed some parties' desire to punish Yemen for its unity, 
faith in democracy, and respect for human rights. Hence the UN 
Security Council representatives' emphasis on the need to 
respect Yemeni unity, maintain its constitutional institutions, 
preserve the democratic course of the Republic of Yemen, and to 
resolve differences through peaceful means, considering that 
what is going on in Yemen is a domestic affair. In this 
context, brother 'Abdallah al-Ashtal, Yemeni permanent UN 
representative, cautioned that any initiative that does not 
emphasize Yemeni unity and compliance with constitutional 
legitimacy is completely rejected and deemed interference in 
Yemeni internal affairs. 
  Concluding its editorial, AL-THAWRAH says: This serious 
strife has made it clear to the world that in the course of the 
war imposed on Yemen, all attempts of custodianship have been 
foiled. Those who are concerned for the interests of their 
peoples and states should realize that Yemen will devote its 
efforts to comprehensive development now that it has become in 
possession of all that is needed to protect it. We will bless 
others' moves to defend their states' sovereignty and 
development programs. Yemen, which knows the dangers of 
destruction, is fully aware of the importance of development. 
Our entire people are confronting the secessionist war. This 
proves that the entire Yemeni people and their Armed Forces 
totally believe that defending unity and supporting the 
constitutional legitimacy are the only way to secure economic 
and social construction and national development. 
  The will of our one people in the Republic of Yemen and the 
forces of constitutional legitimacy have triumphed. We are well 
aware of the facts of history. It has never happened in the 
history of the Security Council that it supported any 
secessionist movements or groups. Rather, the Security Council 
supported Nigeria's efforts when it confronted a secessionist 
group in the early seventies. It also supported Congo against 
the separation of one of its regions in the sixties. According 
to UN officials, it has never happened in the history of the 
United Nations that it interfered in any country's domestic 
affairs. Yemeni unity has been achieved by the will of the 
entire Yemeni people. If there is a small clique attempting to 
impose its secessionist ideas on the majority of the Yemeni 
people, the Yemeni people have every right to address their 
domestic problems in a manner that preserves their unity, 
security, and stability.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] From the moment the secessionist rebels started the 
fire of the all-out war in Yemen, certain strange positions 
emerged. These positions raise questions regarding the hidden 
intentions and reasons of those who adopted them. 
  The UN Security Council member states have announced that 
they back and support the Yemeni unity. This stand was based on 
the fact that the world community as a whole has recognized the 
Republic of Yemen as a single political entity. However, very 
regrettably, we began to hear whispers, and smell something 
strange, that defy the legal and historical facts regarding the 
formation of the Republic of Yemen from certain countries 
despite their recognition of it. 
  Yemen is not like other countries that have racial, 
religious, and ethnic problems. Paradoxically enough, we hear 
at this stage some people trying to compare the Syrian-Egyptian 
unity to the Yemeni unity. Here, we do not have to list the 
excuses and proof of the invalidity of such thinking. All Arabs 
know very well the difference between Yemen's unity and the 
Syrian-Egyptian unity. 
  But as much as we are concerned for our unity, we the 
Yemenis 
are looking forward to the achievement of the comprehensive Arab 
unity. On the other hand, the Yemeni unity, which is supposed to 
form the cornerstone for a regional and, consequently, an Arab 
unity should win the support of every Arab everywhere. Thanks 
be to God, the brothers in most of the Arab states and the Asian 
and African Muslim states, as well as our friends in Europe, 
America, and Asia--chief of which are the UN Security Council 
permanent member states-- support the Yemeni unity and 
constitutional legitimacy, which exemplifies the effectiveness 
of democracy and political pluralism. 
  Based on the above, we can say that the rebels who are 
pursued by the constitutional legitimacy, the authority of the 
Yemeni unity, are mere gangsters who violated the national 
unanimity. The forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy 
have the right to mete out to them the punishment stipulated by 
the Constitution and the state laws. This is a right of 
sovereignty and no one has an excuse to interfere in the 
internal affairs of the Republic of Yemen since what is going on 
is an internal matter. 
  The position of the UN Security Council permanent member 
states was fair and dominant and it should be followed by other 
countries. It is wrong to think otherwise. It is also wrong to 
view the Yemeni affair as an Arab or world affair. We say this 
despite our appreciation of the concern over stability in our 
country displayed by our brothers and friends. 
  It should be known to those who present themselves as 
sympathizers with the Yemeni people's causes and affairs that 
those who do not respect or appreciate these people's unity are 
mistaken and are taking risks in matters that run counter to the 
Arab League Charter, the UN Charter, and the international law. 
  The Republic of Yemen, which the entire world community, 
without exception, had recognized, is a united political entity 
with no religious, ethnic, or religious problems, and with no 
problems that can infringe on its unity or sovereignty. The 
current conflict is between the state authorities, represented 
by the constitutional legitimacy, and the rebel forces of 
treachery and secession. 
  Our Yemeni people, who are united in religion, language, 
values, traditions, and direction are able to foil all schemes 
regardless of their source. God will grant us victory over the 
gang of apostasy and secession, who rebelled against the 
constitutional legitimacy and the enemies of the Yemeni people 
and their freedom, dignity, and progress.

  [Text] A responsible military source at the Command of the 
Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Yemen has said that 
the ruling Sanaa gang, at the same time that it claims it wishes 
to reach a cease-fire, is continuing its practice of misleading 
Arab and international public opinion. 
  Yesterday evening it fired another ground-to-ground missile 
toward the capital, Aden. The source confirmed to the Yemeni 
news agency, SABA', that our vigilant ground defenses destroyed 
it in the air. Its parts fell in one of the farms in the Lahij 
Governorate, causing no deaths or material damage.

  [Text] Aden, Yemen, May 29 (AFP)--One person was killed and 
four were wounded Saturday [28 May] in a missile attack on the 
southern Yemeni capital Aden, even though the missile was shot 
down, a southern Yemeni military statement said. 
Southern anti-aircraft batteries shot the missile apart, but 
debris fell on the Shaykh 'Uthman district in the north of the 
city, killing one person, the statement said. 
  Witnesses said they heard anti-aircraft fire and a muffled 
explosion and a flash in the sky around 10:30 p.m. (1930 GMT). 
Northern Yemeni forces have periodically fire Soviet-made Luna 
missiles at Aden during the night, but most of them have been 
downed by southern anti-aircraft batteries. 
  Three more dull thuds were heard around 2:00 a.m. in Aden on 
Sunday, although it was not clear what had caused them. 
  Southern Yemen on Saturday appealed to Jordan to intervene 
to 
stop the civil war that broke out between the former North and 
South Yemen on May 5, according to official sources here. Anis 
Hasan Yahya, chairman of the Provisional Assembly of National 
Salvation, the week-old caretaker parliament of the 
newly-proclaimed Democratic Republic of Yemen, sent the message 
to Jordanian parliamentary speaker Tahir al-Masri, the source 
said. Yahya had asked for the "rapid intervention" of Jordan 
with the aim of "stopping the war, returning the warring armies 
to their original positions and starting immediate negotiations 
without preconditions under the aegis of the Arab League," he 
said. 
  Jordan brokered a Yemeni peace accord in Amman last February 
20, but the move to ease relations between the two Yemens, which 
had never fully integrated despite their unification in 1990, 
remained a dead letter. Amman last Sunday reaffirmed its 
commitment to a united Yemen recognised in international law. 
  Meanwhile Yemeni Foreign Minister Mohammad Basindwah, a 
northerner, arrived Saturday in Cairo for the Non-Aligned 
Movement's meeting of foreign ministers, opening on Tuesday. 
Basindwah told reporters he had brought a message for Egyptian 
President Husni Mubarak from Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih about the situation in Yemen. He also met his Egyptian 
counterpart 'Amr Musa, who told reporters Egypt and the Gulf 
states had asked the United Nations Security Council to look 
into the Yemeni civil war. Musa stressed that a ceasefire had 
to be secured to stop the situation deteriorating. 
  UN sources in New York said Oman had on Friday submitted to 
the Security Council a draft resolution calling for an immediate 
ceasefire in Yemen and the renewal of negotiations between the 
warring sides.

  [Text] A military source in Sanaa categorically denied that 
government troops had fired any missiles on Aden yesterday or 
today. The source stressed that only the city's airport was 
targeted by Yemeni Armed Forces artillery. 
  In a statement transmitted today by the official Yemeni News 
Agency, SABA', the source said that the objective of the 
shelling is to prevent the secessionists from using the airport 
to launch raids with warplanes on defenseless citizens and the 
forces of unity and legitimacy. 
  The source stressed that none of the civilian installations 
or residential areas in Aden will ever be a target of the 
artillery shelling. The source explained, however, that all 
military targets in the city are now within the range of the 
unity forces' artillery, which is now engaging them from a 
distance of no more 14 km.

  [Text] A responsible source at the Defense Ministry 
yesterday evening said that the righteous heroes in the valiant 
units of the Armed Forces continue to carry out the tasks 
assigned to them in connection with the field operations on all 
axes and in all sectors. They tightened the siege on all the 
dens of the gang of rebellion and secession, and eliminated the 
obstacles and fortifications behind which the rebel 
secessionists have been barricading themselves. The heroes in 
the forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy continue to 
mop up the remaining secessionist pockets and dens on the Lahij 
axis. They inflicted on the gang of rebellion and secession 
further losses in life and equipment. 
  On the Aden axis, the forces protecting unity and 
constitutional legitimacy pursued their valiant combat tasks, 
dealing decisive strikes against the last collapsing defenses of 
the gang of rebellion and secession, and inflicting direct 
losses on the airbase in Aden airport. 
  The air defenses of the forces of unity, democracy, and 
constitutional legitimacy shot down two aircraft yesterday 
[place not specified] and captured one of the pilots, who 
received first aid and is now being treated in one of the 
hospitals. Another aircraft was shot down over al-'Anad the day 
before yesterday, and another aircraft was shot down on the 
Abyan axis. 
  The hero hawks of the air in the forces protecting unity and 
constitutional legitimacy also carried out several successful 
raids on enemy targets of the forces of rebellion and secession. 
They set on fire and sank two war vessels off the Abyan coast, 
and destroyed two other vessels off the [word indistinct] coast. 
  The valiant Armed Forces units are still carrying out 
mopping-up operations of the remaining pockets and dens of the 
gang of rebellion and secession. All the other axes enjoy 
(?complete) calm.

  [Text] A responsible military source at the Armed Forces 
Command of the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY] has ridiculed 
the lies spooned out by the information kitchen of the al-Ahmar 
family to the news media, the latest of which were what was 
reported by MENA that the artillery of the forces of the 
al-Ahmar gang were positioned 14 km from Aden from where it was 
said to be shelling Aden International Airport. 
  In a statement to the Yemeni news agency, the military 
source 
said the report was not only absolutely untrue, but it was 
further evidence of the bankruptcy of the media of the Sanaa 
gang and a reflection of its political and military bankruptcy. 
Indeed, its lies will fluctuate within a day or two. 
  The source went on to say: We wish to confirm for the 20th 
time that the fighting is taking place in between the two parts 
of Yemen, hundreds of kilometers away from Aden. The foreign 
journalists, let alone the residents of Aden, can confirm that. 
  The military source concluded its statement differentiates 
between artillery shelling and missiles. The military source 
also advised the foreign news media to be precise and seek 
information from reliable sources instead of from the 
information kitchen of the adventurous al-Ahmar family.

  [Text] Aden, Yemen, May 31 (AFP)--Northern and Southern 
Yemeni troops on Tuesday exchanged sporadic artillery fire 
around this southern city, an AFP correspondent reported. 
  The fighting was mainly at the al-'Anad front, 60 kilometers 
(36 miles) north of Aden and Abyan 35 kilometers (21 miles) east 
of the city. 
  Several MiG-21 were spotted taking off from Aden Airport. 
  The fighting continued as the UN Security Council was due 
later in the day to discuss the civil war that erupted on May 5 
between northern forces of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 
those of his southern rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid. 
  Al-Bid proclaimed a breakaway Yemen Democratic Republic on 
May 20, but it has not been recognised internationally.

what is left of his routed armies. Tawr al-Bahah is in flames

holocaust of death. The invaders are dying without being 
conscious of death. 
  Now, at this very moment, a battle is going on in which the 
enemy is registering losses every second and minute. The sons 
of Tawr al-Bahah are steadfast and our Armed Forces, the forces 
of the Democratic Republic of Yemen are, true to tradition, 
inflicting blows against the hordes and the routed remnants of 
the invaders from the land, the air, and the sea. The enemies 
are perishing but they are dreaming that they are advancing. It 
is madness and death. They have no other fate except death. 
  God is Great. God is Great. Victory to the Democratic 
Republic of Yemen.

  [Text] PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat has again referred to 
his agreement with Israel in the context of Muhammad's with the 
Quraish infidels 1,500 years ago. This time, 'Arafat was 
addressing a meeting of Palestinian contractors in Tunisia. 
  Suggesting that the PLO-Israel agreement was only temporary, 
he said that what had happened was not all they had wanted but 
it was the best they could get at the worst time. 
  'Arafat also told Palestinian businessmen that he wants them 
to become economic tigers. He claimed the average of $440 
million in international aid per year was not enough for the 
Palestinians' urgent needs.

  [Text] Tunis, 31 May (MENA) -- PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat 
has noted that what the Palestinian people gained from the 
self-rule accord was not all they wanted but the best they could 
get under the worst circumstances. 
  Addressing the inaugural session of the constituent congress 
of the Palestinian Contractors Federation last night, 'Arafat 
said: The best achievement of the accord is that after 100 years 
we are again on the geographical map and the Palestinian entity 
is being recognized by those who said: "Palestine is a land 
without people for a people without a homeland." 
  'Arafat criticized the donor nations because they allocated 
just $2.2 billion for the West bank and Gaza Strip over five 
years at the rate of $440 million a year. He added that he 
informed U.S. President Clinton that the struggle is over 
whether Palestine should be a famine-stricken area as Gaza is 
now or one of the economic tigers in the region.

  [Text] Jericho, West Bank, May 31 (AFP) -- PLO leader Yasir 
'Arafat has called on members of the Palestinian Administration 
who run Jericho and Gaza to draw up a 100-day emergency plan, a 
member of the team said Tuesday [31 May]. 
  Sa'ib 'Urayqat told AFP that 'Arafat had called upon each 
"minister" to draw up a separate plan for their own portfolio, 
as well as to move to the self-rule enclave of Jericho as soon 
as possible. 
  The PLO chief, who is to head the Authority, is himself 
expected to visit here in mid-June. 
  Twenty of the 24-member team have so far been named, 18 of 
whom have confirmed their participation, and 15 portfolios 
designated, not including the interior which 'Arafat is to take. 
  'Urayqat said the authority would rent a plot of land 
belonging to the Moslem religious authorities to construct a 
building where all the "ministries" are to be housed, with 
financial aid from Spain. 
  When Palestinian self-rule is extended to areas of the West 
Bank still under Israeli occupation, the authority will move its 
headquarters to Ramallah, a much larger town near Jerusalem, he 
said. 
  'Urayqat also said municipal elections would be held in the 
Gaza Strip and West Bank in mid-October, when polling is also 
expected to take place for a 100-seat autonomy council. 
  "If Israel keeps its commitments and withdraws its army from 
Palestinian towns and villages...the municipal elections will 
take place in mid-October," he said.

<F P=106> [Report by Riyad Mansur in Amman] </F>
  [Excerpt] Yasir 'Arafat, chairman of the Palestinian 
self-rule authority has apparently succeeded in drawing a 
prominent West Bank Muslim Brotherhood leader into participating 
in the Palestinian Authority, conflicting with the position of 
the Hamas Movement, which was set up in 1987 from the 
Palestinian organization of the Muslim Brotherhood. 
  Hamas did not deny that this Islamic personality is 
currently 
in Tunis, but emphasized that Sa'id Bilal was fired from the 
Muslim Brotherhood and has no links with Hamas. Hamas said 
Bilal's invitation to Tunis was made within the framework of 
'Arafat's preparations to detonate a media bomb by announcing 
the participation of this person in the Palestinian authority. 
  Hamas recalled how 'Arafat had given Palestine National 
Council [PNC] membership to five Islamic personalities, and then 
reports said that they were Hamas representatives in the PNC. 
Hamas added 'Arafat wants to repeat the same tactic now and 
allege that Hamas is with the Palestinian Authority. [passage

<F P=106> [Interview with Yasir 'Arafat by correspondents Mohamed </F>
Halloub and Nouara, in Algiers on 31 May -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Mr. President, welcome to Radio 
Algiers. 
  ['Arafat] Thank you. I am very glad I can talk from this 
radio and from this Algerian information rostrum which, I can 
still remember, afforded me the first opportunity to give an 
interview to EL MOUDJAHID before I was elected as chairman of 
the PLO. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] In an interview we had with you two years 
ago 
in Tunis, we asked you about the future of the 
Palestinian-Israeli talks, and your answer came in the form of a 
disapproving question [as heard], so what has changed in your 
stance? 
  ['Arafat] We now say (?yes), because what is happening now 
is 
based on the first recognition of the Palestinian people. In 
the past, they wanted to recognize neither the Palestinian 
people nor the PLO, the legitimate representative of the 
Palestinian people. They wanted to give us autonomy, autonomy 
[word repeated in English]. Full stop. Autonomy to the 
inhabitants, not to the land. 
  But now, the decision is the withdrawal -- when we say Gaza 
and Jericho first, this means the withdrawal of the Israeli Army 
from the first Palestinian land, so that it becomes a 
Palestinian liberated land and the Palestinian liberated flag is 
hoisted over this free Palestinian land for the first time in 
this century. Yes, we still have big problems facing us. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, the Palestinian authority 
will 
be organizing elections. Do you expect participation by the 
opposition, and do you expect victory in these elections? 
  ['Arafat] In reality, according to what was conveyed to me, 
my brothers in the opposition -- I cherish this Palestinian 
opposition [pauses] we are a democratic movement, a democratic 
scene; as Voltaire said: I might disagree with you, but I am 
prepared to fight for your freedom of opinion. Our 
constitution, which we announced in Algiers, provides for the 
majority to respect the view of the minority, and the minority 
to follow the decision of the majority. The opposition have let 
us know, in the talks we have had with them, that they will be 
taking part in the coming elections. This is official. Bu at 
the same time, we ask them to come and participate with us from 
now, because this is the homeland of all, and let everybody 
build. They should not leave us for ourselves now, and come 
only when the food is cooked. I have the right to ask them to 
start building now. Let us build together. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] You have mentioned in one of your statements 
the issue of jihad, a word which aroused a strong reaction in 
Israeli spheres. How will you deal with the conditions on 
relinquishing the armed action? 
  ['Arafat] If people think that we are going for a leisurely 
walk [words indistinct]. I know that we are not going for a 
leisurely walk. You should know that every day we have a 
problem. Are you following me? What could one say? Every day 
we have a problem. Every day we have an issue over which we 
disagree. 
  We know that we are not going for a leisurely walk. Did you 
forget the first and second Evian treaties in Algeria? We have 
the same story. [passage omitted] 
  There are secret organizations within the Israeli Armed 
Forces which collaborate with the settlers, just like what 
happened to you in Algeria. Our situation is similar to yours. 
  Yes, we do have problems, and those who think that we are 
going for a leisurely walk, let them know that we are not. Is 
this homeland not worth suffering for? We have paid the price 
of peace with our blood. Our leaders have been assassinated. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, the last question. The 
subject of Jerusalem is one of the challenges facing the 
negotiations in the future. How do you see this subject? 
  ['Arafat] [passage omitted] The Israeli ruler must 
understand 
one thing: That sacred Palestine, Arab Palestine was occupied 
in 1967 and in accordance with Resolution 242, Jerusalem, Arab 
Jerusalem, is part of the Arab and Palestinian territories which 
were occupied in 1967. 
  The basis from which we have proceeded in Madrid, Oslo, and 
Cairo is Resolutions 242 and 338, namely the lands which were 
occupied in 1967 including holy Jerusalem, Arab Jerusalem. Even 
the governments closest to them and their strategic ally the 
United States of America did not accept the decision that Israel 
should include Palestine's eternal capital. The capital of Arab 
Palestine is the capital of the state of Palestine. The battle 
is for it. We know that there are Israeli attempts to bring 
about demographic change. I say to my brother Arabs, Muslims and 
Christians: Jerusalem is not my Jerusalem, it is also your 
Jerusalem. Thank you.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, member of the Palestinian </F>
National Authority, by Sa'id Mu'addi; place and date not given; 
from the "With the Events" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, member of the 
Palestinian National Authority [PNA], good evening. 
  [Sha'th] Good evening, you are welcome. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, when will the PNA members residing 
outside the West Bank and Gaza Strip begin to arrive in the 
self-rule area to pursue their work in order to confront the 
great challenges? 
  [Sha'th] In the next two weeks, God willing. Brother 
President Yasir 'Arafat will be there no later than 15 June. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, in fact, the current picture is not a 
rosy one. The economic situation is serious, and there is a 
great responsibility to be assumed by the PNA. Immediate 
measures should be taken, and any delay will make things 
difficult. 
  [Sha'th] No doubt, we will do our best to resolve these 
problems. However, brother Sa'id, I should say frankly that one 
sometimes forgets why the situation in the Gaza Strip is bad 
following 27 years of occupation. The Israeli Government, as an 
occupation government in this area, was in charge of the Gaza 
Strip for 27 years. 
  The current talk about the difficult crisis is true. 
However, the party that was in charge for 27 years is to be 
held responsible. Moreover, we have been assuming our 
responsibilities only for weeks. I believe this should be said 
to know who is responsible for this situation and how it can be 
resolved. In any case, I am not one of those who lament the 
past, and I believe we should make every effort to build and 
compensate for all these lengthy years of suffering experienced 
by our people in the Gaza Strip. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, what about the financial aid to the 
Palestinians, knowing that the economic situation is the key to 
the agreement's success? 
  [Sha'th] As you know, this aid has been delayed. We barely 
obtained money for the Palestinian police entry [into the 
self-rule area]. However, the greater portion of funds, which 
will come through the coordination committee organized by the 
World Bank, was delayed until the Gaza-Jericho agreement was 
signed. 
  In any case, I believe these funds will come in succession, 
so all salaries can be disbursed on time and the current 
expenses can be managed at least for the first few months until 
we can collect part of the taxes which the Civil Administration 
used to collect before the agreement was signed. I am not 
pessimistic about this issue. I believe that we will fulfill 
all obligations, and sufficient funds will come to meet these 
obligations. What is important is that this should open the way 
for real economic development which will be the key to ending 
the problem of unemployment and create a new situation in the 
Palestinian territory. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, the issues of the Palestinian 
institutions in East Jerusalem and the attempt by the 
Palestinian side to impose political realities were recently 
raised. The prime minister stated that the Palestinians 
committed themselves to establishing institutions in the 
self-rule area. What do you say about this? 
  [Sha'th] I believe there is confusion between the 
institutions which are confined to the self-rule areas in Gaza 
and Jericho, namely, the PNA areas--by the way, the agreement 
stipulates that these institutions will be established in Gaza 
and Jericho and not only in Jericho--and the Palestinian 
institutions existing in Jerusalem before the signing of the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
  These Palestinian Arab institutions in East Jerusalem are 
Palestinian institutions and there was an agreement to keep 
them. During the Likud's rule, these institutions remained open. 
Orient House is not an institution that was built after signing 
the Gaza-Jericho agreement but it is one that was established 
and recognized, along with many other similar institutions, 
before the current Labor government took office. Thus, we find 
it very strange that there is objection to the Palestinian 
institutions in Jerusalem. We regard this objection as an open 
violation of the agreement by all concepts. This is because 
there was agreement that negotiations on Jerusalem's final 
status will be held during the final status negotiations. This 
does not at all allow the Israeli side to behave as if Jerusalem 
was an annexed city at a time when this side denies the 
Palestinian side, which is deeply entrenched in East Jerusalem, 
the right to keep its institutions. This cannot be accepted; it 
is inconceivable that the Likud government permitted something 
that the [Israeli] Labor Ministry has canceled with a pen 
stroke. This remark by Prime Minister Rabin is really strange 
and not understood. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, last question: On the level of setting 
up the PNA, are contacts still continuing with the Hamas 
Movement to join the PNA? Was Shaykh Sa'id Bilal officially 
appointed in the PNA? 
  [Sha'th] As far as I know, no new appointment has been made 
since the meeting held in Tunis. However, I know that there is 
real readiness to expand this authority. There are still six 
open portfolios for anyone who is ready to be committed to the 
agreement we signed and to work through this agreement to serve 
the Palestinian people. In fact, this is the basis through 
which contacts can be made with any of the Palestinian forces 
that are ready to participate in assuming the responsibility of 
next phase. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, member of the Palestinian 
Authority, thank you very much. 
  [Sha'th] Thank you, brother.

  [Excerpt] Gaza -- Major General Nasr Yusuf, commander of 
the Palestinian national security forces in the Gaza Strip, has 
affirmed that no agreement has yet been reached with Hamas, 
because we insist on the surrender of those who murdered two 
citizens the day before yesterday. We have informed the party 
to which they belong about this. 
  He emphasized again that the security forces will pursue 
anyone who kidnaps or harasses any citizen or who tampers with 
the security of the citizens. There is only one Authority in 
the Gaza Strip, and this Authority has been entrusted with 
safeguarding the security of the citizens and punishing those 
who violate the law. 
  Asked whether an ultimatum has been given to these parties, 
he explained that the responsible party has been officially 
requested to hand over those who carried out the killing, and we 
will pursue the murderers. It would be important to us and to 
them if they hand over the murderers, he said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Palestinian security forces in the Gaza Strip 
have detained an Islamic Jihad activist. According to Islamic 
leaders in Gaza the detainee, Hani al-'Abd, is a journalist 
working in a local communications center which is connected with 
Islamic Jihad. Islamic Jihad people in Gaza say that Palestinian 
policemen searched for al-'Abd several days ago. Since he was 
not at home, he came voluntarily to the police headquarters in 
Gaza, where he was detained. Palestinian security elements in 
Gaza confirm that the man was detained. They refused to say 
why, but noted that he is the only person currently jailed in 
the Gaza prison.

  [Text] The first Gaza Strip Palestinian was yesterday 
detained and locked up in the city prison. Palestinian Police 
officers detained Hani' al-'Abd, who is suspected of having 
committed criminal offenses. 
  Al-'Abd, a Jabalyah resident and an Islamic Jihad activist, 
was detained at his workplace -- the Khan Yunus Technological 
College. He was placed in the same cell in which he had been 
held by Israeli security services. 
  In reaction, the Islamic Jihad distributed a leaflet in Gaza 
claiming that Hani' al-Abd's arrest was the beginning of a civil 
war. The leaflet argued that al-'Abd was detained because of 
his affiliation with an organization that opposes the agreement 
with Israel, and not because of criminal charges.

<F P=106> [Report by Zaki Abu-Halawah and Muhammad Abu-Khudayr] </F>
  [Excerpts] Jericho -- Brigadier General al-Hajj Isma'il 
Jabr, commander of the Palestinian national security forces in 
Jericho, has welcomed the decision of the Islamic Resistance 
Movement, Hamas, to stop liquidating collaborators. He said: 
We view this decision with great appreciation. This decision 
will strengthen our national unity and mutual understanding to 
overcome the current problems and frustrate all those who are 
wagering on intra-Palestinian conflict. 
  In an exclusive interview with AL-QUDS, Jabr said that this 
decision will restore to the Palestinian Authority its prestige, 
power, and respect. This is a positive decision that will 
ensure the success of the political process. 
  He affirmed that the Palestinian forces will resort to law 
to 
bring to account any Palestinian who violates security, order, 
or the law. Anarchy will not be tolerated. 
  Jabr expressed surprise at Israeli statements calling for 
moving Palestinian institutions from Jerusalem to the 
Palestinian self-rule areas. He said that such statements 
contradict the provisions of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement, 
which put off the discussion of the future of Jerusalem to the 
final stage. These statements are unilateral and unacceptable 
to the Palestinians. 
  He said that preparations and construction are underway to 
complete the main passage way for the residents of Gaza and 
Jericho. The dignity of the Palestinians will be respected on 
this passage way. [passage omitted] 
  Regarding the preparations for the arrival of Palestinian 
president Yasir 'Arafat in Jericho, Jabr said that preparations 
are going ahead. We are awaiting instructions on the arrival 
date. There are special security arrangements that cannot be 
divulged now, he said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin revealed today that 
the movements of Jibril al-Rujub, head of the PLO's security 
apparatus in Jericho, have been restricted and that he has been 
barred from leaving the city in the wake of his recent 
pronouncements. 
  During a visit to the Bedouin town of Lagiya in the Negev 
last Friday, al-Rujub stated that the autonomy was the first 
phase on the road to the establishment of a Palestinian state 
with Jerusalem as its capital, and that the Palestinians would 
not cease their struggle until Jerusalem has been liberated. 
Al-Rujub also called for the continuation of the armed struggle 
from within the boundaries of the autonomy.

  [Excerpt] Damascus, 28 May (SANA) -- Well-informed 
Palestinian sources in Tunis have revealed that the Fatah 
Central Committee has discussed the subject of Brigadier General 
Misbah Hanafi Saqr, who was appointed by PLO Executive Committee 
Chairman Yasir 'Arafat as head of the Preventive Security Agency 
in Gaza despite evidence that Saqr had connections with the 
Israeli intelligence service. 
  The sources told TISHRIN that Saqr, who went missing in 
1967, 
reportedly drowned in the River Jordan and was considered dead, 
had cooperated with the Israeli Army after the 1967 aggression 
and used to travel frequently to Egypt and Jordan under the name 
of 'Isa [last name indistinct] to bring back information to the 
Israeli intelligence service. When the Oslo agreement was 
signed, the Israelis insisted that 'Arafat should employ him, as 
well as Brigadier General 'Atallah 'Atallah, alias Abu-al-Za'im. 
The Israelis [words indistinct] insisted that one of them 
should assume a prominent and important position in the 
Palestinian police force in the self-rule area. [passage

  [Text] Several shots were fired a short while ago at a 
heavy machinery depot near the settlement of Ganey Tal in the 
Qatif Bloc. There were no casualties. A soldier guarding the 
site returned fire and the security forces launched searches. 
  An investigation revealed that several bullets struck

  [Text] In Amman, Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman for 
the Hamas Movement, has stated that the Movement intends to 
establish a political party in the occupied territories that 
comprises all the opposition forces in the territories. 
  Ghawshah explained that the party will deal with political 
tasks that would be agreed upon and that will be in line with 
the changes and current facts on the ground in the Palestinian 
arena, particularly following the implementation of autonomy in 
Gaza and Jericho. Ghawshah added that this issue is being 
discussed within Hamas, which holds consultations with its 
allies within the Alliance of Palestinian Forces, or the 10 
Palestinian opposition factions which have their headquarters in 
Damascus.

  [Text] Gaza -- One of the leaders of the Islamic 
Resistance Movement, Hamas, has affirmed that Hamas welcomes the 
Palestinian Authority but will not participate in it. The 
statement was made during a visit by Major General Nasr Yusuf, 
commander of the Palestinian security forces in the Gaza Strip, 
to a number of Islamic centers in the area and his meeting with 
a number of Hamas officials. During this visit, Maj. Gen. Yusuf 
expressed his readiness to cooperate on several issues with the 
Palestinian Authority. 
  In this regard, Shaykh Ahmad Bahr, head of the Islamic 
Society, clarified the Islamic Movement's position under the 
Palestinian Authority, and dealt with the issue of the 
collection of weapons from the members of the 'Izz-al-Din 
al-Qassam Battalions. He said: Neither Hamas nor its military 
wing will agree to surrender any of the weapons they collected 
over a period of many years as long as arms-carrying settlers 
remain inside the Gaza Strip. He also explained that the 
self-rule agreement does not compel Hamas to respond to 
everything contained in it, because Hamas does not accept 
self-rule. 
  Referring to the issue of enlistment in the Palestinian 
police force, Shaykh Bahr said Hamas has not directed its 
members to enlist in the Palestinian police.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Oppositionist Palestinian Factions </F>
Turn Down Offer to Participate in National Authority"] 
  [Text] Damascus, AL-HAYAH -- Fatah Central Committee 
member 'Abbas Zaki is making contacts with leaders of the 
Palestinian factions opposed to the Oslo accord to persuade them 
to participate in the self-rule authority. But there have been 
no indications that any of the factions with which he met in 
Amman has agreed to do so, despite the "tempting offer" he is 
carrying. Palestinian sources have told AL-HAYAH that the 
Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) has turned down "Fatah's 
tempting offer during Zaki's meeting with its leaders in Amman." 
And that it reemphasized its refusal to participate in the 
administrative self-rule authority. 
  The sources added that the Fatah Central Committee member 
moved to Damascus yesterday, where he met with Nayif Hawatimah, 
secretary general of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine [DFLP], and Abu-'Ali Mustafa, deputy secretary general 
of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. He 
briefed them on Fatah's position on the Cairo accord and asked 
them to participate in the self-rule authority on the basis of 
shares equal to Fatah's in order to rebuild the negotiation 
process in accordance with international legitimacy. 
  The DFLP secretary general emphasized that the weapons of 
the 
national forces opposed to the Oslo accord "will remain their 
hands and will never be subject to any bargaining as long as 
there is occupation and settlers." 
  Muhammad Nazzal, Hamas representative in Jordan, said that 
the movement has turned down "an official offer" from the PLO to 
participate in the self-rule authority on an equal footing with 
Fatah. Nazzal said that the offer was presented during his 
meeting in Amman with Zaki, "who told me that he had been sent 
by the Palestinian leadership and Yasir 'Arafat personally. He 
offered us participation in the authority on the basis of seats 
equal in number to those of Fatah." He added that Hamas' reply 
to the offer after consideration was "the complete refusal to 
participate in this authority, because the movement is against 
the (self-rule)" accord. It also considers the Palestinian 
authority a tool in the hands of the occupation, not a real 
authority."

  [Text] Cairo, 30 May (MENA) -- Representatives of the 
states making donations to the Palestinian police met here today 
under the chairmanship of Norwegian Ambassador to Cairo Per 
Thelin Haugestad. 
  The meeting was attended by representatives of the United 
States, Russia, Japan, the European Union, Israel, and the state 
of Palestine. 
  The conferees discussed ways to provide financial and 
material aid to help the Palestinian police perform their duty 
in the self-rule areas of Gaza and Jericho. They also discussed 
ways to make the donor states speed up the provision of the 
assistance they have promised and to encourage other states to 
help the Palestinian police. 
  Rami Sha'th, head of the Palestinian delegation to the 
meeting, told MENA that the conferees also discussed the 
equipment and supplies the Palestinian security forces need to 
do their job. 
  High among these needs, he said, is money to pay the 
policemen, provide transport, and buy fuel, communications 
equipment, and accommodation for the force. 
  Mr. Rami Sha'th said that in the first year alone, the 
Palestinian police force needs about $180 million to do its job. 
He said the amount promised by the donor states is much less 
than that needed by the force. 
  He said a three-phased program for the work of the 
Palestinian police has been drafted. The first program, he 
explained, began early this month and will continue until 
mid-June. The second phase extends from mid-June to next May; 
and the third begins in May 1995 and ends one year later. He 
said the aim of these phases is to enable the Palestinian police 
and security forces to perform all their duties in Gaza and 
Jericho. 
  The Palestinian official said the Palestinians have so far 
received 200 American vehicles and technical assistance from 
Saudi Arabia in transporting soldiers from several Arab 
countries to Gaza and Jericho. 
  It was agreed with the Germans to hold a bilateral meeting 
to 
discuss German assistance, which is motorbikes for the police, 
Sha'th said. 
  He said another meeting will be held with the Spanish side, 
which will donate vehicles and communications equipment. He 
added that the European Union promised to provide 10 million 
European Currency Units (about $12 million), 5 millions in cash 
and the other 5 millions in equipment and supplies.

<F P=106> [Report by Aluf Ben and Yosi Torpstein] </F>
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] During his meeting with 
Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin, Russian envoy Viktor 
Posuvalyuk recounted that he had met in Damascus with Syrian 
Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' and with the representatives of 
the 10 rejectionist Palestinian organizations. In Jordan he met 
with Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali. 
  The Russian envoy said that the representatives of the 
rejectionist groups had clarified that they would continue to 
oppose the agreement between the PLO and Israel and not 
participate in the autonomy council. 
  In his talks in Damascus, Posuvalyuk received the impression 
that the Syrians were attempting to portray themselves as being 
in no rush to make progress in the peace process. Syria's large 
debts to Russia were also discussed in the envoy's meetings with 
the Syrian foreign minister; however, no agreement was reached 
on the rescheduling of these debts. 
  Posuvalyuk said that although his government, as well as 
himself personally, would like to deepen their involvement in 
the peace process, Russia was currently preoccupied with its own 
domestic problems and its relations with its close neighbors. 
  The Russian envoy noted that Prime Minister Rabin's visit to 
Russia had been "very successful" and that his current tour of 
Israel would help imbue the framework established during the 
previous visit with additional content. 
  After his meeting with Beilin, Posuvalyuk explained: "I have 
not come to intervene in the negotiations but rather to discuss 
their details with my interlocutors." Beilin noted that 
Russia's involvement in the negotiations between Israel and the 
Arab countries was very important. 
  After the meeting, Posuvalyuk toured Jericho. At al-Aqsa 
camp, formerly known as the Hanan camp and headquarters for the 
Palestinian police in the Jericho area, Posuvalyuk met with 
Brigadier General 'Isma'il al-Hajj Jabr, the police commander 
and with Jibril al-Rujub, head of Palestinian preemptive 
security (a parallel body to the Israeli Shin Bet). The meeting 
was arranged and coordinated by officials at Orient House, the 
Palestinian headquarters in East Jerusalem. 
  At their meeting, which was conducted in Arabic due to the 
fact that the Russian envoy has a doctorate in Arabic studies, 
the Palestinians expressed their hope that Russia, as in the 
past, would continue to support them. The Palestinians also 
reviewed the situation in Jerusalem and the difficulties in 
implementing the Gaza-Jericho First agreement, especially the 
issue of the Israeli settlements and the Shalom 'Al Yisra'el 
Synagogue affair. 
  The Palestinians noted that they had to rebuild the 
infrastructure and institutions in the autonomous areas and 
train a professional work force. Russia agreed to train 
Palestinian security personnel, including members of the 
preemptive security forces. These issues will be discussed in 
detail in the meeting that will take place today at the Orient 
House between Posuvalyuk and Palestinian politicians, including 
Faysal al-Husayni, who returned from Tunis yesterday after being 
appointed minister without portfolio in the Palestinian 
authority. 
  Posuvalyuk said that after meeting representatives of all 
the 
regional parties, he had come to "feel we have all managed to 
overcome the results of the Hebron massacre and must now move 
forward. I am convinced that both the Arab states and Israel 
aspire to promote the process. 
  The Russian envoy expressed the hope that the Palestinians 
"will continue the negotiations and not get bogged down in 
internal disputes. This is the first chance the Palestinians 
have ever had to manage their own affairs and they should 
exploit this opportunity and pursue the peace process." 
  Posuvalyuk expressed the assessment that the peace process 
would not slow down following the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] 
withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho. He said he was 
optimistic about the process, especially after visiting Jericho. 
The Russian envoy opined that the process had reached a stage 
from which there was no turning back. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Amman -- AL-BAYAN has learned that the EC has 
adopted a plan to solve the Palestinian refugees problem in 
Lebanon, and that the EC member states have proposed this plan 
at the refugees committee meetings within the framework of the 
multilateral talks. 
  Palestinian sources in Amman told AL-BAYAN that the Italian 
ambassador to Lebanon has briefed the leaders of the opposition 
factions on this plan, which includes the absorption of 
approximately 100,000 Palestinians academicians in the EC 
states, and granting them the nationalities of these states. 
The plan also includes settling the reamining refugees in 
Lebanon and granting them Lebanese nationality, but without 
granting them the right to participate in elections, in order to 
avoid the disruption of the sectarian balance in Lebanon. 
  These sources added that the actual implementation of the 
plan has begun, and that the Lebanese Government has begun to 
grant citizenships to a number of refugees.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Flow of Western Weapons Does Not Serve the </F>
Peace Process"] 
  [Text] Douglas Hurd, secretary of state for foreign and 
commonwealth affairs, has justified the British Government's 
decision to lift the arms embargo of Israel as a result of the 
encouraging developments in the peace process. To hide the 
reality of its bias toward Israel in making this decision, Hurd 
suggested that Britain is ready to reconsider the arms embargo 
the European Union has imposed on Syria, but only if the 
Syrian-Israeli negotiations make progress. 
  The British decision is strange in more ways than one. It is 
clearly biased toward Israel, since it provides that country 
with the chance to stockpile more weapons within the framework 
of what is called qualitative military superiority, which the 
West in general and the United States in particular have tried 
to secure for Israel over the years in confronting the Arab 
World. It is also strange because this decision is wrapped in 
the slogan of peace. Everyone knows that weapons are the exact 
opposite of true peace and that any progress toward peace 
requires a real decrease in armaments and strict supervision of 
the weapons in the region. These topics are supposed to be 
handled by the multilateral armament supervision committee, 
which came out of the Madrid conference. 
  In fact, the British decision was not the only one that 
contradicts the spirit and goals of the peace process in the 
region. Since the convention of the Madrid peace conference, the 
United States has provided Israel with many guarantees that it 
will enable that country to continue its military superiority 
and will continue to provide it with huge military aid. France 
also agreed with Israel recently to terminate the freeze on 
military cooperation between the two sides. 
  Thus, at a time when the West is hoisting the banner of 
bolstering the peace process in the region, in practice it is 
bolstering Israel's military power, which contradicts the 
objectives of the peace process and the roles the United States 
and Europe are supposed to play. This also strengthens the 
existing doubts that the talk about peace is contrary to real 
intentions. Who needs weapons during the age of peace? Who 
will these arms be directed against? 
  The essential question posed to Britain and other countries 
that are hastening to change their previous stances that were 
based on the major causes of the conflict, foremost of which is 
the Israeli occupation, is: Has the Israeli occupation of 
Palestinian and Arab territories ended? And does taking new 
stances really contribute toward ending this occupation and 
eliminating the reasons for the Arab-Israeli conflict, or are 
they a new contribution by the West to strengthen Israel's 
adherence to the stances that it still proposes to this day and 
that are the major obstacles to a just peace?

<F P=106> [Speech by Egyptian President Muhammad Husni Mubarak at the </F>
Non-Aligned Movement Conference in Cairo; date not given] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate: 
Ministers, delegation heads, guests, and brothers and sisters 
here in Cairo, which is proud of having witnessed the first 
phase of the Nonaligned Movement's establishment and having 
experienced the movement's glory, the Egyptian nation receives 
you with welcome and appreciation. The nation voices its 
confidence in the ability of this pioneering movement to 
revitalize its resources and mobilize its potential to confront 
the growing challenges and changing circumstances to serve 
humane causes and perpetuate the noble values and principles 
that the movement has advocated worldwide. 
  The emergence of the movement in the early 1960's was an 
inspired response to the world situation to ward off dangers 
that faced humanity for the first time. It also emerged to 
fulfill the aspirations of many nations for an international 
community dominated by peace, safety, and justice and free from 
fear and oppression. Thus the movement was able to express the 
ideals and principles that our struggling nations have believed 
in and to which they have clung in their policies and actions 
and to embody the great hopes and concepts that have inspired 
millions of people everywhere to achieve a better future for 
mankind. 
  The great consciousness of our nations and their awareness 
of 
their mission in a world full of danger and challenges combined 
with the piercing and sound vision of the first generation of 
the founding leaders. The movement was established on firm 
bases and managed to achieve colossal accomplishments that 
cannot be erased or eroded by the passage of time. The movement 
undoubtedly contributed to forming the new world order, 
therefore it remains qualified to participate in formulating a 
collective concept for the future. 
  The modern world will testify to the movement's success 
during its more than 30 years of positive work. It has 
succeeded in transforming newly independent developing nations 
into a unique entity with influence in world politics, not only 
because of its numerical or material power but because of its 
constant support for justice and equality. 
  The modern world will testify that the movement struggled, 
along with other countries that shared its belief in peace and 
principles, to defend each nation's rights to eliminate 
colonialism and foreign hegemony and destroy all forms of 
discrimination and oppression everywhere to guarantee the 
creation of an international community on sound bases that are 
able to face danger and challenges. 
  Hence, the movement opened new horizons for nations to 
cooperate in a brotherly way and to learn how to coexist without 
hegemony and exploitation in a mutual sense of the unity of 
interest and fate so that every state can mobilize its resources 
and energy for development and progress. Thus, peace and 
construction triumphs over war and destruction, logic overwhelms 
conflict and dispute, right dominates over force, the value of 
justice precedes the de facto method, and resources can be used 
to set up farms and factories instead of stockpiling weapons and 
tools of destruction. 
  These have been historic accomplishments. It would be wrong 
for anyone to think they were achieved easily and that the road 
toward them was strewn with roses and full of good intentions. 
Rather, they were achieved with strenuous work, bitter 
sacrifices, insistence on reaching the goals, and with the 
ability to maintain a clear vision amidst various storms. Trust 
and historic responsibility require us all to realize that this 
great heritage alone is no longer enough to deal with our age's 
requirements. 
  The tenets, theories, regimes, and relations of the world 
around us have changed as our communities themselves have 
changed from within. In the past, our causes revolved around 
liberating the homelands, but today they focus on liberating man 
in all fields and spheres. In the past, our hopes were for 
independence, but today the hopes are for security and 
prosperity. In the past, we were less in number and strength 
but today we are greater in population, although we are burdened 
with problems and crises. 
  Our only option is to use our strength to confront the new 
reality with an effective and competent body that is adequate to 
achieve the new objectives in this changeable world. 
  The common ground joining us has not disappeared but its 
form 
and substance have changed. Consequently, we urgently need to 
make a continuous and comprehensive revision of the movement's 
progress. We must not revise its principles, concepts, and 
foundations but must reconsider our methods of action, ways of 
thinking, and the way we deal with a new and different world 
order. 
  What we have called for has become an inevitable reality so 
that we could maintain the movement's credibility, emphasize its 
legitimate presence, and guarantee its effectiveness in and 
influence on the world around us. Frankly speaking, unless we 
accept this essential point and move with an open and 
enlightened mind and strength to adapt to new circumstances, we 
will be lending credibility to those who claim that the movement 
has become form without substance. 
  Stagnation represents the road toward extinction. But 
progress and development are the laws of life, or rather the 
definite way toward survival and development. Therefore, we 
must free our supreme ideals from mere empty slogans or 
expressions that are impotent in reflecting reality and facts. 
  Perhaps the changes in the world are moving faster than the 
Nonaligned Movement itself. It is possible that some of its 
foundations have become a part of past history. But this does 
not mean that the movement has lost its role or could perhaps 
lose its way and distort its vision. It means that the movement 
must now deal with the new facts with objectivity, a positive 
approach, and a method based on reality and facts. 
  The world situation that has prevailed over the past era was 
the division of countries into Western and Eastern blocs. But 
the new situation is represented by two poles, the north and 
south. But this situation must exist in an atmosphere in which 
cooperation, not estrangement; and unity, not fighting; should 
prevail. It is important that the Nonaligned Movement's spirit 
should continue to bear the fruit of its efforts. After all the 
successive experiences we have passed through, we stress that 
every member state and people are freely entitled to pursue the 
way of life they desire and the mode of development that fits 
their circumstances. 
  Concerning the foreign policy sphere, the essence of the 
nonaligned method is for every member country to pursue a 
foreign policy harmonious with its independence, its free will, 
and its right to make its own decisions in the framework of an 
international order based on the principles of justice and 
legality, the rule of law, and commitment to international 
charters, notably the UN Charter. 
  The essence of nonalignment is, by its very nature, an 
enlightened philosophy based on a give-and-take attitude and on 
continuous interaction that enriches international thinking and 
seeks the advancement of individual nations at every historical 
stage in line with these nations' particular circumstances. 
  Brothers and sisters, perhaps you will agree with me that 
the 
Nonaligned Movement's response to the new international 
challenges must be in the following two indispensable ways. 
First, the movement must be the representative of the interests 
of the entire developing world. It must draw up the broad 
outlines of the developing world's progress in coordination with 
the group we call the Group of 77. We must always remember that 
the Nonaligned Movement never sought to promote just the 
interests of its own members but earnestly sought to promote the 
interests of all nations, regardless of those nations' diverse 
policies, experiences, and stages of development. Since its 
establishment, the Nonaligned Movement has understood the 
concept of a united human destiny. It has committed itself to 
seeking united human goals by various methods and through 
numerous organizations. 
  The movement's diversity is a source of enrichment and 
strength, not weakness. This enrichment must be increased 
through free, creative relations. 
  The second thing the Nonaligned Movement needs is to enhance 
its ability to begin a real dialogue with all international 
parties. It must be able to address the world in a language the 
world can understand. This dialogue must cover all economic, 
political, and cultural international issues. If the dialogue 
is limited to a few countries, even if they are large and 
populous, it will be futile. All the world's countries must be 
effective partners in the dialogue and must influence its 
course. This is because we are seeking to reach the haven of 
safety together, leaving no country to fall into an abyss of 
backwardness and poverty. 
  Needless to say, the new pattern of world economic ties 
based on groupings, free trade, and the market economy dictates 
that everyone handle this new situation with new methods and 
concepts. The basis of this concept is openness not seclusion, 
mutual dependence not self-reliance, which is no longer useful 
in a world that only has room for people who are economically 
sound, politically strong, socially secure, and regionally and 
domestically stable. 
  This new situation I am talking about has created methods 
and 
bases for economic dealings among all the world's 
countries--north and south--as happened recently in the context 
of a system determined by the new GATT [General Agreement on 
Trade and Tariffs] and the new organization for world trade [not 
further specified]. As developing nations, we have to deal with 
this situation by achieving a balance in interests between the 
developed and developing nations and maintaining the political 
and social stability necessary for economic development. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, let us agree at this meeting on a new, 
clear method for the movement to guide our actions and 
intentions and to consolidate the benefits we have gained 
through our long strife, so that we will not waste our past but 
will take advantage of our present and look forward to our 
future. We must carefully and soundly scrutinize world changes 
to discover what is viable and what is temporary. This is the 
way to deal with these developments, so that we can help our 
movement to adjust and adapt, because adjustment and adaptation 
are two elements necessary to create a driving force that will 
have an effect on the shape of the future. 
  We do not want the movement to turn into a grouping reliant 
on negativity fearful of the emergence of a new world order. 
Our true need is for participation through a joint concept and 
joint action to contribute to devising the features of this 
order. We should take the best of the past system, add to it 
our current experience, and enhance it with strong guarantees 
for the sake of the future. 
  I believe that such an initiative by the movement to 
participate in charting the new world order is the surest 
guarantee of establishing this order on bases of equality, 
justice, respect for each nations' rights, honoring state 
sovereignty and independence, nonintervention in their internal 
affairs, and commitment to the responsibilities and duties 
stipulated in international charters and documents. 
  The Nonaligned Movement, with the solidarity and unity of 
its 
members, is qualified to assume this historic responsibility and 
to positively contribute to setting up a new network of 
international relations through which a just, comprehensive, and 
durable peace can be achieved; a network dominated by security 
and stability, one free of violence and terrorism. Thus, an 
order will be established in which stockpiling of 
mass-destruction weapons will cease and peoples' 
rights--foremost of which are their right to a free, dignified 
life with development and prosperity--will be asserted. It will 
be an order that will end regional wars and conflicts by 
peaceful means--by negotiations, dialogue, and reconciliation; 
an order in which an end will be put to ethnic, sectarian, and 
religious conflicts, in which education will spread and health 
services in all nations will improve and illiteracy, poverty, 
and disease will disappear. 
  This is the road that must be followed so that humanity can 
reach new horizons in progress and liberty without 
discrimination on ethnic, religious, class, or color bases. 
  Therefore, the renewal of the international structure which 
we have known for the past half century is one of the foremost 
tasks in which the Nonaligned Movement must creatively 
participate. We must propose a clear-cut, practical, and 
specific concept for a new structural organization of the United 
Nations, both in terms of its role and responsibility for 
preserving world peace and security and its economic and social 
tasks. This must be done in a way that will reflect the new 
realities and will guarantee the necessary degree of democracy 
in international relations by expanding the participation in its 
bodies and organizations. 
  We must debate things and revise matters and, indeed, must 
formulate a new, fair method that will turn the United Nations 
into a truly international organization that will at the same 
time be as effective as desired. 
  We must put forward a new concept of international security 
based on equality, mutual trust, coexistence, and the 
renunciation of force in international dealings. We must 
realize that we are living in an era where economic competition 
has first priority in international relations. Consequently the 
traditional concept of security becomes insufficient unless it 
is closely associated with economic security and comprehensive 
development. This can never happen unless human development is 
given the priority it deserves in our plans and national 
programs and in our economic and social policies, both on the 
national and international levels. 
  We must also propose a scientifically objective view of the 
way to resolve armed conflicts and regional disputes peacefully. 
Doubtless this particular issue has high priority within the 
Nonaligned Movement, indeed among all countries. Although the 
world has made great strides in eliminating barriers between 
countries and surmounting the hurdles of ideology and 
self-isolation, it still suffers from ethnic strife and border 
and tribal conflicts. 
  It is both honest and courageous to say that the conflicts 
among nonaligned countries have been more ferocious and 
devastating than among other countries. This can cause 
tremendous damage to the movement. 
  It is true that these disputes are not exactly new to the 
Movement but what is new is the fierce fighting and appalling 
destabilization of societies, unprecedented terrorizing of 
citizens, and destruction and annihilation of lives and property 
in the same country. We have seen pictures of such conflicts in 
some European areas which we thought had achieved security, 
stability, and coexistence among their peoples. Perhaps the sad 
tragedies in Bosnia are the best indication to the 
disintegration and setback of a founding (?member) of the 
Movement. 
  What we see in other nonaligned countries in Africa, such as 
Somalia, Rwanda, and Burundi, is not less painful despite the 
OAU's strenuous efforts to stem the bloodshed and preserve lives 
and property. What is noteworthy in this regard is that the OAU 
agreed at the Cairo summit of last June to set up a mechanism to 
settle and prevent disputes and handle crises on the continent. 
Although it is in the first phase of its evolution, this 
experiment is worthy of support by the entire Nonaligned 
Movement provided there is the political will necessary to 
utilize and implement it. 
  If the picture is painful in numerous parts of Africa, there 
is a glimmer of hope for the whole world with the triumph of the 
South African people's will and their application on the 10th of 
this month to join the international community as a democratic, 
non- racial state. 
  This important experiment, which was based on dialogue and 
negotiations among all factions, has been successful in 
eliminating the effects of discrimination between various sects. 
Hence it deserves a double congratulation--congratulations from 
our movement, which supported that experiment, and 
congratulations from the entire world to its people and its 
combative president Nelson Mandela. 
  Wisdom, logic, and reason triumphed and everyone achieved a 
sound democratic victory, which became an example for the whole 
world to follow. Another window of hope was opened with an 
important step taken by the African countries toward economic 
integration when they ratified the agreement to establish the 
African Economic League. No doubt this accomplishment will 
achieve important economic results. It will have far-reaching 
consequences for the economic activity on our African continent 
and on the developing countries in general. It will also have a 
positive impact on the north-south and south-south dialogue. 
  As for Asia, which includes our brothers and partners in the 
Movement, it has not been safe from hotbeds of tension and 
conflicts in areas that ought to be quiet and in which the 
language of dialogue and reconciliation should supplant the 
methods of confrontation and pressure. 
  While saluting the fruitful efforts that settled Cambodia's 
crushing crisis, we look forward with hope and optimism to the 
attainment of stability, peace, and amity between the people of 
the two Koreas in east Asia and among nations in other hotbeds 
of tension in that continent. 
  Similarly it is time for the Afghan people to unite and halt 
the sequence of mutual destruction and killing. Everyone in 
that country must rise to the required level of responsibility 
in a manner befitting the abundant support it was accorded 
during its liberation struggle. Its citizens must now devote 
themselves to rebuilding their homeland and must renounce 
violence and destruction. They must turn their country into an 
oasis of stability and security for themselves, their neighbors, 
and for the friends who supported them during the liberation 
war, instead of repaying some of them with insults and threats. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, it is time for the regions of conflict 
to turn into zones of security and cooperation. The areas of 
tension and instability must turn into domains of peace and 
reassurance and borders must turn into crossing points for trade 
and goods, not remain passages for refugees and displaced 
people. Seas and oceans around the continents must become 
bridges of communication among countries. Their resources must 
become a joint inheritance of humanity to be used to meet the 
increasing needs of this planet's current and future citizens. 
  You know that in the Middle East, after more than 40 years 
of 
bloody strife, we recently experienced one of the most splendid 
days of modern history when the Palestinian and Israeli leaders 
signed the Palestinian Autonomy Agreement. This was a first 
step toward a just solution of the Palestinian issue enabling 
the Palestinian people to regain their rights, resume their 
process of reconstruction, and again take up their mission of 
extending bridges of creative cooperation for the good of future 
generations. 
  Brothers and sisters, parts of the Middle East and the Arab 
world continue to suffer the effects of wars in which many 
victims have fallen and nations have been terrorized. The 
calamities and painful repercussions of those wars could have 
been avoided. It is pointless now to blame this or that party. 
It is much more profitable to pledge earnestly to renounce the 
use or even the threat of force in our relations. We must seek 
to be wise and sober in handling our relations by respecting 
each other's sovereignty, independence, and territorial 
integrity. We must avert the dangers that threaten the security 
and domestic stability of each of our regional countries. 
  The logic of the new world order which we are seeking to 
shape is the logic of reason, wisdom, dialogue, and persuasion, 
not the logic of force and armed power. It behooves us to 
adhere to this logic with the same firmness which we call on 
others to have. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, the long night of suffering and 
hardship is not yet over and we are still waiting for the dawn 
of a new world. Nevertheless, humanity will soon see the threads 
of light. We must seize these threads and weave them into a 
comprehensive human view based on the advocacy of peace and 
stability. We must do this for the sake of progress, 
prosperity, justice, liberty, and human beings everywhere. 
  Let the bells chime the birth of this new dawn. Let the 
light of the civilization of the 21st century shine on a wiser 
and strong- willed Nonaligned Movement that will be able to 
provide a better future for its member nations and humanity at 
large. 
  Make God grant you success and guide your steps. Peace and 
the blessings and mercy of God be with you. [applause]

  [Text] Johannesburg May 29 SAPA -- South Africa joined the 
Non-Aligned Movement [NAM] on Tuesday [31 May] and Foreign 
Affairs Minister Alfred Nzo said SA would like to share its 
special human rights experience with other countries. "We have 
suffered too much ourselves not to do so," he told the 11th 
conference of NAM foreign ministers in Cairo. 
  In a speech released in Johannesburg, he pledged to 
strengthen relations between South Africa and members of the NAM. 
  South Africa's problems were very similar to those faced 
daily by the international community, he said, and with barriers 
removed it could now offer something from its experiences. 
"Although our democracy is still in its infancy, we have already 
made significant progress in overcoming the effects of ethnic 
and other differences and in removing totalitarianism," he said. 
  He thanked the NAM for its work to eradicate apartheid. 
"Your 
efforts were not in vain, and today we can rejoice together at 
the successful establishment of a free and democratic SA." 
  Mr Nzo said SA would also like to share its economic, 
scientific and technical knowledge with other countries in 
Africa and the rest of the world. "Our goal is to establish sa 
as a responsible possessor of advanced technologies." 
  It would further like to act in concert with other members 
of 
the community of nations as a responsible world citizen, and was 
committed to supporting global efforts to deal with sustainable 
development and the environment. 
  South Africa's efforts to relieve poverty, which reflected 
international efforts to combat the north-south economic divide, 
would contribute towards stable and good government, he said. 
  There was a basis for close cooperation between South Africa 
and the NAM. 
  "If we can serve as a bridge to bring the interests of the 
industrialised world and developing world closer together, we 
will know that our struggle has been truly worthwhile," Mr Nzo 
said.

  [Text] Cairo, 31 May (MENA) -- MENA has learned that Iraqi 
Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf objected during the 
evening session of the Nonaligned Movement's [NAM] ministerial 
conference to some things that were said in the speech of his 
Kuwaiti counterpart Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, such as 
accusations leveled at his country. 
  During the session, al-Sahhaf asked 'Amr Musa, chairman of 
the session, for permission to comment on the word "regime," 
which was used in Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad's speech in reference to 
Iraq. Al-Sahhaf pointed out that it had been agreed to discuss 
the basic issues that were listed in the report of the NAM's 
president. He noted that agreement was reached during the 
meeting of ranking officials not to raise the issue of the 
Iraqi-Kuwaiti dispute. 
  He said that the attacks on Iraq in the speech of the 
Kuwaiti 
foreign minister were not listed in the president's report that 
was submitted for discussion during the ministerial meeting. 
Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa then spoke in his capacity as 
chairman of the current session. He said that he had taken note 
of the Iraqi foreign minister's comment. He then asked the 
Kuwaiti minister to continue his speech. 
  In his speech, Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad spoke at length about 
Iraq's non-adherence to the Security Council resolutions on 
recognizing Kuwait's international borders. He noted that there 
are still Kuwaiti prisoners being held in Iraq. 
  The Iraqi minister had told MENA before the session started 
that the issue of lifting the international sanctions on Iraq 
and the damage Iraq is being subjected to would not be discussed 
during this meeting because it is not on the agenda.

  [Text] Cairo, June 1, IRNA -- The Iranian Foreign Minister 
'Ali Akbar Velayati here Tuesday [31 May] outlined Iran's stance 
towards international developments at the 11th session of 
foreign ministers of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). 
  Delivering a speech, he said that despite the existing 
hopes, 
conflicts continue to prevail in international relations and not 
only they have not ceased after the end of Cold War, but have 
also grown in numbers, geographical spread, intensity and human 
suffering. 
  Moreover, Velayati added, the rather arbitrary way of 
dealing 
with these conflicts and crises presents dangerous precedents 
both for international peace and security and for national 
sovereignty and the principle of non-interference. 
  Referring to genocide of Bosnian Muslims as a proof of an 
international disorder and lack of will for putting an end to 
the tragedy, Velayati noted that since Jakarta meeting no 
significant step has been taken in this regard. 
  The Security Council and NATO have adopted an irresponsible 
policy of negligence, silence and at best doing too little and 
too late, he stressed. 
  The foreign minister criticized the Security Council for 
having turned a blind eye even to its own decisions including 
those calling for respect for Bosnia's sovereignty and integrity 
and those denouncing ethnic cleansing. 
  He believed that under these circumstances, it is necessary 
to ensure that the ongoing efforts to find a settlement would at 
least be based on the principles already adopted by the General 
Assembly, the Security Council and the London conference. 
  "Based on past experience, we believe that in order to 
ensure 
the necessary political, humanitarian and military conditions to 
attain these objectives and to force the aggressors into genuine 
negotiations, it is necessary to stop the siege of Bosnian 
cities by all possible means, to lift the arms embargo against 
this country, to remove all the obstacles made for dispatch of 
humanitarian assistance to Bosnians and to intensify the 
international sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro. 
  "We should ask our coordinating bureau and the non-aligned 
caucus in the Security Council, in coordination with other 
concerned groups particularly the OIC contact group on Bosnia to 
move appropriate action in the Security Council and if necessary 
the General Assembly toward those ends," he continued. 
  On the Middle East crisis, Velayati said that the massacre 
in 
the Ibrahimi mosque in al-Khalil and the terrorist abduction of 
a Lebanese civilian by Israeli forces deep inside Lebanese 
territory are clear and obvious cases of state terrorism and 
hostage taking by official forces of the Zionist entity. 
  "In our analysis which is based on the experience of the 
past 
half century in Palestine and other similar situations, the 
attempts aimed at preserving the interests of this regime and 
imposing its illegitimate wishes on the Palestinian people, 
depriving them of their elementary human and national rights, 
cannot bring about a lasting solution to this crisis", he added. 
  The Non-Aligned Movement should play a more active and 
determining role in the process of preventing, mitigating and 
resolving international and regional conflicts and tragedies, 
Velayati underlined. 
  "We believe that the transitional nature of the 
international 
environment requires a continued assessment of the successes and 
shortcomings of the movement in meeting the challenges, in 
maintaining its principles and in making its presence and role 
felt in the international community", Velayati commented. 
  We do not share the now isolated view that with the collapse 
of the bi-polar system, the movement has lost its relevance, he 
noted, adding that although we believe in the necessity of 
enhancing the coordination in the position of the developing 
countries, we find it difficult to go along with the proposal 
for establishing unified Third-World grouping. 
  The shared and common interest of the developing world is 
not 
confined to the fields of economy and development, Velayati 
said. He went on to say that the developing world is facing 
social and political challenges particularly in today's 
transitional period that will determine the future course of 
inter-state relations. 
  He stressed that the world faces fundamental issues and 
problems ranging from a trend to undermine the sovereignty and 
territorial integrity of developing less powerful nations, to 
concern over peace-keeping, peace-making, human rights as well 
as the restructuring of the United Nations and the Security 
Council. 
  Velayati further suggested that the member states of the 
Non-Aligned Movement should develop a more regular and routine 
system of exchange of information and consultations at various 
international fora at the appropriate level. 
  The coordinating bureau and the non-aligned caucus in the 
Security Council are valuable mechanisms which must be utilized 
more effectively and more often, he concluded.

issue of choosing a host country for the Nonaligned Movement's 
next summit has not been decided yet, despite some rumors that 
Iran, Morocco, and Egypt may submit requests. 
  In a statement to MENA, Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar 
Velayati denied that Iran will submit a request if any of the 
Latin American group countries does not ask to host the summit, 
according to the geographical order under which the movement 
operates. 
  Egyptian diplomatic sources said that if there is no 
candidate from the Latin American countries, one of the Asian 
group countries may be nominated to host the next summit.

  [Text] Progressive Socialist Party [PSP] sources have 
stated that Minister Walid Junblatt has received a new plan from 
the Army Command on a broader military deployment as a prelude 
to the return of the evacuees. This plan will be implemented in 
the mountain area between 9 and 15 June. The Army is estimated 
at 5,000 to 7,000 Lebanese troops and will be deployed in most 
of the mountain villages and towns, particularly the villages 
that the evacuees will return to during the summer. The force 
will erect fixed and mobile roadblocks at the entrances of the

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz by </F>
correspondent Randah Habib in Amman -- date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Habib] Mr. Minister, what is Lebanon's stand on 
the settlement of the Yemeni crisis in light of the proclamation 
of an independent state in the south, given that Haydar Abu-Bakr 
al-'Attas has stated that most of the Arab countries will 
recognize this state? 
  [Buwayz] In principle, we do not believe the time is 
appropriate to review the map of the region. From this premise, 
we as the Lebanese Government pause before adopting a final 
stand on what is taking place in Yemen to give the opportunity 
for initiatives to settle this problem. Our hope is that the 
brothers in Yemen realize that the current Arab situation is 
tragic and can do without further divisions and fragmentations 
and further infringement on Arab sovereignty through the 
imposition of international tutelage. 
  [Habib] How does Lebanon view the solution to the 
Palestinian 
presence on its territory following the conclusion of the 
autonomy agreement between Israel and the PLO, and how many 
Palestinians reside in Lebanon? 
  [Buwayz] In principle, there is a consensus in Lebanon among 
all the parties, communities, and forces to reject any form of 
resettlement on Lebanese soil. The Lebanese constitution 
explicitly states its rejection of this possibility. From this 
premise, Lebanon with its limited area, and sensitive structure 
absolutely does not believe that it can sustain the burdens of 
the resettlement of Palestinians on its land. [passage omitted] 
  [Habib] What about their numbers? 
  [Buwayz] There are no accurate statistics. Many Palestinians 
have made statements implying that the Lebanese state is 
carrying out specific plans, proposals, and contacts. I would 
like to state here that the Lebanese state has not contacted 
anyone and has not held discussions with anyone on the 
Palestinian presence in Lebanon and that it is not currently 
carrying out any action dealing with this Palestinian presence. 
Their number ranges between 300,000 and 350,000. 
  [Habib] There is talk about a new tour of the region by U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Will it include Lebanon 
and is there a date for holding the next session of bilateral 
negotiations? 
  [Buwayz] What is certain is that we do not accept being 
summoned to any place outside the Lebanese territory. We 
welcome all those who visit us in Lebanon to discuss the 
problems of the region. Lebanon is an essential part of the 
Middle East equation, whether historically, politically, 
economically, or culturally. We expect that Secretary 
Christopher will carry out a new tour to prepare for a new round 
of negotiations. I expect this. With respect to his visiting 
Lebanon, we have not received, as yet, any information about 
this topic. [passage omitted] 
  [Habib] Is there anything new with respect to the Believers 
Resistance official Mustafa al-Dirani? 
  [Buwayz] Israel carried out an operation deep inside 
Lebanese 
territory. The outcome of this operation was the kidnapping of 
Mr. Mustafa al-Dirani under the pretext of seeking the release 
of an Israeli pilot who was arrested in Lebanon in 1986. Any 
comparison between the two is rejected. Israeli pilot Ron Arad 
was taken prisoner after he carried out a raid on Lebanon, 
during military operations and when the Lebanese state was 
absent. The Lebanese state has no information and does not know 
anything about this topic. The operation against Mustafa 
al-Dirani took place on Lebanese territory, without there being 
any military operations and against a person who was in his 
house and among his family. We view it as an aggression and as 
an act of piracy with all the sense of the word. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Believers Resistance official 'Ali </F>
al-Husayni by 'Imad Marmal; place and date not given] 
  [Text] The kidnapping of al-Hajj Mustafa al-Dirani, one of 
the leaders of the Believers Resistance [al-muqawamah 
al-mu'minah], has focused attention on this group, which broke 
away from the Amal movement but remained faithful to the Amal 
charter, maintaining its own interpretation of the charter and 
establishing close and "special ties" with Hizballah without 
enrolling in its ranks. 
  What are the circumstances of the birth of the Believers 
Resistance, what is its structure, what is its role in the issue 
of the Israeli pilot, and how has the kidnapping of al-Dirani 
affected it? 
  AL-SAFIR posed these questions to Believers Resistance 
official 'Ali al-Husayni, 40 years old, who learned of the 
kidnapping of al-Dirani on Radio London on Saturday morning [21 
May]. He was shocked by the news, particularly because he met 
with al-Dirani the day before and urged him to be more careful 
because there was information that he was being targeted. 
However, Abu-'Ali [al-Dirani], who was only taking 
precautionary measures while moving from one place to another, 
did not increase his guard, believing he would be safe in his 
home. 
  The following is the text of the interview with al-Husayni: 
  [Marmal] How will the kidnapping of Mustafa al-Dirani affect 
the morale of the Believers Resistance and its role? 
  [Al-Husayni] Whenever Israel deals a blow to us, the 
resistance becomes stronger. When Israel assassinated 'Abbas 
al-Musawi, the Islamic Resistance became stronger and 
established roots in the people's conscience. After the 
kidnapping of al-Hajj Mustafa, the Believers Resistance will 
become stronger. Israel will not be glad for long about this 
operation; it will suffer pain as we have suffered. 
  [Marmal] If the authority is directly responsible for what 
happened, given that it is responsible for the people's 
security, what about the internal breach of security and has it 
been identified? 
  [Al-Husayni] From the information we have gathered, it is 
clear that this act of piracy would not have succeeded without 
the help of some agents. We have gathered some information, 
which tally with the other information gathered by other parties 
and the Lebanese Army. We are following up on these leads to 
expose these agents and punish them. 
  [Marmal] Can you elaborate further on this subject? 
  [Al-Husayni] The terrain of the area does not permit the 
Zionist enemy to use it with the help of only pictures and maps. 
There must be some local people who are familiar with this 
terrain. We also had information that the enemy had made a 
miniature of the Qasr Naba village and the hills surrounding it. 
They may have used this miniature to rehearse for the operation. 
  [Marmal] Why were precautionary measures not taken in the 
light of this information? 
  [Al-Husayni] The humble nature of brother Abu-'Ali 
al-Dirani, 
the positive security situation in the area, and the absence of 
direct party activity there made us rely on the state's 
protection. A helicopter landing operation of this size would 
not have succeeded if there was a will by the authorities to 
confront it. 
  [Marmal] Did you obtain clarifications or explanations from 
the military authorities on the way they dealt with the Israeli 
operation? 
  [Al-Husayni] The security authorities, as they said, did not 
do anything because of their weak capabilities. We are not 
accusing the Lebanese Army, which we respect. We paid in our 
own blood to preserve its unity. Al-Hajj al-Dirani is one of 
those who paid a direct price for this. However, I accuse the 
political leadership, who gave the impression directly or 
indirectly that the aim of the operation was possibly to smuggle 
out of the country some of [Samir] Ja'ja's supporters who fled 
toward the mountains. The alert was stronger in the Jubayl area 
than in others. 
  [Marmal] Was al-Dirani involved in the case of Israeli 
airman Ron Arad? 
  [Al-Husayni] The Israeli airman was captured by the Amal 
Movement's Central Security Service, which was headed then by 
al-Hajj al-Dirani. I do not mean here that the prisoner is held 
by the movement. I have no idea who was in charge of the 
prisoner after Abu-'Ali. 
  [Marmal] It is reported that he was handed over to certain 
quarters? 
  [Al-Husayni] This is not true. Such reports are part of an 
intrigue. 
  [Marmal] What are your predictions concerning the fate of 
Arad? 
  [Al-Husayni] He could either be dead or alive. The entire 
issue has become a riddle, as [Hizballah Secretary General] 
Hasan Nasrallah said. Since the Israeli airman is not held by 
the Believers Resistance, the Islamic Resistance, the Amal 
Movement, Syria, or Iran he might have been killed during 
Lebanon's several wars: the war of liberation and the 
inter-Lebanese wars. At any rate, the Israeli airman was 
captured while bombarding Lebanese territory. Abu-'Ali was in 
his house when Arad was captured. You cannot equate al-Dirani 
with Arad. 
  [Marmal] Therefore, you believe that al-Dirani will not give 
new information to the Israelis? 
  [Al-Husayni] Certainly. He does not have any significant 
information. If we had information we would have used it to 
swap prisoners. We are people who treat prisoners well. 
  [Marmal] Are there any contacts with the International Red 
Cross about al-Dirani's condition? 
  [Al-Husayni] We have held contacts with official circles, 
which will contact the Red Cross. It is the primary duty of the 
Red Cross to visit the detainees. 
  [Marmal] What about the political and organizational 
characteristics of the Believers Resistance? 
  [Al-Husayni] The Believers Resistance is neither an 
organization nor a political party. It is rather a movement 
waging jihad. The members and cadres of this resistance were 
members of the Amal Movement. But as a result of an 
organizational dispute within the movement, those cadres became 
members of a Jihad resistance movement in 1988 in implementation 
of the movement's charter. The Believers Resistance has deep 
roots, which is evident in the number of its martyrs. We have 
nothing to do with political parties. We were an opposition 
movement in Amal but now we are not affiliated with it. We did 
not establish a new organization because we are not convinced. 
  [Marmal] What is the nature of your relations with 
Hizballah, 
particularly since there is an impression that the Believers 
Resistance is part of it? 
  [Al-Husayni] Our policies are parallel in terms of our Jihad 
and irrefutable enmity toward Israel. We agree with Hizballah 
because both of us represent links in the world Islamic 
movement. We also have the same Islamic authority. We also work 
together to safeguard Lebanon's unity, peace, and coexistence 
and to establish social justice by eliminating political 
sectarianism. In other words, we are part of the Hizballah 
nation, according to the Koranic interpretation. This is what 
we learned from Imam al-Sadr, because he represented the wise 
authority, which is a descendant of the prophet's household. My 
words should not be interpreted to indicate we are a Shiite 
movement. We are rather a Lebanese movement based on Islamic 
ideology. 
  [Marmal] What about relations with Iran? 
  [Al-Husayni] Iran is a state that champions justice. We 
appreciate Iran's moral and other kinds of assistance. The 
resistance, whether it is the faithful or Islamic, is willing to 
accept assistance from any state that is hostile to Israel.

  [Text] According to reports from the areas of Hasbayya and 
Jazzin, the Israeli occupation forces have started to 
disseminate information on an impending withdrawal from these 
two areas, which could be done suddenly sometime within the next 
two months. 
  The NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY [NNA] correspondent in al-Nabatiyah 
has reported that the information coincides with the completion 
of the road that the occupation forces recently dug between Jisr 
al-Khardali and Tallat Khazin in the Jazzin area and the 
creation of an iron gate in Tallat Khazin. The correspondent 
added that this Israeli step may indicate that a new crossing 
point will be set up there in lieu of the Kafr Huna-Batir 
crossing. Other information indicates that the Kafr Tibnit 
crossing will be removed and that crossing will be restricted to 
Tallat Khazin after the withdrawal from Jazzin, the 
correspondent said. 
  The NNA correspondent pointed out that the construction of 
the new crossing point coincides with the Israelis' evacuation 
from their last position on Tallat al-Ahmadiyah in Hasbayya, 
which overlooks Western al-Biqa', and the handing over of all 
their positions to the agent militia 20 days ago. 
  The correspondent cited sources in the area as saying that 
should this withdrawal be carried out, the town of Jazzin and 
nearby villages--including 'Aramta, al-'Ayshiyah, al-Qatranah, 
and al-Surayri--will return to the legitimate authority's 
control and that the Sidon-Mashgharah road will be reopened via 
Jazzin.

  [Text] Al-Waht, Yemen, May 31 (AFP) -- Southern Yemeni 
troops repelled an assault by northern tanks on a village near 
the south's stronghold of Aden on Tuesday [31 May], a 
correspondent reported. 
  Two tank crewmen were killed and 12 captured, while a 
southern civilian also died and 10 others were injured, 
according to an Aden television reporter also at the scene. 
  A T-54 tank was overturned at the entrance to the village of 
al-Waht, 20 kilometres (12 miles) from Aden. Black smoke 
emerged from three other tanks outside Waht. 
  Southern soldiers and militiamen, backed by Mil MI-8 
helicopters, raked the area with RPG-7 rocket and automatic 
weapons fire, while northern artillery on the nearby Subbayhah 
Mountains provided cover for the retreating tanks. 
  Northern forces have opened new fronts in their four-week 
war 
to capture Aden, with fierce fighting around villages northwest 
of the port city, a military spokesman and correspondents said.

Forces of the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY] has just stated 
the following: With rare heroism and courage, our Armed Forces 
have struck crushing blows against the aggressive, invading 
forces of the al-Ahmar gang on the [words indistinct] front at 
Tawr al-Bahah, and al-Turbah, forcing them to retreat and 
surrender. The aggressors are now fleeing, under fire from our 
fighter aircraft, artillery, and ground forces. Our heroic 
fighters enjoy high morale, and effective, broad support and 
participation from the masses, who have rallied round their 
Armed Forces -- which are faithfully defending the DRY. God is 
great. God is great.

  [Text] A responsible source in the command of the Armed 
Forces of the Democratic Republic of Yemen has issued the 
following statement: In an open and dangerous provocation 
against all Arab and international efforts to stop the shedding 
of Yemeni blood and destruction of Yemeni property, to which the 
Yemeni people are being exposed as a result of the destructive, 
total war declared against them by the leader of the bloody 
al-Ahmar gang, the forces of the al-Ahmar gang have (?resumed) 
their aggressive operations and military attacks. They have 
begun frantically shelling and launching missiles on all fronts 
[words indistinct] at our people, who have refused to submit to 
ahmarist domination and [word indistinct]. 
  Currently, fierce, [word indistinct] battles are being 
fought 
on all fronts between our heroic and steadfast defending forces 
and the aggressive invading forces, who were pushed into battle 
by the forces of the gang of the adventurist and bloody al-Ahmar 
in Abyan, Shabwah and in the direction of Kirsh, Bab al-Mandeb, 
(?Sa'id), and [words indistinct]. As for the al-Turbah front, 
this is the most heroic and fiercely fought over front contested 
by the al-Ahmar gang, [word indistinct] as an expression and 
[word indistinct] of the gang's absolute rejection of all good 
Arab and international [word indistinct] to bring about a 
cease-fire, stop the bloodshed and destruction against our 
people in the DRY [Democratic Republic of Yemen], since 27 
April. The command of the Armed Forces of the DRY reaffirms 
that our heroic Armed Forces, (?supported by) the loyal masses 
of the people, (?will repel) this new aggression [words 
indistinct]. God is great. Victory is our ally.

  [Text] A responsible source from the command of the Armed 
Forces of the Democratic Repubic of Yemen [DRY] commented on the 
statements made by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and broadcast by Sanaa 
radio, which were given out to foreign media, which reported 
that his forces were currently advancing on Hadramawt to mop up 
what he described as the last pockets of the gang of apostasy 
and secession. 
  The source commented: We are disgusted to hear in these 
statements what does not fatten or satisfy hunger [Koranic 
verse]. We inform the public that the war being fought in our 
country today enters its second month, and that the forces of 
the DRY are steadfast, delivering successive blows against the 
forces of 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih on all fronts. 
  The source said battles are currently being fought in 
Shabwah 
Governorate, hundreds of kilometres away from the Governorate of 
Hadramawt, which 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih only dreams of reaching. 
This he can do only if his forces can burrow underground until 
they get to Hadramawt. The source stressed that the masses of 
the Shabwah Governorate and our Armed Forces are supported by 
the masses of the Ma'rib Governorate, and that between them they 
are delivering successive blows against the forces of 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih and are forcing them into retreat and surrender.

  [Excerpt] A responsible source in the command of the Armed 
Forces of the Democratic Republic of Yemen has expressed 
astonishment and deep regret over what was reported by the 
media, quoting 'Abd-al-Qadir Ba Jammal, who shamelessely stated 
that the Sanaa regime's forces had drawn close to the Lahijj 
Governorate's supply of drinking water and was about to capture 
it. What concerns us here is to refute the report, which 
conflicts with the facts of battles being fought far away, 
toward the Tawr al-Bahah, al-Khattabiyyah, and al-Turbah areas, 
where our heroic forces have delivered crushing blows against 
the invading forces. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with MBC correspondent Tawfiq Jazulit in Aden by </F>
MBC announcer Antoine 'Awn in London -- live] 
  [Text] ['Awn] Tawfiq, good evening. We have heard the 
latest reports that fierce battles are waging about 20 
kilometers from Aden and that the northerners have confirmed 
that they have taken control of al-Waht, so that Aden is now 
within range of their artillery. What information do you have? 
  [Jazulit] First of all, as you might have heard, there is a 
batch of tanks leaving their base in the direction of the 
al-'Anad area. As for the information you have, I cannot 
confirm it either way. All we know is that fierce battles are 
continuing on all the fronts, with the exception of the Abyan 
axis. If it is true that this area has fallen, we will visit it 
tomorrow to confirm it. 
  ['Awn] Some Yemeni officials have been touring the Gulf 
states. The most recent has been by Mr. Haydar Abu-Bakr 
al-'Attas to Qatar. Is Aden expecting recognition from the Gulf? 
  [Jazulit] First of all, I wish to tell you that Engineer 
Haydar al-'Attas arrived at Aden airport this evening at around 
2130 Aden time. He was accompanied by 'Abd-al-Qawi al-Makkawi, 
who is considered a member of the Presidential Council in the 
new state here in Aden. He was received by the vice president 
and a group of Yemeni Socialist Party members. Upon his 
arrival, I spoke to him. He confirmed two facts: First, that the 
Arab Gulf states understand very well the crisis Yemen is going 
through. He also affirmed that he is expecting recognition of 
their new state soon by the Arabian Gulf states. 
  ['Awn] As you know Tawfiq, the members of the Security 
Council are holding consultations tonight to stop the fighting 
in Yemen and find a formula for a solution. What does Aden 
expect the international community to do for it? 
  [Jazulit] I think that Aden believes international 
interests, and Western ones in particular, will soon be in 
danger since the war has now developed into a war of attrition. 
Proceeding from this perspective, I know that Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz 
al-Dali, who was accompanying the southern Yemeni prime minister 
during his tour of the Arabian Gulf states, did not return to 
Aden but left directly from Qatar for New York to participate in 
developments in the United Nations' corridors. The new prime 
minister here in Aden told me that they are very optimistic that 
a resolution will be issued stipulating the need to stop all 
fighting in Yemen. 
  ['Awn] Tawfiq, thank you. We will stay in touch with for 
further details. 
  [Jazulit] Thank you.

  [Text] Aden, June 1 (AFP) -- A missile fired by north 
Yemeni forces slammed into Aden, the capital of southern Yemen, 
early Wednesday, triggering a huge fire near the airport, 
correspondents reported. 
  South Yemeni anti-aircraft units had earlier opened fire in 
an attempt to intercept the missile. 
  Ambulances and fire engines rushed to the scene but there 
were no immediate reports of causalities. 
  Yemen erupted into open civil war between northern and 
southern forces on May 5 as their political leaders had failed 
to agree on governing the country.

  [Excerpt] During the session it held this morning under 
Speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, the House of 
Representatives heard the letter addressed to it from Acting 
Prime Minister Dr. Muhammad Sa'id al-'Attar. 
  The letter reads: Brother Esteemed Speaker of the House of 
Representatives, Esteemed Members of the House of 
Representatives. May God's peace and blessing be upon you. The 
House of Representatives had earlier approved the declaration of 
the state of emergency in accordance with Republican Decree No. 
20 of 1994, which was necessitated by the internal sedition 
which was the result of the rebellion of secessionist elements 
in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leadership against the 
constitutional legitimacy, and the ensuing military actions and 
direct threat to the citizens' security and stability. Since 
the political leadership was concerned to make the period of the 
state of emergency very limited in harmony with the democratic 
policy of our country, the period was set for 30 days. However, 
the circumstances which necessitated the declaration of the 
state of emergency have not been finally settled. This calls 
for extending the state of emergency for another similar period. 
Based on Article 97 of the Constitution on the need to obtain 
the House of Representatives' approval for extending the state 
of emergency, we hope that the House will extend it for another 
30 days as of the end of the previous period, taking into 
consideration that the National Defense Council, which is 
entrusted with assessing the state of emergency, has approved 
such extension. In light of this, we present this request to 
your esteemed house. Please accept our greetings and 
appreciation. 
  The Parliament has agreed to extend the state of emergency 
for another 30 days in accordance with the public interest.

  [Excerpt] New York, 1 Jun (INA) -- Yemen has officially 
accused the Gulf states, led by Saudi Arabia, of interfering in 
the internal affairs of the Republic of Yemen. 
  This is contained in an official message addressed to the 
Security Council by Yemeni UN Ambassador 'Abdallah al-Ashtal. 
  In the message, Yemen said it considers the call for 
convening a Security Council meeting to be interference in its 
internal affairs, which conflicts with Paragraph 7 of Article 2 
of the UN Charter that says nothing in the charter justifies UN 
interference in affairs that are purely part of the sovereignty 
of any country, and that nothing in the charter stipulates that 
member states can call for a discussion of such issues.

  [Excerpts] House of Representatives Speaker Shaykh 
'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar has sent a message to 'Amr Musa, 
chairman of the current session of the nonaligned foreign 
ministers' conference, in which he expressed, on his behalf and 
on behalf of the members of the House of Representatives, wishes 
of success for the conference. Attached to the message was a 
message from the House of Representatives addressed to the 
chairman of the session, its rapporteur, and members of the 
conference. 
  The message includes the House's appreciation for the 
aforementioned parties' concern for safeguarding the 
sovereignty, freedom, and independence of the member states of 
the Nonaligned Movement. 
  The House of Representatives' message also includes 
clarification of some facts related to the Yemeni issue. Among 
these are facts related to the deep roots of the Yemeni unity in 
the history and culture of our people, the Yemeni people's 
blessing of the reestablishment of the Yemeni unity on 22 May 
1990, and the achievement of national consensus of unity during 
the conduction of the general referendum on the constitution of 
the unity state in 1991. The message notes that international 
democratic organizations supervised this referendum. 
  Within the context of reviewing these facts, the message 
refers to the elections of 27 April 1993 which were held in 
Yemen as the first unified parliamentary elections, during which 
more than 22 parties competed, in addition to the independents. 
The entire world applauded these honest elections which were 
held on free, democratic bases. All the parties and 
organizations, including the [Yemeni] Socialist Party, accepted 
their results. [passage omitted] 
  In its message, the House of Representatives emphasized the 
national constants, chief of which is adherence to unity as the 
fate and destiny of the Yemeni people. The message says that 
unity is irrevocable and that there will be no compromise on it. 
  The House of Representatives appealed to the nonaligned 
foreign ministers' conference to deal with what is taking place 
in our country as an internal affair, and to pressure the 
nonaligned member states which seek to gain a foothold in what 
is taking place in Yemen, not to interfere in our country's 
internal affairs, especially since this will escalate the 
situation and prolong and expand the war. 
  The House of Representatives asked the conference not to 
deal 
with any requests to recognize the claims of the secessionists 
and rebels because this will be against the Yemeni people's 
will, interference in their internal affairs, and a contribution 
to escalating the conflict in the country.

  [Text] The House of Representatives has sent a letter to 
UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali and the president 
and members of the UN Security Council. 
  The letter expressed the House of Representatives' 
appreciation for the Security Council's positions and its 
concern about the protection of the independence and sovereignty 
of nations. It also expressed the hope that these stands will 
be further bolstered when the Security Council reviews the 
internal Yemeni developments that have to do with the essence of 
preserving its sovereignty, security, and independence in line 
with the Constitution and the laws in force. 
  In its letter, the House of Representatives found it strange 
that the Security Council should address our internal issue by 
depending on wrong information and outside mediators, despite 
the fact that our country, an active UN member, has not filed a 
request with the council in this regard. 
  The letter of the House of Representatives explained that 
Yemen -- land and man -- has experienced eternal unity in its 
history and culture. There are no ethnic or religious 
minorities in Yemen. Yemeni unity, achieved on 22 May 1990 and 
hailed by the Arabs and the world, is the unity of two political 
regimes, not two different peoples. The unity was achieved by 
peaceful and democratic means. The agreement on the proclamation 
of the Yemeni Republic and the Constitution of the unity states 
was signed by the two presidents of the two former regimes and 
endorsed by the two houses of parliaments in the former two 
parts. 
  The letter notes that the first national consensus on unity 
was achieved when a public referendum was held on the 
Constitution of the unity state in 1990. International 
organizations attested to the integrity of this referendum. In 
the first unified parliamentary elections on 27 April 1993, more 
than 22 political parties and organizations, as well as 
independents, took part. The entire world attested to the 
integrity of the elections. All international organizations and 
commissions that care about human rights, primarily the United 
Nations and the five Security Council permanent member states, 
blessed these elections. Also, all political parties, including 
the Socialist Party, recognized the results of the elections. 
After the elections, Yemen moved from the legitimacy of merger 
through political agreement to the legitimacy of unity through 
the constitutional and legitimate institutions. Thus, regional 
representation was canceled when the first unified House of 
Representatives convened on 12 May 1993, in accordance with the 
Constitution that stipulates that the members of the House of 
Representatives represent the entire people and look after 
public interests, and not individuals. 
  The letter of the House of Representatives to the UN 
secretary general and the president and members of the UN 
Security Council added: Following the elections, the Republic 
of Yemen entered a new experiment in government. A coalition 
government was formed, including the three major political 
parties: The General People's Congress, the Yemeni Reform 
Grouping, and the Socialist Party. This coalition adopted a 
document that was called the Document of Government Coalition. 
It asserted an adherence to national principles, including the 
preservation of unity as a question of sovereignty that is not 
to be infringed upon. The unity state adhered to democratic 
practice in accordance with political pluralism and freedom of 
expression. In this state, different views and programs were 
aired in the service of society in line with modern foundations, 
based on total respect for human rights. 
  In its letter, the House of Representatives further 
explained 
the constitutional status of the formation of the unity state 
and its institutions. It then reviewed attempts to circumvent 
constitutional legitimacy and democracy in the country and 
undermine the unity state by a rebellious gang that defied law 
and order and chose violence by exploding the military situation 
to implement its scheme that aims at fragmenting unity and 
undermining the nation's determination. 
  The letter noted that when this gang found that the outcome 
of the 27 April elections was not in its favor and did not 
advance its fortunes to occupy top posts in power, they started 
to contemplate a coup against constitutional legitimacy by 
creating crises and triggering explosions and assassinations and 
disrupting security. Then, they caused the political and 
economic situation to become tense and confused democracy by 
setting new conditions and demands with the aim of canceling 
constitutional legitimacy. The leader of the rebels, 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid, refused to submit to the Constitution and the laws and 
regulations of the country as a vice chairman of the unity 
state, so he did not complete the constitutional measures. This 
is in addition to hindering the work of the state institutions 
through their participation in power by staying in Aden, the 
commercial and economic capital, and their sabotage of these 
institutions. 
  Despite all of the above, the legitimate authority of the 
country adhered to dialogue, with the participation of national 
forces and political parties and organizations. As a result of 
this dialogue, an accord document was signed in Amman. However, 
no sooner had the document been signed than the rebels exploded 
the military situation in Abyan. 
  The chapters of the conspiracy reached the peak on 21 May 
1994 when al-Bid declared secession in a serious, illegitimate 
precedent. Al-Bid wanted to form a state from a homeland that 
has a unified origin, culture, creed, history, and language. 
  The letter added that the House deems this declaration null 
and illegitimate, based on Article 1 of the Constitution of the 
Yemeni Republic. Based on this Article, the House of 
Representatives deems any recognition of this secessionist 
declaration by any side, state, or organization as an attack on 
the Yemeni people's right of national unionist belonging. 
  In its letter, the House of Representatives also asked the 
UN 
secretary general and the president and members of the Security 
Council to deal with what is happening in our country as an 
internal affair in line with Article 2, Paragraph 7 of the UN 
Charter and to reject any request to discuss the Yemeni issue 
unless it is filed by the Government of the Yemeni Republic. 
The letter also asked the UN secretary general and the 
president and members of the Security Council to pressure the 
member states of the United Nations and the Security Council 
which seek to have a foothold regarding what is happening in 
Yemen so as not to interfere in our country's internal affairs 
because this would further complicate the situation and prolong 
the war.

  [Text] At the Foreign Ministry's conferences room today, 
brother Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, minister of planning and 
development, met with the heads of brotherly and friendly 
diplomatic missions in Sanaa. During the meeting, Dr. al-Iryani 
spoke about the situation in our country and its developments. 
He said: We are eager to meet with members of the diplomatic 
corps in Sanaa to brief them on the Republic of Yemen's stand 
toward previous cease-fire appeals and the subsequent move at 
the UN Security Council. I believe that parties to any war 
anywhere in the world appeal for cease-fires. There is nothing 
strange in that. What is peculiar in Yemen's case is that such 
cease-fire appeals do not offer an adequate solution to the 
other party. In other words, everyone says: Stop fighting, but 
they do not give any guarantees to prevent the resumption of 
fighting. The farthest such appeals could go was to say: Stop 
fighting and resume dialogue. Our colleagues in the diplomatic 
corps in Sanaa are familiar with the nine-month crisis. During 
that period, we did not stop dialogue. Yet, appeals say: Stop 
fighting and resume dialogue. If any guarantees are made at 
all, what about the aftermath of the cease-fire? 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani said: You all remember that a 
few days after the beginning of clashes, an Arab League 
delegation came and met with the brother chairman. The brother 
chairman told them: If you obtain guarantees from the other side 
that they will not harm unity, legitimacy, and the unity of the 
Armed Forces, we will halt fighting. When it left Sanaa, the 
delegation was supposed to hold contacts with the other side to 
secure those guarantees. However, no sooner had the delegation 
arrived in Cairo than the mass media began to say that Sanaa 
rejected a cease-fire. Moreover, the Arab League delegation 
that visited Sanaa has so far said nothing about what the other 
side said about the required guarantees for cease-fire or for 
halting fighting in such a manner that maintains unity and 
constitutional legitimacy, or whether they have made any 
guarantees for ensuring the results of the April elections. 
Those were the conditions that were conveyed to the Arab League. 
  Dr. al-Iryani said: During my recent visit to Saudi Arabia, 
I met with the custodian of the two holy mosques. We requested 
good offices within the framework of the same conditions that 
were conveyed to whoever appealed for a cease-fire. At the end 
of our discussions, I felt that there was readiness to exert all 
possible efforts. The custodian of the two holy mosques 
proposed a temporary cease-fire on the occasion of the blessed 
'Id al-Adha. I carried the proposal to Sanaa. After elaborate 
discussions, a three-day cease-fire on the occasion of 'Id 
al-Adha was approved. That was the most visible evidence that 
when Sanaa is asked to cease fire for a logical reason, this 
only leads to a bigger problem than the fighting itself. Sanaa 
responded to that request. 
  Addressing the heads of diplomatic corps, brother Dr. 
'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani continued: You all are aware that 
days--or rather hours--after that, al-Bid declared secession. 
He foiled that attempt, which could have served as a 72-hour 
chance for good offices to secure the guarantees that we had 
demanded and to make sure that the cease-fire would hold. 
Therefore, the first to abort any serious cease-fire attempt 
were the secessionists, for they do not want to cease fire. 
  The brother minister of planning and development added: 
What is new about this crisis is that it has become of topic of 
interest to amateurs in international law. Some say: No unity 
is imposed by force. I ask: How was the Yemeni unity achieved? 
Did it take place four years ago through mutual consent or by 
force? Two days ago, al-Bid acknowledged that the unity took 
place through mutual consent. Now it is said that we are going 
to impose unity by force. Such are the views of international 
law amateurs. I remind you that we fought in 1972 to impose 
unity by force. Then, it was the right of every state to object 
to imposing unity by force. In 1973, the north wanted to impose 
unity on the south. In the 1979 war, it was the opposite; the 
south wanted to impose unity by force on the north. Then, every 
state had the right to oppose imposing unity by force. But 
unity now has been achieved and approved by the Yemeni people. 
The Constitution of the new state has been approved through a 
referendum. Legislative elections were held and the world 
testified to their fairness. Yet, we are asked not to impose 
unity by force. By all standards, this calls for amazement. To 
say that Sanaa wants to impose unity by force calls for 
amazement. The demand for new unity formulas is a foreign 
rather than a Yemeni demand. The secessionists themselves have 
declared secession. So, why the talk about a new unity formula? 
They demand a new unity formula, while the secessionists have 
already declared secession. 
  He added: Suddenly, the Security Council moved. I would 
like to affirm that the republic respects international 
organizations and their charters and abides by all legitimate 
resolutions. I believe that even at the peak of crises, we did 
not hesitate to comply with pertinent resolutions although we 
had reservations about them. I said that we had asked the Arab 
League to provide guarantees to us complying with legitimacy, 
the existence of the Republic of Yemen, international law, and 
rules pursued in any unified state in the world. However, the 
Arab League disappeared completely. We heard nothing from them, 
until the issue appeared at the Security Council. Our objection 
to raising this issue at the Security Council proceeds from the 
Paragraph Seven of Article Two of the UN Charter, which says 
that nothing in this charter justifies UN intervention in any 
state's domestic affairs. The UN Security Council's move, as we 
heard, proceeds from Article 34, which says: The Security 
Council is entitled to identify any conflict or any position 
which might lead to international altercation or dispute. This 
is in order to decide whether the continuation of this dispute 
or position may jeopardize international peace and security. 
Thus, the Security Council has the right to identify, but not 
to debate and decide. It must determine whether what is going 
on in Yemen is a source of threat to international peace and 
security. However, we are amazed to hear that what is being 
proposed is a draft resolution regarding which even Yemen has 
not been consulted or advised.

  [Excerpts] At the Foreign Ministry's meetings hall today, 
brother Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, minister of planning and 
development, met with the heads of the diplomatic missions in 
Sanaa. [passage omitted] 
  Dr. al-Iryani added: Yemen's position on this issue is that 
it regards what is taking place in Yemen as an internal affair 
and that the Security Council is not entitled [to discuss this]. 
At the same time, since the move began at the Security Council, 
we have not said that we categorically reject any resolution 
issued. We cannot say in advance that we will accept any 
resolution issued. We adhere to this opinion, and we do not 
want to have differences with this international institution. 
However, it is our right to [word indistinct] and to have 
doubts about the reasons behind raising this issue. We have the 
right to say that this is the beginning. No one, however, knows 
what is the end of this new discussion of an internal Yemeni 
problem. 
  Al-Iryani continued: Thus, the Yemeni leadership decided to 
send a Presidential Council member and the justice minister to 
the United Nations to explain Yemen's viewpoint on this internal 
affair and to stress that the Republic was established on 
genuine bases according to the international law, that both the 
declaration of the Republic and even its timing were made in 
consultation with the United Nations, and that the foreign 
ministers of the two formerly independent states which merged 
into one state, the Republic of Yemen, signed all [word 
indistinct] statements at the United Nations and for the members 
of the diplomatic corps. [words indistinct] we signed all 
statements and decisions and [words indistinct] unity on the 
ground, so he later said: [passage indistinct] once again 
asserts its [word indistinct] and commitment to the 
international charters and the UN Charter by legitimate 
decisions. We cannot at all have difference with the Security 
Council. However, we have the right to express our viewpoint 
and not to accept interference in our internal affairs. I 
reiterate this [words indistinct] and that we have the right to 
say that interference in our internal affairs is not permitted 
according to the UN Charter. 
  Brother al-Iryani added: As for the principle of a 
cease-fire, I assert that we appreciate and respect everyone who 
demands stopping any war anywhere in the world. However, [word 
indistinct] any war has conditions and [word indistinct]. The 
reasons for this war and the intentions of the rebellious side 
should be known. It is clear that the intention of the rebels 
was secession. Did [words indistinct] the secessionists to 
cease fire know in advance that [word indistinct] want secession 
and at the same time they demanded a halt to fighting? We leave 
this question for the (?future).

  [Text] Cairo, 29 May (MENA) -- Yemeni Foreign Minister 
Muhammad Salih Basindwah has said that Sanaa does not reject a 
cease-fire, but does not accept one based on the imposition of 
secession. Secession is impossible, he said. 
  In statements following his meeting with Arab League 
Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majd today, Basindwah said 
that as a condition for ending the fighting between Sanaa and 
Aden, legitimacy and the Constitution must be the standards. He 
stressed that all Yemenis defend unity and reject separation. 
  On 'Ali Salim al-Bid's request that south Yemen's Arab 
League 
membership be restored, Basindwah said the Arab League secretary 
general stressed to him that the request has no standing. 
  The Yemeni foreign minister denied that Iraqi or Sudanese 
forces are fighting alongside the Yemeni forces in the north. 
He said the southern allegations in this respect are false. 
Sanaa does not need fighters; it is Aden that needs additional 
forces, he said. 
  Basindwah said he informed Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid of the latest 
developments in Yemen. 
  He said events in Yemen prove that the "secessionists" 
cannot 
establish "their alleged state". 
  He said the head of the alleged state has fled to 
Hadhramaut, 
and will flee abroad from there. 
  He accused the southerners of providing shelter to world 
terrorist leaders, notably Marcos [name as received] and 
Abu-Nidal [Sabri al-Banna]. 
  Asked what Sanaa's position will be if the UN Security 
Council passes a resolution on the Yemeni crisis, Basindwah 
said: We oppose any interference in the crisis by the Security 
Council because this is an internal affair. 
  If the Security Council issues a resolution, he said, then 
we 
will react according to the situation.

  [Text] Brother 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani, member of the 
Presidential Council, has met with representatives of notables 
and dignitaries of the al-Hadah Subdistrict in Yafi' District 
[in southern Yemen], who came to Sanaa to stress their support 
for constitutional legitimacy and readiness to confront all 
secessionist attempts, as well as their belief in Yemeni unity 
as the destiny of our people. 
  The dignitaries expressed their absolute rejection of 
al-Bid's secessionist declaration, noting they had suffered for 
27 years from the domination of the Socialist Party and that it 
was time to be free from this despotism. 
  The brother member of the Presidential Council thanked them 
for this attitude, stressing the importance of vigilance and 
decisive opposition of all the secessionist who have threatened 
unity, spilled blood, attacked property, refused to submit to 
the people's will to let them choose their own rulers, and did 
not acknowledge the peaceful transfer of power. 
  Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani also noted the great 
victories scored by our valiant army on all axes of the 
fighting. He called for a unified rank, mobilizing all popular 
and official capabilities, to support the Armed Forces and ease 
the effects of striking residential areas in Sanaa and other 
governorates by the gang of apostasy and secession.

<F P=106> [Interview with Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, "former </F>
Yemeni prime minister and current prime minister of the 
government declared by 'Ali Salim al-Bid in Aden," by Sawsan 
Abu-Husayn in Cairo on 26 May] 
  [Text] [Abu-Husayn] What are the most important results 
of your visit to Cairo? 
  [Al-'Attas] During my meeting with President Husni Mubarak, 
I sensed full understanding, particularly in connection with 
ending the fighting, reviving the dialogue, and concern for the 
interests and rights of the Yemeni people. I sensed the same 
thing during my meeting with [Arab League Secretary General] Dr. 
'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid who understands the minute details of the 
Yemeni crisis and the attempts to resolve it. 
  [Abu-Husayn] Why did you apply for Democratic Yemen's 
membership of the Arab League? 
  [Al-'Attas] We have asked Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid to rectify the 
situation and restore it to what it was before, that is South 
Yemen as it was before May 22 1990. We are a state already in 
existence and we do not require fresh recognition but that state 
should be treated the same way it was treated in the past, as an 
independent state. Unity, from the day it was declared to just 
a few days before the infighting started, was not achieved in 
real terms. Now we are trying to regain our positions. 
Numerous crises similar to the Yemeni crisis have been settled 
along the same lines we are following now but we need Arab 
supporting efforts before any Western positions are taken. 
  [Abu-Husayn] As it is the intention of the south to secede 
and return to the pre-22 May 1990 situation, on what basis would 
dialogue be restored between you and the north? 
  [Al-'Attas] As a dialogue between two presidents, 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid and 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, to discuss the problems 
resulting from the war, Yemeni-Yemeni relations, mutual 
recognition, and Arab-Yemeni relations. 
  [Abu-Husayn] How do you view the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's 
call on the Security Council to discuss the Yemeni crisis? 
  [Al-'Attas] Our view is that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is 
our neighbor and is affected by what takes place in Yemen, a 
matter which prompts it to take every possible stand to bring an 
end to the current fighting. We welcome and support that call, 
and we are fully confident that it will produce positive 
results. If the Security Council passes a cease-fire 
resolution, then both sides must comply. In the event of a 
violation by either side, there is Article 7 of the charter 
which could mean sanctions or direct intervention. 
  [Abu-Husayn] What if Western and Arab states refuse to 
recognize Democratic Yemen and reaffirm the importance of unity 
between the two parts? 
  [Al-'Attas] I say again, we do not need new recognition. We 
are trying to regain our place at the Security Council, the Arab 
League, the Islamic Conference Organization, and all 
international bodies. What is this unity that the north is now 
claiming and talking about? The north was the side which 
declared the secession and is emphasizing in practice that it 
wants annexation of the south to the north, not on a basis of 
unity. 
  Furthermore, since the war began, the northern leadership 
has 
taken several secessionist measures, including dismissal of 
southern ambassadors and ministers, and it incited the 
fundamentalists to kill them. I personally was the target of 
many attempts. All this forced us to take the step of declaring 
the [southern] republic particularly as there was no full merger 
into a unitary state, and there were political practices 
combining the state with the tribes, a matter not stipulated in 
the Pledge and Accord Document and something which the northern 
leadership insisted on doing.

  [Text] Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri, the deputy chairman of 
the Presidential Council, has issued a statement to the YEMENI 
NEWS AGENCY, Aden, on the military offensive being mounted by 
the forces of the rulers in Sanaa against the sovereignty of our 
country, the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY]. He said in the 
statement: We had been expecting such an offensive, which 
reveals the despair of the rulers of Sanaa, in that they are 
making an attempt to draw the attention of the world to battles 
and destruction, instead of to peace. The brother deputy 
chairman of the Presidential Council expressed confidence that 
this barbarous offensive against peaceful villages must fail and 
collapse, noting that the rulers of Sanaa would fail to realize 
their aims. Brother al-Jifri noted that the attackers had 
mounted a broad offensive on all fronts, using in their vanguard 
the good sons of Yemen, whom they have misled. He said: We 
were expecting this attack -- our forces had been waiting for it 
and are heroically repulsing it, inflicting great losses of life 
and material on the enemy. The brother deputy chairman of the 
Presidential Council reassured the sons of our people that the 
enemy had not, and would not, achieve the aims of his attack. 
Our forces, with their air, naval, and ground arms, are capable 
of protecting the territory and sovereignty of the Democratic 
Republic of Yemen. 
  The brother deputy chairman of the Presidential Council said 
that, during the past two days, a number of false claims had 
been put about, to the effect that Aden airport had been shelled 
and destroyed by artillery. The sons of our people all know 
that this is just an empty claim. He said he thought that the 
allegations would persist for another couple of days or longer, 
but that victory is our ally and God is on our side, because we 
are the victims of aggression.

  [Text] His Royal Highness Crown Prince has said that Arabs 
were cautiously optimistic about peace with Israel. 
  This came in a speech before an annual meeting of the UN 
agency caring for Palestinian refugees, read on behalf of his 
royal highness by Minister of State Mr. 'Adil 'Irshayd. 
  The crown prince said the continued frustrations Arab people 
have lived over the past two years are regressing now, and are 
being replaced by cautious optimism that the peace process will 
continue its march until it reaches a comprehensive solution. 
  But Prince Hasan added that the feelings of fear and anxiety 
are still there, referring to unresolved Arab-Israeli issues and 
agreements signed but never implemented. 
  Prince Hasan said the UN Relief and Works Agency should 
continue health and education services until the plight of 3 
million refugees were settled in a fair and permanent way that 
secures their rights in line with UN resolutions.

  [Text] Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz arrived in 
Amman yesterday evening to take part in the 17th ministerial 
session of the ESCWA [Economic and Social Commission for Western 
Asia], which opened its meetings in Amman yesterday. 
  Upon arrival, the Lebanese minister expressed happiness over 
his visit to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. He said the 
Lebanese people cherish and appreciate the Jordanian people and 
that His Majesty King Husayn occupies a special place in the 
hearts of all the Lebanese. 
  He added that during his visit he will take part in the 
ESCWA's ministerial session, especially since Lebanon is one of 
the countries nominated to serve as the headquarters for this 
commission. 
  On the peace process, the Lebanese minister said that after 
more than three years since the launching of the peace process 
and the Madrid conference, this process has not achieved the 
hopes that had been pinned on it. He asserted that the two 
cosponsors of the Madrid conference should continue to play an 
active role in line with the requirements of the Madrid process 
through the resolutions of international legitimacy and to play 
the role of a fair broker. 
  The Lebanese minister noted that he will meet with several 
Jordanian officials to discuss Arab developments of interest to 
both countries.

  [Text] Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali received 
at his office in the Prime Ministry today Lebanese Foreign 
Minister Faris Buwayz, who is participating in the 17th session 
of the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, ESCWA, 
which is currently convening in Amman. The talks dealt with 
ways to strengthen bilateral relations in all fields, 
particularly in the economic, trade, and customs fields. They 
also reviewed the latest developments in the peace process. 
  In a statement to PETRA after the meeting, Buwayz said he 
felt full readiness on the part of the prime minister to reach a 
new concept for Jordanian-Lebanese relations with the aim of 
developing cooperation and coordination between the two sisterly 
countries. He said: We, in Lebanon, greatly appreciate the 
fraternal Jordanian people. We have great interests with Jordan 
that need to be organized for the benefit of both countries and 
people. He stressed that the coming stage requires further 
coordination and cohesion toward the various issues. 
  Regarding the current Lebanese stand vis-a-vis the peace 
process, Buwayz said: Now that approximately three and a half 
years have passed since the Madrid conference, we cannot say 
that these talks have reached the sought level or achieved the 
sought results. We cannot also say that the Israeli side deals 
with these talks in the required way. New problems and 
challenges surfaced during this period. 
  Buwayz said: Despite all circumstances, we believe that this 
peace should be given a chance. We also believe that the 
Israeli side should prove it is still committed to the 
principles of peace in terms of its fairness and the 
implementation of the international resolutions and the 
principle of land for peace. 
  Regarding the most prominent developments in the trial of 
those accused of involvement in the assassination of Jordanian 
diplomat, martyr Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah, which began recently, the 
Lebanese foreign minister said: It is known that the competent 
Lebanese departments arrested the suspects moments after the 
crime was committed. We can say that Lebanese judiciary, which 
is known for its fairness and independence, will deal with this 
subject with all seriousness and it has issued the indictment. 
We have no doubt that the court will issue a fair decision. 
  The meeting was attended by Dr. Fawwaz Abu-al-Ghanam, 
minister of state and acting minister of state for foreign 
affairs, and the Lebanese ambassador in Amman.

  [Text] Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali conferred 
with Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz who is in Amman 
attending the annual meeting of the UN Economic and Social 
Commission for Western Asia, ESCWA. Dr. al-Majali and Mr. 
Buwayz discussed ways of bolstering relations between the two 
countries, particularly in the fields of economy and trade. 
They also reviewed latest developments in the Middle East peace 
process. The Lebanese minister said later that Middle East 
peace should be given a chance even if nearly three years of 
Arab-Israeli talks have failed to achieve much for his country. 
He said the Israeli side had to prove it is still committed to 
the principles of peace and to implementing international 
resolutions, including the principle of land for peace. 
  Buwayz told the News at Ten that Jordanian-Lebanese ties 
were 
good and commended Jordan's position toward the peace process as 
highly credible. 
  [Begin recording] [Buwayz] If we have to describe our 
relations, I will say that we have some very good relations, 
which need to be maybe better organized at the technical, at the 
commercial, at the economical level. And, I hope, we talked 
about the possibility of naming a high commission, which will 
study all the problems concerning this field. 
  [Correspondent Maha al-Sha'ir] With respect to the peace 
process, how do you view coordination with Jordan, and where is 
Lebanon now? 
  [Buwayz] I think that Jordan, the Jordanian Government, 
proved a high level of credibility in the unified Arab position 
till now. We think that this peace can be only a global peace, 
real peace, and this ask from ourselves unified position 
concerning the whole problems of the area. We think that any 
party, which will try to go very fast, will have to wait for the 
others because at the end this peace cannot be between Israel 
and only one party. And nobody in the Arab world can by itself 
only cover this peace decision. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Ayman al-Safadi] </F>
  [Text] Amman -- A senior government official Monday [30 
May] reasserted Jordan's neutrality on the civil war in Yemen, 
saying the Kingdom only supports the unity of the Yemeni people 
and the quest for a peaceful settlement to the conflict. 
  "We are with legitimacy in Yemen, with the unity of its land 
and with respecting the reconciliation accord" which was signed 
in Amman in February by Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
and his then-Vice-President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, Information 
Minister Jawad al-'Anani told the Jordan Times Monday. 
  Dr. al-'Anani said the Kingdom has not taken sides with 
either of the parties to the conflict, which developed into 
civil war on May 4. He said the official media's reference to 
the government in Aden as "the legitimate government" and to the 
forces of Mr. al-Bid as the "secessionists" does not mean that 
the Kingdom has sided with Sanaa against Aden. 
  "Jordan supports the unity of Yemen," he said. It did not 
therefore refer to the warring parties as north and south 
because that "would mean you have accepted the secession," Dr. 
al-'Anani said. 
  "We will not take a stand against legitimacy and say north 
and south," he said. 
  The position of the official media is right. They are 
calling things by their name because those who declared 
secession are secessionists," former foreign minister, Deputy 
Abdallah al-Nusur told the Jordan Times. 
  Insisting that this position does not mean the Kingdom has 
taken sides with either of the conflicting parties in yemen, Dr. 
al-Nusur said "Jordan has a record of not interfering in the 
internal affairs of any other country." 
  Though blaming the south for seceding, Islamic Action Front 
(IAF) deputy 'Abd al-Rahim 'Ukur said: "We did not hear any 
Jordanian official saying the Kingdom has taken sides in the 
conflict." 
  Dr. 'Ukur blamed Arab regimes that he said have supported 
one 
party in Yemen against the other, adding that "these attitudes 
only serve the objectives of the United States and its satellite 
states in the region. 
  Jordan supports the unity of the Yemeni people and land but 
does not work to impose anything on them, Lower House of 
Parliament member Salih Irshaydat said. 
  If this support of unity was interpreted to mean that the 
Kingdom has taken sides in the conflict then that is a wrong 
interpretation, he said. 
  "We are with unity as long as it is the wish of the Yemeni 
people," Dr. Irshaydat said. 
  His Majesty King Husayn had earlier said that the Kingdom 
will provide humanitarian assistance to Yemen but will not 
interfere in the internal affairs of the war-torn Arab peninsula 
country. 
  North Yemen has previously rejected any foreign intervention 
in the civil war, which has been raging for over three weeks 
without leading to a decisive military victory. 
  Prime Minister 'Abd al-Salam al-Majali had said that Jordan 
would not mediate in the conflict unless both parties to it 
agree on its role, adding that the Kingdom would not "interfere 
in support of either parties to the crisis." 
  AKHIR KHABAR Arab daily Monday reported that a group of 
journalists it did not name have protested to Dr. al-'Anani what 
it called "the biased coverage of the Yemeni war by the official 
media." 
  The paper quoted the group as telling the minisiter in a 
statement that such an attitude would not allow Jordan to play 
any positive role in trying to mediate the conflict in the 
future.

  [Text] Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali 
emphasized Jordan's firm position on the current situation in 
the Republic of Yemen and its support for the legitimacy and 
unity that was realized through agreement among all parties in 
the sisterly country. 
  At his meeting with 'Abd al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, Yemeni 
Presidential Council member, at his office in the Prime Ministry 
this morning, the prime minister also emphasized the 
noninterference of Jordan in the Yemeni internal affairs, and 
Jordan's support for a cease-fire and a halt to fighting. 
  For his part, 'Abd-al-Ghani said in a statement to reporters 
that the meeting reviewed bilateral relations, the latest 
developments in the situation in the Republic of Yemen, and the 
visit he will make to the United States to attend the Security 
Council deliberations on the Yemeni crisis--a meeting called by 
certain countries. 
  He added: We are always ready for dialogue and diplomatic 
efforts to resolve the Yemeni crisis, and we are always ready to 
end fighting if the elements that created the situation return 
to constitutional legitimacy and retract the statement which 
sought--through armed rebellion--to separate parts of the 
Republic of Yemen formed on 22 May 1990, and blessed by all 
Yemeni people. 
  He added: We believe that discussing the issue at 
international forums is interference in Yemeni affairs because 
what is taking place in the Yemeni arena is a purely internal 
Yemeni affair. He said: What is taking place is a rebellion 
carried out by some elements of the Socialist Party that forced 
the constitutional legitimacy to confront it in order to realize 
security and stability in the Republic of Yemen. 
  Concerning the alternatives that may be proposed during the 
Security Council deliberations on this crisis, 'Abd-al-Ghani 
said the solution lies in resolving the issue in accordance with 
the constitutional legitimacy that resulted from the elections 
of March 1993, and--according to testimony of the whole 
world--were honest, and in which all eligible voters 
participated. 
  He added: We ask all brothers and friends to deal with the 
Republic of Yemen in accordance with the principles of 
international law which respect the sovereignty of every 
country, and state that no country should interfere in the 
affairs of another. 
  He emphasized that Yemeni unity is an accomplished fact 
supported by all Yemenis, and added that no one can return Yemen 
to the situation that prevailed before 22 May 1990. 
  He also stressed that the danger posed by presenting the 
Yemeni issue [at the Security Council] is the interference in an 
internal Yemeni affair. It is a serious step to discuss a 
subject that concerns a sovereign state and member of all 
regional organizations and the United Nations and one which is 
committed to the UN Charter and regional and international 
charters. 
  He added: We think that discussing any internal issue in any 
country is a dangerous precedent because doing so is not 
stipulated in the UN Charter, especially Article 2 of this 
charter. 
  The meeting was attended by Fawwaz Abu-al-Ghanam, acting 
minister of state for foreign affairs, and the Yemeni ambassador 
in Amman. 
  'Abd-al-Ghani left Amman for New York today. He was seen off 
by the acting minister of state for foreign affairs and the 
Yemeni ambassador in Amman.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Yemeni People's Will Is the Basis] </F>
  [Text] Since it was decided that the Security Council was 
to be convened to discuss the crisis in sisterly Yemen, even 
though this crisis is an internal issue which the legitimate 
authority did not ask to have discussed, all countries taking 
part in the meetings of this international body should respect 
the Yemeni people's unity, territorial integrity, and legitimacy 
in Yemen. Otherwise, foreign interference in Yemeni 
affairs--against the will of its people and government--will 
complicate the crisis and make it impossible to be resolved. 
  Sanaa has accepted a cease-fire on the condition that the 
declaration of secession by Aden be abrogated and the unity of 
the Yemeni people be preserved. This is an objective, 
courageous, and responsible position on the part of Sanaa, and 
one that all Arab countries and international organizations, 
including the Security Council, should support. 
  If the interference by some Arab and foreign countries seeks 
to internationalize the Yemeni crisis in order to encourage and 
entrench the secession of the south, this is something that 
conflicts completely with Arab League and UN Charters, and at 
the same time conflicts and ignores the will of the Yemeni 
people. 
  Halting this destructive war and resorting to fraternal and 
constructive dialogue between the north and the south, rather 
than the exchange of destructive missiles and shells, is a 
national, pan-Arab, and humanitarian demand that both sides 
should accept on the basis of emphasizing legitimacy and 
national unity, not entrenching secession. 
  The Security Council is currently facing a difficult test, 
and we hope that it will adopt just resolutions which respect 
the legitimacy and unity of the Yemeni people and their 
territorial integrity, and not encourage the separatist tendency 
of a handful of secessionists who deviate from the brotherly 
Yemeni people's will in the north and the south. 
  We would like to remind the Security Council that UN 
involvement in resolutions of the crises in Somalia, former 
Yugoslavia, and other past and current crises did not solve 
these crises but aggravated them in a more dangerous manner than 
they had been the case before internationalization. 
  We also want remind Arab brothers in all Arab countries that 
unity was the choice of the Yemeni people and the consensus of 
the leaders and masses in the north and south, and this official 
and popular choice should not be snubbed.

  [Text] Amman (Petra)--The segregation of sexes at swimming 
pools and sports clubs came under scrutiny by the Lower House of 
Parliament Sunday as deputies discussed the amended youth 
welfare law, which was turned back to the House by the Upper 
House of Parliament (the Senate) after several amendments were 
introduced to it. 
  The House supported the stand of its judicial committee, 
which insisted on preserving amendments introduced by the Lower 
House to the Law. 
  A heated debate took place at the meeting over Clause C of 
the law's Article 2, which was added by the Lower House, 
stipulating that the Ministry of Youth shall segregate sexes at 
swimming pools. The clause was deleted by the Upper House. 
  The House's Judiciary Committee insisted on maintaining the 
clause in the law, saying sexual segregation in public swimming 
pools "conforms with our Islamic values and the deeply-rooted 
morals of our society." 
  With some deputies saying it was difficult to segregate the 
sexes in private swimming pools or on the al-'Aqabah and the 
Dead Sea beaches, others called for specifying which pools would 
fall under the provisions of the law. They said that it was 
possible to apply the article to the ministry's swimming pools, 
while it was difficult to apply it to those of hotels, touristic 
facilities and the al-'Aqabah and the Dead Sea beaches. 
  They said the law should not include swimming pools at 
touristic areas since this might affect the tourism industry. 
  The House then approved the amended 1994 Civil Courts Law 
after its Judiciary Committee introduced several amendments to 
it. It commenced its debate of the amended Municipalities law, 
which was sent back to it by the Senate, which introduced 
several amendments to it. The House approved some of these 
amendments but insisted on preserving others as they were passed 
by it.

expressed its deep regret for the unacceptable provocative 
measures that the Sudanese Government has recently adopted 
against Egyptian property and nationals in Sudan. 
  In a statement it has issued, the committee noted that these 
measures are just part of the unacceptable actions that have 
become a characteristic of the ruling Sudanese regime because of 
the internal and external crises gripping it. 
  The committee affirmed that Egypt cannot be provoked and 
deeply cares for the interests of the Sudanese people and the 
close relations between the two peoples, which no irresponsible 
behavior can harm.

  [Excerpt] Cairo, 30 May (MENA) -- Interior Minister Hasan 
al-Alfi has emphasized that deceased lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith 
Madani was a link between terrorist Tal'at Yasin Hammam, who was 
killed in a confrontation with the police last month, and the 
sources abroad who finance terrorism. He noted that 
investigations have provided definite proof that the lawyer was 
involved in conveying instructions, receiving funds, and 
distributing them to the rest of the group members. Al-Alfi, 
who was speaking to members of the American Chamber of Commerce 
in Cairo today, said that Madani had been implicated in several 
previous cases and committed an act of terrorism in 1991. He 
noted that many documents and papers were seized with him and 
that he was detained after obtaining a permit from the Public 
Prosecution Office. 
  Al-Alfi said that all the procedures used regarding lawyer 
Madani were legal and that not even the emergency law was used 
against him or against any other. He said: We were concerned 
to detain this man and to keep him alive but his health 
condition led to his death and thus we lost much information 
that we were supposed to obtain from him. 
  Al-Alfi said that what the lawyer's colleagues did was 
attempt to exploit his death by instigating public opinion 
against the Interior Ministry and the police. They made 
mendacious claims for purposes of instigation. He pointed out 
that the law passed by the People's Assembly--the legislative 
power--bans marches, so the security men had to confront any 
acts of violence or riots. He said that anyone who wants to 
protest must do so inside their association, or a delegation can 
submit objections to the Presidency but must not stage marches 
or demonstrations. 
  Responding to a question by a member of the American Chamber 
of Commerce about numerous complaints of maltreatment of the 
public at police posts, al-Alfi stressed that this issue is a 
great source of concern, noting that there is no doubt that 
there should be amity and mutual respect between the police and 
public, since it is their information that has greatly helped 
the security forces to detain terrorists. He noted that the 
Interior Ministry will appoint a public relations officer for 
every police post to serve as a link between individuals and the 
security agency. 
  Responding to a question on the Muslim Brotherhood's stance, 
role, and its relations with the extremists, al-Alfi said that 
it is obvious that the incidents that occurred in the Lawyers 
Syndicate were perpetrated by people who with records and whose 
affiliations are known. 
  In reply to a question about the security situation in Egypt 
and its effect on the volume of investment and businessmen's 
activities, al-Alfi said that all news agencies' reports on lack 
of security in Egypt are untrue. He said that Egypt is one of 
he safest places in the world and that everyone can safely walk 
Cairo's streets day or night, which is not common in many 
countries of the world. 
  Answering a question on human rights violations in Egypt, 
al-Alfi affirmed that there are no violations, noting that 
Egypt, with its ancient civilization will not besmirch its noble 
civilization with such acts. He said that best proof that there 
are no violations is the group of prisoners who were recently 
released from Mazra'at Turrah prison after they declared their 
repentance. He said that had any of these detainees suffered 
any abuse, it would have become known. He stressed that if the 
ministry used violence with prisoners, no one would come to 
court alive. He said that human rights is one of the most 
important subjects taught at the police academy. He noted that 
every security man knows well what human rights are and how to 
treat a defendant. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Statement issued by Muslim Brotherhood "on recent events in </F>
the country"; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Egypt and the Arab and Islamic nations are going 
through a crucial stage in their current history. Attempts to 
incite trouble and discord between the people and their 
governments are no secret to anyone, nor are the obvious 
conspiracies to break up a united people and fragment and 
partition their united homeland. 
  As a result of this deteriorating situation, many people 
have 
been killed, stability has been lost, and peace and security 
vanished. 
  The Muslim Brotherhood announces that its program for 
teaching the ways of God the Almighty and religion is a peaceful 
program based on awakening Islamic feeling, reviving belief in 
people's hearts, educating the nation in knowledge, work, and 
morals, and spreading a spirit of sacrifice, jihad, and 
dedication among the Islamic people to ascend from the abyss of 
backwardness and work on building the unity of the nation. To 
achieve this, the Muslim Brotherhood gets its inspiration from 
the words of justice, blessed may they be: Invite all to the 
way of thy Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching; and argue 
with them in ways that are best and most gracious [Koranic 
verse], as well as in the Almighty's words: Let there arise from 
you a band of people inviting all that is good, enjoying what is 
right and forbidding what is wrong [Koranic verse]. At the same 
time, the Brotherhood shows respect for constitutions and laws 
and works through them to achieve the interests of the country 
and the people such as public freedoms, respect for human 
rights, and justice among people. 
  This has been manifested by the fact that the Brotherhood 
has 
taken part in all aspects of life within the framework of the 
constitution and laws in force. Brotherhood members have 
participated in local and parliamentary councils, professional 
associations, and other such institutions along with other 
political parties and forces. Thus, they were hoping to reform 
the situation through the words of justice, open dialogue, 
constructive opinion, impartial criticism, and honorable 
opposition. 
  There have been bitter acts of violence for many reasons 
ever 
since the Muslim Brotherhood emerged from the prisons nearly a 
quarter of a century ago. Not a single member of the Muslim 
Brotherhood took part in these events. On the contrary, the 
Brotherhood condemns these incidents because it considers such 
events a departure from the right course in preaching the ways 
of God, the Almighty, and a distancing from the path it follows. 
The president of the republic said this in statements to the 
French newspaper LE MONDE on 1 November last year. The 
president then said about the Muslim Brotherhood: It is an 
Islamic movement that has opted for political struggle rather 
than violence. Former Egyptian interior ministers at various 
stages have also stated these facts. The latest of these was a 
statement by Interior Minister Hasan al- Alfi in his news 
conference published in AL-AHRAM and AL-JUMHURIYAH on 14 April 
1994. This is evidence of the innocence of the Muslim 
Brotherhood of such accusations which are made indiscriminately 
without any backing or proof. 
  Thousands of defendants have been tried in numerous cases 
and 
thousands of others were arrested. The Brotherhood's clear and 
explicit stance on these issues is evidence of its commitment to 
its wise plan in preaching the ways of God through conviction 
and confirmation. 
  The Muslim Brotherhood is not, and will not be a group 
advocating sedition and trouble, and will not be the cause of 
revolution or clashes. However, the absence of a response to 
the demands of the people, the delay in reforms, coupled with 
the big deterioration in services and disregard for man's basic 
rights, in addition to failure to provide the necessary 
guarantees for freedom of elections, some of these points, in 
fact all of them, are what is causing concern and fear regarding 
the deterioration of the situation to a unacceptable state. 
  May God protect Egypt from the evil of schemers and keep all 
harmful things at bay.

<F P=106> [Interview with Muslim Brotherhood spokesman Counselor </F>
Ma'mun al-Hudaybi by Muhammad Raghib; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Raghib] In an interview with DER SPIEGEL, President 
Husni Mubarak accused the Brotherhood of being an illegal 
organization involved in most terrorist activities. How does 
the Brotherhood respond to this accusation? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] President Mubarak himself, in a recent visit to 
Europe, told the French newspaper LE MONDE that the Muslim 
Brotherhood is a moderate group that shuns terror and expresses 
its views through peaceful means. Interior Minister Hasan 
al-Alfi, less than a month ago, also said that the Brotherhood 
shuns violence and terror and believes in peaceful means. 
Therefore, I do not know why there has been such a change of 
heart. 
  [Raghib] How do you explain this reversal of attitude toward 
your group. Which interpretation do you think is correct? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] For the past 25 years, our record has been 
clean. Every investigation into acts of violence committed 
during this period came to the inevitable conclusion that the 
Muslim Brotherhood is not involved in violence or linked with 
terror in any way. 
  Furthermore, we have taken part in the People's Assembly 
elections in 1984 and 1987. We had a respectable number of 
deputies in the Assembly. We participated in parliamentary life 
in a serious way. No one ever accused us of breaking the law or 
deviating from the constitution. 
  We also have members in the current municipal councils who 
have never violated the law. Some of our members have been 
elected to boards of prestigious professional associations and 
performed services that have been greatly commended. Their 
conduct and unionist work fell within the constitutional, legal, 
and legitimate boundaries and evoked nothing but praise. No one 
accused them of committing any act of violence. Their actions 
speak louder than words. 
  [Raghib] Recent incidents in the Bar Association sparked off 
accusations that the Brotherhood is using the Association for 
illegal purposes. Pro-government writers have repeatedly made 
this claim. How do you respond to such an accusation? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] The Brotherhood is opposed to violence. I am 
not well-informed about Bar Association events because I have 
been sick lately. But allow me to say, for starters, that the 
authority that is entitled to make such accusations is the 
Public Prosecution Office, which has not said anything so far. 
The accusations that were made came from the Interior Ministry, 
an authority which, in our opinion, is not entitled to issue 
charges. 
  The whole controversy and the attendant speculations and 
accusations could have been avoided had the coroner's report on 
the causes of death of lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani been 
published. The issue is not whether Madani belonged or did not 
belong to terrorist organizations, but whether he was tortured 
or not. 
  [Raghib] The Brotherhood issued a statement last Thursday 
denying that it calls for sedition. What did the statement aim 
to achieve, and why was it issued at this very moment? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] We issued this statement to refute the 
accusations leveled upon us. We aimed to answer all those who 
took the opportunity to defame and assail the Brotherhood. 
  The Brotherhood has taken part in a lot of political and 
social events in Egypt and other countries. We did our bit 
during the October 1992 earthquake. Many of our members offered 
professional care to the victims. This was a peaceful effort, a 
work of charity. On the external level, we have helped out in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and other areas. 
  [Raghib] You know and we know that the Muslim Brotherhood's 
activities have so far been banned. Are there any other 
channels that the Brotherhood is using to carry out its 
political and social activities? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] No. There are no illegal channels for either 
political or social activities. All of our activities are 
carried out in public. All the Brotherhood members are known to 
the state's official departments. There is no reason why we 
should work in secret. All of our statements and activities are 
done in public within the framework of the constitution and law. 
  [Raghib] The Muslim Brotherhood has a long history of 
violence since its establishment in 1928. Some reports indicate 
that the cornerstone of the Brotherhood's old military 
organization is that it supports current terrorist actions with 
the aim of changing the regime. Is this true? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] The Brotherhood is neither involved nor has 
anything to do with the current events. We have no members who 
act outside the Brotherhood's framework. As for the 
Brotherhood's history since its establishment, its policies 
before the revolution were directed against the Jews and 
colonialists. The Brotherhood had its excuses for that. But now 
times have changed and the situation is different. The reports 
that the remnants of the military organization are working to 
overthrow the regime are baseless. They are all rumors 
propagated by our enemies who know that they are false. 
Therefore, I decline to elaborate on the issue. 
  [Raghib] What about the Salsabil Computer Company's case 
which was blamed on a secret organization of the Brotherhood. 
Is not that true? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] It was not really an accusation incriminating 
the Brotherhood. Had it been true, none of the defendants would 
have been released from the prison. Therefore, we do not 
consider it as an incriminating factor or an accusation. The 
Brotherhood has no links whatsoever with this company. 
  [Raghib] What about the Muslim Brotherhood's ties with its 
counterparts in Arab and foreign countries? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] Our relations with the Muslim Brotherhood 
abroad 
are far from being secret. We attend seminars and conferences 
held by the Brotherhood in any Arab or foreign country. We 
attend these meetings by invitation. We discuss the status of 
the Brotherhood in each country and we assess everything that 
concerns the Islamic countries. But in Egypt we are not allowed 
to hold such seminars or conferences or to invite any 
representative of the Brotherhood from abroad. 
  [Raghib] Who currently finances the Brotherhood? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] Any able member of the Brotherhood can donate 
according to his limit, but the public donations are published 
in the press. These donations are deposited in the banks' 
accounts and are inspected by the Central Auditing Agency. This 
is the situation. The Brotherhood has no specific financial 
sources from either inside or outside. 
  [Raghib] You certainly want to take part in the national 
dialogue and the regime is refusing to allow this. What is the 
solution? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] I have nothing to say on this subject. The 
issue of national dialogue has become effaced and is not listed 
on our agenda. We are not thinking of taking part in this 
dialogue when it is held.

  [Text] Cairo, 30 May (MENA) -- Interior Minister Hasan 
al-Alfi has affirmed the importance of the media in confronting 
extremism and the extremists. He said in statements today that 
Egypt will never lapse into a state of anarchy nor will it move 
away from the law which it set 7,000 years ago. 
  He pointed out that there is a group belonging to the Muslim 
Brotherhood which has been involved in financing terrorist 
groups. He said that he would not reveal how many people there 
are because all the facts are now before the prosecution and 
will be revealed at the appropriate time. 
  He said that the Interior Ministry will not stop confronting 
terrorism. 
  The interior minister said that there are continuous and 
extensive campaigns against those trading in cassettes with 
recordings of calls for extremism and that the ministry is in 
the process of submitting a law that increases punishment for 
such merchants. 
  On the other hand, during his meeting today with a group of 
businessmen from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Cairo, Mr. 
Hasan al-Alfi affirmed that the progress the Interior Ministry 
has achieved in imposing its control over the terrorist elements 
did not come in a vacuum but resulted from following a 
scientific system of training, modernization, and development in 
all the agencies, in addition to coordination and 
comprehensiveness in all the ministry's departments. 
  Al-Alfi said during the meeting that the Interior Ministry 
now has a large data base on all those who carry out terrorist 
acts whether inside Egypt or outside it. He praised the 
Egyptian people, who are now providing all sorts of help to the 
security organs. 
  On the other hand, Mr. Muhammad Shafiq Jabir, deputy 
chairman 
of the American Chamber of Commerce in Cairo, affirmed in 
statements on the sidelines of the meeting that the Chamber, 
which represents 650 companies operating in Egypt, is convinced 
that the Interior Ministry is not sparing any effort in exposing 
all the facts. 
  He said that the security situation in Egypt is now more 
stable than it was before, as a result of the successive 
security sweeps and the successes the Egyptian Interior Ministry 
has had in confronting the terrorists. He said that foreign 
media reporting on Egypt has improved immensely. 
  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Cairo had asked Mr. Hasan 
al-Alfi to hold a meeting to discuss the security situation in 
Egypt and its relationship to encouraging investment in Egypt. 
  The meeting was attended by a number of prominent figures 
from the Interior Ministry and ranking businessmen, as well as 
members of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and some economists from 
Egypt.

<F P=106> [Report by Aluf Ben and 'Amira Segev] </F>
  [Excerpts] Over the last few days, Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin decided on a series of measures to curtail Palestinian 
national activities in Jerusalem, thus heeding the 
recommendations of senior security elements to set "red lines" 
for the activities of the Palestinians in the eastern part of 
the city. 
  Rabin decided that Israel would henceforth bar the 
establishment and operation of political Palestinian bodies in 
Jerusalem. He ruled that only the Israeli Police is authorized 
to maintain security and enforce the law and that consequently 
the activities of Palestinian security bodies in the city should 
be prevented. 
  The prime minister instructed Israel Police and security 
elements to meticulously monitor what goes on at Orient House 
(seat of the Palestinian delegation in East Jerusalem) and 
immediately terminate any illegal activities detected in the 
place. 
  After being briefed about the activities of the Palestinian 
rejectionist organizations in East Jerusalem, Rabin instructed 
security elements and Israel Police to conduct a thorough 
investigation into their activities and to close down any 
institution or body affiliated with them. [passage omitted] 
  At yesterday's meeting of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and 
Defense Committee, Likud Knesset Member Beni Begin quoted Faysal 
al-Husayni as stating in a news conference at Orient House on 
Sunday that "Jerusalem will be the capital of Palestine." 
According to Begin, "the Arabs claim they were given a 
commitment to discuss the future of Jerusalem. Knowing Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres, I suggest that we believe them." 
  Reacting to this allegation, Rabin said that "to the best of 
my knowledge, 'Arafat was given an excerpt of Peres' speech in 
the Knesset about freedom of worship and free access to the 
Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem. Even today, the Arabs are in 
charge of administering their holy shrines." 
  A senior PLO official stated yesterday that Israel and the 
PLO had exchanged official messages about the status of the 
Palestinian institutions in East Jerusalem. The exchange took 
place in February, in the final days of the deliberations about 
the first Cairo agreement. 
  "We are not talking about a section of the Cairo agreement, 
but about an exchange of messages signed by the most senior 
officials on both sides in the final days of the negotiations 
about the first Cairo agreement," the senior PLO official 
asserted. 
  The messages deal with the status quo in Jerusalem in 
general, and that of the Palestinian institutions in particular. 
They include a general commitment on the part of Israel to 
honor the existence of these institutions and to abstain from 
taking any measures that might adversely affect them. The names 
of the institutions in question are not cited in the messages. 
  An urgent debate on the issue was held yesterday in 
al-Husayni's office at Orient House, with the participation of 
the directors of Palestinian institutions in and outside 
Jerusalem and other figures. The participants would not divulge 
the content of the deliberations or the resolutions adopted.

  [Text] Environmental Affairs Minister Yosi Sarid says all 
Palestinian autonomy offices must be in Jericho or the Gaza 
Strip. He also said that any PLO presence in Jerusalem must be 
authorized by Israel. David Ze'ev reports from the Knesset: 
  [Begin Ze'ev recording] Cabinet Minister Yosi Sarid 
presented the following statement in the name of the government 
before the Knesset plenum: One, that institutions of the 
Palestinian self-rule authority will be in the Gaza Strip or the 
Jericho area, and only there. Two, any organizational activity 
that is diplomatic or resembles diplomatic activity that relates 
to Palestinian rule or resembles it in Jerusalem will require 
the endorsement of Israeli authorities, and each case will be 
examined by Israel based on the accord with the PLO. And three, 
there is only one police force in Jerusalem -- Israeli, not 
Palestinian, and security and public order in Jerusalem is the 
responsibility of the Israeli police force, no other. That 
would be forbidden and will not be permitted, in Sarid's words. 
Minister Sarid said he has spoken out against the statements of 
PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat in the past and is repeating that 
'Arafat will have to renew his commitment to the accord in 
words; more importantly, in actions. But, said Sarid, the 
situation on the ground is a positive surprise. The 
Palestinians, he says, are doing their job under the toughest 
conditions. [end recording]. 
  Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert says he will do everything in 
his 
power to close Orient House. He was speaking in London at a 
gathering sponsored by the JEWISH QUARTERLY JOURNAL. Jerry 
Lewis has details: 
  [Begin recording] [Lewis] Ehud Olmert said that Orient 
House was the headquarters of what originally was the Society 
for Arab Studies, sponsored by Faysal al-Husayni. However, 
lately it turned out to be the headquarters of what he says 
Faysal al-Husayni thought was the future government of the 
Palestinian state in Jerusalem. 
  [Olmert] My personal position and my official position as 
mayor of Jerusalem is that Orient House ought to be closed, and 
I will do everything I can in my power to close it. The Orient 
House is acting against the laws of the State of Israel. When 
it acts to divide the city it is an outright violation of the 
criminal law of Israel that forbids any action that may 
jeopardize the status of Jerusalem as the exclusive united 
capital of the state of Israel. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Jerusalem"] </F>
  [Text] Faysal al-Husayni, the autonomy's "minister on 
Jerusalem affairs," yesterday declared war for Jerusalem. He 
demands that "status quo" be preserved in the city and vows that 
Arabs will pursue their struggle for city control. He is not 
speaking of negotiations, he is speaking of control. Agreements 
are the last thing on his mind, and he is, as a matter of fact, 
saying precisely the same things his master 'Arafat did, 
although he is using more refined phrases. 
  His remarks are neither baloney nor poppycock. They demand a 
reaction, an immediate one. The required reaction is clear: 
The Orient House offices must be closed down, all PLO offices 
-- however they may be disguised or named -- must be moved from 
Jerusalem to Gaza or Jericho, and an unequivocal clarification 
must be issued -- in deed, not in words -- that the autonomy 
will not penetrate Jerusalem, either overtly or covertly. 
  As far as we are concerned, al-Husayni's remarks, too, are a 
call for jihad, a jihad without the commentators' smart-alecky 
interpretations. The only difference between the PLO head and 
his representative in Jerusalem is that 'Arafat made his remarks 
in Johannesburg, in what he believed was a closed setting. 
Al-Husayni dares make his statements in Jerusalem, striving to 
do it as publicly as possible.

<F P=106> [Report by Alon Ben-David] </F>
  [Excerpts] What is happening in the negotiations with 
Syria? Not much. Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin today dismissed 
as total nonsense reports that he had told Egyptian President 
Husni Mubarak that Israel would agree to implement a full 
withdrawal on the Golan Heights. Rabin was speaking before the 
Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. Rabin added that 
in his opinion, the United States had exhausted its role in the 
negotiations with Syria and expressed the assessment that the 
talks in Washington would not resume. [passage omitted] 
  The prime minister opined that the Syrians would not 
continue 
the talks in Washington. Incidentally, Mr. Rabin said that the 
talks held in Washington so far had led to nothing. Rabin also 
sent a message to the Americans: I believe that Washington has 
already exhausted its role with regard to the Syrian track, he 
said. Israel, however, continues to have an interest in 
occasional visits by Secretary of State Warren Christopher. I 
am neither pessimistic nor optimistic, the prime minister 
concluded. 
  The Palestinian institutions in Jerusalem were also 
discussed 
at the session. We are currently preparing a list of all the 
Palestinian institutions and examining the issue not on the 
basis of goodwill but rather from the viewpoint of the legal 
measures at our disposal, Rabin said. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ambassador Itamar Rabinovich in </F>
Washington by Razi Barqay -- live] 
  [Text] [Barqay] Professor Rabinovich, can we get a 
response from you to the report in Syria's TISHRIN newspaper 
attacking Prime Minister Rabin's remarks that Syria is the one 
not prepared for a peace accord with Israel; its call on United 
States to fulfill its role of an honest broker; and that if it 
fails, the Syrians expect the United States to take partial 
responsibility for the failure? Have we a ready-made reaction? 
  [Rabinovich] I do not see the point of such a debate. One 
of the points of symmetry with the Syrians is that their media 
is official. When TISHRIN publishes a report or a commentary it 
can be viewed as a sort of official view. Nevertheless, I still 
do not think we should argue with the Syrian press or argue 
whether it is right for the so-called Syrian media to attack the 
prime minister. I believe that if the Syrian leadership has 
something to say it can do so on its own. 
  [Barqay] Then let us argue with President Mubarak, who said 
that he has a promise from Yitzhaq Rabin to come down from the 
Golan Heights. His remarks were taped by journalists who met 
with him. You know the prime minister's response: It is utter 
nonsense. 
  [Rabinovich] If you want to bring another element into the 
issue, then go ahead. In reference to the Egyptian position, 
the only third element active in the negotiations between us and 
the Syrians is the United States. You referred to them as a 
mediator. The U.S. role is not exactly that of a mediator, but 
rather what they call an intermediary [preceding word in 
English], because the word mediator implies somebody who makes 
his own bridging proposals, which is not the case in these 
negotiations. Egypt is not a mediator between us and Syria, and 
does not act as an intermediary, therefore the Egyptian 
Government cannot have a deep knowledge of what is taking place 
in these negotiations. 
  [Barqay] I understand. Now tell me, are the Syrian 
negotiations really stuck? 
  [Rabinovich] The negotiations with the Syrians are not 
moving at this moment. The secretary of state is prepared to 
come to the region once more, but he is not prepared to come for 
nothing. The main diplomatic activity in Washington at present 
is in an attempt to find out if there is any purpose in the 
secretary coming. The address is first and foremost Damascus. 
The Syrians must make it clear that there is a point to an 
additional mission to the region by the secretary of state. The 
harsh reaction by TISHRIN can be attributed to the Syrian 
feeling that there is a general conception that the ball is in 
their court and they are trying any way they can to get it 
across the net. 
  [Barqay] What will move the negotiations, which are 
deadlocked, along? What will make one of the sides move forward? 
  [Rabinovich] In reference to the TISHRIN report, it can 
immediately be discerned that it is a legalistic and formal 
approach, which states that Israel must first implement the UN 
resolutions and give its representatives a commitment, etc. 
That approach is legalistic and formal and not one for 
political negotiations. Political negotiations are talks 
between two sides who want to reach a joint purpose, who present 
their interests and outlooks, and then together -- sometimes 
with the assistance of a third party, which in this case is the 
United States -- take note of the points where their outlooks, 
starting positions, and interests meet. That is the fertile 
ground where negotiations can progress. What the Syrians must do 
is move away from the mentality of a legalistic approach and 
take a practical political approach to the negotiations.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yo'el Marcus: "A Yo-Yo in the Land of </F>
Monkeys' Uncles"] 
  [Excerpts] State Comptroller Miryam Ben-Porat's reply to 
Rabin's question, "Who is she to squawk about the PALMAH 
[prestate underground]?" -- "I am the state comptroller" -- is 
totally irrelevant. Who is she to tell Rabin who she is and 
what her job is? Who is she to speak of good manners and tell 
him that a man is as good as his style? Had the Wild West used 
tongues instead of guns, Rabin could have been our own Gary 
Cooper or Clint Eastwood. [passage omitted] 
  Despite the impression of army camaraderie projected by 
expressions such as "if pigs could fly," "I don't give a damn," 
or "If that is a settlement, then I am a monkey's uncle," so 
frequently used by Rabin, there is method to his madness, to 
paraphrase Shakespeare. Proof: We have never heard Rabin use 
offensive names for Arye Der'i, for instance. Der'i is the man 
who encouraged Peres to break up the unity government, and yet 
the term "foul maneuver" was attached to Peres. Not a bad word 
about Der'i -- either then or today -- although he has been 
giving Rabin a hard time, sending him like a "yo-yo" -- Rabin's 
term for other circumstances -- back and forth to 'Ovadya Yosef. 
  You will not hear Rabin thrash out at former generals, even 
when they are his sworn political enemies. Yet wherever Peres 
is involved, Rabin shoots off his mouth indiscriminately. He 
invented the term "suits" for Peres' aides. "Peres is selling 
historic processes for the price of a newspaper headline," Rabin 
says about the man "who has never served in the Army." Beilin 
the poodle [term used by Rabin in a radio interview] is 
sometimes referred to as one who acts "brainlessly" and at other 
times as one suffering from "a loss of brains." Rabin must find 
it infuriating to realize that he is treading the path beaten by 
that group and even speaking their lingo (and referring to the 
IDF [Israel Defense Forces] as the "occupying army" -- God in 
heaven!). Who are they to tell him what to do and how to speak? 
  Rabin is a blend of suspiciousness -- everyone is after his 
head -- and a sense of arrogance of a man who knows everything 
better than everyone else. That is the reason he is sometimes 
the commentator and at other times, the state comptroller. He 
speaks of "chatterboxes" in the context of discussions on stock 
exchange taxation, and complains that "the finance minister is 
mushily pondering new national priorities." Being certain that 
everyone is after his head, everything is personal with him: He 
disqualifies the contender, rather than the bone of contention. 
Everything is "baloney," everything is "bull." 
  Not only is he unable to take criticism, he is mainly unable 
to take alternative opinions. He has trained his ministers and 
aides to acquiesce to a degree unheard of even in the days of 
autocratic Ben-Gurion and Begin. People are afraid of his 
tongue. And we get goose pimples at the thought of how 
decisions are made in our country. 
  As time went on, all the independent bodies and authorities 
got on his nerves. For Rabin, the justice minister has long 
since become anathema because he routinely sides with the law. 
Rabin coined various phrases to denigrate the legal 
establishment's independent status. He speak enviously about 
the PLO, which will be able to rule Gaza "without the High Court 
of Justice and Betzelem." He does not miss an opportunity to 
scourge the Histadrut labor federation, which he considers to be 
the source of all his troubles (and recently, of his mistakes as 
well). He compares the trade unions to Islamic terrorism and 
yearns for Singapore, "where there is no Histadrut and no 
nonsense." Rabin is particularly enraged by the independence of 
Knesset committees. He terms the Finance Committee "one of the 
sewers in which government decisions are stuck." He considers 
television to be a yellow media: "Do people pay their fees for 
this?" almost amounts to a call for civil disobedience. The 
overt deprecation of independent bodies, especially those aimed 
at setting limits and defining what is permissible and what not, 
has gradually resulted in a "Nixonian rule" in the Prime 
Minister's Office, which considers itself to be an imperial 
structure disconnected from all the other power structures, and 
whose main aim is self-preservation. 
  What one perceives at the present time is an extremely 
pressured Rabin. Perhaps Rabin is beginning to suffer from the 
syndrome of the leader who senses he has reached a dead end. 
This is not the first time: Only Menahem Begin, as leader of 
Herut, was able to give up the entire Sinai and to demolish 
settlements in exchange for a breakthrough in the peace process 
with Egypt -- after which he exhausted himself. Only Rabin, 
with the security aura attached to his name, could recognize the 
PLO and 'Arafat and implement autonomy in Gaza and Jericho. 
Perhaps, however, Rabin -- like Begin at the time -- has made 
all the concessions he is capable of or wiling to make. Perhaps 
deep down inside he knows that he has exhausted his potential. 
This is why he is coming down on everybody like a yo-yo in the 
land of monkeys' uncles.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Daniyel Bloch: "No Crisis and No Nothing"] </F>
  [Text] Last weekend's press was preoccupied mainly with 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's utterances. Only a few writers 
addressed matters of substance. Rabin has never professed to be 
the consummate diplomatic speaker Abba Eban is, or the speech 
purist that Shim'on Peres is. For better and for worse, one of 
his most prominent qualities is the harmony of his mouth with 
his heart. He says what he thinks. Literati will define it as 
credibility, and it was because of his credibility that he was 
elected to his position both in Labor primaries and in the 
national elections. He is not going to change in his eighth 
decade, and despite all the criticism leveled at him, I have not 
detected any strong public nostalgia for his predecessor, 
Yitzhaq Shamir, who was not an Abba Eban disciple in the 
mysteries of diplomacy either. Likewise, I sense no ardent 
longing for the predictable leadership of Binyamin Netanyahu, 
and no walls moved at the news of the prospective participation 
in the premiership race of Ari'el Sharon, who -- with his 
typical tact -- chose the period of memorial days for the fallen 
of the Lebanon War, that unnecessary war, to make his 
announcement. Another candidate who has announced his 
intentions, Refa'el Eytan, is not famous for dainty speech 
either. 
  True, the state comptroller reminded us that a man is as 
good 
as his style, but the style is affected by the job. Style 
required of a judge or a state comptroller is not equal to that 
expected from a Knesset member; ministers' and politicians' 
style is not expected to emulate that of teachers and rabbis. 
In some positions, we expect officials to conform with a 
certain style, and if they do not, they should be ousted. In 
some elected positions, all we can do is put the elected 
official's deeds, misdeeds, and style up for the electors' 
scrutiny once every few years. 
  It is doubtful whether many of the prime minister's 
political 
supporters disagree with his approach to matters of substance, 
with the exception of one. The only matter on which many sense 
Rabin went too far in style as well as content was his blatant 
criticism of the state comptroller. But do many people think 
Netzarim is a genuine settlement, one so important that it must 
not be removed at any cost, under any conditions? Does Netzarim 
contribute to national security, or is it a burden on the 
security forces? Of course, Rabin could have phrased this 
sentiment differently, but no refined expression would have 
changed the substance. And do many people, including right-wing 
supporters, believe the vagrant yeshiva in Jericho's Rachel's 
Tomb is important? The fact that Hanan Porat, the national 
martyr, sits there rolling his eyes heavenward, bestows no 
sanctity or religious significance on the site. Does every 
mosaic in Eretz Yisra'el automatically call for a yeshiva and 
the deployment of security forces in the defense of every 
fanatic drawn to it? Is there such a dearth of yeshivas and 
synagogues in the country that holy studies can be held only in 
Jericho? And since when is Jericho a holy city, and who has 
lifted the ancient ban on it? 
  The prime minister provided the media, which has to fill 
pounds of paper for the weekend press, with topics. But their 
alacrity was exaggerated in most cases. It is too soon to mourn 
the Rabin government or draw its balance sheet, although it will 
mark two years in office in six weeks. It should be said in the 
prime minister's credit that so far, he has carried out the main 
objective he undertook when he was elected: He has promoted the 
peace process. In domestic and economic spheres, insufficient 
results of the declared intention to change national priorities 
are discernible, but there are signs of improvement in several 
fields. There are signs of certain growth and of falling 
unemployment. There have been important developments in the 
spheres of foreign trade and investment. Serious steps were 
made toward infrastructure development. The pace is inadequate, 
and more should be done. But bureaucracy gets in the way, and 
Treasury officials, the "Fogels" -- one of the prime minister's 
most justified verbal coinages -- often act as if the Likud was 
still in power, exploiting the finance minister's frequent 
preoccupation with other matters. 
  In the near future, we would expect the prime minister to do 
more and to decide on many issues that were delayed during the 
negotiations with the Palestinians. We hope he will decide on 
the next health minister today. If there is any truth to the 
rumors that Rabin's candidate is Efrayim Sne, then it is an 
excellent choice, both for the health and the political systems. 
The 50-year- old Sne is member of the younger Labor party 
generation, and he is undoubtedly an asset in many fields. His 
appointment would be a precedent of the right man getting the 
right job, and we hope it will bode well for the future. If 
Rabin decides to appoint another minister so as to maintain 
inner balance, the candidate will be apparently Deputy Foreign 
Minister Yosi Beilin, who has made a long way from his "poodle" 
days. The choice is undoubtedly difficult, but high-ranking 
positions will await the other candidates in a not- too-distant 
future. Many would like to see Avraham Burg as Zionist 
Federation chairman and Hagay Merom as party secretary general. 
In the meantime, the prime minister must decide also on his 
nominees for cabinet secretary and media adviser. These key 
positions must not be left unmanned for long. Rabin must 
highlight his national and partisan leadership with more than 
blunt and stern utterances; he must do it by deed -- in Jericho 
and Netzarim, as well as in the government complex in Jerusalem 
and the Labor headquarters in Tel Aviv.

<F P=106> [Report by Aluf Ben] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's response yesterday 
to the report about a "Palestinian constitution" drafted by a 
French jurist at the request of PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat was 
one of derision. "It is all talk, just like the radio program," 
Rabin said. 
  On the other hand, senior political sources in Jerusalem 
said 
that preparing the constitution is "'Arafat's gravest violation 
of the Gaza-Jericho agreement so far," and that Israel's policy 
will be to make sure the Palestinians "stick to the letter" of 
the agreement. Political elements in Jerusalem are highly 
embarrassed by Rabin's speech on Wednesday in which he mocked 
'Arafat and described as utter nonsense the PLO head's remarks 
about a Palestinian state and Jerusalem. 
  Rabin's abrasive reaction and his responses of "utter 
nonsense" and "it is all talk" were viewed as ignoring the steps 
'Arafat has taken so as not to lose public support for the 
agreements with the PLO. The prime minister is expected to 
clarify his position today, and to stress the importance with 
which he views adherence to the spirit and letter of the 
agreement. 
  Senior security sources, headed by Lieutenant General Ehud 
Baraq, the chief of staff, and the Shin Bet head, recently 
called on the prime minister to make sure the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement is assiduously adhered to by the PLO and to react 
sharply to any violations. They warned the prime minister that 
if Israel ignores minor violations, the agreement might erode 
and Israel's security and citizens might be harmed. 
  A senior Israeli defense source said "we must insist on 
strict adherence to the agreement in the security field, and not 
permit anything that deviates from the terms of the agreement. 
We must be tough with them on every detail of the 
implementation." The same source warned that "the 
implementation will involve security and civilian problems, but 
the security aspect is more worrisome, therefore standing firm 
on security demands is the most important aspect for Israeli 
society." 
  He said that if the Palestinians do not institute reasonable 
security and effective control of Gaza and Jericho, Israel will 
be forced "to take a complementary series of steps to manifest 
our responsibility." Another senior element said in internal 
consultations that if the PLO has the will it can fulfill its 
commitments under the agreement despite the difficulties it is 
facing. Nevertheless, there might be violations, whether due to 
a deliberate policy by the Palestinian leadership or due to 
difficulties in understanding and coordination in the field. 
  Various security sources said in internal deliberations that 
the Palestinian leadership's activities in the Autonomy must be 
thoroughly overseen to make sure it does not foment an intifadah 
in the Jerusalem and West Bank areas remaining under Israeli 
control. The security sources stressed in particular the need to 
follow up on the PLO's promise not to harm collaborators in the 
territories. 
  Foreign Ministry Legal Adviser Yo'el Singer, who played a 
crucial role in drafting the agreement with the PLO, reacted 
sharply to 'Arafat's reference to jihad and his announcement to 
annul the military government's decrees in the territories. 
Singer called 'Arafat's action a violation of the agreement and 
said Israel has the right to respond with a violation for each 
violation, which is legitimate under international law. 
  "Our ability to react under the law is almost limitless," 
Singer said in internal consultations. Security elements in 
contact with the Palestinian police force in Gaza and Jericho 
however believe it is premature to evaluate the PLO's ability to 
implement the agreement, and an additional test period is 
required to learn the agreement and create understandings that 
will enable its implementation. Sources in the field believe 
that hitches in implementation are unavoidable at such an early 
stage.

  [Text] Two Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] fugitives 
were killed this afternoon in the village of al-Ram, north of 
Jerusalem, during an operation by the Shin Bet and the Israel 
Police special antiterror unit. 
  Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that one of the two men 
killed was Yusuf Naji, the murderer of the late Shin Bet agent 
No'am Kohen. As may be recalled, Naji was a former collaborator 
with the authorities and Kohen was his handler. 
  In the course of a meeting, Naji and his accomplices shot 
No'am Kohen and his two bodyguards. No'am Kohen died as a 
result of the shooting and the Shin Bet has been conducting a 
manhunt after Naji ever since.

  [Text] The prime minister's bureau yesterday denied that 
members of the Fatah Hawks had been recruited by the Palestinian 
police. The announcement came in reaction to a complaint 
submitted by the "View Toward Peace" [Mabat Leshalom] 
organization. 
  The bureau's announcement came in the wake of an 
investigation conducted by Brigadier General Yom-Tov Sami', head 
of the Israeli team at the joint security committee. 
  The communique stated that the Palestinians had said that 
the 
candidacies of all applicants to join the Palestinian police 
were brought before the committee. 
  The Palestinians also asserted that the Fatah Hawks had not 
been recruited but had only been concentrated in one location 
pending a decision on their future.

<F P=106> [Report by Roni Shaqed] </F>
  [Text] "Salaam 1 to Salaam 2, how are you doing, over and 
out." 
  "This is Salaam 2. All is well. What do you want?" 
  "Salaam 2, overtake me, we are entering a road under Israeli 
jurisdiction. According to regulations, you are supposed to 
lead the joint patrol on this road." 
  "Salaam 1, thank you. Am overtaking, follow me. Over and 
out." 
  This conversation in Arabic was held over the "peace" 
network 
in northern Jericho Tuesday [17 May] morning. 
  Salaam 2 -- an Israeli Border Police patrol jeep, and Salaam 
2 -- a patrol jeep of the PLO's al-Aqsa Brigade -- jointly 
patrolled road No. 90 from Jericho to al-'Awja'. The 
conversation was received in the joint PLO-Israeli operations 
room located on a military base in the Vered Yeriho junction, 
and was duly logged by the Palestinian duty officer. The same 
conversation was received in the al-Aqsa Brigade operations room 
in Jericho and the Border Police company's operations room in 
the Vered Yeriho junction. 
  The Salaam 2 jeep was commanded by a Border Police 
subinspector. Three policemen occupied the back seat -- two from 
the Border Police and one from Israel Police. They were 
carrying M-16's and wearing bulletproof vests. An orange flag 
-- the joint patrol's emblem -- was flying on the jeep's roof. 
  The Salaam 1 jeep -- a khaki-colored Palestinian Toyota -- 
was occupied by five solders and a lieutenant. Their appearance 
was much less uniform. The driver wore light khakis, the 
officer and three soldiers -- olive drabs. Each had different 
shoes on. As for the fifth soldier, he wore camouflage and a 
red beret. They were all cradling Kalashnikov rifles in their 
arms. Just like the Israeli jeep roof, theirs had an orange 
flag, but also a large Palestinian flag. 
  This week Jericho looked as if the messiah had already come. 
Yesterday's enemies were now pals. A peaceful honeymoon seemed 
to have followed the cross, grating wedding in Cairo three weeks 
earlier. 'Arafat and Rabin are cross, but in Jericho, 
Palestinian and Israeli soldiers -- perhaps still in shock at 
the first encounter -- managed to cooperate this week. And 
quite well, too. 
  Inspector Salah Khatib, a Galilee Druze Border Police 
officer, is the Israeli commander of the joint operations room. 
"I never dreamed of such a situation. The same man, who could 
have been at the other end of my gun a few days ago, is now 
sitting next to me. We shake hands. We have coffee together. 
We work in full cooperation. I am really enjoying every 
moment. Although it has not been long, there is a feeling of 
real friendship. We feel as if we have been working together 
for a long time." 
  Lieutenant Jum'a Marwan from the al-Aqsa Brigade is sitting 
next to him. He, too, is beaming: "Thank God, we are sitting 
together after 40 years of enmity. It is a dream. Sitting 
together in the same room with an Israeli officer, working on a 
joint security task -- it's a dream. We spend many hours 
together. We eat together. We talk. We cooperate like 
brothers. I hope all the agreements signed by Brother 
Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] will materialize." 
  So far, thank God, there have been no serious events to put 
the cooperation to a test. This idyll (or nightmare for 
pessimists) may evolve into a crisis soon enough. There are 
enough friction points both in Jericho and Gaza. A stone thrown 
at a Na'ama settler's car, hitting a child, or gunfire at a 
Qatif Bloc settler's car are an example of real-life events. 
Not to mention the formidable land mine created by the Shalom 
'Al Yisra'el synagogue. By the way, the fuse of this Jericho 
bomb may have been ignited this week. 
  The settlers came to the site carrying weapons. The 
Palestinians fumed. "They cannot bring weapons to prayer in a 
synagogue," Jericho military commander, Isma'il al-Hajj, 
grumbled. Faysal al-Husayni warned that the Hebron event is 
liable to recur in the Jericho synagogue. Under the agreement, 
an Israeli may carry licensed weapons when entering autonomy 
territory. "The agreement does not state that armed settlers 
may enter a synagogue," al- Husayni told the U.S. secretary of 
state, asking for his intervention. 
  But the settlers remained adamant. To their dismay, the 
agreement limited their presence at the synagogue to the time 
between 0900 and 1800, in a group not exceeding 30 worshipers. 
This week they demonstratively ignored the Palestinian 
soldiers. "We will not obey their orders," they declared. 
  The security cooperation was the result of the need to imbue 
complicated agreement clauses with content. The security 
responsibility distribution between Israel -- which is in charge 
of foreign security, settlement security, and the security of 
Israelis -- and the Palestinian authority -- which is in charge 
of internal security and public order enforcement in autonomy 
territory -- requires close cooperation between field soldiers. 
  To enable that, the sides established the JSC [preceding 
abbreviation in English], the Joint Coordination and Cooperation 
Committee, in which officers exchange information and guide the 
three DCO's [preceding abbreviation in English], the District 
Coordination and Cooperation Offices, which have been set up in 
Gaza, Khan Yunus, and Jericho. 
  The three coordination offices operate 24 hours a day as 
joint commands. The offices guide the joint patrols and the 
joint stationary patrols. 
  Patrols are carried out 24 hours every day along autonomy 
roads used by Israelis and the length of the shore opposite the 
Qatif Bloc. The joint patrol includes an Israeli jeep and a 
Palestinian jeep. The patrol is led by an Israeli vehicle on 
roads under Israeli jurisdiction and by a Palestinian one on 
roads for which Palestinians are responsible. 
  In addition, six joint mobile units have been deployed in 
the 
Nisanit junction, Netzarim junction, Kfar Darom junction, 
Sufa-Morag junction, Vered Yeriho junction, and in the vicinity 
of the Elisha' Nahal Brigade presettlement in northern Jericho. 
These units are the alert force. 
  The operations room of the Jericho regional coordination 
office at the military base near the Vered Yeriho checkpoint was 
inaugurated last Friday. "Authorized Personnel Only," its door 
says. 
  The trailer is partitioned into three sections: the Israeli 
command room, the Palestinian command room, and the joint 
operations room between these two. Two officers -- an Israeli 
and a Palestinian -- sit behind a large desk. The table 
accommodates a telephone, a radio, logs, and maps. The wall 
features a large 1:200,000 map of the autonomous areas. The map 
is in Hebrew and Arabic. The main traffic axes are prominently 
marked in purple. Another wall features a chart of the joint 
radio network in Hebrew and Arabic. "Salaam" (peace) is this 
extensive network's code name. All the checkpoints around 
Jericho, the Allenby Bridge, the joint patrols, and the troop 
commanders are linked up to it. 
  A list of duty officers and aides hangs on another wall. On 
the day we visited, the lists said: On the Israeli side, patrol 
commander is Lt. Amir, on the Palestinian side -- Lt. Hisham. 
Stationary force in Elisha': Israeli Lt. Bini and Palestinian 
Lt. Ashraf; in Vered Yeriho, Palestinian Lt. Anis and Israeli 
Lt. Dash. 
  Lt. Hani 'Iyad is sitting in the Palestinian operations 
room. 
He says his family are refugees from Zefat. He is quick with a 
smile, plump and bespectacled. The East Jerusalem daily AL-QUDS 
lies on his desk. Two soldiers sit on a bench in the corner 
next to him. They hold Kalashnikov rifles. "I have served in 
the Palestinian army since my youth many years ago," he says, 
then turns away to listen to a report on the radio network. 
  "Where are you from?" he asks. "From YEDI'OT AHARONOT," we 
reply, and he laughs. "I am familiar with it, you know. I read 
your newspaper. Even in Iraq, we used to get translations of 
your newspaper." 
  [Shaqed] How is the joint work with the Israelis going? 
  ['Iyad] Very well, thank God. There is no wall between us. 
We eat together, drink together, sit together. How are the 
Israelis? Ordinary people. They received us as a matter of 
course. Our coordination is built on understanding. We have not 
trained together yet, we are merely starting our cooperation. 
Regarding joint training and exercises, you should ask the 
command. I do not have the authority to answer that. 
  [Shaqed] What are your open-fire orders? 
  ['Iyad] The matter is clear to us. Any problem that arises 
should be solved quietly and amicably. Like brothers. In the 
Israeli areas, the solution of problems is up to the Israeli 
jeep, while in the Palestinian areas it is up to our jeep. God 
willing, there will be no problems. We have received orders to 
solve problems quietly and amicably. [end 'Iyad] 
  The Palestinian soldiers working in the regional 
coordination 
office are still accorded the "full board" treatment, which 
includes meals in the Israeli mess hall. The Palestinians have 
somewhat of a problem in this respect. They have a dining room 
in the administration building. Cooks, too. But they have no 
food. Funds pledged to the policing force have not arrived yet. 
In the meantime, Jericho residents are the suppliers of food 
and meals. A 16-member committee representing various major 
local families was established in the city to collect donations 
for the al-Aqsa Brigade. During the first week, they received 
free gasoline from a local gas station owner. 
  Colonel 'Ofer is the Israeli commander of the Jericho 
regional coordination unit. The Palestinian side is represented 
by Brig. Gen. Sa'di Naji, deputy commander of the al-Aqsa 
Brigade. A civilian-clad Brig. Gen. Naji secretly arrived in 
Jericho a week prior to the evacuation. He spent the nights at 
the home of 'Abd- al-Karim Sidar, the Fatah chief in Jericho, 
who briefed him about the city and its problems. He spent the 
days with Col. 'Ofer and other senior officers. He studied the 
roads, the various problems of the Jericho area, coordinated 
various necessary issues, and prepared the patrol troops 
induction. The preliminary preparations helped the joint force 
to perform efficiently from its first hours. 
  Col. 'Ofer: "There is a lot of goodwill on both sides, great 
willingness to listen, hash things out -- a definitely positive 
spirit. No social ties, though. We are two different sides, 
and we are here to do a job. No joint training is scheduled and 
none has been done so far." 
  Brig. Gen. Sa'di Naji is wearing a red beret and commando 
shoes. There are no decorations or emblems on his uniform, just 
a small metal Palestinian flag on his chest. He has a small 
two-way radio and a red attache case. He drives around Jericho 
in a Mercedes 230 loaned by a city resident, who has volunteered 
to chauffeur him around: "The synagogue is the most sensitive 
friction point we have in Jericho," he says as we drove to the 
site. When we got there, about 30 settlers, including Knesset 
Member Hanan Porat, were inside. The settlers ignored him 
almost completely. It was Brig. Gen. Naji's first-ever 
encounter with settlers. He, too, seemed to be experiencing a 
kind of a first-encounter shock. He made an effort to focus on 
security problems. "They are here in accordance with the 
agreement. I hope they are here to pray, not to stage a 
provocation. I further hope the problems will be solved through 
persuasion." 
  Brig. Gen. Naji was astounded to see weapons on the 
settlers' shoulders. Captain Muhammad Lutfi, the Palestinian 
security officer at the synagogue, did not exactly know what the 
instructions were. "The settlers are armed. I must be given 
instructions. Should they be allowed in with their arms or 
not?" he asked. A brief conversation with Col. 'Ofer solved the 
problem. "According to the agreement, they are allowed," he told 
his PLO counterpart. 
  The first mini-friction occurred last Friday. A group of 10 
Kakh members snuck into the synagogue after dark. The 
Palestinian soldiers summoned the joint patrol which evacuated 
the Kakh men from the area. Procedures worked. However, the 
real tests still lie ahead. 
  The joint patrol makes its way along Route 90 on an average 
of once every half an hour. The Palestinian vehicles 
occasionally change. Their car pool is still small, and 
consists of 10 Toyota and 8 Land Rover jeeps. The Land Rovers 
were given them as a gift by King Husayn when he bid farewell to 
the soldiers two hours before they entered Jericho. On the 
first day of the joint patrols it was the Israeli jeep that had 
problems. The Palestinian officer knew something about 
mechanics and helped repair it. 
  Moshe, a blue-uniformed Israeli policemen, regularly takes 
part in the patrols: "I do my job according to instructions, 
exactly by the book. The feeling is good. Personal relations 
have not yet emerged but, in my opinion, personal relations are 
not necessary in this job. They are serious in their attitude. 
They know how to speak on the radio in order to conduct the 
patrols properly. In this respect, they know their job." 
  We met Wa'il Muhammad Subhi in the Palestinian jeep. He 
comes from Kafr al-Labad near Tulkarm. He left the West Bank in 
1967 and joined the Palestinian Liberation Army. As soon as he 
gets his first leave he will visit his relatives in the village. 
At the moment, his wife and four children are still in Jordan. 
After three days of joint patrols Wa'il Muhammad manages to see 
the half-full cup: "We ate together, we smoked cigarettes 
together. It is 70-80 percent all right. We talked. They 
asked us about our past. We do not frighten them, and they do 
not frighten us. If only it remains this way."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Tzvi Bar'el: "What Counts Is That They Were </F>
Legally Elected"] 
  [Text] President Mubarak, King Husayn, King Fahd, the 
presidents of the five Muslim republics in the former USSR, and 
Yasir 'Arafat have a problem. National Security Adviser Anthony 
Lake recently issued a new dictum, whereby the U.S. 
administration would be prepared to cooperate with radical 
Muslim regimes as long as these were elected in democratic 
elections. 
  Although Lake and his aides did not use the words 
"fundamentalist regimes," they were primarily referring to 
extremist regimes rather than countries such as Saudi Arabia 
which has long been embraced by the United States. Lake did not 
specify the characteristics which would meet U.S. criteria, 
which led to a great deal of confusion in several Arab countries. 
  "I guess they mean well, but somehow they manage to hurt 
their friends," says an Egyptian official. "At a time when 
Egypt is beginning to prove its ability to fight fundamentalist 
terror, the United States displays an incomprehensible tilt 
toward extremist elements. What should President Mubarak infer 
from such a policy? Should he call off the elections for fear 
that the extremists might score more votes? Is that a signal to 
Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] in Israel to undermine the 
PLO's authority and to count on the support of the United States 
when it is elected?" 
  A White House official explained that the United States was 
getting ready for a possible scenario in Algeria, whereby the 
Islamic Salvation Front topples the regime (or, at least becomes 
a prominent part of it) if and when new elections are held. At 
present, such a possibility seems the only way to end the daily 
killings (a total of 700 fatalities since March) and to maintain 
some kind of order in a country that on the verge of general 
collapse. 
  Hence, in view of its experience with Iran, the United 
States 
decided to build a positive policy toward the regime it foresees 
as rising to power in Algeria. However, this would seem to 
provide a solution to one part of the Arab world and pose a 
serious problem to another part of it. 
  On the face of it, the new policy would seem to contain some 
logic, or at least a wish to secure U.S. interests. There is no 
Arab country that does not have to cope with, is not governed 
by, or does not share power with extreme Islamic elements to 
some extent or another. On one end of the scale lies Iran, on 
the other lie Syria and Iraq, and in the middle lie Jordan, 
Lebanon, Egypt, the Gulf states, the five Muslim republics in 
Central Asia; in fact, every Arab country with institutions that 
bear romantic names and shoot innocent people in the name of 
Islam. 
  How long can undemocratic regimes curb religious opposition 
movements which are seeking to install a worldwide Muslim regime 
but are in the meantime prepared to make do with wrecking the 
current regimes? Is the United States prepared to come to the 
aid of every regime seeking to eliminate its religious 
opposition? Is that possible? These questions featured 
prominently in various debates held by the U.S. Administration, 
which was anxious about the possibility that Iran, Sudan, and 
soon Algeria may be joined by other countries which will not 
just burn local law books but also the U.S. flag. 
  U.S. Administration officials realized that if such a 
scenario came true the United States might be left without any 
allies in parts of the Middle East and Central Asia, and it is 
against this background that the new policy announced by the 
national security adviser can be understood. What remains 
unknown is the conditions the U.S. Administration set for 
supporting extreme Muslim regimes. 
  If the administration intends to support only those Islamic 
regimes elected in democratic elections it is deluding itself on 
at least two counts. The only Arab country that has ever held 
democratic elections is Yemen, which is currently experiencing a 
tough war and where the tanks will probably determine who will 
rise to power. All other Arab countries may call their 
elections democratic, but it is their rulers who determine how 
democratic the elections or their regimes are. If 
fundamentalist regimes rise to power, they will most probably 
follow the Afghan model, which is partially being implemented in 
Algeria: street fights, guerrilla warfare, sweeping the poor 
classes, eliminating the intelligentsia, splitting the army, and 
ultimately seizing power. 
  The second count is even worse. The administration need only 
check the results of democratic elections in most African 
countries and in those Arab countries that hold some kind of 
elections to conclude that democratic elections do not guarantee 
democratic regimes. The U.S. Administration actually made clear 
that only legitimate regimes, however ruthless and corrupt they 
may be, will enjoy U.S. support. The caveat of democratic 
elections was merely designed to give a guise of legitimacy to 
the continued U.S. relations with and support of such countries. 
  Arab regimes, at least those considered pro-Western, have 
reason to be upset by this U.S. policy; the Americans have 
reason to worry that such long-term policy might destroy U.S. 
interests any time down the line.

  [Excerpts] Most Likud leaders oppose Ari'el Sharon's plans 
to run for the premiership in the next elections. [passage 
omitted] 
  Interviewed by Qol Yisra'el, Knesset Member [MK] Yitzhaq 
Shamir said MK Sharon had better find other occupations more 
beneficial to the national interests rather than go on with his 
conspiracies to become the Likud's candidate for the 
premiership. Shamir added that the actions of Sharon, who 
always conspired against his superiors, harm the Likud and 
delight the left-wing camp. 
  Likud chairman Moshe Qatzav opposes the demand to oust 
Sharon 
from the Likud. MK Qatzav told our correspondent Hayim Hecht 
that he supports Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu, but proposes 
to him to establish a joint leadership made up of figures such 
as Ari'el Sharon and David Levi. 
  Likud secretariat chairman Yehoshu'a Matza said that through 
his announcement Sharon had ousted himself from the Likud's 
ranks. According to Matza, Sharon sows dissent and because of 
him the Likud was forced out of power. 
  MK Dan Meridor said Sharon's action was a grave mistake. The 
Likud has procedures, he said, and there can be no constant 
rivalry. 
  Moledet leader Rehav'am Ze'evi said that in order to save 
Eretz Yisra'el from the PLO's claws the national camp must 
present one candidate only: the man elected by the Likud. MK 
Ze'evi called on Sharon to put aside his personal ambition for 
the sake of Eretz Yisra'el, seeing that he has no chances of 
winning and that only the left-wing will profit by the split in 
the right-wing camp. 
  National Religious Party leader Zvulun Hammer said the 
squabbling in the Likud has the left-wing camp gloating this 
morning. Every possible effort must be made to attain a 
dialogue within the nationalist camp, he added. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0700 GMT on 27 May 
adds: 
"Minister 'Uzi Bar'am said that to date the Likud had only one 
candidate unfit to be prime minister, and that from now Likud 
voters will have two of them. 
  ["Minister Ya'ir Tzaban said that one must not forget that 
12 
years ago Sharon led the country to the Lebanon war, and that we 
paid a high price for this adventure."]

<F P=106> [Report by 'Amiram Kohen] </F>
  [Text] "If the salinization and pollution of the coastal 
aquifer continues at the present rate, the level of water 
salinity and pollution will by the year 2018 be such as to 
render 25 percent of the aquifer water impotable, while the 
salinity rate of over 50 percent of the water will be above the 
maximum recommended level." This is one of the findings of a 
report prepared by the Water Commission's Hydrological Service, 
due to be submitted to the Knesset's State Audit Committee today. 
  The coastal aquifer is Israel's largest reservoir containing 
about 400 million cubic meters of water -- about one-fifth of 
the entire water quantity produced annually in Israel. In 
recent years, annual pumping from that reservoir stood at some 
360 million cubic meters. The anticipated deterioration is the 
result of a rising nitrates concentration and from the 
salinization rate. 
  The report indicates that the coastal aquifer has been 
undergoing gradual salinization, and even today, about one-tenth 
of the water pumped from the reservoir (about 32 million cubic 
meters) comes from drillings ("cells") whose salinity rate 
exceeds 250 milligrams of chlorine to a liter, which is the 
maximum recommended by official standards. 
  The coastal aquifer's rate of increase of nitrates 
concentration is about one milligram to a liter per year. Any 
nitrate concentration exceeding 90 milligrams to a liter 
disqualifies the water immediately, because it causes cyanosis 
in babies. 
  The report shows that even today, about one-fifth of the 
entire quantity of water pumped from the aquifer (about 64 
million cubic meters) is produced from wells whose water has a 
nitrates concentration above the allowable norm, while about 60 
percent of the water is pumped from drillings which have 
exceeded the recommended maximum of 45 milligrams per liter. 
  The report notes that the pollution rate is liable to be 
much 
more rapid because the estimates do not account for future 
changes in groundwater quality.

  [Text] Water Commissioner Gid'on Tzur says that autonomy 
agreements could critically endanger Israel's water supply. In 
a briefing to the Knesset State Audit Committee, the 
commissioner said the country's water supply could be damaged by 
seeping sewage and industrial waste from the autonomous regions. 
He said he believes that Israel should have secured better 
guarantees for its water rights during negotiations.

agreement that transfers responsibility for water resources from 
Israel would require the approval of at least 80 MK's. MK

  [Text] The government today approved the joint Housing 
Ministry and Treasury plan to lower the cost of housing. This 
was after Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer decided not to 
present his proposal for allocating contractors 51 percent of 
the land freed in return for building apartments for candidates 
eligible for mortgages. The government will meet again on 
Wednesday to discuss Ben-Eli'ezer's proposal. This is aimed at 
ensuring that contractors winning tenders allocate 25 percent of 
the land for apartments to those who have the right to Housing 
Ministry support. Harley Braidman reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Braidman] The government approved the 
joint Housing Ministry and Treasury plan of minimum state 
intervention in construction. The main point of the program is 
an article relating to the marketing of land. The Israel Land 
Administration and the Housing Ministry presented a clear 
detailed plan for marketing 50,000 units annually in the center 
of the country. Contracts will tie down builders to fixed dates 
for start and completion of construction to prevent them 
stocking up on plots. Finance Minister Avraham Shohat was 
pleased with the government's decision. 
  [Shohat] We think that we decided about the proper things to 
do, and I believe that in order to carry out a massive building 
program we are creating the proper environment to the market to 
start building. I believe that we made a proper decision. The 
main thing is that we got clear information about the amount of 
plots that are going to be sold on the market in order to build 
houses and this is quite a big number of 50,000 in 1994 and 
50,000 in 1995. I think that will reduce the cost of the 
apartments. 
  [Braidman] In addition to the 25,000 foreigners allowed in, 
the government approved 13,000 workers from the territories to 
return to construction in Israel. Planning procedures will be 
simplified and infrastructure work speeded up. The government 
will not return to budgetary purchase of flats nor promise to 
buy apartments in demand areas. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] The Palestinian President Mr. Yasir 'Arafat 
arrived in the capital this evening on a visit to our country. 
[passage omitted] 
  After listening to the Palestinian and Mauritanian national 
anthems and reviewing a unit from the armed forces which 
performed a salute of honor, President 'Arafat greeted the 
people who welcomed him before going to the VIP lounge where he 
answered the questions of the national press. 
  Colleague (Mounha Bint Sbiaa) from the national TV asked him 
about the goal of the visit and the Palestinian president 
replied: I am not asked when I come to my second country; I am 
here with my brother and the beloved of our people the 
president, for whom we have all friendship and love. In 
reality, before my visit to the homeland soon, God willing, it 
is my duty to come to greet his excellency the president and 
thank him for this continuous and permanent support which we 
have received from the Mauritanian president, government, and 
people at all levels and at every meeting. [passage omitted] 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] According to 
what we have announced and as you mentioned, we can say that 
your present visit is a farewell one to his excellency the 
president before your blessed journey to Jericho, God willing. 
What are the certain guarantees which we can talk about in the 
future when we mention the implementation of self-rule in Gaza 
and Jericho first as being an effective start for the full 
Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories and 
consequently for the setting up of a free independent 
Palestinian state on this land? 
  ['Arafat] The sole guarantee is our people and the sole 
guarantee is our Arab brothers who stand by us and the sole 
guarantee is our friends in the world who stand by us. It is 
known that we only get things with difficulty and it is no 
coincidence that we have been negotiating for more than two and 
a half years and what for, for a transitional period and we are 
still negotiating with our Arab brothers and despite that, we 
have not been able to reach that, and there are still 
negotiations on the Syrian track, and on the Palestinian track 
which will continue, and there are also negotiations on the 
Lebanese and Jordanian tracks until we are able to reach a just 
and comprehensive solution on all the Arab tracks and not only 
on the Jordanian, Palestinian, Syrian, or Lebanese tracks 
[sentence as heard]. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] The Saudi ambassador in London admitted the 
failure of Saudi authorities to provide the necessary services 
to the pilgrims during this year's pilgrimage season, a matter 
which led to the death of a large number of them. The 
ambassador informed English radio that the number of pilgrims 
who died this year reached 829 people. 
  The JANA Islamic affairs editor commented on the Saudi 
ambassador's statements by saying: 
  It seems that Saudi Arabia is incapable of fully carrying 
out 
its duties toward the pilgrims who come to it each year from all 
over the world. This has become clear this year, when a large 
number of pilgrims have died, a matter that has been confirmed 
by numerous observers who travelled to the place in question. 
  The editor said that what happened to the pilgrims this year 
makes it incumbent on the Islamic countries to bear their 
responsibilities in securing the safety of the pilgrims to the 
holy Kaaba and carry out their duties in full toward this issue 
that concern all Muslims, and not only Saudi Arabia. [passage 
omitted] 
  The Islamic affairs editor concluded his comment by saying: 
What the Saudi ambassador has said raises a logical question: If 
Saudi Arabia was incapable of dealing with the situation of 
defending itself, how could it offer its services to the other 
Gulf countries in connection with offering protection to these 
countries in the face of foreign dangers, as it called them?

  [Text] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has said 
the opposition should fulfill its constitutional obligation for 
which they have been elected. Talking to newsmen in Islamabad 
today, she ruled out the possibility of resignation by the 
opposition, saying they are not going to do so as it is an empty 
threat. The prime minister said if the members of the 
opposition resign, under the constitution, by-elections will be 
held for the vacant seats. Ms. Benazir Bhutto said most of the 
72 members of the opposition do not believe in the agitational 
politics of the leader of the opposition. The prime minister 
said the people have elected us to end price hike and 
unemployment. She said the government has started various 
projects for the uplift of the people and to bring about social 
revolution in the country. She held the former prime minister, 
Mr. Nawaz Sharif, responsible for the economic crisis facing the 
country. She said Mr. Nawaz Sharif set a record in obtaining 
foreign loan. 
  The prime minister said this year's budget will be tough 
because of the negative economic policies pursued by the 
previous government. She said the present government, instead 
of providing ad hoc solutions to the problems confronting the 
country, is making all-out efforts to ensure a brighter economic 
future by finding permanent solutions. The government will have 
to levy taxes in order to bring down the deficit, she added. 
She said the budget has to be tough because of four factors 
inherited by the government. There was no increase in the salary 
of employees during the tenure of the previous regime. Hence 
this government has to do so which will result into an extra 
burden on the national exchequer. 
  The Nawaz government, she added, had taken hefty loans which 
put additional burden to the tune of 15 billion rupees on the 
national exchequer. PPP's [Pakistan People's Party's] last 
government, she said, had brought the deficit to 6 percent which 
went up to 8 percent during Mr. Nawaz Sharif's regime. There 
was no work on the Hab power project during the Nawaz regime 
which resulted into acute shortage of electricity. Instead, a 
Yellow Cab Scheme was launched which gave taxis to 60,000 
people. The national economy would be strong only when there 
would be a balance between the income and expenses which is not 
there now.

  [Text] The budget session of the National Assembly began 
at the Parliament House in Islamabad today. The speaker, Syed 
Yusuf Raza Gilani, is chairing the session. The opposition, 
ending their boycott of the National Assembly, participated in 
the proceedings of the house today. Speaking during question 
hour, the prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, said strict action 
will be taken against those responsible for the fire incident in 
the parliament building. She said her government believes in 
the rule of law and nobody is above the law. Committees and 
commissions were formed in the past, but no action was taken. 
The prime minister said the present government has launched a 
moral crusade and nobody will be spared. 
  The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has welcomed the 
opposition's decision to end the boycott of the National 
Assembly and described it as a positive step. Talking to 
newsmen at the Parliament House in Islamabad this afternoon, Ms. 
Benazir Bhutto said she had advised the opposition two days 
earlier to end their boycott and fulfill their constitutional 
responsibilities as elected representatives. She said she would 
also respond positively and invite the opposition leader and 
leaders of other political parties for discussions on economic 
issues over a cup of tea. 
  Replying to a question regarding her challenge to the 
opposition for submitting their resignations, the prime minister 
said she was confident that they would not submit their 
resignations to the speaker of the National Assembly. It was 
her assessment as a political leader. She said after last 
year's just and fair election, the politics of resignations has 
come to an end. Those who are elected do not resign. 
  To a question about the Sindh situation, Ms. Benazir Bhutto 
said the situation in the rural and urban areas of the province 
is serious for internal and external reasons. External forces 
have trained youths in the interior of Sindh as well in the 
cities for the purpose of terrorist activities and have provided 
them arms. In the past, only administrative steps had been 
taken to face the situation. We have decided to tackle the 
issue politically. She said her government, which is the 
people's government, is going to take long-term and short-term 
steps to resolve the problems faced by the people of Karachi. 
These include provision of drinking water, more electricity, 
transport and hospitals.

  [Text] The National Economic Council, which met in 
Islamabad today, approved the eighth five-year plan to the tune 
of 1,701 billion rupees. Presided over by the prime minister, 
Ms. Benazir Bhutto, the meeting was also attended by the chief 
ministers of the four provinces. 
  The eighth five-year plan is 48 percent larger than the 
seventh five-year plan. The plan envisages 7 percent growth 
rate of GDP and 60 percent contribution from the private sector. 
The unemployment rate will be reduced from 8 percent to 6 
percent by the year 1998 by creating 6.2 million new jobs during 
the five-year plan. 
  The meeting also approved the annual development plan for 
the 
year 1994-95 and the public sector development program. The 
meeting stressed the need of legislative control over the 
budgetary deficit so that the executive should have to go back 
to the legislature on every spending over and above the 
budgetary allocation.

  [Text] New York, 28 May (INA)--Iraq has protested the 
continued violations of Iraqi airspace by a U.S. U-2 spy plane 
on the pretext of conducting air surveys for the Special 
Commission. 
  In a message to UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus-Ghali from 
Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf, Iraq stressed that 
this plane, having flown from its base in Saudi Arabia, violated 
Iraqi airspace on 25 April and 11 and 24 May. After overflying 
vast areas of the country, it flew back to Saudi territory. 
  The message restates that this plane is used for purposes 
other than those specified by the UN Security Council and that 
its activity harms Iraq's sovereignty and security.

  [Excerpt] Irbil -- Regrettably, sporadic armed clashes took 
place in some quarters in Irbil on the evening of Sunday, 29 May 
1994. As a result of these clashes, a number of people from 
both parties [the Kurdistan Democratic Party, KDP, and the 
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, PUK] were killed or wounded, some 
houses were damaged, and wheat fields in the northern and 
eastern quarters of Irbil were set ablaze, inflicting huge 
losses on the owners of these fields. 
  The leadership of both parties, the KDP and PUK, issued a 
joint statement in which they called for an immediate 
cease-fire. The events were contained thanks to the 
intervention and efforts exerted by all parties, including the 
Operation Room and the joint security committee in Irbil.

  [Text] Ankara, May 30 (AFP) -- Rival Iraqi Kurdish factions 
met in Silopi, southeast Turkey, on Monday [30 May] but failed 
to agree on an end to their month-long clashes in northern Iraq, 
Kurdish sources said. 
  Officials from the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and 
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) emerged from the meeting near 
the Iraqi border, organised by Turkey, without making any 
comment to journalists. 
  But Kurdish sources said the officials failed to make any 
progress in efforts to halt the fighting which has claimed more 
than 100 lives since the start of May and split northern Iraq 
into PUK and KDP-controlled zones. 
  Tehran Radio said Monday that thousands of Kurds had fled 
their homes amid renewed fighting in Qal'at Dizah, 
al-Sulaymaniyah, the Hajj 'Umran region of Halabjah, near the 
Iranian border, and in Irbil. 
  Northern Iraq has been under Kurdish control since it was 
established with the help of the U.S.-led coalition which drove 
Iraqi occupying forces out of Kuwait in February 1991.

<F P=106> [Report by Huda al-Husayni from London] </F>
  [Text] Mas'ud Barzani, leader of the Democratic Party of 
Kurdistan [DPK], has told Radio Monte Carlo that the fighting 
between his party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK] 
under Jalal Talabani is the result of the differences in 
viewpoints on how to tackle matters, particularly how to run 
Iraqi Kurdistan and settle political issues. 
  Barzani said that Talabani's forces occupied the Parliament 
building on 3 May as coupists usually do as the first step. 
Barzani denied reports that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard are 
fighting on the side of his forces. He also denied that he has 
asked for Iran's mediation. He said that it was Talabani who 
asked Tehran to host a meeting of the leaders of the warring 
Iraqi Kurdish parties. 
  Mas'ud Barzani also stressed that no one in Iraqi Kurdistan 
has prevented Talabani, who is in Damascus, from returning to 
his headquarters, and that on his request the allied forces 
military coordination office placed a helicopter at his disposal 
to bring him to Kurdistan. However, Talabani changed his mind. 
  Barzani accused the PUK forces of killing all civilian and 
military prisoners who belong to the DPK. 
  In his interview with Radio Monte Carlo, Mas'ud Barzani 
admitted that the fighting has weakened the democratic process 
in Kurdistan and has not enhanced the status of Iraqi Kurds in 
the eyes of the western countries. On the contrary, the 
fighting has embarrassed some of these countries. He emphasized 
the need to stop the fighting.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] The terrorist group, the so-called Islamic 
Movement, thought that through the use of weapons it could 
generally obstruct the liberation march of our Kurdish people, 
and in particular, harm the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and 
isolate it from its masses. In order to implement its 
aggressive plan against the just aims and aspirations of our 
people, this terrorist group, the so-called Islamic Movement, a 
few months ago resorted to the policy of creating crises and 
establishing the necessary grounds and atmosphere for wicked 
plots and plans against our people, which they prepared outside 
Kurdistan. But it was the Almighty's will that the true face of 
this terrorist group be exposed to our Kurdish people. This 
group did not value the lives of the people of Kurdistan. It 
directed its guns against the innocent people in 
al-Sulaymaniyah, Irbil, Raniyah, Halabjah, Klar, and other 
Kurdistani cities. 
  In view of this foolish action, the forces of the Patriotic 
Union of Kurdistan, in cooperation with the angry people, chased 
the members of the Islamic Movement and drove them out of 
Kurdistan. The crimes committed by the fighters of this 
so-called Islamic Movement are in flagrant violation of the 
principles of human rights which Islam has strongly defended. 
What we regret are not the actions of this group, but we are 
sorry to see a country like the Islamic Republic of Iran 
supporting such a terrorist group and directing it to kill the 
children, women, and old people of Kurdistan. Kurdistan has 
always looked to the Islamic Republic for assistance and support 
and expected it to treat Kurdistan at least as it treated the 
Muslims of Bosnia and not to interfere in its internal affairs. 
Kurdistan never expected it to go against the will of its 
people through a terrorist group which was rejected by the 
masses of Kurdistan long before it started its wicked plots and 
plans. This terrorist group has proved its failure and 
inability to find any popular base in Iraqi Kurdistan and 
inability to win the sympathy and support of the people. The 
aims of any political party rejected by the masses are doomed to 
failure, because the attitude of the masses is the proper 
criteria for the suitability of any political party. 
  Our Kurdish people in Iraqi Kurdistan thought that the 
success of the Islamic revolution in Iran and the defeat of the 
oppressive Shah regime would be good for them, because they 
believed that the Islamic Republic, having has ended an 
oppressive regime like that of the Shah, could not stand against 
the will of oppressed peoples who yearn for freedom. We thought 
defense of the oppressed people was one of the important 
principles the Islamic Republic of Iran believes in, and our 
Kurdish people in Iraqi Kurdistan is one of the leading 
oppressed nations in the area which deserve support and 
assistance. Any military action against our Kurdish people is 
tantamount to siding with Saddam Husayn and his dictatorial 
regime against the aspirations, desires, and aims of the Iraqi 
Arab and Kurdish people, the Iranian people, and all the peoples 
in the area.

  [Text] Cairo, 30 May (INA) -- Foreign Minister Muhammad 
Sa'id al-Sahhaf, the head of Iraq's delegation to the 
Non-Aligned conference met with Norodom Sira, the foreign 
minister of Vietnam [name and title as received] here today. 
  Mr. al-Sahhaf indicated to the Vietnamese minister a shift 
favoring Iraq in the UN Security Council. He also noted that 
more permanent and nonpermanent members of the council, as well 
as the international community, are demanding an end to the 
sanctions. Al-Sahhaf further noted that Iraq was complying with 
the obligations stipulated in Security Council resolutions. 
  Al-Sahhaf impressed on the Vietnamese minister the need for 
the Council to honor its obligations to Iraq. He hoped that 
when the council next reviews Iraq's compliance with the 
Security Council resolutions, it will take a fair and clear-cut 
stand leading to the lifting of the sanctions. The two 
ministers also talked about relations between Iraq and Vietnam. 
  The IRAQI NEWS AGENCY correspondent in Cairo reports that 
the 
Vietnamese minister renewed his country's support for removing 
the sanctions as a matter of urgency. The Vietnamese Government 
and people, he said, view Iraq's performance under more than 
three years of the sanctions with pride and admiration. 
  The two ministers also reviewed the agenda of the 
Non-Aligned 
conference, which opens tomorrow, both agreeing on the need for 
the movement to be strengthened and its principles upheld. 
  Iraq's permanent Arab League delegate attended the session.

  [Text] Cairo, 1 Jun (INA) -- Foreign Minister Muhammad 
Sa'id al-Sahhaf, head of the Iraqi delegation to the meetings of 
the Nonaligned Movement [NAM], met here today with Yemeni 
Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah. 
  Basindwah explained to al-Sahhaf the plots being hatched 
against Yemen's unity with the aim of undermining the people's 
achievements. 
  The Yemeni minister stressed his country's rejection of any 
interference in its domestic affairs by any party because what 
is happening in Yemen is an internal affair and because the 
legitimate authority and the people are determined to preserve 
unity and to side with the constitutional government to foil the 
objectives of the separatists. 
  For his part, Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf reiterated Iraq's 
firm 
position in support of the legitimate government in fraternal 
Yemen and preserving its unity. 
  During the meeting, they also discussed the current Arab 
situation, ways of enhancing joint Arab action, and the items on 
the agenda of the nonaligned meeting in Cairo. 
  The meeting was attended by Dr. Nabil Najm, Iraq's permanent 
envoy to the Arab League.

  [Text] Ivan Rybkin, the chairman of the Russian Duma -- the 
Russian parliament -- received at the parliament in Moscow 
yesterday the Iraqi ambassador to the Russian Federation. 
  At the outset, the ambassador expressed Iraq's gratitude for 
Russia's recent position at the Security Council and its demand 
that the blockade be lifted, stressing the need to develop this 
position to lift the unjust blockade on Iraq. He noted that 
Iraq has implemented all Security Council resolutions. 
  The Iraqi ambassador briefed Rybkin on the situation in Iraq 
and what Iraq has done to implement Security Council 
resolutions, stressing the need for the Security Council to 
fulfill its own obligations, lift the blockade, and end the 
suffering of the Iraqi people. 
  The Iraqi ambassador also handed the chairman of the Russian 
parliament a detailed memorandum on the social and economic 
effects of the blockade on the life of the Iraqi citizens after 
four years of its enforcement. He explained how this is 
affecting their health situation, noting the large increase in 
the mortality rate of children and the elderly. He also said 
that the blockade has had adverse effects on many countries, 
primarily Russia, and that these countries have incurred great 
losses as a result of the blockade. 
  For his part, Ivan Rybkin stressed that the Russian 
Federation and the parliament are ready to use all means to lift 
the unjust blockade and take part in international and 
parliamentary conferences to lift the blockade and end the 
suffering of the Iraqi people. 
  He also expressed his happiness and desire to host a 
delegation from the Iraqi National Assembly, led by Sa'di Mahdi 
Salih, the assembly speaker, to discuss relations and ways of 
enhancing them between the two friendly countries and peoples.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] There has been a new episode in the continuing 
farces of Baghdad rulers: Saddam Husayn fired Prime Minister 
Ahmad Husayn and his government. In a dictatorial decree, he 
appointed himself prime minister. Through this ploy, Saddam is 
trying to blame Ahmad Husayn and his ministers for the 
suffocating economic and social crises from which the Iraqi 
masses are suffering. 
  But this farce means nothing to the Iraqi citizens; it can 
never mislead the Iraqi people. As president, Saddam Husayn has 
failed to find any solution to the problems of the Iraqis, 
problems caused by his own wrong policies. How then can he, as 
prime minister, save the Iraqis from their tragedies and 
ordeals? Apart from this, the Iraqi citizen knows full well 
that Saddam Husayn is the source of all power in Iraq: the 
legislative, executive, and judicial. No power in Iraq can 
implement a law, make a decision, or pass a ruling without 
Saddam's approval. The law of force prevails in Iraq, and 
Saddam is its source. 
  If Saddam enjoys absolute power to do whatever he wants--or, 
indeed, if he is the sole source of power--then why did he want 
to take the premiership for himself? Is it because Saddam 
Husayn has a brain capable of saving the Iraqis from the plights 
and tragedies that he himself created? We believe that there 
are many reasons behind Saddam's decision to take the prime 
ministry for himself. These reasons, we believe, have nothing to 
do with the failure of this or that ministerial group to address 
the economic situation. These reasons include the following: 
  1. The lack of confidence between Saddam Husayn and his 
closest allies in the government. 
  2. The desire not to allow any government or party official 
to remain in a post through which he may [words indistinct]. In 
this context, we can mention Sa'dun Hammadi, Muhammad Hamzah 
al-Zubaydi, and Ahmad Husayn. They all served as prime 
ministers but were sacked by Saddam Husayn within less than four 
years. 
  3. An attempt to delude the Iraqi people into thinking that 
Saddam Husayn is not the sole reason behind the deterioration of 
the economic and social conditions in Iraq. 
  4. The blunder and [word indistinct] in the top ranks of 
authority and the need to remove from power the regime officials 
who are not from the ruling family. This is probably the 
strongest of all the reasons. Here, we must recall the 
accusations leveled by 'Udayy Saddam Husayn against the regime's 
ministers, ambassadors, and diplomats in one of his articles in 
BABIL in March. The article was full of criticism injected with 
threats against the ministers. 'Udayy accused the ministers and 
the diplomats of negligence and incompetence. He branded the 
ambassadors as brokers and traders in carpets and female 
journalists. He underestimated the standing of people in most 
of the regime's ministries. That (?article) was the first step 
in removing many regime figures whom Saddam did not like to see 
in power. At that time, we explained 'Udayy's threats as the 
first step in a plan to remove many officials from sensitive 
posts in the regime's institutions to allow the ruling family to 
interfere in the most minute details in the life of the Iraqi 
citizen. 
  Surely, if things continue like this, the regime's Council 
of 
Ministers, the Revolution Command Council, and all important 
posts will be distributed among Saddam Husayn's relatives and 
henchmen. At any rate, we think that this move is too late. 
Saddam's attempts to save the dictatorial regime from collapse 
are doomed. They will not negate the fact that the regime has 
been turned into a defective body moaning under the yoke of its 
deep wounds and drawing its last breath.

  [Text] Early this morning, leader President Saddam Husayn, 
may God protect him, inspected the al-Rashid fruit and vegetable 
market in the al-Dawrah area in Baghdad. To examine the prices 
of agricultural products and the reasons for their rise in 
price, his excellency held detailed discussions with those in 
charge of marketing offices. In an objective and candid 
dialogue, those concerned reviewed their ideas and experiments 
in this field. 
  The leader president listened to their observations, views, 
and proposals for curbing the high prices of fruit and 
vegetables and for easing their adverse effect on citizens' 
lives. His excellency said that the extent of price hikes is 
unjustified, and that marketing outlets can play a fair and 
national role at this period in time when the children of our 
proud people are suffering from the effects of the unjust 
blockade. He said that marketing outlets should be satisfied 
with a profit margin that pleases God and all parties, and 
contributes to achieving contentment, psychological stability, 
and reassurance on all levels. He said that profits should be 
within reasonable limits, and not at the expense of others' 
misery and suffering and [word indistinct] calculations. He 
said when the citizen deals with others, he should take into 
consideration the calculations of the society as an entity with 
common sentiments and fate. This is because, he added, high 
prices harm the citizen and expands to harm the entire society, 
God forbid. 
  His excellency stressed that the blockade will founder, God 
willing, against the Iraqis' firm patience and steadfastness 
which has drawn worldwide admiration. 
  Meanwhile, leader President Saddam Husayn, may God protect 
him, greeted the children of our people, who shouted "long live 
the president." They stressed absolute confidence in his 
excellency's leadership of the march of jihad and construction 
and defense of glorious and steadfast Iraq, the Iraq of beloved 
leader Saddam Husayn.

  [Text] Chairing the first session of the cabinet, His 
Excellency President Saddam Husayn has ordered that the fees of 
monitors at general examination centers be raised to 50 dinars 
per day. This was disclosed by Minister of Education Hikmat 
'Abdallah al-Bazzaz to the Iraqi News Agency. This generous act 
on the part of his excellency the leader president, al-Bazzaz 
said, is another addition to his numerous such favors in support 
of a superior educational process. The move doubles the 
educationists' responsibility to carry out their monitoring 
duties in the test centers so as to raise a generation armed 
with science and faith. 
  In the name of the teaching profession, the minister 
promised His Excellency leader, mujahid President Saddam Husayn 
that efforts will be maximized to enhance the scientific and 
educational standard and quicken the pace of the march of 
advancement Iraq is experiencing in all domains.

<F P=106> ["Sidelines" column by Sabri Hammadi: "More on the Internal </F>
Blockade"] 
  [Text] In any talk about the blockade, it is essential to 
make a distinction between two types of blockades. The first 
type is the one being imposed on us by the evil enemies, which 
is still continuing due to a declared U.S. decision. The second 
type is an internal blockade being imposed on us by a handful of 
brazen, capricious, and parasitic retailers and illegal 
profiteers. Four years of external blockade have proven beyond 
any doubt that we can resist this type of blockade and confront 
it with more patience, unity, and creative, productive work. We 
have rejected every morsel, no matter how tasty, that has been 
dipped in the poison of humiliation and degradation. In fact, 
we have proven that we are stronger than the plan of starvation, 
impoverishment, and blockade despite its pressure and harshness. 
  Since the pressure of the internal blockade is greater than 
that of the external blockade, we call for government 
intervention to protect us from these savage beasts that keep 
gnawing at our flesh, sucking our blood, and breaking our bones 
without so much as a batted eyelid or feeling any sense of 
remorse over national patriotism and responsibility. 
  We are not being unfair to these illegal profiteers when we 
say that what they are doing complements the feverish 
U.S.-Zionist efforts against the freedom, dignity, unity, and 
will power of our people. It is sufficient to see the clear 
harmony between the hike in local prices and the reports being 
broadcast by the Voice of America and the BBC on the blockade. 
  I cannot claim that I have an idea about the measures that 
should be taken by the government to protect the people from 
these greedy merchants, but it has become essential and urgent 
for the government to intervene in order to deter these 
merchants and put an end to their activities. We do not doubt 
for one single moment that its intervention will be the best 
means to block enemy wagers and evil designs.

  [Text] [Announcer] At the end of their visit to Algeria 
yesterday, the European troika stressed their support for the 
economic reforms currently under way and the progress of the 
dialogue between the Algerian government and the opposition, 
with the exception of the parties involved in violence, to 
overcome the political crisis. Colleague Bechir Hedebil has 
prepared the following report on the visit and its results. 
  [Hedebil] The Greek foreign minister stressed that the 
troika 
delegation came to Algeria with a message of support from the 
European Union [EU] for the Algerian economic plan and national 
dialogue. 
  George Papandreou described the talks between the European 
delegation and Algerian officials, led by [President] Liamine 
Zeroual as serious and frank. 
  In the economic sphere, the European delegation expressed 
its 
deep satisfaction at the economic plan and the government's 
concern about economic reforms. The Algerian Government 
delegation, led by [Prime Minister] Mokdad Sifi, was reassured 
about the EU's support for Algeria in its negotiations with 
international financial institutions. Papandreou said: 
  [Papandreou, in English with superimposed Arabic 
translation] 
In the discussions we also talked about the recent signing 
of the agreement with the IMF and we expressed our support for 
Algeria because that agreement is regarded as a solid basis 
which demonstrates and proves the Algerian Government's 
determination to continue the economic reforms. We have 
expressed our support for these serious efforts. 
  We also discussed constructive proposals for 
cooperation between Algeria and the EU. We made proposals on 
support and help for these efforts to achieve the government's 
plan. 
  [Hedebil] Regarding assistance or financial support, 
Papandreou said: 
  [Papandreou] We have announced to the Algerian 
Government that 150 million ECU's, which is the second 
installment of a loan, will be paid to Algeria soon. Regarding 
the proposal and request for a new loan of 200 million ECU's, we 
have replied affirmatively to the Algerian request in order to 
consolidate the economic stabilization plan. The request will 
be submitted officially to the European Commission and the 
European Council of Ministers in forthcoming sessions. 
  A delegation of European experts will visit Algeria to 
hold in-depth talks with Algerian counterparts to discuss joint 
action to consolidate and implement the economic plan. 
  [Hedebil] Papandreou concluded by saying that Algeria 
possessed enormous resources and had a very important future, 
and that the EU supported its plan and would make every effort 
to achieve the reforms by developing a partnership. 
  In the political sphere, the Greek minister stressed the 
need 
to support the democratic process: 
  [Papandreou] Again let me stress as we have during our 
discussions that the European Union favors, supports and backs 
democratic governments, wherever they may be, which respect 
human rights, aspire to economic stability and the realization 
of reforms, including social reforms, and strongly condemns the 
use of violence and terrorism. 
  The Algerian minister of foreign affairs, Mohamed Salah 
Dembri, focussed on the European delegation's understanding of 
the difficult situation in Algeria and the pressing need for 
supporting it financially in order to achieve economic and 
political stability in the country. 
  [Hedebil] He said that Algeria was determined to achieve 
market economy, had a deep desire to have economic dealings with 
the EU and that it had put an end to the old economic obstacles.

  [Text] The services of the Communication Ministry today 
issued an explanation on the article that was published by the 
daily AL-WATAN entitled: The Presidency: A New Structure Under 
Examination. 
  The Communication Ministry's statement asserted that the 
issue here revolved around an article that epitomized and 
commented in a derisory manner on a topic that was classified 
top secret by the Defense Ministry. 
  Following the publication of such an article, the 
Communication Ministry service explanation added, the office of 
the communication minister summoned AL-WATAN editors, as well as 
the journalist who wrote the article for a meeting. They were 
asked to furnish the names of those who supplied them with the 
information in a bid to establish the source of the leak that 
was used to write the article that clearly violated the criminal 
code articles, as well as the information bill. 
  A collective statement was signed by two AL-WATAN editors 
and 
the journalist with their free will. The latter did, however, 
sign another statement individually. 
  The communication minister's statement points out that the 
unfounded claims, published in today's AL-WATAN editorial, has 
complicated the situation in the country because the highest 
body of the state was depicted as a normal administration. 
  The Communication Ministry statement concluded by saying 
that 
there was no doubt that necessary legal measures will be taken 
by the competent authorities against AL-WATAN.

  [Excerpts] President Hashemi-Rafsanjani, addressing the 
academic staff and students of Amir Qabir Industrial University 
today, stressed the need for better utilization of the 
university's resources to meet the country's industrial 
requirements. According to a Central News Unit report, the 
president today opened the new mining engineering and metallurgy 
department building at the university. [passage omitted] 
  Later, the president answered questions raised by the 
students and lecturers. We draw your attention to a report by 
our correspondent: 
  Speaking about relations with Saudi Arabia, the president 
said: We are in favor of cooperation with all Islamic countries, 
including Saudi Arabia, but we will not retreat from our rights. 
The president added: Saudi Arabia has created difficulties and 
obstacles for its neighbors, including Iraq, and it is not 
acceptable to us that a bigger country of the region is putting 
pressure on another country. Nevertheless, we are seeking ways 
to resolve the disputes between the two countries, but as yet we 
have not achieved any results. 
  Commenting on Iran's foreign debts, the president said: Our 
foreign debt is about $17 billion, $10 billion of which is 
scheduled to be repaid by $3 billion annually. He added: We 
have rescheduled repayment of our debts to foreign countries 
with an interest rate of less than five percent, and we hope 
that our country's problem will be solved by the year 2000. 
  Moving on to the readjustment of subsidy payments for 
essential goods, the president said: We are not planning to 
implement the plan for readjustment of subsidies without raising 
wages. 
  Speaking about the government's new decision on hard 
currency 
exchange rates, the president said: This decision was made 
after a series of experimental programs, and the objective is to 
create a balance between supply and demand. 
  Referring to the fact that the government is capable of 
meeting the country's real needs for hard currency, Mr. 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani expressed the hope that through cooperation 
with the private sector, the decision to ban the sale of hard 
currency to importers outside the state banking system would 
reach the desired objective. 
  The president denied rumors that Kish Island is to be given 
[vagozari] to Germany in return for Iran's debt to that country. 
He said: Iranian capital investment in Germany is more than the 
debt Iran owes to Germany. 
  In reply to a question as to whether foreign satellites 
would 
halt the export of the revolution, the president said: Our 
revolution is an ideological revolution corresponding to human 
nature, and has preserved its place among the world Muslims; 
this sort of problems will never be capable of undermining the 
export of our revolution. 
  The president described the campaign against narcotics in 
the 
country as very desirable and said: Even our foes confess to 
this fact.

  [Text] Tehran, May 31, IRNA -- President Akbar Hashemi 
Rafsanjani said here today that the government has planned to 
create a balance between the supply and demand process in the 
foreign exchange market. 
  Speaking to a group of students from the Amir Kabir 
Technical 
University, he said that all importers should obtain their 
foreign exchange from the banking network, and hoped that 
private sector would cooperate with the government on the new 
plan. 
  On the elimination of the subsidies, the president said the 
government tackled half of the problems regarding the subsidies 
in the First Five Year Plan, and that the issue would be totally 
settled during the Second Five Year Plan (to begin in 1995). 
  He said that the wages will rise parallel to the prices 
increase, and that the government will not eliminate the 
subsidies without increasing the wages. 
  On Iran's foreign debts, the president said the government 
could arrange installments on about 10 billion dollars of the 
foreign debts, i.e., paying back an annual three billion dollars 
up to the year 2000. "The debts will be paid back with an 
interest of less than five percent," he added. 
  Refuting the rumours on the disposal of the southern Kish 
Island to Germany in return for the debts, the president said 
there is nothing in the island to be disposed. "Fortunately 
Iran's debts to Germany have been rescheduled, and Germany owes 
Iran more than Iran does. [no ending quote as received] 
  The president explained that Germany demands nearly 7 
billion 
marks from Iran over the Bushehr Power Plant, while, it should 
pay compensations up to 7 billion to 8 billion dollars to Iran 
for leaving the project incomplete. 
  The case has been presented to the court, "and if the court 
is fair, it will vote in favour of Iran, and if Germany 
completes the project, 2,400 megawatt of electricity will be 
generated into the nationwide power network which is very 
valuable for the country." 
  On relations with the Saudi Arabia, he said there are some 
problems regarding the relations with Saudi Arabia including the 
hajj ceremonies. 
  At the same time, he said, Saudi Arabia makes troubles for 
its neighbours, namely Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar 
and Yemen. "Saudi pressures on the Iraqi people, its relations 
with the U.S. and some problems regarding the oil market are 
among other issues." 
  "We will not step back from our principles for the 
settlement of these problems" he stressed. 
  Asked about the satellite dishes, he said the satellite 
dishes do not contradict export of the cultural revolution. 
However, the president said the majlis (parliament) is working 
on a plan on banning the use of satellite dishes.

  [Text] Tehran, June 1, IRNA -- A morning daily here 
Wednesday [1 June] recommended the Iranian authorities to 
reconsider Tehran's relations with London and take a more 
calculated and deliberate stance vis-a-vis Britain. 
  Criticizing the recent British charges against Iran 
including 
the alleged Tehran's support for the Irish Republican Army (IRA) 
and the expelling of Iranian charge d'affaires from Britain, 
`JOMHURI-E ESLAMI' wrote in a commentary that the British 
officials have launched an "extensive propaganda campaign 
against the Islamic Repulic of Iran with an aim to satisfy 
American statesmen." 
  The article referred to the forthcoming visit to Britain of 
the U.S. President Bill Clinton, scheduled next Sunday, and said 
that the British mass media, by resorting to fabricated 
allegations, once again are trying to accuse Iran of having 
supported the IRA. 
  The British officials have created a smokey screen whenever 
they had failed in their foreign policy, said the article adding 
that the present propaganda ploy against Tehran comes in the 
aftermath of the last month disclosure of Britain's 
eavesdropping at the Iranian Embassy in London.

  [Text] On the basis of a circular issued by President 'Ali 
Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, anyone trying to smuggle foreign 
currency out of the country will be identified and handed over 
to the judicial authorities for punishment. 
  During a news conference today, Intelligence Minister 'Ali 
Akbar Fallahian said: Since implementation of the new policy on 
foreign currency, eight gangs involved in the illegal purchase, 
accumulation, and smuggling of hard currency abroad have been 
arrested and handed over to the judicial officials. 
  Referring to Iraqi provocations to create terror inside 
Iran, 
he said: During the past four months, the Iraqi Ba'thist 
regime, in pursuit of its particular objectives, has exported 
some sabotage gangs and has resorted to planting bombs in Iran, 
in particular. However, thanks to efforts of the intelligence 
forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran, two high-ranking Iraqi 
intelligence officers have been arrested inside our country. He 
added: These two intelligence officers, named Ra'd Mustafa 
Fattah and Arkan 'Abd al-Amir 'Ali, have confessed to their 
mission, including the import of explosives to Iran. 
  The intelligence minister pointed out: Four Iranians who 
have been cooperating with the Iraqi intelligence officers have 
been arrested and have confessed that they were involved in 
intelligence work. 
  Stressing that the Iraqi regime intends to depict our 
country 
as insecure by detonating bombs in Iran, Mr. Fallahian went on: 
During the past four months, 22 bombs have been imported into 
the country by Iraqi elements. In addition to the arrest of the 
above people, 14 bombs have been discovered. 
  About the latest investigations on the discovery of a 
microphone in our country's London Embassy, the intelligence 
minister said: The dimensions of this espionage affair are not 
limited to the discovery of a microphone alone, and we have not 
divulged all of the issues yet. A country's embassy is regarded 
as its territory in accordance with international regulations, 
and they have violated our sovereignty while the British press 
unanimously presents the issue as a normal occurrence. 
  Another issue mentioned by the intelligence minister was the 
return of the Iranians living abroad. He said: Iranians living 
abroad can take advantage of the facilities we have provided for 
them. 
  About the plot to assassinate the President on 1 February 
1994, marking the anniversary of Khomeyni's return to Iran, 
Intelligence Minister Fallahian said: Investigations on this 
matter are still continuing.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Anti-India Wisner"] </F>
  [Text] The views expressed by the designated U.S. envoy to 
India, Frank Wisner, before the Foreign Affairs Committee of the 
U.S. Senate about India were not answers to satisfy the 
requirements for his appointment, but are the anti-India views 
of Wisner. The India visit by U.S. Assistant Secretary for 
State, Strobe Talbott, and U.S. visit by Prime Minister Narsimha 
Rao had begun the process of normalizing relations. The job of 
any envoy is to further the interests of his nation, but it is 
also his job to try his utmost to strengthen bilateral 
relations. Wisner has not yet arrived in India, but he has 
already started showing his fangs. India is a sovereign nation 
and prudent enough to know what is good for it and what is bad. 
Wisner is trying to threaten India in a roundabout way 
regarding the Prithvi short-range missiles deployed by the Army. 
He is saying that deployment of these missiles would worsen the 
arms race. In a way, Wisner is representing the U.S. point of 
view about missiles, but it is also clear that he has highly 
prejudiced views about India. Only a few days ago, he expressed 
negative views about India becoming a permanent member of the 
Security Council. If he wanted, he could have supported India's 
nomination to the Security Council, arguing that India was the 
largest democratic country in the world. After all, India had 
supported China's permanent membership in the Seurity Council. 
It is not that U.S. diplomacy is always practiced on 
principles. Obviously, Wisner has orchestrated this anti-India 
refrain intentionally. 
  There is tremendous contradiction in Wisner's views. He 
admits that there is danger to India from China. If that danger 
is from China's atom bomb, then the same danger would threaten 
from its carrier missiles. Prithvi is also a short-range 
missile. India also should develop and deploy the Agni missile. 
It is unfortunate that launching the Prithvi, which was 
postponed in view of the U.S. tour by Rao, has been postponed 
again. India have no fear of the Wisners. Wisner is 
overlooking the fact that Pakistan not only has Chinese-made 
M-11 missiles, but F-16 U.S. fighter planes. Wisher favors 
supplying F-16's to Pakistan. Atom bombs could be dropped by 
these planes. Hence, is there no danger to India from Pakistan? 
On what logic is he recommending supply of F-16 fighter planes 
to Pakistan? It is obvious that Wisner is anti-India. The 
Indian Government shoudl object to his appontment. What would 
such an envoy with a poisoned tongue do in India? His arrogant 
statements would put daily dents in the relations which have 
normalized with great difficulty.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Deploying Prithvi"] </F>
  [Text] True to promise, US Ambassador-designate Frank 
Wisner has warned India against deploying the Prithvi missiles 
despite his lack of knowledge as to whether the weapon is 
configured to carry a nuclear warhead. The easy inference is 
that it is neither nuclear capability and a tested delivery 
system nor the violation of the arbitrary Missile Technology 
Control Regime (MTCR), the norms of which do not cover the 
Prithvi, which bothers Washington. What clearly does is India's 
demonstrable military superiority over Pakistan. All strategic 
experts have averred that the Prithvi does not really threaten 
China, for it cannot reach a significant target beyond the 
buffer territory of Tibet. So it must be concluded that the 
short-range missile may be deployed only to threaten Pakistan. 
The warning that Mr Wisner, a Pentagon policy expert, has issued 
is transparently aimed at assuring Pakistan whose President, Mr 
Farooq Leghari, is in Washington apparently to work out the 
details of a Pakistan agreement to cap its nuclear programme. 
The queer aspect of the episode is that Mr Wisner is 
consciously using the run-up before taking over as ambassador in 
New Delhi to create critics rather than friends. He must have 
the full assurance of the State Department that he would be none 
the worse for the handicap run. 
  The US opposition against the deployment of the Prithvi, 
first articulated by Senator [as published] Lee Hamilton before 
Mr Narasimha Rao set out for Washington and now by Mr Wisner 
when the Prime Minister is back in India makes it clear that 
this short-range missile is at the moment on top of the US 
agenda for India. This can create complications for Mr 
Narasimha Rao, who pledged in Parliament that the Prithvi would 
be user-tested after the few days postponement he ordered not to 
cause an irritation before his US visit. The expected date, May 
23, has passed off without the test. But the Army, defence 
scientists and district officials of Balasore in Orissa are all 
waiting in readiness, with the hope that the exercise will take 
place before May is out. Mr Rao may go ahead with the trial, 
because the Americans have not objected to this (the opposition 
is to the Prithvi's deployment). But suspicions about 
accommodating America's "friendly persuasions" will continue 
unless the Government makes a public announcement that it has 
actually deployed the missiles. The postponement of the Prithvi 
trial was probably seen by the US as capping the programme. 
What it perhaps expects now is a roll-back, which is exactly 
the opposite of the weapon's deployment. The Agni, being still 
an experiment, is the lesser evil of India's missile programme 
that the US wishes to curb. The myth of US arm-twisting will not 
be blasted by presenting an Indian arm intact. If there is need 
for complete transparency, it is in diplomatic exchanges between 
New Delhi and Washington. Even whispers would send out eloquent 
messages in a regime of quiet diplomacy.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Policy of Pressure"] </F>
  [Text] India should not react immediately to the statement 
by U.S. Ambassador-designate to India Frank Wisner about 
missiles and especially the Prithvi missile program. This is 
because his statement means that the United States has been 
interfering in the program and that it does not favor the 
development of Prithvi by India within the Indian army. The 
question here is whether the Indian defense program is dependent 
on the mercy, grace, or whims of the United States or has the 
Indian Government given the United States the right to interfere 
directly in the Indian defense program. It is definitely not 
justified for an individual who has been nominated as the U.S. 
envoy to India to comment about Prithvi missiles. Frank Wisner 
may not have even reached Delhi but his interference has already 
begun. When this gentleman arrives, God only knows what he will 
do. Of course, this can be gauged easily. It should not be 
forgotten here that the United States has been sending many such 
officials to India whose main objective has been to interfere in 
its internal affairs. India should not tolerate this at any 
cost. 
  It is unfortunate that the designated U.S. envoy to India, 
Frank Wisner, commented on the Indian missile program at a time 
when it looked as if Indo-U.S. ties were swiftly improving 
again. Such a statement by a senior U.S. diplomat immediately 
after Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's successful U.S. tour is 
astonishing. On the one hand, U.S. President Bill Clinton has 
openly declared that he did not want to interfere in any way in 
the defense affairs of India and that it is for the Indian 
Government to decide what was good or bad for its own defense. 
On the other hand, the way the man designated to become the 
U.S. envoy to India has been making comments about India's 
defense program smacks of a threat. Definitely, Wisner's 
comments have been made under a "policy of pressure," and the 
Indian Government must protest against this "policy of pressure." 
  As far as the missile program is concerned, Prime Minister 
Narasimha Rao has already given his assurances to Parliament. 
He also reiterated this when he was in the U.S., that there was 
no U.S. interference in the defense programs of India and that 
the United States has not adopted any policy of pressure. But 
the way Frank Wisner has decided to follow the path of the 
"policy of pressure," even before coming to India, is 
distressing. After all, both men cannot be right. Either the 
prime minister is right -- that there is no pressure from U.S. 
regarding the defense programs, especially in regard to Prithvi 
missiles, or Frank Wisner is, who plainly wants to put pressure 
on India that it should not deliver the Prithvi, developed by 
Indian scientists for the Indian army. At the moment, the only 
the question concerns Prithvi missiles being handed to the army. 
Yet, the United States has already started displaying a 
threatening posture. When Agni missiles are deployed, what 
would the attitude be then? The Agni missiles are 
unquestionably much more devastating and important than the 
Prithvi. Only the United States knows what its intentions are, 
but on the basis of what has appeared after Frank Wisner's 
remarks, one can safely say that the U.S. has not completely 
given up its policy of pressuring India. 
  The criticism of the main opposition parties cannot be 
termed 
as unjust in the least. CPIM's [Communist Party of India -- 
Marxist] reaction is quite right, that the United States wants 
to continue its policy of pressure. Like the CPIM, the BJP 
[Bharatiya Janata Party] has also criticized Frank Wisner's 
statement. Therefore, it would be justified for India to 
express its views on Wisner's comments and declare that the 
Prithvi and Agni missile programs would continue and the 
decision taken to deploy Prithvi with the Indian army would not 
be changed in any way.

<F P=106> [Report by unidentified "special correspondent"] </F>
  [Text] The military test of the surface-to-surface 
ballistic missile Prithvi will likely be held in the first week 
of June. Officials of the Defense Research and Development 
Organization and senior Army and Air Force officials are camping 
at Chandipur-on-the-Sea in Orissa for the test. According to 
reliable Defense Ministry sources, these officials in Chandipur 
are awaiting a green light from the Prime Minister's Office. 
  The test was scheduled for 13 May, but postponed in view of 
the prime minister's U.S. visit. Later, the authorities fixed 
23 May as the date, but this was not officially announced. As 
the Prithvi tests have not been held yet, speculation was rife 
that test flights were stopped due to U.S. pressure. Meanwhile, 
the U.S. ambassador-designate to India, Frank Wisner, in a 
statement on 26 May at the Senate confirmation hearing, 
indirectly warned India against deploying this missile. 
  Defense Ministry sources say that this round of tests will 
examine the Prithvi missile from different angles. The tests 
are expected to be completed by the end of July. After that, 
Bharat Dynamics will be given the go-ahead to start 
manufacturing the missile, although Defense Ministry sources are 
not in a position to state as to when the actual deployment of 
the missile will take place. During the main tests, scientists 
of the Defense Research and Development Organization and 
military experts will study the subsystems of the missile. This 
will include the command system and warhead capacity. 
  The defense sources say that the tests must begin before the 
monsoon reaches the east coast in about two weeks. The defense 
sources, however, are confident that they will complete this 
round of tests by July. During the first phase of deployment, 
the Army will deploy the missiles along the international border 
[with Pakistan] in Rajasthan and Punjab. The Army has already 
created a special artillery regiment for the purpose. Special 
bunkers are being constructed to deploy these missiles in the 
plains where they will be kept in specific controlled 
temperature conditions. 
  During the second phase of deployment, Prithvi will be 
deployed in Jammu and Kashmir, but the Defense Ministry sources 
are not stating when this deployment will commence. It is worth 
mentioning that Pakistan has already deployed 70-km range Hatf-1 
and 120-km range Hatf-2 missiles. It has also deployed 300-km 
range M-11 missiles which have been acquired from China. 
  India is deploying Prithvi missiles in response to the 
Pakistani-deployed missiles, but the United States has only 
indirectly warned India against the deployment of Prithvi 
missiles. This has led to widespread public interest on the 
deployment of these missiles. This has become a question of 
national pride. Almost all opposition parties have demanded that 
India strengthen its security by deploying these missiles.

  [Text] The prime minister has said funds for the 
indigenization program of the Indian Navy has been increased 
despite the reduction in the defense budget during the last few 
years. Mr. Narasimha Rao was speaking at the naval dockyard in 
Bombay today after commissioning the submarine INS [Indian Naval 
Ship] Shankul. The submarine has been built by the Mazagaon 
Docks Limited in collaboration with a German firm. Mr. Rao 
described the induction of INS Shankul -- the second 
indigenously built submarine -- as another landmark in maritime 
history of the country and its quest for self-reliance. The 
prime minister said the Indian Navy has been on the path of 
indigenization since the early 1980s and sustained, hard, and 
collaborative work has helped India reach the status of a 
submarine building nation. Mr. Rao said India's naval strength 
will essentially be for its self-defense and to protect its 
large offshore production assets -- fishing and exploitation of 
seabed resources -- in the exclusive economic zone. He said, we 
neither wish to control the ocean around us nor deny others 
their legitimate use or equitable access to the seas. 
  The chief of the Naval Staff, Admiral V.S. Shekhawat, 
accorded the acceptance of INS Shankul into the navy. The 
Maharashtra governor, Dr. P.C. Alexander, and the state chief 
minister, Mr. Sharad Pawar, were among those who attended the 
function.

  [Text] India is expected to receive thousands of defense 
spare parts and critically required ammunition from Russia and 
Ukraine within three months. Addressing the naval commanders 
conference in New Delhi today, the minister of state for 
defense, Mr. Mallikarjun, said this was successfully negotiated 
during the visit of a defense delegation to the countries early 
this month. He expressed concern at the increasing belligerency 
and weapons acquisition beyond its requirements by Pakistan. 
Referring to the low intensity conflict by Pakistan to 
destabilize India, the minister lauded the efforts of Navy and 
the Coast Guard in countering seaborne operations of subversive 
elements. He stressed the need for self-reliance and 
highlighted the necessity to undertake multi-institutional 
research to build all types of vessels and sophisticated 
warships.

  [Text] The Congress-I claims that the voter has put stamp 
of approval on the policies, programs and performance of the 
party in the just concluded by-elections. Talking to 
newspersons in New Delhi today, the party spokesman, Mr. V.N. 
Gadgil, said it is significant that five of the Lok Sabha 
constituencies, which Congress-I has won, are all rural 
constituencies and thus prove that rural people and farmers have 
rejected the opposition propaganda about Dunkel proposals. 
  Describing by-elections as trend setter, Mr. Gadgil, however 
ruled out the possibility of early general elections in the 
country.

  [Text] Cairo, 31 May (MENA) -- Syrian Foreign Minister 
Faruq al-Shar' has said that his country, like other Arab 
countries, is upset and hurt at the fighting between the 
brothers in Yemen. 
  He said in press statements today that all recent 
indications 
pointed to the fact that Yemen was on the brink of a dangerous 
situation. 
  He said: We believe that the use of wisdom and intelligence 
and concern over Yemeni unity should prompt the Yemeni leaders 
to stop the fighting immediately. 
  He noted that Syria was hoping the Arab countries would be 
able to resolve this problem, and urged the Yemeni brothers to 
preserve their unity. 
  The Syrian foreign minister said that the issue of fighting 
in Yemen is a hot issue and that many speakers touched on that 
matter today during the sessions of the Non-Aligned Movement's 
ministerial conference. It might also be discussed later during 
the conference. 
  He said that the brothers in Yemen, whether in the north or 
the south, want Syria, along with some other Arab brothers, to 
provide good offices. He pointed out that there is no Syrian 
initiative in this regard but Syria is working to stop the 
fraternal violence in Yemen. 
  On the resumption of the Middle East peace talks, especially 
on the Syrian-Israeli track, al-Shar' said that before Secretary 
Christopher returns to the region and we hear the response of 
the Israeli side to the Syrian ideas, which stressed that the 
beginnings of a new and serious peace process on the Syrian 
track depends on full Israeli withdrawal to the 4 June 1967 
lines, a new and united stand should be reached regarding 
resumption of negotiations in Washington. 
  Answering a question on the possibility of Syria accepting 
an 
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights over a period of three 
years, al-Shar' said: We will not talk about these details 
until after Israel agrees to the principle of full withdrawal. 
  To a questiion regarding announcements by the Israeli prime 
minister that Syria is not committed to peace, al-Shar' said: I 
believe he is talking about Israel and not Syria. Everyone 
knows that Syria is fully involved in peace. We have been 
saying this for the past two years and we have affirmed that the 
absence of progress in the Washington peace process goes back to 
the Israeli stalling in the negotiations.

  [Text] A concluding meeting was held at the Ba'th Party 
National Command building this morning between an Arab Socialist 
Ba'th Party delegation led by comrade 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, 
assistant secretary general of the party, and a CPC delegation 
led by comrade Wei Jianxing, member of the CPC Political Bureau 
and Central Committee Secretariat and head of the Chinese 
Federation of Trade Unions. The meeting was attended for the 
Ba'th Party by comrades Mut'ib Shinan, member of the Party's 
National Command, and 'Izz-al-Din Nasir, member of the Party's 
Regional Command and head of the General Federation of Trade 
Unions. 
  During the meeting, the two sides signed a cooperation 
program between the two parties for the next two years. They 
reviewed the results of the visit, which underscored the two 
parties' identical views on the most important issues and 
developments that concern the two parties. They stressed the 
need to take all necessary measures that will contribute to 
bolstering friendship between the two parties and peoples and 
promoting bilateral cooperation in the interest of the two 
countries. 
  Comrade al-Ahmar voiced his satisfaction with the outcome of 
the visit and its contribution to bolstering and developing 
friendship and cooperation between the two parties and 
governments in the interest of the Syrian and Chinese people. 
  The CPC delegation left Damascus for home at noon today at 
the conclusion of a visit of several days to Syria. The 
delegation was seen off at the airport by comrades Mut'ib 
Shinan, member of the Ba'th Party National Command; 'Abdallah 
Abu-al-Rish, member of the Party Control and Inspection 
Committee; Mustafa 'Isa, member of the Executive Bureau of the 
General Federation of Trade Unions; some National Command 
members; and Chinese Ambassador in Damascus Li Qingyu. 
  In a pre-departure statement to the Syrian News Agency, 
SANA, 
Mr. Wei said China -- party, people, and government -- take 
great pride in the deep friendship and sincere cooperation 
between Syria and China. He wished the Syrian Arab people 
further progress and prosperity under the leadership of 
President Hafiz al-Asad. He said the Chinese people greatly 
appreciate and admire the Syrian people's accomplishments under 
the leadership of President Hafiz al-Asad for the sake of 
safeguarding the homeland's independence and sovereignty. 
Comrade Wei expressed his country's constant and firm support 
for the Syrian Arab people's just cause, stressing that China 
believes that the Middle East issue should be solved in a just 
and comprehensive manner on the basis of Security Council 
Resolutions 242 and 338 and in accordance with the principle of 
land for peace and restoration of all occupied Arab territories, 
including the Syrian Golan. He indicated that China objects to 
the trend of hegemony and the policy of force. He said that 
peace has not yet prevailed in the world and that protecting 
world peace and development is still a big issue facing the 
international community. Comrade Wei praised the ties of 
friendship and cooperation between the two friendly countries, 
which are continuously developing in all political, economic, 
cultural, and other spheres. He said relations between the Arab 
Socialist Ba'th Party and the CPC have been developing 
satisfactorily since the establishment of bilateral relations. 
  He concluded his statement by expressing his thanks and 
appreciation for the warm reception accorded to him and his 
delegation in Syria, the cradle of ancient civilization and 
glorious revolutionary traditions.

<F P=106> [Report by Ibrahim al-Amin] </F>
  [Excerpt] Senior officials and government and party circles 
in Lebanon have again been turning their exclusive attention to 
the current negotiations with Israel under the auspices of the 
United States. The failure of U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher's new tour heightened their interest further. 
Christopher obviously leaned toward the Israeli viewpoint, which 
is based on the following sequence: normalization, security, 
and withdrawal. Syria insists on a comprehensive solution and 
on the implementation of the international resolutions in a way 
that secures the reverse order: withdrawal, security, 
normalization. 
  In this regard, visitors quoted a senior Syrian official as 
saying that the peace process is still faltering and that the 
direct U.S. position is now more biased toward Israel. Some 
White House circles, added the official, are working to disavow 
the agreement reached between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill 
Clinton in Geneva early this year, and various types of pressure 
are increasingly being applied to make Syria, Lebanon, and 
Jordan give in to demands for separate peace deals in which 
Israel emerges as the stronger party. 
  The senior Syrian official stressed that Damascus cannot 
accept the U.S.-Israeli proposals but will not try to obstruct 
the negotiations. The Arabs should not try to stop this process 
although it is crippled and running into major trouble, the 
official said. Syria, he added, is preparing to confront every 
form of pressure that Israel, together with the United States 
and some European allies, may apply to force Syria to change its 
position. 
  The senior official recalled before his Lebanese visitors a 
conversation he had with a medium-level U.S. official and 
political delegations. The foreign delegations asked about 
Syria's strengths that make it reject the Israeli proposals and 
resist political pressure. The delegations also asked how Syria 
could face the possibility of war after the collapse of the 
Soviet Union and China's failure to emerge as a new superpower. 
They wondered how Syria could face that possibility when the 
Arabs are walking away from it and the Palestinians are going it 
alone in normalizing ties with Israel. The American delegations 
also cited the deteriorating economic situation in the region in 
general and in the Gulf in particular and the terrible collapse 
of the political, popular, and official Arab positions that 
Syria used to support. 
  The Syrian official said he told his American interlocutors 
that war does not make peace and that Israel's traditional power 
does not conceal its weakness in other ways. He said he 
reminded the Americans of the Vietnam war. Although the 
balances of power were in favor of the United States, the 
Vietnamese people achieved a victory, one that still represents 
an inferiority complex for the Americans. A more vital example 
is formed by events in Lebanon in the past decade. Although 
U.S., European, and Israeli armies occupied most of Lebanon's 
territory, the popular resistance scored formidable victories. 
  The senior Syrian official added: With its current economic 
situation, its reasonable stock of foodstuffs and energy, and 
its relative self-sufficiency in the area of health, Syria can 
hold out for years under pressure. The extensive development 
plans will make Syria even stronger in the next few years--and 
this is apart from Syria's conventional military power not being 
as weak as many imagine. 
  The official stressed that Syria can face a great deal of 
economic, political, and military pressure and does not find 
itself compelled to offer new concessions on any level.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: U.S. circles in Washington close to the 
U.S. State Department have been talking about the possibility of 
Warren Christopher making a new tour of the Middle East mid-June 
in an effort to pull the Syrian-Israeli track out of its current 
stalemate and push the peace process forward. These circles 
indicate that a wide gap separates the Syrian and Israeli 
positions, that much effort should be exerted to narrow that 
gap, that there is no alternative to serious work on the 
Syrian-Israeli track in view of Syria's key role in the peace 
process, and that any progress on this track will reflect on the 
other negotiating tracks. 
  It has become clear that if the United States wants to push 
the peace process forward and achieve a just and real solution 
in the region, it should, in its capacity as the principal 
sponsor of the peace process, direct its efforts toward Israel. 
Israel's rulers, however, do not want a just, comprehensive, 
and stable peace because such a peace will put an end to their 
expansionist plans and will draw borders for their entity at a 
time when they want Israel to remain open without definite 
borders, and to expand. 
  Hence, they bargain over the occupied Arab territories, 
stressing the need to subject Palestinians to a prolonged 
self-rule and to test the Arabs' peaceful intentions by keeping 
their territories under occupation. The Israeli prime minister 
yesterday urged Syria to bypass the Washington talks that 
stemmed from the Madrid conference, pointing out that the 
distinguished relationship between the United States and Israel 
prevents U.S. pressure on Tel Aviv's policy. 
  Syria has always rejected such calls and consider them an 
escape from the requirements of the peace process and an 
encroachment on Security Council resolutions, the bases of the 
Madrid conference, and the principle of land for peace. Secret 
negotiations not only constitute an exposed maneuver to 
undermine the U.S. initiative and a just and comprehensive peace 
formula, but also relieve the United States of its obvious 
commitment to achieving a just, lasting, and comprehensive 
solution based on the international legitimacy's resolutions and 
the principle of land for peace. 
  The secret Palestinian-Israeli negotiations in Oslo and 
their 
resulting distorted, lame agreement is best evidence of Israel's 
intentions and maneuvers. The said agreement has entrenched the 
Israeli occupation, given Israel a free hand in security and 
sovereignty affairs, and placed the Palestinians under 
trusteeship. No noticeable change has occurred in the life of 
Palestinians, except for big names such as self-rule that has no 
more power than the previous municipalities. The occupied 
Palestinian territories have remained under tight military siege. 
  This is Israel's goal from the secret negotiations. It wants 
to split Arab ranks, draw each Arab side into a fragmented 
agreement in isolation of other sides, and blackmail Arab 
parties in general. The Arabs and the cause of peace will be the 
losers because lame agreements do not bring the region closer to 
peace but increase tension and may lead to an explosion. Hence, 
Syria sticks to the Madrid conference formula, the Washington 
talks framework, and the Security Council resolutions. 
  The international community shares this position with Syria 
because it views it as positive and constructive. No agreement 
will be worthy if it does not win the support of the region's 
peoples and lay the groundwork for true peace and a real 
stability. There is nothing so far to indicate any change in 
Israel's policy or shift in the position of Rabin's government. 
  While Syria does not expect any decisive shift from Israel, 
it expects the United States to adopt a more serious and 
effective stand twoard the implementation of Security Council 
resolutions. The special relationship between the United States 
and Israel, on which the Tel Aviv rulers are wagering, should 
not block the international community's authority, principles, 
and laws. 
  The United States committed itself before the entire world 
to 
achieving a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. 
U.S. credibility depends on translating that commitment into a 
fact on the ground, especially since many countries, as well as 
the Americans themselves, are posing urgent questions regarding 
the effectiveness of the U.S. foreign policy. 
  The United States also knows well that total Israeli 
withdrawal from the Golan and the occupied territories is the 
key to peace in the Middle East, and that without such a total 
withdrawal, Syria cannot enter into serious talks on peace. 
Without Syria, the peace process cannot achieve any progress. 
  Syria has always announced its readiness to bring about a 
real, honorable peace and has honestly supported every effort in 
this direction. But such a peace depends on Israel and requires 
the United States and Russia to exercise decisive pressure. 
Peace prospects diminish day after day, and the U.S. initiative 
has been exposed to many shocks and much erosion as a result of 
Israel's intransigence and procrastination.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] Under the headline "Israeli Attacks," TISHRIN 
comments on the continued acts of Israeli aggressive against 
Lebanon. Discussing international indifference toward Israel's 
piratical act of kidnapping Lebanese citizen Mustafa Dayrani 
from his home in Lebanon, TISHRIN explains that this 
indifference has encouraged Israel to persist in its aggressive 
policy against the population of southern Lebanon. 
  TISHRIN adds: While the Arabs, including Lebanon, call for a 
just, honorable peace, Israel insists on lame, phased agreements 
that will give it a free hand and consolidate its hegemony in 
the region, contrary to UN Security Council resolutions and UN 
principles and conventions. The paper adds that Israel is 
behaving as if it is above international law, selecting from the 
UN Security Council resolutions only what is useful for its 
expansionist schemes, usurpation, and settlement. 
  Concluding, TISHRIN says: Israel's attacks will not weaken 
Lebanon's determination to restore its territory. Rather, they 
will consolidate the Arab parties' conviction that the Tel Aviv 
rulers reject a just, comprehensive peace in the Middle East. 
It is the right of Lebanon and the Arabs to escalate resistance 
to ensure Israel's compliance with the resolutions and 
principles of the international community and put an end to the 
aggression it has been continuing for many years. 
  In a commentary, AL-THAWRAH discusses peace Israeli style. 
Practically, the paper says, this peace means taming the region 
and ravishing its countries, people, wealth, and ideologies, 
turning it into an obedient tool in the hands of Israel. 
  After reviewing Israel's practices against the peace 
process, 
up to and including the act of piracy carried out against a 
Lebanese citizen and other attacks on southern Lebanon, the 
paper says this is another image of the peace that Israel wants. 
This is the only peace that it looks for. It is a peace that 
gives Israel a free hand in the region, undeterred by any laws. 
Therefore, it has been pushing peace on the Syrian track toward 
a dead end because the peace Syria understands is the opposite 
of this and because Syria rejects any peace that is not just and 
comprehensive. 
  AL-THAWRAH explains that despite its serious and sincere 
desire for peace, and despite its great appreciation for the 
U.S. role and the Clinton administration's efforts to advance 
the peace process, Syria believes that the United States should 
explicitly and publicly point to the party that is obstructing 
peace and is seeking to impose its own terms, which contradict 
the bases of the peace process and international resolutions. 
  At the end of its commentary, AL-THAWRAH calls on the United 
States to develop its stand and role and to act according to its 
convictions in light of the stands of the parties to the peace 
process. It also calls on the United States to make the side 
obstructing peace comply with peace requirements and implement 
the relevant UN resolutions.

<F P=106> [Second of two-part unattributed report: "Jerusalem Is the </F>
Capital of Palestine" -- numbers of all articles as published] 
  [Text] Yitzhaq Rabin has opted to take an ironic stance 
toward Yasir 'Arafat's recent statements regarding the holy war 
and the possibility that the Palestinians could infringe the 
Cairo agreement. The Israeli prime minister called the PLO 
leader a "big talker." For his part, the Israeli minister of 
police announced that 'Arafat would not be authorized to go to 
Jerusalem during his visit to Gaza and Jericho from 12 to 14 
June. The fundamentalist group Hamas said that it was rejecting 
'Arafat's offer to participate in the Palestinian National 
Authority, of which 19 out of 24 members have recently been 
appointed. Lastly, the Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for 
yesterday's attack in Rafah which killed two Israeli soldiers 
and wounded one. The Jihad said it wanted to punish the Israeli 
army, which captured Shi'ite leader Mustapha Dirani on Saturday 
[21 May] in Lebanon. 
  Today we will finish publishing the extracts of the 
preliminary draft of the Constitution of Palestine that Yasir 
'Arafat recently submitted to lawyer Jean-Marc Varaut. This 
document, which aims to define what will be the basic law of 
Gaza and Jericho during the transitional period agreed with the 
government in Jerusalem, will soon be submitted to the 
Palestinian National Council. As we said in our edition of 26 
May, this text is still subject to amendment, especially since 
the Israelis have a veto right.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-Salam Hijab from Cairo] </F>
  [Text] [Syrian] Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' has 
underlined the importance of the subjects which the foreign 
ministers of the Nonaligned Movement will discuss in their 
conference that will start tomorrow. 
  Answering reporters' questions on arrival at Cairo 
International Airport this afternoon to lead the Syrian 
delegation to the 11th conference of the foreign ministers of 
the Nonaligned Movement, al-Shar' said there are international 
and regional issues, as well as issues of concern to our Arab 
region. These include political and economic issues, he said. 
  The foreign minister added: One important subject at the top 
of the conference agenda is the Arab-Israeli conflict and the 
peace process and its developments, as well as our assessment of 
that process and the Israeli aggressive practices and 
intransigent positions. 
  Asked if there has been any progress in the subject of peace 
with Israel on the Syrian track, the foreign minister stressed 
that there is no progress thus far. He explained that the 
reason for that is Israel's attempt to evade the foundations of 
the peace process and the requirements for peace. Israel, he 
added, also attempts to gain time, thinking that this will be to 
its advantage. 
  Al-Shar' said: We believe this opportunity should not be 
missed. Israel will be the biggest loser if this opportunity is 
missed. 
  Asked if Syria supports secession in Yemen, the foreign 
minister said: We do not support the secession of any Arab 
territory from an Arab state. 
  He added: We are pained by what is happening in Yemen, and 
what is happening should not have happened. 
  Al-Shar' stressed that Syria supports Yemen's unity and a 
quick end to the fighting there. He said the end of fighting 
should coincide with a concern for preserving the Yemeni unity.

  [Excerpts] Cairo, 30 May (MENA) -- President Husni Mubarak 
has affirmed that no draft law on housing has so far been 
finalized and that the housing minister's statements in this 
regard are merely a viewpoints, all of which are still under 
study. 
  The president pointed out that when a final version of this 
law is reached, it will be presented to the public for 
discussion. It will be discussed in all institutions, because it 
is an issue that concerns the broad mass of citizens. 
  Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif made this statement 
after President Mubarak's meeting with the media men on the 11th 
anniversary of such meetings. This meeting lasted for over 3 
hours. [passage omitted] 
  Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif said that after the 
meeting, President Mubarak answered questions posed by prominent 
writers, thinkers, and media men. AL-WAFD Chief Editor Jamal 
Badawi asked a question about Sudan. [passage omitted] 
  President Mubarak answered the question by affirming that it 
is only natural for relations between the Egyptian and Sudanese 
people to be good and that the two peoples have known throughout 
history that they are linked till eternity. [passage omitted] 
  The president noted the various successive stands of the 
Sudanese regime in international forums. It has attempted to 
encourage certain attitudes not commensurate with the standard 
of relations between the two countries, such as when the 
Sudanese delegation recently objected to Egypt's membership in 
the East Africa Trade Organization at a time when Egypt had 
refrained from playing any role in supporting the decision to 
place Sudan on the list of states harboring terrorism. 
  The information minister clarified that President Mubarak 
pointed out the false reports published in some Arab newspapers 
that cited Sudanese newspapers. These reports claimed that Egypt 
has dispatched forces amounting to 10,000 soldiers to the 
Hala'ib area. The president questioned Egypt's incentives in 
sending troops there and who it would be fighting. He said that 
Egypt will not fight the Sudanese people; it has no motive to do 
so. We care a great deal about the Sudanese people, he added. 
  The president added that provocative attempts will not 
affect 
us. We need to be patient and feel comfortable that Egypt's 
security is in safe hands. [passage omitted] 
  The information minister said that during this meeting, 
writer Dr. 'Abd-al-'Azim Ramadan discussed the interviews with 
repentant terrorists recently broadcast on television. He 
affirmed that this is a good move on the part of the television, 
but said that there are fears regarding guarantees of the actual 
repentance of these terrorists and whether they will return to 
terrorism. 
  President Mubarak said: I can set your minds at ease 
regarding the issue of repentant terrorists. We need to be very 
cautious in creating conditions for repentance while keeping 
alert and following up. We ask our returning sons to follow the 
right path and join the nation. [passage omitted] 
  The information minister said President Mubarak highlighted 
the strong links between foreign and internal action. He 
stressed that had it not been for Egypt's international 
relations, no external support for Egypt's economic reform would 
have come. International support for our causes would not have 
come, be it support for the economy, politics, technology or 
trade cooperation, or the opening of markets to Egyptian 
products. 
  The president also noted that there are external issues that 
demand our attention, whether in Arab and Islamic circles or on 
the worldwide level. He used the example of Sudan and the 
events in Yemen, as well as the Somali crisis. He explained 
that these issues are linked to events inside Egypt and to the 
homeland's security. 
  The president also gave the example of Egypt's African role, 
which prompts us to intervene to resolve African differences and 
use its influence in creating an atmosphere of peace among the 
African states. 
  Al-Sharif said that President Mubarak referred to the 
importance of international relations, which have played a role 
in establishing peace. Mubarak pointed out that peace means 
stability of the region and that this stability affects domestic 
policy and cannot be separated from it. He said that the issue 
is not merely stability and the establishment of any peace, but 
peace must be based on the right, justice, and legitimate rights. 
  President Mubarak explained the developments of the 
Palestinian- Israeli contacts which preceded the signing of the 
Declaration of Principles, the contacts between Egypt and Israel 
over the issue, and the subsequent negotiations between the 
Palestinians and Israelis in Oslo. He touched on the obstacles 
that faced the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations throughout the 
talks and Egypt's role in reconciling their views. He noted the 
efforts that were necessary up until the latest agreement was 
signed. He also referred to the details and differences over 
the size of Jericho and Gaza that arose before the signing of 
the agreement. He noted that the differences continued until 
early in the morning of the signing and that differences also 
arose during the signing. He explained that a solution to the 
crisis was reached through an agreement to continue the 
negotiations over the size of Gaza and Jericho, which was signed 
by the cosponsors of the peace process and Egypt. [passage 
omitted] 
  Responding to a question by writer Zakariya Nil on party 
plurality and the lengths to which it might go, in light of 
Algeria's experience, President Mubarak said that this is one of 
the issues on the national dialogue agenda, noting that certain 
people may propose forming new parties. He said: My view is 
that we do not want to divide the people into parties, as this 
would divert us from our main goal of serving the people and 
improving their standard of living. We do not want to engage in 
partisan disputes that may divert us from our devotion to these 
major goals and interests. He said: I want to stress that 
there are parties that play a political and democratic role, but 
other parties have confined their role to publishing a newspaper 
that spreads rumors and casts doubt on the national performance. 
He said that the regime in Egypt is stable and will not be 
affected by certain personal actions. He said: I hope that 
through national dialogue we will be able to reach acceptable 
and logical decisions. He added: Certain people may interpret 
this as going over the head of the national dialogue, but I have 
a right to express my views. 
  In response to a question on the drafting committee and the 
time needed to prepare for the national dialogue, President 
Mubarak said that the dialogue will result in recommendations 
not decisions. He said: When we determine that the 
recommendations serve the interests of society, we will turn 
them into decisions. The decisions should be consistent with 
the people's interests in the present and future. He noted that 
the recommendations will be forwarded to the parties 
concerned--legislative, administrative, or executive bodies such 
the cabinet--for decisions. He noted that he envisions that the 
drafting committee will complete its work in June and that the 
dialogue will have a time limit so that it will achieve its 
goals and not become mere talk and one-upmanship. 
  Answering a question on protecting the Nile's waters from 
pollution in the wake of the dumping of large numbers of human 
bodies in the Rwanda lakes, one of the sources of the Nile 
River, President Mubarak affirmed that the Health Ministry is 
dealing with this issue and that the water is regularly and 
strictly analyzed to ensure it is safe to use. 
  Responding to a question on the Yemeni problem, President 
Mubarak stressed that unity must not be imposed by force but by 
polling the people and sounding out their feelings. He said 
that the use of force to impose unity is wrong. He called for 
halting the war, disengaging the combatants, and trying to bring 
the views of the two parties closer together. He pointed out 
that this is the best solution for the situation. He said that 
no one can impose unity by force; we have our own experience in 
this regard. He noted that if military force had been used to 
impose Syrian-Egyptian unity, it would have had negative 
repercussions and torn asunder the relations between the 
Egyptian and Syrian peoples. He said that leader Jamal 
'Abd-al-Nasir was wise when he made his decision to stop the use 
of military force. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Knesset correspondent Tamar Asalem] </F>
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Addressing the Knesset 
Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee today, Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin said that Israel would not determine the final 
withdrawal line at this point, and that this is holding up the 
negotiations with the Syrians. 
  [Begin Rabin recording] The Syrians are demanding that 
Israel step forward and say what I allegedly told President 
Mubarak [that he is ready to effect a full withdrawal from the 
Golan Heights], and then negotiations would start at once. The 
negotiations are being withheld because we did not say such a 
thing either to the Syrians or to Mubarak. We agreed to a 
withdrawal, but we did not determine its final extent; we did 
not set the final border. 
  Second, a timetable extending over several years. 
  Third, a combination--the first phase of the withdrawal, 
which must be small, must be rewarded by full normalization. 
  Fourth, security arrangements. [end recording] 
  Rabin listed his priorities before the committee members: 
Jerusalem above everything, certain areas in Judaea and Samaria, 
the Golan Heights, and finally Gaza. There are certain areas in 
Judaea and Samaria that I consider more valuable from the 
security and historical point of view than the Golan Heights, he 
said. 
  Turning to the Palestinian issue, he noted that there is as 
yet no dialogue on the next phase, although there is a 
commitment to this effect. You could say that in Gaza there was 
a withdrawal, while the term applying to other territories is 
redeployment, the prime minister remarked. [passage omitted] 
  Replying to a question, the prime minister said that at this 
stage he sees no room for a visit to Jerusalem by 'Arafat, but 
that he could not make any commitments about what will happen in 
another two years. [passage omitted] 
  Another issue raised in the session was the building of a 
dividing fence on Gaza's northern boundaries. Knesset Member 
Binyamin Netanyahu demanded that such a fence be built to create 
a security zone north of the autonomy. [passage omitted] 
  The prime minister explained to the committee members that 
such a fence could not be built at this point due to budgetary 
constraints. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 1500 GMT on 31 May 
notes that "Prime Minister Rabin is quoted in the committee as 
confirming that Israel has been mapping out where the self-rule 
institutions in Jerusalem are located, but he also conceded that 
legally Israel may not be able to act and that new legislation 
may be necessary."]

  [Text] Knesset Member [MK] Ari'el Sharon continues to fund 
raise abroad for activities in the Jewish settlements in Judaea, 
Samaria, and the Gaza Strip. The Council for Jewish Settlements 
in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip says that MK Sharon 
recently raised over $7 million abroad and that he intends to go 
abroad next week to continue the activity. Sharon told our 
correspondent Hayim Hecht that the funds he raises are meant for

  [Text] Baghdad, 31 May (INA)--Vice President Taha Yasin 
Ramadan has said that U.S. officials' nervous statements reflect 
U.S. isolation at the UN Security Council and the fact that U.S. 
misleading tactics have been exposed after the development of 
the stands of most UN Security Council member states and their 
calls for raising the issue of lifting the unjust blockade 
imposed on Iraq. 
  During a meeting with a delegation from the Tunisian 
commission for lifting the blockade imposed on Iraq under 
'Izz-al-Din al-Shabi, the vice president added: America's 
agents and slaves from among Arab and other rulers are suffering 
the same isolation. He stressed that the children of Arabism 
will avenge their nation and will punish those who turned Arab 
land, waters, and wealth into tools to strike at great Iraq and 
its independent revolutionary course. 
  Taha Yasin Ramadan said that the blockade will be terminated 
thanks to the will of the Iraqi people, who set an example in 
willpower, patience, jihad, and construction. He praised the 
genuine pan-Arab stands of the Arab people in Tunis and 
everywhere in the Arab world. He commended their endorsement of 
the causes that Iraq has volunteered to defend and paid immense 
sacrifices for their sake. 
  'Izz-al-Din al-Shabi praised President Saddam Husayn's brave 
leadership, which has become a beacon exposing agents and 
traitors. He stressed the free Arabs' love for Saddam Husayn 
because his excellency has become a symbol of the Arab love for 
freedom, independence, and progress and rejection subordination 
and colonialism.

  [Text] Cairo, 31 May (INA) -- Iraq has protested the 
facilities that are still being provided by Saudi and Kuwaiti 
rulers to American, British, and French aircraft. A letter sent 
by Iraq's permanent Arab League delegate to the League's 
secretariat noted that the facilities extended to the aircraft 
violating Iraqi airspace pose a threat to the security, 
sovereignty, and national unity of the country. 
  From 17 to 23 May, these aircraft mounted 372 sorties, 
having 
taken off from bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. 
  Iraq's League delegate asked that copies of the letter, 
which 
detailed the violations, be circulated among the member states.

  [Text] The head of state, Mr. Liamine Zeroual, today 
received at the Presidency Mr. Yasir 'Arafat, president of the 
state of Palestine. 
  The audience was attended on the Algerian side by Mokdad 
Sifi 
and Mihoub Mihoubi, advisers on diplomatic affairs and 
presidential official spokesman. On the Palestinian side, the 
meeting was attended by the Palestinian ambassador to Algeria, 
Abu al-'Iz, and Yasir Abd Rabbu, head of the PLO Information 
Department. 
  On leaving the office of the head of state, Mr. 'Arafat made 
the following statement: 
  [Begin recording] ['Arafat] First, I had to come here 
following the formation of the first Palestinian administration 
on the first liberated Palestinian territory. I had to come to 
Algeria; this country that always stood by its Palestinian 
brothers; Algeria, which has reiterated and continues to 
reiterate that we are with Palestine, irrespective of whether 
this Palestine was in the right or in the wrong. 
  I briefed the head of state on the latest developments in 
our 
land, and on the formation of the administration and the 
challenges facing us. I thanked him for the support he has 
provided for the Palestinian security forces -- these forces 
that left this country for our land. Yesterday, these forces 
made moves using all their equipment; all this highlights the 
significance of these deeply rooted and original 
Palestinian-Algerian relations. 
  Also, we tackled all the problems facing the Palestinian 
national authority, especially now that we are starting from 
zero. Our underlying structure was totally destroyed by the 
Israeli occupation. The head of state reiterated to me and to 
my brothers that Algeria will remain on the side of the 
Palestinian people until, God willing, we pray in holy Jerusalem. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, what are the 
priorities of the political program? 
  ['Arafat] You have seen the published program. The most 
important issue for us now is to stress our national unity, 
because we look forward to establishing a modern and democratic 
state. We take into consideration the pan-Arab relations that 
link us with our Arab nation. We also take into account the 
far-sightedness, originality and religions and spiritual 
foundations of Palestine, the first of the two kiblahs and the 
third holy mosque; sacred places for both prophet Mohammed, 
God's peace and prayers be upon Him, and Christ, peace be upon 
Him. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Commentary by defense analyst Rahul Roy Chowdhury] </F>
  [Text] The commissioning of the submarine INS [Indian 
Naval Ship] Shankul by the prime minister is a significant 
achievement for both the country and the navy. It demonstrates 
India's ability to indigenously build a highly complex and 
sophisticated warship along with the navy's resolve to 
adequately defend its maritime interests in the Indian Ocean. 
Both these issues continue to remain critical to Indian 
security. Shankul is only the second submarine to have been 
built in India. The first such submarine INS Shalki was 
commissioned into the Indian Navy just over two years ago. Both 
these vessels were constructed at the Defense Ministry's 
Mazagaon shipyard in Bombay. While a German (?sales) firm 
provided material packages and access to certain technologies, 
Indian workers carried out the bulk of the construction work on 
the submarine. This included the welding of the hulls and 
manufacture of various critical items and components. Through 
these activities they have been able to gain sufficient 
experience for the construction of similar vessels in future. 
  Shankul is a modern and sophisticated submarine which is to 
be used primarily for antisubmarine and antiship operations in a 
situation of war. It has a standard displacement of 1,450 tons 
and is formally classified as a stretched and a heavier version 
of the German HDW class 209 type of vessel. While its level of 
(?self-noise) is relatively lower than other submarines of its 
class, its range of some 8,000 miles is considered to be a 
record one. Shankul is also well-armed with eight 21-inch 
Torpedo tubes and mines. In addition, it is equipped with 
advanced radar and solar systems. Amongst the submarines 
operated by the Indian Navy, Shankul and Shalki are unique as 
they possess an integrated (?escutcheon) for the entire crew at 
times of emergency. With the commissioning of Shankul, the 
strength of the Indian Navy's submarine force has risen to 18. 
Besides the two built in India, it comprises submarines 
acquired from Germany and the erstwhile Soviet Union. The 
acquisition of additional vessels in the last few years became 
necessary to replace an older class of submarines and to defend 
India's extended maritime interests in the Indian Ocean.

  [Text] Rafah, 1 Jun (MENA) -- The Palestinian civilian 
authorities have started to exercise their full power in the 
autonomy areas in Gaza and Jericho as of today. Staff Major 
General 'Abd-al-Raziq al-Majaydah, commander of the Palestinian 
National Security Forces, stated that a Palestinian-Israeli 
higher coordination committee has been formed and that three 
Palestinian liaison subcommittees were formed in Jericho, Gaza, 
and Khan Yunus to discuss outstanding matters and to come to a 
solution to the remaining problems that obstruct the 
implementation of the agreement, primarily the issue of borders 
and crossing points. 
  The autonomy areas have been divided into three zones, each 
entrusted to an official. They are North Gaza, from Wadi Gaza 
to Bayt Hanun, entrusted to Colonel Sulayman Halas; South Gaza, 
from Wadi Gaza to Rafah, entrusted to Brigadier General 
'Abd-al-Mu'ti al-Sab'awi; and Jericho, including the city of 
Jericho and camps, entrusted to Brigadier General Sa'id Naji. 
  Maj. Gen. al-Majaydah remarked that these appointments are 
temporary and are designed to run matters in the National 
Authority areas until Yasir 'Arafat completes his appointments. 
  In another development, a group of 222 Palestinian police of 
varying ranks from Tunis crossed the Rafah border point today. 
Another 600 individuals are expected to arrive from Libya this 
evening and a third group will arrive from Tunis in the next two 
days. 
  Meanwhile, the Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and 
Islamic Jihad commands have decided to cooperate with the 
Palestinian National Authority on building the state, to abandon 
violence, and to form a political party to discuss matters 
objectively to serve the interests of the Palestinian people.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "'Ashrawi Tells AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: </F>
My Rejection of the Information Portfolio in the Authority is 
in Line With My Previous Positions"] 
  [Excerpts] Tunis, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi, 
former spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation to Washington 
negotiations, has said that her refusal to assume the 
information ministry portfolio offered to her recently was in 
line with her previous position. 
  Replying to the numerous questions aroused by her 
participation in the authority council's meetings without being 
a member of it, 'Ashrawi told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: From the 
outset I have chosen to lead the independent Palestinian 
committee for human rights. It was my commitment, especially as 
it is an agency working for the sake of achieving the 
Palestinian people's public welfare. 
  'Ashrawi said that "what is more important than holding 
posts 
and assuming portfolios is to agree on a foundation and a 
binding working program from which the National Authority 
Council's work proceeds." That is what prompted her to 
participate in its meetings and in drafting its program to 
ensure that the principles and aims binding on the authority 
council have been prepared and drafted by numerous people from 
among the Palestinian people. [passage omitted] 
  Responding to a statement by a Palestinian oppositionist, in 
which he said that in joining the authority council 'Ashrawi is 
exercising oneupmanship over the opposition, she said: "It has 
nothing to do with oneupmanship at all. I am not an 
oppositionist. Nor am I part of the authority. I am just part 
of society. And I believe that the language of oneupmanship 
have gone and been overtaken by events." [passage omitted]

  [Text] The head of the Palestinian police, General Nasr 
Yusuf, says his forces will refuse to hand over to Israel 
Palestinians who committed crimes against Israelis and sought 
refuge in the self-rule areas. Yusuf, speaking to reporters in 
Gaza, says the Palestinian police will arrest and charge the 
killers of two Arabs suspected of cooperating with Israel in 
Gaza over the weekend. The police sent representatives to their 
funerals and have launched an investigation into the killings. 
Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] claimed responsibility for 
the deaths despite its agreement last month to suspend attacks 
on so called collaborators. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0400 GMT on 29 May 
reports that "General Yusuf said that the Palestinian police 
would issue gun permits to residents of the autonomy, but 
ascertain that the gun would only use their weapons to protect 
their homes and not carry them in the street."]

the Bedouins and the Palestinians, according to MK al-Sani'. 
Al-Rujub denied he has said that the opponents of the agreement 
are entitled to continue the armed struggle. 
  [Al-Rujub] I said that all citizens must honor the agreement 
signed by the PLO, because the PLO is the sole representative of 
the Palestinian people. Soon we will have elections, and if 
they score success we will salute them. [passage omitted] [end

Participate with Four Seats in Authority"] 
  [Excerpt] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- A senior Hamas 
official has stressed that his movement turned down an offer 
from Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat to participate in the 
self-rule authority. 
  Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman for Hamas, has said: "I 
would like to point out that Yasir 'Arafat sent (Fatah Central 
Committee member) 'Abbas Zaki to meet with Hamas officials. And 
that Zaki conveyed to Muhammad Nazzal (Hamas representative in 
Amman) 'Arafat's offer to grant Hamas four seats only." 
  But according to Ghawshah, the offer was completely 
rejected, 
"because we refuse to participate in the authority, proceeding 
from our rejection of the self-rule agreements, as they 
perpetuate the occupation of Arab territory in Palestine."

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman for </F>
the Hamas Movement, by Samih al-Ma'ayitah in Damascus; date not 
given] 
  [Text] [Al-Ma'ayitah] The topical issue is how Hamas will 
deal with the self-rule authority. The Movement has to choose 
between confrontation, understanding, or a truce. What option 
have the Movement's bodies adopted? 
  [Ghawshah] This issue is complex and wide-ranging. I will 
try to discuss the basic topics dealing with it. First, let us 
say that the stage of theorization about what stand Hamas will 
adopt if the Palestinian authority is imposed and the 
Palestinian police enters the self-rule areas is over. All the 
Palestinian forces, those who supported or opposed the peace 
process which started in Madrid and ended with the Cairo 
agreement are now treading on a minefield. They all should think 
before taking any step to avoid an explosion that would destroy 
everything. Hamas has taken measures to counter this stage. 
The Hamas Movement has resorted to all that is in its power to 
confront the march of capitulation which began in Madrid, and 
succeeded in obstructing and delaying this march. There is a 
mighty force behind this process, represented by the United 
States, the Zionist forces, and the regimes loyal to them, and 
these forces succeded in imposing the Cairo and Oslo agreement 
on the Palestinian people. The hands of the clock cannot be set 
back, but we can make proposals that would prevent the explosion 
and at least limit the losses. We in the Hamas Movement 
approach the Palestinian authority and the police force with 
caution. We will judge them on the basis of their deeds and 
not their words, especially sweet talk which is rife at the 
present time. We believe that avoiding confrontation is a 
national and religious duty by which all should abide. 
  The Hamas Movement has translated this into a political 
stand 
and decision not to confront the Palestinian authority and 
police force. We will deal with them in a civilized and peaceful 
manner by highlighting the mistakes, secrets, and loopholes in 
the Cairo and Oslo agreements and mobilizing the masses and 
forces in and outside the territories to reject this agreement 
and foil it with civilized methods. This is the stand of the 
Palestinian opposition, represented in the Alliance of 
Palestinian Forces. The Palestinian police force is part of the 
Palestinian people. Most of its members are from the Palestine 
Liberation Army [PLA] and had fought the Zionists in many 
places, particularly in Lebanon during the Zionist invasion of 
that country. We are fully convinced and we know that this 
police force has decided not to confront the Palestinian people 
with bullets. But the overwhelming circumstances to which I 
referred at the beginning of the interview have forced the PLA 
to become a police force that carries out joint patrols with the 
Jews, and whose members eat with the Jews and live with them and 
normalize their relations with them. We are fully convinced 
that the members of this police force will not open fire on the 
children of the stones or the strugglers whose role has been 
instrumental in achieving the partial withdrawal from the Gaza 
Strip, and whose role will also be instrumental in achieving any 
future withdrawal from the West Bank. This has taken place 
thanks to the blood they had shed and their sacrifices and not 
as a result of the intelligence and ability of the negotiators. 
  [Al-Ma'ayitah] A few months ago, Hamas used to call the 
Palestinian police force as a Lahd army. Now you speak 
positively about it and somewhat praise it. Is this a 
retraction or is there something new? 
  [Ghawshah] Hamas never described the Palestinian police 
force 
as a Lahd army. We said that this force supposedly should be 
part of the Palestinian people. We also said that if the 
cadres which head this police force make it stand against its 
people, protect the settlements and bestows legitimacy on the 
Zionist occupation, then this police force will become like the 
Lahd army. That's why Hamas will act on the basis of deeds and 
not words. 
  The Palestinian people welcomed this police force because it 
means they no longer have to deal with the occupation. They 
emotionally welcomed this police force bearing in mind too its 
previous militant background. There is a secret struggle 
between good elements and the other elements within this police 
force. An example of this is the officer who prevented the 
Zionist commander of the southern front from entering the 
Palestinian area. Unfortunately, this officer was arrested and 
will be tried. Other Palestinian opposition members were also 
arrested. The question of weapons will be the test that will 
show what are the real intentions of the command of the 
Palestinian police force. 
  [Al-Ma'ayitah] Major General Nasr Yusuf has made a 
statement on the issue of arms collection. As for yourself, you 
have said that this issue is taboo and a red line. Do you 
believe that Maj. Gen. Yusuf's statement was meant to be 
implemented? Or do you think it was made merely for media 
purposes? 
  [Ghawshah] The Hamas Movement knows Maj. Gen. Nasr Yusuf 
well. He is a member of the Fatah Central Committee. He took 
part in previous dialogues between Fatah and Hamas. He signed 
the Khartoum agreement on 4 January 1993. It is our hope that 
the police command and Maj. Gen. Nasr will uphold the ideas he 
set forth during these closed meetings, the ideas regarding his 
support for the Palestinian people, as well as his respect for 
and willingness to protect all Palestinian mujahidin. 
  The arms issue is indeed sensitive and important. It 
constitutes a red line. There are various weapons at stake. 
The most important of these are the weapons used by the 
mujahidin affiliated with the al-Qassam Battalions and other 
Palestinian forces. These weapons were only used in resistance 
to occupation troops and settlers. Everybody is well aware that 
weapons are dear to the mujahidin. The mujahidin's weapons are 
sacred. They should remain in the hands of the mujahidin. The 
mujahidin's right to bear arms is enshrined in all temporal 
charters and heavenly faiths. Additionally, the collection of 
arms from the Palestinian people is unacceptable. This is 
because it should be unacceptable to disarm the Palestinian 
people as long as there are occupation troops, settlements, and 
settlers on our territory. How can the Palestinian policemen 
disarm the Palestinian people, and allow settlers to move freely 
with their weapons in the autonomous areas? 
  The Palestinian people were disarmed in 1948 and 1967, and 
the results were catastrophic. That is why Hamas contended that 
disarming people is a red line that should not be crossed. 
  [Al-Ma'ayitah] What about the Hamas Movement's military 
activities since the start of efforts to implement the autonomy 
agreement? 
  [Ghawshah] The Hamas Movement has explained that it will 
uphold its principled Islamic jihad stand. Our jihad will 
continue as long as the occupation of our territories is 
maintained. The questions posed in this regard are the 
following: Have the autonomous areas been fully liberated? Has 
there been complete withdrawal? The answer is that there has 
been no complete withdrawal from the autonomous areas, 
particularly the Gaza Strip. For the Zionists are occupying 
more than 20 percent of the area of the Gaza Strip, particularly 
the Gush Qatif area, in which there are 16 settlements and 5,000 
settlers. The selection of Zionist targets for attacks is made 
at the operations room of the al-Qassam Battalions in the West 
Bank, Gaza Strip, and the Palestinian territories occupied in 
1948. 
  [Al-Ma'ayitah] Has Hamas thought of launching an opposition 
political party? Has it considered the idea of cooperating with 
some forces and figures to launch such a party so that it may 
deal politically with the self-rule authority? 
  [Ghawshah] Various reports and rumors have circulated 
regarding the formation of some parties. It seems that Fatah 
will launch some parties in cooperation with several independent 
figures so that it may impose its political hegemony in the 
autonomous areas. 
  The question posed in this regard is: Will Fatah allow elbow 
room for other political forces? As regards the Hamas Movement, 
this issue is under consideration, particularly since it was 
dictated by the developments of the current phase. However, the 
launching of parties has its pros and cons; and the cons might 
outweigh the pros. The launching of parties that implicitly 
approve the Palestinian-Israeli agreement might be facilitated. 
  [Al-Ma'ayitah] Hamas has declared its rejection of an offer 
made by 'Arafat to take part in the self-rule authority. 
'Arafat is well aware of the principled Hamas stand in this 
regard. How then do you explain this offer by 'Arafat? 
  [Ghawshah] The offer to involve us in this authority was 
communicated to us by 'Abbas Zaki. The Hamas Movement examined 
the offer immediately. Hamas decided to refuse to take part in 
the self-rule authority in line with its rejection of the Cairo 
agreement. Zaki offered us a number of seats on the self-rule 
authority council equal to the number to be allocated for Fatah. 
This is reminiscent of the tactics the Fatah Movement and 
'Arafat used when the issue of Hamas' joining the Palestine 
National Council and the PLO Central Council was debated. 
  Our explanation of this offer, and all other offers by 
'Arafat, for that matter, is that they are always made within 
the context of the carrot and stick policy he pursues. Threats 
always accompany his offers. He always warns of his ability to 
penetrate the factions with which he negotiates. There are 
attempts to involve several independent Islamists in the 
Palestinian self-rule authority council to insinuate that some 
Islamists accept self-rule. Using threats, he is laying the 
grounds for penetration; and this is something we are capable of 
handling. Any surprises or deception tactics citing the dispute 
over the number of seats on the self-rule authority council will 
be exposed. 
  [Al-Ma'ayitah] A few days ago, U.S. Assistant Secretary of 
State Robert Pelletreau noted the existence of differences and 
trends within Hamas, and that thanks to certain PLO figures some 
Hamas figures are taking a positive approach to the agreement. 
There had been further such talk before that. What is the true 
state of affairs? 
  [Ghawshah] I heard these statements on Radio Monte Carlo 
last Friday. Pelletreau was said to be thrilled with the news 
of a split within Hamas, brought on thanks to the efforts of 
some PLO figures. As a spokesman for Hamas, let me tell you the 
reports are groundless. Hamas is a monolith. Throughout its 
jihad history, the movement has been shown to be solidly united. 
The movement was founded on Islam and an adherence to the 
constants of the Palestinian people. I am told that 'Arafat was 
heard by a Fatah Central Committee member saying saying that he 
was baffled by Hamas. All the efforts made to entice the 
movement into joining hands with the PLO so as to share the 
responsibility for the Madrid, Oslo, and Cairo agreements, and 
the Washington talks came to nothing. I am positive the Tunis 
leadership will fail to attract or infiltrate any Hamas leaders 
or rank and file. 
  The Tunis leadership has managed to cause splits in other 
factions, but these lack the moral fiber and organization that 
sets Hamas apart. All rumors of splits within Hamas have proved 
unfounded. 
  [Al-Ma'ayitah] Palestinian factions have long been bedeviled 
by the complexities of the link between their interior and 
foreign-based cadres, with those inside the occupied territories 
receiving instructions from the leadership in exile. What has 
Hamas done to get around such complications? 
  [Ghawshah] As for 'Arafat's Fatah, the strings are pulled by 
leaders based outside the homeland. 'Arafat has personalized 
Fatah. Hamas, on the other hand, was founded on Islamic 
principles and a clear vision, thus affording it the required 
resilience and flexibility to withstand intense pressure and 
tackle heavy blows received both inside and outside the homeland. 
  The Tunis leadership has sought to capitalize on the crises 
and ordeals that Hamas has been through in the inside to 
penetrate the movement. Fatah attempted to get through to Ahmad 
Yasin in prison and fabricated news and scenarios to put our 
movement and its credibility in a bad light. 
  [Al-Ma'ayitah] It is now three years since the opposition 
was launched under the name of the 10 factions, and, more 
recently, the Alliance of Palestinian Factions [APF] was formed. 
Don't you think that this is as far as these factions will go 
-- a ceiling that is not measuring up to the challenges? 
  [Ghawshah] You may recall that in late 1993, following the 
signing of the Oslo accord, Hamas pressed for a provisional 
Palestinian leadership to take over. Regrettably, however, a 
number of the Palestinian factions had their sights set too low. 
We were so anxious for the 10 factions' formula to get off the 
ground that we went along with a formula based on political 
tasks rather than a political agenda, governed by a majority 
consensus rather than unanimity. We knew that this was not 
exactly the right formula, and hoped that it will be developed. 
Hamas, however, found itself a loner in the field, particularly 
regarding the intifadah and militarily. When they demanded that 
a combined nationalist-Islamic command be instituted inside the 
homeland, we demanded confidence-building initiatives on their 
part. For example, having refused to consider an alliance with 
Islamic forces in the elections for the Dentists Association in 
Gaza so that we may beat the capitulationist candidates, the 
democratic forces should not go on to call for a unified 
command. How can can there be a unified command if these other 
factions are not active in terms of jihad and the intifadah. 
This and other obstacles have stood in the way of refining the 
APF's formula. 
  [Al-Ma'ayitah] Some people accuse you of arrogance and 
attempting to dominate, and hold you responsible for the failure 
of developing the APF formula. 
  [Ghawshah] Yes, we are accused. Some factions have inherited 
such attitudes from 'Arafat's Fatah and are trying to repeat 
them in their dealing with Hamas, although facts on the ground 
indicate that Hamas has made more sacrifices than others and is 
less prejudiced than other factions. Therefore, it agreed to 
participate in the APF to preserve the unity of the opposition. 
Regrettably, whenever Hamas finds itself in a crisis as a 
result of the Zionist-U.S. onslaught inside and outside [the 
occupied territories], these factions fish in murky water and 
direct their arrows at the movement. We admit that some 
factions trust Hamas and give it every support. The APF formula 
needs reformulation in light of new factors. It may be better 
to establish a wide opposition front during the next stage--a 
front which has a definite concept and in which every one in the 
occupied territories takes part with all his might--and to 
activate the Palestinian diaspora. The Palestinian people in 
the diaspora, however, are the big losers. 
  [Al-Ma'ayitah] Is Hamas' decision to continue the intifadah 
still valid or is it under study and reconsideration? 
  [Ghawshah] There is no doubt that the new era, as well as 
epitomizing the self-rule on the ground, will affect the 
intifadah, which is aimed at ending the occupation. As a 
result, the intifadah activity will drop in areas from which the 
Zionist forces withdraw. However, the intifadah's activities are 
numerous. Some activities are expected to reduce in the 
self-rule area after the end of the occupation, and some other 
activities will lead to friction with the self-rule authority 
and its supporters. The Hamas Movement will study and assess 
these matters, as well as intifadah activities, to secure the 
desired results and eliminate negative factors. Hamas may call 
for the reduction of some intifadah activities that have no 
impact on the overall conflict with the Zionists, especially 
within the self-rule area. But jihad and resistance will 
continue against the occupation everywhere. 
  [Al-Ma'ayitah] Is Hamas satisfied by the interaction of 
Islamic peoples and movements with the intifadah and Hamas' role? 
  [Ghawshah] We are in constant touch with Arab and Islamic 
peoples. Most of these people strongly support the intifadah 
and jihad in Palestine, and we know well that large sectors of 
these peoples sympathize with Hamas. 
  Regarding Arab and Islamic parties and movements, we feel 
that they are short of supporting the intifadah and jihad of the 
Palestinian people, including the Hamas Movement. What is 
really painful is that many Islamic movements are so preoccupied 
with their own concerns and issues that they cannot pay enough 
attention to the Palestine question, while everybody knows that 
the Zionist enemy exploits every loophole. It jumps to 
Indonesia, Qatar, and Oman and takes root in Egypt. The 
Palestine question should be listed at the top of the agenda of 
the Islamic movements because the Zionist danger threatens every 
one. Some movements, which try to court the West and the United 
States, are despised and humiliated by the West. Some movements 
have not defined their stand on the Gaza-Jericho accord and some 
others support it to win U.S. approval. We are with political 
flexibility that does not encroach on principles. 
  The Islamic movements in the cordon states have a basic role 
to play in supporting jihad activity undertaken by Hamas inside 
Palestine. These movements's political, popular, and militant 
performance has not reached the level required in the Islamic 
and political arenas.

<F P=106> [Report by Ibrahim Humaydi: "Fatah Leadership Has Not </F>
Issued Decision To Withdraw Palestinians' Arms"] 
  [Excerpts] Damascus -- Fatah Central Committee member 
'Abbas Zaki has stressed that he has obtained assurances from 
leaders of the Palestinian forces opposed to the Oslo accord to 
prevent "Palestinian infighting." He said that he had urged 
them to "coordinate among themselves on fundamental issues like 
settlements, Jerusalem, and the refugees' return." [passage 
omitted] 
  'Abbas Zaki denied that Fatah has issued a decision to 
withdraw arms from the Palestinians, "especially as there are 
armed Israelis outside the police and the Army.... When there 
is incomplete sovereignty over Gaza and Jericho and a partner 
participating in ruling these areas, it is extremely difficult 
to apply the decision to Jericho or Gaza, or to the Palestinians 
and not the settlers." However, he pointed out that there is a 
big differences between a decision issued by Fatah and "a 
process conducted here or there and which we tackle in time.... 
We might withdraw arms from those who err, but to eliminate 
arms completely without any guarantees and while there are armed 
people outside the Israeli police -- that would be an unjust 
decision. And we cannot take such a decision." He added: "The 
time has not yet come to withdraw the arms. We will withdraw 
them when we take direct responsibility for the area without 
anyone's participation." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Reports by Salih Qallab in Amman and AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT </F>
bureau in Cairo: "Syrian-Jordanian-Lebanese Consultations To 
Counter Israel's `Middle East Market' Proposal"] 
  [Excerpt] Highly placed diplomatic sources have revealed 
that Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon have reached an advanced stage 
in consultations -- with the participation of King Husayn of 
Jordan and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad -- aimed at 
crystallizing a strong economic bloc in the region capable of 
standing fast in the face of Israel in the future after the 
creation of the so-called "Middle East market." 
  According to the same sources, the Syrian-Jordanian-Lebanese 
consultations and meetings in this connection have made great 
progress and the technical experts from the three countries have 
completed the major part of the draft concepts and required 
studies and all that remains is the political decision which 
awaits the right circumstances in the region and at Arab and 
international levels. 
  It seems that the United States and Russia are aware of 
these 
moves and that the issue was discussed by Presidents Clinton and 
al-Asad during their latest meeting in Geneva some months ago. 
The issue was also discussed with Syrian, Jordanian, and 
Lebanese officials by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
and Viktor Kosovalyuk, head of the Middle East and North Africa 
Section at the Russian Foreign Ministry, on their successive 
visits to the region. 
  Some circles believe that this development, which had not 
previously been disclosed or publicized, might have something to 
do with the Syrian position passed to U.S. and Russian 
officials, that if Syria is to participate in the peace process 
in the region, it must play a regional part in the Middle East. 
  The question being asked is whether the PLO and the National 
Authority in Gaza and Jericho, and later in the West Bank, would 
be given any part in that process. Some say that the 
Palestinian part would come at a later stage when the situation 
stabilizes and becomes clearer, but others claim that Syria has 
imposed a veto against the PLO on the grounds that the latter 
accepted a separate solution and concluded agreements considered 
by Syria to be in the interest of Israel's future economic 
designs. 
  The same sources say that the Iraqis were perhaps informed 
by 
Jordan or Syria indirectly about the formation of such a bloc. 
The sources add, however, that Iraq, in its current situation, 
can only listen to such ideas but even in the long run it would 
have priorities other than such a bloc, especially rebuilding 
what was destroyed by the war and years of boycott. 
  The Egyptians most probably know about the aforementioned 
economic bloc but they do not favor such a step or talking about 
at this sensitive stage, particularly as that might affect the 
current peace process. 
  Some circles believe that Syria, in agreement with Jordan 
and 
Lebanon, perhaps deliberately brandished the bloc card to put 
pressure on Israel and the United States for more concessions on 
the question of withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights.

  [Text] Cairo, 1 Jun (MENA) -- [Egyptian] Foreign Minister 
'Amr Musa has explained that Serbia was not invited to the 
Non-Aligned Movement [NAM] foreign ministers conference in 
accordance with an agreement between the Movement's chairman, 
Indonesia, and Egypt. He noted that this issue had not been 
raised by any member, either during general meetings or at 
committee meetings or consultations. 
  Musa was replying to a question by a MENA correspondent on 
why Serbia was not invited. He said: As chairman of the NAM 
foreign ministers conference, Egypt is bound by the measures 
decided upon in the New York coordination office and during 
consultations in Jakarta and agreed upon by NAM members. 
According to these measures, Serbia will not attend NAM 
meetings unless a matter relating to its own entity is being 
discussed, Musa explained. Only in such a case can Serbia be 
invited to give its opinion on the matter, he said. 
  Musa affirmed that there is a consensus on banning Serbia's 
and Montenegro's participation in NAM meetings.

  [Text] [Pakistani] Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali 
has told the Non-Aligned Movement [NAM] ministerial meeting in 
Cairo that the Kashmiri people's right to self-determination is 
an acclaimed, undeniable, and irreversible truth and should not 
be subjected to political expediency. 
  Addressing the meeting, the foreign minister stressed that 
the process of self-determination must be completed by granting 
the right of self-determination to the people of Jammu and 
Kashmir, who are engaged in a relentless struggle against Indian 
oppression. He said the cruelty that has been adopted to crush 
the Kashmiri people's struggle is unparalleled in history. The 
official machinery and institutions in occupied Kashmir have a 
free hand to commit all sorts of atrocities to suppress the 
people's aspirations. Torture, the molestation of women, the 
death of people in detention, robbery, and the burning of 
people's houses have become routine. These cruel activities are 
being committed by the more than 500,000 occupation forces 
deployed in occupied Kashmir. 
  The foreign minister also told the Non-Aligned Movement 
ministerial meeting that massive attempts are being made to 
misrepresent the indigenous uprising launched by the people of 
Kashmir. Allegations are being made about foreign interference 
and assistance in this regard. He reminded India that the light 
of freedom has never been extinguished by oppression and terror. 
He said this misleading and cruel policy is no answer to the 
situation in occupied Kashmir. The only solution to the Kashmir 
issue is to implement the UN Security Council resolution.

  [Text] India has criticized Pakistan for raising the 
Kashmir issue at the Non-Aligned Foreign Minister's meeting, 
saying the movement cannot be involved in the matter. The 
minister of state for external affairs, Mr. R.L. Bhatia, told 
the meeting in Cairo that New Delhi has always been ready for 
the dialogue with Pakistan on the Kashmir issue but there has 
been little response from Islamabad. In a strongly worded 
response to a Pakistani demand for intervention by NAM 
[Non-Aligned Movement] in the issue, Mr. Bhatia said: Pakistan 
is inflicting enormous suffering on the people of New Delhi 
through state sponsored terrorism. He asserted that Kashmir is 
and will always remain an integral part of India. 
  Mr. Bhatia reminded the meeting of the ruling by the NAM 
chairman Indonesia that bilateral disputes should not be 
discussed at the NAM meeting. He said: Any moves going against 
the ruling can only weaken the movement.

  [Text] Cairo, 1 Jun (INA) -- Iraq has called on the 
Non-Aligned Movement [NAM] countries to activate economic, 
political, and trade cooperation among its membership and to 
take an interest in collective coordination in all fields in 
order to serve their vital interests in the world and to face 
current challenges. Addressing the NAM conference today, 
Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf, Iraq's foreign minister and head of 
the Iraqi delegation to the conference, said that Iraq proposes 
laying a foundation for cooperation and coordination among the 
NAM countries and called on NAM to study practical proposals 
through which the movement could contribute to reorganizing the 
United Nations as it currently exists. 
  Al-Sahhaf said: Reorganizing the United Nations should be 
based on objective grounds that guarantees equality and respect 
for state's sovereignty, independence, and free choice. This, 
he added, would produce a new formula that prevents a few rich 
states from exploiting this organization for their own interests 
and imposing hegemony over the world. 
  The foreign minister called on NAM to study the possibility 
of activating cooperation among its member states in specific 
fields, particularly with regard to trade and economic relations 
with industrialized countries. This cooperation, he added, 
would give NAM countries greater power because they would share 
interests with other countries. 
  Responding to the speech delivered by the representative of 
the Kuwaiti rulers -- who issued a host of allegations and 
slanders that are not in harmony with the general spirit of the 
conference represented by the call for dialogue, reconciliation, 
and solving problems through peaceful means -- Muhammad Sa'id 
al-Sahhaf said: The Government of Iraq has fulfilled all 
measures requested by the Security Council in accordance with 
Security Council Resolutions 686 and 687. He added that this 
was documented in four letters circulated as official documents 
at the Security Council. He said: The position of the Iraqi 
Government vis-a-vis these resolutions still exists as 
stipulated by these letters, which were accepted by the Security 
Council, which established a permanent cease-fire on the basis 
of these letters. The minister noted that anything contrary to 
this means the existence of a contradiction between what is 
required by Security Council Resolution 686 and the 
establishment of a permanent cease-fire in accordance with 
Resolution 687. 
  The Iraqi foreign minister noted in his speech that the 
United Nations and the UN Special Commission have admitted that 
Iraq has implemented all the requirements of disarmament, which 
is considered an important chapter of Resolution 687. He added 
that Iraq's fulfillment of its commitments, as stipulated by 
this chapter, requires that the Security Council so far because 
of the intransigence of one country that imposes its opinion and 
hegemony over the council thereby constituting a political 
blackmail to achieve its personal interests. [sentence as 
received] 
  Regarding the issue of missing Kuwaitis, the foreign 
minister 
reiterated that Iraq has no interest in keeping a single Kuwaiti 
in prison and that there is not one prisoner in Iraq. He said: 
We released all prisoners, including members of the ruling 
Kuwaiti family. The issue of missing persons was fabricated by 
the other party, which has turned it into a political, not a 
humanitarian, problem. 
  Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf said: Foreign interests represent a 
major factor in maintaining instability in the region so as to 
justify their military and political presence, to make big 
profits from arms deals, and to impose trade deals and projects 
so as to invigorate their economy at the expense of stability, 
peace, and security in the region. 
  Al-Sahhaf said that, contrary to certain parties' claims, 
Iraq is earnest and concerned about taking sound technical and 
legal steps to implement the Security Council resolutions and to 
take various initiatives so as to normalize the situation in the 
region. He noted that the last initiative was declared by the 
speaker of the Iraqi National Assembly in which he called on the 
Kuwaiti parliament to embark on dialogue and resolve suspended 
problems between the two countries. He added: However, the 
Kuwaiti parliament rejected this call with arrogance. 
  Concluding his speech, the foreign minister welcomed the 
Republic of South Africa for joining NAM as a full member state.

  [Text] Cairo, June 2, IRNA -- Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali 
Akbar Velayati here Wednesday [1 June] said that the non-aligned 
countries have traditionally demanded a time-bound framework, 
including a target date for removal and destruction of the 
entire stockpile of nuclear weapons. 
  Velayati, here for the 11th session of the Non-Aligned 
Movement (NAM) ministerial meeting, made the remark in his 
address to the NAM session on te issue of disarmament. 
  The issue of security assurances for non-nuclear weapon 
states is the second major point, Velayati said. 
  The non-aligned countries should insist that the 
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) be finalized before the NPT 
review conference and that it should be comprehensive, 
verifiable, non-discriminatory and devoid of any 
exceptionalities. How to deal with the existing nuclear test 
sites also remains as an important task, he said. 
  In this respect, added Velayati, the non-aligned countries 
also welcome the decision of the [UN] General Assembly to start 
negotiations on a treaty banning the production of fissile 
materials for weapon purpose. 
  On the chemical weapons convention, he said that the 
non-aligned members of the Chemical Weapon Convention (CWC) need 
to consolidate their efforts to make certain that their views 
and positions on issues ranging from definition of chemical 
weapons and modalities of challenge inspection to the problem of 
technological assistance and peaceful use as well as their fair 
share in the organisation are met before ratification and 
entering into force of the convention. 
  As for biological weaapons, Velayati said that what may be 
at 
stake is the health requirements of the developing countries as 
significant parts of the pharmaceutical industry, including 
serum and vaccine production, will be affected by discussions 
due to take place at the special conference in September this 
year. 
  Touching on the issue of transparency in armament, the 
Iranian foreign minister said debate continues on the scope and 
expansion of the register. 
  "It is realized that regional arrangements is an essential 
ingredient for a complete register and, therefore, for the 
success of transparency in armament. This may also open the way 
for the reduction of conventional weapons both at regional and 
global levels to the eventual point of ensuring only the minimum 
security requirements of each state."

  [Text] The [Libyan] secretary of the General People's 
Committee for Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation 
['Umar Mustafa al-Muntasir] addressed the Non-Aligned 
ministerial conference first addendum. The secretary of the 
General People's Comvittee for Foreign Liaison and International 
Cooperation asserted that since the holding of the 10th summit 
conference in Jakarta in 1992, the world has been witnessing 
quick and successive developments and changes with long terms 
effects on international relations on both regional and 
international levels including the non-alignment movement as new 
economic and political trends emerge requiring our countries to 
study them thoroughly and take the necessary initiatives to deal 
with them. 
  He pointed out that the changes which took place in he world 
did not end or lessen the validity of the fundamental principles 
and objectives of the movement. 
  He added "the ideal international order as invisaged by the 
founder fathers of our movement is still far from achieving and 
that the aspirations of the non-alignment movement countries for 
real equality, genuine independence and limited development 
continue to clash with the forces who have been accustomed to 
achieve their intentions without any due regard for the opinion 
and desires of the international community and the U.N 
resolutions. 
  He said against these challenges and the absence of 
international balance, the non-alignment movement continue to 
represent the appropriate framework for the coordination for the 
policy of its members so as to achieve their aspirations, common 
action to maintain their sovereign independence and confronting 
the tendencies of new domination and the imposition of the will 
of the major powers on the whole world. 
  He added "our movement will not oe able to fulfil its whole 
role except through the enhancement of its unity, rejection of 
any attempt to marginalize the role of the movement in 
international affairs and to work actively to prevent the 
establishment of a descriminator of international order which 
would serve only the interest of the northern countries at the 
expense of the interest of the south. We are required to find 
the necessary means and ways to maintain the power of impetus 
within the non-alignment movement so as to fulfil its total role 
in formulating the new international relations and influence 
them in a manner commensurate with its size and its political 
and demographic weight and to contribute towards creating a new 
multilateral world free from domination and founded on 
cooperation, justice, equity, equality and respect for the 
sovereignty of other states. 
  The secretary of the General People's Committe for Foreign 
Liaison and International Cooperation made clear that during the 
10th summit of the non-aligned movement, the delegation of the 
Great Jamahirya was given tpe opportunity to inform the head of 
states of the latest developments in the despute between herself 
and the United States of America, Britain and France. 
  He said "my country expressed deep satisfaction towards the 
stance taken by the movement regarding this dispute as the 
summit welcomed Libya's acceptance of the Security Council 
Resolution 731 and requested the concerned parties to refrain 
from any escalation of the crisis and seek to find a peaceful 
and just settlement which may safeguard the interest and rights 
of all parties in accordance with the norms and principles of 
international law and the U.N. charter. Other organizations 
took a similar stance and I refer in this respect to the O.A.U. 
which adopted in its recent summit in Cairo a decision 
expressing her gratitude to the Libyan initiatives to settle the 
dispute in a manner which respects the sovereignty of Libya in 
accordance to internatinal norms and Libya's acceptance of the 
Security Council Resolution 731 and its request to the U.N 
Secretary General to set up a [word indistinct] for the 
implementation of the resolution. Also the heads of state 
expressed their gratitude to Libya's readiness to cooperate with 
judicial and legal parties. A similar decision was taken by the 
Islamic Conference Organization. 
  The secretary added "in this respect I would like to refer 
the Arab League Resolution No 5373 on 27/3/1994 regarding the 
trial of the two suspects at the seat of the International Court 
of Justice in The Hague. The resolution urged the Security 
Council to take into consideration this new proposal which 
represents an approriate basis to finding a peaceful eolution 
which may satisfy all the varties and prevent any escalation of 
the situation which may highten tension in the region. 
  The Secretary of the General People's Committee for Foreign 
Liaison and International Cooperation said "and here my country 
declares once again her acceptance the aforementioned proposal 
of the League of Arab States as a practical bases to finding a 
final solution to this dispute which is in our opinion enough to 
reach a solution if these countries had sicncere intentions and 
the firm desire for a solution to this issue. 
  He added "we are confident that this conference will support 
the initiative of the Arab League and urge the Security Council 
to respond to it. We rely on the efforts and endeavours of the 
non-aligned movement to convience the concerned countries to 
accept the proposal of the Arab League and abandon efforts to 
impose further sanctions which will only add to the suffering to 
the Libyan Arab people and neighbouring peoples who suffered 
massive losses as a resultpof the unjust, sanctions of the 
Secuirty Council resolutions 748 and 883 and the lifting of 
abroagating of these sanctions. The U.N. is one of the biggest 
centers for coordinating international which the recent changes 
are reflected. However the dominatin of a given geographical 
area in the running of the affairs of the organization with the 
aim to impose its opinion in various important issues led to a 
further [word indistinct] of the developing countries 
spear-headed by the non-alignment movement. This emerged 
clearly during the debates of the security council on a number 
of issues. And there are moves which emerged indeed and warn of 
the desire to take similar measures at the U.N. General 
Assembly. This shows clearly the danger threatening the 
democratic character of the U.N. which has [word indistinct] 
since its establishment, safeguarded by the third world 
membership and its effective participation in its activities. 
These recent developments inside the U.N. are similar to the 
crisis facing the non-aligned movement countries. Our movement, 
being the biggest international grouping after the U.N., was 
able in the past thanks to the balanced democratic debates to 
pave the way for the U.N. to take important political, economic 
and social resolutions. 
  The secretary asserted "the member states of the movement 
should make sure to play fundamental role in the formulation in 
the future U.N. and its restructuring instead of accepting to be 
on the fringe of events and for the movement to take all 
effective measures to confront the current challenges. 
  The secretary added "to realize this objective, we have to 
seek to enhance the U.N. machinery and redirect its activities 
in an effective manner so that all countries will be able to 
participate in the process of the decisions taken by the 
organization and take part effectively in the multilateral 
diplomacy which the U.N. is considered to be its axis and for us 
to be able to create a new order founded on freedom, equality, 
justike, prosperity and the well being of all mankind. 
  The secretary refered once again to the injustice of the 
so-called veto right within the security council enjoyed by five 
countries from a total of 184 member states of the U.N. 
  He pointed out "unfortunately this privilage was abused in 
many circumstances to entrench aggression and terrorizing 
smaller nations and the application of double standards in 
dealing with many issues affecting the maintenance of peace and 
security. 
  He added "in this respect I would like to stress Section 32 
the decision of the Jakarta Summit which asserts the need for 
revising this right in conformity with reforming the U.N. and 
demand a review of the Security Council membership so as to 
reflect the increasing number of the U.N membership and help 
finding fairer and more balanced representation of the U.N. 
members also I would like to reiterate the report of the 
miniserial committee on policy submitted to Jakarta Summit 
stressing the need for effective coordination of the stances of 
the movement before and after the convening of the General 
Assembly especially regarding the issues on which the movement 
took decisions. Furthermore, it is necessary for the decisons 
taken by the summit and ministerial conferences to reflect their 
true effect by members of the movement within the security 
council so as to give it the necessary credibility.
