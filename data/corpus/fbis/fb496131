  [Text] Cairo, June 2, IRNA -- Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali 
Akbar Velayati here Wednesday [1 June] discussed bilateral, 
regional and international issues in separate meetings with his 
Kuwaiti, Syrian and Indian counterparts. 
  Velayati, who is here to attend the four-day Non-Aligned 
Movement (NAM) ministerial meeting, and his Kuwaiti counterpart, 
Shaykh sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, in a meeting stressed the 
importance of bilateral relations as well as speeding up of the 
formation of Iran-Kuwait joint economic commission. 
  Describing the recent visit of a group of Kuwati University 
professors and journalists to Tehran as "positive", Velayati 
said that it could pave the way for further enhancing mutual 
understanding between the two countries. 
  He also referred to the Kuwait-Iraq relations and expressed 
hope that the two can find peaceful ways to solve their border 
disputes by preventing further interference of the foreign 
powers in the region. 
  Pointing out to the latest developments in Kuwait-Iraq 
relations, Al-Sabah stressed the need for full implementation of 
the U.N. Security Council's resolutions on Iraq. He also 
expressed willingness to visit Iran in a near future to explore 
avenues for further promotion of bilateral ties. 
  Meanwhile, in another meeting Velayati and his Syrian 
counterpart Faruq al-Shar' stressed the need for holding the 
tripartite meeting by Iran, Syria and Turkey due to be held in 
Damascus next summer. 
  The two sides also exchanged views on the issue of Palestine 
and the expansionist policies of the Zionist regime. 
  Earlier in the day, Velayati met with his Indian counterpart 
Dinesh Singh and discussed Tehran-New Delhi relations, latest 
developments in Kashmir and the issues pertaining the NAM 
meeting. 
  Velayati arrived here last Monday heading a ranking 
delegation.

  [Text] Cairo, 1 Jun (MENA) -- Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad 
al-Sabah, Kuwaiti deputy prime minister and foreign minister, 
and Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati met this 
evening on the sideline of the ministerial Non-Aligned 
Conference in Cairo. 
  Shaykh al-Sabah said they exchanged views on a number of 
issues, including Iraq-Kuwait relations and the ties between 
Kuwait and Iran, which he described as good. 
  He noted that the Iranian president invited Shaykh Jabir 
al-Ahmad, amir of Kuwait, to visit Tehran. He said the visit 
will take place very soon. 
  When asked about the altercation between the Kuwaiti and 
Iraqi delegations today, Shaykh al-Sabah said the Kuwaiti 
delegation was replying to the remarks of the Iraqi delegation 
concerning the Security Council resolutions that Kuwait, along 
with the entire world, demands be implemented. Regrettably, he 
said, Iraq always says that it closed the file the Kuwait issue. 
  If Iraq really means that, the Kuwaiti minister said, then 
the Iraqi Government and National Assembly should send an 
official document to the Security Council telling it that they 
accept all its resolutions. 
  He denied any Egyptian mediation to improve relations 
between 
Iraq and Kuwait. 
  The Iranian foreign minister was asked about Iran's future 
relations with the PLO in light of Iran's opposition to the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement. He replied that the PLO still 
operates its embassy in Tehran, and that the Iranian Government 
has good ties with the various Palestinian factions. He said 
his country is sympathetic toward the Palestinian cause, and it 
closed the Israeli embassy and replaced it with an embassy for 
Palestine. 
  Velayati said there are plans for the presidents of Iran and 
Syria to meet in Damascus in July to discuss regional and 
international issues of mutual concern. The presidents will 
also discuss the situation in northern Iraq, which is called the 
Kurdish region, he said.

  [Text] Cairo, 1 Jun (MENA) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq 
al-Shar' and Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati met in 
Cairo this afternoon on the sidelines of the 11th Non-Aligned 
ministerial conference. 
  Velayati told reporters after the one-hour meeting that the 
talks were good and constructive, and that they discussed 
bilateral relations and the topics on the agenda of the 
non-aligned conference. 
  He said they also discussed the subjects that will be 
brought 
before the next meeting in Damascus attended by Syria, Turkey 
and Iran at the end of July concerning the situation in northern 
Iraq. 
  Velayati said he will meet with his Kuwaiti counterpart 
Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, and will take part in the 
meeting of the liaison group of the Islamic Conference 
Organization on Bosnia. 
  For his part, Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' said 
after the meeting that he and Velayati discussed bilateral 
relations and a number of issues of mutual concern. He 
described the Syrian-Iranian relations as cordial and said the 
two countries are exchanging views. 
  Al-Shar' said it is intended to hold a summit meeting among 
the presidents of Syria, Turkey, and Iran in Damascus in July to 
discuss ties and issues of common concern. 
  On the Middle East peace process, al-Shar' said no progress 
has been made in the Syrian-Israeli negotiations because of 
Israel's intransigence. There is no peace between Israel and 
Syria now, he said. 
  Asked about Israel's abduction of Lebanese resistance leader 
Mustafa al-Dirani, the Syrian minister said this is an act of 
piracy and terrorism. He said the abduction is a violation of 
Lebanese sovereignty and an act of international terrorism. He 
said resistance in southern Lebanon is a legitimate right which 
Syria supports.

  [Text] Cairo, 1 Jun (MENA) -- Omani Minister of State for 
Foreign Affairs Yusuf Bin-'Alawi Bin-'Abdallah has said that his 
country and Iran will work together to establish peace and 
stability in the Gulf region. 
  Following his meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali 
Akbar Velayati today, Bin-'Alawi told MENA that he and the 
Iranian minister discussed several important issues, including 
the situation in Yemen, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the Gulf region 
in addition to bilateral ties. 
  Touching on the Gulf security arrangements, Bin-'Alawi 
explained that this issue was not discussed during the meeting. 
Our stance is clear in this connection, he said, noting that 
his meeting with the Iranian minister focused primarily on the 
issues included on the agenda of the Non-Aligned Movement 
Conference. 
  The Omani state minister emphasized that a cease-fire in 
Yemen will give Yemenis the chance to return to negotiations and 
decide their country's future. 
  Replying to a question on relations between the Sultanate of 
Oman and Israel, Bin-'Alawi said that there are no relations 
between his country and Israel and that the Israeli delegation 
that visited Muscat recently only took part in the multilateral 
negotiations. This does not mean that there are Omani-Israeli 
relations, he said. 
  I clearly explained that the establishment of such relations 
in the future means that Israel will have to withdraw from all 
the occupied Arab territories and that a comprehensive peace 
will have to be established between Israel and all Arab states, 
he said.

  [Text] [Iraqi] Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf 
met in Cairo yesterday with Algerian Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Mohamed Salah Dembri. The foreign minister briefed the Algerian 
minister on the positive atmosphere and stands that have emerged 
on the part of most of the members of the Security Council, thus 
confirming Iraq's sound position and its call on the council to 
fulfill its obligations in Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687, after 
Iraq has fulfilled all its international obligations toward it. 
  They also discussed issues related to joint Arab action and 
Arab developments, in addition to relations between Iraq and 
Algeria. 
  Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf also met with 
Qatari Foreign Minister Shaykh Jasim Bin-Hamd Al Thani. He 
briefed him on Iraqi ties with the United Nations and the UN 
Special Commission, and the fact that there is now a large 
circle calling for lifting the unjust blockade imposed on Iraq, 
represented in some Security Council members and the 
international community in general. 
  During the meeting, they discussed brotherly relations 
between the two countries. 
  During the two meetings, the Algerian and Qatari foreign 
ministers reiterated their countries' constant position calling 
for lifting the blockade on the Iraqi people, especially since 
Iraq has implemented its obligations per Security Council 
Resolution 687 and cooperated fully with the Security Council 
and the Special Commission. 
  Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf is currently 
visiting Cairo to attend the meetings of the foreign ministers 
of the Non-Aligned Movement. 
  The foreign minister also met in Cairo with the foreign 
minister of Rwanda who reviewed the motives for foreign -- 
especially U.S. -- intervention in his country. 
  The Rwandan foreign minister said the United States seeks to 
impose its hegemony on Rwanda and appoint its agents in the 
region as part of a plan to strike at international liberation 
movements and use force to impose a fait accompli in 
contradiction to the aspirations of nations. 
  The foreign minister briefed his Rwandan counterpart on 
Iraq's efforts at the Security Council to have the unjust 
blockade lifted and on the positive indications that started to 
emerge within the council. 
  The Rwandan foreign minister praised Iraq's principled stand 
in the face of U.S. hegemony and its resistance to all kinds of 
aggression, as well as its people's steadfastness in the face of 
the unjust blockade. 
  The Republic of Rwanda is a member of the Security Council 
in 
its current session. It had called for lifting the Iraq 
blockade at the council.

  [Text] Another two volleys of Katyusha rockets were fired 
over the past hour at the western Galilee and at south Lebanon's 
security zone. This was reported by correspondents Yo'av Aviv 
and Nati Zilberman. The first barrage was launched at the same 
area approximately two hours ago. There were no casualties or 
damage in any of the three barrages. IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] artillery shelled the sites from where the rockets were 
fired. Life continues normally in the western Galilee.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay </F>
Gur by Razi Barqay; place not given -- live] 
  [Text] [Barqay] Good day Deputy Defense Minister 
Mordekhay Gur. 
  [Gur] Good afternoon. 
  [Barqay] Have we gone back to a succession of attacks and 
counterattacks? 
  [Gur] Listen, Hizballah never halted its attacks for even 
one moment, day or night. Fortunately for us, some of their 
activities fail and the Israeli public never learns about them. 
Our soldiers, however, have to suffer them on a permanent 
basis. Therefore, we will strike back at them with all the 
measures at our disposal. 
  [Barqay] Have they, in other words, failed from the very 
beginning to uphold the famous agreement not to fire Katyushas. 
  [Gur] They kept the agreement and so did we. The agreement 
stipulated that Israel would not shell civilian areas and they 
would not shell Israel's borders. We did not fire at any 
civilian settlement. We operate against Hizballah in the 
framework of the understandings reached after Operation 
Accountability [late July 1993]. Today's launching of Katyusha 
rockets at Israel was definitely a provocative act by Hizballah 
which contravenes the agreement and we will have to examine how 
to deal with this matter. 
  [Barqay] In other words, Mordekhay Gur, today's air force 
raid did not infringe upon the understandings? 
  [Gur] Definitely not, today's attack on enemy targets 
without harming civilians is within the parameters of our rights 
as part of the war currently being waged there. The attack was 
directed purely, completely, and fully against enemy soldiers 
belonging to Hizballah. Each one of these soldiers had either 
participated in operations against Israel already, or was 
preparing to participate in such attacks in the near future. 
Therefore, this was a pure military operation which scored an 
impressive success. 
  [Barqay] Did we have prior intelligence information that 
dozens of Hizballah personnel would be meeting there? 
  [Gur] You surely do not expect me to give you an 
intelligence briefing now. I can only recommend that all the 
Arab armies, especially Lebanon and Syria, take a good look at 
how the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] performs not only at 
roadblocks or during occasional and regrettable incidents, but 
rather when it decides to act and concentrates its capabilities, 
know how, intelligence, and technology. When that happens the 
IDF knows how to win and it will always emerge victorious. 
  [Barqay] Tzomet leader Refa'el Eytan has proposed expanding 
the security zone to preclude the launching of Katyusha rockets. 
  [Gur] First of all, the Katyusha rockets could always have a 
longer range. Second, they can move in long-range artillery and 
there is no limit to this. I see absolutely no point in 
expanding the security zone. What I most certainly hope for is 
that both the Lebanese and the Syrians stop placing obstacles on 
the road to peace with Lebanon. The Syrians must also 
understand that the time has come for Lebanon, and its citizens 
in the southern part of the country, to enjoy some peace. Our 
citizens in the north also deserve to have some calm and 
tranquility. This could become achievable within a very short 
time if the Syrians and Iranians stopped preventing the Lebanese 
from reaching an agreement with us. 
  [Barqay] Do the Katyusha barrages obligate Israel to react? 
Perhaps even a ground offensive? 
  [Gur] I leave that for the government to decide. 
  [Barqay] But you said that the Katyushas constituted a gross 
violation of the agreement. 
  [Gur] Undoubtedly. 
  [Barqay] So the region is going to heat up? 
  [Gur] I did not say what will happen there because Israel 
reserves its freedom of action. Last night's operation achieved 
tremendous results. Now we can carefully examine what we have 
to do. There is no rush. We are not making off the cuff 
decisions. We are acting according to the clear and supreme 
security interests of the State of Israel. 
  [Barqay] Did we inform the United States in advance of the 
operation? 
  [Gur] Permit me to ignore any political questions connected 
to this affair. 
  [Barqay] Did we receive any negative feedback from the 
Americans following the operation? 
  [Gur] Not that I know of. Perhaps it is still early. The 
entire world knows about Hizballah's activities and is aware of 
the support the organization receives from Syria and Iran. The 
reaction coming in corresponds to this. The entire world 
recognizes Israel's right to protect its sovereignty and enable 
its citizens along the northern border to live in peace. 
  [Barqay] Thank you, Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>
  [Excerpt] Israel promised the PLO that the Palestinian 
institutions in Jerusalem will continue to exist and operate in 
an orderly fashion. This pledge was made in a letter sent by 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres several months ago to former 
Norwegian Foreign Minister Holst, who was to convey the letter 
to PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat. 
  In the letter, Peres quoted from his Knesset address of 9 
September 1993, in which he said that Israel would be committed 
to the "orderly functioning of the various religious 
institutions which exist and operate in the city" and that 
"coexistence in Jerusalem is a matter of mutual respect among 
all its residents and of the orderly functioning of the relevant 
institutions and systems." Peres noted the "social, religious, 
and other institutions" of each ethnic community in the city, as 
well as the existence of each ethnic community's separate 
educational system. 
  'Arafat asked Israel for the letter in order to preserve the 
political status quo in Jerusalem in anticipation of the 
discussions on the city's status in the course of the permanent 
arrangement negotiations due to begin in about two years. In 
response to his request, Israel sent the letter several weeks 
after the Declaration of Principles [DOP] was signed in 
Washington. 
  The letter's existence and contents were kept secret, and it 
was not publicized along with other documents attached to the 
Israeli- PLO agreements. 
  A senior political element associated with the peace talks 
said yesterday that "the agreements with the PLO contain no 
secret addenda or secret letters. There is nothing secret in a 
speech delivered at the Knesset. We did not try to hide the 
letter, but no one asked us to make its content publics." 
According to this source, "'Arafat did not say that his 
recognition of Israel and the signing of the DOP were contingent 
on the receipt of a letter concerning Jerusalem." 
  The senior political element said that the letter received 
by 
'Arafat refers only to Palestinian institutions that operated in 
Jerusalem at the time of Peres' Knesset speech in September. 
According to him, Israel opposes the establishment and operation 
of new Palestinian institutions that are political in nature. 
"We will not touch the existing bodies, but we will not permit 
new ones to be established," he stressed. [passage omitted]

  [Text] If Israel prevents working meetings by French 
diplomats at East Jerusalem's Orient House, France will, in 
reaction, restrict the meetings of its representatives with 
Israeli representatives in Jerusalem. This was made clear by a 
senior French Foreign Ministry official in a meeting held at 
Israel's Embassy in Paris. Our political correspondent 
'Imanu'el Rosen reports that Jerusalem is concerned by the 
increasing Palestinian pressure, exerted through foreign 
countries, for the achievement of a political status in 
Jerusalem.

<F P=106> [Report by Rina Matzliah] </F>
  [Text] Our correspondent Rina Matzliah has learned the 
details of a secret plan drawn up by the settlers in the 
territories, under which they will try to take over two points 
within the autonomy area in Jericho and hold onto them in an 
attempt to foil the arrival of PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat. Our 
correspondent reports from the place where the settlers have 
convened: 
  [Begin Matzliah recording] The heads of the Council of 
Jewish Settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza rented a 
particularly large hall for a particularly large convention in 
which their protest activities for the coming days are being 
presented. Jerusalem and Jericho are the two centers of these 
protest activities. In Jericho the settlers plan to take 
control of two Jewish points: the Na'aran synagogue which, 
contrary to its name, is not located near Kibbutz Na'aran but 
rather inside the autonomy area, and the Hasmonean Palace which 
is also located inside the autonomy area. The settlers intend 
to take control of these two points, to establish facts on the 
ground, and to remain there, as was the case with the ancient 
synagogue in Jericho. 
  A large-scale protest is planned for Jerusalem too. The 
heads of the council are negotiating with businessmen in 
Jerusalem in an attempt to stage a general strike there on the 
day Yasir 'Arafat arrives in the area. Most importantly, do not 
dare let the PLO leader climb Temple Mount. [end recording]

  [Text] In the wake of the implementation of the autonomy 
agreement, Israel will stop financing busywork jobs for 
Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Security sources noted that in 
May Israel employed 18,000 Gazans in busywork jobs at a cost of 
20 million shekels. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that 
Faysal al-Husayni announced that the Palestinians would shortly 
have enough money to finance the expenses stemming from the 
implementation of the Gaza- Jericho agreement. 
  The Agriculture Ministry will immediately proceed to set up 
a 
special unit to oversee the passage of produce from the autonomy 
to Israel. The unit will tighten controls on shipments of 
produce from the territories to the ultra-Orthodox community. 
Our correspondent Shulamit Schmerling reports that the decision 
to establish the unit already at this point was made at a 
special meeting with the agriculture minister in a bid to curb 
the smuggling of produce by taking advantage of the permits 
given to the ultra-Orthodox community which is currently 
observing a ritual fallow year. Originally, the unit was 
scheduled to be established only after the opening of the 
borders with the autonomy to the passage of produce.

  [Text] Yoram Lizovsky, chairman of the Israel Manufacturers 
Association, has divulged that PLO political elements are 
demanding that foreign companies wanting to maintain business 
relations with the Palestinians refrain from cooperating with 
Israel. Mr. Lizovsky also was disappointed and concerned about 
the decision of PLO political elements not to involve Israeli 
companies in investments in the autonomous area. Our 
correspondent Yafa Glick reports that Mr. Lizovsky, addressing 
the Ra'ananna Economic Club, noted that the only benefit that 
the Israeli economy is reaping from the political process is an 
increase in the number of foreign economic delegations coming to 
Israel.

  [Text] Agriculture Minister Ya'aqov Tzur has decided to 
delay the opening of Israel's borders for free passage of 
agricultural produce from the autonomy until satisfactory 
compensation is provided to Israeli farmers. 
  According to the agreement, the borders were to open this 
week for free passage of fruit, vegetables, cattle, and flocks 
-- apart from poultry -- eggs, tomatoes, cucumbers, and 
potatoes, which will gradually be allowed in under quotas. The 
Ministry of Agriculture is to approve the import of vegetables 
from the Gaza Strip into Israel in a few days time. Tests show 
there is no danger in the vegetables and the farmers there do 
not use pesticides. Agriculture Minister Ya'aqov Tzur is to 
instruct the ministry to publish all information concerning 
laboratory tests on agricultural produce as of tomorrow. 
Recently, tests of fruit and vegetables showed the remnants of 
dangerous pesticides have been found in several Israeli 
agricultural products. The contaminated produce was destroyed 
and the farmers were fined.

  [Text] The organization Peace Watch claims that Israel has 
violated the autonomy agreement signed in Cairo by limiting the 
entry of agricultural products from Gaza into Israel. The 
independent watch-dog group said the eighth paragraph in the 
fourth appendix calls for free passage to markets. 
  Israel has limited the entrance of agricultural products 
from 
the autonomous area until proper compensation is arranged for 
Israeli producers and until quality control for agricultural 
products and livestock are ensured. A joint Israeli-Palestinian 
committee has been set up to deal with the matter.

concluded that reserves soldier Shlomo Shitrit, who was killed 
on the edge of the Gaza Strip earlier this week, was 
accidentally shot by another soldier. Qol Yisra'el's military 
reporter Karmela Menashe says that in contrast to initial 
reports, soldiers did not come under terrorist fire and it 
transpires there were irregularities in the way the troops acted. 
  Reserves soldiers serving on the border of the Gaza Strip 
met 
with the head of Army Southern Command, Major General Matan 
Vilna'i, this week and complained of uncertainty about the new 
situation and lack of equipment.

  [Text] The Labor Central Committee approved by a decisive 
majority the appointment of Knesset Member [MK] Efrayim Sne as 
health minister. Prime Minister Rabin said that in view of the 
difficult situation, Israel needs a full-time health minister. 
There is nobody to talk to in the Histadrut Labor Federation and 
its Kupat Holim health fund is bankrupt. Mr. Rabin said the two 
other ministerial portfolios are being saved for SHAS [Torah 
Observing Sephardim]. Our correspondent Shmu'el Tal reports 
that a minister without portfolio, either Yosi Beilin or MK 
Avraham Burg, is also expected to be appointed. 
  MK Sne thanked the Central Committee for its support and 
called on Kupat Holim Director General Avigdor Kaplan to remain 
in his post and participate in the efforts to rehabilitate the 
fund.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Gadi Sukenik] </F>
  [Text] Ethiopia threatens to expel and detain thousands of 
the Falash-Mura who are crowding the Israeli Embassy in Addis 
Abeba. The official in charge of emigration in Ethiopia 
anticipates that the continued transfer to Israel of those 
claiming to be Falash-Mura will result in an incident between 
the two countries and in a political crisis in Ethiopia. These 
details are included in telegrams which were sent to Israel this 
week from the embassy in Ethiopia and which reached our 
political correspondent Gadi Sukenik, as follows: 
  A few days ago Uri Noy, Israel's ambassador in Ethiopia, was 
sent to a closed meeting with the inspector general of 
Ethiopia's police who is also responsible for prisons and 
emigration from that country. At the meeting our ambassador 
asked that the number of Falash-Mura who want to unite with 
their Jewish brethren in Israel be increased from 80 to 200 per 
month. The ambassador also asked that the mechanism for sorting 
them out in the capital, Addis Ababa, and in Ethiopia's northern 
districts be expanded, at a time when thousands of Falash-Mura 
are already knocking on the Addis Ababa embassy's doors and 
rumors lead many others to flow into the capital from the north. 
  Reports about the meeting which reached Jerusalem and us 
indicate that (Hasan Shifa'), a senior Ethiopian official, 
believes this is a very sensitive issue which may, and I quote, 
harm Ethiopian integration and cause his country to 
disintegrate. He claims that such organized emigration runs 
counter to his government's policy and will turn northern 
Ethiopia into another Israeli district. If this issue becomes 
the focus of interest, it will explode due to its sensitivity. 
In his opinion, the transfer of Jews from Ethiopia to Israel is 
over, and the decision on family reunions is erroneous and will 
culminate in a disaster. The official in charge of emigration 
told Israel's ambassador that by Israel's criteria, all northern 
Ethiopia residents, including even himself, are entitled to 
immigrate to Israel. In short, the Ethiopians turned down all 
the ambassador's requests. In another telegram to Jerusalem, 
Uri Noy recommended that the smaller quota of immigration remain 
and that very low-profile treatment be accorded those awaiting 
immigration outside the capital. 
  [Later in the newsreel Immigrant Absorption Minister Ya'ir 
Tzaban reacts to the above report, saying that "the sensational 
preoccupation with the Falash-Mura problem makes it very 
difficult for the government to implement its decision to bring 
them to Israel as part of its family reunion plan. Those who do 
not respect the Ethiopian Government's sensitivity about this 
complex affair may foil the humanitarian solution of this 
problem."]

  Following his meeting today with President al-Hirawi, Milhim 
Karam, doyen of the newspaper editors, cited the president as 
saying that while Lebanon was following up on its complaint to 
the United Nations over the Israeli piracy of Lebanese water, it 
was hit by a new aggression that demolishes all the Israeli 
excuses and pretexts. The president stressed that Lebanon will 
proceed with the complaint on the theft of Lebanese water to 
ascertain the extent of this piracy. 
  Karam added that President al-Hirawi mentioned that three 
brigades from the Lebanese Army will start a deployment in the 
al-Shuf and 'Alayh Districts on 15 June to ensure the return of 
the displaced persons.

  [Excerpt] As far as Israel and Washington are concerned, 
the importance of al-Hajj Mustafa al-Dirani, who was kidnapped 
by Israel from his home in Qasr Naba, is that he was the 
official in charge of Central Security in the Amal Movement 
before he left it in 1988 and joined the "Faithful Resistance" 
[al-muqawamah al-mu'minah]. 
  More specifically, he is important because the elements 
under 
his command were the ones who arrested Israeli pilot Ron Arad in 
1986 after his military aircraft was shot down during an air 
raid near Sidon. The pilot remained in al-Dirani's custody for 
a period of time. 
  According to informed sources, Washington had prior 
knowledge 
of the kidnapping operation and encouraged it, provided that it 
was a "clean operation." Washington is interested in al-Hajj 
al-Dirani for one reason: He is accused, while he was an Amal 
official, of smuggling in his car U.S. intelligence officer 
William Higgins after he was kidnapped on 17 February 1988 and 
handing him over to the party that announced his execution in 
1989, a few days after Israel carried out a commando operation 
in Jibshit in which it kidnapped Shaykh 'Abd-al-Karim 'Ubayd. 
(At that time AL-SHIRA' published information indicating that 
Higgins was dead before Hizballah announced that it had executed 
him.) [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [News conference by Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz with </F>
unidentified correspondents at Beirut Airport on 1 
June--recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Buwayz] For us, the return of the permanent 
headquarters of ESCWA [UN Economic and Social Commission for 
Western Asia] to Beirut is an important issue. Lebanon was the 
seat of this organization before the Lebanese incidents broke 
out. This organization employs a large number of experts as well 
as locals. Lebanon can benefit from those employees, from the 
conferences to be held by this organization, and from the 
studies it will make for the Lebanese state and institutions. 
The decision to return ESCWA to Beirut was not an easy one, and 
it required a secret vote. However, I believe that Lebanon is 
entitled to repatriate this organization since it can provide 
the academic, scientific, and cultural atmosphere needed for its 
work. 
  [Correspondent] A report by the UN accuses Israel of 
stealing 
Lebanese waters, as is known. What will Lebanon do about it? 
  [Buwayz] This is a very delicate matter. We have repeatedly 
asked the UN and a number of organizations to thoroughly verify 
the matter. I cannot say as yet that we have proof that there 
is direct stealing of water in the south. So far, we have not 
had any clear reports pointing to that direction. The term 
stealing of water can be interpreted in various ways. First we 
have to define if we are talking about subterranean or surface 
water, underground water or river basins, rivers that originate 
and pour its water onto Lebanese territory or rivers that 
originate in Lebanon and flow into other territory. I believe 
that a careful examination of this matter is essential before 
taking any decision about it. 
  [Correspondent] The report mentioned the al-Litani and 
al-Wazzani rivers in particular. 
  [Buwayz] We will study this file thoroughly and we will act 
accordingly. 
  [Correspondent] Reports say that an informal meeting of the 
Security Council will be held to discuss Lebanon's complaint 
against Israel. What can you tell us about Lebanon's activity 
in this regard? 
  [Buwayz] As you know, despite the suspicions we have about 
the Security Council's treatment of the Israeli operation in 
Lebanon [to kidnap Faithful Resistance leader Mustafa 
al-Dirani], we wanted the Security Council to live up to its 
responsibilities. We hope that the Security Council will prove 
that it is still in existence, fair, and still reflects 
international justice. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Part one of an "exclusive" two-part interview with Shaykh </F>
Muhammad Mahdi Shams-al-Din, Chairman of the Higher Islamic 
Shiite Council, in Lebanon by unidentified ETTELA'AT 
correspondent; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [ETTELA'AT] Can you clarify 
the effects of the imposed peace in the Middle East and the 
negligent attitude of some governments toward confronting the 
effects of this imposed war in the Middle East? 
  [Shams al-Din] [passage omitted] We have witnessed with 
great 
regret that the Zionist movement has been successful over the 
Arabs and Muslims, though not in an actual war. This is also 
the case regarding our society and ummah. I do not wish to use 
unrealistic or anachronistic terms. In view of the fact that 
the designs of the Zionist movement have been implemented in 
Palestine, we can say that from this angle we have sustained 
defeat. They have completely driven us out of Palestine. 
Similarly, they have pushed us back in all areas, in our 
position in the world; so at present the issue is not just 
Palestine. Therefore, we are not pitted against a victorious 
enemy but we are an ummah who have been beaten back. 
  However, defeat does not mean that we have lost all our 
means 
of defense. I stress that the ummah has not used all its 
offensive resources but has merely suspended the use of its 
means for defense. [passage omitted] 
  Our condition at present is such that the Arab plan has 
failed and the Islamic plan has failed. The only place where 
the Islamic program continues is the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
which is also under an embargo that is being tightened in the 
political, economic, and security fields. I fear that the 
Zionists will drive a wedge thus paving the way for the 
infiltration of the enemy's designs of our ranks. 
  After the Arabs went to Madrid, I studied the pre-Madrid 
period in the light of the Fiqh and the shari'ah and I perceived 
many secondary elements, which cannot be considered primary ones 
in any way. First of all, I noticed that there were many 
unfortunate divisions prevalent in many areas. One was a 
division within the ummah at the political level with regard to 
political beliefs. The other was a dichotomy of interests 
between these forces and the ruling system. On this basis, we 
observe that some systems were facing a split in their ranks. 
[passage omitted] 
  In my opinion, we should study issues that are important and 
of primary interest. We are facing problems ourselves, such as 
the issue of the return of the government of Islam, victory of 
Islam, the application of the Islamic shari'ah and so on. We 
have the problem of Arab unity, of Pan-Arab nationalism, which 
is pressing. There are certain issues which would make the 
present systems appear illegal. 
  We have problems such as democracy and public freedoms; 
these 
are very widespread. From the late 1940's to the 1970's we 
experienced policies of coups d'etat in Arab countries. Saudi 
Arabia was the only exception in this regard. [passage omitted] 
  In principle, whatever is going on at present cannot be 
considered a peace. This is also not a compromise, because we 
define a compromise as when a person has a right to one of two 
disputed things. In such a case, the one who has the most 
relinquishes some of his rights for the sake of peace. What is 
going on now is actually between the rightful owner and a thief. 
This is not compromise, it is theft. 
  Thus, it is incorrect to term this a peace process when it 
is 
based on the retreat of one side. This is a retreat only on the 
part of one side and that is the one which is the rightful 
owner. What is going on now is for the purpose of legislating 
future interests; since it has resulted from domination, this 
form of legislation has no legal basis. 
  Western politicians say that this situation is a reality and 
has evolved this way. We tell them that evil is also a reality 
in this world, but should we bow down to it? We should resist 
it instead. [passage omitted] 
  The fact is that the ummah's struggle against Zionism is not 
a struggle of one generation at one particular time. The 
Zionist plot belongs to a nation which has placed itself in the 
thick of international interests; right from the outset, the 
ummah should fight against it, and it should be considered a 
struggle spanning many generations. 
  A long-term strategy should be formulated; part of this 
strategy is to ignore governments, because this struggle does 
not end with the death of a king or a president. It the battle 
of all the ummah, whether it spans one generation or three 
generations. We should also accept the fact that we will have 
many losses on this path. This is because the plot that we have 
to fight against is not confined to Palestine, but is a 
worldwide plot. 
  This is one of the strategic errors--that is, the Arabs 
thought they could combat Zionist plots in the short term. It 
is for this reason that we state that the ummah should reassert 
itself to combat the Zionist plot, as the ummah is not limited 
to a single generation.

<F P=106> [Second and final part of "exclusive" interview with Shaykh </F>
Muhammad Mahdi Shams-al-Din, chairman of the Higher Islamic 
Shiite Council, in Lebanon by unidentified ETTELA'AT 
correspondent; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [ETTELA'AT] How do you view Iran's role in 
political, economic, and security developments in the Middle 
East? 
  [Shams-al-Din] The Islamic Republic of Iran is one of the 
greater governments of the region and is capable of becoming 
even greater, in view of its population and geographical base. 
There is no doubt that a political role is of foremost 
importance. 
  We are confronting problems that we should be prepared to 
understand so that the region may not experience negative 
developments. We are aware that the region has entered a phase 
that is being characterized by peace operations in the Middle 
East and in the world. As I have said frequently, most of the 
Arab systems have not entered this phase willingly. 
  The Islamic Republic of Iran has not entered this phase and 
has declared its dissatisfaction with what has occurred 
ideologically and politically in the wake of the peace 
operations. Even though the Zionist entity is a regional 
phenomenon, it is an unlawful one. 
  If circumstances were to move toward what is known as peace 
talks, the region would be engulfed in conflicting political 
ideologies. One of these believes in compromise and abiding by 
the results of these talks and the other rejects compromise and 
its results; the last one is mostly prevalent in the Arab world. 
This is because the Islamic movements in the Arab world and in 
part of the non-Arab world contribute to this view and prefer 
this stance. 
  The current phase that is taking shape is placing heavy 
responsibility on the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Arab 
systems. We believe that the Islamic Republic of Iran is 
necessary for the Arab world and vice versa. Therefore, a 
proper policy should be formulated for an appropriate approach 
by the Islamic Republic of Iran toward the realities present in 
the Arab systems. The latter should also have a more suitable 
attitude toward the stance chosen by the Islamic Republic of 
Iran--which should not be construed as inevitable--regarding the 
developments in the Middle East. 
  The stance adopted by Iran is its own choice and is not an 
unavoidable necessity as Iran can adapt to events. However, 
Iran has adopted the harder approach. At this stage, all of us 
should move toward coexistence to attain mutual understanding. 
If we were able to do so, it would be a major achievement. 
  The Iranian stance should be coordinated with Arab needs and 
vice versa so that it can assume a more suitable form. Without 
this equilibrium, an erratic and inappropriate trend will be 
generated on which the Zionists and the West will capitalize. 
They will be able to exploit the Arabs even more and will 
acquire more power to strengthen the embargo against the Islamic 
Republic of Iran. [passage omitted]. 
  I should emphasize that if God grants us success so that we 
are able to achieve conformity between the stances of the Arabs 
and the Islamic Republic of Iran, it will give Iran ample 
opportunity to share in the security of the region and to 
safeguard its own security. This will also enable it to 
minimize the siege that the West is seeking to impose on it. 
  However, if this reciprocal understanding is not achieved, I 
cannot express what ill-omened consequences it will have on the 
security of the Islamic Republic of Iran and on some Arab 
governments. We can also view the economic impact within this 
perspective. If the policies of the two sides are harmonized 
and yield results, the neighboring and non-neighboring countries 
will provide a suitable market for Iran and the Iranian market 
will probably be beneficial for them. This will generate 
reciprocal economic growth for Iran and the Arab governments. 
On this basis, we tell the Arabs that economic cooperation with 
Iran can be one of the most important instruments of resistance 
in the face of Zionist collusion. 
  Iran is capable of preventing the imminent compromise from 
happening, as was the case at the time of the Islamic Revolution 
when Iran created an equilibrium in the region. We are hoping 
for the glad tidings resulting from the closeness between the 
Islamic Republic of Iran and some of the Arab governments, such 
as the monarchies of Morocco and Jordan as well as the Kuwaiti 
Government. 
  We are optimistic that this scope will expand and that all 
the Arab countries will join this trend without exception; we 
have made efforts toward this end in the past. Regardless of 
who initiates this trend, it is hoped that both sides will adopt 
a positive approach toward it. I do not see any other means of 
promoting mutual relations between the Islamic Republic of Iran 
and the Arab world. 
  [ETTELA'AT] In view of the political, economic, and security 
developments in the Middle East, what difficulties do you 
foresee for Islamism and what avenues do you perceive for its 
future growth? 
  [Shams-al-Din] The most important issue for the Arab and 
non- 
Arab Muslims, after that of the Zionist regime, is the Islamic 
movement. This movement is a manifestation of the spirit of the 
ummah, which is a source of strength and power and exists among 
all Islamic nations. Iran is an exception among the Islamic 
movements as it was victorious, and today it is formulating its 
own policies. I can openly assert that whatever goes on outside 
Iran has a spiritual link to Iran. [passage omitted] 
  At its outset, the Islamist movement in Algeria mobilized 
all 
its resources in the elections, which was a mistake. It would 
have been better if it had not projected itself as the foremost 
force in Algeria, and as we mentioned to some of its prominent 
figures, it should have appeared on the scene gradually so that 
the Algerian system would not have risen in confrontation. 
  On the other hand, society was not ready to accept what the 
Islamist movement represented, as such a plan needs time in a 
society such as that of Algeria. It was not the kind of society 
in which the Islamic experiment could be implemented immediately. 
  It is necessary to ponder two topics: One is that only non- 
Islamic governments are against the Islamic movement. In fact, 
some of the nations who are not totally ready for this plan are 
on our side. Our nations are Muslim, and even though the 
experiment of a Western-style government has proved unsuccessful 
for them, this does not mean that they are ready to accept the 
Islamic experiment in view of their current obligations. 
  The other point is that the Islamic movement, with the 
exception of Iran, incorporates a political plan and needs the 
guarantee of a political democracy. It is possible that this 
could be in the form of a real council and not a pyramid-type 
structure. 
  After the Persian Gulf war, we proposed that an open, frank, 
and realistic debate on the negative effects of the 
organizational structure and existing trends in the strategy of 
the Islamic movements be conducted. This is because the Persian 
Gulf crisis underlined the deep problems that exist in the 
larger Islamic movement groups. We perceived that most of these 
problems resulted from the actions of Saddam Husayn, who had 
projected himself as an imam Khomeyni to the world. He tried to 
adopt the imam Khomeyni way of speaking and an approach used by 
Gamal 'Abd-al-Nasir. 
  There were many who were deceived by Saddam's slogans, and 
this caused a disruption in the relations between governments 
and nations with the Islamic movements. [passage omitted] 
  [ETTELA'AT] What is your appraisal of the present and future 
situation in Lebanon in the economic, political, and cultural 
areas? 
  [Shams-al-Din] At present all of us are waiting to see how 
events shape up. Some describe this period as a formative one 
or one of peace resulting from certain developments that are in 
the throes of materializing in the Middle East. In this 
environment, Lebanon is an area that is bound to be affected by 
regional developments, depending on the extent of its 
involvement in these events. In light of the nature of its 
domestic system, it is endowed with more brilliant and numerous 
factors for recovery than other Arab countries. Lebanon does 
not require internal economic changes, as it was the founder of 
a free economy in the region and has enjoyed greater democracy 
than other Arab countries. 
  Another factor that ensures Lebanon's future is the variety 
provided by the presence of Christian and Muslim elements in its 
society. These are factors that lend it a distinctiveness 
compared to other Arab societies. If a plan to set up a system 
in the Middle East region or a proposal for a regional accord 
fails, Lebanon has resources to detach itself from this climate 
or to minimize the negative effects. I believe that, despite 
the presence of a state of political flux and a political crisis 
situation, Lebanon has put the dangerous stage behind it. 
  The conditions are not as bright as the Lebanese Government 
projects, but the current situation will not continue and the 
economic conditions will improve. I would not describe it as 
brilliant but I believe that in the next year we will witness 
better conditions in the Lebanese economy. [passage omitted]

Hasan al-Turabi [leader of the National Islamic Front] is 
personally involved in triggering the civil war in Yemen. The 
same sources say that some time ago al-Turabi met with 
'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani, a representative of the Islamic Reform 
Group; and 'Abd-al-'Aziz Yasin, a representative of the Muslim 
Brotherhood in Yemen. He persuaded them to reject the Pledge 
and Agreement Document signed by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid in Jordan. 
  The sources note that al-Turabi claimed to some Yemeni 
forces 
that the continuing political crisis in Yemen will eventually 
lead those he called "the Islamic forces" to control power both 
in northern and southern Yemen.

  [Excerpts] Khartoum, 1 Jun (KNA/PANA) -- Sudan says it is 
considering taking its dispute with Egypt over Hala'ib border 
area to international arbitration, because a bilateral solution 
seems to have failed. 
  In a press briefing Tuesday [31 May], under secretary of the 
Sudanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs 'Umar Baridu said in 
Khartoum that Sudan would either go to the International Court 
of Justice or an international arbitration committee. 
  "We think it is possible to reach a peaceful solution to 
this 
dispute in a cordial and civilized manner through such a 
mechanism", he said. He cited the example of Libya which 
returned the Aouzou strip to Chad after the international court 
ruled in Chad's favor. [passage omitted] 
  Baridu also described as a "clear violation of Sudanese 
supremacy" Egypt's presence in the area of Arqueen [as 
received]. Arqueen is an area claimed by Sudan in the Lake Nasir 
area formed after the construction of the Aswan High Dam in 
upper Egypt in the 1960's. Sudan, suspicious that Egypt wants 
to annex the area thought to be rich in Nile water fish, claims 
that thousands of Egyptian soldiers have been stationed in the 
area to prevent the intrusion of Sudanese fishermen.

  [Excerpt] President 'Umar al-Bashir returned to Khartoum 
from Vienna yesterday afternoon [31 May] at the end of a two-day 
visit to Austria at the invitation of President Thomas Kestil. 
In his arrival speech, General al-Bashir said he held several 
meetings in Vienna with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni. At 
some of these meetings, which were behind closed doors, the two 
leaders discussed the development of bilateral relations. 
According to President al-Bashir, these meetings were aimed at 
improving relations between the two countries, given Uganda's 
important role in the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and 
Development initiative on restoring peace to southern Sudan. He 
said the two sides agreed to strengthen ties to serve the 
interests of both peoples. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] The Interior Minister Abdallah Kallel has 
announced, when opening the periodic conference of governors 
this morning, that the conference was taking place in an 
atmosphere of tranquillity, security, political, and social 
concord, progress, and economic development, in addition to the 
country's leading role in foreign affairs. 
  The minister of state pointed out the invaluable directives 
in the speech made by President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali on the 
occasion of the swearing-in ceremony of the new Chamber of 
Deputies, in which pluralism was palpable for the first time in 
the history of the country. 
  The minister of state has pointed out, however, that there 
was no more room for anyone to talk in the name of people from 
outside the parliament anymore and asserted the need for 
everyone to pay due respect to the rule of law, be it 
individuals, institutions, or organizations. 
  He pointed out, furthermore, the great importance the 
president was attaching that everyone should address himself to 
seriously work for the building of a pluralist, unified, and 
prosperous society. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Khalid Salah and 'Abd-al-Fattah 'Abd-al-Mun'im] </F>
  [Excerpts] Diya'-al-Din Dawud, secretary general of the 
Nasirite Arab Democratic Party and People's Assembly member, on 
Sunday presented an urgent enquiry to the prime minister and the 
interior minister on the recent incidents in the Lawyers 
Association and the circumstances surrounding the mysterious 
death of lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani. [passage omitted] 
  The incidents at the Lawyers Association continue to draw 
political reactions. Within the attempts of the Muslim 
Brotherhood to avoid a clash with the government--a clash that 
appeared increasingly likely in the past weeks--Muslim 
Brotherhood General Guide Muhammad Hamid Abu-al-Nasr has denied 
any responsibility for his group in stirring up and leading the 
demonstration that was staged by the lawyers a few weeks ago to 
protest the death of lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani hours after 
his arrest late last month. 
  In statements to AL-'ARABI, Abu-al-Nasr said the Muslim 
Brotherhood was falsely blamed for the Lawyers Association 
incidents. He said the Muslim Brotherhood "has nothing to do 
with the associations and does not interfere in their affairs!" 
He explained the attacks on the Muslim Brotherhood in the 
government media as a continuation of statements President 
Mubarak made to the German magazine DER SPIEGEL, in which he 
accused the banned Muslim Brotherhood of supporting terrorism. 
Following those statements by the president, Abu-al-Nasr said, 
the official media "rushed to launch a strong attack against us, 
and even blamed us for the Lawyers Association incidents!" 
  Security forces yesterday arrested five Muslim Brotherhood 
members. They were referred to the prosecution, which decided 
to remand them for two weeks for interrogation.

  [Excerpt] Cairo, 1 Jun (MENA)-- Field Marshal Muhammad 
Husayn Tantawi, minister of defense and war production, said 
that the armed forces are currently undergoing a giant 
modernization process according to annual, five-year, and 
long-term plans that depend on local resources and friendly 
states. 
  Having attended the "Bahir 94" live ammunition maneuvers 
conducted by an armored formation of the 2d Field Army today, 
the defense minister said: We are not developing our armed 
forces to antagonize anybody, because we are at peace with all 
our neighbors. He pointed out that the goal of this 
modernization is to ensure the preparedness of our armed forces 
for accomplishing their task of defending national security. 
  Field Marshal Tantawi said: Our only task in peacetime is to 
train our armed forces cadres to ensure their optimal combat 
efficiency. The more peace is established, the better training 
can be at all levels. 
  We seek to achieve balance between the human element and 
armaments to enable individuals to use modern and sophisticated 
weapons, Tantawi said. He added that the numbers of combat 
elements in the armed forces are currently being increased 
against those working in the service or administrative sectors. 
He affirmed that the numbers of the armed forces will not be 
decreased, emphasizing: We seek to achieve the optimal use of 
available manpower. 
  The defense minister pointed out that there are no plans to 
cut the term of military service for new recruits, noting that 
the armed forces recruit the number of individuals they need. 
He explained that the surplus recruits are absorbed into the 
national service apparatus, which seeks to achieve 
self-sufficiency for the armed forces. 
  Field Marshal Tantawi said that the armed forces have an 
excellent mobilization plan that ensures shifting from a 
condition of peace to one of war in record time. 
  The defense minister called for paying more attention to 
military training, noting that sophisticated armaments need 
first-rate training. We have to stretch the shelf-life of old 
weapons. We have to enhance their efficiency and upgrade them to 
the level of modern weapons, he said. 
  He stressed that commanders and officers of different ranks 
should be given the opportunity to make decisions to cope with 
developments in order to develop their sense of initiative and 
creativity. Tantawi called for enhancing the combat efficiency 
and preparedness of the armed forces and for raising fighters' 
morale through constant training, discipline, and physical 
fitness. 
  The military drill incorporated armored formations from the 
2d Field Army with elements from the Air Force, Air Defense, and 
Electronic and Chemical War and units from the engineering and 
airborne divisions. 
  In the drill, our troops checked a hostile offensive action 
and forced the attacking forces to retreat to the international 
borders, inflicting heavy losses on them. 
  The exercise began with reconnaissance sorties in which our 
troops gathered information on the condition of the hostile 
forces. In the meantime, our forces destroyed hostile aircraft 
that tried to reconnoiter our positions. 
  The (Shilka) and Chaparral antiaircraft missiles were used 
in 
the exercise. This is the first time the firing process has 
been conducted from training aircraft outside the air defense 
firing range. The shooting was conducted under conditions 
identical to those prevailing in a real war. The antiaircraft 
ballistic units dealt with the enemy's armored units to destroy 
them and secure our forces' lines. Our artillery bombarded the 
enemy artillery and silenced their sources. 
  Our aircraft attacked the depth of the enemy defenses to 
destroy its artillery and armored pieces. Our artillery units 
prepared for the advance of the bulk of our troops by constant 
bombardment and smoke screens. 
  Combat units opened gaps in the enemy's mine fields, using 
the Egyptian-made al-Fatih missiles, which proved their high 
efficiency during the Gulf war. Our troops then advanced into 
the depth of the enemy's lines, while our air defenses were 
checking attacks by the enemy's air force using the (Shilka) 
missiles, characterized by the ability to deal with air targets 
while moving. 
  Our artillery succeeded in silencing the enemy's reserve 
artillery deep in the lines by firing long distance. It also 
succeeded in destroying the enemy's armored vehicles, using 
highly-explosive ammunition with the help of antitank 
helicopters. 
  MI-8 helicopters were meanwhile landing paratroopers behind 
the enemy's artillery lines to create a gap in its defenses. A 
Buffalo aircraft loaded with antitank weapons landed on the 
battlefield to replenish our troops' supply of ammunition. 
  Our troops finally managed to control the territory that was 
seized by the enemy, forcing its troops to retreat. [passage

satellite will have between 12 and 56 channels. Al-Sharif hopes 
that work on the project will start before the end of this year 
so that the satellite can be launched by the end of 1996.

  [Text] Cairo, May 31, SPA -- Custodian of the two holy 
mosques, King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz has sent a message to 
president Husni Mubarak of Egypt. 
  The message was handed over by Prince Saud al-Faysal, the 
foreign minister who was received by President Mubarak here on 
Tuesday. 
  Following the meeting, Prince Saud said the message dealt 
with the constant coordination and consultation between the two 
leaders. He termed the meeting as a good opportunity to 
congratulate President Mubarak on the early success of the 
conference of the Non-Aligned Movement which was started in 
Cairo earlier in the day and highlighted the inaugural speech 
delivered by President Mubarak before the opening session. 
  Asked on whether he discussed the Yemen crisis with the 
President Prince Saud said both King Fahd and President Mubarak 
have shown much concern on the painful fighting between the 
Yemeni brothers and they urged the conflicting parties to stop 
fighting with the hope that all concerned parties would respond 
to the appeal. 
  Prince Saud expressed hope that the U.N. Security Council 
would adopt an effective resolution for ceasefire in Yemen and 
added that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia would support any measure 
that would lead to ceasefire and end of the war. 
  Meanwhile, Prince Saud told reporters following the opening 
session of the conference of foreign ministers of non-aligned 
countries of the great importance of the role that should be 
undertaken by the Non-Aligned Movement towards the new 
international developments. 
  Referring to criticism that the role of the Movement has 
been 
diminished and become less effective in international affairs, 
Prince Saud cited remarks made by President Mubarak on the 
matter in his comprehensive speech at the opening session on the 
matter that the role of the Non-Aligned Movement should deal 
dynamically with the new international reality and, that the 
movement should deal with rational and realistic approachs. 
  Citing prospects that the Non-Aligned Movement would 
concentrate on economic affairs rather than political ones, 
prince said the the Group of 77, assigned by the Movement, is 
tackling economic issues. He added that a number of proposals on 
the role of the movement would be discussed in a special session. 
  Prince Saud expressed support for enlargement of the role of 
the Movement in the United Nations on international peace and 
security both in the Security Council and the General Assembly 
to ensure fair handling of international issues. 
  "The problem is not on whether to increase the represenation 
of the Non-Aligned Movement in the Security Council, but matters 
concerning the identification of the Security Council and how it 
should deals with its duties should also be raised." he said.

  [Text] Cairo, 28 May (MENA)--Tunisian Prime Minister Dr. 
Hamed Karoui arrived in Cairo today on a two-day official visit 
to Egypt. 
  On his arrival, Karoui stated that he was carrying a message 
from Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to President 
Muhammad Husni Mubarak. The message is part of the continuous 
consultations between the leaders on bilateral relations, Arab 
and Middle East issues, and the African summit, which is 
scheduled to convene in Tunis in June. 
  Karoui said he will inform President Mubarak of the Tunisian 
president's views and will hear President Mubarak's views on 
African and international issues. 
  Answering a question on the situation in Yemen, he said that 
developments there are regrettable. He added: We were hoping 
to put the Arab house in order, but we haven't lost hope yet. 
We would like the United Nations to resolve this issue despite 
the fact that there are numerous issues that the United Nations 
has not been able to resolve. We hope the brothers in Yemen 
will manage to find a way to unite once again. 
  Karoui refused to comment on the secession of south Yemen. 
He expressed his hope that the Yemenis will find a solution 
amongst themselves. 
  The Tunisian prime minister concluded his statement by 
saying 
that his country will take part in the conference of the 
Nonaligned countries' foreign ministers scheduled to convene in 
Cairo on Tuesday [31 May].

  [Text] Finance Minister Dr. Muhammad al-Razzaz has stated 
that 21.446 billion pounds will be earmarked for servicing the 
internal and external debts in the new budget, which will begin 
on 1 July. Dr. al-Razzaz pointed out that the treasury bills 
make up most of the internal debts owed by the government. He 
stressed the importance of the treasury bills in streamlining 
the budget deficit and absorbing the surplus in the country, 
whether from individuals or banks, to reduce inflation. The 
minister also stressed the importance of the treasury bills in 
stopping the drop in interest rates on savings in Egyptian 
pounds and in maintaining the rates of exchange. 
  Dr. al-Razzaz added that the state is spending 1.5 billion 
pounds to adjust the financial structure of the Egyptian railway 
and 220 millions to extend electricity to the countryside.

  [Text] Cairo, 1 Jun (MENA)-- Egypt and the European 
Investment Bank [EIB] have signed an agreement granting Egypt a 
120-million-pound loan to be allocated completely to private 
small industries. 
  Dr. Yusuf Butrus Ghali, minister of state for international 
cooperation, and EIB Deputy Director Robert Dillon signed the 
agreement. 
  Dr. Ghali pointed out that the agreement is within the 
context of the government's efforts to consolidate the private 
sector and emphasize its crucial role in economic development in 
Egypt. He added that the loan is a significant first step in 
the government's efforts to guarantee the provision of the 
financial instruments needed for developing the private sector, 
like long-term and easy loans to suit small industries employing 
a maximum of 10 workers. He remarked that small industries are 
the backbone of the policy that aims to increase production and 
employment rates.

agreement says that the transgressors will be questioned and 
punished. Quoting eye-witnesses, the Bakhtar Information Agency

fully observed today and the roads leading to western section of

commute unimpeded.

<F P=106> [Address by Afghanistan President Bornahoddin Rabbani at </F>
session of Peace and Islamic Brotherhood Front in Kabul on 1 
June -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Esteemed brothers, esteemed 
president of the Peace and Islamic Brotherhood Front, and others 
in the audience: The peace and blessing of God be upon you. I 
am very happy to take part in your session today. (?You have 
opened) your session as usual; from the beginning, since the 
formation of the Peace and Islamic Brotherhood Front, you have 
been working hard for the restoration of security, prevention of 
disturbances and clashes, and for the consolidation of peace in 
our beloved Islamic country, Afghanistan. 
  You have again opened this grand session with this sacred 
aspiration [passage indistinct]. Under the present circumstances 
yet again we need more action and more efforts, especially from 
our brothers and our esteemed ulema -- those who are aware and 
have honest feelings in particular under the present 
circumstances. We must take faster steps along the road for the 
restoration of peace and security and increase our efforts and 
action. In regard to the current situation and solution of the 
problems, I would like to raise a number of issues with you, 
esteemed brothers [passage indistinct]. 
  Of course you are aware of the political and military 
situation of your country. You know why the fighting flared up? 
Where was the problem? What were the causes of the clashes and 
destruction? I have said time and again, and I emphasize again 
that the Islamic government which is in charge now has not 
grasped power through a military coup and has not usurped 
sovereignty by conspiracy. You know yourself that a number of 
decisions were made prior to the collapse of the previous regime 
in Afghanistan. Decisions were made by the esteemed leaders, a 
number of whom are with us in the present difficulties. A 
number of them as onlookers see the events from far away and a 
number of them are standing in the trench of hostility against 
the Islamic state and their own people and they put Kabul city 
and other regions under their cruel attacks and embark on 
conspiracies, coups and anti-Islamic and anti-national actions. 
[passage omitted] 
  For elections to take place as soon as possible -- we are 
ready for the election to be held. The settlement that was 
reached in Peshawar and various settlements that have been 
reached [words indistinct] that elections should be held on the 
basis of the formation of a new council to make a decision on 
changing political leadership in Afghanistan. At the moment the 
unanimous decision of all -- in all those agreements and in all 
of their undertakings -- is for another council to be convened 
in order that this council can reach a settlement about the 
future [words indistinct]. Here we have some options: One is 
that some people who say that they do not want to convene a 
council and make no undertaking want six or nine people to sit 
together and form another government -- form a transitional 
government for a short time. And after that -- after a 
transitional government is formed another council is to be 
formed. The reality is that their goal is not the formation of a 
transitional government. It is to create a vacuum or an 
inertia, to have a situation come about that the present 
administration -- before such a council is convened that has the 
power of decisionmaking, with all issues be submitted to it, and 
it should represent the whole of Afghanistan -- the regime is 
dismantled before such a council is convened [words indistinct] 
[sentence as heard]. 
  Two or three brothers of ours are not even prepared to come 
inside Afghanistan and sit together. Do they want to set up 
this session outside Afghanistan or do they want to hold it 
along the border? (?Do they care) that Kabul will again be put 
under the rain of rockets? The elements that are lying in wait 
will again cause disorder and embark on plunder and new clashes. 
(?They do not think of this) but only aim to disrupt the 
situation, and whatever happens in the future let it happen; no 
one will be there to take the responsibility. There will be no 
shura [parliament], no government, or any center of 
decisionmaking, nothing, only an imaginary condition and 
illusory situation. A government of transition; what can a 
government of transition do? A government formed through the 
Hal-wa Haqd Shura [constituent council] and a government which 
is formed by their participation, they do not accept this 
government. It is not clear how this transitional government 
will be formed, [words indistinct] who will be in this 
transitional government and for how long. As far as we see, 
such decisions undermine the nation and make them a ground for 
dangerous games [words indistinct]. 
  You are all witness to the fact that (?most of the 
countries), even some countries unfortunately in the east [words 
indistinct], are those who really do not want stability in our 
country. They do not want Afghanistan as a powerful, 
independent, and Islamic country. Nevertheless, the decision 
must be made by our people: What advice do they give and what 
decision do they make? What should we do? What kind of climate 
is to be created so that we can get rid of this situation? This 
decision to set up a shura is the decision of those leaders to 
which they are now disagreeing; all agree to the setting up of a 
shura. But why are they not now agreeing to the setting up of 
this shura; perhaps they say that the government might influence 
it; that is to say that government might select their own chosen 
people [words indistinct]. Such a belief is in fact an insult 
against the people of Afghanistan [words indistinct]. 
  I am prepared for solving their problem, and I believe that 
the government should not interfere in the setting up of a shura 
and should choose a neutral position. Representatives can be 
chosen from among peace delegations, representatives from 
formations or alternatively no representatives should be allowed 
from formations for preventing struggles and conflicts. Let the 
peace delegations [words indistinct] and also representatives 
from those provinces that have jihadi councils, their 
representatives should take part. From among this collection, a 
gathering of fully neutral individuals can come into being. 
This neutral collective should draft regulations for the 
setting up of a shura and convene the shura. When the shura is 
gathered then the government's responsibility [words indistinct] 
should be handed over to this shura as a center of power. The 
shura will have the power to choose the future leadership of 
Afghanistan and take whatever decision they wish. The decision 
of the shura should be respected. We must respect their 
decision. Is it better to let six or seven people sit together 
far away from the country and decide about the country or let a 
thousand or thousand-and-a-half representatives of the people to 
render such a decision [passage indistinct]. 
  Nevertheless, I believe that a way should be sought by the 
people themselves to get rid of this situation; a decision must 
be taken by the representatives of the people. You, esteemed 
ulema and the brothers who are present here and the rest of our 
brothers must consult with each other about the future of our 
country and render a decision representing the will of the 
people. You should render a decision before our country's 
difficulties increase. The government is at your disposal, 
advise it [passage indistinct].

  [Text] Kuwait, 1 Jun -- Douglas Hogg, British minister of 
state for foreign and commonwealth affairs, said that the 
resolution due to be debated by the UN Security Council later 
today concerning Yemen would be useful. 
  In a statement he made to KUNA on his arrival in Kuwait 
today 
from Manama, in the framework of his tour in the region, he 
further said: We are not of the view that the declaration of 
independence by South Yemen will gain recognition. He also said: 
Clearly, Yemenis agree on the need to change the constitutional 
situation in Yemen to bring about a completely different 
situation, but at this moment we recognize one Yemeni state. 
  After a meeting with the Kuwaiti Defense Minister Ahmad 
al-Hamud al-Jabir al-Sabah, the British minister further said: 
We do not believe that time has come to alleviate sanctions 
against Iraq, and this requires Iraq to meet two conditions at 
least. He said that these two conditions were Iraq's 
recognition of the independence and sovereignty of the state of 
Kuwait, and the Kuwaiti-Iraqi borders as demarcated by the UN. 
He also said that amongst the necessary and important 
conditions to alleviate the sanctions is Iraq's heeding of the 
UN Security Council resolutions concerning its arms of mass 
destruction, and its commitment to the measures concerning this. 
Hogg said he believed these requirements would not be met this 
year. 
  Hogg also said that his talks with the Kuwaiti defense 
minister confirmed the British-Kuwaiti common defense and 
strategic interests, noting that Britain was very interested in 
Kuwait's independence and security. 
  He said that the purpose of his visit to Kuwait was to 
discuss numerous issues of common interest with Kuwaiti 
officials. He described British-Kuwaiti relations as being 
excellent. 
  Hogg is expected to hold a meeting tomorrow with Prime 
Minister Shaykh Sa'd al-'Abdullah Al-Salim, the deputy speaker 
of the National Assembly and a number of local and foreign 
businessmen. 
  The British minister will tomorrow afternoon visit Khawr 
Abdullah base where UNIKOM [United Nations Iraq-Kuwait 
Observation Mission] forces are stationed, and will also inspect 
the border demarcation line approved by the UN Security 
Council's resolution 833. The British minister will hold a news 
conference tomorrow afternoon. 
  The Kuwaiti defense minister said that the meeting he held 
with Mr. Hogg dealt with a number of issues, both bilateral and 
regional. 
  Shaykh al-Hamud added that his meeting with the British 
official was the fourth of its kind in three years and hailed 
Britain's support for the Kuwaiti rights through the UN Security 
Council.

  [Excerpts] Ottawa, 29 May (KUNA) -- Ahmad 'Abd-al-Aziz 
Sa'dun, speaker of the National Assembly, has said that Kuwait 
does not fear the emergence of extremist religious movements 
like those that exist in a number of Arab states. 
  In an interview on Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, CBC, 
radio he said that "as long as there is democracy, 
participation, freedom of expression, and a free press," in 
addition to "our open society which allows all sides to be heard 
and to put forward their points of view, this prevents any form 
of extremism." 
  Sa'dun was replying to a question on whether Kuwait fears 
Islamic extremism. He said that Kuwaiti society "adheres to 
religion and abides by Islam, but in this case you are talking 
about political organizations which are actually present 
throughout the Arab homeland." He stated that the present 
National Assembly "represents all strata of Kuwaiti society and 
all political, social, and other groups." 
  He said that there is a trend toward widening the electoral 
base in Kuwait through a number of proposals "which have been on 
the table for some time and on which views differ," such as 
granting women the right to vote, lowering the voting age to 18, 
giving naturalized Kuwaitis the right to vote, and granting the 
right to vote to certain nationals who are resident abroad 
because of the nature of their work, such as ambassadors, 
members of the diplomatic corps, students, and military 
personnel. 
  He said: "We are a democratic country" and accept what is 
adopted by the majority. "Whatever the trend on any of these 
issues, I personally am not concerned when the vote in the 
National Assembly goes against my own preference." [passage 
omitted] 
  The National Assembly speaker said that the greatest 
achievement in Kuwait since its liberation from Iraqi occupation 
has been parliamentary elections and the restoration of 
democracy. He said that this emphasized "the nature of the 
situation in Kuwait, the nature of the ruling system in Kuwait, 
and the nature of the Kuwaiti people, who must have a role in 
managing the affairs of their country and in 
self-determination." [passage omitted]

legitimate international resolutions. 
  The source said that Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad has noted

stance regarding the need to compel Iraq to implement all the 
international resolutions pertaining to the war of liberation 
against Kuwait, stressing that the UN sanctions imposed on the 
Iraqi regime were the only guarantee to achieve this goal.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the "Armed Forces Command of the </F>
Democratic Republic of Yemen"; place and date not given] 
  [Text] In the context of the escalation in the military 
situation and in an open challenge leveled against all the Arab 
and international efforts aimed to bring about an end to the 
fighting in Yemen, the al-Ahmar gang in Sanaa has launched 
missile and air strikes against the residential quarters and 
vital civil installations in Aden. Yesterday at dawn, Aden came 
under a missile attack aimed at civilian residential quarters. 
The missiles were engaged by our air defenses, which shot down 
one of the missiles in flight while another missile fell into 
the sea. This morning two enemy aircraft tried to bomb the 
little Aden refinery, one of the vital and important economic 
installations belonging to our Yemeni people. Our air defenses 
succeeded in foiling this treacherous attempt, which failed to 
achieve its objectives. However, one of the houses of the 
innocent citizens in little Aden was hit, killing a number of 
women and children. The Command of the Armed Forces in the 
Democratic Republic of Yemen, while condemning these barbarous 
acts which violate all the rules of war, reserves the right to 
respond strongly and decisively to this kind of aggression. Let 
those who are warned take heed.

  [Text] A responsible military source has denied reports 
broadcast by the news media of the gang of mutiny and secession 
to the effect that two aircraft belonging to our Armed Forces, 
the forces of unity and legitimacy, fired missiles at the Aden 
oil refinery. The source said these reports are false and 
baseless, and that they constitute an attempt to cover the 
crushing blows inflicted by the heroic Armed Forces men on the 
dens of the secessionist gang inside the Aden Governorate. 
  The source said that the air strikes targeted the camp the 
secessionists are using as a stronghold west of Aden, and that 
the civilian and economic installations and residential areas 
have not been and will never be targets for the forces of unity 
and constitutional legitimacy.

<F P=106> [Statement by a "responsible source at the Command of the </F>
Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Yemen"; date not 
given] 
  [Text] The bloody al-Ahmar gang in Sanaa today repeated to 
fail in its aggressive attempts on the various fronts. Our air, 
ground and naval forces have been able to repel and foil these 
attempts and to rout the hostile forces, inflicting on them 
heavy losses of life and material. On the Karish-Tawr al-Baha 
axis, our forces were able to shoot down two enemy aircraft and 
destroy four Katyusha rocket launching vehicles. On this front 
the enemy lost dozens of officers and men, including a 
lieutenant colonel and a major. In a hysterical attempt, two 
enemy aircraft tried to bomb the Aden refinery, but our air 
defenses foiled them. One of the aircraft released its 
destructive load over one of the government schools in 
al-Burayqah, wounding six women and children living near the 
school. In the Abyan-Shabwah axis our forces continued 
delivering crushing blows on the invading enemy forces, 
compelling them to withdraw and return to where they had come 
from. God is great.

  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister brother 'Abd-al-Wahhab 
al-Anisi has reaffirmed that the war, which was triggered by the 
gang of apostasy and secession in the Yemeni Socialist Party 
leadership, is between the Yemeni people and a mutinous group 
violating the constitutional legitimacy. 
  Referring to the concern of the brothers and friends, as 
well 
as their calls for halting the fighting, he wondered: On what 
basis do they call for a cease-fire, and what are the guarantees 
that the rebels would resort to the constitutional legitimacy 
and its institutions, which were established as a result of the 
general elections that were held on 27 April 1993 and that were 
(?defined) by everybody. 
  The deputy prime minister reiterated our country's rejection 
of any interference in its domestic affairs by the Security 
Council or any other side, stressing that what is taking place 
in the Republic of Yemen is an internal affair. He also voiced 
his surprise at some brothers' insistence on the need for the 
Security Council to issue a resolution on a cease-fire, although 
they know that the issue belongs to the Yemeni people alone. 
Such a resolution, he added, will lead to more fighting, which 
is sought by those who want such a resolution. 
  This came during a news conference he gave at the Prime 
Ministry today. Several representatives of local, Arab, and 
international television networks, radio stations, and press in 
Sanaa attended. It was also attended by 'Abd-al-Rahman Zaydan, 
director of the prime minister's office, and [name indistinct], 
under secretary of the Ministry of Information.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim </F>
Basindwah by Sawsan Abu-Husayn in Cairo; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Abu-Husayn] You said during your recent visit 
to Cairo that what is happening in Yemen is merely a state of 
rebellion and that it would be settled in no more than 48 hours. 
The Yemeni war has now entered its second month. Do you still 
believe it is a state of rebellion and civilian-military 
disobedience? 
  [Basindwah] Yes, what is happening in Yemen is no more than 
a state of rebellion and disobedience. And even though the 
battle has continued for longer than expected, the reason is 
because we did not know that the group of apostasy and secession 
had all the weapons we have just discovered. We did not know 
that it had important strategic bases, which has caused the 
fighting to continue for longer than expected. All this prompts 
us now to say that the group of rebellion had made preparations, 
not for the sake of threatening its opponents in Yemen, but 
maybe for the sake of imposing its hegemony over the region as a 
whole. 
  [Abu-Husayn] What do you mean by that accusation? 
  [Basindwah] The Socialist Party, which is led by al-Bid, 
espoused the popular fronts for the liberation of Gulf states, 
as it used to say. It used to consider their system of 
government as reactionary and linked to Western imperialism, so 
it should be reexamined. 
  The important thing is that, despite all this military 
preparedness by 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the legitimate leadership in 
Yemen has managed to take control of three very large 
governorates -- namely Abyan, Lahij, and Shabwah -- from three 
directions. And Aden is now -- to a large extent -- besieged 
from several directions, especially the al-'Anad base, which is 
actually the third military base in the world in terms of the 
position and preparations inside it. [passage omitted] 
  [Abu-Husayn] If the infighting in Yemen is merely an 
internal rebellion, why did the Security Council discuss it? 
  [Basindwah] Some people say that what is happening in Yemen 
affects the region's security and safety, and we stress that we 
welcome any endeavors as long as they take account of Yemen's 
unity and constitutional legitimacy and refer to the 
Constitution of the Republic of Yemen. This is in addition to 
the return of the forces belonging to the group of apostasy, 
secession, and rebellion to their natural position as an 
integral part of legitimacy under President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. 
  [Abu-Husayn] Is the Security Council abiding by the Yemeni 
demands you have listed? 
  [Basindwah] We are opposed to the Security Council's 
discussing what is happening in Yemen, because what is happening 
in our country is an internal affair. However, we cannot 
prevent the Security Council [from intervening] by virtue of the 
new world situation. 
  [Abu-Husayn] What if the Security Council adopts a 
resolution on a cease-fire only, without prior conditions? 
  [Basindwah] No, no. If that happens, the Security Council 
must stress respect for Yemen's unity and compliance with 
legitimacy. [passage omitted] 
  [Abu-Husayn] When will a cease-fire be announced? 
  [Basindwah] We will respond to a cease-fire the moment the 
secession decision has been revoked and once unionist elements 
in the Socialist party leadership have announced their 
compliance with constitutional legitimacy. 
  [Abu-Husayn] And what if the southern leadership refuses to 
revoke the decision to announce the new [Democratic] Republic of 
Yemen? 
  [Basindwah] The fighting will continue. I would like to 
point out here that we do not want to impose unity by force, 
because the unity was established before the war, that is four 
years ago. It was achieved voluntarily, and a people's 
referendum on it and on the Constitution was held. So it is the 
south which is seeking to impose secession by force. We are 
defending the homeland's unity against this armed rebellion. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Abu-Husayn] [Question not given] 
  [Basindwah] A federation or a confederation might suit 
states whose peoples are divided among themselves ideologically, 
religiously, and linguistically. But in Yemen, we are one 
Muslim people. There are no religious minorities or sects. 
Yemen has been one country throughout history. For example, 
what happened between Egypt and Syria in 1958 does not apply to 
our case in Yemen. [passage omitted] 
  [Abu-Husayn] If 'Ali Salim al-Bid -- and this is an 
assumption -- announces a decision to revoke the republic 
decision, would you hold a dialogue with him? 
  [Basindwah] No, no, no. We would deal with the elements not 
implicated in the secessionist scheme. There are many people on 
whom we are pinning great hopes. 
  [Abu-Husayn] Like whom? 
  [Basindwah] I do not want to specify names so that the 
Socialist Party will not suspect anything. 
  [Abu-Husayn] Is that a maneuver on the northern leadership's 
part to split the Socialist Party, as al-Bid and al-'Attas say? 
  [Basindwah] The Socialist Party has split within itself more 
than once in the past, and we were not responsible for that. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Abu-Husayn] Was the discovery of oil a direct cause of the 
separation, as is being said? 
  [Basindwah] Maybe that is the thinking of al-Bid and 
al-'Attas, the group of rebellion seeking to monopolize the 
Hadhramaut area to establish a state for them in it. But the 
inhabitants of the area will not allow them to do that.

  [Text] In Sanaa, an authoritative source has said that the 
Yemeni Government will hold an extraordinary meeting today in 
the wake of the resolution issued by the United Nations Security 
Council, which calls for a cease-fire in Yemen. The same source 
added that a scheduled news conference today has been postponed 
due to the convening of the emergency meeting of the Council of 
Ministers in which Planning Minister 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani 
will announce Sanaa's stand on the Security Council resolution.

<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Brigadier Yahya </F>
al-Mutawakkil by unidentified correspondent in Sanaa; date not 
given] 
  [Excerpts] [AL-HAYAH] What is the latest in the Yemeni 
crisis? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] It seems clear that the Yemeni crisis is 
fabricated, and we have been dragged into it. It seems that 
there is a plan to drag us -- through the crisis -- into a long 
war of attrition and civil war. The aims are now clear -- to 
fragment and exhaust Yemen through this war, which will destroy 
everything. 
  However, I am optimistic that the Yemenis will realize their 
interests and the danger surrounding them. This is why the 
voice of reason has begun to prevail among the brother unionists 
in the Socialist Party and to respond to the appeal made by 
brother President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih urging the repeal of the 
secession and a return to dialogue. I expect the voice of 
reason to trimph in the end. And the unionist leaders in the 
Socialist Party will revoke the secession decision, which 
amounts to treason. Let us begin a constructive dialogue to 
spare us falling into the dangers into which we are being 
dragged. 
  [AL-HAYAH] But you set four conditions for a dialogue with 
the other side. 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] There are fundamental conditions which 
cannot be abandoned. And there are conditions which can be 
discussed. The fundamental conditions concern unity and 
legitimacy -- two conditions which cannot be abandoned. The 
brothers in the Socialist Party leadership must realize that we 
cannot meet together before these two conditions are agreed. I 
am confident that they are as interested in unity as we are, and 
we must reach an agreement in this connection. 
  [AL-HAYAH] In your capacity as member of the three-men 
committee entrusted with opening a dialogue with the other side, 
what are the results of the contacts being made to open dialogue 
channels? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] Although we have not yet reached a clear 
position regarding contacts between us and unionist leaders in 
the Socialist Party, I am confident that we will reach a 
positive result. The important thing is to initiate a dialogue 
and establish contacts between us now. I am confident that we 
will reach a positive result. [passage omitted] 
  [AL-HAYAH] Do you prefer to reject the Security Council's 
intervention and its resolution on the crisis, or do you prefer 
that amendments be introduced to the proposals submitted to the 
Security Council? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] We would prefer the United Nations and the 
Security Council not to deal with the Yemeni issue, because it 
is an internal issue. Any attempt to deal with it in any way 
means interference in our internal affairs in one way or 
another. As far as we are concerned, we do not want the United 
Nations to deal with our issue. However, if the Security 
Council must deal with this issue, it has to be within the 
premise that unity is fixed and incontestable. [passage omitted] 
  [AL-HAYAH] Some Arab states talk about the presence of 
Afghan Arab mujahidin [Arabs who fought alongside Afghan 
Mojahedin against Soviets], saying their task is to bolster 
extremist fundamentalist movements, especially in Algeria and 
Egypt. What is your opinion? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] I categorically deny the presence of any 
Arab mujahidin in Yemen. With regard to Islamists, we are all 
Muslims. As for the presence of Yemeni Islamic political leaders 
in Yemen, this is legal for them and others. But there are no 
Arab and Islamic political parties on the scene. Nor is there 
any consolidation of an Islamic or political tendency as rumored 
by Yemen's enemies.

  [Text] Sanaa, 1 Jun (INA) -- An official Yemeni source has 
told INA correspondent in Sanaa that the legitimate Yemeni 
forces have seized 80 tanks which were sent from Saudi Arabia to 
the secessionists in Aden. 
  The source said that Saudi Arabia moved these tanks via the 
al-'Abr border area into Hadhramaut Governotate three days ago. 
  The source added that Yemeni tribes in Shabwah Governorate 
and Hadhramaut Governorate seized the tanks when those who were 
transporting them hinted that they were representatives of 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid. 
  The source explained that as a result, Yemeni President 
Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih contacted Saudi King 
Fahd by telephone and informed him that he had received the 
consignment of tanks sent to the secessionists.

<F P=106> ["Text" of letter to the chairmen of the UN Security Council </F>
and the UN General Assembly from the DRY Presidential Council, 
the chairmanship of the interim Assembly for National Salvation, 
and the DRY Council of Ministers; place and date not given] 
  [Text] We wish to convey to you and through you to all the 
member states of the UN Security Council and of the UN General 
Assembly our best greetings and to place before you this appeal 
on behalf of the Presidential Council, the interim Assembly for 
National Salvation, and the chairmanship of the Council of 
Ministers in the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY] in order to 
present to you the circumstances of the oppressive military 
aggression to which our people have been subjected by the ruling 
regime in Sanaa for over a month. This is to enable you to 
direct your attention and concern to bear on the matter and 
encourage you to adopt an immediate resolution providing for an 
end to the destructive war in both Sanaa and Aden, without any 
preconditions, and to invite the relevant Yemeni sides to engage 
in unconditional negotiations with a view to arriving at 
peaceful solutions to any differences between the two sides, 
under the auspices of the Arab league and the UN organization. 
In this context, we wish to place before you the following 
facts: 
  1. The ruling regime in Sanaa has in practical terms 
violated all legitimacy and constitutionality simply by having 
declared war against the Yemeni people, particularly against the 
southern and eastern governorates which currently constitute the 
DRY. 
  2. The declaration of war and its prosecution, and the 
rejection of national, Arab, and international appeals to stop 
the fighting, are scandalous violations of the fundamental bases 
of security and stability and expose the higher interests of the 
people and the homeland to great danger and damage. 
  3. Persisting with the war damages not only democratic 
Yemen, but also constitutes a danger to the whole region by 
threatening international peace and security. 
  4. The crimes which the Sanaa regime has committed through 
mounting operations of arrests, assassinations, torture and 
kidnapping of the opposition, and the political and patriotic 
[word indistinct] which rejected the method of war, are clear 
violations of human rights and the International Charter on 
Human Rights and of the two international charters [as heard] 
and of all the other international agreements which Yemen has 
signed. 
  5. The barefaced savage military aggression on the part of 
the Sanaa regime has basically targeted civilian areas and the 
civilian inhabitants in the border areas between the two 
countries. Hospitals, schools, resideces, electric power 
stations, and water reservoirs have been shelled in many of the 
DRY's cities and villages. 
  6. The declaration of war against the DRY means that the aim 
of the Sanaa regime is not unity, as it falsely states, but the 
entrenchment of more power and domination to gratify its 
ambitions and selfish interests which are basically 
irreconcilable with the higher interests of the people and 
homeland. The regime unleashed its aggression to eradicate 
these areas; to put an end to unity and to (?justify) the 
excuses it has served up. This made the establishment of the 
DRY unavoidable in order to salvage what could be salvaged for 
the homeland and the people. 
  7. Accordingly, the declaration of the establishment of the 
DRY was the logical result of this aggressive and destructive 
war. What the Sanaa regime is doing is perpetuating its 
aggression on another state. It is not an internal matter, as 
the rulers of Sanaa claim. Thus, the reestablishment of the DRY, 
with its complete leadership which it has had since 30 November 
1967, is a natural, legal act. 
  8. The Sanaa regime has recently escalated the fierceness of 
the fighting. It did so, after the matter was handed over to 
the UN Security Council by the Arab states, in a desperate 
attempt to establish a fait accompli and complete its occupation 
of a relatively large part of the territory of the DRY. In the 
face of this disastrous scenario, we appeal to you to take the 
initiative by immediately and instantly resolving the following: 
  1. An immediate and unconditional end to the war. 
  2. The withdrawal of the invasion forces of the Sanaa regime 
from the territory of the DRY to their own territory. 
  3. Dispatch of international forces to separate the forces 
of the two sides on the border between the two countries, or at 
least the dispatch of international observer forces to supervise 
observance of the cease-fire and to stop the fighting. 
  4. Issuance of an invitation to negotiate under the auspices 
of the United Nations and the Arab League. 
  5. Rejection of the principle to impose unity by force, 
which is in violation of international norms and of the new 
world order. 
  6. Application of Section 7 of the UN Charter to authorize 
the use of force if the Sanaa regime refrains from adhering to 
these resolutions. 
  7. Genocide and the destruction of the social, military and 
economic foundations of any country is an act that ineluctably 
attracts the intervention of the international community to 
protect the basic rights of any people. These rights include 
life, security, stability and to choose its political, social 
and international system -- to secure for the people all the 
guarantees declared in the international human rights 
declaration. Article 30 of the International Declaration on 
Human Rights states that it does not contain any provision which 
can be interpreted as permitting a state to take any action, 
activity or [word indistinct] aimed at destroying the rights and 
freedoms laid down in the declaration. 
  We are confident that you will respond to this appeal and 
issue your just resolution as quickly as possible with a view to 
preserving the fundamental considerations of security and 
international peace and so as to prevent the sparks of the 
destructive war from being transferred to the neighboring 
states. As for the fabrication that what is happening is an 
internal matter as claimed by the Sanaa regime, in spite of the 
fact that it is aggression against another side in the union, 
this has now become aggression against a state whose 
establishment has been declared. In this respect, Article 2, 
Chapter 7 of the UN Charter lays down at its end and that 
interference in [internal] affairs is the province of the 
internal authorities of a state but this must not detract from 
the application of curbs as laid down in Chapter 7 of the 
charter. This means that there can be intervention under 
exceptional circumstances in these affairs if international 
security and peace is threatened. 
  This is what is happening now in the broadening of the scope 
of the military battles, which are likely to expose 
international peace and security to danger. Moreover, waging 
war and declaring battle by internal authorities in any state 
cannot be regarded as an internal matter by any yardstick, 
because it is not an internal matter. Military aggression is 
now being directed against all the governorates which formerly 
comprised a UN member state and the second partner in the 
unified state, which [the unified state] alone has the right to 
wage war, as opposed to the remaining governorates which used to 
form the Yemeni Arab Republic having that right. So this is far 
from being an internal matter. On the contrary, it is naked 
aggression by one side against another. Moreover, the aims of 
this aggression and its results violate the aims of the UN 
organization and its principles, as set out in the first chapter 
of the charter. 
  Furthermore, any state which is not a member of the United 
Nations has the right to approach the Security Council in 
respect of any conflict to which it is party provided it accepts 
in advance a peaceful solution as provided for in the UN 
Charter. This is provided for under Chapter 35, Article 2 of 
the charter. Accordingly, the rejection by the other side of the 
peaceful solution also gives the Security Council the right to 
apply Chapter 7 of the charter without any hesitation. 
  In conclusion, we hope that we have clarified our position, 
which aims at preserving security and peace, the safety of the 
lives of the civilians, and ending the destruction, and we await 
from you a positive stance in this respect. We also hope that 
this appeal of ours will be classified as a document among the 
documents of the United Nations and that it will be distributed 
to the member states. Accept our compliments: 
  [Signed] DRY Presidential Council, chairmanship of the 
interim Assembly for National Salvation, and the chairmanship of 
the DRY Council of Ministers

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Differences Inside Socialist Party </F>
Leadership Over Decision To Announce Secession"] 
  [Text] Aden, AL-HAYAH -- An authoritative Yemeni Socialist 
Party [YSP] source revealed yesterday that the "announcement of 
the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Yemen and the 
separation from the united state announced on 22 May 1990 has 
provoked a dispute inside the YSP leadership. A wing led by the 
party's northerners like Jarallah 'Umar and Yahya al-Shami has 
voiced reservations about this step. This is in addition to Dr. 
Yasin Sa'id Nu'man, chairman of the YSP secretariat." 
  The source said: "Northerners view the announcement of the 
establishment of a separate republic in the south as a serious 
matter which should be referred to the party's leading and 
grassroots committees -- which has not been done, as 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid took the secession decision single-handedly during his 
presence in Hadhramaut, his birthplace." The source pointed out 
that the "YSP, which has always stressed that it is a unionist 
party, cannot become secessionist now." 
  Dr. Yasin Nu'man refused to speak to any media services, 
insisting on secluding himself at his home in Aden in protest at 
al-Bid's step. A number of YSP leaders have asked al-Bid to 
hold an extraordinary Central Committee meeting to address this 
serious situation. 
  AL-HAYAH has learned from leading YSP sources opposed to 
al-Bid's opinion that "the YSP leader is refusing to hold such a 
meeting." 
  Rashid Muhammad Thabit, member of the YSP Central Committee 
and one of the members opposed to al-Bid's announcement, has 
said that "al-Bid violated the party's unity and acted 
single-handedly with some oppositionist forces which are now 
divided among themselves."

<F P=106> [Report by Rafiq al-Ma'luf, Sulayman Nimr, Iqbal 'Abdallah, </F>
and Hamad al-Jasir: "Al-'Attas Emphasizes to AL-HAYAH: 
Socialist Party Unity Stronger Than Ever Before"] 
  [Excerpt] Washington, Sanaa, Aden, Kuwait -- [passage 
omitted] In a statement to AL-HAYAH after his arrival in 
Bahrain from Kuwait yesterday, [South Yemen Prime Minister] 
Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas ridiculed reports of a split in the 
Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]. He told AL-HAYAH: "The 
allegation that there are disagreements inside the YSP 
leadership is a cracked record, because since the unity was 
established Sanaa has worked to split the YSP. It exerted every 
effort, allocated huge sums of money, and conspired against many 
people, but it failed to achieved its aim of splitting the YSP, 
which is now more united than ever before. The Political Bureau 
replied to Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani's statement on a split 
two days ago. All this confirms that Sanaa is desperately 
trying to play this card, but to no avail. Sanaa's behavior 
reflects the secessionist spirit it has exercised with all 
national leaderships in all parties on the national scene. It 
is pursuing its known policy based on the divide-and-rule 
principle. It has worked to cause splits among tribes and 
numerous national parties, and the Yemeni scene bears witness to 
that." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri, "leader of the Sons </F>
of Yemen League and vice president of the Democratic Republic of 
Yemen," by Lutfi Shatarah in London; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Shatarah] Some observers believe that the 
declaration of the secession of the south was perhaps meant to 
pressure Sanaa into a cease-fire and into accepting a federation 
or confederation. 
  [Al-Jifri] The secession was declared not by us but by 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih. What we did was announce the result which 
Salih caused, because we had agreed with him before the war that 
a declaration of secession would mean a declaration of war by 
either side and that a declaration of war would mean secession. 
So he declared war knowing that that would mean secession. 
  Secondly, they (the northerners) say that they have occupied 
one area or another which means that they are advocates not of 
unity but of occupation, and that their view of unity is that 
they should occupy and control others. 
  Thirdly, we are not playing games to set up a state as a 
means of pressure for a cease-fire but we cannot accept unity on 
the old foundations and we cannot place the lives and future of 
the public in the hands of people obsessed with domination and 
hegemony. 
  We, however, advocate unity based on law and order, 
equality, 
democracy, and respect for human rights. When there is a regime 
in Sanaa which believes in what we believe in, then we will 
discuss unity with it. Also, if 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih observes a 
cease-fire and withdraws his forces then we would be willing to 
build special and cordial relations with our brothers in the 
north and later develop these relations into anything. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Shatarah] It has been rumored that there is U.S. pressure 
on you to revoke the secession decision in return for which 
Sanaa would be forced to stop the war and agree on a new form of 
unity. What, in your view, would that form be, after missiles 
have hit Sanaa as well as Aden? 
  [Al-Jifri] There is no U.S. pressure on us in that 
direction. We know that our American friends are indeed against 
infighting in our country and against the imposition of unity by 
force, and that they are in favor of unity on new and sound 
foundations. We never called for anything else before. We 
believe that a cease-fire and withdrawal of forces to their 
pre-22 May 1990 positions would pave the way for calm and 
sensible negotiations that would maintain some kind of link 
between the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY] and the Yemeni 
Arab Republic [YAR]. That way we would achieve the stability 
sought by everyone at home and abroad. [passage omitted] 
  [Shatarah] There are conflicting reports about the results 
of the battles, sometimes exaggerated. What is the true 
military situation on the various fronts? 
  [Al-Jifri] In such battles on such a long front there is 
bound to be advance and retreat and confused and exaggerated 
reports, but what we want to fully emphasize is that Aden is 
protected, firstly by God and then by our people in the 
battlefields led by Defense Minister Brigadier General Haytham 
Qasim Tahir, his aides, the chief of staff, the air eagles, and 
the naval forces. 
  'Ali 'Abdallah Salih will not be able to conquer Aden. That 
we categorically affirm. His plan was to occupy Aden within 48 
hours or five days at the most. We are now in the fourth week. 
Even in four months his position would be worse and ours would 
be better. We are defending a cause and our territory and he is 
an aggressor without a cause. [passage omitted] 
  [Shatarah] Has there been any confirmation of Iraqi or 
Sudanese involvement in the current war in Yemen? 
  [Al-Jifri] We have definite indications or information about 
involvement of quarters from outside the DRY and YAR in this 
sedition triggered by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. At present at 
al-Hudaydah air base there are experts, training instructors, 
and pilots from abroad. As regards those who claim to be 
fighting in the name of Islamic Jihad, God knows that we know 
Islam better than them and are more committed to it than them, 
otherwise they would not have destroyed entire villages, 
including women and children, in the holy months and during 'Id 
al-Adha. [passage omitted] 
  [Shatarah] It has been claimed that al-Bid has moved his 
headquarters to Hadhramaut and that he is running his affairs 
from there. What are the justifications for such a move in the 
circumstances? 
  [Al-Jifri] President 'Ali Salim al-Bid went to Hadhramaut to 
to carry out extremely important tasks and to deal with various 
matters at local, Arab, or international levels. Wherever there 
are duties for the brother president or any of the officials in 
the south to perform, they would go to perform these duties. 
  [Shatarah] Could it be that he moved there because Aden 
became unsafe? 
  [Al-Jifri] That is not true at all. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Brothers 'Abd-al-Qawi Makkawi, member of the 
Presidential Council, and Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, the prime 
minister, returned back home to Aden yesterday following a tour 
they made to a number of Arab countries which included the Arab 
Republic of Egypt, Syria Arab Republic, the Saudi Arabian 
Kingdom, the Qatar, whereby they carried letters from brother 
'Ali Salim al-Bid, the chairman of the Presidential Council, to 
the leaders of these countries, related to the developments of 
the situation in the Yemeni arena. They were received at Aden 
Airport by brothers 'Abd-al-Rahman 'Ali al-Jifri, the vice 
chairman of the Presidential Council, Sulayman Nasir Mas'ud, 
member of the Presidential Council, Anis Hasan Yahya, the 
chairman of the National Assembly for Salvation, Dr. Yasin Said 
Nu'man, polital bureau member and chairman of the board of the 
secretariat of the Central Committee of the Yemeni Socialist 
Party, and other officials. 
  Brothers 'Abd-al-Qawi Makkawi and Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas 
described their tour and their consultations with the leaders of 
these countries as extremely positive and they found an 
understanding to the whole situation prevailing in Yemen. In 
their statement to the press and the mass media following their 
return home, they praised the good endeavors and efforts which 
are being made by these countries for stopping the destructive 
war in Yemen. 
  They expressed confidence that these endeavors will lead to 
reason aiming to stop the war and return to the language of 
sense and dialogue for resolving differences and problems. 
  Earlier yesterday afternoon, brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid the 
chairman of the Presidential Council in al-Mukalla, received 
brothers 'Abd-al-Qawi Makkawi, member of the Presidential 
Council and Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, the prime minister, 
during their stop-over in Mukalla where the brother president 
expressed his welcome to the return of the prominent patriotic 
personality 'Abd- al-Qawi Makkawi to the homeland after long 
years of repatriation, confirming his confidence that Makkawi 
who is returning now as a member of the Presidential Council, 
will play a big role in building the state of democratic Yemen. 
  Brother the chairman of the Presidential Council also 
congratulated brother al-'Attas for his safe and sound return 
after his trip for medical treatment abroad. 
  After that brothers Makkawi and al-Attas presented a 
detailed 
account to the brother president about the results of the tour 
they made in a number of the fraternal Arab countries and their 
meeting with the leaders of these countries expressing their 
satisfaction about the results of these visits and the response 
and eagerness of the fraternals in the Arab countries with our 
country's orientations which calls for stopping the fighting and 
preventing Yemeni bloodshed.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Questions About Fate of Shaykh Sinan </F>
Abu-Luhum"] 
  [Text] London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Various reports have 
been circulating in Yemeni political circles and in diplomatic 
circles about the fate of Shaykh Sinan Abu-Luhum, leader of the 
Popular Forces Union and a senior chieftain of the Bakil tribes 
who is known for his opposition to President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih and his sympathy with the positions and policy of the 
Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] throughout the years of Yemeni 
unity. 
  Informed sources note that Shaykh Abu-Luhum has disappeared 
from the arena in recent weeks, since his return to Sanaa at the 
beginning of the Yemeni war. Despite his state of health and 
advanced age, he had made great efforts in bridging the views of 
Yemeni president and his Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid since 
the beginning of the crisis last August. 
  The sources say that Abu-Luhum may be under house arrest at 
present for refusing to add his name to the list of supporters 
signed by a number of YSP and opposition leaders currently in 
Sanaa despite their known opposition to President Salih in the 
past. 
  It is worth noting that commercial offices partly owned by 
Shaykh Sinan were burned down six week ago while he was in the 
United States for medical treatment, because of the positions he 
had taken and statements he made to Sanaa's dissatisfaction, 
particularly his support for a strong Arab role in settling the 
Yemeni crisis after the Sanaa and Aden officials failed to 
contain that crisis.

<F P=106> [By Umer Farooq] </F>
  [Text] Islamabad -- The leader of the opposition, Mian 
Nawaz Sharif, has alleged that President Farooq Leghari received 
Rs. [rupees] 15 million from Mehran Bank for horse-trading both 
on the eve of general elections and the presidential election. 
  Nawaz Sharif levied the allegation at a press conference on 
Tuesday. He also produced the credit vouchers and the bank 
account numbers and the names of trading companies through which 
the payment was made to Farooq Leghari. At the press conference 
the bank pay order numbers and the photostat copies of Mehran 
Bank pay orders were also presented to the pressmen. "These are 
the unimpeachable evidence relating to Rs 15 millions taken out 
by President Farooq Leghari for horse-trading both on the eve of 
the general elections and the election of president of 
Pakistan", said Nawaz Sharif. 
  Earlier, the speaker, National Assembly, expunged the 
aspersions cast by the leader of the opposition on President 
Farooq Leghari on the floor of the House. The speaker told the 
leader of the opposition that under Article 248(b) of the Rules 
of Business of the National Assembly to aspersions on the person 
of the president could be made on the floor of National 
Assembly. [sentence as published] 
  However, the speaker received the documents of evidence 
produced by Nawaz Sharif in the House. Later, when in defiance 
of the ruling of the speaker Nawaz Sharif refused to sit down, 
the speaker suspended the proceedings of the assembly. 
  The leader of the opposition later addressed a press 
conference in the Parliament cafeteria and alleged that 
President Farooq Leghari had used his political clout for 
gaining financial benefits. "The conduct of President Farooq 
Leghari be a cause of insult to the whole nation", he said. 
  He alleged that a few days before the presidential elections 
Farooq Leghari obtained Rs. 7600,000 from Sharae Fetima Jinnah 
branch of Mehran Bank Ltd, situated in Lahore. Six pay orders, 
numbering 003994 to 003999 for Rs. 1,250,000 each and totalling 
Rs 7,500,000 were obtained from Mehran Bank Ltd, Sharae Fatima 
Jinnah, Nawaz Sharif said. 
  He said that all the six trading companies through which 
Farooq Leghari had received money are fake and were operated by 
the notorious Yunus Habib. He said that according to latest 
reports of FIA [Federal Investigative Agency] all the six 
accounts that were debited to issue the said pay orders are fake 
benami [account in someone else's name] accounts maintained by 
Yunus Habib to rob the Mehran Bank. Nawaz Sharif also produced 
a list of fake companies prepared by FIA, which includes the 
names of trading companies through which Farooq Leghari received 
the money. The names include Moosani Tradino (Account number 
8890-1), Rasco Enterprises (A/C No. 9954-1) International 
Traders (A/C No. 15237-1), Munir Corporation A/C No. 17787-1), 
Aziz International (A/C No. 177950-1) and Salim Corporation (A/C 
No. 17817-1). 
  All the six pay orders carry the following endorsement on 
their back in the handwriting of Sarder Farooq Leghari -- 
"Please deposit in my Current Account No. 12025-1", Nawaz Sharif 
said and added that the pay orders are signed by Sardar Farooq 
Leghari himself. He said that these pay orders were credited in 
A/C No. 1202501 of Sardar Farooq Leghari at Muslim Commercial 
Bank, Lahore on Sept. 25, 93 through branch transfer voucher. 
  Nawaz Sharif told the press conference that on Nov. 6, 1993, 
Rs 7,500,000 were again obtained by Sardar Farooq Leghari for 
use in the presidential election. A set of six dubious 
transactions was reenacted. Debit advices of Rs 125,000 each 
were raised on the Mehran head office in Karachi and a total 
credit of Rs. 7,500,000 given in the account of Sardar Farooq 
Leghari. This amount was gradually withdrawn, he added. 
  Nawaz Sharif termed the way Mehran Bank was [word 
indistinct] 
by Farooq Leghari the "most shameful" as that had no precedent 
in the history of Pakistan. "The people who cover up their 
crimes are not more clever than the people who expose it", he 
said. 
  He said the speaker had set a very bad precedent by not 
allowing the leader of the opposition to speak on the floor of 
the House. "If similarly the leader of the house is also not 
allowed to speak in National Assembly, than what will be the 
utility of the Assembly", he said. 
  Returning to the president, he said that after the 
disclosure 
of such financial corruption on the part of the president, he 
should waste no time in resigning from his post. "We demand his 
resignation", he said. In response to a query, he said that 
opposition would decide whether to move an impeachment motion 
against the president. 
  Levelling another allegation against the president, he said 
that it was now a matter of record that Farooq Leghari when he 
was an opposition member of parliament, was constantly 
conspiring with a serving general Lt-Gen Asad Durrani to 
overthrow the legal and democratically elected government of 
PML(N) [Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz)]. Because of this 
conspiracy, Lt. Gen. Asad Durrani was removed from service and 
retired, since this act was tantamount to undermining the army's 
discipline. "However, I wonder while one character of the plot 
was removed from service, the other character of the plot, 
Farooq Leghari was made the supreme commander of the armed 
forces," he said. 
  Enumerating other allegations against the president, he 
listed the following points: 1 -- Lavish [word indistinct] 
parties costing Rs. 6 millions. 2 -- He bought land worth Rs 
1.6 milion at [word indistinct] Dilana and when the site was 
declared to be the location of an airport, he promptly sold it 
to the Civil Aviation Authority for 25 millions. 3 -- He has 
transformed the President's House into a personal recreational 
place with the building of a riding track, a stable, a golf 
course, a shooting range etc. Rs 25 million has already been 
spent on the refurbishing of the president's house. 
  Nawaz Sharif also said that the way he has humiliated 
Pakistan by trying to convert a purely private visit to USA into 
an official one by using public money shows that he has 
absolutely no regard for the prestige of Pakistan and the 
protocol of the office of president. 
  He also alleged that the president had acted 
unconstitutionally in dislodging the government of Pir Sabir 
Shah in NWFP [North-West Frontier Province]. His act has 
weakened the federation.

  [Text] An official spokesman has described the allegations 
against the president of Pakistan in a so-called fact sheet 
issued by Nawaz Muslim League as a forgery and a crude and 
disgraceful attempt to malign the head of state. The spokesman 
said the people of Pakistan were shocked by the wanton and 
irresponsible behavior of this defeated and discredited group of 
politicians to malign the head of state when he is abroad and is 
meeting world leaders. The spokesman said the callous attitude 
toward national interest is characteristic of this section of 
the opposition.

<F P=106> [Report by Aroosa Alam; all quotation marks as published] </F>
  [Text] Islamabad, May 30 -- The ISI [Inter-Services 
Intelligence] ISPR [Interservice Public Relations] and Foreign 
Office have strongly contradicted the story run by WASHINGTON 
POST [WP] and THE GUARDIAN about arming of the Kashmiri 
guerrillas by Pakistan Army saying that WP's correspondent John 
Ward Anderson did not meet either any official of ISI or top 
functionaries of the Foreign Office to discuss any aspect of the 
story in question. 
  Talking to THE MUSLIM here on Monday [word indistinct] 
officials of the three organisations expressed their serious 
reservations about the contents of the malicious story and above 
all about the timing of the publication of the story. The story 
has been published around the time the Indian Prime Minister was 
in the US and two days before the private visit of the Pakistani 
President. 
  Knowledgeable sources said it was pertinent to note that 
WASHINGTON POST's correspondent visited Pakistan in the last 
week of March and met only an official of the level of Director 
General in Islamabad. The Foreign Minister and the Foreign 
Secretary had declined to meet him because of their 
preoccupations with important matters. 
  Intriguingly, the WASHINGTON POST correspondent chose to 
file 
his story a month and half after his visit. That he had to wait 
for such a long time to file his story is indicative of mala 
fide [as published] intentions. 
  According to the report reproduced by THE GUARDIAN in its 
issue dated May 17, 1994, Pakistan military sources admit they 
have resumed arming, training and providing logistical support 
to militants fighting Indian security forces in Kashmir less 
than a year after convincing the US they had adopted a hands off 
policy there. 
  The report goes on to say: "The Pakistan Army's 
Inter-Services Intelligence directorate -- akin to the CIA -- 
and its field intelligence unit are coordinating the shipment of 
arms from Pakistani Kashmir to the Indian side where Muslim 
insurgents are waging a protracted war, the sources said. They 
said the Pakistani military was also occasionally helping to 
train militants and coordinate their fight against India. India 
and Pakistan each control a portion of Kashmir, but each claim 
the entire region. Pakistani officials denied any active role in 
arming or training militants. 
  The US considers Kashmir a potential flashpoint for a 
nuclear 
war. India and Pakistan -- both capable of making nuclear bombs 
-- have fought three wars since independence 47 years ago -- two 
of them being over Kashmir. "The Pakistani military sources -- 
including two serving and two recently retired army officials 
involved in the ISI's Kashmir operations -- said Pakistan had 
suspended active support for the insurgency last year when the 
US threatened to include it to the list of countries sponsoring 
terrorism. This would automatically have served aid and 
business ties between the two countries. 
  Pakistan then `privatised' its Kashmir operations, funneling 
support to militants through non-governmental organisations 
often run by retired army and ISI officials, the sources said. 
They said that when the US failed to include Pakistan to the 
terrorist list, the army resumed its active operations early 
this year, although at a reduced level. 
  "In its annual report on terrorism released this month, the 
US State Department confirmed `there were credible reports in 
1993 of official Pakistani support to Kashmir militants'. `Many 
private organisations also continue to arm the insurgents with 
the Pakistani help', the sources said. 
  Giving his comments on the WASHINGTON POST/THE GUARDIAN 
report, a spokesman of the Foreign Office said that though the 
correspondent who has filed this report, usually carries 
objective reports, unfortunately and surprisingly the report in 
question is totally baseless and fabricated. The correspondent 
he said, has failed to substantiate his report with 
circumstantial evidence. 
  Except for quoting some unidentified sources, the 
correspondent has not mentioned any spot or the name of the 
camps where the Kashmiri guerrillas are being allegedly trained 
and armed, the Foreign Office spokesman said. 
  The ISI sources while talking to THE MUSLIM said that the 
story is fabricated to the extent that we don't even wish to 
comment on it. They, however, made it categorically clear that 
none of the foreign correspondents or privately with any of the 
officers in the ISI in particular and with army officers in 
general. 
  When the top aides of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto were 
asked if there was any change in Bhutto government's policy with 
regard to hands-off to Kashmiri guerrillas, they said Ms. Bhutto 
has time and again made public statements that Pakistan was only 
supporting the Kashmiri guerrillas diplomatically and 
politically. They said it is unfortunate to misinterpret the 
policy statements of the government. A government acts on the 
same policy which it professes publicly. 
  They said it's a well calculated move to malign a 
prestigious, sensitive agency which has effectively checked the 
infiltration and activities of RAW [Research and Analysis Wing] 
and Mosad agents in Pakistan, particularly in Sindh. The 
government sources confirmed that this security agency has 
nabbed a large number of RAW agents from Azad Kashmir and Sindh. 
They said the lists of these agents would be handed over to the 
Indian government when and if required.

<F P=106> [By Nadeem Hussain] </F>
  [Text] Islamabad, May 31 -- The National Economic Council 
(NEC) which met here Tuesday with Prime Minister in chair 
approved the 8th five year plan of Rs [rupees] 1701 billion. 
  The 8th five year plan registers an increase of 48 per cent 
over the 7th five year plan which was Rs 1149 billion. The size 
of the plan has been fixed on the constant price to make the 
comparison with the 7th five year plan easy. 
  The major emphasis in the 8th five year plan is on 
education, 
health and energy sectors. The share of public and private 
sector in the plan has also been increased compared to the 
previous plan. 
  The major character of the 8th plan is to ensure a minimum 
investment of Rs 949 billion against Rs 596 billion in the 7th 
five year plan. 
  The share of the public rector in the 8th plan has been 
increased to Rs 751 billion compared to Rs 553 billion in the 
7th plan, showing an increase of 59 per cent. The budget 
announcing over the five years in the public sector would be of 
Rs 483 billion. 
  The share of private sector has been envisaged as Rs 949 
billion compared to Rs 596 billion in the 7th plan reflecting an 
increase of 48 per cent. 
  The Deputy Chairman, Planning, Saeed Ahmad Qureshi and 
Minister for Information, Khalid Ahmad Kharal, gave the briefing 
regarding the 8th five year plan. 
  The size of the public sector programme has also been 
increased in the 8th plan [word indistinct] it is nominal. 
  It has been kept at Rs 752 billion out of which Rs 483 
billion would be budget financed whereas Rs 269 billion would be 
corporate and market financed. 
  In the 7th five-year plan, the size of the Public Sector 
Programme was of Rs 553 billion out of which Rs 457 billion were 
budget financed and Rs 96 billion were corporate and market 
financed. This means that in the 8th five-year plan, the share 
of corporate and market financed has been increased three-fold 
which to many seems overoptimistic. 
  The growth targets have also been fixed in the 8th five-year 
plan. These targets for all practical purposes are unrealistic. 
  A comprehensive macro economic management policy has been 
adopted in the 8th five-year plan, according to which the growth 
targets would be achieved in a frame work of equity, stability 
and sustainability. 
  The overall fiscal deficit would be reduced from 7.9 per 
cent 
to 4 per cent of GDP and the current account deficit would be 
brought down from 3.7 billion dollars at present to 1.84 billion 
dollars by the end of 8th five-year plan, which means the level 
would be brought down from 7 per cent a present to 24 per cent 
of GDP. 
  The plan is also aimed at containing the long-term external 
debt at 36 per cent of GDP and keep monetary expansion below the 
growth of nominal GDP and also to reduce inflation rate from 9.3 
per cent to 6 per cent. The plan also envisages to raise 
national savings from 15.8 per cent to 19.9 per cent and 
generate 6.2 million new jobs against 3.2 million in the 7th 
plan. 
  The 8th five-year plan has been targeted to make the GDP 
growth rate to increase by 7 per cent, agriculture sector 4.9 
per cent, industry 9.4 per cent, manufacturing 9.9 per cent and 
services sector 6.7 per cent. 
  The annual plan for the forthcoming fiscal year 1994-95 was 
also approved. 
  The targets for the forthcoming fiscal year 1994-95 have 
been 
envisaged as GDP growth 6.9 per cent, agriculture 8 per cent, 
manufacturing 6.9 per cent, exports 19 per cent, imports 10.7 
per cent and inflation to be reduced to 7.5 per cent. 
  The size of the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) 
for the forthcoming fiscal year was also approved. The original 
size of the PSDP was Rs 94 billion but NEC approved the size of 
the PSDP for Rs 90 billion. 
  Provinces would be given Rs 25 billion. The important 
budgetary programme was approved which include Social Action 
Plan (SAP) community health, water and drainage, [word 
indistinct] Nuclear and [word indistinct]. 
  To meet the new challenges of competitive market, the 8th 
five-year plan provides three-pronged strategy. This includes: 
(1) lowering tax rates and broadening tax base; ensuring 
documentation of the economy, (2) establishment of special 
concessions and rent-seeking activities and (3) lowering tariff 
structure and integration with the world economy. 
  On the education side, a major breakthrough would be 
achieved 
by increasing the literacy rate from 34 per cent to 48 per cent. 
Output of technicians in the country world be increased by 50 
per cent from 85,000 to 127,000. 
  The participation in primary education for boys would be 
increased from 85 per cent to 96 per cent and for girls from 54 
per cent to 82 per cent, which according to the plan makers 
would be quite a landmark. 
  In the health sector, 33,000 village health workers would be 
engaged, which would be the first major effort of its kind be 
rural areas, other salient features in this sector include the 
full immunization of mother and child, enhanced coverage of 
preventive services from 80 per cent to 90 per cent, life 
expectancy to go up from 61.5 years to 66.5 years and infant 
mortality rate to decline from 8.6 per cent to 6.5 per cent by 
the end of 8th plan. 
  Regarding population control, the population planning 
programme coverage would be increased from 20 per cent to 80 
percent, i.e. in the urban areas from 54 percent to 100 percent 
and in rural areas from 5 percent to 70 percent. The rural 
water supply coverage would increase from 17 percent to 71 
percent of the population. Rural [word indistinct] coverage to 
go up from 14 percent to 32 percent. 
  In the energy sector, construction of Ghazi-Barotha dam of 
1,450 MW would be the main priority. Whereas thermal generation 
of more than 2,500 MW in private sector has also been envisaged. 
  Other salient features of the energy plan include completion 
of ongoing Hub Power Project in private sector, privatisation of 
thermal plants of WAPDA [Water and Power Development Authority], 
increase in power generation capacity by 56 percent (16,285 MW), 
increase in oil production by 75 percent (19,113 barrels per 
day), increase in gas production by 59 percent ([figure 
indistinct] MMCBD), increase in refining capacity by 3 times (20 
million tens per annum), and electrification of 19,700 villages. 
  A comprehensive transport and communication plan has been 
prescribed in the plan which includes double rail track from 
[word indistinct] to Peshawar, manufacturing of 1,367 large 
capacity wagons, completion of Indus Highway, completion of 
dualisation of national highway and completion of 
Lahore-Islamabad Motorway, construction of Gawadar port through 
private sector, clearing pending demands for telephone 
connections and laying 2.5 million new lines and increase in the 
number of post offices from 13,513 to 18,513. 
  The 8th five-year plan lays emphasis on agriculture sector. 
The plan maintains integrated management of agriculture, 
irrigation and drainage, integrated pest mangament, introduction 
of sprinkle and trickle irrigation, better soil management, more 
emphasis or non-crop sector and establishment of Kisan Bank.

  [Text] Kaiga, May 29 (PTI) -- Experts investigating the 
dome failure of the atomic plant here have described as 
"primature and highly regretable" [quote as published] last 
week's announcement by the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) 
that the incident was caused by alteration of construction 
procedure of site without approval. 
  "As of now, we have not unearthed evidence of any lapse in 
construction practice at site and we are surprised how AERB came 
to this conclusion," chairman of the six-member expert 
committee, Mr. C. H. Surendar, told a visiting reporter. 
  He said that all documents obtained by the committee showed 
that each stage of construction of the dome had "the approval of 
the STUPP consultants who supplied the design" and that the 
contractor, Larsen and Toubro [L and T], had meticulously 
followed the procedures. 
  Some committee members said the hasty pronouncement by the 
AERB and subsequent "uninformed doomsday editorials" in 
newspapers caused a setback to the investigation that will take 
at least two months to pin-point the cause of the dome collapse 
and suggest remedial measures. 
  Nuclear Power Corporation Managing Director S. K. Chatterjee 
said over the phone that AERB's "conjecture" at this stage was 
"least expected" and assured that the Kaiga project will not 
suffer any delay and that the incident "is no cause for concern 
about safety." 
  Chief executive of STUPP Consultants are already in France 
for discussions with the parent company and Mr S.M. Pradhan, an 
engineer of the L and T described AERB's verdict as "outrageous". 
  DESIGN FAILURE: Without wanting to be drawn into a 
controversy, Kaiga project director Mr. Paramahamsa Tewari said 
he totally "ruled out any deficiency in construction procedures, 
quality control and on-site supervision." He said the cause of 
dome failure lay elsewhere, probably in the design which the 
AERB had approved. 
  Mr. Tewari said if materials used were sub-standard, the 
entire dome would have collapsed, which was not the case. 
  During the past two days, the committee examined all the 
records pertaining to construction methods and quality control 
practices and also identified the places from where to take 
samples of concrete for analysis. 
  "We are looking at everything, including possible defect in 
the design of the pre-stressed dome," Mr. Surendar said before 
his departure. The calculations of the STUPP Consultants will 
be rechecked and the behaviour of the dome -- until it failed -- 
will be simulated in a computer to find out what exactly went 
wrong. 
  To a question whether there could be a release of 
radioactivity if the dome had failed after the Kaiga plant had 
been commissioned, Mr. Surendar said there should be no such 
fear since "a fully pre-stressed dome cannot collapse". The 
incident in Kaiga happened when pre-stressing was partial. 
  Enquiries at the site revealed that chunks of concrete from 
the under-side of inner containment dome came tumbling down from 
a height of 40 metres at 11:40 a.m. and again at 12:40 p.m. on 
May 13. 
  The dome had used up 1300 tonnes of concrete and only eight 
percent of its (104 tonnes) had come down from 15 percent of the 
area and not 40 percent as reported by AERB, the experts said. 
  According to AERB, the dome collapsed because concrete was 
poured at different times instead of in "one go" giving rise to 
three "radial" joints not in the original design. AERB also 
alleged that the dome was pre-stressed by tensioning cables in a 
sequence different from the one suggested by STUPP consultations. 
  On the other hand, the expert committee has found that the 
tensioning sequence had not been altered and "the concrete pours 
had been done with the approval of the designers." 
  Contrary to the AERB's assertion that the radial joints led 
to dome collapse, the project engineer pointed out that no 
concrete had peeled off the joints that were still intact. 
  FIRST INCIDENT: Although it is the first incident of its 
kind in India pre-stressed domes under construction had failed 
at least in two place in the United States, according to Mr. 
Surendar. 
  Beginning with the Madras atomic plant, all nuclear power 
reactors in India have been using pre-stressed structures for 
containment. The one under construction in Kaiga was the fifth 
pre-stressed dome designed by the same consultant. 
  Mr. Surendar said that Kaiga dome was slightly different 
from 
others in the sense it provided four holes of 4.2 metres 
diameter each for lowering steam generators and taking them out 
to facilitate servicing and repairs. He, however, ruled out any 
connection between provision of these holes and the dome 
collapse. 
  The only other difference is that while the Madras dome was 
designed to withstand an internal pressure of only 16 pound per 
square inch, the Kaiga dome was designed for 25 pounds. This 
necessitated the use of very high tensional force (280 tonnes 
per square centimetre) on the cables used for pre-stressing the 
concrete. The force used for pre-stressing Madras dome was 
about 40 tonnes per square cm.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Security Council is Murdering Security"] </F>
  [Text] The concealed U.S. hands, and the United States' 
flagrant involvement in fomenting the Yemeni war, have now begun 
to appear. This was to settle the old accounts of the Gulf war 
in reply to the Yemeni's pan-Arab position and to teach the 
Yemeni leadership a hard lesson for its pan-Arab role in the 
Mother of Battles. 
  When Yemen joined the Arab Cooperation Council, certain Gulf 
states were outraged because they considered it the backyard of 
the Gulf and the Roman theater in which they watch the rivers of 
blood flow to kill their boredom of money and oil. 
  Since the Gulf War ended, the United Stats has been hatching 
conspiracies to destroy the pan-Arab flame in Yemen and place 
its shores and Bab el-Mandeb under U.S. control to complete the 
occupation of the entire Arabian Peninsula and its long shores. 
  The UN Security Council's intervention in a domestic affair 
without the request of the responsible Yemeni party also comes 
to avenge the Jordanian stands, which certain Gulf states still 
abhor because of, first, Jordan's fostering of the Arab 
Cooperation Council; second, its rational position in the Gulf 
war; and, third, its honorable mediation to spare Yemeni blood. 
  The new imperialist conspiracy did not stop at fragmenting 
Yemen's unity, isolating it, and pushing it into the quagmire of 
a long civil war. It went beyond that to the objective of 
aborting the Jordanian mediation and destroying its plan for 
pan-Arab renaissance -- the Arab Cooperation Council, as well as 
destroying the effective Yemeni role in that Council. The more 
important objective of the conspiracy was to curb the Jordanian 
role and prevent it from contributing to the pan-Arab 
renaissance because the Arab Cooperation Council plan -- which 
certain Gulf states viewed as a challenge and an axis hostile to 
their dreams and encroachment on their influence zones, 
primarily Yemen -- was about to shatter the hopes of the U.S. 
imperialism to impose control on the Gulf. To avenge that 
position, certain Gulf states, acted quickly to complicate 
matters and push the situation in Yemen to a dead end. They used 
in the process certain Yemeni stooges to implement their 
conspiracy, with promises that they will be put in control if 
they implement their policies. 
  We denounce the UN Security Council's intervention in 
Yemen's 
internal affairs. We know in advance that any Arab subject that 
enters the Security Council will come out of it more complicated 
because the Security Council will not put things in the proper 
context and will, instead, complicate the problem, knowing that 
behind every Arab sedition there are American hands. 
  The Yemeni issue remains of concern to the legitimate Yemeni 
leadership and any foreign intervention in rejected. The 
Yemeni people will reject any Yemeni party that throws itself 
into the lap of U.S. imperialism to impose on its people a 
position that runs counter to their national aspirations. The 
Yemeni people have always been invulnerable to attempt at 
containment or hegemony and have crushed all conspiracies aimed 
at colonizing them and subjugating them to foreign hegemony. 
  We urge the Yemeni people and leadership to deny the 
conspirators every opportunity and to adhere to Yemen unity. We 
also urge them to utilize every chance for dialogue in order to 
foil the evil conspiracies and abort the big sedition.

  [Text] Amman--The 17th ministerial session of the UN 
Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, ESCWA, 
yesterday evening approved a report submitted by Dr. Sabah 
Baqjaji, the Commission's executive secretary, on the economic 
and social situation of the Syrian Arab citizens under Israeli 
occupation in the occupied Golan. After its approval yesterday, 
this report became one of the UN documents condemning the savage 
practices of the Israeli occupation authorities in the occupied 
Golan, Israel's violations of basic human rights, and Israel's 
looting of the occupied Golan's water and agricultural 
resources, as well as the building of illegal settlements in the 
Golan. 
  The session also approved reports on the Palestinian Arab 
people's situation in the occupied territories, the 
reconstruction of Lebanon, and cooperation among ESCWA member 
states on joint water resources, environment, continued 
development, and trade exchanges. 
  The participants in the session elected 'Abd-al-Rahman 
Madani, the [Syrian] irrigation minister and head of the Syrian 
delegation, as first deputy at the session. The ministerial 
session is scheduled to continue its meetings today in order to 
finish discussing the topics on the agenda, led by locating a 
permanent headquarters for ESCWA. Jordan, Qatar, and Lebanon 
offered to host this headquarters on a permanent basis. 
  The Syrian Arab delegation shared in introducing several 
amendments to phrases in the submitted reports. In their 
entirety, these amendments focused on canceling any phrase that 
may give the impression that there is support for the 
multilateral negotiations, particularly the issue of common 
waters.

<F P=106> ["Special Report" for the JORDAN TIMES by Natasha Bukhari] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Heads of the delegations of member states to 
the 17th ministerial session of the U.N. Economic and Social 
Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) Monday voted to relocate the 
commission's headquarters from Amman to Beirut. 
  Informed sources told the JORDAN TIMES that the votes in 
favour of the move to Lebanon were made by Saudi Arabia, the 
United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Syria, Kuwait, Egypt and 
Lebanon. 
  ESCWA headquarters was initially situated in Beirut, but was 
moved to Baghdad after the outbreak of the Lebanese civil war. 
It was then moved to Amman in the aftermath of the Iraqi 
invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. 
  Iraq, voted alone to return the headquarters to Baghdad, 
said 
the sources. 
  Qatar voted to have the headquarters located in Doha, and 
Oman abstained from the voting. 
  Votes in favour of maintaining the commission's headquarters 
in Amman, according to sources, were cast by Yemen, Palestine 
and Jordan. 
  Jordan sought to call for a postponement of the vote, but of 
the seven votes needed to move to postponement, explained the 
sources, only six were cast in favour. A yes vote for 
postponement by Egypt would have tipped the balance for Jordan, 
added the sources. 
  According to the sources, the committee which reported to 
the 
closed meeting expressed apprehensions and reservations about 
moving the headquarters out of Jordan. 
  The move, sources said, is expected to take place in two 
years. 
  Earlier, participants to the ESCWA ministerial session 
discussed the restructuring and revitalisation of the United 
Nations in the economic and social fields, revision of the 
medium term plan for the period 1992-1997 and revision of the 
programme of work and priorities for the biennium 1996-1997. 
  During discussions on the designation of sectoral focal 
points of the commission's economic and social development 
programme, participants agreed that a general coordination plan 
between member states and their governments has to be structured. 
  "It is agreed that we need to establish bridges of 
communications between the concerned parties" to make possible 
the application of ESCWA programmes, said Minister of Planning 
Ziyad Fariz who is heading the session. 
  Iraqi, Syrian, Egyptian and Qatari representatives stressed 
the importance of making comprehensive research studies on the 
exploitation of water in the region, saying that the issue of 
water management is one of the most vital points in the regions' 
economic relations. 
  Also on Monday's agenda was the financial status of the 
commission's programmes. 
  ESCWA Chief Administration John Truman said the initial 
appropriations for ESCWA's regular budget for the biennium 
1992-1993 approved by the General Assebly amounted to $US 
50,660,600. In 1993, he added, the commission estimated a 
saving of $US 12,432,700 from this initial appropriation. 
  They include "a freeze on recruitment, restrictions on 
travel 
of staff on official business, restrictions on the hiring of 
consultants, differences in post-adjustment for the professional 
staff between Iraq and Jordan, and differences in General 
Service salary scale between Iraq and Jordan." 
  The increasingly serious financial crisis faced by the 
United 
Nations in recent years is clearly reflected in the decreasing 
amounts allocated to ESCWA by the major sources of 
extrabudgetary funds, Mr. Truman said. The major sources of 
extrabudgetary funds for the past four bienniums have been the 
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations 
Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations Development Fund for 
Women (UNIFEM), the government of the Netherlands and the 
government of France. 
  Yet, contributions from these sources have steadily 
declined. 
In the biennium 1992-1993, these resources amount to $US 
1,218,350. 
  The financial situation of the regular budget was also 
addressed. Mr. Truman stressed the need for member states to 
"pay their contributions as soon as possible," as the financial 
situation is only manageable until August 1994. 
  The work of the 17th sesion, which addresses economic and 
social development programmes for its 13 member states, will be 
concluded today after delegations from the representative 
countries adopt the report of the commission on the session.

  [Text] Minister of Tourism and Antiquities Dr. Muhammad 
'Affash al-'Adwan and his Palestinian counterpart, Ilyas Frayj, 
have expressed a desire to boost relations between the two 
brotherly peoples in all fields, especially in tourism and 
antiquities. At a meeting in Amman today, they reviewed the 
state of the tourist industry in Jordan and future ties between 
Jordan and the Palestinian National Authority [PNA]. 
  [Begin recording] [Frayj] The tourist industries in Jordan 
and Palestine complement each other. Both sides, therefore, 
have a vested interest in promoting the industry here in Jordan 
and in Palestine. In my opinion, the future promises to be 
lucrative for both the Jordanian and Palestinian peoples. This 
region is home to the most important sacred and archaeological 
sites in the world. I anticipate a booming tourist industry. 
In a year or two a million or so tourists will be visiting 
Jordan and Palestine annually. 
  [Al-'Adwan] I have expressed our full readiness to support 
our Palestinian brothers, especially at this stage when they are 
planning to set up new institutions. We also told them we would 
be ready to provide training for our brother Palestinians in the 
tourism and archaeology industries. [end recording] 
  At the end of the meeting, the sides agreed to set up a 
joint 
committee to formulate an executive program for the full range 
of cooperation in the tourist industry between Jordan and the 
Palestinian National Authority.

  [Text] The Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan has issued a 
statement about what it described as a retreat in the democratic 
march. 
  The statement said that "the manifestations and aspects of 
the retreats in the democratic approach include the dissolution 
of the House of Representatives before the expiration of its 
constitutional term, the amendment of the election law, arrests, 
interference in the work of the trade unions, and the 
dissolution of many municipal councils." 
  The statement said that despite the existence of certain 
institutions and forms of democratic life, one can see and feel 
what the statement described as retreats and setbacks which "do 
not conform to the principle of [Islamic] consultation [shura]." 
  The statement called for reevaluating these practices and 
adopting means and mechanisms to strengthen what the statement 
called the democratic shura principle and to prevent all forms 
of corruption and oppression so that Jordan might enjoy security 
and stability.

<F P=106> [Special to the JORDAN TIMES by Sa'idah Kilani] </F>
  [Text] The democratic process in Jordan, a major stride in 
the history of the country and the region, is no more than a 
political overturn that is likely to be reversed, according to 
Jordanian specialists. 
  "The status quo is a transitory state between predemocracy 
and democracy, but staying in the same place for a long time is 
equivalent to a reversal (to the original status)," said Jamil 
al-Nimri, former chief editor of the opposition weekly AL-AHALI 
newspaper. "The presence of the old authority apparatus in 
power means the collapse of the democratic regime." 
  In a conference entitled the Jordanian Democratic Path, 
organized jointly by al-Urdun al-Jadid [New Jordan] Research 
Centre and Friedrich Ebert Foundation and held at the Forte 
Grand hotel, Mr. al-Nimri said that enormous restrictions were 
introduced by the laws enacted after the introduction of 
democracy in 1989 and they can only negatively influence the 
progress of democracy in the Jordanian society. These laws, he 
said, include the political parties law, the press and 
publications law, the defence law, the state security courts 
law, and the elections law. He said they include articles that 
can be used by the government to restrict freedoms. 
  Mr. al-Nimri, who is a member of the leftist party Hashd 
said 
the press and publications law "was used to file numerous cases 
against newspapers for publishing articles that were meant to 
enhance freedoms of expression. 
  "Those negative developments had decreased the people's 
interest in democracy and weakened the party life in the country 
which is not in favour of social and democratic growth." Mr. 
al-Nimri said. 
  The president of the Writers Association, Mu'nis al-Razzazz, 
said one of the most important factors influencing the "relative 
Jordanian democratic openness" is the developments in the 
Palestinian issue. 
  He said that Jordan's envisioned role in the process had 
hastened the introduction of democracy. Mr. al-Razzazz, 
Jordan's leading novelist and a leading columnist, pointed to 
several other factors that he considered crucial to the 
enhancement of democracy in Jordan. First, the failure of 
political parties in assuming a leading role in the Jordanian 
political life; setbacks that influenced the democratic march 
"that the country was not able to overcome were it not for the 
intervention of the King personally", the lack of participation 
of the intelligentsia in the civil society organisations such as 
Centre for the Study of Freedom, Democracy and human Rights in 
the Arab World. 
  "And perhaps the recent dramatic developments of the 
Palestinian issue can be considered as key factors leading to 
this reversal," he concluded. 
  Participants in the three-day conference sought to determine 
whether April 1987 riots were behind the introduction of 
democracy or not. Most said they feared a setback. 
  "More than four decades have passed since the promulgation 
of 
the Constitution, and, during this period, the Jordanian society 
had developed politically, socially and economically that it 
became necessary to amend and introduce changes to certain 
articles," Sulayman Sweiss said during the evening session. 
  Dr. Sweiss, a prominent human rights advocate, cited the 
election law, prisons law, the press and publications law and 
the labour law as legislations that include articles that 
contradict human rights principles, and, therefore, should be 
amended. 
  "Official statements regarding human rights and democracy 
are 
almost close to slogans...what we direly need is serious and 
pragmatic steps and political will to translate official 
commitment to human rights into a reality," he added. 
  According to Dr. Sweiss, a national strategy should be 
adopted to enhance and develop human rights causes. Such a 
strategy, he said, should include the appointment of a national 
commissioner to protect human rights; official response to 
complaints filed by human rights organisations; the introduction 
of human rights principles in the school curriculum; the 
establishment of centres for enhancing democracy and human 
rights; and drafting a comprehensive plan for legal reform in 
order to revise laws and legislations in conformity with human 
rights principles and conventions. 
  Musa al-Kilani, chief editor of AL-DUSTUR newspaper, 
believes 
that the democratic process is going to be slow but steady. 
While pointing to several factors that hamper the enhancement 
of the democratisation process that he thought were beyond the 
government control, Dr. al-Kilani also criticised government 
hegemony over the media. 
  "The most powerful weapon the government uses in its control 
of the radio and television and the Jordan News Agency (PETRA), 
which are all promoting the government's achievements and its 
decisions," Dr. al-Kilani said. 
  "As for those newspapers that oppose the government's 
policies, the government resorts to old laws to punish them," he 
added. "It would be sufficient to know that there are currently 
50 cases filed against newspapers"

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Algerian Army Occupies Police </F>
Station Headed by Armed Group Leader"] 
  [Excerpt] Algiers, AL-HAYAH -- Reliable sources told 
AL-HAYAH in Algiers yesterday that Army units had occupied a 
police station in the capital after discovering that its head is 
the amir [leader] of an armed group. 
  The sources pointed out that the Army discovered the armed 
cell in a police station covering the Bab El Oued district in 
the capital. The sources added that the head of the station in 
Bab El Oued is the amir of an armed group that has carried out 
several terrorist operations in the area. The Army, some of 
whose units occupied the police station, has begun an 
investigation into the clues of the armed groups' infiltration 
of security units. Information not confirmed by security sources 
indicates that the armed groups are indeed infiltrating security 
services and "recruiting" some "security men." 
  Meanwhile, Republican Guard units supported by tanks 
continue 
to besiege the Ben Zerga-Bordj El Bahri area, 15 km northeast of 
the capital. Eyewitnesses told AL-HAYAH that security forces, 
which included elements from the gendarmerie and the Republican 
Guard, have destroyed a center used by an "armed group" believed 
to be linked with the assassination of former Prime Minister 
Kasdi Merbah. 
  At another level, the "al-Nasr Battalion" belonging to the 
"Islamic Salvation Army" has denied the contents of the 
statement issued by the "Armed Islamic Group" about the 
unification of the Islamic Salvation Front and the Islamic State 
Movement under its banner. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Announcer-read commentary] </F>
  [Text] At a time when Algeria is making every possible 
effort to solve all the problems of its multifaceted crisis, 
statements emerge from overseas trying to turn Algeria into a 
test ground and political laboratory in an attempt to cover 
blatantly their rivalry over Algeria and the region. 
  It is normal for crises to occur in societies and states, 
but 
the increasing number of those who have ambitions in Algeria is 
not normal. 
  Circles and institutes in capitals of world superpowers made 
various speculations about our future. But the prescription 
they have made out for us to pull through the crisis does not 
succeed in concealing the political, economic, and financial 
interests of these circles themselves. This prescription might 
then be described as a talisman of interests by contemporary 
oracles competing to interpret Algeria's crisis according to 
their self interests. 
  It is true Algeria is in need of economic help to carry out 
a 
series of comprehensive economic reforms to pull through the 
crisis. Algeria has negotiated with international institutions 
in this regard and for this purpose. The president made this 
clear in his meeting with the diplomatic corps by saying 
Algeria's crisis was not eternal but a temporary one Algeria was 
capable of pulling through. 
  We should, nevertheless, wonder about the responsibility and 
duty of international institutions that supposedly are a result 
of civilized international relations. Algeria's strategic and 
economic weight is very well known to governments and investors 
who are leading the free economy or the market economy on a 
world scale. 
  Algeria's standing in the whole of North Africa should not 
be 
underestimated, and its stability positively reflects on the 
whole region. In fact statements that interfere in our internal 
affairs -- statements that unfortunately are sometimes reported 
by our newspapers -- only prove the importance of Algeria. 
Algeria is not an American-European spoil of war. Algeria 
today is composed of a number of functional institutions and 
efforts are being made to combat the ordeal from which Algeria 
is emerging.

  [Text] A source at the General People's Committee for Unity 
made the following statement: 
  The Zionist enemy continues its ongoing aggression against 
the Arab nation, thus violating its sovereignty and territories, 
using to this end its arsenal and weapons of destruction that 
are supplied to it by Western states, at their forefront the 
U.S. Government. This represents a blatant defiance against all 
international resolutions. What is more, they intensify this 
plot whenever they wish to impose more hegemony against Arab 
regimes and against the will of the masses that reject defeat 
and submission. 
  The violations and aggression taking place these days 
against 
the sovereignty of Lebanon and its Arab people should be used as 
a means to resist all attempts of submission and the imposition 
of the fait accompli. This should be faced up to with a 
responsibility as stipulated by Arab charters, foremost of which 
the Arab joint defense accord; there should be an end to the 
aggression and barbaric attacks of the Israelis that target 
civilians as well as undermining the spirit of the fierce 
resistance against the Zionist presence and occupation. 
  The General People's Committee for Unity in the Great 
Jamahiriyah, stemming from the pillars of the revolution of the 
Great al-Fatih, and in implementation of the resolutions of the 
Basic People's Congresses that stressed the need to confront the 
continuing imperialist-backed Israeli aggression against the 
Arab nation, denounces the Israeli terrorism that is represented 
in the continuing occupation of Arab territories stretching from 
Southern Lebanon to the Golan Heights and the region of Um 
al-Rafrash. It also denounces the practice of hostilities and 
kidnap of civilians; yet nobody dares to restrain the Israelis 
from carrying out such practices. We call for the 
implementation of Arab charters and accords to face up to this 
aggression.

  [Text] Tripoli, al Maa'[May] 26 JANA (Arab Maghreb Union 
Pool)--The secretary of the General Peoples Committee for Unity 
met with the members of the Libyan-Algerian economic working 
team which is entrusted with the task of studying the various 
aspects of co-operation and integration between the Great 
Jamahiriyah and Algeria in preparation for the convening of the 
joint higher committee next month. 
  During this meeting, the secretary stressed that there was 
no 
alternative to serious work to achieve Arab unity to confront 
the political, social, and economic challenges facing the Arab 
world as part of the attempts by the imperialists to dominate 
it. He emphasised the need for the goal of unity to be sacred 
goal which requires extensive efforts. 
  He said that the deep relationship and joint goals which 
bind 
the al Fateh revolution and the Algerian revolution will help 
them to [word indistinct] a prominent role in this sphere. He 
ended by saying that co-operation, integration and unity could 
not solve the problems of reaction and dependence which the 
imperialists are trying to impose. 
  The secretary said that the Great Jamahiriyah, acted in line 
with its responsibilities towards African nations [words 
indistinct] assistance and support for the African liberation 
movements with the aim of enhancing the movements of total 
struggle which had been led by Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation 
Front] movement in Mozambique, Zano and Zabo movements in 
Zimbabwe, SWAPO [South-West African People's Organization] 
movement in Namibia, the A.N.C and the Pan African Congress in 
South Africa. 
  He went on to say that the liberation movements, following 
the elimination of colonialism and racism have become states and 
the enemies of yesterday which are forgetting their unholy 
alliance with colonialism and racism, try to woo these states 
and offer assistance to them while trying to forget that the 
blockade imposed on the great socialist People's Libyan Arab 
Jamahiriyah was caused by its support and assistance for the 
African liberation movements. He confirmed that the 
emancipation of South Africa from racism paves the way of the 
future victory and triumph of the Arab people in occupied 
Palestine who are struggling against the Zionist racist. He said 
that our jubilation will not complete unless after the 
achievement of the final victory for the Arab Palestinian people 
and after all Arab occupied territories are regained. 
  He said in accordance with the African brethren and good 
neighbourlyhood spirit agreement had been reached between the 
Great Jamahiriyah and Chad to implement the decision of the 
International Court of Justice. 
  The secretary said: All [word indistinct] may remember, more 
than anyone else the nature of conflict between my country and 
the three Western states and the practical steps taken by Libya 
to find a peaceful settlement for this dispute and its 
acceptance to deal with the Security Council Resolution No. 731 
as nothing remains for the complete implementation generally 
except the two suspects standing trial before the court which is 
based on the legal principle that forbids the surrendering of 
nationals for other states to try them outside its territory, 
with the preparedness to let the two suspects stand [words 
indistinct] and just court to be agreed upon by the parties with 
the aim of establishing the truth and try them at the quarters 
of the International Court of Justice but the other concerned 
patriots did not respond favourably with these practical 
initiatives offered by the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab 
Jamahiriyah which aim at finding a fair and just settlement to 
satisfy the concerned parties particularly in the wake of the 
solid support of the international and regional organization for 
the position of the Great Jamahiriyah and the calls for the 
non-escalation of the dispute and the need to arrive at a 
peaceful settlement to satisfy all parties. 
  The secretary of the General People's Committee for Foreign 
Liaison and International Cooperation paid tribute to the 
positive role played by the O.A.U. towards this issue which is 
represented by the decision taken in the 58th. session 
unanimously by the ministerial council in Cairo and ratified by 
the 29th. summit of African presidents which called for urging 
the U.N. Security Council to review Resolution No. 748 and lift 
the sanctions imposed on Libya in appreciation of the positive 
initiatives offered by the Great Jamahiriyah to settle the 
crisis. The reduced African summit held in Cairo in al Kanoun 
(December) 1993 made an appeal for a peaceful settlement for the 
conflict and called for a fair trial of the two suspects in a 
neutral state. 
  The secretary of the General People's Committee for Foreign 
Liaison and International Cooperation appeal to the sisterly 
states, friendly countries, the conscience of the world, the 
intellectuals and jurists in the world to tackle and confront 
this flagrant violation for the international law and the United 
Nations Charter so that the Security Council may not be 
transformed [word indistinct] council against smaller countries. 
  He concluded his speech by saying that present conditions 
and 
international developments oblige us to be more vigilant to 
defend our causes and issues and to act towards settling all our 
disputes within the framework of the Organization of African 
Unity and to seek the settlement of the debts crisis which is 
posing heavily on most of our countries. The confrontation of 
these challenges and others will not be achieved unless through 
joint will, solid collective resolve and commitment to total 
African unity.

  [Text] The 16th regional seminar of the revolutionary 
committees movement began this afternoon under the theme: For 
revolutionary tasks of defiance and confrontation. The seminar 
is being held from 30 May to 1 June. The agenda consists of 
three topics: the local topic, the pan-Arab topic, and the 
international topic. 
  The local topic is focussed on work for further improving 
production capacity, practicing self-reliance, and fortifying 
the coast. The pan-Arab topic consists of boosting the morale 
of the Arab masses, exposing the aims of colonialism, sticking 
to the pan-Arab spirit, working for destroying the artificial 
borders, and forging alliance with the active forces in the Arab 
homeland. As for the international topic, it consists in 
working for broadening the international front, forging alliance 
with the small peoples which struggle for their freedom, and 
standing with the peoples that love peace based on justice and 
respect of freedom, sovereignty, and the options of peoples. 
  The meeting of the 16th seminar of the revolutionary 
committees movement comes at a time when the Arab Libyan people 
have declared their historic resolution of defiance and 
preparedness for confrontation, as shown by the great defiance 
manifestations in which the masses took to the streets to 
receive the brother of the revolution everywhere in the Arab 
Libyan territory.

  [Text] Aggressive air raids of the Zionist fighter planes 
on suburbs of Ba'lbak and one of the Hezbollah centres in the 
eastern region of Lebanon have left about 100 casualties so far. 
Political analysts believe that the Zionist regime's impudence 
in the attack on Lebanon, which is contrary to all the 
international conventions, is the natural outcome of the UN 
Security Council's double-dealing in the face of this regime's 
repeated acts of aggression. Thanks to U.S. support for 
Tel-Aviv, the Security Council, which is supposed to maintain 
international security, either ignores criminal acts of the 
Zionist regime or releases a vague and ineffective resolution. 
  Several days ago the Zionist regime, within the framework of 
its hostile behavior against the regional countries, abducted a 
leader of the Believers Resistance Group from his residence and 
took him to the occupied territories. Continuation of these 
acts of aggression proves the point that, contrary to its 
peace-seeking slogans, the Zionist regime's criminal behavior 
remains. Neither is the Zionist regime's claim that it 
launched an attack on the Hezbollah center in retaliation for 
jihad operations by the Islamic resistance combatants acceptable 
under any logic: The Zionist regime has occupied some part of 
the Lebanese territory, and the Lebanese people enjoy the 
legitimate right, in accordance with international regulations, 
to fight for the liberation of their occupied territories, 
whereas the Zionist regime is forbidden from retaliation even if 
it is attacked in Lebanon. 
  It is obvious that the renewed silence of the Security 
Council vis-a-vis today's aggression of the Zionist regime, 
which brought death and destruction to another group of 
Lebanon's innocent people, once again proves the fact to the 
people of the world that the existing international system, 
comprising the UN as a major part of the system, is incapable of 
defending nations, thanks to the bullying structure of the 
system. The system is incapable of bringing real peace and 
security to every corner of the world.

  [Text] Tehran, June 2, (IRNA) -- A Foreign Ministry 
spokesman here Thursday [2 June] reiterated Iran's policy of 
establishing friendly ties with the Persian Gulf states and said 
the country is ready to hold direct and bilateral talks with the 
United Arab Emirates [UAE] to eliminate the existing 
misunderstandings. 
  The spokesman, Mahmud Mohammadi, was referring to the recent 
statements by the UAE Crown Prince Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Zayid Al 
Nuhayyan who has called for the establishment of friendly ties 
with Tehran but asked Iran to give up the three islands of Abu 
Musa, the Lesser and the Greater Tonbs. 
  Mohammadi further added that the Islamic Republic of Iran 
attaches great importance to the security and stability of the 
region. 
  He stressed that Iran had always tried to maintain security 
and stability in the region and under critical conditions had 
even welcomed cooperation of other countries in thwarting 
threats against the collective regional interests. 
  The spokesman said that Shaykh Khalifah's statements 
regarding the three Iranian islands were in contradiction with 
the UAE's call for the establishment of friendly ties with Iran. 
  Mohammadi termed as incorrect the report aired by Agence 
France Presse (AFP) on the meeting between the Iranian and 
Egyptian Foreign ministers in the course of the on-going 
Non-alignment Movement [NAM] ministerial session, convened in 
Cairo Tuesday. 
  AFP had reported that Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa 
had 
expressed willingness to confer with his Iranian counterpart 
'Ali Akbar Velayati and quoted Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman 
as saying that Velayati would not meet any Egyptian official. 
  He said that to meet with foreign ministers of other 
countries at multilateral sessions and holding talks with them 
is quite customary. 
  Stressing that Iran and Egypt are two influential members of 
the movement, the spokesman said that during the NAM meeting the 
two foreign ministers can discuss major issues such as situation 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina, disarmament and restructuring of the U.N. 
organization.

  [Text] Tehran, June 1, IRNA -- Majles Speaker Hojjat 
ol-Eslam 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri on Wednesday strongly criticized 
the Saudi Government for its position towards Iran, accusing it 
of complicity in various troubles in the region especially in 
Yemeni crisis. 
  The Majles speaker also charged the Riyadh government with 
inciting Iran's neighboring countries against Tehran under the 
pretext of the three Iranian islands in the Persian Gulf. 
  The three Iranian islands of Abu Musa, Lesser Tunb and 
Greater Tunb are of great importance to the people and 
government of the Islamic Republic, he said. 
  "A nation who has defended its territory by dedicating 
thousands of martyrs, will never back down on the issue and such 
mischievous acts are undoubtedly not in the interest of Saudi 
Arabia and other regional governments," Nateq-Nuri said at the 
Majles. 
  It is not the first time that Saudi Arabia, because of its 
wrong and illogical prejudices has taken position against Iran, 
he said, adding that already Riyadh had taken the side of Iraq 
during its 8 year war against Iran. 
  Commenting on the civil war and fratricide in Afghanistan, 
the speaker said the conflict there had no justification but 
incited by hegemonism and carnal desires. 
  He called on all the warring sides in Afghanistan to quit 
hegemonism and try instead to unite and rebuild their war-torn 
country. 
  Hojjat ol-Eslam Nateq-Nuri instructed the Foreign Ministry 
to 
follow up the issue of Afghanistan and do its best to end the 
ongoing war and fratricide in that country. 
  Elsewhere in his speech, the speaker lashed out at 
international circles particularly the U.N. and its secretary 
general for their silence on Israel's recent kidnapping of 
Mustafa Dirani from his home in Lebanon.

  [Text] A large number of our country's pilgrims have 
returned to Iran during the past few days after their pilgrimage 
to the house of God. Even though our countries' pilgrims were 
not allowed by the Saudi regime to carry out their 
political-religious ceremony of the disavowal of pagans, their 
self-restraint and the meaningless silence of the pilgrims from 
Iran and the other Islamic countries were the best ways to 
awaken the Muslims of the world. 
  Saudi Arabia's prevention of the Ibrahimite ceremony of the 
disavowal of pagans and the silence that spread during the Hajj 
ceremonies because of it will undoubtedly have their impact. 
The non-Iranian pilgrims will ask themselves the reason for the 
police atmosphere that ruled the ceremonies and the policy of 
intimidating the pilgrims. 
  Despite the claim that it would not disrupt the pilgrims' 
programs, the Saudi Government did create problems. After 
returning to Tehran, the representative of the supreme leader 
and the head of the Iranian pilgrims referred to the siege on 
his mission and stated that this act by Saudi Arabia upset the 
performance of the Hajj rites by the pilgrims. He added that 
members of the mission were even prevented from entering Medina, 
contrary to the agreement that had been reached. 
  The unfavorable atmosphere that upset the Hajj ceremonies 
shows the weakness of the Saudi Government in managing the holy 
shrines, and the news about this will undoubtedly not have good 
consequences for the unfit custodian of the house of God. The 
message from King Fahd of Saudi Arabia during this year's Hajj 
and his unity-breaking remarks put an end to many doubts and 
revealed the face of the major mentors of this regime, who 
undoubtedly have a long record of plotting against the Muslims 
in the region and in the world of Islam. 
  With the exposure of this behavior, the world of Islam will 
ask itself whose hands the house of God is in and what meaning 
this resistance against religious-political ceremonies and the 
expression of disgust toward America and Israel will have. In 
other words, the irresponsible acts by the Saudi Government 
further disgraces those who have diverted from the true path in 
Islamic society and doubles the brightness of the front of 
justice. The repercussions that the obstructionist acts by the 
Saudi police will have will not be very favorable, even in Saudi 
society, and everyone will realize why the Saudi regime feared 
the disavowal of pagans ceremony. 
  In view of regional developments and the compromise trend in 
the Middle East, Islamic nations are facing more serious threats 
and plots that will not only hold the perpetrators of discordant 
acts answerable to history but will also list their acts among 
the Muslims of the world as contrary to Islamic interests.

  [Text] A spokesman for our country's Foreign Ministry 
announced today that the first secretary -- the second-ranking 
official of the British Embassy in Tehran -- must leave Iran 
within a month because of actions and behavior contrary to 
diplomatic principles and contact with terrorist groups opposed 
to the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  Denying a claim by the British Foreign Office on the 
distribution of forged documents by an Iranian diplomat 
regarding British activities and stance on Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
he said: British policies on events in Bosnian-Herzegovina are 
so obvious that there is no need to divulge them to 
international public opinion and the world's Muslims. 
  He added: British Foreign Office Minister Douglas Hogg's 
views and the raising of groundless allegations against the 
Islamic Republic of Iran come at a time when known international 
terrorists -- such as the Hypocrites [Mojahedin Khalq 
Organization] -- while being active in Britain, make use of that 
country's facilities and resources for the propagation of 
terrorism. 
  Concluding, the Foreign Ministry spokesman said: It is a 
source of great regret that Britain embarked on installing 
listening devices in the Islamic Republic of Iran's Embassy 
contrary to international law, and in response to its illegal 
act resorts to the reiteration of its futile allegations against 
Iran.

  [Text] London, June 1, IRNA -- The Foreign Office confirmed 
Wednesday [1 June] that its deputy head at its embassy in Tehran 
had been expelled in retaliation for last week's expulsion of an 
Iranian first secretary from London. 
  A spokesman claimed that the removal of Hamish Cowell was 
"totally unjustified." At the same time, he tried to defend the 
feeble excuse for Britain's unilateral action when ordering 
Vahid Bolurchi to leave last Thursday. 
  The official reason for the expulsion of the Iranian first 
secretary was said to be because of attempts by embassy staff to 
distribute "forged documents" about the UK's anti-Muslim policy 
in Bosnia, which is universally known. 
  The raising of such an excuse shows British sensitivity 
about 
its failed policy, which frequently comes under attack from the 
Bosnian Government itself for the way in which London is 
attempting to impose a settlement by rewarding the Serb 
aggressors. 
  The Foreign Office spokesman maintained it wished to keep 
quiet its initial provocative move against Iran in the hope of 
limiting publicity, but the real motive may be more associated 
with trying to hide the embarrassment of a bug being found in 
the Iranian Embassy. 
  Britain's strained relations with Iran have been dominated 
by 
a history of tit-for-tat exchanges that have always proved a 
fruitless ploy for the UK. At one stage prior to Tehran 
severing ties in 1989, representation was reduced to only a 
mission head. 
  The new expulsions cut the current number of diplomats to 14 
and indications are in the present climate they may not end 
there with a number of Iranian parliamentarians already calling 
for relations with Britain to be reviewed.

<F P=106> [Speech by Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i, leader of the Islamic </F>
revolution, at a meeting of Majles deputies marking the 
anniversary of the formation of the Majles; in Tehran -- 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God, the compassionate, the 
merciful. I welcome you warmly, dear brothers and sisters. We 
are pleased that another year has passed since the formation of 
our honorable Islamic Majles. [passage omitted] 
  What I deem necessary to mention at this juncture is that 
the 
slightest issue that might give hope to the enemy should not 
emerge from the centers of responsibility. We have nothing to 
do with irresponsible individuals. The government and Majles 
should work shoulder to shoulder. The Majles should be a source 
of help for the government. This is not a new idea. It has 
been like this for centuries. If the people's deputies do not 
render assistance to the governments, the governments are unable 
to carry out their work. The Majles is a legislative center. 
The power of restraint is in the hands of the Majles. The 
Majles has its foot on the brakes too. If a government moves 
and you put your foot on the brake, it cannot move. If the 
Majles were to neglect to direct the government, no good result 
would be gained. Directing should be carried out. Attention 
should always be paid to the issue of independence and sense of 
responsibility and bravery. But a situation should not arise in 
which a conflict may be felt between the government and the 
Majles, lest one should think that there is conflict between 
these two. Today, too, thanks be to God, is not like that. Of 
course the enemy may magnify any small matter tenfold, sometimes 
a hundredfold. However, praise be to God, the Majles supports 
the government and the government too works toward the 
legislative process of the Majles. The running of the country 
is a difficult task. [passage omitted] 
  Of course one should never defend mistakes that mainly take 
place in the second and third ranks of the government. No one 
should defend them. If someone makes a mistake, it should be 
pointed out to him. Thanks be to God, our president is a 
knowledgeable scholar, is aware of changing times, and is in 
control of the running of the country. Among all the people 
that are known to us, he has exceptional capabilities. He pays 
attention to all the affairs and the suggestions of the deputies 
will assist him too. You can make use of the instruments that 
the law has put in your hands, such as points of order, 
questions, and so on. You have these resources too. The most 
important instrument is the legislation, which guides the 
government on which directions to take, and the government has 
an obligation to obey. You can prevent mistakes by this means 
completely. 
  Today the situation is very sensitive. Today it is the turn 
of one of the most difficult tasks -- that is, the task of 
reconstruction. Destruction is much easier than construction. 
There is a difference between destroying a building that is 
collapsing and constructing a straight and powerful building. 
The first takes two days and the second might not be finished in 
two years. 
  It is a difficult time, difficult work. The foreign enemies 
are serious in their hostility too. You only observe a corner 
of their animosity in their propaganda. The esteemed deputies 
might of course have access to secret reports. Therefore, you 
see how much the enemy is trying to prevent the Islamic Republic 
from realizing its set aspirations. Under such circumstances, 
thanks be to God, we have this Majles that is alive, religious, 
committed, aware, familiar with its duty, and courageous; we 
have this capable and authoritative government; and we have this 
experienced president who has shown his presence in all the 
arenas. This is a good basis for work. We should go forward 
with speed and power, God willing. Nothing should prevent us 
from undertaking correct action. [passage omitted] 
  I hope that all the brothers and sisters will be successful. 
I hope that the esteemed speaker of the Majles -- thanks be to 
God that the same shining face has been appointed -- and other 
esteemed deputies who have responsibilities within the Majles 
will be successful. God will award you further successes. 
[passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Thousands of Iranian and foreign pilgrims to the 
blessed shrine of his eminence Imam Khomeyni, may he be admitted 
to God's paradise, this morning met the Vali-e Amr of Muslims, 
his eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i. 
  In this meeting, the eminent leader made a speech and said: 
In the most sonorous way, Imam Khomeyni put forward for the 
people of the world the issue of managing the affairs of life on 
the basis of the sovereignty of Islam and the fusion of religion 
and politics. The rejuvenation of this Islamic concept is the 
greatest lesson of the blessed life of the esteemed Imam. 
[passage omitted] 
  The eminent leader condemned the step by the pseudo-clerics 
of the royal court [darbar] toward reiterating the utterances 
concerning the need to separate religion from politics. He said 
that such moves constitute a slander against the lofty religion 
of Islam. He added: By Imam Khomeyni's efforts, resilience, 
and insight, today Islam has become a political entity in the 
Islamic Republic of Iran. However, the West, and worse still a 
group of the pseudo-clerics and the royal court-affiliated 
clergy in God's holy shrine [Mecca] utter slander and calumny 
against God's religion. They claim that religion and politics 
are two separate entities. We are sorry that a number of 
leaders, kings, and statesmen of the Islamic world have joined 
ranks with the enemies of Islam. 
  His eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i considers Hajj as a stage 
for the presence of world Muslims, and as a forum that is to 
benefit the Islamic ummah. He said: The Almighty has decreed 
that declaration of disavowal of infidels should take place in 
the course of Hajj. This is because Hajj is a forum for the 
declaration of disavowal by Muslims. [sentence as heard]. 
[passage omitted] 
  In conclusion, his eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i stressed 
that 
the various brands of propaganda waged by Western governments 
against the Islamic Republic of Iran are all contrary to 
reality. He said: The antagonism and contempt of the 
colonialist powers against the Islamic Iran is rooted in the 
antagonism of the colonialists against the sovereignty of Islam. 
However, despite all the contempt, the government, officials, 
and the people of Iran are standing firm, with all their might, 
behind the sovereignty of God's religion and the implementation 
of divine strictures.

  [Text] Tehran, June 1, IRNA -- Minister of Information 
Hojjat-ol-Eslam 'Ali Fallahiyan said here today that security 
forces had identified and arrested the elements behind the 
recent bombing in Tehran. 
  Speaking at a press conference, he said Iraqi intelligence 
agents were directly involved in the bombing and two Iraqi 
officers, Abdul-Amir 'Ali and Raad Mostafa Fattah have been 
arrested who have admitted their terrorist actions. 
  He said the Iraqi regime has directly assigned its 
intelligence officers to plant bombs in Iranian large cities 
since last February after being disappointed with its internal 
agents in Iran. 
  Hojjat-ol-Eslam Fallahiyan said that Iraqi intelligence 
officers had carried 22 bombs, mostly magnetic into Iran, adding 
that 14 bombs had been seized by police. He said the terrorists 
exploded 4 bombs in the streets and investigations are underway 
to detect the others. Evidences indicate that the terrorists 
may have destroyed the other four bombs, he said. 
  Six internal elements nammed Shakour Rostami, Havas Azizi, 
Ali Behruzi, Ahmad Asghari, Davoud Jaafar and Nejad Faissal who 
were in contact with the Iraqi intelligence officers are now 
under arrest and have confessed to their charges. 
  The information minister showed a video-tape to reporters 
showing the confessions of the Iraqi intelligence officers and 
their internal elements in Iran. 
  On Iraq's objectives behind the terrorist actions, 
Fallahiyan 
said the Iraqi regime and the counterrevolutionary grouplets 
were trying to carry out explosions in Iran and attribute them 
to internal issues and pretend that the people were against the 
ruling system. 
  Asked about the Iranians living abroad, he said, "We welcome 
the return of our fellow-countrymen, but there is no compulsion 
in this regard." 
  The majority of those who live abroad have no special 
problem 
and travel freely, but, he said, those who have legal problems 
should refer to the judiciary. 
  About Saeedi Sirjani (a writer), he said he had been 
arrested 
for addiction and drug smuggling, but further inve stigations 
showed that he had cooperation with Savak (former regime's 
secret police). 
  He has been a drug addict for a long time, so it is natural 
that the addiction would lead him to some ethical weaknesses. 
  Saeedi Sirjani has had links with the western intelligence 
services as well and the matter will be disclosed after 
completion of the investigations, he said. 
  About the bugging of the Iranian embassy in London by the 
intelligence service of the United Kingdom, he said the 
information ministry had already received reports on the issue 
which was announced after official confirmation. 
  He said all the dimensions of the bugging of the Iranian 
embassy in London had not been disclosed yet due to security 
reasons. 
  He regretted that the UK government regarded the blatant 
violation of the international law in the embassy case as a 
matter of normalcy. 
  Asked about Iran-Turkey security relations, and the 
propaganda campaign of Turkish media on the alleged Iranian 
interference in internal affairs of that country, he said 
contacts between the officials of the two countries showed that 
Iran has not intervened in their domestice affairs and will not 
do so.

  [Text] By cutting more than 15 percent of the revenues and 
expenditures recommended by the government, the Majles has 
approved the 1373 [21 March 1994- 20 March 1995] budget bill. 
Most of the government's current and general expenses have been 
reduced compared to the year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994]. 
The defense budget was the only section whose increase the 
Majles did not oppose, increasing it by $850 million to $1.4 
billion while decreasing food subsidies from $1.2 billion to 
$800 million. 
  The first effect of the approved budget came before the 
beginning of the new year. The "Railroad of the Islamic 
Republic" increased by 30 to 50 percent ticket prices for 
various passenger trains during the New Year's holidays on the 
pretext of the "cutoff in government aid and subsidies." Then in 
the first days of the new year it announced that the new ticket 
prices would be permanent.

<F P=106> [Interview with Iranian Central Bank Governor Mohammad </F>
Hoseyn 'Adeli by unidentified correspondent on 28 May; place not 
given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] Dear viewers, as you heard in the bulletin, 
following the announcement of the new decisions taken by the 
committee for the regulation of the foreign exchange market -- 
which were adopted with the aim of limiting demand for foreign 
exchange and controlling exchange rate fluctuations -- Mohammad 
Hoseyn 'Adeli, the governor of the Central Bank, took part in an 
exclusive interview with our reporter this evening. We end this 
bulletin with this interview. Good night and may God keep. 
  [Correspondent] Please be so kind as to tell us about the 
reasons behind the new decisions, announced last night, adopted 
by Article Three, Clause 29 committee. [sentence as heard] 
  ['Adeli] In the name of God, the compassionate, the 
merciful. 
In view of the new possibilities established after the 
negotiations that we carried out with our foreign commercial 
partners, and in view of the fact that the banking system will 
be able to open letters of credit, and the fact that the new 
letters of credit issued during 1373 [beginning 21 March 94] 
will be paid at the appropriate time -- and, again, in view of 
the fact that we were also finding that some importers were 
turning to the open market for foreign exchange and that this 
was leading to an increase in the exchange rate, we came to the 
conclusion that there was no longer any reason why -- bearing in 
mind the new possibilities -- we should allow open market 
transactions to raise the exchange rate. A new decision was 
therefore adopted, according to which all importers will be able 
to carry out their work in the normal way, that is, via the 
banking system. 
  [Correspondent] Dr. 'Adeli, what difference, on the whole, 
is 
there between these new decisions and the previous ones? 
  ['Adeli] In fact, the new decisions represent no changes 
from 
the previous ones; it is rather the case that they are in line 
with previous decisions, where the idea was that we should limit 
demand on the open market for foreign exchange. These new 
decisions are in keeping with that idea and, with these 
decisions, a number of new ways have been foreseen for limiting 
demand on the open market for foreign exchange. The new 
decisions have two aspects: First, from now on all foreign 
exchange transactions relating to imports into the country will 
take place exclusively via the banking system and no one will be 
allowed to go to the open market for their foreign exchange. 
This is in line with the general policy that the government has 
been following during recent months; that is, limiting demand on 
the foreign exchange market. 
  The second aspect relates to the question of imports in 
exchange for exports. Previously, this existed in a formal 
sense only and, in reality, it was enough for an importer to 
purchase an authorization for exports and then go to the open 
market himself and buy foreign exchange. From now on, this 
process will be ruled out and an importer will now either have 
to purchase his foreign exchange from the banking system or he 
must buy actual foreign exchange from an exporter; that is, as 
long as an exporter's foreign exchange has not entered into the 
banking system, the exporter will not be allowed to sell it. In 
other words, the previous deposit slips that were bought and 
sold before can only be sold now along with the actual foreign 
exchange -- it will be actual foreign exchange that is bought 
and sold. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] One of the points referred to in the recent 
announcement of the new decisions was the issue of controlling 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations. To what extent do you think 
the new decisions will succeed in keeping the foreign exchange 
rate under control? 
  ['Adeli] It seems to us that importers who previously 
purchased foreign exchange on the market in order to send it 
abroad will, henceforth, be prevented from carrying out their 
transactions, because, if they buy foreign exchange on the open 
market, their imported goods will not be cleared from customs. 
Second, it has been stated that if someone buys foreign 
exchange on the open market and sends it abroad, that will be 
viewed as smuggling. In other words, sending foreign exchange 
abroad other than via the banking system is henceforth 
forbidden. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] We have had some talks with foreign parties 
about rescheduling agreements. Will this prove useful and 
effective in this process? 
  ['Adeli] Fundamentally, one of the reasons behind the new 
decisions was that our rescheduling negotiations, fortunately, 
proved successful. We have been able to obtain allowances for 
the payment of our debts. From 1 June of the Christian year, 
that is, in a few days from now, we will begin the first of a 
series of payments, which will amount to about 4.5 billion marks 
to German sellers. This has had a very good impact on banking 
relations with foreign countries. Some insurance 
establishments, such as Canadian insurance and Australian 
insurance and some others have announced that they will accept 
our letters of credit. This will, consequently prove to be a 
new opportunity, both for the country and for importers. God 
willing, they will be able to operate using the banking system. 
I think that these are the positive effects of what we have 
done. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you.

  [Text] Tehran, May 28 (AFP) -- Iran on Saturday banned all 
importers from buying hard currency on the open market in a bid 
to cut demand for the dollar and halt the slide of the rial. 
  The new measure, which caps a series of efforts to curb 
imports, requires all foreign purchases to be ordered instead 
through the country's state banking system, the Central Bank 
said. 
  It also requires importers to register their orders at the 
Commerce Ministry and present a certificate of exchange from the 
banks before being able to release their goods from the customs 
office, it said. 
  In the past two months, the ministry has been authorizing 
the 
release of imported goods only if the owner deposited an equal 
amount of cash at the bank. 
  These restrictions, often costly and time-consuming, had so 
far applied only to state companies, while private importers 
could still turn to the open market for their hard currency. 
  The latest measure is designed to further tighten imports, 
which have dropped from 23 billion dollars in 1992 to seven 
billion dollars last year, according to official figures. 
  The restrictions on imports have been adopted to cut private 
demand for hard currency and enable the government to repay some 
30 billion dollars in short and medium-term foreign debts. 
  The fall in imports also came as Iran's trade partners 
refused to honor Iranian letters of credit after the country 
came up with a payment arrears of some 13 billion dollars. 
  Iran has since managed to reschedule or refinance some seven 
billion dollars of its debts, but it will have to pay the trade 
partners from four to five billion dollars by the year 2000. 
  Tehran earned about 14 billion dollars in hard currency in 
1993, mainly through oil sales, according to Western economic 
experts in Tehran. 
  Another aim of the new measure is to curb the activities of 
the open currency market, which is often blamed for the rial 
losing about 50 percent of its value against foreign currencies 
since November. 
  Several certificated money-changers in the capital have 
stopped their operations, with many others expected to follow 
suit. 
  Speaking to AFP on Saturday, one money-changer said the 
government was running the risk of creating a black market by 
cracking down on authorised dealers.

  [Excerpts] Majles Speaker Nateq-Nuri has attended a 
gathering of seminarians, scholars, and teachers of Qom seminary 
at the Dar al-Shafa' school. [passage omitted] 
  Stressing the success of the fourth Majles, the speaker 
said: 
The government is dutybound, despite the reduction in the price 
of oil, to provide essential goods for the public and the 
foreign exchange required by manufacturing plants. That has 
increased high prices and inflation within society. 
  He announced that Iran's foreign debts amount to $10 
billion. 
He said: They are loans obtained from other countries which 
were spent on infra-structural projects in the country.

<F P=106> [Commentary by 'Ali Feyz: "Foreign Debts"] </F>
  [Text] Remarks concerning foreign debts are so vague and 
sometimes so contradictory that a clear picture of what the 
situation is like cannot be obtained. Figures that have neither 
been officially confirmed nor refuted show that we have a 
foreign debt of about $30 billion and that officials believe 
that this amount is not so great as to spark any concerns, 
especially when the Central Bank has been so unprecedentedly 
successful--allegedly--in being able to arrange for the 
repayment of these loans in installments. And according to 
officials, all this has been achieved despite the obstructionism 
of America in its opposition to the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  As to the interest rate on this debt and to what amount from 
the national wealth will ultimately be paid in interest is 
something nobody is ready to comment on. But judging from the 
nature of credit organizations or of Western companies, one can 
conclude that these installment payments will not be free of 
charge. 
  Nevertheless, the most interesting remarks on this came from 
Dr. Mohammad Hoseyn 'Adeli [Central Bank governor] who claimed 
that Iran's debts will be $18 billion by the year 2006. In 
order to better understand this point, we should first point out 
that it is now 1994 or, in other words, the last decade of the 
20th century and that Mr. 'Adeli is therefore talking about 12 
years from now or the first decade of the 21st century. 
  Of course there is no doubt that it is our problem that we 
do 
not understand which policies we should adopt in order to solve 
our debt problem. But, at any rate, policies are not that clear 
for the man in the street to understand. Thus, instead of 
considering the Central Bank governor's remarks that our foreign 
debts will be limited by the year 2006 as a promising sign, we 
see, on the contrary, that despite the previous promises by the 
officials who claimed that with the adoption of contraction 
policies, loans would be quickly repaid, we should not expect 
our debts to smooth out. If the Central Bank can truly limit 
the foreign debt to $18 billion as stated by Dr. 'Adeli, then 
the Iranian nation should be thankful. But what we are worried 
about is that the volume of debts will increase while our 
foreign exchange income will not reach a favorable level that 
will allow us to limit our debts, especially when it is not 
clear what interest will be added to these debts. 
  Another important point is that our foreign exchange 
policies 
are not based on comprehensive planning that covers the other 
sectors of the economy as well. And based on this, one cannot 
be very optimistic. Nevertheless, the bad experience that we 
have concerning foreign debts shows that this is an experience 
that should not be repeated. Explaining the reasons and 
answering the question on why we have foreign debts or even 
telling us that these expenditures were for infrastructure 
projects that will yield fruit in the future are not enough to 
convince the people why we should have amassed debts in the 
first place. Our culture, based on its history, considers 
borrowing--for whatever reason--a weakness, and it will not 
easily accept the fact that we have debts to repay. 
  At any rate, we will be lucky if our debts are limited to 
$18 
billion until 2006 as has been stated by Mr. 'Adeli. But what 
we should be afraid of is that we gullibly sit back and not 
realize that an important part of our national income is being 
devoured by debts. Many of the countries that have debts today 
did not realize when they received the loans that one day they 
would be unable to repay them. Moreover, is it really wise for 
us to spend our replaceable national resources which are the 
backing for our world credibility for areas the returns of which 
are doubtful? The answers to these questions should be given by 
those who compile our country's fiscal policies. But, at any 
rate, these are the questions that exist, and we should not turn 
a deaf ear to them.

  [Text] Tehran, 15 Ordibehesht [5 May] IRNA -- The Foreign 
Exchange Market Regulating Committee, chaired by Hojjat ol-Eslam 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani, president of the republic, met and made new 
decisions about controlling the foreign exchange rate and the 
fight against brokers. 
  The public relations office of the office of the president 
of 
the republic reports that at this meeting the report on the 
latest changes having to do with solving the problem of Iran's 
suspended debts and the successes achieved was given to the 
president of the republic. In view of the nation's foreign 
exchange reserves, the decision was made that to fight the 
corruption of the brokers in the foreign exchange market and to 
stabilize the foreign exchange rate, in addition to providing 
foreign exchange for goods that are obtained at the Foreign 
Exchange Bank's official rate, the banking system is also 
required to provide at a rate 50 rials [R] below the free market 
rate the foreign exchange needed by importers who have 
registered or are registering at the Ministry of Commerce to 
import in exchange for exports. 
  Likewise, the banking system will buy foreign exchange 
obtained from exports at the same rate, should the exporters so 
desire. 
  Following the decisions made at the meeting of the Foreign 
Exchange Market Regulation Committee, a statement was issued by 
the Central Bank. 
  According to this statement, all importers of goods who have 
obtained authorization to import in exchange for exports by 
registering orders at the Ministry of Commerce may go to a 
foreign exchange branch of the nation's commercial banks and 
submit their request to demand a draft or to open a confirmed 
letter of credit in the interest of the sellers. 
  When the Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
receives the requests and their statistical registration, it 
will sell foreign exchange from the nation's banking system at 
R50 less than the going rates and will issue a draft or open a 
letter of credit. The rate of the foreign exchange for opening a 
confirmed letter of credit through the nation's banking system 
will remain fixed until the time of the exchange of shipping 
documents on the goods, and there will be no risk of foreign 
exchange rate fluctuations to the importers between the date of 
the opening of the letter of credit and the date of the exchange 
of the shipping documents for the goods. 
  The above procedures are exclusively for imports in exchange 
for exports, and for other groups of goods the banks are 
required as before to allocate foreign exchange at the R1,750 
rate. 
  This statement was issued as a guideline to all banks and 
the 
banks are required to obtain the documents from applicants and 
to take the necessary steps. 
  The decision by the Foreign Exchange Market Regulation 
Committee was also presented to the Council of Ministers and it 
was decided that if any government institution or institution 
affiliated with the government goes to the free market to obtain 
foreign exchange, this will be regarded as illegal and the 
managers involved will be prosecuted. 
  Likewise, any kind of negligence or failure to perform by 
the 
banks during the process of allocating the foreign exchange will 
be regarded as cooperation with people who are undermining the 
nation's foreign exchange system. 
  Based on a decision by the Council of Ministers, all the 
managers of the foreign exchange branches of the commercial 
banks are required to expedite foreign exchange allocations, and 
government institutions and companies are forbidden from 
entering the free market for foreign exchange. 
<H5>  Nonbank Credit Institutions </H5>
  At the meeting of the Council of Ministers a report was also 
presented by the chief of the Central Bank on how to create 
nonbank credit institutions and the regulations appropriate for 
them. 
  This report announced that the goal in creating these kinds 
of institutions is to complete the organization of the nation's 
financial system to make it more competent and to provide 
resources and allocate them for investment in various sectors.

  [Text] Tehran, 17 Farvardin [16 April] -- Construction to 
complete the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant has begun after years 
of suspension, with the cooperation of Russian experts. 
  An informed official at the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant gave 
an interview to the newspaper JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI in which he 
announced the above. He said: Following the preliminary 
agreements made with the Russians in the last few months, 
construction to complete the first unit of the Bushehr Nuclear 
Power Plant with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts of electrical 
power began early this year with a four-year schedule. Russian 
experts and specialists are now working on this power plant. 
  He added: So far 30,000 tons of essential parts for the 
power 
plant have been shipped into the country from Germany and are 
being properly stored in warehouses. At the same time, 
unfortunately about 7,000 tons of the power plant's essential 
parts, whose price has been paid and legally belong to the 
Islamic Republic of Iran, have been impounded in German ports. 
  Continuing, this informed official noted: Fortunately, 90 
percent of the damage to the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant caused 
by the imposed war will be repaired by the capable hands of 
skilled domestic specialist manpower, and the rest will be 
repaired in the course of the plant's operation. 
  It is necessary to explain that the 5.8-billion-mark [DM] 
contract to build the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant was signed on 
10 Tir 1355 [1 July 1976] between the Iran Atomic Energy 
Organization and the West German Kraft Werk Union Company. Based 
on this contract, the aforementioned company was required to 
build a nuclear electrical power plant consisting of two 
pressurized light water units, each with a thermal capacity of 
3,715 thermic megawatts [MW] and an electrical capacity of 1,296 
MW on an 18-km site in the southwestern part of the province of 
Bushehr. Of this amount, so far DM5.8 billion has been paid by 
Iran. 
  In addition to this, separate contracts have also been 
signed 
to procure the needed fuel and 200,000 cubic meters of drinking 
water for this complex, for which more than DM137 million and 
DM394,000 and $43 million, respectively, has been paid to 
Germany by the Iran Atomic Energy Organization. 
  Based on the same report, to implement these contracts so 
far 
about 85 percent of the construction on the Bushehr Nuclear 
Power Plant has been completed, and about 65 percent of its 
mechanical, electrical, and other installations have been 
installed. 
  On the other hand, in KEYHAN-E HAVA'I's contact with the 
office of Engineer Mohsen Mehr 'Alizadeh, general manager of 
power plants for the Iran Atomic Energy Organization, it was 
announced that the full details of Iran's contract with the 
Russians to complete the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant will soon 
be announced.

<F P=106> ["Signals" column by Yunus Hasan al-Samarra'i: "It Is a New </F>
War of the Francs"] 
  [Text] It is a world tyrant. It threw heavenly values 
overboard all over the world and then it trampled upon human 
rights while falsely bragging about them. It has confirmed its 
continued opposition to human rights in Iraq by its stupid 
insistence on continuing the unfair and unjust blockade. 
  This despot behaves like one who refuses to look into the 
mirror to avoid seeing his ugly face. The devils are in 
Washington and London. They do not even bother to read about 
what Iraq has done to fulfill the UN Security Council 
resolutions, despite their unfairness. 
  They are targeting true Islam as expressed by Iraq. They 
want to finally liquidate Arabism and pan-Arab hopes in a new 
war of the Franks, albeit in a tattered garb. 
  Whoever reads history will understand the substance of the 
policy being pursued by the leaders of the capitalist Western 
powers. This is their custom toward the Arab world and Muslims. 
The Arab world knew them in the war of the Francs, which the 
West called the Crusades, and the invasion of the Arab Levant by 
the Knights of St John of Jerusalem following the liquidation of 
the Islamic state in Andalusia. Our people knew them in 
contemporary history after the Balfour Declaration and the 
Sykes-Picot Agreement that divided the Arab homeland among 
France, Britain, and Italy, and through the U.S. empire, 
represented by U.S. domination of several Arab officials and the 
confiscation of their independent decisionmaking, as well as its 
complete domination of UN Security Council resolutions. 
  The United States must understand that no matter how much 
they suffer from hunger and the unfairness of U.S.-British 
policy, the Iraqis will be with the leader struggler Saddam 
Husayn, backing his decision, supporting his stand, upholding 
his opinion, and fighting at his behest. This is a fact that 
Western leaders must understand. It has been expressed by the 
poet who said: Even if they drown it in blood, Iraq will remain 
sincere to its Arabism. 
  Damn U.S.-British policy and its hostile stands against the 
Iraqi people! God is great and victory will always be for the 
leader of Iraq and his great people.

  [Text] Baghdad, 30 May (INA)--National Assembly Speaker 
Sa'di Mahdi Salih has called for healing the rift among the Arab 
nation's ranks through a positive and unified Arab position 
based on cooperation and developing the mutual fraternal 
interests of all sides. 
  During a National Assembly session here today, he expressed 
Iraq's readiness to develop this position to put the Arab house 
in order in the interest of the Arab and Islamic nations. 
  The National Assembly speaker reviewed the situation in the 
Arab and international arenas, as well as developments in light 
of the U.S. statements on the continuation of the embargo and 
the postponement of lifting it in violation of the desire of the 
international community, particularly the UN Security Council 
itself. 
  He said that the increasing world calls for lifting the 
embargo indicate all countries' desire to restore relations with 
Iraq to their previous level and to establish economic and trade 
relations in a way that will achieve their interests in this 
important region of the world. 
  Sa'di Mahdi Salih praised the international efforts to this 
effect, and said that the calls by France, Russia, China, 
Brazil, Spain, Pakistan, Nigeria, and other states constitute a 
positive stand toward the Iraqi people. He expressed the hope 
that these efforts will bear fruit in the interest of our people 
and nation.

<F P=106> [Column by Nasrallah al-Dawudi: "Ill-fate"] </F>
  [Text] The current fighting between the agents in our 
beloved Iraqi Kurdistan has revealed several facts. 
  First, it has revealed the enemies' real intentions behind 
the creation of the so-called "security zone." The pages of 
their scenario are being blown away one after the other. Having 
plundered the gains made for the autonomy, which was engineered 
by the symbol of national unity President Saddam Husayn; turned 
the region into a den for Zionist espionage, and spread chaos 
and ruination in that Iraqi paradise, the enemies have now moved 
to the final page in that illusory scenario; namely, the 
liquidation of Kurds by manipulating agents and turning them 
against one another in fierce fighting in which thousands of our 
innocent people are falling victims in accordance with a set 
plan which is being implemented by these agents with the 
recklessness of traitors, the lack of conscience of agents, and 
the treason of criminals. 
  Second, the agents who are befriending each other today are 
past enemies, and they will continue to be enemies despite their 
common interests and evil designs against our dear Iraqi 
Kurdistan. The Kurdistan Democratic Party cannot strike an 
alliance with the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. Their age-old 
conflict cannot possibly be removed by a theatrical signing of a 
treasonous agreement against the homeland and the people. The 
conflict between the two sides has continued for decades. So, 
it cannot simply be resolved on the table of negotiations even 
if it is a table of treason and charlatanry on which these 
agents have been brought up. Here are the facts being revealed 
and here are the cities, streets, districts, and subdistricts of 
Kurdistan streaming with blood caused by the fighting between 
these agents over the illusory booty of treason and 
mercenariness. Here is Jalal Talabani acquiring an additional 
characteristic of "fear." He says he cannot enter the region 
unless he is received by Mas'ud Barzani in Faysh Khabur and is 
personally accompanied into the region as an expression of this 
shaky reconciliation deal. Being birds of a feather, the 
intentions have become known and have therefore been rejected.

  [Text] Military Industrialization Organization [MIO] teams 
in "17 April Factory" have succeeded in producing industrial 
equipment to help beat the unjust blockade on our people. 
  The teams produced two electric boilers with capacities of 
100 and 80 liters. The boilers are useful in the production of 
silica glue, which requires heating for higher concentration. 
Silica glue is used in basic materials that go into the 
production of ceramic moulds and also in textile and paper 
industries. 
  The teams have also produced a mill for grinding (malachite) 
which is used in production of ceramic moulds, refractory 
cement, furnaces, and heat-resistant moulds. The designed 
production capacity of the mill is 480 kg during a 24-hour 
operational period. 
  MIO teams in "17 April Factory" have succeeded for the first 
time in producing induction coil for melting and casting 
furnaces. This equipment, which is essential in induction 
furnaces to transform electric power into thermal power, is used 
in melting such metals as brass and aluminum. The induction 
coil used to be imported with hard currencies from abroad.

several local alternative products by relying on their resources 
and capabilities in defiance of the unfair blockade on Iraq. 
  The director general of the General Oil Refining 
Establishment in the central region explained that engineering 
teams in the Research and Development and Light Crude Sections 
of the refinery have produced two local solvents to help bolster 
the national industry. These solvents, he said, go into the

  [Text] Nineveh -- A wheat and barley harvest campaign to 
defeat the unfair food embargo on Iraq and to ensure food for 
the people has begun in Ninawa Governorate with the 
participation of 1,900 harvesters and hundreds of trucks to 
transport grain from harvest areas to more than 44 marketing 
centers scattered all over the governorate. 
  AL-THAWRAH mission, which visited harvest and marketing 
areas 
in the company of Governor Staff Lt. Gen. 'Abd-al-Wahid Shannan 
Al Ribat, who is also chairman of the governorate's Higher 
Harvest and Marketing Committee, saw large numbers of peasants 
and farmers marketing their crops and benefiting from the many 
incentives offered by the government under the direction and 
support of leader President Saddam Husayn both with regard to 
the new higher purchase prices and the guaranteeing of all 
requirements for cultivation, harvesting, and marketing. 
  The governor told AL-THAWRAH: With God's blessing, and in 
the name of the struggler leader Saddam Husayn Ninawa, the bread 
basket of the great Iraqi people began on 10 March its jihadist 
campaign to provide food for the Iraqis and to abort the unjust 
blockade against our steadfast people. The noble, righteous 
Iraqis concerted all their efforts in order to implement the 
campaign and to bring it to a successful conclusion on time. 
Thousands of participants in this campaign proceeded to the 
harvest and marketing areas. 
  The governor affirmed that in fulfillment of the interest, 
follow up, and patronage of our leader struggler, Saddam Husayn, 
and in order to bring this campaign to a successful conclusion 
in our dear governorate, which is considered the biggest 
cultivator, harvester, and marketer of grain in our country, the 
government has exerted enormous efforts and offered great help 
toward the harvest and marketing campaign.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-Bari al-Hariri] </F>
  [Text] A special symposium on the Arab bread loaf, 
organized by the Arab Federation for Food Industries in 
coordination with the Ministries of Trade and Agriculture, has 
called upon all Arab states to exert their efforts to lift the 
unjust blockade on the Iraqi people. 
  The symposium also called for exploiting all means in order 
to increase the production of wheat and grains and to build 
strategic storage for these crops. It also called for the 
formation of joint working teams to help coordinate Arab 
positions on the purchase of wheat and grain, and for the 
establishment of an authoritative Arab center for scientific 
research and technological development concerned with making 
bread and setting unified Arab specifications for a standard 
Arab loaf. 
  Dr. Falah Sa'id Jabr, secretary general of the Arab 
Federation of Food Industries, told AL-THAWRAH that the 
symposium proposed the establishment of an operations room to 
follow world wheat and grain prices in light of the new world 
changes that are expected to follow the application of the 
integrated "quality" and new "GATT": agreements. 
  Dr. Jabr pointed out that the symposium also proposed 
revising the existing law on grain publicity, improving the 
competence of those in charge of laboratory tests, and setting 
up new standards for evaluating the performance of governorates 
in grain production. 
  The symposium called on the peasants productive cooperative 
movement, investors, and farmers to build silos according to 
proper engineering designs in order to store produced grain 
close to the production areas, where it will be at the disposal 
of the Ministry of Trade. 
  The symposium's recommendations also proposed improving 
current milling methods, examining methods of refining flour in 
all mills, limiting use of very fine sieves in the first sieving 
and grinding stages, deploying mobile maintenance workshops to 
serve mills and bakeries in all parts of Iraq, paying greater 
attention to the question of producing home-made bread, 
encouraging the use of home gas ovens, and reducing waste as a 
result of sieving flour at home.

<F P=106> [Report by Salwa al-Ustuwani: "Damascus: We Will Not Be </F>
Dragged Along Like the PLO"] 
  [Text] Damascus -- Syria said yesterday that it would not 
be dragged along to what the PLO was dragged to and that it 
would resist all Israeli expansionist plans and economic 
hegemony projects. A Syrian official has told AL-SHARQ 
AL-AWSAT: We are explaining to everyone that peace depends 
above all on full and comprehensive withdrawal and that Israel's 
phased security agreements are nothing more than misleading 
ploys and ways of circumventing the Security Council resolutions. 
  The official added: Israel has dithered and procrastinated 
with all the Arab parties and requested peace treaties, 
normalization of relations, and opening of borders under the 
pretext of building up trust but refused to withdraw from the 
occupied territories or to commit itself to such withdrawal. 
  The Syrian official said that what Israel wanted was not a 
genuine Palestinian autonomy or authority but a group that obeys 
its orders, carries out its instructions, and participates in 
repressing the Palestinian people in the same way that the 
mercenaries of Antoine Lahd (South Lebanese Army) act against 
the Lebanese people and their towns and villages. 
  Referring to the Lebanese front, the Syrian official said 
that Israel threatened to use force if the Lebanese Army tried 
advance to the front lines, foiled every initiative by the 
Lebanese Government for the implementation of Security Council 
resolution 425, continuously committed aggression against the 
south, carried out terrorist operations deep into Lebanese 
territory, and abducted Lebanese citizens from their homes as it 
did with Shaykh Mustafa al-Dirani on the pretext that he 
belonged to the Lebanese resistance. He added that Syria would 
not have been safe from Israeli aggressions had it been weak and 
vulnerable. 
  In conclusion, the Syrian official said: Israel wants feeble 
agreements that cannot survive and last but Syria does not 
accept that kind of logic.

  [Text] In its editorial today, the newspaper TISHRIN 
asserts that Syria has participated in the peace process in 
response to a U.S. initiative stemming from specific bases and 
in exchange for a series of U.S. assurances on the 
implementation of the Security Council resolutions, the 
land-for-peace principle, and the achievement of a just and 
comprehensive settlement on all fronts of the conflict. 
  TISHRIN notes that, from the very beginning, Syria insisted 
that the bases of the Madrid conference should be clear and 
unequivocal because it knows well that Israel rejects peace. 
Syria also knows about Israel's procrastination, falsification 
of facts, attempts to deceive world public opinion, and 
expression of intentions that are the opposite of its real 
intentions. Yet, even these former intentions were never shown 
throughout more than two and a half years of the Washington 
talks. 
  The paper adds: The United States made efforts and 
frequently sent its secretary of state to the region. However, 
the Israeli intransigence remained unchanged, and the Rabin 
government refused to withdraw from the Golan and other occupied 
territories, thus rejecting the implementation of the Security 
Council resolutions in this regard. 
  TISHRIN demands that the United States, which committed 
itself to playing the role of a full and fair partner, force 
Israel to commit itself to implementing the Security Council's 
resolutions, so that the entire Golan will return to Syria and 
the other occupied territories will return to their Arab owners. 
This is because it is in the interest of the United States and 
the international community that international law, the 
principles of justice, and the UN charters prevail and that 
national and human rights be respected everywhere. 
  The paper asserts that Syria continues to reject calls for 
secret talks, and that the Washington talks, which have 
continued since the Madrid conference, are the most ideal 
framework. Syria continues to declare its positions publicly, 
and the Syrian policy has only one face and one consistent 
position. 
  Concluding, TISHRIN says: Syria can never be dragged into 
partial settlements. It does not bargain over the territories 
of Arab brethren, and will not sell out an iota of the pan-Arab 
soil.

  [Text] Under the headline "Attempts To Buy Time and 
Prospects for Peace Process," AL-BA'TH writes: With the peace 
process deadlocked and continually coming up against Israeli 
intransigence, it is legitimate to ask about the lengths to 
which Yitzhaq Rabin will go in his procrastinating and 
temporizing tactics. 
  As the personal envoy of the Russian president continues his 
talks in the region about the peace process, there is talk that 
the American secretary of state will make a new Middle East tour 
by mid- June to break the logjam in the peace process and 
possibly to work out a date to restart the bilateral talks. 
  Israel's posture on the peace process is as negative and 
rejectionist as ever, and it continues to pursue separate and 
incomplete deals, thus locking Washington's and Moscow's efforts 
into a vicious circle. 
  Syria has made it clear over and over that it is committed 
to 
the principles and bases of the peace process as laid out by UN 
resolutions. Israel's recognition of its failure to promote a 
separate settlement with Lebanon, Syria, or Jordan is evidence 
that the peace process needs to proceed along the principles and 
bases on which it was launched. 
  It is vital that the way to deal with the equivocating and 
temporizing Rabin government be rethought. This is because 
neither the peace process nor the general state of affairs in 
the Middle East is advanced by Israel's tactics of buying time, 
AL-BA'TH concludes.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] In its editorial under the headline "The 
Responsibility for the Stalemate in the Peace Process," the 
newspaper AL-BA'TH says: During his recent tour, U.S. Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher must have noticed the difference 
between Syria's way of dealing with the peace process and that 
of Israel. Syria has accepted the bases of the peace process 
and was concerned about dealing with this process in both words 
and deeds. It has sincerely and faithfully cooperated with the 
U.S. Administration to make this process succeed. However, 
Israel's intransigence and the Rabin government's insistence on 
refusing to announce its acceptance of the bases of the peace 
process, particularly the full withdrawal from the occupied Arab 
territories and the restoration of Golan in full, have brought 
the talks to a halt and obstructed efforts to reactivate them or 
push them forward. 
  In addition to this, the paper says it believes that the 
ones 
who have caused this stalemate in the peace process are the 
Israeli rulers because they seek to exploit the peace process in 
the interest of their schemes of bestowing legitimacy on the 
occupation, just as what has taken place in the implementation 
of the secret Oslo agreement, and to bring the peace process to 
a halt. 
  The paper stresses that Syria has been committed and will 
continue to be committed to the peace process. However, it 
rejects diktats, conditions, and blackmail. 
  The paper says: No one should expect Syria to relinquish any 
Arab rights or land, or to accept secret talks, because Syria, 
as President Hafiz al-Asad has said, has fought with honor and 
is negotiating with honor, and consequently, it will not do 
anything it is ashamed of when it holds negotiations for the 
sake of restoring its national soil and of achieving a just and 
comprehensive peace. 
  Concluding its editorial, AL-BA'TH says: Syria will continue 
to cooperate with any efforts to push the peace process forward 
in accordance with the bases agreed upon in the peace initiative 
and the resolutions of the international legitimacy. 
  Under the headline "The Real Progress," the newspaper 
AL-THAWRAH says: We cannot talk about pushing the peace process 
forward before Israel announces its commitment to the bases of 
the peace process and its readiness to fully withdraw from the 
Golan, southern Lebanon, and all the occupied Arab territories. 
Undoubtedly, the United States is exerting immense efforts to 
break what it calls the stalemate in the peace process. 
However, breaking the real stalemate cannot take place without 
having Israel give clear answers to the substantive questions 
posed by the essence of the peace process, represented by full 
withdrawal. 
  The paper notes: The Israeli rulers lack courage and do not 
abide by the international resolutions. The Israeli rulers have 
continued to ignore the requirements of a true peace in order to 
evade full withdrawal and to peddle partial and incomplete 
settlements that do not meet the conditions of a just and 
comprehensive peace. Neither do they respond to the 
requirements of implementing the international resolutions. 
These settlements encourage the Arabs to sign the writs of 
their capitulation similar to the Gaza-Jericho agreement, which 
placed the Palestinian people under Israeli military siege and 
put Palestinian economic and political decision under the 
Israeli trusteeship. Thus, the region has continued to be a 
hotbed of tension and turmoil. 
  AL-THAWRAH says: Syria will continue to resist Israel's 
attempts even as it responds to every sincere effort to achieve 
a just and comprehensive peace. 
  Concluding, the paper says: If Israel does not abide by the 
bases of the peace process and the resolutions of international 
legitimacy, efforts will continue to be lost in a waste land. 
  Under the headline "Rabin Stresses Israel's Rejection of 
Peace," the newspaper TISHRIN says: Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin's statement that he is not ready to withdraw from 
all Golan, or even to make a promise to withdraw, constitutes 
decisive proof of Israel's rejection of peace and its efforts to 
sabotage the U.S. initiative that was based on the 
land-for-peace formula, the implementation of the relevant 
resolutions of international legitimacy, and the achievement of 
a just and comprehensive settlement on all fronts of the 
conflict. 
  TISHRIN adds: Rabin's rejection proves anew Israel's 
expansionist ambitions and aggressive schemes. 
  The paper notes that the UN Security Council resolutions 
speak about a comprehensive peace, and not about a partial 
withdrawal. The U.S. initiative does not include peace for part 
of the land, but peace-for-land. 
  The paper says: Israel understands peace its own way, not in 
accordance with the international rules. In other words, peace 
to Israel is expansion, occupation, devouring the occupied 
territories, and blackmailing the international community. 
Therefore, Rabin's stand does not surprise Syria. 
  The paper emphasizes that Syria will not relinquish its land 
or that of the Arabs. Neither will it compromise on its rights 
and sovereignty or be dragged into suspect agreements. Syria 
has openly called for achieving the peace of the brave, the 
peace of right and justice which eliminates occupation and 
aggression. 
  Concluding its article, TISHRIN holds Israel responsible for 
sabotaging the entire peace process and for bringing the region 
back to tension and turmoil.

<F P=106> ["Spotlights" column by Salma Kamil: "How Do We Ensure </F>
Stability of Prices?"] 
  [Text] The minister of supply and internal trade has issued 
instructions to the Governorates of Damascus and the Damascus 
Rural Area to report and stamp out offenses whatever they may be 
and to intensify price control patrols in the markets in order 
to prevent retailers from swallowing up the new civil servants 
wage increase. The minister asked the chambers of commerce in 
Damascus and the Damascus Rural Area to hold a joint meeting to 
achieve this objective by enlightening retailers. 
  We believe that intensification of price control patrols 
alone will not be sufficient to cover the capital and the rural 
area, in view of their vast expanse and the huge number of 
retailers, As for enlightening retailers about the need to 
stick to official prices, this is something which can never be 
materialized. Prices increase or decrease according to the 
market forces of supply and demand, which apply to all 
commodities. The retailer will not stick to an official price 
list, even if there is one. 
  So what can the consumer do in the face of such a situation? 
Whoever follows the market movements will observe that there has 
already been a clear increase in prices since the wage increase. 
We know, for instance, that the Ministry of Supply has so far 
not announced any changes in the prices of commodities or 
services, other than domestic transportation fares between 
provinces. Still, the prices of many commodities have gone up 
and the citizen is being compelled to pay the price charged by 
the retailer. 
  The stability of market prices demands government 
intervention through its commercial network and public sector 
companies in order to provide a suitable package of commodities 
for the citizens at prices which can complete with market retail 
prices. We believe that the government has companies which 
produce all kinds of commodities. It also has a sufficient 
number of sales outlets and consumer cooperatives which can 
ensure the stability of market prices. When the private sector 
discovers that the commodities it is selling are offered by 
consumer cooperatives at cheaper prices, it will be compelled to 
charge a price closer to that of the cooperatives. Therefore, 
the solution does not just lie in suppressing retailers who sell 
at higher prices by intensifying price control patrols, which 
will not be able to control everyone no matter how hard they 
try, but also in the intervention by the government and the 
numerous productive public sector companies by providing a 
package of commodities acceptable in quality and price. This is 
the most effective way to achieve price stability in the short 
and long term. This way, we will be able to achieve two 
objectives at the same time: Introducing the production of 
public sector companies on the one hand, and ensuring 
commodities for citizens on the other.

  [Text] The 11th ministerial conference of the non-aligned 
countries resumed its meetings today with the heads of 
delegations at the conference hall in Madinat al-Nasr in Cairo 
under the chairmanship of Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa. 
  The General Ministerial Committee resumed its discussion of 
the items on the agenda: disarmament, international security, 
the double standards from which developing states are suffering 
at the international level, and the possibility of expanding 
membership of the UN Security Council to include a larger number 
of Third World states. 
  The political and economic committees began their meetings. 
The Economic Committee will discuss the impact of GATT on 
developing countries' economies and the problem of African debt. 
  Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa stated that at its morning 
session, the conference discussed a report by the Non-Aligned 
Movement's chairman on the political and economic problems 
facing the movement. He added that the afternoon session will 
discuss the UN role, its reorganization, and the international 
economic situation, with emphasis on GATT and its impact on 
Third World economies. He added that the conference will also 
discuss the social development of the non-aligned states as well 
as the venue for the next non-aligned summit. He said that a 
Latin American state will probably host that summit. Musa 
revealed that the conference will also discuss the setting up of 
a mechanism to handle disputes among the movement members. 
  Asked about differences emerging during the present meeting, 
Musa said that there are no disputes other than that between 
Iraq and Kuwait. He said that he met with the Saudi, Syrian, 
and other Arab foreign ministers today and discussed 
developments in Yemen, since events there affect the entire 
region. He added that the continuation of military operations 
is of concern to all Arabs. 
  Musa said that Egypt will certainly approve the resolution 
that the UN Security Council will issue. He explained that this 
resolution will call for an end to the fighting and for 
dispatching a fact-finding committee to Yemen. He noted that 
Egypt was among the cosponsors of that draft resolution.

  [Text] Asyut, Egypt, June 1 (AFP)--A suspected Muslim 
militant shot and seriously wounded a policeman in southern 
Egypt late Wednesday, a source close to the security services 
said. 
  Salim Muhammad, a railway policeman, was in charge of 
security on the Cairo to Aswan train when he was shot as it left 
the station in Abu Mawas, in the al-Minya Province in Upper 
Egypt, 270 kilometres (167 miles) south of Cairo. 
  Security services launched a manhunt, after his attacker 
fled 
the scene, the source added. 
  Asyut is a stronghold for militants who have waged a 
two-year 
campaign to topple the secular government of President Husni 
Mubarak, which has left more than 400 dead, including policemen. 
  But until recently al-Minya had not witnessed many clashes 
between security forces and militants.

  [Excerpt] Aden, Yemen, June 2 (AFP) -- A missile fired by 
northern Yemeni forces slammed into this southern stronghold on 
Thursday [2 June] wounding 21 people and artillery duels raged 
only hours after the UN Security Council called for a ceasefire. 
  One of two surface-to-surface missiles was intercepted by 
south Yemeni anti-aircraft fire but the other exploded near a 
mosque in the northern suburb of al-Shaykh 'Uthman, officials 
said. 
  Sixteen worshipers were hurt inside the mosque when the 
missile struck during dawn prayers. The raid left pools of 
blood on the carpets and the courtyard, witnesses said. Five 
people were injured in nearby dwellings. 
  Hundreds later gathered in the area to denounce "the killer 
regime" of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, a northerner. 
  The missile attack came just hours after the United Nations 
Security Council had adopted a resolution calling for a 
ceasefire in the civil war in Yemen, which erupted May 5. 
  Heavy artillery duels on the war front just north of Aden 
were so intense Thursday morning that buildings in the city 
shook heavily. 
  Southern warplanes were constantly taking off and landing at 
Aden Airport as they flew sorties against the northern forces of 
Salih, who has strongly opposed any UN "interference" in the 
conflict. 
  The presidential council of the breakaway southern state led 
by 'Ali Salim al-Bid announced it would "unconditionally 
respect" the Security Council resolution and assist a fact 
finding mission being dispatched by the world body. 
  There was no immediate reaction from Sanaa, where the 
government held a meeting to discuss the resolution. [passage

  [Text] President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari has said, as a 
result of sound economic policies adopted by the present 
government, the climate for foreign investment in Pakistan has 
become lucrative. The president was addressing Pakistanis in New 
York. The president said the response of foreign investors to 
the government's incentive package has been very positive. As a 
result of macroeconomic management, foreign investment in 
several sectors -- particularly in the sector of power 
generation -- will increase in the days to come. 
  He said Pakistan's nuclear program is not weapon-oriented. 
We have taken a conscious decision not to use our nuclear 
capability for weapon production unless our security is 
threatened. The president said Pakistan has told the United 
States that no unilateral solution could be imposed on Pakistan. 
Any solution to the nonproliferation problem in South Asian 
region has to be evolved in the regional context. He said 
Pakistan had proposed in 1974 that the South Asian region be 
declared a nuclear-free zone. Since then, Pakistan has made six 
more concrete proposals to achieve nonproliferation in the 
region, but India has rejected all of them. Under the 
circumstances, the United States or the world at large could not 
expect realistically that Pakistan would accept any unilateral 
obligation.

speaker of the House of Representatives, has said that the house 
and the Jordanian people whom we represent are vigorously 
opposed to the fighting taking place between the brothers in 
Yemen. Jordan, al-Masri said, stands for the unity of the 
Yemeni people and their country. 
  In a letter replying to one from Mr. Anis Hasan Yahya, a 
member of the Yemeni House of Representatives, al-Masri noted 
that, toward that end, Jordan's political leadership has done 
all it could. Jordan, al-Masri's letter went on, will pursue 
urgent efforts and consultations with our country's political 
leadership, as well as with brother Arabs, and explore avenues 
to bring the fighting to an end. Jordan's moves will be based 
on its conviction in the cause of the unity of the Yemeni people 
and territory, the letter said. 
  The house speaker had received a message from Mr. Yahya 
seeking the Jordanian House of Representatives' good offices to 
bring the hostilities to a halt and end the dispute in brotherly 
Yemen. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Jamal Khashuqji: "Algeria: Salvation Front </F>
Accuses Islamic Group of Trying To Impose Its Influence Over It 
by Force"] 
  [Excerpts] London -- Political sources in Algeria noted 
yesterday the continuation of the confusion over the statement 
issued by the Armed Islamic Group [AIG], in which it said that 
the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] and the Islamic State Movement 
[ISM] had been unified under its leadership. They said that no 
official denial has been distributed by the groups operating 
under the FIS' banner -- which increases confusion among the 
ranks of Islamic oppositionists. 
  However, sources close to the FIS have stressed to AL-HAYAH 
that the relationship with the AIG is strained and presages 
clashes between the two sides. The sources complained about 
what they termed "the lack of discipline among the group's 
elements and their promotion of repudiationist and extremist 
views threatening the unity of the mujahidin and the Algerian 
people." They pointed out that the straw that "broke the 
camel's back" was the AIG elements' attempt to impose their 
influence by force over FIS elements. The FIS accuses the AIG 
of being "infiltrated" by Algerian security organs, and of being 
run from outside the country by foreign quarters promoting "an 
extremist ideology combining al-salafiyah [Islamic reform 
movement], political jihad, and repudiation of society," 
according to an Algeria leading figure. 
  The leading figure pointed out that most of the AIG's cadres 
"came from Afghanistan and did not participate with the FIS in 
its political action before the January 1992 coup," which was 
followed by the cancellation of the elections following which 
the FIS nearly assumed power. 
  He stressed "the existence of a scheme being implemented by 
Algerian security organs using AIG elements with or without the 
AIG's knowledge, with a view to introducing the AIG as an 
alternative to the FIS, which peacefully persuaded the Algerian 
people to espouse the Islamic plan and presented to them a 
political, socialist, and economic program." He added that 
security organs know that "the Algerian people will abandon the 
Islamic plan if it is promoted by a group of uneducated people 
promoting repudiationist ideas and who are fighting just for the 
sake of fighting and who believe that an Islamic state can only 
be set up by force." 
  He added: "The ruling clique tried to cancel the FIS' 
existence when it issued an administrative decision to disband 
it. But it has continued to derive its legitimacy from the 
people, who have given it their confidence. And they are now 
trying to cancel it by replacing it with a deviationist group." 
[passage omitted] 
  The leading figures said the FIS is making contacts with 
Islamic leaderships abroad to urge them to suspend the support 
the AIG receives from some quarters. However he was pessimistic 
about that. He said: "Most of these quarters are mysterious, 
and the world Islamic movement itself is suffering at their 
hands. They are new on the scene and do not respect senior 
ulema, so it is difficult to deal with them." He pointed out 
that an AIG thinker named Mus'ab al-Suri, who worked in 
Afghanistan in the past and now lives in Spain, records tapes 
attacking the FIS and its programs for political change and 
accusing Cheikhs Abbasi Madani and Ali Behadj of deception 
because they accepted the principle of democracy and of turning 
to the people. 
  He cited an incident he described as "serious" which took 
place in Tiaret province in southern central Algeria, as a group 
from the AIG attacked a camp belonging to the Islamic Front and 
held a number of its covert action activists. [passage omitted]

Well-informed sources in Tehran emphasized yesterday that Syria 
has informed Iran of its intention to enter into "fundamental 
negotiations that could lead to a peaceful settlement with 
Israel." 
  Hojjat ol-Eslam 'Ali Nateq-Nuri, who was reelected yesterday 
as speaker of the Iranian Majles, said that his country has been 
informed of Syria's plans in this connection, "and we know the 
motive behind its choice of this course." Nuri pointed out that 
signing a peace treaty with Israel would be a "grave mistake" by 
Syria and could "harm its reputation." However, he stressed 
that that "would not lead to the severance of diplomatic 
relations between Tehran and Damascus." 
  Analysts describe Nateq-Nuri's remarks about the Syrian 
position as the beginning of a marked transformation in Iranian 
policy. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Baghdad, 1 Jun (INA) -- Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 
'Aziz has stated that the recent UN Security Council 
deliberations have paved the way for either lifting or easing 
the embargo on Iraq. 
  At a news conference here today, Tariq 'Aziz said: I cannot 
describe this meeting as a victory or that it achieved great 
gains because the gain we and our people expect consists of 
tangible steps to lift the embargo. 
  'Aziz emphasized that Iraq's political and diplomatic moves 
have started to produce results by having the UN Security 
Council change its stand despite the extensive hostile 
diplomatic and nondiplomatic campaign in which the Saudi and 
Kuwaiti rulers resorted to funds and bribes and the United 
States to pressures and attempts to influence people. 
  The deputy prime minister said that the Americans were 
forced 
to to come out in the open on this issue after Christopher met 
with ministers from the Gulf Cooperation Council countries and 
warned them against warming to Iraq and published an article 
stating that the embargo on Iraq should not be lifted. 
  'Aziz added: We met with all the UN Security Council members 
with the exception of the U.S. side. We met some of them more 
than once and some of the meetings were joint meetings. I also 
met with other Council members and with ambassadors of nonmember 
countries. An indepth discussion was held about all the stands. 
As to what they expect the Council will do, they told us that 
the U.S. side stubbornly refuses to admit that progress has been 
achieved concerning the implementation of the UN Security 
Council resolutions. 
  Tariq 'Aziz said: If we count the number of UN Security 
Council members that call for changing the formula of the 
[periodic] statement, recognize that there is progress in the 
implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions, and which 
believe that the question of economic embargo imposed on Iraq 
should be tackled by the Council, we find that this number 
represents the majority within the Council. 
  'Aziz said that they have been more understanding and more 
responsive than any time before to what Iraq has to say on the 
various issues, whether the issue of weapons and the 
implementation of Section C of Resolution 687, or the other 
issues that are raised against Iraq. He said that the main 
reason for this change between 1992 and until now is due to 
Iraq's steadfastness. He said Iraq's stand now finds better 
understanding than before. 
  'Aziz explained that the other positive aspects consist of 
the visits to Iraq by major business enterpreneurs from 
countries which have a say in this issue. 
  Tariq 'Aziz said another meeting will be held in July. This 
is a very important meeting and may be decisive. Perhaps, the 
deliberations and the discussions within the Council will last 
one month and perhaps Ekeus will raise a topic that has not been 
raised until now. But, this does not mean that the process of 
lifting the embargo has stopped or will stop. On the contrary, 
this process is advancing with firm steps and will produce its 
results, God willing. 
  'Aziz said that the world is moving in a direction that is 
opposite to that set by George Bush, which he called the new 
world order. It is now a world order that is different and where 
there is some kind of balance. That's why we see that they are 
paying attention to Iraq's stand. They are now listening to us. 
Those who listen to us and receive us in their capitals dispatch 
companies to discuss contracts and projects. Therefore, they 
know that the embargo on Iraq will be lifted.

Lebanon is part of Israel's policy of organized state terrorism 
against Lebanon's sovereignty. 
  In an exclusive statement to Radio Monte Carlo, Dr. Salman 
said the timing of these attacks is part of Israel's continued 
attempts to undermine the peace process and obstruct U.S. 
efforts to end the stalemate in the peace talks, which were 
launched in accordance with the Madrid frame of reference. He 
noted that the cause of the stalemate is Israel's hard-line 
approach that rejects full withdrawal from the occupied Arab 
territories in return for full peace.

  [Text] Cairo, 2 Jun (INA) -- [Iraqi] Foreign Minister 
Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf met here today with Lal Bhatia, the 
Indian minister of state for external affairs. 
  The foreign minister briefed his Indian counterpart on the 
positive stands that prevailed at the recent UN Security Council 
discussions concerning the lifting of the embargo clamped on 
Iraq, and on the majority that called for taking measures to 
lift the embargo as long as Iraq has implemented Resolution 687. 
  The talks dealt with relations between Iraq and India, means 
of promoting them, and coordination between them. The two 
ministers stressed the importance of reactivating the Nonaligned 
Movement's role in international relations, of maintaining the 
spirit and essence of the movement's principles, and of 
reinforcing economic relations among its member states. 
  Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf also met with 
Cypriot Foreign Minister Alexandros Mikhailidhis. 
  The foreign minister explained the positive stands at the 
recent UN Security Council discussions, which have clearly shown 
that Iraq has implemented all the UN Security Council 
resolutions, and that what remains is a resolution to lift the 
embargo imposed on Iraq without delay. 
  An INA correspondent in Cairo reported that the foreign 
minister explained to the Indian and Cypriot ministers that the 
Iraqi people, under the leadership of President Saddam Husayn, 
are determined to foil the embargo and the chapters of 
aggression. He also briefed them on the Iraqi people's efforts 
to reconstruct what was destroyed by the aggressors. 
  Dr. Nabil Najm, Iraq's permanent representative to the Arab 
League, attended the two meetings.

  [Text] Cairo, 2 Jun (INA) -- [Iraqi] Foreign Minister 
Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf, head of the Iraqi delegation to the 
nonaligned conference in Cairo, met in Cairo today with 
Pakistani Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali. 
  During the meeting, Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf briefed his 
Pakistani counterpart on the developments in the relationship 
between Iraq and the UN Special Commission following the recent 
review of the Security Council on lifting the blockade on Iraq. 
The review showed clearly Iraq's full cooperation with the 
United Nations and its Special Commission and the need to lift 
the Iraq blockade in accordance with Paragraph 22 of Resolution 
687. 
  The Pakistani foreign minister stressed his country's 
position toward lifting the Iraq blockade, which is in harmony 
with the progress that Iraq has made and Iraq's positive 
response to the efforts of the United Nations and the Special 
Commission. 
  The two sides assessed the performance of the nonaligned 
conference over the past two days and the dialogues that called 
for reviving the role of the Nonaligned Movement in light of the 
current world developments. The two sides had identical views.

  [Text] During his participation in the NAM [Nonaligned 
Movement] Intersummit Meeting in Cairo from 31 May to 2 June, 
[Thai] Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri held a 
meeting with his Libyan counterpart to clarify the controversy 
over the Libyan Government's repatriation of Thai workers. He 
informed the Libyan foreign minister, who also came to Cairo to 
attend the nonaligned meeting, that the whole problem can be 
attributed to a misunderstanding among several concerned parties 
including the Thai mass media. Citing the vote Thailand cast 
for Libya at the World Health Organization, he told his Libyan 
counterpart that Thailand always supports Libya, adding that 
Thailand has never thought of making any false charges against 
that country. He said only two out of 60 Thai job placement 
firms were involved in sending Thai workers to Libya without 
government permission. He asked that the Libyan foreign 
minister clarify his country's policy toward Thai workers. 
  The Libyan foreign minister replied that as a matter of 
fact, 
Libya has no bias against Thai workers. Preventive measures 
against law violations have been applied to workers from all 
countries, not specifically Thailand. The Libyan people admire 
and praise Thai workers for their honesty, diligence, and 
workmanship, and learned about Thailand from them. 
  The Libyan foreign minister also proposed that the Thai 
Government open an embassy in Libya so that it can look after 
the 25,000 Thai workers there more closely and further 
strengthen bilateral ties. 
  Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri foreign minister replied 
that 
the proposal was accepted for serious consideration and hope 
that Thai workers in Libya will continue to contribute to the 
strengthening of the Thai-Libyan relations.

  [Text] Cairo, 2 Jun (MENA) -- Irfan Ljubijankic, foreign 
minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina, has praised Egypt's role and 
participation in the peace-keeping force in Sarajevo. He noted 
that any Arab and Islamic troops operating within the UN forces 
would be welcomed by his country, particularly after the 
withdrawal of some European troops from Bosnia. Ljubijankic 
expected peace keeping troops from Pakistan, Malaysia, and 
Turkey to arrive in Bosnia. 
  Speaking at a news conference on the sidelines of the 
nonaligned foreign ministers' meeting currently being held in 
Cairo, Ljubijankic added that Bosnia had been reluctant to 
accept a comprehensive cease-fire for fear that the Serbs might 
use the truce to legalize their occupation of Bosnian territory 
and impose a fait-accompli by force. He pointed out that 
Bosnia's acceptance of the European peace plan is conditional on 
ascertaining that the refugees who fled war-stricken Bosnian 
cities would return home. He added: Their return is one of our 
main conditions for accepting the plan. Their return would mean 
a rejection of the tendency to acquire territory by force, he 
added, noting that the return of Muslim refugees to their homes 
would solve the problem. 
  Asked about the prospects for the survival of the federation 
between Muslims and Croats in Bosnia, he said that there are 
cooperation and long-standing common interests between the two 
sides, even if there is no love lost between them. He noted 
that this federation is a new development in the Bosnian war 
that has been proposed by the United States, and it is a good 
idea. He added: We have prepared everything on paper, but what 
counts is the actual implementation on the ground. 
  On his expectations about the chances that peace may be 
established in Bosnia in what is left of 1994, the Bosnian 
foreign minister said that officials would be happy if peace 
were achieved by the end of the year. But he expressed his 
belief that it is hard to persuade Serbia to conclude a peace 
agreement because its policy is based on the annexation of 
territory, and it is very difficult for the Serbs to give up 
this policy. He added that he hopes to meet with a reasonable 
Serbian official with whom he could talk. Noting that peace can 
be achieved with any degree of justice, he ruled out the 
possibility of achieving peace during this year. 
  The Bosnian official praised the efforts of the Nonaligned 
Movement in resolving the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He 
added that in the future his country will seek to gain full 
membership in the movement, noting that it is attending the 
current conference as a guest.

  [Text] Cairo, 3 Jun (MENA) -- Concluding its meetings 
today, the 11th Conference of the Nonaligned Movement's [NAM] 
foreign ministers has approved the Cairo Declaration under the 
slogan "Meeting the Challenge." 
  The Cairo Declaration affirms that the NAM ministers have 
agreed that the response to changes in international relations 
is the most important challenge the movement will face in the 
coming years. 
  The Cairo Declaration stated that the international 
community, while on the threshold of the 21st century, must 
establish the necessary balance between the need to progress and 
the need to change. It also said that the conflict between the 
movement toward international cooperation and economic 
integration on the one hand, and the negative effects of local 
and regional disputes on the other, should be addressed. 
  The declaration stressed the importance of international 
cooperation in the field of social development. It stated that 
to further this aim the NAM's foreign ministers agreed to 
recommend that the heads of states or governments of the 
nonaligned countries participate in the World Summit for Social 
Development in Copenhagen in March 1995. 
  The ministers also stressed the importance of the 
international population conference, which will be held in Cairo 
this September. 
  The Cairo Declaration affirmed the determination of the NAM 
states to closely coordinate among each other on certain 
international issues, such as international peace and security, 
colonialism, occupation, disarmament, development, trade, 
poverty, human rights, and the environment. 
  In this regard, the declaration stressed the determination 
of 
the NAM countries to bolster their ability to respond to the new 
state of affairs in the world to achieve their objectives while 
adhering to their basic principles. 
  The Cairo Declaration affirmed the adherence of the 
nonaligned countries to the process of democratic change within 
the United Nations and to bolster NAM's role in the 
international organization. 
  The following is the text of the Cairo Declaration issued by 
the NAM foreign ministers today: 
<H8>  The Cairo Declaration </H8>
<H5>  Meeting the Challenge </H5>
  The foreign ministers of the nonaligned countries meeting in 
their 11th conference in Cairo, the Arab Republic of Egypt, 
during the period of 31 May-3 June 1994, have reviewed the 
current international state of affairs from all its political, 
economic, and social dimensions and have agreed to respond to 
the changes that have taken place in international relations, 
which constitute the most important challenges the NAM will 
confront in the coming years. 
  The basic principles of the movement have withstood the test 
of time. NAM's adherence to its principles is still strong. It 
is determined to proceed from its achievements in an attempt to 
realize full participation from all sides in determining the 
joint fate of mankind. 
  The ministers are confident that the international 
community, 
while on the threshold of the 21st century, must strike the 
appropriate balance between the need for continuing and the 
obligation for change. It also has to handle the conflict 
between the growing force for progress toward international 
cooperation and economic integration on the one hand, and the 
obstructive results of regional and local disputes on the other. 
It should also bolster national security in its expanded sense, 
which includes economic and social dimensions, joint interests, 
and the sharing of responsibility. 
  The ministers expressed their determination to closely 
coordinate their countries' programs on international issues of 
peace and security, colonialism, occupation, disarmament, 
development, trade, poverty, human rights, and the environment. 
They also decided to work on making the international responses 
to these issues take into consideration the interests of the NAM 
countries. 
  The ministers also decided to strengthen south-south 
cooperation and to continue the dialogue to strengthen 
international economic cooperation for development purposes on 
the basis of mutual interests and benefits and the sharing of 
responsibility and participation. 
  The ministers reaffirmed the importance they attach to 
international cooperation as it relates to social development. 
To achieve this, the ministers agreed to recommend that the 
leaders of countries or governments participate in the World 
Summit on Social Development scheduled to be held in Copenhagen 
in March 1995. 
  The ministers also reaffirmed the importance they attach to 
the International Conference on Population and Development 
scheduled to be held in Cairo in September 1994 and the Fourth 
World Conference on Women scheduled to be held in Beijing in 
September 1995. They also decided to coordinate their efforts 
to ensure the success of these conferences. 
  The ministers declared their intention to continue to 
strengthen NAM's ability to respond to the new world situation 
with the aim of achieving its objectives while remaining 
committed to its basic principles, the soundness of which has 
been proven. 
  The ministers reiterated that the United Nations, as the 
embodiment of plurality, has a unique opportunity to play an 
important role in establishing a world order that is more just, 
fair, prosperous, and secure. 
  They also reiterated their commitment to the UN's democratic 
change process and to strengthening the NAM countries' role and 
participation in this world body. 
  The ministers decided to add a new dynamism to NAM with the 
aim of enabling its members to enter the 21st century as a 
constructive and lively force in the international arena. They

  [Text] Israeli Foreign Minister Peres met King Hassan of 
Morocco last night in Rabat. In their meeting, the king 
rejected Israel's request to establish diplomatic relations 
between the two countries. Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports. 
  [Begin Hecht recording] The birth of the peace process 
approximately one year ago was accompanied by impressive 
political dividends: bonuses from Washington, cries of 
hallelujah from Western capitals, and mainly public expressions 
of friendliness from Arab states. Over the past few months, 
enthusiasm seems to have waned and the region's capitals are 
giving Jerusalem the cold shoulder. Among other things, this 
has been reflected in opinion polls by a sharp drop in the 
percentage of public support for the peace process. 
  Jerusalem is in need of some fireworks and King Hassan of 
Morocco told Foreign Minister Peres that he was not the address. 
I can be friendly towards Israel, the king explained, our 
security services can readily cooperate with each other, but the 
time is still not ripe for diplomatic relations. The king 
stressed that his unique status in the Arab League permitted him 
to act effectively on regional issues and establishing 
diplomatic relations with Israel would, in his opinion, 
terminate this state of affairs. 
  This week, the Moroccan king received Labor Knesset Member 
[MK] Rafi Edri on two occasions. On the first occasion, Edri 
was accompanied by Mrs. Feldman, the mother of soldier Tzvi 
Feldman who has been missing in action since the battle of 
al-Sultan Ya'qub. The king promised to do all he could, 
stressing that this matter was beyond politics and that he 
considered it an important humanitarian effort. In their second 
meeting, Edri handed the king a letter from Prime Minister 
Rabin. King Hassan surprised MK Edri when, in a rare gesture, 
he awarded him the Moroccan officers' order, which is a very 
highly regarded commendation. Shim'on Peres hoped to score some 
tangible political achievements in Rabat; however, all the signs 
indicate that he will have to be satisfied with a profuse 
display of sympathy. It is nevertheless possible that Hassan 
may accede to Peres' request to host an international economic 
convention in Rabat within the framework of the multilateral 
process headed by the foreign minister. [end recording] 
  [Jerusalem THE JERUSALEM POST in English on 3 June in a page 
1 report by David Makovsky adds that "Senior officials in 
Jerusalem were seeking to dampen earlier expectations that the 
two countries would agree on establishing diplomatic interests 
as the first stage toward diplomatic relations." The report 
points out that "These senior officials categorically denied 
that the trip was designed to set up a back-channel for talks 
with Syria," noting that "Israeli officials insist that the 
Hassan-Peres meeting should be seen in a bilateral, economic 
context."]

  Al-Muntasir added that Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid informed him that 
the nonaligned foreign ministers with whom he met on the

Libya's stance on its dispute with the West, particularly as 
Libya has been responsive to all international demands.

Libyan-Western dispute in an internationally legal framework 
while at the same time safeguarding Libyan sovereignty.

  [Text] Cairo, 2 Jun (MENA) -- Bosnian Foreign Minister 
Irfan Ljubijankic has stated that the International Conference 
Organization's liaison group at its meeting yesterday evening 
endorsed a peace plan for Bosnia submitted by Malaysia. In a 
statement made after his meeting with Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa 
today, he said that this plan will be issued as a separate 
resolution on Bosnia calling for an international peace 
conference under UN auspices. 
  Ljubijankic expressed his hope that this resolution will 
enjoy international support, particularly because it receives 
major support from the Nonaligned Movement and the Islamic 
countries. 
  Discussing the statement released by the Yugoslav Foreign 
Ministry regarding Egypt's refusal to invite Serbia and 
Montenegro to attend the conference, Ljubijankic said that 
Serbia is an aggressive country and it is only natural not to 
invite it to attend this gathering. He noted that the refusal 
to send an invitation was in line with the agreement reached 
among the nonaligned countries in New York. He said that there 
is an agreement among these countries not to invite Serbia. The 
proof of this is that none of the conference committees raised 
the issue, he said. 
  Ljubijankic said that he held amicable talks with Musa on 
the 
situation in Bosnia and the topics on the summit's agenda. He 
pointed out that Musa affirmed Egypt's support for Bosnia, 
noting that an agreement was reached to open an Egyptian Embassy 
in Sarajevo. He expressed his satisfaction that his country was 
invited to participate in the Nonaligned Movement Conference. 
He said that Bosnia is the legal heir of the former Yugoslavia.

  [Text] Here is a report from the news desk: 
  Press reports a short while ago said that PLO Chairman Yasir 
'Arafat is suffering from a serious deterioration in his health 
condition that might require moving him from Tunis. He is 
expected to be taken to the royal hospital [King Husayn's 
medical center in Amman] this evening or tomorrow. 
  Reports circulating among Palestinian leaders this morning 
indicated that 'Arafat's health has entered a serious stage. 
Denying this, Mrs. 'Arafat said that 'Arafat was suffering from

Yasir 'Arafat, in Tunis by Nidal Qabalan in London on 2 June --

  [Text] [Mrs. 'Arafat] First of all, I would like to thank 
MBC for its interest in Abu-'Ammar's [Yasir 'Arafat] health. I 
assure you that there is no call for concern. Abu-'Ammar is in 
good health. He is only somewhat exhausted and has the flu; 
that is all there is to it. He will resume activity tonight. 
He is just a little tired. It is a very mild case of influenza. 
  Brother Nidal, you have noticed that for two weeks -- after 
the issue of his statement about jihad in Johannesburg -- there 
has been a series of rumors about Abu-'Ammar, his family, and 
about his illness. Now there is another rumor that he has been, 
or will be, taken to the hospital in Amman. 
  [Qabalan] Then the illness you say the Palestinian president 
has overcome will not affect his commitments, engagements, and 
his forthcoming visit to Jericho in the near future? 
  [Mrs. 'Arafat] Reassure our people inside that Abu-'Ammar 
will be on time. He is in good health. There is absolutely no 
call for concern. 
  [Qabalan] Mrs. 'Arafat, thank you.

  [Text] Tunis, June 3 (AFP) -- PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat 
resumed work late Thursday [2 June] after a day and a half's 
rest to recover from recent trips to neighbouring Algeria and 
Mauritania, a PLO spokesman said. 
  The spokesman denied reports that the 64-year-old Palestine 
Liberation Organisation leader was seriously ill and requiring 
hospital treatment, saying only that he had been tired. 
  'Arafat met late Thursday with former Swedish foreign 
minister Sten Anderson, an old friend, and the spokesman said 
the meeting would be filmed to show that "malevolent rumours" 
about his health were false. 
  A senior Palestinian official, PLO Executive Committee 
member 
Samir Ghawshah, said Thursday that 'Arafat was suffering from 
influenza and had been confined to bed at his Tunis home since 
Wednesday. 
  Doctors recommended that he get plenty of rest, but he was 
not expected to receive treatment in hospital, Ghawshah told AFP. 
  However a hospital source said that 'Arafat had been 
admitted 
to the Tunis military hospital since meeting three U.S. 
congressmen early Wednesday, following a "cardiac alert." 
  All his appointments until his meeting with Andersen were 
cancelled, including a business conference, a poetry evening and 
an interview with CBS anchorman Dan Rather. 
  The PLO leader, who is due to set up the Palestinian 
self-rule authority in Jericho in two weeks, was treated twice 
last month for exhaustion and stress, spending a night at the 
military hospital in Tunis, Palestinian sources said.

Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin "in the wake of the Israeli 
Government's protest against 'Arafat's statements in South 
Africa;" date not given] 
  [Text] Mr. Prime Minister: 
  Greetings. 
  The PLO reiterates the following with regard to the 
Gaza-Jericho accord signed in Cairo: 
  1. The PLO pledges that the Palestinian Authority, including 
the police and other departments, will work in accordance with 
this agreement and will effect a mechanism for coordination and 
cooperation in the appropriate time. 
  2. The PLO pledges to cooperate with Israel and to help it 
discover the location of and return the Israeli soldiers who are 
still missing, as well as return the bodies of the dead soldiers 
who have not been restored yet. 
  3. The PLO pledges to ask the Palestine National Council, in 
its next session, to officially approve amendments to the PLO 
National Charter in accordance with the pledge included in the 
message signed by the PLO chairman on 9 September 1993 and 
addressed to Israel's prime minister. 
  4. As I enter the Gaza Strip and Jericho area I will use the 
title of the chairman of the Palestinian Authority or the PLO 
chairman, not the president of the state of Palestine. 
  5. I pledge not to take any measures that would change the 
status of Gaza Strip and Jericho area and to discuss this matter 
during the talks for a permanent solution to the situation. 
  6. We pledge to implement Paragraph 3 of Article 4 of the 
accord, which stipulates that we must inform the Government of 
Israel of the names of the Palestinian Authority members in a 
letter to be presented within a week. The appointment of 
authority members will be effective in accordance with letters 
to be exchanged to this effect between the PLO and the 
Government of Israel. Also, any change in the membership of the 
Palestinian Authority will be effective in accordance with 
letters to be exchanged between the PLO and the Government of 
Israel. 
  7. Following the endorsement of the accord, talks will begin 
immediately to grant the authority the powers to implement 
Article 6 of the Declaration of Principles. Both parties will 
work toward exploring possible ways to expand the sphere of 
talks so as to exceed the five fields. [not further identified] 
  8. Both parties will work toward giving momentum to talks in 
light of temporary arrangements in accordance with the 
Declaration of Principles and its objective. 
  9. We are committed to embarking on permanent talks on the 
final status as soon as possible provided that they will not be 
later than the beginning of the third year of the transitional 
period. 
  10. We will decide -- through cooperation with Israel and 
within one month -- on calling the Governments of Jordan and 
Egypt to form a follow-up committee as noted in the Declaration 
of Principles. 
  11. We will assess, together with the Government of Israel, 
all necessary legislation that would help implement the accord. 
  12. We are ready to continue discussion on the following 
issues: 
  A. Jericho area. 
  B. Allowing an official Palestinian presence on bridges. 
  C. Achieving additional measures in the Rafah crossing 
area. 
  D. All suspended issues that are mentioned in the accord. 
  [Signed] Sincerely, Yasir 'Arafat

  [Text] In a letter addressed to the Nonaligned Movement 
conference convening in Cairo, brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 
'Arafat], president of the state of Palestine and chairman of 
the PLO Executive Committee, has said that the statements made 
by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin on Jerusalem cast doubt 
on Israel's willingness to comply with the self-rule accords 
signed with the PLO. 
  Brother President Abu-'Ammar said: The prime minister of the 
Israeli entity made statements in which he said Jerusalem is the 
united capital of Israel forever. Abu-'Ammar added that these 
statements are a violation of the agreement signed in Washington 
on 13 September, particularly with regard to Jerusalem. He said 
that these statements call into question the willingness of 
Israel and its leaders to comply with signed agreements. He 
noted that the Declaration of Principles on the self-rule 
stipulates that the final status of Jerusalem will be discussed 
during the last phase of talks together with the issues of 
settlements and refugees.

  [Text] Cairo, 2 Jun (MENA) -- Dr. Nabil Sha'th, Palestinian 
minister of planning and international cooperation, has accused 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin of violating the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles and said Rabin is 
"bad-tempered." 
  Following his meeting with Arab League Secretary General Dr. 
'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid today, Sha'th said: We will not budge an 
inch from our demand that Jerusalem be the Palestinian state's 
eternal capital. 
  Sha'th criticized the Israeli authorities' closure of the 
Gaza Strip, regarding this act as a violation of the clauses of 
the Palestinian-Israeli Agreement in form and substance. 
  He added: We are doing our utmost to implement the agreement 
and avoid the Israeli authorities' provocations in the Jericho 
area. 
  Addressing Rabin, Sha'th said the Palestinians will not 
accept errors or tolerate them under any circumstances. 
  Sha'th urged the Arab League and Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid to 
continue their backing for the Palestinian National Authority 
and the PLO. He remarked that the Palestinians need help for the 
next five years, particularly in the political and economic 
spheres. 
  Sha'th said he discussed with Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid the Arab 
League's role in the coming days. He specified this role as 
moving on three fronts, involving in the first place continued 
Arab backing for the Palestinians' legitimate rights, overcoming 
any hurdles obstructing the implementation of the 
Palestinian-Israeli Agreement, and assistance in handling the 
still inscrutable Israeli position. 
  He added that Palestine is the only Arab country that 
suffers 
a total occupation of its territory, noting that Gaza and 
Jericho are a first step but the remaining Palestinian 
territories are still occupied. 
  Sha'th said the second front involves greater financial 
assistance from the Arab funds and the third is political and 
media backing for the Palestinian issue at international forums. 
  He announced that the negotiations with Israel will be 
resumed very soon.

<F P=106> [Interview with Furayh Abu-Middayn, "justice minister in the </F>
Palestinian Authority," by Rashid Khashanah in Tunis; date not 
given] 
  [Excerpts] [Khashanah] The "Palestinian Authority's 
program" has underscored the importance of reorganizing the 
judicial system to ensure independence of the judiciary and the 
rule of law. How will that reorganization and the creation of 
national judicial bodies be done? 
  [Abu-Middayn] The judicial bodies are there and the 
Palestinian law existed before the occupation but it needs to be 
adapted to international developments in all fields such as 
international communication and economic relations, and that 
requires legislative adjustment. 
  So far, our legislative powers are limited because the 
autonomy we got does not come up to the level of our aspirations 
but we must amend legislations and adapt to the changes of the 
era. [passage omitted] 
  [Khashanah] In your view, what funds are needed for 
developing the judicial system? 
  [Abu-Middayn] We need two central courts in the Gaza Strip. 
We have requested aid from the United Nations and European 
states and we have set an emergency budget of $4.5 million. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Khashanah] Rabin has challenged the PLO's decision to 
abolish the Israeli military orders issued after the occupation. 
How is the justice ministry tackling this situation? 
  [Abu-Middayn] The aim of the decision was to restore the 
situation which existed before June 1967. Rabin should know 
that all the orders and legislations introduced after that date 
in violation of the Geneva conventions are not sacrosanct as far 
as we are concerned. Rabin did not understand the significance 
of our decision. He has withdrawn his forces and, therefore, 
the role of his military courts and their interference in 
civilian affairs is at an end. We have decided to abolish the 
extraordinary measures. We, of course, will not take his place 
on the basis of his own laws in the framework of military courts 
but we will restore the judicial powers of the civilian courts. 
  What Rabin said was a violation of the Geneva conventions 
and 
the Hague agreement. It reflects a desire to continue to link 
the Gaza Strip to Israel and make it a permanent nest for 
hatching cheap labor in Israel's interests. Logic dictates 
abolition of the emergency laws which were introduced 
illegitimately and unconstitutionally. [passage omitted] 
  [Khashanah] What are the expected legislative repercussions 
of the promulgation of the Palestinian constitution? 
  [Abu-Middayn] Rabin has expressed displeasure at the steps 
we have taken, especially in connection with the promulgation of 
the Palestinian constitution, but our constitution was actually 
issued in 1922 under the British mandate and it was later 
modernized in the days of 'Abd-al-Nasir in 1962. It is an 
advanced constitution because it guarantees personal and public 
freedoms and carefully regulates powers. When we talk about the 
return of Jerusalem, Rabin says that Jerusalem is the soul of 
the Jewish people, forgetting that there were no Jews in East 
Jerusalem before 1967 but then they brought in tens of thousands 
of Jewish immigrants. So the ratio went from 0:100 percent to 
50-50, that is 150,000 Arabs and 150,000 Jews. Furthermore, 
Jerusalem does not just belong to us. People in Fes, Maknas, 
Mecca, Baghdad, and Malaysia have a right to it. We are 
advocates of peace but the Palestinians see the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement, despite its many flaws and shortcomings, as a step 
toward a final settlement based on Resolutions 242 and 338. 
  [Khashanah] Do you not believe that Israeli measures such 
as the closure of the Gaza Strip and the postponement of the 
implementation of the economic agreement confirm that, with the 
present imbalance of powers, the Israeli views prevail? 
  [Abu-Middayn] Israel wants to go all the way in aborting the 
peace process. It wants out of the Gaza Strip because it 
considers that to be in its favor, and also it wants to show the 
world that we failed to produce a model of coexistence and 
failed to manage our own affairs. [passage omitted] 
  We realize that the closure of the Gaza Strip is not in the 
interest of peace and that open borders, work for the 
Palestinians in Israel, and mutual benefits are factors that 
would strengthen peace. Closure of borders would mean wars 
within 10 or 15 years. The Palestinians are today in a weak 
position but they have a "secret" key which is passive power, if 
that is the right expression. We can overturn the table in the 
entire peace process. Israel cannot possibly succeed in 
establishing peace and achieving security for itself unless 
Palestinian rights are fulfilled. [passage omitted] 
  Israel should know that the age of imperialism and 
occupation 
is gone and that we will be good neighbors but would never be 
subservient if it tried to impose hegemony and occupation on us. 
  [Khashanah] What are the ramifications of the postponement 
of the implementation of the economic agreements? 
  [Abu-Middayn] Egypt is on our southern border and Jordan is 
on our eastern border. If Israel wants these to be the borders 
between us and it then that would be fine and we will open lines 
with our brothers in Egypt and Jordan for water, oil, and 
everything our economy needs. [passage omitted] 
  [Khashanah] How will the Justice Ministry handle the issue 
of the Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons and detention 
camps? 
  [Abu-Middayn] That is the most serious, complex, and urgent 
issue today. It is the issue that will determine the 
credibility, or lack of it, of any step we take in the eyes of 
the Palestinian people. 
  The issue of the prisoners should not be used for political 
blackmail and bargaining. [passage omitted] The recent Cairo 
agreement provides for the release of 5,000 detainees within 
five weeks from the date the agreement was signed but Israel has 
only released 1,200-1,300. That constitutes a violation of the 
agreement. [passage omitted] 
  We will tackle this issue continuously, particularly as 
there 
is an agreement on this matter despite Israeli maneuvering 
attempts. I do not reveal a secret by saying that Israel 
believes that the Palestinians know what happened to the bodies 
of three of its soldiers killed during the 1982 siege of Beirut. 
It is trying to use that as a bargaining card. Morally and 
religiously, we Arabs and Muslims could not possibly keep these 
bodies for such a long time. The Israelis should show goodwill 
and release the 5,000 detainees as agreed, even gradually. 
  We know that there are conflicts and that there is right and 
left. 
  That leaves the major files. We have rejected the 
classification of detainees (Fatah, Hamas, and so on) because we 
do not view the matter from a factional or partisan angle. 
Israel has raised the issue of written undertakings although it 
had been agreed that the detainees should not be asked to give 
any pledge or undertaking because that is a matter for the 
detainee and his conscience, and it is rejected. If a prisoner 
signs an undertaking of submission, that would have no legal 
value and would not be binding on the person signing it. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Khashanah] There are about 20,000 weapons in Gaza, mostly 
in the hands of ordinary citizens not organizations. How will 
that issue be tackled? 
  [Abu-Middayn] The Palestinian police chief has announced 
that there will be no objection to people keeping their licensed 
arms, provided they apply for them according to the law. There 
are 3,500 settlers in the Gaza Strip and they possess arms. We 
therefore do not request withdrawal of the arms from the hands 
of the Palestinian citizens but request control of the hand that 
holds the gun. In other words, it should be a clean and honest 
hand with the sole aim of protection in the event of appearance 
of crminal gangs in our society. Within days, Israel will be 
handing over to us some 400 civilian prisoners held in 
connection with criminal cases (murder and drug smuggling). We 
do not want arms to fall into the hands of these people lest 
they blackmail and rob people. So, at first we will ban the 
possession of arms in the streets but we will not storm homes in 
search of arms. Anyone who seeks a license and pays the fees 
according to the law may do so, and each case will be considered 
on merit. As regards organizations, if arms are necessary we 
would perhaps consider having them assembled in certain places 
by the organizations. That is an example. Some ideas are under 
study and will be discussed with a view to reaching agreement 
but everyone should know that the security of the Palestinian 
people is more important than the security of the organizations, 
and that the possession of arms should be subject to legal 
procedures. These are just rules and are not directed at anyone 
or meant to liquidate the existing organizations, for we are 
against liquidating them. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Asad Mubarak, the general prosecutor of the local 
judicial system in Judaea and Samaria, has said that ever since 
the autonomy was established in Jericho, there has been no 
contact between his judicial system and that of Jericho. He 
noted that the Palestinian Authority had appointed a new 
judicial system in Jericho consisting of a prosecutor, a judge, 
and administrative staffers. 
  Our correspondent Mira Amsalem reports that Justice Minister 
David Liba'i heard Mubarak's remarks during a tour of the court 
system in Ramallah. In the course of the visit, Minister Liba'i 
rejected 'Arafat's demand to terminate the application of 
Israeli military laws in the territories. The justice minister 
said that the Palestinian Authority has jurisdiction in Gaza and 
Jericho only. He pointed out that according to the Israeli-PLO 
agreement, the Palestinian Authority does not have to extradite 
murderers and terrorists to Israel.

<F P=106> [Report by Mahmud Abu-'Id: "Palestinian Official Tells </F>
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: Jordan Not Dealing With Us as Economic 
Partner; `Commission-Seekers' Biggest Threat to the Palestinian 
Entity"] 
  [Excerpts] Amman, Jerusalem -- Commenting on the draft 
Palestinian-Jordanian agreement, Ibrahim Abu-'Ayyash, member of 
the Palestine Central Council and the Palestine National 
Council, has said in a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the 
agreement between the two sides is necessary and important. But 
the main obstacle lies in the nature of the Jordanian side's 
view of the Palestinians, which I believe does not regard the 
two sides as equal partners, but, rather, as a superior and a 
subordinate. 
  Abu-'Ayyash said that the nature of this view is worrying 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, and that the main problem 
is that "they continue to talk to us on the basis that we are 
part of Jordan, not on the basis of our independence." [passage 
omitted] 
  Furthermore, Abu-'Ayyash said that the transitional phase 
involves great dangers, especially in view of rumors that 
Palestinian officials have become agents for international 
companies to distribute their commodities in the areas 
controlled by the Palestinian authority -- a phenomenon now 
known as the "commission-seekers" phenomenon. 
  In this context Abu-'Ayyash said: "Regrettably, rumors have 
cited names of figures close to Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat." However, he added: "Nevertheless, matters are still 
within the framework of rumors. But the important thing is for 
the Palestinian leadership to understand the seriousness of the 
stage ahead and thus not link its destiny with Israel, but with 
the Arab states." 
  He pointed out that the biggest threat to the new 
Palestinian 
entity is those who are trying to be clever. [passage omitted]

  [Text] We in the Hamas Movement have heard the statements 
of 'Abbas Zaki, in which he alleged that the Hamas Movement has 
agreed, in principle, to take part in what he called the 
Palestinian Authority. 
  We state that these statements contain no truth whatsoever, 
are completely fabricated, and are designed to confuse the 
position of the Hamas Movement, which strongly rejects the 
infamous Cairo agreement. 
  The source added: The Hamas Movement reiterates its 
rejection of participation, in any form, in the authority of the 
feeble self-rule, and that no agreement was reached to hold any 
meetings with Fatah. Moreover, 'Abbas Zaki's claim that there 
is a draft covenant of honor between Fatah and the Alliance of 
Palestinian Forces has no truth and is designed to enhance the 
ugly image of self-rule and 'Arafat's leadership following the 
signing of the agreement of relinquishment in Cairo.

    [Editorial report] Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew on 
3 June carries a 200-word report by Roni Shaqed and David Regev 
stating: "Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] leaders in the 
territories and outside are discussing the possibility of 
turning the movement into a political party to operate -- during 
the first stage -- in the Gaza and Jericho autonomy area. 
  "By adopting this approach Hamas wants to preserve its 
political power and become an element which will participate in 
elections to institutions and organizations -- including the 
self-rule bodies. 
  "Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar, one of Hamas' leaders in the Gaza 
Strip, has confirmed that his movement is examining the 
possibility of turning into a political party similar to other 
political parties in the territories, including Fatah. He noted 
that the establishment of a party does not change the movement's 
thinking or strategy, but rather constitutes a way to advance 
its cause among the public." 
  A 600-word report by Yosi Torpstein on page A10 of HA'ARETZ 
on 3 June says that "Hamas and the Democratic Front may join 
Fatah in establishing a temporary municipal council in Nabulus. 
In a meeting this week attended by all organizations and 
institutions in Nabulus, Hamas made its agreement conditional 
upon support of all the political forces in the city and 
preparations for elections to be held in the near future." 
  The report adds that "the contacts toward the establishment 
of a municipal council are directed by attorney Ghassan 
al-Shak'ah, who was appointed by 'Arafat and who enjoys the 
support of most Fatah activists in Nabulus. Al-Shak'ah noted 
that he intends to set up a committee for managing city affairs 
in the next year -- after which elections are to be held, 
according to al-Shak'ah. He noted that the municipal committee 
will maintain contacts with the self- government authority in 
Gaza and Jericho." 
  HA'ARETZ adds: "Sources in Nabulus explain that a municipal 
council is necessary because international aid for municipal 
development is conditional upon an authoritative local body 
which will maintain contacts with donors. They added that most 
political bodies in the city recognize the importance of 
financial aid for municipal development, and that most of the 
population supports this move." 
  An 800-word report by Yehuda Litani on page 8 of Tel Aviv 
SHISHI in Hebrew on 3 June, however, accentuates the growing 
tension between the Palestinian police and Hamas in the Gaza 
Strip. The report says that "General Nasr Yusuf, the commander 
of the Palestinian army and police forces in the Gaza Strip, 
this week almost issued a sharp public warning to Hamas, but was 
prevented from doing so at the last minute by Yasir 'Arafat." 
The report notes that Gen. Yusuf and PLO officials in the strip 
were angered by Hamas' execution of two suspected collaborators, 
contrary to the orders issued by Gen. Yusuf immediately after he 
entered the Gaza Strip. 
  The report goes on to say that "there is great tension 
between the two organizations in the Gaza Strip, and according 
to Palestinian sources in Gaza 'one match could ignite the 
entire area.'" The sources add that any further Hamas activity 
which is not coordinated with the PLO, and Gen. Yusuf in 
particular, "could result in direct and violent confrontation 
between the Palestinian Authority members and Hamas in the Gaza 
Strip." In a meeting with Gaza journalists, Gen. Yusuf issued a 
sharp warning to Hamas "not to undertake independent operations 
which are not coordinated with official security elements." The 
report adds that the tension between the organizations was 
exacerbated by the detention of an Islamic Jihad activist 
suspected of involvement in the murder of two Israeli soldiers 
and by Gen. Yusuf's call on Hamas and Islamic Jihad to hand over 
their weapons, a call which has been publicly defied by Hamas. 
  The reports ends: "Gen. Yusuf, who considers himself to be 
the supreme commander of the Palestinian security forces in the 
autonomy, regards Hamas rejection of his demands as a direct 
challenge posed by the Islamic organizations and an attempt to 
undermine his authority."

  [Text] The JKLF [Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front] 
president, Mr. Yasin Malik, had a narrow escape in a murderous 
attack on his life by the militants of rival group Hizbul 
Mojahedin in Srinagar today. Mr. Malik told a press conference 
that the militants of Hizbul Mojahedin tried to kidnap him from 
SMHS Hospital in Srinagar, but his supporters foiled the 
attempt. The Hizbul Mojahedin then fired several rounds toward 
Malik, but he escaped unhurt as the people surrounded him. 
  The attack on Mr. Malik comes in the wake of the killing of 
three top functionaries of JKLF by Hizbul Mojahedin since last 
night. Mr. Malik held a demonstration against these killings 
and over 10,000 people participated in the procession, which 
raised slogans against Pakistan and Hizbul Mojahedin militants.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Victory of a Sort"] </F>
  [Text] By-election results usually convey only a limited 
message. Nevertheless, going by the number of seats it has won 
in the by-elections, the Congress can afford to be in a 
triumphant mood although the defeat it has suffered in certain 
constituencies points to the long way it has still to go to make 
its position sound and strong. The party can certainly pat 
itself on the back for bagging five of the seven Lok Sabha seats 
and five of the 10 Assembly seats. Its triumph in the Ahmednagar 
and Baramati constituencies in Maharashtra signifies Chief 
Minister Sharad Pawar's political clout in the State whereas in 
Madhya Pradesh, where it has bagged both the Rajgarh Lok Sabha 
seat and the Chachoda Assembly seat, the architect of victory is 
in a large measure Chief Minister Digvijay Singh himself. In 
Punjab, Chief Minister Beant Singh's hands have been 
strengthened by the party's creditable performance in Nakodar. 
The Bharatiya Janata Party can draw some comfort from its 
victory in the Meerut Lok Sabha constituency in UP [Uttar 
Pradesh] and in the Rajakhera Assembly constituency in 
Rajasthan. But it has reason to feel disturbed over its dismal 
performance in Madhya Pradesh and its loss of the Hamirpur 
Assembly seat in Himachal Pradesh to the Congress. The 
limitations of Hindutva card should dawn on the party. 
  Though the Left parties have not been put to a severe test, 
the Revolutionary Socialist Party has fared well by winning the 
Barampore Lok Sabha seat in West Bengal. Similarly, the Left 
Front in Kerala can celebrate the triumph of the Independent 
candidate backed by it in the Guruvayoor Assembly constituency. 
But it was mainly Muslim politics rather than party politics 
that decided the outcome of the by-election. What a pity that 
in a state like Kerala both the Congress and the Left parties 
unabashedly depend upon the communal forces for their survival 
and votes! From Kurnool in Andhra Pradesh where the Congress 
has defeated its Telugu Desam rival with a reduced margin, the 
message is clear: Unless the Congress sets its house in order, 
it will face a serious challenge from Mr N. T. Rama Rao's party. 
  The Congress has only itself to blame for finding itself in 
a 
hopeless situation in Tamil Nadu. It remains to be seen whether 
the party can regain in the near future even partly the ground 
it has lost. In the Perundurai Assembly constituency where the 
AIADMK [All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam] has registered 
a spectacular victory, the Congress came only fourth. The same 
is the story in the Mylapore Assembly constituency. The 
Congress is thus highly vulnerable in the southern States which 
were once its fortress. In Tamil Nadu, the party has paid a 
heavy price for its dilemma whether it should align with the DMK 
[Dravida Munnetra Kzhagam] or the AIADMK or stand on its own. 
The sooner it adopts a united stand and spells out a definite 
strategy, the better it is for the party. In Kerala, where 
Chief Minister K. Karunakaran is becoming more and more a 
liability to the Congress, a change in leadership may be worth 
considering.

  [Text] Cairo, 2 Jun (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has 
explained that the UN Security Council resolution pertaining to 
a cease-fire in Yemen is a "resolution that deals with the 
tragic situation of a nation whose northern and southern parts 
are fighting each other, namely an unacceptable situation." 
  Commenting further on the Security Council resolution, he 
explained that Egypt was one of the countries that sought this 
resolution because it is totally unacceptable to talk of unity 
by force. He added that it is very doubtful that a unity 
brought about by force can continue even if one of the warring 
factions defeats the other. He explained: "It is a very 
serious matter and would constitute an unacceptable precedent." 
  Asked what he thinks will happen if the Security Council 
resolution is not implemented, Musa said: "If the resolution is 
not implemented, we will handle things as they come."

  [Text] Cairo, 2 Jun (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has 
expressed his deep concern at today's Israeli raid on Lebanon. 
He noted that Lebanon's sovereignty must be respected and any 
violation thereof is unacceptable. 
  In remarks he made this evening, Musa added that the raid 
could negatively affect the peace process, noting that such acts 
are not acceptable for dealing with the existing problems. The 
foreign minister emphasized that Egypt clearly stands for the 
protection of Lebanon's sovereignty and called on Israel to stop 
such actions. 
  Asked about Egypt's position regarding Lebanon's request to 
convene an urgent session of the Security Council to discuss the 
raid, Musa said that Lebanon naturally and undoubtedly has a 
right to make such request. 
  Asked about Israel's claim that the objectives of its raid 
are purely military and not political, Musa said: We are now 
talking about peace, not military objectives. He added: If we 
want to give impetus to the peace process and create an 
atmosphere of peace, such measures are uncalled for. 
  Asked if the nonaligned foreign ministers had discussed the 
raid, Musa said they had not, but it is possible that this issue 
may be raised at tomorrow's meetings.

  [Text] Cairo, 2 Jun (MENA)--Two Egyptian experts returned 
to Cairo from Khartoum today after the Sudanese authorities 
refused, without giving a reason, to let them enter Sudan. 
  Engineer Muhammad Amin Muhammadayn, former Irrigation 
Ministry under secretary and technical adviser to the Nile Water 
Authority; and Dr. Muhammad Jasir, also a former Irrigation 
Ministry under secretary and currently a professor at the 
Institute of River Silt and Hydrology, left for Khartoum aboard 
an Egyptian plane this morning at the Sudanese Government's 
invitation to discuss several joint cooperation projects. 
  Upon his return to Cairo, engineer Muhammadayn said that the 
Sudanese authorities refused to give any reason for banning him 
and his colleague from entering the country. He said the 
Sudanese told him they will explain the reasons to Egyptian 
Public Works and Water Resources Minister 'Abd-al-Hadi Radi.

  [Excerpts] Israel has continued its acts of aggression 
against Lebanese territory. According to reports from south 
Lebanon this morning, in the past few hours Israeli forces 
bombarded a large number of the central sector villages with 
heavy artillery. In addition, Israeli helicopters flew over 
Tyre and the coastal road from the city up to the western 
sector. The Lebanese Army confronted the Israeli aircraft with 
various types of antiaircraft weapons and prevented them from 
achieving their goals. [passage omitted] 
  We have just received the following report from the editor's 
desk: According to the NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY correspondent in 
al-Nabatiyah, Israeli warplanes flew at low altitude over 
al-Nabatiyah and Iqlim al-Tuffah between 0630 and 0710 this 
morning. The Lebanese Army ground defenses engage the planes. 
The al-Litani River basin and nearby areas came under an 
artillery barrage from the Israeli positions in Tallat 'Alman 
and Tallat al-Shumariyah shortly after midnight. The barrage 
was accompanied by machine-gun fire targeting the outskirts of 
Zawtar al-Sharqiyah and Zawtar al-Gharbiyah. Israeli warplanes 
continued to fly over the south all last night and dropped 
dozens of flares. Israeli aircraft continue to fly over the 
south.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] This morning the Lebanese Army 
engaged Israeli aircraft as they staged numerous low-altitude 
sorties over al-Nabatiyah and Iqlim al-Tuffah. The Israeli 
enemy's artillery has been bombarding several areas in the 
south. The NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY correspondent in al-Nabatiyah 
reports: 
  [Correspondent] Since 0630 this morning Israeli warplanes 
have not left the area. They are flying at very low altitude 
and staging mock raids over the al-Nabatiyah and Iqlim al-Tuffah 
areas. The Lebanese Army ground defenses in both areas are 
confronting the aircraft. At 0800 today, Israeli artillery 
began bombarding Tallat Mlita in Iqlim al-Tuffah. The same area 
came under a similar barrage after midnight. Al-Luwayzah came 
under an Israeli barrage from the al-Zaffatah positions. The 
barrage was accompanied by shelling of the al-Litani River basin 
and nearby areas from Tallat 'Alman and Tallat al-Shumariyah. 
The Israelis directed machine-gun fire at Zawtar al-Gharbiyah 
and Zawtar al-Sharqiyah. The Israeli planes staged numerous 
flights over al-Nabatiyah and Iqlim al-Tuffah last night and 
dropped dozens of flares. [passage omitted] 
  [Announcer] Several areas in the south, notably the Tyre 
area, came under violent artillery bombardment after midnight 
last night amid numerous Israeli overflights. The Lebanese Army 
engaged the Israeli aircraft with all types of antiaircraft 
fire. The NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY correspondent in Tyre reports: 
  [Correspondent] The Israeli enemy escalated its aggression 
at 
midnight last night. The villages of the south, particularly in 
the western and central sectors, experienced a difficult night 
as the enemy and its Lahdist [South Lebanese Army] agents 
committed acts of aggression against peaceful villages. At 
about midnight, the bombardment was extended to the outskirts of 
Srifa, where four 155-mm rounds fell. Since 0030, the Israeli 
aircraft have been staging mock raids. The planes are flying at 
very low altitude over the area The Lebanese Army's artillery 
has engaged the Israeli aircraft. 
  Israeli gunboats raked the southern coast with machine-gun 
fire last night. The bombardment continued until O200. Several 
155-mm shells landed in the outskirts of Kafra, Yatar, and Haris 
from the Israeli positions in Muhaybib. Israeli helicopters 
flew over the entire coastal area up to the villages adjacent to 
the border zone, dropping flares. The Israeli aircraft flew 
over the area until 0800 today. 
  Panic is gripping the citizens, while the resistance is 
massing its forces.

<F P=106> [News conference by Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz with </F>
unidentified correspondents at Foreign Ministry Headquarters in 
Beirut on 2 June--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Correspondent] At dawn today a massacre was 
committed in the 'Ayn Zarzarah area of Ba'labakk. Would you 
tell us what measures Lebanon will adopt to confront Israeli 
aggression? 
  [Buwayz] The military operation that the Israeli army 
conducted at dawn today is a blatant aggression on Lebanese 
sovereignty and security. It also constitutes a major challenge 
to the peace process. We believe that this operation is 
tantamount to an all-out war against Lebanon. It clearly 
reveals Israel's intentions concerning the peace process, 
contrary to what it says to the world -- pretending to seek 
peace. 
  In a few moments, the Higher Defense Council will convene. 
It will review the details of this operation before adopting a 
suitable stand. 
  [Correspondent] Is Lebanon going to file a complaint with 
the 
UN Security Council concerning this massacre? 
  [Buwayz] I believe that the proper decision will be adopted 
after reviewing the various aspects of the matter. It should be 
noted that the massacre has claimed some 45 lives so far. 
  [Correspondent] Was one of the objectives of that operation 
to cover up the issue of Israel's diversion of Lebanese water? 
  [Buwayz] As far as the issue of water is concerned, I would 
like to be accurate about this matter. Of course, Israel's 
intentions and ambitions in Lebanese lands and water are neither 
surprising nor new. Information circulated over past few years 
is not new. We repeatedly wrote to the United Nations with 
requests to send fact-finding committees to verify information 
that we received from several sources. The UN reply clearly 
emphasized that there was no evidence of water theft, either on 
the surface or underground, through pipes, pumps, or tunnels. 
[passage omitted] 
  In any case, we sent a message to UN Secretary General Dr. 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali this morning, requesting him to dispatch an 
experts committee to inspect al-Khardali area and tell us 
whether Israel is, or is not, stealing water directly or 
indirectly. Hence, we are waiting for the UN findings after its 
contacts with UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia 
[ESCWA]. 
  I believe that UN official spokesman Timor Goksel made a 
statement this morning, which said that press reports citing 
international forces are false, that these forces took part in 
no committee, and that they have no information on the issue. 
  Hence, we are waiting for the UN secretary general to 
appointment an experts committee, instead of relying on 
speculations or analysis that can never be accepted as 
documents. If circulated reports are confirmed, we will file a 
complaint with the UN Security Council, demanding the adoption 
of the necessary measures. 
  [Correspondent] There is an impression that you and Chamber 
of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri disagree on this matter, 
particularly since your return from Amman. 
  [Buwayz] Speaker Birri made statements yesterday based on 
press reports. We cannot rely on press reports alone. We have 
assessed what we received from ESCWA and discovered ESCWA does 
not adopt a specific stand on circulated information. This 
information is not based on findings of a specific committee or 
a field inspection; it is based on analysis and estimates. We 
share ESCWA's concern over Lebanon's waters. But there is a big 
difference between this concern and documented facts. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Statement by Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul, followed by </F>
remarks in answer to questions by unidentified correspondents, 
at the Presidential Palace in B'abda on 2 June--recorded] 
  [Text] Following the sinful Israeli assault against Lebanon 
at dawn today, the Higher Defense Council [HDC] held a meeting 
under the chairmanship of his excellency the president in the 
presence of his excellency the prime minister and the other 
ministers who are members of the HDC. 
  Army Commander General Lahhud briefed the HDC on the details 
of the Israeli assault. He said that the Army, immediately 
after monitoring the hostile planes, informed all the concerned 
departments and confronted the enemy with all available weapons 
in all operational areas. 
  After discussing the issue, the HDC expressed satisfaction 
with the Army's prompt response. 
  His excellency the foreign minister was again instructed to 
lodge a complaint with the UN Security Council and ask it to 
hold a session to discuss this barbaric assault. 
  The HDC instructed his excellency the health minister to let 
the hospitals admit and give treatment to all people injured in 
the attack at the Health Ministry's expense. 
  Lebanon emphasizes its legitimate right to resist the 
occupation and confront its assaults with all available means. 
It asserts that these Israeli assaults and pressure, regardless 
of how intense they become, will not make it submit or back down 
from its firm patriotic stance. 
  [Correspondent] Minister, we notice that Israel has recently 
escalated its assaults in more than one area in the south. Do 
you expect the situation to escalate further and expand? 
  [Dallul] We expect Israel to perpetrate every possible 
abomination with the aim of undermining domestic conditions in 
Lebanon. After it failed to achieve anything via its agents, it 
personally intervened in Lebanese affairs to confuse matters and 
drive a wedge between Lebanon and those who confront the Israeli 
occupation. We wish to stress that this Israeli policy, no 
matter how assiduously pursued, will not make us submit or 
cooperate with Israel. We are cooperating with our people to 
end the occupation. We back those who confront Israel because 
the people of any occupied country have the right to resist the 
occupation with all available means. 
  [Correspondent] Minister, one can see that the lack of 
international sympathy with Lebanon's complaint about the 
Israeli act of piracy [abduction of Believers Resistance 
official Mustafa al-Dirani] gave a green light to Israel to 
carry out the current major assault. What does Lebanon plan to 
do in connection with the complaint? 
  [Dallul] We will ask the international community to bear its 
full responsibility. Either there will be an international 
community response to countries' needs to protect their 
citizens, sovereignty, and independence or the international 
community will become a stooge for Israeli objectives and the 
objectives of those who back Israel. We will lodge a new 
complaint so that the international community, particularly the 
UN Security Council, will shoulder its responsibility regarding 
the Israeli assaults. 
  [Correspondent] Minister, the press corps doyen cited the 
president as saying today that Lebanon is no longer surprised 
[words indistinct] if Beirut is attacked using the usual Israeli 
pretexts. What are the limits of the Israeli aggression at this 
stage? 
  [Dallul] It is not important to predict whether Israeli 
attacks will occur or not. Israel is a state founded on 
aggression. The Israeli entity is based on aggression. 
Accordingly, Israel will carry out attacks. It is, therefore, 
important for us to maintain our solidarity and accord to 
prevent Israel from achieving its objectives or goals through 
such attacks. 
  [Correspondent] Will Lebanon adopt an official stand on the 
issue of the Arab-Israeli negotiations if the Israeli attacks 
continue? 
  [Dallul] This depends on the Council of Ministers and the 
Chamber of Deputies. We joined the negotiations after a 
decision by the Chamber of Deputies. However, I believe that if 
Israel continues its attacks we will hear voices calling for 
withdrawal from these negotiations because they will be 
impotent. We will not accept negotiations used as pretexts to 
strike at our people, sons, and areas. You will be surprised to 
learn that young girls were victims of the Israeli attack early 
today. Children of 12 or 13 years old were killed. 
  [Correspondent] Do you believe that [words indistinct]? 
  [Dallul] Nobody will forget anything. Every Israeli act of 
piracy will be remembered. These are acts demonstrating 
Israel's barbarism and bestiality. The Lebanese people are 
victims of such Israeli acts. Israel, which speaks about 
Hitlerism and Nazism, is itself carrying out this method, a 
method not even used by the Nazi regime with such barbarism and 
bestiality. 
  [Correspondent] In your opinion, do you believe that the 
cabinet's meeting on Tuesday [7 June] will adopt a decision 
concerning the negotiations? 
  [Dallul] This, as I said, all depends on the Council 
Ministers and the Chamber of Deputies. We have allies in the 
negotiations. Together we joined the negotiations. We will not 
adopt unilateral decisions. But every one of us wonders about 
the usefulness of such negotiations when Israel is bombing us 
and destroying the sources of livelihood of our people. 
  [Correspondent] Minister, [words indistinct] to avoid 
extensive fighting in the south as happened in the past? 
  [Dallul] We do not interfere in the actions of our sons, who 
are confronting the Israeli occupation. We often said that as 
long as Israel continues to occupy our land, it is the right of 
everyone to resist and liberate this land with all available 
means. When the land is liberated, there will be no weapons 
except those that belong to the legitimate authority [words 
indistinct]. But at present Israel is bombarding us deep inside 
our country. Therefore, I believe we are not the police to 
defend the occupation forces. Defending the occupation troops is 
treason. We are a state which cooperates with its people and 
citizens. Our state is responsible for the sovereignty and 
independence of the homeland. 
  [Correspondent] [Words indistinct]. 
  [Dallul] Our coordination with Syria is continuing, whether 
there are attacks or not. We coordinate with fraternal Syria on 
all issues and in all fields. We have a common fate. Together 
we joined the negotiations and we will continue together. This 
is because we do not bite the hand that helps us. We will 
continue to coordinate efforts with the states that entered the 
negotiations with us, foremost among them being fraternal Syria.

  [Text] Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri today said that the 
recent Israeli aggression against al-Biqa' is within the context 
of a continuous Israeli operation that seeks to steer Lebanon in 
the direction Israel wants for the settlement. Hence, he added, 
I would like to emphasize the following points in the name of 
the Lebanese Government: 
  1. Lebanon in its entirety stands unified against the 
Israeli aggression. The martyrs who fell in al-Biqa' are 
martyrs of all Lebanon; they fell as they defended Lebanon's 
unity, safety, dignity, and sovereignty; 
  2. Lebanon engaged in negotiations in order to liberate its 
lands from occupation. It will not waive the right to liberate 
the land and exercise sovereignty, even under military and 
terrorist pressure and despite Israel's acts of piracy. Lebanon 
will hold on to the positions it opted to assume with its 
brothers, primarily sister Syria, until the Israeli occupation 
fully withdraws; 
  3. The new aggression in al-Biqa' is aggression against 
peace that undermines the regional peace process. Lebanon will 
not agree to be one of the victims of aggression against 
regional peace. Hence, it is entitled to consider any measures 
to protect its existence, sovereignty, and the dignity of its 
people; and, 
  4. The international community, particularly the states 
sponsoring the regional peace process, are invited to adopt a 
clear-cut stance in this connection to put an end to the Israeli 
aggression and rescue peace. The Lebanese Government will 
shoulder its responsibility in that connection and will do 
everything possible to explain its stance at international 
forums.

  [Text] In view of the Israeli treacherous aggression and 
the victims in al-Biqa', Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri held 
talks with President Ilyas al-Hirawi and Chamber Speaker Nabih 
Birri. At the end of the meeting, it was decided to declare 
Friday, 3 June 1994, a day of official mourning in honor of the 
martyrs who fell victim in the dreadful massacre. 
  In condemnation of this grotesque crime, the public and 
private establishments, universities and schools will be closed

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Khalil Makkawi, Lebanon's </F>
Ambassador to the United Nations, in New York, by Sayyid 
al-Miliji, in Cairo; date not given; from the "Dialogue from 
Afar" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Miliji] What steps has the Lebanese Government 
taken to make the Security Council discuss the kidnapping of 
Mustafa al-Dirani? 
  [Makkawi] We asked for an urgent Security Council session to 
discuss the blatant Israeli aggression against Lebanon's 
territorial sanctity and the kidnapping of Lebanese citizen 
Mustafa al-Dirani as soon as we received the Lebanese 
Government's instructions last Saturday. That act was a 
violation of human rights, the UN Charter, and the principles of 
international law. I met with the Security Council chairman for 
that purpose. The issue is now in the hands of the Council and 
consultations are underway to set the date for the session. 
  [Al-Miliji] You have undoubtedly discerned the prevailing 
attitudes of the Security Council members on this issue during 
these consultations. Can you tell us about them? 
  [Makkawi] We immediately started contacting the permanent 
members. The majority of them showed an understanding of 
Lebanon's stance because, as I said, that action was a clear, 
blatant, and unambiguous aggression. We will contact the 
Nonaligned Movement's members in the Security Council to 
undertake the task of supporting and backing this complaint. 
There is an overall understanding within the United Nations of 
Lebanon's stance and demand. 
  [Al-Miliji] Let us take the Security Council's permanent 
five 
members. What exactly is their stance? 
  [Makkawi] With the exception of the United States, which 
does 
not yet have clear instructions, the other countries that we 
have met with--Russia, China, France, and Britain--have shown 
understanding and are ready to respond to the Lebanese demand 
for a session and to let the Security Council make some decision. 
  [Al-Miliji] Haven't you held consultations with the U.S. 
Administration? 
  [Makkawi] I am in touch with the U.S. representative to the 
United Nations. The Lebanese Government is undoubtedly holding 
consultations through our embassy in Washington. 
  [Al-Miliji] Has the U.S. representative told you anything? 
  [Makkawi] They are still studying the issue. We have not 
been informed so far of the final U.S. stance. 
  [Al-Miliji] Going back to the issue of Mustafa al-Dirani and 
its repercussions, what is your opinion of the situation? 
  [Makkawi] Israeli planes staged raids yesterday morning, 
killing dozens of people in the al-Biqa' Valley. We will inform 
the Security Council of this issue. 
  [Al-Miliji] Isn't Mustafa al-Dirani's issue linked to the 
Lebanese resistance activities in south Lebanon, specifically to 
Hizballah's activities? 
  [Makkawi] Al-Dirani is a Lebanese citizen. He was in bed 
when he was kidnapped. The Israeli raid targeted a site in the 
al-Biqa' Valley. As I said, dozens were killed and wounded. 
Hizballah in Lebanon is Lebanese resistance against the Israeli 
occupation. This resistance remains legitimate and recognized 
by the UN charter and international law as long as this 
occupation continues. All the problems in south Lebanon are 
caused by Israel's continued occupation of parts of south 
Lebanon and western al-Biqa'. These actions will continue as 
long as there is an occupation. The only solution lies in 
Israel's commitment to implement Security Council Resolution 
425, which demands that it withdraw immediately from south 
Lebanon. Israel still refuses to comply with this resolution. 
  [Al-Miliji] From what you are saying, there appears to be 
coordination between the Lebanese Government and the national 
resistance in the south. Is that true? 
  [Makkawi] Every country has the right to resist occupation. 
Resistance is legitimate as long as there is occupation. This 
is not restricted to Lebanon. All countries in the world have 
fought occupation and colonialism. This is what the Lebanese 
people are doing. 
  [Al-Miliji] This raises the question about the security 
situation in Lebanon. Doesn't this Israeli operation and the 
ease with which it was done raise this question? 
  [Makkawi] Israel has gotten into the habit of undertaking 
such operations, not only in Lebanon but also in various parts 
of the world. I remind you of the Tunis operation in which a 
Palestinian official was killed. Israel is militarily developed 
and can carry out such operations regardless of the military 
situation in Lebanon. 
  [Al-Miliji] What does Lebanon plan to do in the next stage? 
  [Makkawi] The Security Council should ask Israel first to 
stop its aggression against Lebanon and second to release this 
Lebanese citizen immediately. These are Lebanon's main demands. 
  [Al-Miliji] Will this take the form of a resolution? 
  [Makkawi] We are holding contacts. I do not know yet what 
the Security Council's reaction will be. It might issue a 
resolution or a statement. How the Security Council will act is 
not clear yet.

  [Text] Beirut, June 2 (AFP) -- The Iranian-backed Hizballah 
vowed to fight the Jewish state "on all fronts" after Israeli 
warplanes killed at least 45 guerrillas in a devastating raid on 
Thursday. 
  "From now on the battle with Israel is open on all fronts," 
Hizballah spiritual leader, Shaykh Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah, 
said in a statement. 
  "It's the biggest challenge ever. Moslems, the mujahidin and 
the oppressed have decided there is no place for Israel among 
us. The forces of world oppression will no longer have a say in 
our region," Fadlallah said. 
  "Israel and the forces of world oppression can win several 
rounds but satans big or small trying to devour us will not 
frighten us," he added. 
  Fadlallah described the United States as a "wolf which 
devours man, peace and life." 
  "We know that every shell and every Israeli warplane is in 
fact an American shell and an American warplane," he said.

  [Excerpts] Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi Shams al-Din has affirmed 
that despite the occupation enemy's spiteful methods and 
aggression, the resistance will continue to forge ahead with its 
confrontation of the occupation. He urged those in charge of 
the international order to end the Israeli occupation of Lebanon. 
  Acting Mufti Shaykh Muhammad Rashid Qabbani has urged the 
Arabs and the world to put an end to the Jewish acts of 
belligerence, which will trigger further conflicts and a state 
of instability in this world. [passage omitted] 
  'Allamah Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah said: We decided that 
there is no place for Israel among us. The battle [against 
Israel] will be as wide as the world so that the usurpers will 
leave our land. 
  Fadlallah criticized the United States, describing it as the 
wolf that devours man, peace, and life. Fadlallah held the 
United States responsible for the Israeli attacks. 
  Hizballah Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah stressed the 
determination to continue struggle and jihad.

  [Text] Responsible security sources have told our 
correspondent that Hizballah fired rockets this afternoon, thus 
violating the understanding reached in the wake of Operation 
Accountability. The sources noted that the firing of rockets 
was preceded by an Israeli air raid against a Hizballah base in 
the Ba'labakk area, leaving 30 terrorists dead and 60 others 
wounded. 
  The sources said that the base was used for training 
Hizballah members. It was also used as a staging point for 
carrying out terrorist operations in south Lebanon. The air 
raid was effected as part of the continuous war against 
Hizballah and as a response to Hizballah's terrorist acts 
against the Israeli army, the South Lebanese Army [SLA], and 
civilians in the border area. 
  The sources stressed that the State of Israel cannot remain 
silent over rockets being fired at civilian targets. They added 
that if Hizballah fails to abide by the understanding, Israel 
will be absolved of this understanding. The sources added that 
if Hizballah continues to attack the Israeli army, the SLA, and 
the defenseless civilians in the border area, the Israeli army 
will use all available means to strike with all force at 
Hizballah. 
  The firing of rockets will be met with a violent response 
against Hizballah bases and centers as well as those belonging 
to the other terrorist organizations. If calm does not prevail 
on this side, it will also not prevail on the other side, the 
sources added.

  [Text] Beirut, June 3 (AFP) -- Tens of thousands of angry 
mourners took part in funeral ceremonies in Beirut and around 
Lebanon on Friday [3 June] for up to 45 Hizballah guerrillas 
killed in a devastating Israeli air raid. 
  Hizballah Secretary General Shaykh Hasan Nasrallah told an 
estimated 20,000 people in Beirut's Shiite Moslem southern 
suburbs: "The (anti-Israeli) Islamic Resistance has been born 
anew." Nasrallah, frequently interrupted by mourners chanting 
Islamic slogans and calling "Death to Israel" and "Death to the 
United States," vowed that the guerrillas were ready for a 
"Jihad (holy war) until victory." He called on Lebanon to pull 
out of Middle East peace talks with Israel, following Thursday's 
raid. "Giving peace and security to Israel is forbidden. We 
call on all the mujahidin (Islamic fighters) in the world and in 
occupied Palestine to consider this cause their own," he said. 
  Around 5,000 mourners also gathered in the Syrian-controlled 
town of Ba'labakk for the funeral of five fighters, while 1,500 
others paid their last respects to 13 guerrillas at a ceremony 
in the southern port of Sidon. 
  The coffins of 10 fighters and the portraits of two others 
were carried shoulder-high by mourners in the southern suburbs 
of Beirut. 
  In the southern port city of Sidon, marchers chanted in 
unison: "War, war until victory" and vowed to liberate Jerusalem 
from Israeli occupation. 
  Ahmad Manna', 60, the father of one of 13 Hizballah 
"martyrs" 
from south Lebanon, told AFP: "I still have seven sons and I 
will offer them for the sake of Allah and for liberating south 
Lebanon." 
  Shaykh Nabil Qa'uq, a Hizballah official, said Hizballah was 
determined to "strike Israel anywhere and at any time." 
  Lebanon has declared a national day of mourning and called 
for an urgent UN Security Council meeting, branding the Israeli 
raid a massacre and an attack on its sovereignty. Shops, 
schools and public offices were closed. Radio and television 
stations broadcast classical music or verses from the Koran, and 
the authorities ordered that flags be flown at half-mast. 
Airport traffic was also suspended for one hour. 
  The Iranian-backed group said 26 guerrillas were killed in 
the raid and 40 others wounded. But Lebanese Foreign Minister 
Faris Buwayz put the death toll at 45 while hospital officials 
in the al-Biqa' said 85 were wounded.

  [Text] Tyre, Lebanon, June 3 (AFP) -- A Hizballah 
guerrilla was killed and a Fijian peacekeeper wounded in a 
pre-dawn clash Friday in south Lebanon, the spokesman of the UN 
Interim Force in Lebanon [UNIFIL] said. 
  The fighting broke out when Hizballah guerrillas refused to 
have their vehicles searched for weapons at a Fijian checkpoint 
in the Tyre region near Israel's self-declared "security zone" 
in south Lebanon, Timor Goksel told reporters. Shooting broke 
out during which a Hizballah guerrilla was killed and a Fijian 
soldier wounded, he added. 
  Sporadic gunfire also targeted three other Fijian positions 
in the Tyre region but there were no casualties, the spokesman 
said. 
  Correspondents in south Lebanon also reported intense 
Israeli 
reconnaissance flights over the region overnight and until the 
early morning hours. 
  Heightened tension has gripped south Lebanon after 
Thursday's 
devastating Israeli air raid on a Hizballah training base in the 
Syrian-controlled al-Biqa' Valley, in eastern Lebanon, which 
prompted retaliatory rocketing of northern Israel. Israeli 
soldiers and their proxy South Lebanon Army (SLA) was on red 
alert in the security zone and residents of northern Israel 
spent the night in bomb shelters. The Lebanese army and 
anti-Israeli guerrillas in south Lebanon were also on alert. 
  The air raid on a tent camp near the Syrian border killed 26 
guerrillas and wounded 40 others, according to Hizballah. 
Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Bwwayz put the death toll at 45 
and hospitals officials in the Syrian-controlled eastern 
al-Biqa' Valley town of Ba'labakk said they were treating as 
many as 85 injured.

  [Text] A Hizballah information source has said that the 
incident that occurred with the UN Interim Force in Lebanon 
[UNIFIL] Fijian contingent in the al-Qulaylah area this morning 
came about because that contingent fired at a resistance group 
without warning. The incident left two resistance men injured, 
one of them seriously, and he died soon afterwards. 
  The source said that it was surprising that the UNIFIL force 
in the area was placed on alert afterwards and set up 
checkpoints and ambushes in a provocative way. They also fired 
at a Hizballah envoy who was going to the UNIFIL checkpoint in 
al-Tayyibah to discuss outstanding incidents. He was hit in the 
foot and received shrapnel wounds in his face. 
  Active contacts are under way to address the incident and 
its 
repercussions.

    [Editorial Report] Beirut AL-SAFIR in Arabic in its 21 May 
issue features a straightforward 250-word report on page 1 
citing REUTER, AFP, AP, and UPI on the resignation of U.S. 
Ambassador to Israel Edward Djerejian. The report says that 
Djerejian decided to resign because he was excluded by the State 
Department from the decisionmaking process in the Syrian-Israeli 
track of the peace negotiations. The report cites a university 
source in Washington as saying that Djerejian will resign to 
assume a new position at Rice University in Houston as director 
of the James A. Baker Institute for Public Policy. The report 
notes that a spokesman at the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv said that 
Djerejian is resigning for personal and family reasons. 
  Beirut AL-DIYAR in Arabic in its 23 May issue carries a 
300-word straightforward report on page 14 citing AFP. The 
report notes that the State Department has denied the Israeli 
newspapers' claims that Djerejian resigned because he was 
"excluded" from the peace process. 
  Beirut AL-NAHAR in Arabic in its 20 May issue carries a 
150-word straightforward report on page 1 citing REUTER as 
saying that Djerejian decided to leave his post after only six 
months to assume a post at Rice University. The report states 
that Djerejian may work as a political adviser to James Baker 
should Baker decide to run for president.

  [Text] The Arab League today declared its backing for the 
UN Security Council [UNSC] resolution that calls for an 
immediate cease-fire in Yemen, for solving inter-Yemeni disputes 
peacefully, and for restoring peace and stability in that 
country. 
  The League said that Yemeni unity, which represents national 
interests and pan-Arab achievements, must be preserved. It 
announced, however, that unity cannot be imposed by force. 
  The League issued a new appeal to the Yemeni parties to 
hasten to end the tragedy in their country, as the victims are 
none other than the sons of the fraternal Yemeni people.

  [Text] Tunis, 2 Jun (MENA) -- Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat has suffered a severe health setback that has forced him 
to stay home since yesterday and to halt his activities. 
Doctors decided to prevent him from receiving visitors because 
of his extreme exhaustion. 
  'Arafat felt exhausted after his return from visits to 
Algeria and Mauritania but he forced himself to receive a U.S. 
Senate delegation yesterday morning. After the delegation 
departed the PLO headquarters, 'Arafat went up to his private 
apartment on the second floor. Several Tunisian and Palestinian 
doctors were promptly summoned to 'Arafat's residence and he was 
given a physical examination plus several laboratory tests. 
  The doctors gave strict orders banning visits to 'Arafat and 
advised him to get total rest.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. 'Abd-al-Hafiz al-Ashhab, official in </F>
charge of the communications and post portfolio in the 
Palestinian Authority, by Sa'id Mu'addi on 2 June; place not 
given; from the "With the Events" program -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Mu'addi] Dr. 'Abd-al-Hafiz al-Ashhab, on your 
way back to the [self-rule] area from Tunis, you met in Jordan 
with Jordanian Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali. What 
took place at this meeting? 
  [Al-Ashhab] The meeting was a courtesy call in our capacity 
as the first [Palestinian] officials arriving in Amman after 
completing the formation of the Palestinian National Authority 
[PNA]. It was a get-acquainted call. We requested to his 
excellency the prime minister that each of the Palestinian 
officials meet with his counterpart in the Jordanian Government 
ministries. 
  The prime minister welcomed this idea, and gave directives 
for meetings with our counterparts in the Jordanian Government 
on the following day. And this, in fact, took place. I met 
with officials from the [Jordanian] Telecommunications 
Corporation and the Ministry of Communications. Likewise, my 
colleague Dr. 'Azmi al-Shu'aybi met with his counterpart the 
[Jordanian] minister of youth. Ilyas Frayj met with the 
minister of tourism. Dr. Zakariya al-Agha met with officials 
from the Ministry of Housing. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. 'Abd-al-Hafiz: What is the Jordanian attitude 
and position on extending aid to the PNA in various fields? 
  [Al-Ashhab] In fact, they expressed great hospitality, and 
said they are ready to extend all that we request. We have 
actually begun to coordinate with them. This is a natural 
matter because, as you know, Jordan used to have a presence here 
[in the occupied territories] before 1967. As an 
institutionalized state, Jordan has wide experience and room for 
coordination with us at the beginning of our work as a PNA. 
  We also agreed to exchange personnel for training, so that 
people from the West Bank will go to institutions in Amman to 
receive training in various fields. We also requested that 
experts be sent from Jordan to the West Bank, so that we can 
cooperate with them on establishing the new Palestinian 
Authority. 
  [Mu'addi] What urgent aid can Jordan extend to the 
Palestinians in this stage? 
  [Al-Ashhab] Jordan can extend aid in various fields. This 
is a new experience for the Palestinians and we need 
cooperation, coordination, and aid from our brothers in the East 
Bank. Naturally, they will not withhold from us anything we 
request in various fields. [passage omitted]

  [Text] New Delhi, June 2 (AFP) -- The Indian Army began the 
countdown Thursday for the first "user trial" of the home-built 
Prithvi surface-to-surface missile, whose possible deployment 
has aroused US concern, reports said here. 
  Prithvi, or Earth, which has a range of 250 kilometres (156 
miles), would be tested during the next 48 hours, the Press 
Trust of India (PTI) quoted unnamed defence sources here as 
saying. 
  A spokesman for the defence ministry here confirmed that 
preparations had begun for the trial, which was postponed from 
May 15 until Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's return from a 
visit to the United States. 
  "The test will be carried out provided all systems are found 
to be working well and there are no last-minute snags," the 
spokesman said. 
  Top army experts and defence scientists have reached the 
test 
site at Chandipur-on-Sea in the eastern coastal state of Orissa, 
PTI said. 
  The missile has been successfully tested several times by 
the 
Department of Defence Production, but it would be the first 
"user-trial" ahead of its possible mass-production for 
deployment in the army. 
  US Ambassador-Designate Frank Wisner has urged New Delhi to 
reconsider deploying the missile. 
  Washington has voiced fears that India's missile programme 
might lead to another arms race between India and arch rival 
Pakistan, with whom it has fought three wars since 1947.

  [Text] The latest security reports from the south say that 
areas in al-Nabatiyah al-Fawqa, the eastern hills of Kafr Rumman 
village, the outskirts of the abandoned Lebanese Army barracks 
in al-Nabatiyah, al-Wadi al-Akhdar, 'Ayn Bu Siwar, and Jarju' 
villages are coming under violent Israeli artillery bombardment 
from the occupation troops' posts in al-Zaffat. Citizen 'Imad 
'Abd-al-Hasan Hallal, who chanced to be driving by, was killed 
and two others riding in the same car were wounded. In the 
meantime, Israeli warplanes have conducted low altitude flights 
and carried out mock raids over al-Nabatiyah and Iqlim al-Tuffah 
areas. More in this dispatch from National News Agency's 
correspondent Muhammad Ruba'i: 
  [Begin recording] Tension reigns in the south, particularly 
in areas adjacent to the occupied border belt, and the 
resistance fighters are on the alert. Security sources have 
told us that at 1515 a rocket fell on the Yarin position in the 
central sector, where the occupation troops and their agents are 
posted. A number of personnel manning the position were 
injured. For its part, the enemy has placed its troops on alert 
in anticipation of any attack by the resistance fighters in 
response to its air raids. 
  We just received word that the enemy brought a number of 
vehicles and long-range guns into the positions and hills 
overlooking the central and Western sectors. Three 155-mm 
artillery shells have fallen on the outskirts of Kafra village, 
in the central sector, near the village school. Since 1630, 
enemy aircraft have been flying at low-altitude over the south.

  [Text] Nicosia, Jun 3 (CNA) -- Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) 
foreign ministers, who met in Cairo, expressed regret on Friday 
[3 June] that the recent UN efforts to clinch an agreement on a 
package of confidence building measures in Cyprus have ended in 
failure because the Turkish side lacked political will. 
  The ministers also urged the UN Security Council to consider 
alternative ways to promote the implementation of its 
resolutions on Cyprus and recalled the idea of holding an 
international conference on the problem. 
  Moreover they reiterated their support for the sovereignty, 
independence, territorial integrity, unity and non-aligned 
status of the Republic of Cyprus. 
  The final document, adopted by the conference, which ended 
on 
Friday in the Egyptian capital, expressed the ministers' "regret 
that the recent initiative for the implementation of a package 
of confidence building measures has failed because the Turkish 
side has not shown the necessary political will, as has been 
reflected in the report of the UN secretary-general, just 
published." 
  The UN-led talks on the measures, which included the 
re-opening of Nicosia International Airport under UN control and 
the delivery of part of the Turkish-occupied town of Varosha to 
UN administration, ended in failure this week, nearly a year 
after they started. 
  Calling for the intensification of efforts towards finding a 
just and viable solution to the Cyprus problem, the ministers 
"stressed the importance of securing compliance with all UN 
resolutions on Cyprus" and "urged the UN Security Council to act 
accordingly." 
  The four-day meeting called for "the withdrawal of foreign 
troops and settlers" from Cyprus. 
  Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops 
invaded and occupied the island's northern third. Turkey has 
repeatedly refused to comply with numerous UN resolutions 
calling for the withdrawal of its occupation forces. 
  The NAM document considered the present status quo in Cyprus 
as "unacceptable" and expressed "deep regret and disappointment 
that so far no solution had been found." 
  The ministers "welcomed the proposal by President of Cyprus 
Glavkos Kliridhis for the demilitarisation of the Republic of 
Cyprus." 
  The extract on Cyprus has been described as a "huge success" 
because it contains many positions on the Cyprus issue that go 
far beyond any previous NAM decisions, a statement issued here 
on Friday said. 
  Cyprus Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis led an 
eight-member delegation to the meeting, during which he had 
separate meeting with 30 NAM foreign ministers.

  [Text] Cairo, June 4 (YONHAP) -- Foreign ministers of 
nonaligned countries demanded Friday [3 June] that North Korea 
cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] in 
its efforts to carry out full inspections of the Yongbyon 
nuclear reactor, which the IAEA believes is the center of the 
North's suspected nuclear ambitions. 
  An official statement, adopted at the end of a four-day 
meeting here of foreign ministers from 85 nonaligned countries, 
stressed the need for a peaceful resolution of the issue through 
continuing dialogue and negotiations among relevant parties, 
particularly among the United States, the IAEA and North Korea. 
  North Korea had fiercely lobbied the delegates to the 11th 
conference of nonaligned foreign ministers to make no mention of 
the IAEA and the North Korean nuclear issue in the draft 
declaration, according to conference sources. 
  The conference, however, ignored these efforts in an 
apparent 
setback for North Korea in the Nonalignment Movement, they said. 
  A delegate from Singapore said it was impossible for the 
declaration not to mention the IAEA, adding that the Nonaligned 
Movement would have lost prestige in the international community 
had it not touched on the nuclear issue. 
  A substantial part of the 66-page declaration, meanwhile, 
was 
given over to emphasizing the need to change the direction of 
the Nonaligned Movement in the post-Cold War era. 
  In the declaration, the nonaligned countries pledged to 
strengthen cooperation among developing countries on the basis 
of mutual understanding and reliance and to pursue dialogue with 
the developed industrial world so as to promote international 
economic cooperation. 
  Criticizing the rich industrial countries for employing 
various forms of protectionism in international trade at a time 
when developing nations are trying to adopt open market 
policies, the declaration claimed the industrialized world has 
denied developing states access to advanced technology by 
blocking technology transfers, citing concerns over military 
applications. 
  Touching on regional conflicts, the declaration urged the 
immediate signing of a ceasefire between South and North Yemen, 
denounced the Israelis for their air raids on Lebanon Thursday 
and demanded that Iraq respect the sovereignty and borders of 
Kuwait. 
  The nonaligned foreign ministers decided to hold a 
nonaligned 
summit conference in Cartagena, Colombia, in September 1995.

  [Text] Cairo, 5 Jun (MENA) -- The Arab League General 
Secretariat has strongly denounced Israel's military operations 
against Lebanon, which killed and wounded many of the brotherly 
Lebanese people. 
  In a statement released today, the Arab League stressed that 
the continued Israeli buildup in southern Lebanon runs counter 
to Israel's claims that it seeks a durable, just, and 
comprehensive peace with the Arab countries and contravenes the 
rules of international law and the international resolutions, 
particularly Resolution 425, which calls for Israel's withdrawal 
from south Lebanon and the establishment of Lebanon's 
sovereignty over all its territories. 
  The statement stressed that Israel's continued hostile 
practices against the Arab people in the occupied Arab 
territories neither serve the peace process nor help build 
confidence, at a time when the region's peoples need to devote 
their attention to stability, security, and overall development. 
  The Arab League Secretariat called on the Security Council 
and the United States and Russia, the cosponsors of the Middle 
East peace process, to force Israel to immediately halt its 
military operations against south Lebanon and to put all 
possible pressure to compel Israel to implement Security Council 
Resolution 425, which calls for Israel's unconditional 
withdrawal from south Lebanon.

  [Text] The Arab League today condemned Israel's hostile 
military operations against Israel, which claimed the lives of 
scores of innocent civilians. Ambassador 'Adnan 'Imran, the 
Arab League's assistant secretary general for political affairs, 
has told our radio correspondent that Israel seeks from these 
hostile operations to obstruct the peace process on all tracks, 
particularly the Lebanese track. He added that Israel believes 
that striking at the Lebanese national resistance is a step in 
that direction. He stressed that national resistance is a 
legitimate right for the Lebanese that will not stop before 
Israel withdraws from every inch of the Lebanese occupied 
territories. 
  Ambassador 'Imran noted that the more Israeli aggressions 
against the Lebanese people there are, the more determined they 
will be to continue the struggle to expel Israel from south 
Lebanon, in implementation of UN Resolution 425, which the 
Security Council and the major states have thus far failed to 
implement.

  [Text] Jeddah, 5 Jun (SPA) -- The ICO Secretary General 
Hamid al-Ghabid expressed the ICO's deep concern over the recent 
Israeli attacks against southern Lebanon. 
  In a statement issued by the organization today, he said 
that 
these attacks, which were strong, barbaric, and do not respect 
human life, represent a blatant violation of international law; 
they provide further evidence on the motives of hegemony as 
practiced by Israel in its international relations. 
  Dr. al-Ghabid strongly condemned the air hostilities and the 
mobilization of land forces to launch more aggressive acts. He 
believes that the continuation of such barbaric acts could 
seriously hamper the peace process in the Middle East and would 
make it difficult to reach any satisfactory results. 
  He appealed to the UN Security Council to take into account 
these serious developments and called on the co-sponsors of the 
peace process to use their influence and exert maximum efforts 
to save the peace process.

    [Editorial report] The following review of the 27 May issue 
of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in nature. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Last Hours of Lawyer Madani 
  2. Interrogation of Brotherhood Leader Called Off 
  3. Editor Warns Government Not To Smother Liberties 
  4. Egyptian Sudanese War Feared 
  5. Al-Ghazali Sermon Banned 
  6. Mufti's Views on Jews, Palestine 
  7. Copts Not a Minority 
<H5>  LAST HOURS OF LAWYER MADANI </H5>
  The death of lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani while in police 
custody remains in the news and AL-SHA'B publishes on page 1 a 
500-word report on the last day of his life. Citing sources at 
Cairo's al-Qasr al-'Ayni Hospital, the paper says a police 
colonel brought a blindfolded man, unable to speak or move, to 
the hospital at dawn on 27 April, telling the intern on duty: 
"See if this kid is playing the fool or what is wrong with 
him." The intern discovered that the man's body was covered 
with bruises. 
  The report adds that the colonel refused to reveal the man's 
identity. He also would not allow the man's blindfold to be 
removed until he was seen by two resident physicians, one of 
whom suspected internal chest bleeding and wrote a note to this 
effect to the resident heart and chest surgeon. This note was 
disregarded and the patient was transferred to the detainees' 
ward where he died in the afternoon. 
  The report continues that when one of the resident doctors 
who had seen him in the morning reported for duty again in the 
afternoon, she was asked to write out a death certificate saying 
that the "unidentified" case who had been moved to the 
detainees' ward had died of an asthma attack. 
  AL-SHA'B says that Madani had never complained of asthma in 
his life. 
<H5>  INTERROGATION OF BROTHERHOOD LEADER CALLED OFF </H5>
  A brief item on page 1 reports that al-Jizah's public 
attorney, following a meeting with Muslim Brotherhood General 
Guide Hamid Abu-al-Nasr's lawyer Sayf-al-Islam Hasan al-Banna, 
rescinded his earlier order to summon the general guide for 
interrogation. Abu-al-Nasr had been sought for interrogation in 
connection with the distribution of a leaflet carrying his 
signature shortly before the 'Id al-Adha Muslim feast. He had 
committed a technical illegality by signing the leaflet as the 
Muslim Brotherhood general guide. The Muslim Brotherhood is not 
formally recognized by the government as a legal movement. 
<H5>  EDITOR WARNS GOVERNMENT NOT TO SMOTHER LIBERTIES </H5>
  Chief editor Majdi Ahmad Husayn discusses in a 2,500-word 
editorial on pages 1 and 2 the "official media's campaign 
against the Muslim Brotherhood" following the government's 
"dismal failure" in dealing with the Lawyers Association and its 
legally elected Council. 
  He says: "The government is creating a climate suggesting 
that it is time to pounce on the moderate Islamic stream by 
means of a media campaign that uses all methods except the 
truth. The claim is being emphatically made that the Muslim 
Brotherhood is part and parcel of the terrorist movement, 
although all those who write about this issue, relying on 
security reports, know in their hearts that this is not true." 
  Husayn warns the government not to encroach on the already 
narrow margin of liberties and says its vicious campaigns will 
merely serve to isolate it further from the citizens. He cites 
the government's decision to ban Islamic preacher Shaykh 
Muhammad al-Ghazali from delivering a sermon on 'Id al-Adha, its 
arrest of Socialist Labor Party young members without specific 
charges, its hostile attitude to the Lawyers Association, and 
its contempt for journalists like himself. He declares: "You 
are ridiculing us and telling yourselves that this newspaper has 
been clamoring for months and years while we enjoy the seats of 
power. You say: Let them clamor while we rule. We can silence 
them at any time." 
  Husayn continues: "I tell you that the sense of the passage 
of time is a relative matter. When the day of which we warn you 
finally comes, you will regret but it will be too late." 
<H5>  EGYPTIAN-SUDANESE WAR FEARED </H5>
  A 400-word article in the "Topic of the Hour" column on page 
7 by Tal'at Rumayh warns of a possible Egyptian-Sudanese war 
over Hala'ib or over the Egyptian buildings and other 
installations that the Sudanese authorities periodically take 
over. He says he suspects that the "United States and Israel 
have a magical recipe to strike a decisive blow against Egypt's 
current and future role in the Arab world and to abort the 
Sudanese experiment at the same time." 

<H5>    AL-GHAZALI SERMON BANNED </H5>
  A detailed report of 2,000 words on page 3 speaks of the 
government's "recent provocative acts against the Islamic 
stream" including the tight security measures in various places 
of worship during the 'Id al-Adha Muslim feast and the banning 
of well-known Muslim preacher Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali from 
leading the 'Id al-Adha prayers and delivering a sermon in the 
square of the Mustafa Mahmud Mosque in Cairo's al-Muhandisin 
District. The government sent an Awqaf Ministry preacher to 
lead the worshipers in prayer. 
  The report describes the security measures around various 
mosques during the feast's religious observances and says the 
security forces tried to prevent worshipers from forming large 
crowds in village squares or in open areas before the mosques. 
There are references to the substance of the sermons made by 
various imams in various parts of the country. Shaykh 
'Abd-al-Mu'izz 'Abd-al-Sattar, a prayer leader in Hulwan 
advocated the application of Islamic shari'ah and the nation's 
return to Islam. Members of East Hulwan's Youth Center 
distributed a leaflet which said, in part: "This is the current 
condition of the Islamic nation and Palestine is being sold." 
  A 700-word commentary next to the above report is entitled: 
"The Accredited Preacher and the State-Owned Prayer Rug." The 
writer, AL-SHA'B journalist Khalid Yusuf, who was under police 
custody during the 'Id al-Adha observances, describes how he was 
allowed to worship surrounded by police officers, many of them 
plainclothes security personnel, and how he overheard them 
saying that the imam who was going to deliver the sermon was 
"the accredited speaker," meaning a preacher considered safe by 
the authorities. 
<H5>  MUFTI'S VIEWS ON JEWS, PALESTINE </H5>
  In the newspaper's "Dialogue" section on page 9, Dr. Mahmud 
Himayah, an al-Azhar academic, writes a 4,500 article which 
appears to be a book review of an unnamed book by Mufti of the 
Republic Dr. Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi. Himayah does not say he 
is reviewing a book but the headline of the article reads: "The 
mufti said: The Zionists Are People of Treachery, Espionage, 
and Corruption." In his introductory paragraph, Himayah again 
says "in the mufti's words" and halfway through the article this 
sentence appears: "Toward the End of the Book the Mufti Wonders: 
What Are the Main Reasons for the Palestinian Catastrophe?" 
  A two-column photograph of the mufti accompanies the 
article. 
  The apparent review outlines the mufti's views, based on 
Koranic verses, on the Jews's "killing of prophets" and their 
espousement of espionage methods to "promote their interests and 
work corruption on the earth". 
  The review then discusses the conversion of some Jews to 
other religions with the aim of promoting Jewish and Israeli 
interests. Dr. Ahmad Shalabi is quoted as saying that in several 
Far Eastern countries there are Buddhists of Jewish origin or 
Buddhists married to Jewish women who work in their countries' 
embassies in Indonesia and rather than serve those countries' 
interests, they are always seeking to promote the Israeli cause. 
  Part of the review is devoted to 19th century British Prime 
Minister Disraeli who is said to have converted to Christianity 
to help Jewish causes, including emigration to Palestine. He is 
also blamed for "stealing" Egypt's share of the newly built Suez 
Canal in the late 19th century by purchasing that share for a 
mere 4 million pounds from Khedive Isma'il. 
  There is a section about the "evils and sins" that the Jews 
are encouraged to perpetrate by their scriptures and other 
books. In this connection the "Protocols of the Elders of Zion" 
are mentioned and the first, second, third, eleventh, and 
seventeenth "protocols" are cited. These are said to refer 
respectively to the clash between morality and politics, the 
power of the press, the benefits of the diaspora in enabling the 
Jews to "attain world dominance," and the need to undermine 
clerics of other religions. 
  The Jews are accused of "seeking to undermine religions, 
morals, and spiritual values" and using the media, including the 
cinema and theatre, to disseminate "debauchery and moral 
dissolution among individuals, communities, and nations." 
  Concerning the Palestinian issue, the mufti is cited as 
saying that the efforts of world Jewry to Judaize Palestine, the 
feeble religious sentiment among the Arabs, and Arab disunity 
were behind the loss of Palestine. He criticizes the fact that 
the defenders of Palestine at the time of Israel's establishment 
were motivated by nationalist, political sentiments alone to the 
exclusion of religious feeling. He stresses the need to 
correct this attitude and to keep the memory of Palestine alive 
until the time comes for its liberation. 
  As noted above, the name of the mufti's book is not given. 
Nor is there any indication of when the book was published. 

<H5>    COPTS NOT A MINORITY </H5>
  Also on page 9, Ibrahim al-Bayyumi Ghanim discusses in a 
3,000-word article entitled: "The Conference on Minorities and 
the Policy of Division" the status of Egypt's Coptic community. 
He refers to the attempts of foreign powers to use the minority 
issue to "serve their ambitions and promote their objectives in 
some of our countries where some minorities live, this being a 
well-known and long-established policy of Western and U.S. 
colonialism." 
  The article recalls the controversy surrounding the plan by 
Cairo's Ibn-Khaldun Center and the London-based Minority Rights 
Group to hold a conference on minorities in Cairo and issue a 
declaration called "The Cairo Declaration on Minority Rights." 
The controversy forced the organizers to change the meeting's 
venue from Cairo to Cyprus. 
  The writer points out that "the issue of minorities is an 
extremely sensitive issue and one of the most controversial 
worldwide." He adds that "foreign colonial and Zionist powers 
seek by actual intervention to foster ethnic and religious 
conflicts with the aim of turning these groups into new 
statelets and warring factions that will be easy to swallow." 
  He expresses reservations about the UN declaration of 18 
December 1992 about the rights of "individuals belonging to 
national, ethnic, and linguistic minorities" and says it cannot 
serve as a reference for handling minority issues in "our Arab 
and Islamic societies." 
  The writer denies that the Copts are a minority in Egypt and 
recalls how they were removed from the agenda of the conference 
in question following the uproar that surrounded their original 
inclusion in it. He writes: "They are not an ethnic minority 
or the descendants of a different national group. Actually the 
Muslims of Egypt are the descendants of the Copts of the 
pre-Islamic era. The Copts have no special language or culture 
that would isolate them from others but are a basic component of 
Egypt's social and cultural fabric." 
  He asserts that an Islamic system joins Muslims and the 
adherents of other religions in a united homeland and in a 
framework of common interests and emphasizes that an Islamic 
society always guarantees freedom of worship for non-Muslims. 
  He remarks: "The relationship between Egypt's Muslims and 
Copts was not disturbed until foreign colonialism entered our 
land. Nowadays a vicious foreign element or a disloyal domestic 
element is sowing suspicion among the sons of the same homeland 
and provoking disputes among them, thus serving the interests of 
colonialism and Zionism." 
  He continues: "It is our view that if the minority concept 
prevails in any society, it will have unlimited destructive 
repercussions that will eventually waste the united majority and 
lead to its dissolution. This can only be followed by its 
disappearance and assimilation into greedy foreign entities that 
seek to dominate us and control the whole world." 
  He ends the article by calling for the inclusion of all 
citizens in a free discussion of national issues.

  [Excerpts] President Idriss Deby of Chad and accompanying 
delegation arrived in Tripoli this evening on a visit to the 
Great Jamahiriyah. 
  President Deby was welcomed on arrival in Tripoli by Colonel 
Abu Bakr Yunus Jabir, some members of the secretariat of the 
General People's Congress, and the secretary and members of the 
General People's Committee. [passage omitted] 
  After his arrival, President Idriss Deby made a statement to 
JANA in which he said: I am extremely happy at being here today 
on the soil of the Great Jamahiriyah, the friendly country with 
which we share several common elements, including our history, 
blood, and culture. I am visiting the Great Jamahiriyah to 
discuss, strengthen and bolster our relations, and to look for 
further ways to promote fruitful and useful cooperation. 
  I would like, in the name of Chad, to thank the Libyan 
people 
and its leadership for the courage and understanding they have 
shown regarding the implementation of the International Court of 
Justice's resolution [on the Aouzou Strip], an element which 
could not be neglected. We believe that it is now time to open 
a new era of cooperation. My visit comes within this framework.

  [Excerpts] The brother leader of the revolution [Mu'ammar 
al-Qadhdhafi] and President Idriss Deby of Chad this morning 
attended the opening session of the Arab Libyan-Chadian talks to 
boost and promote bilateral relations. [passage omitted] 
  The brother leader of the revolution made an address in 
which 
he said: 
  [Begin Al-Qadhdhafi recording] In the name of God. We 
welcome our dear brother President Idriss Deby, and the 
high-level delegation accompanying him. We thank him for paying 
this visit. They are at home, among their brethren. Their visit 
at this time is considered as standing on the side of their 
brother the Libyan people in this confrontation [as heard], and 
their presence among us lifts the morale of their Libyan 
brothers. We are meeting now that all the problems that were 
pending between the two countries are finished. This was 
realized with the victory of fraternal will. The Libyan people 
sacrified a great deal in order to help their brother the 
Chadian people in a long battle in which victory was won by the 
Chadian people, a victory which is also considered as a victory 
of the Libyan people at this hour. Now we can cooperate hand in 
hand for construction and edification, and in order to 
consolidate brotherhood between the two fraternal peoples. In 
fact, the Libyan people and the Chadian people are of the same 
origin. [passage omitted] 
  We are happy with this meeting today, and in accordance with 
our common wish we are founding the basis for a joint strategic 
action for the good of the two peoples. The two countries have 
considerable potentials which, if integrated and exploited in a 
common program, will greatly benefit the two peoples. Those who 
consider Chad as being poor are mistaken. Chad has a basic 
capital: It is rich in raw materials, most important of which is 
water. Libya has known potentials, and each country needs the 
other. Each country has its own important possibilities. With 
fraternal spirit and revolutionary will we can integrate these 
resources and exploit them for the good of the two peoples. 
[passage omitted] [end recording] 
  President Idriss Deby then made a speech in which he said: 
  [Begin Deby recording, in French, followed by Arabic 
translation; translated from the French] Brother leader of the 
Libyan revolution; on behalf of the delegation accompanying me I 
thank you very sincerely, yourself and your government, for the 
very warm and fratern welcome accorded us. On the same 
occasion, and as I said yesterday during our meeting, I have 
come here at the head of a very important delegation consisting 
of members of the government, the pariament and political 
parties in order to salute the courage of the leader of the 
Libyan revolution, the Libyan people and its goverment for 
having done their utmost in resolving the problem which for more 
than two decades constituted a major handicap in our relations. 
[passage omitted] We can say that a new era of cooperation 
opens today between our two peoples. You mentioned that the 
Libyan people shed its blood for the Chadian people and the 
Chadian people shed its blood for the Libyan people. They are 
two peoples that have many things in common, and the time has 
come for us to make of our space a space of fruitful 
cooperation, a space for peace, a space for development for the 
benefit of our two peoples, who have much in common, as I said. 
  Brother leader of the revolution; your role and that of 
Libya 
in the development of Chad is very important. We consider that 
your brothers in Chad, in this precise framework, need unlimited 
support to enable them to resolve their problems and the 
difficulties they often face. We believe that this visit is a 
first of its kind, which in our view will permit the laying down 
of the foundation stone of peace, friendships and cooperation. 
This will also enable commissions to meet to examine all the 
possibilities of cooperation between our two countries, without 
limits. 
  Brother leader of the Libyan revolution; be assured that the 
Chadian people support the Libyan people in their difficulties, 
in their problems. The Libyan people will not betray this 
position of principle, a global, African and Arab position of 
principle. Thank you. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Remarks by Libyan leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi at ceremony </F>
presenting award to Chadian President Idriss Deby in Tripoli on 
4 June] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Since when has France defended 
freedom in Africa? France is a mortal enemy to the African 
peoples. It is the power that colonized and destroyed it, 
exploited its wealth, and despised its people. It is still 
spreading its domination over Africa by military force, and has 
not recognized the independence of the African states, including 
Chad. It considers them its colonies and works toward creating 
an international status before the United States and in Europe 
via its domination of the African continent. It has created for 
that purpose the traditional annual Francophone summit. This 
imperialist policy is exposed and condemned by the African 
peoples. What justification does France have to keep its forces 
in Chad after the end of the border dispute between Libya and 
Chad? It used to claim that there was an occupied Chadian 
territory and that there was a border dispute to keep its 
military forces to defend Chad. What will France say after this 
dispute comes to an end? How will it justify its presence in 
Chad after today? Certainly, there is no justification, except 
that it wants to occupy Chadian territory and wants Chad to 
remain its colony; otherwise it should go back to where it came 
from. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Text" of joint Libyan-Chadian communique, issued in </F>
Tripoli on 5 June] 
  [Text] At an invitation of Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, 
brother leader of the Great al-Fatih revolution, and in the 
framework of the relations of fraternity and friendship linking 
the Republic of Chad and the Great Socialist People's Libyan 
Arab Jamahiriyah [GSPLAJ], Colonel Idriss Deby, president of the 
Republic of Chad, paid a working and friendly visit to the 
GSPLAJ at the head of an important delegation from 3-5 June 
1994. The great guest and the delegation accompanying him 
enjoyed a popular and official welcome, which expressed the 
depth of the relations linking the two fraternal peoples. 
  Very important bilateral talks took place between the 
brother 
leader of the revolution and President Idriss Deby, at which 
prevailed an atmosphere of friendship and common understanding 
and which covered a number of issues at the bilateral, African, 
and international levels. 
  The brother leader of the revolution briefed his great guest 
on the achievements of the Great al-Fatih Revolution in the 
political, economic, cultural, and social fields. He informed 
him also of the intellectual and practical foundations of 
people's authority, which enabled the Libyan Arab people to 
practise their authority through their people's congresses and 
committees without having anybody to act on their behalf or 
represent them. 
  President Deby informed his brother, the leader of the 
revolution, of the political and economic program of the Chadian 
Government and its efforts in the field of economic and social 
development in a way that consolidates stability and security 
for the Chadian people. In the field of bilateral relations, 
the two sides expressed their satisfaction with the continuous 
development of their strong relations and fruitful cooperation 
and stressed the need to adopt the necessary measures to 
consolidate the bilateral relations in all fields and achieve 
economic and social cooperation between the two countries. The 
two sides stressed the need to find the suitable mechanisms to 
guarantee the follow-up and implementation of all the agreements 
and minutes of meetings through the joint committee and ensure a 
permanent supervision by the leaderships of the two countries, 
within the framework of direct contacts and consultations. 
  During the visit, a treaty of friendship and cooperation, 
which consolidates the relations between the two fraternal 
countries, was signed. 
  The Chadian side was informed of the Lockerbie issue and the 
mandatory sanctions imposed on the Libyan Arab people and the 
negative effects on the human and economic levels that have 
affected the Libyan Arab people and the neighboring states, 
including the Republic of Chad. The Chadian side expressed its 
solidarity with the Libyan Arab people against these unjust 
measures and expressed support for Arab, African, and 
international efforts to find an urgent and just solution to 
this question, which concerns the region as a whole, through 
direct dialogue in a way that protects security and peace in the 
region. In this context, the two sides expressed their regret 
for the way the UN Security Council deals with this issue and 
expressed their anxiety about the intervention policy applied to 
small states. 
  On the African level, the two sides welcome the political 
transformations in South Africa and its joining the OAU. They 
express their annoyance at the continuation of armed conflicts 
in various parts of the continent and the destruction they leave 
behind both in human and material levels. The two sides 
stressed the need for the OAU to find the efficient solutions to 
the problems of the continent and stressed the importance of 
Arab-African cooperation in general and the development of 
cooperation between the Arab Maghreb states and the states of 
Central and West Africa in particular. They stressed the 
importance of consultations between the states of the African 
Sahel and the GSPLAJ. 
  They stress that the debt issue is heavy on most African 
states and that the exemplary solution to this question lies in 
the control by African states of their natural resources and 
wealth and the setting up of an equitable economic order that 
secures and helps stability and development in African states. 
  At the end of the visit, Chadian President Idriss Deby 
expressed his great thanks and appreciation to the brother 
Colonle Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, the leader of the Great al-Fatih 
Revolution, and to the Libyan Arab people for the generous 
hospitality and warm fraternal welcome devoted to him and the 
delegation accompanying him. 
  His Excellency President Idriss Deby extended an invitation 
to the brother Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, the leader of the 
Great al-Fatih Revolution, to visit the Republic of Chad, which 
he accepted with gratitude. Its date will be fixed later.

  [Excerpts] Beirut, 3 Jun (JANA) -- The Israeli enemy has 
perpetrated an abominable massacre in the heart of Lebanese 
territory against Lebanese nationals, which left 45 dead and 
over 70 others injured. This attack, which targeted densely 
populated areas, showed total disregard for international 
conventions and charters. 
  Israeli war planes yesterday launched air raids on several 
villages and towns north of Ba'labak, and these raids also 
caused extensive damage to property. Press reports indicate 
that the Israeli planes dropped large quantities of bombs and 
tried to land but were prevented from doing so by the Lebanese 
antiaircraft defense on the ground. [passage omitted] 
  A source at the General People's Committee for Unity stated 
last week that the Israeli enemy is continuing its aggression 
against the Arab nation and is violating its sovereignty and 
territory with its military arsenal and weapons of destruction 
supplied by the West, mainly the U.S. Government, in a blatant 
defiance of all international resolutions. Moreover, their 
conspiratorial acts are stepped up whenever they want to impose 
further capitulation on the Arab regimes against the will of the 
masses, which reject defeat and surrender. 
  The violations and the aggression taking place today against 
Lebanon's sovereignty and its Arab people must be an incentive 
for frustrating all attempts of capitulation and attempts to 
impose the fait accompli. It must also be an incentive for 
confronting this act of aggression with the responsibility 
required by the Arab charters, foremost the Joint Arab Defense 
Treaty, so that Lebanon is no longer a daily target for the 
aggression of the Israelis and their savage raids, whose aim is 
to attack civilians and break the strong spirit of resistance to 
the Israeli enemy and to the occupation. 
  Proceeding from the constants of the great 1 September 
revolution and in accordance with the resolutions adopted by the 
Basic People's Congresses, which stressed the need to confront 
the continuous imperialist-backed Israeli aggression against the 
Arab nation, the General People's Committee for Unity in the 
Great Jamahiriyah condemns Israel's terrorism, which is 
manifested in its continued occupation of Arab territories, from 
southern Lebanon to the Golan Heights and in the Umm Rashrash 
[Elat] area. It also condemns its practice of aggression and 
its kidnapping of civilians, which nobody tries to prevent the 
Israeli entity from following. We also call for the 
implementation of the Arab charters and treaties to confront 
this situation.

  [Text] Tripoli, 5 June -- Sister A'ishah Mu'ammar 
al-Qadhdhafi yesterday afternoon received Mrs. Queenie Fletcher, 
the mother of British policewoman Yvonne Fletcher who was 
accidentally killed in front of the Arab People's Bureau in 
London 10 years ago. The British authorities wanted to accuse 
the Libyan Arab side before any impartial joint investigation, 
which the Great Jamahiriyah was very keen on, provided that it 
would include all the parties involved in the clashes, whether 
those who were attacking, those in a position of defense, and 
those who were present [words indistinct] their presence in the 
area was merely coincidental. 
  Sister A'ishah expressed her sympathy to Mrs. Fletcher on 
the 
loss of her daughter and Mrs. Fletcher in turn expressed her 
sympathy on the loss of the Qadhdhafi family's daughter, Hana'. 
  Sister A'ishah saluted the brave step taken by Mrs. Fletcher 
by coming to the Great Jamahiriyah to acquaint herself with the 
civilizational project of the Arab Libyan people and see for 
herself the consequences of the aggression and the consequences 
of the unfair measures imposed by Western countries on the Great 
Jamahiriyah through the so-called Security Council. 
  Mrs. Fletcher rejected that the regrettable incident which 
led to the death of her daughter Yevoun be exploited in harming 
the Libyan Arab people and its relations with British people. 
  Sister A'ishah Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi has extended an open 
invitation to Mrs. Fletcher to visit the Great Jamahiriyah which 
would remember her, as well as history between the two countries 
would, that her initiative had closed the road before whoever 
intends to harm the relations between the two peoples and had 
opened the way for establishing good relations between them. 
  It is worth mentioning that sister A'ishah Mu'ammar 
al-Qadhdhafi had informed Mrs. Fletcher that she could assume 
that she has a daughter in Great Jamahiriyah fully prepared to 
cooperate with her to turn the names of "Yevon" and "Hana'" into 
a symbol of and a testimony on the end of the era of brute force 
and the prevalence of the era of law, justice, and right and on 
the extension of bridges of amity, love, and peace. 
  Mrs. Fletcher had left Great Jamahiriyah following a 
five-day 
visit.

<F P=106> [Statement from the Presidential Office in Heliopolis, Cairo </F>
on 6 June -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] The Arab Republic of Egypt looks with deep concern 
and sorrow at the serious escalation of military operations in 
sister Yemen over the past few days; the escalation that has 
expanded the scope of war and intensified its repercussions and 
negative reflections. The situation is no longer restricted to 
bloodshed and the annihilation of lives; destruction has now 
extended to economic institutions and oil foundations. This 
involves dire risks that undermine the interests of the Yemeni 
people, both in the north and south, and further complicates the 
regional situation. 
  It is strange that this regrettable escalation should occur 
in spite of the numerous assurances Egypt has received from the 
Yemeni leadership, which pledged not to touch the oil 
foundations or economic institutions. These institutions belong 
to the Yemeni people and are crucial to secure their livelihood 
and develop their present and future resources. Accordingly, no 
one has the right to tamper with them or use them as a 
bargaining chip or instrument to put pressure. 
  Egypt regrets the continued and intensified bloodshed in 
spite of the Arab League appeals, the efforts it exerted, and 
the issuance of UN Security Council Resolution 924 which calls 
for an immediate cease-fire. 
  Appealing to officials in sister Yemen to avert further 
deterioration and to sincerely comply with the resolutions of 
the Arab household and the international legitimacy, Egypt 
denounces any action that would lead to the continuation or 
escalation of warfare.

  [Text] Cairo, 5 Jun (MENA)--Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, head 
of the government that has been announced recently in Aden, 
arrived in Cairo this afternoon from Jeddah on a short visit to 
Egypt. Al-'Attas' visit to Cairo is part of a tour he is making 
of a number of Arab countries. 
  In an arrival statement, al-'Attas said that his visit is 
part of the consultations with Egypt over the ongoing war in 
Yemen following the Security Council's resolution in this 
regard. He added: Sanaa is continuing the war and we are 
continuing our consultations with the officials in Egypt, the 
fraternal Arab countries, and the international community to 
adopt the necessary measures to end this war and begin 
negotiations and dialogue between the Yemeni north and the south 
to tackle the various aspects of the situation. He added: We 
are in need of medical supplies and medicines, because many 
people are sick and wounded. He noted that many of those are 
receiving treatment in hospitals in Egypt and other sister 
countries. 
  Asked about the continued fighting in Yemen, al-'Attas said 
that the Democratic Republic of Yemen has declared its clear-cut 
and explicit commitment to the Security Council resolution, but 
Sanaa, unfortunately, is still procrastinating in this matter, 
has not made a clear or definite decision, and in the past few 
days launched attacks against vital installations, oil 
refineries, and electricity facilities. He pointed out that 
these inhumane actions will destroy Yemen's infrastructure. 
Al-'Attas concluded his remarks by saying that he made certain 
today that both Iraq and Jordan are supplying Sanaa with weapons 
and spare parts, as he put it.

  [Text] Cairo, June 5 (AFP) -- Egyptian police have detained 
10 leaders of the outlawed Moslem Brotherhood and plan to hold 
them for 15 days for questioning, Interior Minister Hasan 
al-Alfi said Sunday. 
  He told the semi-official newspaper AL-AHRAM the men were 
rounded up "a few days ago" on charges of hampering the 
execution of court rulings. He refused to identify the men and 
did not specify the charges. 
  Although the Moslem Brotherhood was banned in 1954, it has 
been largely tolerated by the Egyptian government because of its 
non- violent stance. 
  Some of its members have in the past joined the parliament 
in 
coalition with other parties. 
  But the government has lost patience with the group after it 
took part in rallies last month protesting the death of lawyer 
'Abd-al-Harith Madani, who died while in police custody. 
  Four members were also arrested last month for allegedly 
distributing anti-government leaflets. Brotherhood leader Hamid 
Abu-al-Nasr was questioned on Sunday on the same charges, after 
answering a summons. 
  Moslem militants have been waging a two-year campaign to 
topple the government of President Husni Mubarak in which close 
to 400 people have been killed.

delivery of weapons contracted prior to the outbreak of the 
conflict in Rwanda, the source added. 
  The source made this statement to comment on reports 
broadcast by the Rwandan Front's radio that Egypt has recently 
sold 33 tons of weapons worth $765,000 to the Government of 
Rwanda. The responsible source concluded his comment by saying 
that what has been delivered under earlier contracts preceded 
the outbreak of the conflict and was part a commercial deal 
concluded with Rwanda, similar what has been done with other 
countries. The implementation of the remainder of the contract 
was suspended immediately after the outbreak of the internal 
conflict in Rwanda. The source added that Egypt is eager to 
stop the bloodshed in Rwanda and halt anything that may subject 
the Rwandan people to further destruction.

  [Text] Armed Forces Spokesman Brigadier General Muhammad 
Bashir has stated that the rebel movement is totally contained, 
following the liberation of the regions of (Moryo), west of Bahr 
al-Jabal, and Pageri, east of Bahr al-Jabal, in southern Sudan, 
by the Sudanese Armed Forces. Brig. Gen. Bashir indicated in a 
statement, published in the 3 June edition of AL-INQADH 
AL-WATANI in Khartoum, that the town of Pageri was strategically 
important, and that it was rebel Garang's main miltiary 
stronghold. 
  He stressed the Armed Forces' commitment to the state policy 
of making efforts to transport supplies to war victims. On this 
subject he dismissed information spread by foreign news 
organizations, that the Armed Forces were hindering the work of 
organizations operating in the relief sector. He said that the 
Sudanese Armed Forces remained committed to the relief provision 
agreement for those affected in southern Sudan.

  [Text] Dr. Muhammad Ahmad al-Aghbashi, the general 
commissioner for relief and rehabilitation, has reported that a 
relief column was attacked and plundered last week by the 
scattered remnants of the rebellion's army, while on its journey 
from Babanusah to Wau. The relief column was carrying 1,500 
tonnes of food, destined for distribution in areas affected by 
the war. 
  Dr. al-Aghbash condemned this attack, which constitutes a 
violation of agreements pertaining to the transportation of 
relief supplies, which guarantees safety for relief convoys, as 
signed by the government and the rebels under the auspices of 
the United Nations and the Intergovernmental Agency on Drought 
and Development [IGADD] states. 
  The United Nations, which supervises Operation Lifeline's 
activities in providing relief to the south, has presented a 
formal protest to the rebel movement in Nairobi regarding this 
attack, considering it to be a violation of the agreements on 
relief. 
  It may be recalled that the last agreement in this regard 
was 
signed on 17 May under the auspices of the IGADD committee, 
under which the number of relief areas was increased from 21 to 
84.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, member of the </F>
Palestinian National Authority, in Cairo, by Sa'id Mu'addi in 
the studio on 5 June; from the the "With the Midday Events" 
feature -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, good afternoon. 
  [Sha'th] Good afternoon, you are welcome. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, do you agree that the 
Israeli-Palestinian agreement will be in danger if the PNA 
[Palestinian National Authority] does not receive the funds 
promised by the donor states? 
  [Sha'th] True, peace is in danger. This is because the issue 
is not one of violation of the agreement. I do not think that 
there is anyone who wants to violate the agreement. What counts 
is the implementation of the agreement, and the implementation 
of the agreement needs invigoratation and speed. These donor 
states, which paid billions of dollars in the past to finance 
wars and to finance the Camp David Accord, should now pay some 
tens of dollars to enable the PNA to begin its work in Gaza and 
Jericho. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr., in your opinion, what is the reason for the 
delay in the financial aid? Has the PLO fulfilled its 
commitments toward these states? 
  [Sha'th] The truth is that the PLO has established two 
institutions, an institution to support the Palestinian police, 
and I chair this institution; and the other institution is to 
receive financial aid for administration and economic 
development, which is chaired by brother Abu-al-Lutf, Faruq 
Qaddumi, and it has an office in Jerusalem and another in Gaza. 
There are Dr. Hasan Abu-Libdah, Dr. Nabil Qassis, and others, 
and there is an integrated technical crew for this 
administration. I do not believe that the issue is due to some 
fundamental or institutional reasons, but to delay in the 
arrival of funds from donor states. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, opposition here in the West Bank and 
Gaza ask: Where are the PLO's funds? 
  [Sha'th] There are no funds in the PLO. The PLO has spent 
almost four years, in fact, four years and two months, receiving 
no aid from anyone. I believe that these four years, in terms 
of expenditures, inside and outside [the occupied territories] 
and millions of dollars which have been paid to the families of 
martyrs, detainees, the wounded, the disabled, and the 
Palestinian institutions inside and outside, have exhausted all 
the PLO's funds. 
  [Mu'addi] In a television interview, Yasir 'Arafat said that 
he will not go to Jericho because donor countries have not yet 
sent funds. Is this a warning, or an attempt to pressure these 
states? 
  [Sha'th] Brother President Yasir 'Arafat's complaint is 
justified and reasonable. We have not yet become a full-fledged 
independent state that has all rights and duties so that we can 
immediately do what other independent states do, in terms of 
sovereign actions, to print banknotes in its central bank or to 
get loans from its commercial banks. We do not have these 
powers yet. Therefore, in order to begin the implementation of 
an international agreement that all these states have signed, 
these states must fulfill their commitments, including Israel 
which should pay its dues to employees at the pension fund and 
other dues. Before we can begin levying new taxes, there are 
dues with the Israeli authorities, and other dues agreed with 
the donor states of which we have not yet obtained anything. 
So, President 'Arafat's complaint is justified and legal. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, are new PNA members going to arrive in 
the self-rule areas in Gaza and Jericho? 
  [Sha'th] Yes. This is in addition to the PNA members who are 
already there such as brothers Zakariya al-Agha, Frayh 
Abu-Middayn, Riyad al-Za'nun, Sa'ib 'Urayqat, Faysal al-Husayni, 
Ilyas Frayj, and 'Abd-al-'Aziz Hajj Ahmad, who are already 
inside. God willing, we will all join them. 
  [Mu'addi] When will Dr. Nabil Sha'th, Ahmad Quray', 
Abu-'Ala', and Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi arrive in the 
self-rule areas? 
  [Sha'th] During this week, God willing. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr., one final question, concerning the group 
which 
arrived, maybe in Cairo, and left for Gaza, who does this group 
include? 
  [Sha'th] It includes some personnel who were stationed in 
Tunis. They are all from among the approved names which 
constitute the remaining part of the Palestinian police. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, PNA member, thank you very much. 
  [Sha'th] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Faysal al-Husayni, chairman of the </F>
Jerusalem committee, by 'Abd-al-Ra'uf Arna'ut in Jerusalem; date 
not given] 
  [Text] Chairman of the Jerusalem committee Faysal 
al-Husayni has admitted that there is a letter of assurance from 
the Israeli Government regarding the future of Jerusalem and the 
institutions there. He said: "I can say that, among other 
things, there is an assurance in the letter that the Palestinian 
institutions in the city will not be harmed." However, he 
declined to disclose the contents of the letter, saying: "This 
letter was written in such a way as not to be public." In a 
lengthy interview with AL-NAHAR, he stressed that the Jerusalem 
committee has not yet been formed because this requires certain 
measures. He noted, however, that this does not mean that the 
components of the committee are not operating. He said that he 
will visit the Gulf countries and Saudi Arabia in the next few 
days to obtain support for the Jerusalem committee to perform 
its tasks in the face of the challenges imposed on the 
Palestinian institutions in Jerusalem by the Israeli Government. 
When asked if Palestinian President 'Arafat will visit 
Jerusalem, he said: " I believe that 'Arafat will visit 
Jerusalem under Palestinians banners." 
  [Arna'ut] A few weeks ago, Israeli Prime Minister Rabin 
denied that he gave 'Arafat a letter of assurance on Jerusalem, 
but a few days ago, he affirmed that there was such letter. 
There is talk about two letters exchanged between the two 
parties regarding Jerusalem. Is it true that such letters were 
exchanged? 
  [Al-Husayni] Yes, there is a letter of assurance. Among 
other things, the letter reassures us about the status of 
Jerusalem and the institutions there. I do not want to talk 
further on this issue because this letter was written in such a 
way as not to be published. But, I can say that, among other 
things, the letter includes assurances that the institutions in 
Jerusalem will not be infringed upon. 
  [Arna'ut] So why this Israeli campaign against the national 
institutions in Jerusalem? 
  [Al-Husayni] I believe that the campaign is partly a 
reaction 
to the moves of the Israeli right wing. There is a Palestinian 
move not only in response to the Israeli statements but to 
Israeli practical measures. These statements by both parties 
triggered a very sensitive situation. Rabin seems to be trying 
to protect his political image before the Israeli right wing and 
to change some of his stances. When we consider these stances 
we see that they contravene the nature and spirit of the 
[Palestinian-Israeli] agreement [as published] 
  [Arna'ut] Did the meetings between you and Israeli Police 
Minister Moshe Shahal take place on the basis of the letter of 
assurance? 
  [Al-Husayni] The fact that we said that the talks over the 
future of Jerusalem can be discussed at a later stage does not 
mean that the issue of Jerusalem cannot be discussed at present. 
The talks on the future of Jerusalem were postponed to discuss 
the situation in Jerusalem and Palestinian-Israeli relations in 
Jerusalem. We agreed to discuss these issues which were the 
topics of discussion between me and Shahal. However, these 
meetings and their effectiveness are affected by the general 
political atmosphere. If the negotiations in Paris face a 
crisis, they affect the meetings in Jerusalem. Similarly, a 
crisis in the negotiations in Cairo and Oslo and the setbacks in 
implementing the Gaza-Jericho agreement indirectly affect the 
meetings in Jerusalem. 
  [Arna'ut] Are these meetings continuing? 
  [Al-Husayni] Yes. 
  [Arna'ut] How can Shahal, who is the chairman of the 
committee on saving Jerusalem, be your counterpart in discussing 
facilities for the Jerusalem public? 
  [Al-Husayni] I am also the chairman of the Jerusalem 
committee which is also a committee for saving Jerusalem. 
  [Arna'ut] How? 
  [Al-Husayni] We are both interested in the issue of 
Jerusalem. The one who speaks for Jerusalem is supposed to be 
representative of the authorities and not a Palestinian envoy to 
the Israelis. The official facing us is representative of the 
Israeli authorities with their good and bad sides and hence we 
are aware that he has a certain status and a say in matters and 
he steers this committee. We agreed to hold talks with him to 
determine the steps that can be taken. 
  [Arna'ut] What is your information on the Israeli committee 
on saving Jerusalem? 
  [Al-Husayni] This committee was formed by the Israelis 
because they felt that the time for deciding on the issue of 
Jerusalem is approaching and so they want to avoid placing this 
issue on the agenda. Hence, they are trying to take measures to 
strengthen their position when the negotiating process begins. 
This is what prompted us to form the Jerusalem committee to 
demand that the Arab and Islamic world support it, because the 
Israeli committee is not only supported by Israel but by the 
whole world. 
  [Arna'ut] Certain Palestinians say that a bylaw was prepared 
for the Palestinian Jerusalem committee but no practical 
measures have been taken. 
  [Al-Husayni] We announced that we want to form this 
committee 
but have not yet done so because this requires certain 
procedures. However, this does not mean that the components of 
the committee are not operating. The Jerusalem committee in the 
old city is functioning to defend and renovate the buildings in 
the old city within the means available. When we say the 
Jerusalem committee we do not mean the major Jerusalem committee 
with the same resources given to it. We are working to 
establish an initial budget through which the Jerusalem 
committee can function and expand its work. We do not mean a 
major committee whose expenses we cannot afford. 
  [Arna'ut] Does this mean you will kick the ball back into 
the Arab court to gain support for the Jerusalem committee? 
  [Al-Husayni] Yes. I will visit the Gulf and Saudi Arabia in 
the next few days to end this matter. 
  [Arna'ut] Has Saudi Arabia extended aid to the Jerusalem 
committee before? 
  [Al-Husayni] Saudi Arabia has given specific aid, but not to 
us directly. It provided aid to the PLO to assist some existing 
institutions and to meet its obligations and needs for the 
implementation of the agreement. Everybody knows that the PLO 
needed this aid to begin the implementation of the agreement. 
  [Arna'ut] A few months ago you stated that in the next two 
years Jerusalem residents must launch a battle to prove that 
Jerusalem is Arab and Islamic. What measures did the 
Palestinian side take in this regard? 
  [Al-Husayni] A number of things. The battle of Jerusalem is 
a political, diplomatic, economic, social, educational, and 
cultural battle. On the political and diplomatic levels, we are 
doing our best. This place, the Orient House, is one of the 
areas that has made a great effort toward that end. I believe 
that we gained a preliminary presence. This place has turned 
into a meeting place for the Palestinians with foreigners as 
well as among the Palestinians themselves to discuss several 
internal issues. At the economic level, this center has 
endeavored to call for an economic workshop on Jerusalem, and I 
believe we must convene such a conference in Jerusalem as soon 
as possible to send a message to the Israelis that Jerusalem's 
importance is not just religious. The Israelis must realize 
that this is the Palestinians' religious, political, economic, 
and educational capital. Conferences must be held in Jerusalem 
and funds must be obtained for economic projects, educational 
seminars, and conferences of this nature so that the Israelis 
may realize that Jerusalem's fate is not a foregone conclusion. 
Finally, the Palestinian capabilities, skills, and expertise 
must be geared toward defending Jerusalem. At the present 
stage, I believe that we must think of establishing a new 
college, for instance, to be part of the Jerusalem university 
and not part of other Palestinian universities. If there is a 
possibility for renovation or new investments, this must be done 
in Jerusalem. Jerusalem needs at least 30,000 housing units on 
an urgent basis to meet its requirements, and this requires more 
activity than what we are doing now. 
  For this reason, we thought of establishing the Jerusalem 
committee, which will comprise shadow institutions for all the 
other institutions existing in Jerusalem. Each department 
within this committee will follow up the work of its Israeli 
equivalent to pursue things and put pressure to gain the 
Palestinian rights in Jerusalem. 
  [Arna'ut] However, the Palestinian institutions are meeting 
in Ramallah and Bethlehem instead of Jerusalem. 
  [Al-Husayni] This is one of the serious mistakes, where 
committing them is tantamount to acknowledging a fait accompli, 
something that we do not wish to do. 
  [Arna'ut] It seems that the Israeli side views the Orient 
House as the link between the foreign consulates in Jerusalem 
and the Palestinian authority in Gaza and Jericho? 
  [Al-Husayni] The Orient House had a specific role to play 
before the agreement was signed and it will continue to play 
this role. We were offering services to the PLO in Tunis at the 
political level, and we are ready to offer these services to the 
Palestinian authority in Gaza and Jericho. 
  [Arna'ut] If the Orient House is transferred, will foreign 
consulates be opened in Gaza and Jericho? 
  [Al-Husayni] It is very clear that the consulates are 
present 
here to represent the Palestinians inside and outside Jerusalem. 
Thus, under the current situation, it is not enough for them to 
play their role toward Gaza and Jericho and so they will play 
their role toward Jerusalem here and then with the authority 
[sentence as published], and we coordinate with the authority. 
  [Arna'ut] You had your own stand on the Cairo agreement, 
yet you took part in the meeting held by the leadership to form 
the Palestinian authority. It was announced that you would be 
given a ministerial portfolio but this was denied later. Is 
there any Israeli pressure on the question of the participation 
of Arabs from Jerusalem in the Palestinian authority? 
  [Al-Husayni] There is not going to be such a portfolio, 
about 
Jerusalem. But there are responsibilities in this matter. As 
to my responsibilities, whether I am in the authority or not, 
they will be devoted to the Jerusalem issue. 
  [Arna'ut] In the final negotiations on Jerusalem, will you 
ask Israel to pay the money it has levied from the Palestinians 
in the city during the years of occupation? 
  [Al-Husayni] Yes. 
  [Arna'ut] That is the arnona [property tax] and taxes? 
  [Al-Husayni] We will ask for the taxes levied on services 
that have not been given. 
  [Arna'ut] Are you preparing studies and statistics on this 
issue? 
  [Al-Husayni] Yes. There is a special center for planning and 
studies. 
  [Arna'ut] Private housing projects are under way in 
Jerusalem 
now. But we have not heard about large housing projects by the 
Palestinian side. Why? 
  [Al-Husayni] Our basic problem is that there are potentially 
7,000 building licenses. But building on the land given us is a 
complicated matter, that is, this land includes common land and 
some of it is not ready for building upon. I believe that 
committees should be formed to resolve the problem of these 
lands. Countries usually confiscate lands in this way. We must 
conclude an understanding between the owners of these lands and 
the concerned reconstruction parties in Jerusalem. There must 
be agreement between the land owners and those concerned and we 
must find a way to solve the problem of this land. 
  [Arna'ut] Palestinians in Jerusalem are complaining that a 
services establishment in Jerusalem is encouraging owners to 
rent their houses to foreigners at the expense of Jerusalem's 
Palestinians. Has the Jerusalem committee not thought of taking 
measures against it? 
  [Al-Husayni] I believe that we are not supposed to rush into 
renting too much to foreign establishments at the expense of the 
Palestinians. The staff of such an establishment must in fact 
look for new ways and to contact those who own buildings which 
are, for example, appropriate to be offices. It is better to 
let foreign establishments pay to build on the sites that are 
fit to be office complexes and to leave the houses in Jerusalem. 
  [Arna'ut] Yehuda Olmert said that he will close Orient 
House. 
What is your response? 
  [Al-Husayni] He has said so and I believe that what he said 
does not serve the cause of peace or Israel. 
  [Arna'ut] Do you believe that President 'Arafat will visit 
Jerusalem? 
  [Al-Husayni]I believe that 'Arafat will visit Jerusalem 
under 
the Palestinian flags.

  [Text] Gaza, AL-QUDS Information office -- Lawyer Khalid 
al-Qidrah, official in charge of the city's Liaison Committee, 
has stressed that all former rules applying to citizens under 30 
years old have been abolished. These people have been given 
temporary identification cards within the framework of the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement. He said that every citizen outside the 
homeland can return. Regarding travel, every citizen who wants 
to travel abroad has a right to do so without a permit from the 
self-rule area. Al- Qidrah emphasized that the magnetized ID 
cards will be abolished in the near future because they are 
inapplicable in the self-rule area, which now enjoys special 
powers under the Palestinian National Authority. 
  Engineer Furayj Ahmad al-Khayri, official in charge of the 
Coordination Committee, said that every time his committee meets 
with the Israeli counterpart he calls for going back to the 
rules that were valid before the closure of the Gaza Strip on 29 
March 1993, including travel rights for girls under 16 years old 
and people older than 50 without obtaining permits. He said 
that these measures are no longer necessary because we now live 
in a stage of peace, which we as Palestinians recognize. The 
Israeli side should treat us accordingly, he said. 
  Al-Khayari stressed that trade and economy in the Gaza Strip 
are in a state of collapse as a result of the occupation. We 
are doing all we can to build a stable economy and trade to 
encourage Palestinian, Arab, and foreign financiers to invest. 
He noted that without Israeli encouragement and confidence 
there can be no progress. He said that university professors 
and students should not be denied permits to join their 
universities and that such pressure will turn them from 
advocates of peace in the West Bank into fighters confronting 
the occupation. He added that we want to live in peace.

  [Text] Tunis, 6 Jun (MENA) -- Last night Egyptian Foreign 
Minister 'Amr Musa received Mahmud 'Abbas, alias Abu-Mazin, PLO 
Executive Committee member; and Ahmad Quray', minister of 
economy and trade for the Palestinian National Authority. They 
reviewed the Palestinian-Israeli peace process and the steps 
taken so far by the PLO to implement the Palestinian self-rule 
agreement in Gaza and Jericho signed in Cairo on 4 May. 
  Musa and the Palestinian officials also discussed the 
difficulties and obstacles facing the completion of the 
implementation of the agreement and the return of PLO Chairman 
Yasir 'Arafat and the members of the Palestinian leadership to 
Jericho and Gaza. The difficulties and obstacles are 
represented by the lack of necessary funds for the Palestinian 
National Authority. So far the Authority has not received the 
funds promised by donor countries.

<F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Eytan Rabin] </F>
  [Text] Speaking at a closed forum in Gaza last weekend, 
Attorney Furayh Abu-Middayn, who the PLO chairman appointed 
justice minister in the Palestinian Authority, revealed that the 
three Israeli MIA's from the battle of al-Sultan Ya'qub -- 
Zekharya Baumel, Tzvi Feldman, and Yehuda Katz -- were buried by 
a squad belonging to Abu-Jihad [Khalil al-Wazir]. According to 
him, today there are five other people who know where the bodies 
are buried, but he would not name them. 
  This is the first time such a high-ranking Palestinian 
official has admitted that the PLO has information regarding the 
three Israeli MIA's from the al-Sultan Ya'aqub battle. 
Abu-Middayn's remarks were published in the East Jerusalem 
paper AL-QUDS two days ago. According to the paper, Abu-Middayn 
said: "Once we find the bodies of the three Israeli soldiers, 
the problem of the Palestinian prisoners will be solved." 
Abu-Middayn said Israel is willing to release all the 
Palestinian prisoners in return for the bodies of the three 
soldiers who have been missing since 1982 and stressed that the 
problem of the MIA's is on the verge of solution. 
  Abu-Middayn further said at the Gaza gathering that all the 
Palestinian prisoners should be released in view of the Oslo 
agreement, "but Israel has reservations about this. It is no 
secret that the matter depends on the bodies of the three 
Israeli soldiers, which are being held by Palestinians." 
  Several months ago, the PLO delivered half of MIA Baumel's 
dog tag to the defense establishment. 
  A senior IDF [Israel Defense Forces] officer has said that 
the PLO information on the MIA's is reliable. According to the 
officer, it is obvious that the PLO has information regarding 
the three MIA's from the al-Sultan Ya'qub battle, and Israel 
expects to receive that information. 
  Defense establishment sources have said that Abu-Middayn's 
remarks are interesting but that Israel continues to seek 
information about all its MIA's, including those from the 
al-Sultan Ya'qub battle. The reference is to the bodies of 
MIA's Yosi Fink and Rahamim Alsheikh as well and to information 
about captive navigator Ron Arad. 
  Two years ago, Uri Lubrani, who headed the negotiating team 
on the MIA and POW issue, was relieved of this task, and it was 
handed over to Major General Yoram Ya'ir, head of the IDF 
Personnel Branch. 
  At present, 8,000 Palestinian prisoners are being held in 
IDF 
detention facilities. So far, some 2,000 prisoners and 
detainees have been released after pledging in writing not to 
carry out terror attacks and declaring their support for the 
peace process. 
  At the Gaza gathering, Abu-Middayn further said that the 
Palestinian leadership has established a special ministry to 
deal with casualties and prisoners. According to him, the 
office will handle the rehabilitation of the casualties and 
prisoners and take care of their needs. No decision on who will 
head this ministry has been made yet.

chartered by Saudi Arabia to Egypt, their last stop before they 
proceed to the Gaza Strip. The group, officially regarded a 
part of the Palestine Liberation Army, is comprised of personnel 
who served over the past few years on PLO-related civic duties. 
They will travel by bus from Egypt to the crossing point in 
Rafah tomorrow, Sunday, on their way to the Gaza Strip.

<F P=106> [Interview with 'Abdallah al-Franji, head of the PLO office </F>
in Bonn, by Hero Buss; place not given -- live] 
  [Text] [Buss] Good morning, Mr. Al-Franji. 
  [Al-Franji] Good morning. 
  [Buss] Mr. Al-Franji, yesterday, REUTERS ran the following 
statement, and I quote: Israel has called on PLO Chairman Yasir 
'Arafat to tackle effectively the problems of the 
self-administrated areas Gaza Strip and Jericho. Regarding 
'Arafat's complaints about international financial aid, which 
was promised but has not been provided yet, a spokesman for the 
Israeli Government reacted with criticism and said that 'Arafat 
had acted like a beggar instead of taking action. Government 
spokesman Drori said that it was time for 'Arafat to stop 
behaving like a beggar and stop whining, and that he should 
tackle the problems there effectively. End quote. 
  Mr. Al-Franji, apart from the polemical rhetoric, the 
Israelis seem to be worried. 
  [Al-Franji] I would say that this is not the right way for 
Israel to deal with 'Arafat. 'Arafat is a partner in the peace 
process in the region, and 'Arafat has actually done a lot to 
advance the peace process to the current stage. Of course, the 
problems left by Israel after 27 years of occupation are 
enormous. One cannot solve these problems overnight. We have 
financial problems. The countries that promised to support the 
Palestinian people insist on certain conditions that cannot be 
fulfilled so easily. The Israelis, who took a lot of money off 
the Palestinians in those years, and who committed themselves to 
pay parts of this money to the Palestinians and to 'Arafat, have 
not done so. This is why 'Arafat cannot overcome the problems 
alone. And it is understandable that 'Arafat cannot and will 
not cope with the problems alone. 
  [Buss] Is there a practical reason for 'Arafat and the PLO 
leadership not to have moved yet to the now autonomous 
Palestinian areas? 
  [Al-Franji] One reason is that 'Arafat has been ill for a 
week. Actually, it is the second time he has been ill. This is 
the only reason that our move has been delayed. Nevertheless, 
we have sent some people there, and we have taken over 
responsibility in the Gaza Strip, and things are working, 
working not too badly. One has hardly heard of people being 
injured or killed in this region since we took over. I hope 
that 'Arafat gets better soon and that he will soon be able to 
assume his duties. 
  [Buss] Is there anything at all that the PLO leadership 
might be able to administer or solve better from Tunis than from 
a base in the autonomous regions? 
  [Al-Franji] Certainly not. Any Palestinians bearing 
responsibility within the PLO would like to go there right away. 
However, there are many conditions that are making this 
difficult. And these conditions are one part of the agreement 
between us and the Israelis. If I were to react today to the 
declaration of the Israeli or the Israeli Government Spokesman 
Drori, then we would thwart this peace process [dann werden wir 
diesen Prozess des Friedens platzen lassen], which is why we 
have to deal with one another with patience, with a sense of 
responsibility, and with understanding. This is what I cannot 
see on the part of some Israelis. There are other Israelis who, 
of course, do not talk like that official Israeli spokesman or 
say such things as he just has. 
  [Buss] Could you elaborate on that? What exactly is it that 
could thwart the process? 
  [Al-Franji] I do not want to talk about the failure of this 
process. All I would like to say is that we are now bearing 
responsibility together, and that we must help one another. It 
is very difficult. It is not so simple that one could say: 
Well, the PLO must now rapidly get all the problems under 
control left by the Israelis after 27 years of occupation. We 
cannot do that. We must get help from the Israelis and from the 
Arab world, and help from Europe and the United States. I 
cannot imagine that the United States, which promised a lot and 
bears great responsibility for this process, that it will remain 
so passive toward us. One must not really do that. Peace in 
this region is not just a matter for the Palestinians and 
Israelis alone, it is a matter for the international community. 
And I hope that the other parties will now assume their share 
in responsibility so that the PLO will be able to get the 
problems in the occupied territories under control. 
  [Buss] As far as the Israeli heritage, the legacy in 
Palestine is concerned, people in Israel hold a different view. 
It has been said, for example, that one even considerably 
extended the infrastructure in the formerly occupied territories. 
  [Al-Franji] Well, I do not want to discuss what the Israelis 
did and what they did not do. It was an ugly time, during which 
we could not see the Israelis as a -- let us say -- liberator, 
or a helper. We did not act any differently from other peoples 
that were occupied, for example. We are glad about it. Of 
course, the transition is very difficult and complicated. The 
problem is not that the Palestinians and the PLO are 
unqualified, but simply that we lack the funds. For many years 
we spent money on the occupied territories, and we -- and not 
the Israelis -- continued to build up many things during the era 
of occupation. We built the universities there, we established 
the committees, the organizations, the trade unions, everything, 
while the Israelis had laws that prevented us from operating 
these institutions in the appropriate way. 
  [Buss] Mr. Al-Franji, let us briefly talk about the 
financial aid. It has been said that you were promised $2.4 
billion in aid, money that is badly needed. Who promised how 
much, and who is now unwilling to pay? 
  [Al-Franji] The United States has promised a lot -- $500 
million. The European Community promised $600 million, the 
World Bank, and many other institutions also promised money. 
The way in which the donor countries or the countries that 
wanted to provide the money are dealing with one another is not 
smooth enough so that one party would say: we now give the 
Palestinians so much money for the next two or three months or 
the coming six months to make sure they can work. They also 
have difficulties and are facing complications, and one can say 
that there is not a single organization that would be 
responsible for all the donors that have so far provided money 
or intend to do so. On the part of the Palestinians, we have 
not yet nominated all members of the government that is to 
assume responsibility. However, we hope that we can do that 
within a week, and we are also hoping that the World Bank will 
not continue to place its conditions so firmly and difficult on 
the head of the Palestinians [passage as heard] so that we will 
be able to take the necessary steps to overcome this difficult 
situation.

  [Text] The Democratic Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine [DFLP] has said the fall of some 40 Palestinians 
injured in Hebron by Israeli occupation troops' gunfire within 
view of foreign observers confirms once again that the foreign 
presence in its current form does not provide effective 
international protection of the Palestinian people. 
  In a statement issued today, the DFLP says the 
implementation 
of Resolution 904 was just a deal between the Oslo team and 
Israel to expedite the implementation of the self-rule 
administration in Gaza and Jericho, at the expense of the 
Palestinian people, their interests, and their national rights. 
The DFLP urges the international community and peace-loving 
forces to work seriously to provide effective international 
protection of the Palestinian people in the occupied territories 
as a first step on the path to implementing the resolutions of 
international legitimacy. 
  DFLP Secretary General Nayif Hawatimah reiterated his 
rejection of the Gaza-Jericho agreement and the applications 
agreement in Cairo. He considered it a deal of individual 
submission that will only lead to more frivolous play and 
self-deception. In statements, Hawatimah said these separate 
deals were struck behind the back of the Palestinian people and 
against their national will. He said preparations are under way 
now to hold a broad-based popular conference that will reaffirm 
rejection of what is going on and seek to establish the national 
terms of reference. He said the agreement will not fall by a 
magic blow, but will need struggle and ceaseless work within the 
ranks of the Palestinian people inside and outside the occupied 
homeland. He called for improving the alliance of the 
Palestinian forces, as well as all other forces that reject the 
agreement. 
  Hawatimah also reaffirmed the DFLP's refusal to participate 
in any way in the self-rule authority because the question, he 
said, has never been that of quotas, but a national issue in the 
first place.

  [Text] The Central Committee of the [dissident] Palestine 
National Liberation Movement, Fatah, has stressed that the 
Israeli military escalation against Lebanon falls within the 
context of exerting pressure against Syria through Lebanon to 
make it abandon its national and pan-Arab positions, which 
reject secret and public agreements similar to the recent Cairo 
agreement between 'Arafat and Rabin. 
  This emerged in a statement issued by the Central Committee 
today. The statement reviews the threats, objectives, and 
dimensions of the Israeli military escalation against Lebanon at 
this time in particular and the Western world's silence about 
it. The statement says: This escalation comes in continuation 
of the attempts by Israel and the hostile forces to strike at 
the forces that oppose the Gaza-Jericho agreement in order to 
implement this agreement, pave the way for it, and market it 
through the Palestinian gate to our Arab region. 
  The statement praises the heroism and steadfastness of the 
national and Islamic resistance in Lebanon and warns our masses 
against the dimensions and threats of the new Israeli military 
escalation. It stresses that struggle will continue until the 
occupied territories are liberated. 
  The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] 
also stressed that the Israeli attacks against Lebanon confirm 
the weakness of the Gaza-Jericho agreement and the true 
intentions of Israel's phony calls for peace with Lebanon and 
the Arabs. 
  In a statement issued today on the anniversary of the 5 June 
1967 Israeli aggression against the Arab nation, the DFLP says 
it urges everyone to confront Israel's schemes and savage 
aggression, in a manner that bolsters the march of the valiant 
intifadah in the occupied territories and ensures the 
implementation of the resolutions of international legitimacy, 
which guarantee to the Palestinian people the right to liberate 
their land, determine their own future, and establish their 
independent state.

<F P=106> [Interview with Muhammad 'Abbas, secretary general of the </F>
Palestine Liberation Front, by 'Imad al-Dik in Baghdad; date not 
given] 
  [Excerpts] [Al-Dik] What is your opinion on the 
agreements signed between the PLO and Israel? 
  ['Abbas] In principle, we oppose this plan, and we have 
expressed our opposition through various means and in different 
places, including the PLO institutions, the Executive Committee, 
the Central Council, and the subsidiary institutions, and also 
whenever we had an opportunity to criticize this plan or oppose 
this agreement. This is because we view this agreement as a 
relinquishment of the constant national principles in which we 
believe and for which we have offered sacrifices. Our 
Palestinian Arab people have paid a great price to achieve their 
aspirations and objectives, which are much greater than the 
maximum benefits offered by this agreement. This agreement does 
not achieve even the minimum of our people's aspirations. It 
was signed under circumstances in which the balance of power was 
in favor of the enemy by all standards. In brief, when the 
balance of power is in favor of the enemy, an agreement serving 
the enemy's interest is the result. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Dik] What are your future plans for dealing with the new 
situation in view of the Israeli-Palestinian agreement? 
  ['Abbas] We confronted this agreement even before it was 
signed. Now, instead of just rejecting the agreement we must 
work so that this agreement does not turn into the end result of 
the Palestinian struggle. 
  [Al-Dik] Do you believe that there is an agreement between 
'Arafat and the Israelis on not releasing the detainees who 
oppose the peace march? 
  ['Abbas] Israel has publicly declared this, so it does not 
need an agreement. However, the PLO leadership, which 
represents the Palestinian people, cannot sign such an agreement 
because this leadership does not distinguish between 
Palestinians and because it is duty-bound to protect the 
Palestinian people. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Dik] What will be the [Palestine Liberation] Front's 
position on the Palestinian police if the latter confronts the 
Front's elements who attack the Zionists? 
  ['Abbas] The Arab borders are wide, and so is the area on 
which the Zionists are present. When we decide to fight the 
enemy, we will certainly choose a way that will keep us away 
from clashes with our people's sons in terms of the police and 
security forces. We will also complete our march without 
involving ourselves in a confrontation with any nationalist 
Palestinian. 
  [Al-Dik] As a Front, was participation in the self-rule 
authority offered to you? 
  ['Abbas] Yes, it was directly proposed to us in our capacity 
as a part of the PLO. Our choice was to join the field 
institutions that are directly concerned with our people's 
situation in the self-rule areas. Participation in the 
self-rule authority, however, was left for the future because it 
will take a political decision by the organization's bodies. We 
have not made a final decision on this issue, and we have 
requested some time to consider it. The final decision, 
however, will be made by the Front's leadership, although my 
personal opinion is not to participate. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Dik] Following the [Israeli-PLO] agreement, is it 
possible that such agreements can end the state of animosity and 
conflict with the Zionist enemy? 
  ['Abbas] Of course not. The current solution is fully in 
line with the present situation, which is not a normal 
situation. A solution that would end the conflict should 
necessarily take into account the interests and rights of the 
Palestinian and Arab peoples. I can see no current solution to 
the conflict. However, I can see a form of truce imposed by the 
influential world forces. The extent of these forces' influence 
may perpetuate or shorten such a truce. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Palestinian leaders in the territories are focusing 
efforts on East Jerusalem, mainly in a bid to lift the closure 
which has separated the city from the rest of the territories. 
Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] has distributed a leaflet 
in the territories calling for an exacerbation of the battle 
until Jerusalem is liberated. Our correspondent Moti Amir 
reports: 
  [Begin Amir recording] A senior Palestinian source stressed 
yesterday that PLO supporters will focus their political 
activity on the issue of East Jerusalem. The source stressed 
that the Palestinians will not remain silent in the face of 
demonstrations by the Israeli right wing, such as that organized 
by the Likud yesterday outside the Old City's walls. Faysal 
al-Husayni will hold a discussion on Jerusalem this afternoon at 
the Orient House building and report on the latest steps taken 
by the Israeli Government against Palestinian institutions in 
the eastern part of the city. 
  Hamas has also exhorted its followers to put an emphasis on 
the struggle over Jerusalem. In a special leaflet distributed 
in the territories yesterday, 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam members were 
called upon to step up activities against Israel until what the 
leaflet described as the liberation of all of the homeland, 
including Jerusalem. 
  The Palestinian source explained that the PLO will now 
concentrate its efforts on lifting the closure on East 
Jerusalem, which has severed the city from the territories. 
  In discussions held yesterday by Palestinian self-government 
officials in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, the police commanders 
in both areas expressed praise for the rapid organization of the 
Palestinian forces and noted that they believe the police are 
operating smoothly and satisfactorily despite all the 
difficulties. 
  General 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya, who was head of the 
Palestinian delegation on security affairs in the peace 
negotiations, crossed through the Rafah border terminal into the 
Gaza Strip yesterday. Gen. al-Yahya will be in charge of public 
security in the autonomous areas, together with Police Commander 
Nasr Yusuf. 
  An advance force of 36 Palestinian intelligence officers has 
arrived in Jericho. The men received training in intelligence 
work in Egypt, Algeria, and Tunis. They will mainly be in 
charge of the PLO's military intelligence. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Flow of Western Weapons Does Not Serve the </F>
Peace Process"] 
  [Text] Douglas Hurd, secretary of state for foreign and 
commonwealth affairs, has justified the British Government's 
decision to lift the arms embargo of Israel as a result of the 
encouraging developments in the peace process. To hide the 
reality of its bias toward Israel in making this decision, Hurd 
suggested that Britain is ready to reconsider the arms embargo 
the European Union has imposed on Syria, but only if the 
Syrian-Israeli negotiations make progress. 
  The British decision is strange in more ways than one. It is 
clearly biased toward Israel, since it provides that country 
with the chance to stockpile more weapons within the framework 
of what is called qualitative military superiority, which the 
West in general and the United States in particular have tried 
to secure for Israel over the years in confronting the Arab 
World. It is also strange because this decision is wrapped in 
the slogan of peace. Everyone knows that weapons are the exact 
opposite of true peace and that any progress toward peace 
requires a real decrease in armaments and strict supervision of 
the weapons in the region. These topics are supposed to be 
handled by the multilateral armament supervision committee, 
which came out of the Madrid conference. 
  In fact, the British decision was not the only one that 
contradicts the spirit and goals of the peace process in the 
region. Since the convention of the Madrid peace conference, the 
United States has provided Israel with many guarantees that it 
will enable that country to continue its military superiority 
and will continue to provide it with huge military aid. France 
also agreed with Israel recently to terminate the freeze on 
military cooperation between the two sides. 
  Thus, at a time when the West is hoisting the banner of 
bolstering the peace process in the region, in practice it is 
bolstering Israel's military power, which contradicts the 
objectives of the peace process and the roles the United States 
and Europe are supposed to play. This also strengthens the 
existing doubts that the talk about peace is contrary to real 
intentions. Who needs weapons during the age of peace? Who 
will these arms be directed against? 
  The essential question posed to Britain and other countries 
that are hastening to change their previous stances that were 
based on the major causes of the conflict, foremost of which is 
the Israeli occupation, is: Has the Israeli occupation of 
Palestinian and Arab territories ended? And does taking new 
stances really contribute toward ending this occupation and 
eliminating the reasons for the Arab-Israeli conflict, or are 
they a new contribution by the West to strengthen Israel's 
adherence to the stances that it still proposes to this day and 
that are the major obstacles to a just peace?

<F P=106> [Report on speech by President Hashemi-Rafsanjani at </F>
ceremony marking the anniversary of Imam Khomeyni's death; on 3 
June; place not given] 
  [Text] Last night, mourning ceremonies on the occasion of 
the demise of the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran were 
held with the participation of throngs of pilgrims, mourners, 
and foreign guests at the pure mausoleum of Imam Khomeyni, may 
God's peace be upon him. 
  At these ceremonies, self-flagellation by mourning groups 
and 
participants and chanting of lamentations were carried out. 
President Hashemi-Rafsanjani addressed the gathering, 
elaborating on the dimensions of the thinking, and the political 
characteristics of Imam Khomeyni, may God be pleased with him. 
He referred to his social impact in the renaissance of Islam. 
  President Hashemi-Rafsanjani alluded to the jurisprudential, 
spiritual, moral, ethical, and inspirational aspects of the 
thinking of Imam Khomeyni--may his soul be sanctified--and 
deemed his existence a divine bounty and stressed: The Imam's 
inspiration was the quintessence of these qualities. 
  President Hashemi-Rafsanjani added: The Islamic Revolution 
of Iran led by Imam Khomeyni--may God be pleased with him--in 
the course of the history of Islam was unprecedented after the 
esteemed Prophet of Islam, may God's peace and blessings be upon 
him and his scion, in such a manner that it can be described as 
a miracle. 
  He stressed: Imam Khomeyni, may God's blessings be upon him, 
made an appropriate decision regarding the selection of the next 
leader by playing the best role at this juncture in history. If 
today we are able to ward off spewing venom, mischiefmongering, 
discord, and the destructive activities of the enemy, it is 
because we are treading the path of the revolution blazed by the 
imam behind the leader of the revolution without the slightest 
hesitation, and it is entirely due to the apt management of 
Ayatollah Khamene'i. 
  President Hashemi-Rafsanjani continued: Five years ago, at 
this same time, we were apprehensive about the future of the 
revolution. However, our trepidation was eliminated by the 
imam's guidance and with the allusions and clear indications by 
the imam regarding the future; the situation became completely 
obvious in this regard. He explained: The imam propounded the 
issue of leadership in such a manner that it would be safe from 
the treachery of the enemies who were constantly awaiting an 
opportunity to settle scores and to capitalize on the vacuum in 
the leadership. Therefore, he did not announce any individual 
choice openly. However, we found our path in the light of the 
imam's wishes and the Assembly of Experts--after these allusions 
evolved into a definite form--was able to make a suitable 
decision about the future leadership. 
  The president emphasized: During the course of the Islamic 
Revolution, we have perceived divine succor and bounties and the 
God of our imam did not stint in showering His kindness and 
blessings on the Islamic ummah. Following the demise of the 
imam, the multifaceted and comprehensive expediency and 
management continued to resolve the problems of the revolution 
in such a manner that it went on treading its path. The fear 
that had weighed on the hearts of the ever-present-on-the-scene 
ummah metamorphosed into confidence, trust, and self-reliance 
and we continued on the imam's path. 
  In another part of his speech, President Hashemi-Rafsanjani 
expressed his gratitude to Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Seyyed 
Ahmad Khomeyni, the esteemed remembrance of the imam, for his 
services during the struggle period, and in the aftermath of the 
revolution and he also thanked the household of the imam. 
  At the conclusion of his remarks, the president said that if 
today we are able to continue down our path behind the rightful 
successor of the imam -- who is the best person imaginable to 
shoulder this responsibility, to reconstruct the country, and to 
insist on the aspirations of the imam -- it is entirely due to 
the guidance and foresight of our dear imam.

  [Text] On the death anniversary of His Eminence Imam 
Khomeyni, may his soul be sanctified, last night the tomb of the 
great leader was the scene of a large number of people who had 
gathered there to mourn him and to pay homage to him. 
  Speaking to the mourners, Majles Speaker Nateq-Nuri pointed 
out that five years after the death of the founder of the 
Islamic Republic, Imam Khomeyni's line and path are continuing 
strongly, he said that the secret behind the success of the 
Islamic revolution is the bond between the ummah and the supreme 
leader. He added: With all the knowledge that it has of the 
Imam, the Islamic Republic can still not fully understand the 
various aspects of his character. The Majles speaker said: It 
is a source of pride for the rule of the supreme leader and for 
the Islamic Republic to have victoriously stood up for eight 
years in front of the entire world of arrogance to defend its 
religion and homeland. 
  Later in his remarks, Nateq-Nuri stressed that our 
government 
and nation would defend the country's territorial integrity with 
its life and said: We believe that regional security is 
beneficial to all the regional countries and that irresponsible 
remarks and satanic overtures by some regional countries would 
not benefit peace and security in the region. 
  The head of the legislative branch referred to the stances 
of 
the esteemed leader in support of the Muslims and the oppressed 
of the world and said: As far as Palestine is concerned, the 
only alternative is that the Zionists leave the occupied 
territories and that the Palestinians' sovereignty be 
established over their land.

  [Excerpt] At a meeting with foreign dignitaries taking part 
in the ceremonies marking the fifth anniversary of the death of 
His Holiness Imam Khomeyni, may his soul be sanctified, the 
president of the Islamic Republic of Iran ['Ali Akbar 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani] stressed the need for unity among the world 
Muslims. 
  The president said: The big problem of the world of Islam is 
the lack of unity between Muslims. The Islamic Republic of Iran 
will do its best to create unity and has reached out the hand of 
unity toward all Islamic countries. 
  According to our correspondent, Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani said: 
The Islamic Republic of Iran has no intention of interfering in 
the internal affairs of any country. We hope Islamic 
governments do not interpret our advice as interference in their 
domestic affairs. 
  Referring to the fact that Islamic Iran is very serious in 
the country's construction the president said: Our dependence on 
the outside world is being reduced every day. What worries us 
today is the existence of problems in the world of Islam, such 
as in Yemen, Afghanistan, Bosnia, and Palestine. 
  Stressing that the Islamic revolution has continued on its 
course for the past 15 years without any foreign backing, he 
said the success and the historical miracle stem from the power 
of Islam and the wise leadership of the imam [Khomeyni]. 
  Criticizing certain Islamic governments for mischief-making 
against the Islamic revolution, the president said: They intend 
to divert toward Iran the opposition of world Muslims to Israel. 
That is an astonishing crime and very woeful for the Muslim 
world. 
  The president added: Public opinion in the world of Islam 
has 
been awakened. We hope that the enemies of Islam will realize 
that and cease their mischief-making. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tehran, June 5, IRNA -- Various sectors of the 
people from Tehran and the provinces here today commemorated the 
anniversary of the 15th of Khordad (June 5, 1963), the bloody 
uprising and the beginning of the Islamic revolution. 
  The uprising which led to Imam Khomeyni's arrest by the 
monarchial regime and subsequent exile, was the first spark of 
the Islamic revolution, which 15 years later in February 1979, 
illuminated Iran and the world with millions lining the streets 
to welcome home their triumphant leader. 
  Since then, the teeming millions have continued their 
faithful presence on the scenes, setting up new records at his 
funeral service in 1989, and yesterday, as in past years, they 
once again made their presence felt at his mausoleum. 
  Hojjat ol-Eslam Mohammad 'Ali Ansari, head of the 
headquarters for organizing the fifth anniversary of Imam 
Khomeyni's departure, said the people of Iran who, by their 
presence on the scene from the outset, had carried out the 
directives of the father of the Islamic revolution will continue 
in the same path by obeying the orders of the leader of the 
Islamic republic Ayatollah Khamene'i. 
  In today's ceremonies that was observed in an atmosphere 
permeated with grief and sorrow the mourners of Imam Khomeyni, 
beating their chests, wept on the anniversary of the great loss, 
and also praised the martyrs of the June 5, 1963 uprising for 
their valor and courage in confronting the oppressive monarchy. 
  Praising the solid presence on the scene on the occasion of 
the anniversary of the June 5 uprising, Hojjat Ansari recalled 
the infamous storming of the Feizieh theological school by 
soldiers of the Shah who killed and wounded many students, and 
analyzed the crucial role of Imam Khomeyni from the beginning of 
the Islamic movement. 
  He said at a time when the so-called white revolution of the 
Shah was being bandied about with demagogical slogans, Imam 
Khomeyni, fully knowledgeable about the plots being hatched 
entered the political scene and proved to the Muslims of Iran 
and the world that the Pahalvi monarchy was against Islam. 
  On behalf of Imam Khomeyni's son Hojjat ol-Eslam Ahmad 
Khomeyni, Ansari thanked the people as well as foreign guests in 
Iran for their participation in Saturday's ceremonies. 
  The anniversary of the June 5 uprising was also observed in 
other towns and cities throughout the Islamic republic Sunday. 
  In Ilam Province and its border towns and cities, people 
marked the uprising and remembered the role of the imam. 
  In Sari, Mazendaran Province, head of the Culture and 
Islamic 
Guidance Commission of the Majles Hojjat ol-Eslam Reza Taqavi 
said at the Babol theological school that June 5 was a turning 
point in the history of the Islamic revolution. 
  In Isfahan, member of the Association of Theological 
Teachers 
of Qom, said many elements were responsible for the victory of 
the Islamic revolution, but the most important of them was the 
leadership of the Imam and his efforts to captivate the people's 
hearts. 
  Similar ceremonies were observed in all towns and cities 
throughout the country at which ulema and other personalities 
spoke.

  [Text] Our foreign minister, Dr. Velayati, who had gone to 
Egypt to attend the 11th session of the Nonaligned Movement 
foreign ministers and to Syria for talks with Syrian officials, 
returned to Tehran last night. 
  In an exclusive interview with our correspondent, he 
explained the outcome of these visits. Regarding the status of 
the Nonaligned Movement, Dr. Velayati said: The Nonaligned 
Movement has found its true identity. The consensus that 
currently exists among most of the members on important 
international issues can steer the movement toward true 
political independence. This could make the Nonaligned Movement 
a fulcrum for strengthening the position of Third World 
countries in combating the influential powers of the world. 
  [Begin Velayati recording] Of course, these are relative 
matters. When we say that the movement is nonaligned, the 
concept is that influential powers will not be able to 
infiltrate. However in general, the movement should be 
maintained as a tribune [preceding word in English] for the 
countries of the Third World or countries of the South. This 
was the unanimous view of all the members of the movement. In 
fact, with countries such as South Africa joining the movement 
and the acceptance of new members with observer and guest 
status, we are witnessing a new peak for the Nonaligned Movement 
in the aftermath of the dissolution of the former Soviet Union. 
When the Soviet Union disintegrated, there was a sort of 
aimlessness and ambivalence in the movement. After two or three 
years, I can say that the movement has once again found its 
niche. [end recording] 
  Referring to the other matters which were discussed at the 
Nonaligned Movement foreign ministers' session in Cairo in 
addition to important international matters and the future of 
the movement, Dr. Velayati said that discussions were also held 
on the structure of the United Nations and on human rights. He 
said: During this session, most of the members stressed that 
Colombia should host the Nonaligned Movement's next summit. 
  Commenting on the most important decision on regional issues 
made at the session, Dr. Velayati said: 
  [Begin recording] [Velayati] Regarding regional issues, 
extremely appropriate decisions were made in favor of Lebanon 
and against Israeli attacks. By consensus, Israel was denounced 
by 109 countries for its savage attacks on Lebanon. Some 
valuable decisions were approved in favor of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
and against the Serbs. This marks a development in the 
Nonaligned Movement. Approximately two and a half years ago, 
when we raised the issue in Indonesia, it was difficult to get 
even a tepid decision adopted against Belgrade. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Were there any discussions 
about the expulsion of Serbia from the movement? 
  [Velayati] The Belgrade delegate was not even accepted at 
this session. In view of the fact that former Yugoslavia was 
one of the founding members of the Nonaligned Movement, it was a 
given that the Serbia-Montenegro delegate would not be 
considered a representative of the former Yugoslavia. [end

  It may be recalled that on his way back to Tehran, Dr. 
Velayati met the Syrian President, Hafiz al-Asad and other 
high-level Syrian officials and conveyed a message from 
President Hashemi-Rafsanjani to President Hafiz al-Asad. During 
this visit which took place in the aftermath of the Zionist 
regime's attack on southern Lebanon, Dr. Velayati met Sayyid 
Hasan Nasrallah, the secretary general of the Lebanese Hizballah 
and conveyed the sympathies and renewed support of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran for the oppressed people of Lebanon.

<F P=106> [Second Friday prayer sermon by Ayatollyah Yazdi in Tehran </F>
on 3 June -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God, the compassionate, the 
merciful. [Passage omitted: Yazdi praises the virtues and 
achievements of Ayatollah Khomeyni] 
  The esteemed leader [Ayatooal Khamene'i] has made several 
speeches at meetings which have very interesting points, which 
we have all heard, at meetings with Majlis deputies and dear 
guests who came to take part in the ceremonies on the fifth 
anniversary of the Imam's death. [passage omitted] 
  These are the words of the esteemed leader, His Eminence 
Ayatollah Khamene'i. [crowd chants slogans in praise of 
Khamene'i] After the necessary instructions the nation, the 
government, and the country's officials are alert. But that is 
not enough. You must be aware and not do anything that would 
give the enemy hope. [passage omitted] 
  As the esteemed leader said, we have never claimed that 
there 
are no difficulties in the country. Or that there are no 
problems in my own sector, the country's judiciary. We would 
never claim that. 
  However, fairness is also a good thing. One must open one's 
eyes to see all the tasks which have been accomplished during 
the present era when the country is undergoing reconstruction 
after freeing itself from the burden of the war and managing to 
find the means for its reconstruction. A lot of work has been 
carried out in all sectors. In my own area of work, for 
instance, why is it that when you sit together you are not 
prepared to mention one single positive point about the judicial 
apparatus? When a weakness appears in a certain corner, even 
though the judiciary has dealt with it and has dismissed the 
offender, you still choose to pretend that the individual is 
still present in the judiciary, and then tend to judge the whole 
apparatus on the basis of that individual. Is this fair? 
  When the eminent leader says that you should not do anything 
which could inspire hope among the enemies, he is obviously 
referring to such things. That is to say overlooking the 
positive points at a time when the officials of the country are 
working hard and rendering their services. When we review the 
situation in this country, we see all our means of oversight and 
scrutiny, as well as all our honorable, faithful, pious and 
religious judges, who constitute high-ranking strata in the 
society and are engaged in their works with such integrity, 
sincerity and piety. 
  However, you still tend to pay attention to a particular 
judge whom we have already arrested on the basis of a special 
warrant without letting everyone know about it -- as we dealt 
with the matter in a confidential manner and only informed those 
whom we had to inform. We have arrested and sacked this judge, 
and we have also clarified his charges and forced him to pay 
back to the public funds that he had embezzled. However, when a 
number of individuals sit together, they still tend to say that 
the judicial power is such and such. 
  This was an example from my own area of work. The situation 
regarding the esteemed government is very much the same. Why 
are you not prepared to mention one single positive aspect of 
all the work which has been carried out by the government? 
However, you invariably choose to pick one negative point and 
dwell on that. The Majlis too has done a great deal of service 
in creating so much coordination and harmony between the 
judicial and executive branches, carrying out so much 
legislation, supervision, research, and dealing with so many 
complaints based on Article 90. 
  You choose not to see all these services, but you question 
the Majlis when a certain deputy utters something somewhere. Is 
this right? [Passage omitted: Yazdi emphasizes parts of 
guidelines by Khamene'i on importance of constructive criticism 
and advice] 
  I am cancelling the remainder of my sermon since we are 
overrunning on time and prayers could be delayed. I have written 
down one or two sentences in Arabic but before that: Israel and 
the kidnapping by Israel which does not comply with any of the 
international regulations and laws and is a blatant violation of 
all international regulations; a violation of human rights! 
  Unfortunately international forums have not made any 
comment! 
And, moreover, this is land and air aggression against state 
borders! What licence is there for that? Why do those who raise 
legal issues say nothing? Is the presence of an individual or a 
group in a third country, whose ideology is against the ideology 
of the system... [sentence as heard] Can that be a licence for 
aggression against a country's land and air frontiers? Why has 
the world kept silent? 
  Then, naturally, we see the recent air attacks, the 
bombarding of south Lebanon and the martyrdom of Muslims! 
  They think that with such acts the problem will be resolved. 
History has demonstrated, divine honor has demonstrated that 
problems cannot be resolved by those means. And we are certain 
that the area will not be calm until the day when the owners of 
that land, the true owners of Palestine, return to their homes. 
[crowd chants: "God is great"; "Khamene'i is the leader"; "Death 
to Israel"] 
  The last time I stood at this podium I told the British 
government that if it has any proof regrading its claim let it 
be given to us for investigation. So far, not only have they 
had no proof and have not shown anything, but they have also 
embarked on other action which follows those hegemonist ideas. 
In short, I tell the British government that that method has 
become old-fashioned now; the actions you have embarked upon are 
not right. Mend your ways. The Islamic Republic of Iran has 
demonstrated in practice that it always seeks a peaceful 
existence and will never be willing -- despite your behavior -- 
to embark on actions which are beneath its dignity; even in 
retaliation. 
  We really say to Afghanistan that it is enough; don't ruin 
the country any further. 
  We say to some Arab countries which agitate that the Islamic 
Republic of Iran is not in a situation where it can be affected 
by such provocation. This government, which has such an alert 
and vigilant people, is in control of all its aspects and will 
not allow any power, either in the farthest region of the world 
or in its nearest neighborhood, to attempt the slightest 
violation against its independence. [crowd chants: "God is 
great"; "Khamene'i is the leader"; "death to 
antirevolutionaries"; "Death to Israel"] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Arabic Friday prayers sermon by Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, </F>
head of the judiciary, on 3 June; place not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
Muslim brothers and sisters all over the world, a quick glance 
at the situation of the Islamic countries, the governments 
dominating them, international relations, and the big powers' 
treatment of the Muslims, particularly the Third World 
countries, raises a question. The question is: Has this 
situation been caused by Islam and the divine system and 
teachings or because of Muslims' conduct, most of which is not 
acceptable to Islam? 
  The propaganda of Islam's enemies openly attributes this to 
Islam and says that Islam is the cause of the backwardness and 
degradation at intellectual, cultural, and industrial levels of 
these countries that have been controlled by foreigners. But 
examining the Islamic intellectual resources and practical 
conduct of the noble Prophet and the infallible imams, 
salutations be upon them, clearly indicates that this is 
propaganda from the arrogant powers' agents who have infiltrated 
and affected the Muslims' thinking. It has even infiltrated and 
affected leaders and clergymen who believed that Islam, like 
Christianity, has no effect on worldly affairs, politics, and 
social life and that Muslims should turn to worship and not 
interfere with political and social issues. 
  This is what has created a favorable atmosphere for the 
foreigners' hegemony. Islam is the religion of both this world 
and the world hereafter, the religion of politics and 
administration, the religion of independence and freedom far 
from the foreigners' domination. Turning the reigns of power 
over to infidels, polytheists, and foreigners is a great sin. 
We believe that Muslims should know Islam well and realize its 
truth. Had the Muslim countries realized the true Islam, Islam 
would have dominated the government and (?judiciary) and rulers 
would have been compelled to keep in line with Islam and Muslims 
or relinquish power. Clashes being seen between governments and 
peoples in some Islamic countries form a picture of this 
phenomenon. Had this been the case, Muslims would have realized 
that the rulers' behavior in these countries was not Islamic and 
would have naturally demanded that Islamic laws be respected. 
  The religion is one of politics, prudence, progress, 
independence, and freedom, not a religion of shackles, 
servility, and surrender to foreigners' hegemony. 
  Muslim brothers and sisters, this issue has proved that 
Islam 
passed the test of viability in the days of early Islam. Today 
our country has managed to rid itself of the foreigners' 
domination and establish an Islamic government amid Islam's laws 
under the leadership of the founder of the Islamic Republic in 
Iran, the late Imam Khomeyni. 
  Such a success cannot be achieved without the awareness of 
the public. We should explain the spirit of Islam more than 
before to restore to Islam its former strength in the hope that 
Islam and Muslims will achieve their desired strength and 
greatness so that Islamic rule will dominate the Muslims, God 
willing. I ask God's forgiveness for you and myself.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Four Items on Velayati's Agenda </F>
During His Visit to Baghdad"] 
  [Text] Tehran, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Tehran 
announced yesterday that Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar 
Velayati has accepted an invitation to visit Iraq early next 
month. 
  Velayati, who will be the first Iranian minister to visit 
Iraq since 1978, is expected to discuss "an important and deep 
change in bilateral relations," according to sources in Tehran. 
  The agenda will include four issues: 
  To achieve a phased settlement to the dispute over the Shatt 
al-'Arab waterway on the basis of the 1975 Algiers agreement. 
To coordinate to prevent the establishment of a 
semi-independent Kurdish state in north Iraq. Iran reached a 
separate agreement with Turkey on this issue, while Syria 
announced its commitment to Iraq's territorial integrity. To 
agree a joint policy against Washington, and the two sides will 
work to set up a broader grouping that could include Jordan, 
Yemen, Sudan, and Libya; it could also include Qatar. To embark 
on a joint economic action to ease the effects of the UN 
sanctions imposed on Iraq, without violating the Security 
Council resolutions. Iran is already allowing the delivery to 
Iraq of huge quantities of food supplies, medicine, and 
"durable" commodities through operations across the border. 
  But there are several sources of tension in relations 
between 
Tehran and Baghdad; most importantly, either side is financing 
and supporting the exiled groups opposed to the other. The 
arrest recently of two people in Tehran on the pretext that they 
are Iraqi intelligence officers is an indication that the two 
sides are continuing the hostile operations which were 
originally designed during the eight-year war between the two 
countries. 
  Iraq is sheltering and financing several Iranian opposition 
groups, including the Mojahedin-e Khalq, the Kurdish Democratic 
Party [of Iran], and several Baluch groups. While Iran is 
supporting Shiite Iraqi organizations fighting the Baghdad 
regime.

  [Text] Kabul, June 4 (AFP) -- Iran's deputy foreign 
minister, 'Ala'eddin Borujerdi, is to mediate while here between 
rival groups within the Afghan Shiite faction Hezb-i-Wahdat, 
party sources said Saturday. 
  A Foreign Ministry official here said Borujerdi arrived 
Friday for a five-day visit that will include meetings with 
Afghan leaders. 
  Borujerdi came amid an ongoing leadership dispute in Wahdat 
between incumbent 'Ali Mazari and his challenger Akbar 'Azimi, a 
former member of the party's central committee. 
  Sources in the Iranian-backed faction said the row, which 
triggered fighting between supporters of the two men late last 
month, had caused the indefinite postponement of plans to hold 
party elections. 
  Wahdat is loosely linked with an alliance fighting to 
overthrow Afghan President Borhanoddin Rabbani, which is made up 
mainly of Prime Minister Golboddin Hematyar's Hezb-e-Eslami and 
forces of the Uzbek warlord General 'Abdol Rashid Dostam. 
  Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have frequently urged the 
warring Afghan factions to settle their differences to end the 
five months of fighting that has left more than 2,500 dead and 
at least 17,000 injured. 
  Borujerdi has held talks with Rabbani and sources said he 
was 
due to travel to Hekmatyar's nearby base at Charasiab late 
Saturday to meet with the president's arch foe. 
  He may also meet in Kabul with former defence minister Ahmad 
Shah Mas'ud, Rabbani's strongman, the sources said. 
  According to the Foreign Ministry official, Pakistani 
Foreign 
Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali was expected to visit Kabul in 
the coming week.

  [Text] The first supply convoy arrived to Kabul today from 
Shir Khan Bandar. 
  A source in the 20th Jehadi Division of Baghlan Province 
reported to Bakhtar Information Agency that Shir Khan 
Bandar-Kabul supply route has been repaired and was opened to 
traffic through (Kotel-e Murgh). Esteemed Ahmad Shah Masud; and 
Esteemed Abdul Hay Haqjo, commander of the 20th Jehadi Division 
of Baghlan Province, accompanied by the high ranking 
representatives of the Islamic State of Afghanistan, watched the 
process of arrival of the supply convoy and transport vehicles 
which arrived from Shir Khan Bandar to Kabul and travelled from 
Kabul to Shir Khan Bandar via (Kotel-e Murgh). 
  Sayed Abdul Motaleb, official in charge of the repair and 
construction of this road said that the repair and construction 
of this road began two months ago with the cooperation of the 
government officials and the Muslim people of Andarab and 
(Neharin) districts and was completed recently. It is now 
opened to traffic with this first supply convoy to pass through. 
  A correspondent of Bakhtar Information Agency adds that the 
oppositions of the Islamic State of Afghanistan who are the 
enemies of our land and Muslim people, were using the economic 
blockade of Kabul city as a strong propaganda tool. The opening 
of the road between Kabul and Shir Khan Bandar, which connects 
Afghanistan with Tajikistan, in Central Asia, is a considerable 
victory for the Islamic State of Afghanistan in removing the 
economic blockade imposed by the oppositions of our country 
against our Muslim nation and is another obvious defeat for the 
opposition. 
  Once more supply convoys arrive to Kabul the price of food 
will come down and the economic problems of our country will 
become relatively less.

  Preparations have been made for return home of some 300,000 
more Afghan refugees this year, Husseini told IRNA. 
  Husseini said that according to the policies of the Islamic 
Republic, those Afghan refugees who have received identification 
cards may stay in Iran as long as they wish.

  [Text] Islamabad -- Pakistan said Saturday [4 June] that 
by test-firing its short-range ballistic missile India has 
unleashed a race of sophisticated weapons in South Asia. 
  The Pakistani reaction came hours after India test-fired 
Prithvi, which can carry a payload of one ton up to 190 km (150 
miles), in the bay of Bengal. 
  "By test-firing the missile India has brought all major 
Pakistani cities, except the southern most city of Quetta, under 
its range," said Munir Akram, a spokesman for the Pakistan 
Foreign Office. 
  He said India was also looking for locations to test-fire 
the 
medium range Agni missile which can carry a payload of one ton 
up to 2,400 km. 
  On his return from a visit to the United States on Friday 
president Farooq Leghari told reporters that he has conveyed 
Pakistan's concerns to the US administration over India's 
efforts to deploy medium- and short-range missiles in the region. 
  "It is a new phase in the arms race in South Asia. It will 
now unleash a missile race in the region," said Akram. 
  The deployment of these missiles, according to him, will 
shorten the warning time of any surprise attack against Pakistan 
down to a few minutes "and, therefore, increase the hair-trigger 
environment in South Asia". 
  He said Pakistan has advised all countries concerned, 
especially the members of the Missile Technology control Regime, 
to urge India not to go ahead with the development and 
deployment of these missiles. 
  He said Pakistan had so far been talking to the United 
States 
and had established no direct contact with India over the matter 
"but we will consider other diplomatic options as well".

  [Text] A Foreign Office spokesman in Islamabad today 
expressed Pakistan's serious concern over the final trial launch 
of the Prithvi missile by India. He said if India proceeds with 
the deployment, a qualitatively new threat will be posed to 
Pakistan's security. It will lead inevitably to a missile race 
in South Asia and accentuate the danger of nuclear arms 
proliferation in this region. 
  The spokesman said Pakistan has repeatedly warned the 
international community that India's deployment of missiles 
threatens nuclear arms race and destabilizes the South Asian 
region. It would also threaten all the countries of the Gulf, 
Central Asia, China and parts of Southeast Asia, evoking 
defensive responses and eroding stability. The spokesman called 
upon the international community, especially the members of the 
Missile Technology Control Regime, to prevent India from 
crossing a critical and possibly irrevocable threshold through 
the deployment of the Prithvi missile.

Nations peacekeeping mission in the war-torn Muslim country. 
The third group of troops is expected to leave within a 
fortnight. These groups are scheduled to undergo requisite 
training in the Slovak Republic for a period of two weeks and

auspices of the United Nations. The remaining troops of the main 
body will be flown directly to Bosnia under a phased program

  [Text] Islamabad -- Pakistan government has no intentions 
of dramatically increasing its defence budget for the next 
financial year, highly placed government sources told this 
correspondent on Saturday. 
  "We have no intention of increasing the defence budget in 
real terms. 
  This should not be taken to mean that we do not take the 
country's defence requirements seriously but we cannot afford to 
be irresponsible with our finance," these sources said. 
  Experts were expecting a heavy raise in Pakistan's defence 
budget this year, after India increased its defence spending by 
a whooping 29 per cent in its budget for fiscal 1994-95, 
starting April 1, 1994. 
  "The extraordinary increase by India is basically a strategy 
to preserve a deterrent. However, unlike India we do not have 
the kind of resources to give such a massive raise in the 
defence budget," noted the source. 
  Islamabad has been applying a cut in real terms, that is 
after discounting inflation, on defence spending for the last 
three years. 
  In the Federal Budget for fiscal 1993-94, defence spending 
claimed Rs 89.1 billion [rupees] or about a third of the total 
budgeted expenditure. This was about two per cent increase over 
the previous year's revised estimate of Rs 87.4 billion.

<F P=106> [Report by Umer Farooq] </F>
  [Text] Islamabad -- In a letter addressed to Prime Minister 
[PM] Benazir Bhutto, leader of the opposition Nawaz Sharif has 
expressed his inability to meet her on June 5. 
  The prime minister had invited the leader of the opposition 
to tea to discuss the current economic situation in the country. 
It was proposed by the PM that the government would take the 
opposition into confidence regarding the steps to be taken in 
the forthcoming budget. 
  Nawaz Sharif turning down Bhutto's offer has proposed to 
send 
two of his colleagues instead to attend the pre-budget briefing. 
  The leader of the opposition in his letter has also proposed 
to discuss vital issues of national importance like Kashmir, 
nuclear programme and price hike on the floor of the House. 
  Following is the text of Nawaz Sharifs letter: 
  "Dear Prime Minister, I wish to acknowledge receipt of your 
letter of May 29, 1994, inviting me for tea on June 5 for a 
discussion on the current economic situation. 
  While thanking you for your invitation, I will be unable to 
attend personally, but will be happy to send one or two of my 
colleagues to attend the proposed pre-budget briefing. 
  In the context of your invitation to the leader of the 
opposition for a discussion on economic issues. I do wish to 
express some views on the relations between the government and 
the opposition. 
  First, I find a wide gap, which is sadly increasing between 
your pronouncements and your practices. For instance, I am 
being invited for tea at a time where your government's 
vilification and victimisation of the opposition has reached new 
heights. Our government in NWFP [North-West Frontier Province] 
was destabilised through illegal means in a bid to capture total 
power in the country. The leaders and workers of PML [Pakistan 
Muslim League] and its allied parties are being victimised and 
subjected to the worst form of vilification at the hands of the 
PPP [Pakistan People's Party]-controlled official and electronic 
media. 
  Second, as I stated in your presence in my speech of the 
National Assembly on October 19, 1993, my role and that of my 
party remains one of an issue-oriented opposition engaged in 
constructive criticism of official policies in the larger 
national interest. 
  I hope you would agree with me that the current security and 
economic situation in the country is too grave to leave much 
room for scoring political points which seems to be your 
government's primary endeavour vis-a-vis the opposition. I am 
ready to discuss issues of vital national interest like Kashmir, 
the nuclear question and the price hike in the National 
Assembly, since, it is most suitable and representative forum 
for such discussions". 
  Sincerely, 
  (Signed) Mohammad Nawaz Sharif.

  [Text] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has said 
she is disappointed to learn that the leader of the opposition 
is unable to accept her invitation for June 5 to take him into 
confidence about the current economic situation and the measures 
needed to give economic stability to the country. In a letter 
to Mr. Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister said she had made the 
invitation in good faith and in the greater national interests. 
In her letter, she said a democratic government always works 
within constitutional framework. The last elections were the 
fairest since 1977 and its verdict has been acceptable to all. 
As regards your concerns about the NWFP [North-West Frontier 
Province] assembly and other matters, she hoped you will seek 
relief through the courts of law or other constitutional 
mechanism available. It would be best for both of us to accept 
constitutional realities which cannot be subjected to political 
pressures. In view of your inability, I have directed the 
minister for finance to hold a meeting with your representative 
tomorrow at 0500 at the Q Block for this purpose.

  [Text] Describing his visit to the United States as 
satisfactory, the president [Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari] said it 
was timely and significant. The president, who returned to 
Islamabad today after this two-week visit to the United States 
and France was addressing a news conference at the Aiwan-i-Sadar 
[President House] this evening. 
  [Begin Leghari recording] I would like to reiterate my 
satisfaction with the outcome of the visit which was timely and 
significant. At this stage of flux in international political 
and economic relations, the U.S. Administration and corporate 
America are considering the future directions of their policies 
toward our region. My visit was a crucial opportunity to 
present our viewpoints, try, and influence these decisions. It 
must be recognized, however, that building a new relationship 
with the U.S. in the post cold war era will be a poser. It 
cannot be realized in one visit or at one time. My visit to the 
U.S., I hope, will be judged by history as having promoted 
Pakistan's security and prosperity and as forming a bridge 
between our post cold war ties with the U.S. and the new 
relationship which is responsive to the challenges and 
opportunities of the emerging era in international affairs. 
[end recording] 
  President Farooq Leghari said during his stay in the United 
States, he met with the Vice President Al Gore. The U.S. 
Secretary of State, Mr. Warren Christopher, and Deputy Secretary 
of State Mr. Talbott called on him and he held a series of 
meetings with other American officials and legislators as well 
as IMF and World Bank leaders and heads of various financial 
institutions. He said in his talks with the U.S. leaders it was 
agreed that the two countries would try to overcome the hurdle 
posed by the Pressler Amendment through a process of diplomatic 
consultation. The first round of such consultations was held in 
Washington by Pakistan and American officials on 26th and 27th 
May. These discussions were constructive and will continue. 
The president said Pakistan was also assured that the United 
States will remain fully engaged in promoting security in South 
Asia. Washington, he added, is well aware of the danger of the 
missile race, if India continues the development of its missile 
program and in particular, if it goes ahead with the deployment 
of the short range Prithvi. The president said he pointed out 
that the Agni with a range of 2400 km will pose a threat to a 
number of countries in our region. President Leghari said the 
United States acknowledged that Kashmir remains a threat to 
regional and international peace. Pakistan, he added, has 
conveyed its willingness to resume talks with India on Kashmir 
and other subjects once New Delhi takes some steps to create 
propitious conditions for such talks. 
  Pakistan and the United States also agreed to promote 
conventional arms control and more effective confidence-building 
measures by India and Pakistan. The president said the most 
exciting possibilities for future relations between Pakistan and 
the United States lie in areas of investment and business 
collaboration. In his meeting, he said there was clear 
recognition that Pakistan has now achieved both political and 
macroeconomic stability. The coming of age of democracy in 
Pakistan accompanied by the steps of the present government in 
reducing the budget deficit, in lowering inflation, and in 
deepening the economic reforms program has created a most 
propitious climate for both domestic and foreign investment in 
Pakistan's economy. The president said the IMF, the World Bank, 
and IFC [International Finance Corporation] have indicated 
clearly that Pakistan's economic environment is appropriate for 
investment, particularly in the energy sector. He said, in his 
opinion, Pakistan is likely to attract investment of over $2 
billion annually in the coming years. 
  The president said on his way back, he made a stopover in 
Paris where he met President Mitterrand. During the course of 
the meeting, various steps to promote bilateral relations 
between the two countries were discussed. 
  Replying to a number of questions about the allegations 
leveled by the leader of the opposition implicating Mr. Leghari 
in the Mehran Bank scandal, the president rejected all the 
charges as preposterous and without an iota of truth. His 
political life is like an open book and the question of his 
involvement in any scandal does not arise at all. I have never 
been associated with any of the scandals, he asserted. The 
president said he will initiate legal proceedings against all 
those who are resorting to a campaign of character assassination 
against him. He said the fact of the matter is that he and 
other members of his family have sold 531 acres of ancestral 
land to six individuals belonging to Karachi. The payment of 
this land was made through Mehran Bank. He said those who are 
hurling allegations against him may not be aware of the fact. 
Mr. Farooq Ahmad Leghari said it cannot be justified to level 
baseless charges against the president of Pakistan. 
  Replying to another question, the president said there is a 
consensus on issues like Kashmir, nuclear program, security of 
the country and basic economic policies. However, he said, it 
is unfortunate that certain elements are out to tell the world 
that no consensus exists on these issues.

  [Text] Amman, June 5 (AFP) -- Jordan is ready to sign an 
accord with Israel on defining their common border, a senior 
Jordanian official told AFP on Sunday. 
  Jordan "is determined to recover territory occupied by 
Israel 
and will not hesitate to sign a bilateral accord on this issue 
with the Hebrew state before there is a peace treaty," the 
official said on condition he not be named. 
  Israel and Jordan are due to meet in Washington on Monday to 
discuss the border issue which dates back to 1922 and the 
outlines drawn up during the British mandate over Palestine. 
  Jordan is claiming from Israel a strip of about 320 square 
kilometres (128 square miles) along their border from the Gulf 
of Aqaba to the Dead Sea, as well as 1.3 square kilometres (half 
a square mile) south of Lake Tiberias in the Jordan Valley. 
  Jordan has so far refused to sign a separate peace treaty 
with Israel before all outstanding issues have been resolved, 
and until there is a comprehensive settlement with other Arab 
countries. 
  The official said that any such accord on their common 
border 
"would not prejudice our commitment to a global peace" 
settlement, but added that the "return of our territories is the 
top priority." 
  So far Israel has evaded any mention of the border issue in 
bilateral talks. 
  But Jordanian Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani told 
reporters Saturday that Jordan had received signs that Israel 
"was ready to discuss these border questions." 
  A Foreign Ministry spokesman in Jerusalem confirmed that the 
two delegations were to meet Monday in Washington to discuss the 
border dispute. 
  Bilateral Arab-Israeli talks have been suspended since a 
Jewish settler killed 30 Arab worshippers in a mosque in Hebron 
on February 25.

that Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat is expected in Amman 
tomorrow, Monday, for talks with His Majesty King Husayn and 
senior officials. 
  Sources say that discussions will center on effective joint 
coordination and the declaration by the Palestinian side that 
they have agreed to Jordanian proposals pertaining to the plan 
of action related to the Joint Economic Agreement. 
  The sources further say that during his stay in Amman, 
'Arafat is expected to undergo medical checkups to ascertain 
that his health condition is stable. However, the sources say 
that this will depend on whether or not he will have enough time 
to spare and provided nothing new is added to his heavy schedule 
in the wake of preparations for his visiting the autonomous 
region next week.

  [Text] In a special session with the Speaker and members 
of the House of Representatives in the Pictures Hall at the 
parliament building today, Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam 
al-Majali reviewed a number of national and foreign issues. Dr. 
al-Majali also spoke about where the government stood on 
regional developments. 
  House Speaker Tahir al-Masri, told journalists after the 
meeting that one of the topics that figured prominently at the 
session was the Jordanian-Palestinian relationship. The prime 
minister, said al-Masri, underscored the importance of these 
ties and Jordan's keenness to maintain coordination that 
advances, first, the Palestinian cause and the new Palestinian 
situation and, second, the interests of the two countries. 
  The prime minister said the present level of coordination 
fell short of expectations and has not been as effective as we 
would have liked. The prime minister, added al-Masri, stressed 
that Jordan was committed to a role of support for the 
Palestinian cause, no matter what the obstacles, and free from 
any ambitions or any attempt to dominate. 
  The prime minister, according to al-Masri, had paid tribute 
to Jordanian-Egyptian relations. He emphasized that the 
meetings of the Higher Jordanian-Egyptian Committee had helped 
solidify these ties. Relations with Syria also have a special 
significance, given that the two countries' stands were similar 
and complementary on the negotiations and the potential for 
bilateral and regional cooperation. 
  The prime minister also said at the session that Jordan 
stood 
for a halt to fighting in brotherly Yemen and a hands-off 
policy. Jordan was against taking sides and for legitimacy and 
unity. Al- Masri further noted that the prime minister had 
vigorously denied 'Ali Salim al-Bid's contention that Jordan was 
extending assistance to the Yemeni Government in Sanaa. He 
regretted that such an unjust charge should have been made by 
al-Bid against Jordan, which had given his majesty the king a 
mandate to take whatever measures he deemed would advance 
Yemen's unity. All that Jordan did was to airlift Jordanian and 
other nationals from Yemen on purely humanitarian grounds to 
spare them the risks involved in a war situation, explained the 
house speaker. 
  The prime minister, went on al-Masri, reported to the 
deputies on the state of the negotiations between Jordan and 
Israel and the agenda of the meeting to be held in Washington 
tomorrow. He stressed that Jordan adheres to its declared 
constants. There will not be a separate deal on the Jordanian 
front, the prime minister was quoted as emphasizing by the house 
speaker.

<F P=106> [Report by Randah Habib in Amman] </F>
  [Text] Jordanian Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali has 
categorically denied Aden's accusation that Jordan is sending 
weapons to Sanaa, saying that the accusation conflicts with 
Jordan's support for dialogue in Yemen. Al-Majali asserted that 
Jordan has never thought of sending weapons to any side in Yemen 
and reiterated that Jordan does not support one side against the 
other, and that it opposes infighting and believes in dialogue 
to resolve the bloody crisis in that country. 
  Al-Majli also said that Jordan supports unity and legitimacy 
in Yemen, that the unity was carried out as a result of the 
Yemeni people's decision, and that Jordan will continue to 
believe in that unless the Yemeni people want otherwise. 
  With regard to planes, al-Majali said that Amman had sent 
Royal Jordanian aircraft, and C-130 transportation planes to 
evacuate its nationals from Yemen, as well as other European and 
Asian nationals on humanitarian grounds, and that these aircraft 
carried nothing other than passengers.

  [Text] Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of state for Cabinet 
Affairs and information minister, has denied reports that Jordan 
shipped weapons to Yemen. He said the current fighting there is 
a purely internal affair. He also said that Jordan believes in 
legitimacy as chosen by the Yemeni people and that when it 
mediated among the brothers in Yemen it did so at the clear 
request of all parties. 
  Reacting to statements by some Yemeni Socialist Party 
officials who alleged that Jordan shipped weapons and military 
equipment to Yemen on board military aircraft, Dr. al-'Anani 
said: Jordan sent civilian aircraft to Yemen to evacuate 
Jordanian expatriates home after it became impossible for them 
to stay there because of the fighting and the eruption of fierce 
battles. At the same time, Jordan also used these aircraft to 
evacuate many citizens, families, and children from fraternal 
Arab and friendly foreign communities. Jordan was the only 
country to fulfill such a humanitarian role. 
  The minister explained that because of the high insurance 
rate -- $500,000 --levied on civilian flights to fraternal 
Yemen, Jordan had to use and send C-130 military aircraft to 
rescue innocent civilians and evacuate Jordanians working in 
Yemen, as well as other nationals of brotherly and friendly 
states. He said: These aircraft were the only way to evacuate 
them and carry them back to the homeland. These flights were 
made in public and in full sight of all countries in the world, 
and in the presence of local, Arab, and foreign journalists. 
  Dr. al-'Anani said it is not unusual or new for Jordan to 
engage in such humanitarian actions. Jordan has done this 
before, during the Gulf crisis when it received and hosted on 
its territory more than 1 million people, he added. 
  The minister said he hopes the crisis in fraternal Yemen 
will 
end and the shedding of innocent blood among the brothers will 
stop, for the benefit and interests of the Yemeni Arab people 
and for the interests of the sons of the Arab nation.

<F P=106> [From "News at Ten" program] </F>
  [Text] Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani categorically 
denied reports that Jordan is providing Yemen with weapons and 
spare parts. Dr. al-'Anani was reacting to a statement in Cairo 
by the prime minister of South Yemen's secessionist government, 
Haydar Abu- Bakr al-'Attas, accusing Jordan and Iraq of 
providing the north with military spare parts. The information 
minister said Jordan views the current fighting in Yemen as an 
internal affair and that the accusations were baseless. 
  [Begin recording] [Al-'Anani] Well, first of all, as far as 
Iraq is concerned, Iraq is being closely monitored especially in 
the field of arms. So, as far as that score is concerned, I 
think it's not correct, and I am sure it's not correct. 
  As far as Jordan is concerned, the only transportation we 
had 
to Yemen was when the internal war took place. Jordan was among 
the very few countries, and eventually the only country, which 
dared send planes, first of all civilian planes, to rescue 
people from the war zone and bring them back -- Jordanian 
families and children, and then Arab nationals, and then even 
peoples from third countries. We did that on our own risk. The 
planes which went there were civilian planes. We had to pay at 
a certain time an insurance policy, noncommercial insurance 
policy, amounting to half a million dollars per trip, which is 
an exorbitant amount to pay. Then we replaced that by empty 
planes that brought people back, military planes that brought, 
which came back full of people and luggage. And those were 
witnessed by many people, they were under cameras and monitored 
and so on. 
  I really don't see where such a claim came. Maybe, it could 
be as a result of Jordan's position as far as believing that 
legitimacy and legality should prevail in Yemen because Yemen 
right now is a sovereign country that has developed its own 
institutions through a constitutional process, elections, and so 
on and so forth. It is true that the institutional structure 
was not yet completed, but we had a state that was acknowledged 
by the international community. Therefore, I don't think that we 
should mix positions of Jordan, which stem from its strong 
adherence to international law and to internal integrity of each 
sovereign state in the world, with the fact that Jordan, which 
was invited by both warring factions in Yemen to reconciliate 
between them. [sentence as heard] They came to Jordan, they 
asked Jordan for that role, which we did with the help of other 
Arab countries, now to be accused that it is really fuelling the 
war that is going on when we abhor bloodshed, and we don't like 
it. 
  [Correspondent Murid Hammad] Some say that this is the price 
that Jordan will again have to pay for standing up in favor of 
Arab unity and national reconciliation. Do you agree with that? 
  [Al-'Anani] I agree that Jordan has paid a heavy price for 
such positions and maybe Yemen will prove to be another example.

<F P=106> [Report by Salim 'Ali Dhiyab on news conference held by Dr. </F>
Jawad al-'Anani, minister of information and minister of state 
for cabinet affairs, with unidentified correspondents in Amman 
on 4 June] 
  [Text] [Dhiyab] Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of 
information and minister of state for cabinet affairs, held a 
news conference today in which he elaborated on the issues and 
topics raised during today's cabinet meeting. He also spoke 
about the government's interest in improving employees' general 
performance and conditions. 
  [Begin Al-'Anani recording] His Majesty King Husayn conveyed 
to the Council of Ministers the message about the need to work 
to consolidate the domestic Jordanian front and to emphasize 
improving performance in all sectors, including the 
administrative sector. This is in order to provide citizens with 
the best services, encourage the private sector to play its 
investment role, and reduce all manifestations of red tape and 
administrative obstacles discouraging Jordanian, Arab, and world 
investment. Foreign investment must satisfy our requirements so 
that, God willing, Jordan will remain economically invincible. 
His Majesty King Husayn also continually reaffirms the basic 
fact that Jordanian citizens of various origins and descents are 
Jordanian nationals, equal in rights and duties, and that 
Jordanian ranks must always remain invincible and integrated. 
His majesty also reiterated that plurality in Jordanian society 
must be a source of unity and strength, rather than a source of 
fragmentation, God forbid. His majesty also stressed that at 
this particular critical stage, Jordan must basically depend on 
itself and its own resources, immunity, and capabilities so as 
to prevent any penetration, God forbid. The present stage is 
one requiring very delicate decisions. This is because we must 
always compare what is taking place with our objectives and 
aspirations. We do not give up our stands, but this does not 
mean that we will remain static and immobile if developments 
warrant otherwise. 
  In fact, among the most important things that discussions 
dealt with today were the current peace negotiations. We 
currently notice that the peace process has begun to take a new 
direction. Its important and strategic role in the peace 
process notwithstanding, Jordan cannot agree to lag much behind 
other tracks. At the same time, Jordan is not showing 
breathlessness and hastiness. Jordan does not want to find 
itself, God forbid, in a position forcing it to adopt positions 
that it does not at all accept for itself. Yet, while we will 
not let hastiness lead us to unacceptable stands, we must not 
agree that negotiations are delayed and problems solved on other 
tracks in a way that leaves Jordan alone, subject to pressure. 
Nor do we agree that we keep on soliloquizing until the 
Jordanian role becomes marginal in the peace process. 
  Therefore, regarding the peace process, Jordan will take the 
steps which will enable it to maintain the reins of the 
initiative with respect to Jordanian affairs. Among the most 
important issues in this regard is the tripartite 
Jordanian-U.S.-Israeli meeting which will begin in Washington on 
Monday [6 June]. The main objective of this meeting is to 
discuss the future of the negotiations. 
  As you know, Jordan signed a joint agenda with Israel on 14 
September 1993, immediately after the Palestinian-Israeli 
Declaration of Principles was signed. This was done out of 
Jordan's support for the Palestinian negotiating position at 
that time. 
  In fact, the agenda we obtained was good, in the full sense 
of the word, because it preserves both Jordan's basic rights and 
the comprehensive solution. The agenda also addresses all 
issues raised at the negotiations table. Thus, in the 
negotiating process, Jordan basically follows the agenda it 
signed at that time. 
  We know that Jordan has basic issues pertaining to the 
negotiating process. These issues are currently led by the 
issue of borders, or the so-called occupied Jordanian territory, 
and also the need to proceed toward regaining it. This is 
because the agenda specified the principle to which we can refer 
in order to regain the Jordanian territory. As you know, the 
terms of reference on defining this territory are the mandate 
agreement of 1922. Thus, there should be an agreement under 
which Israel will be committed to both returning the Jordanian 
territory and accepting the setting up of an expert committee 
which would demarcate these borders as they used to be according 
to the mandate agreement. 
  Moreover, Jordan must demand its rights to water. This is 
because, as you know, water is a Jordanian right. According to 
Israel, regardless of dividing the water, its size would not be 
sufficient for the future, so instead of discussing the rights 
to water let us talk about both increasing the water resources 
and the regional cooperation on them. 
  We, in Jordan, however, believe that both issues are very 
important, so we will not relinquish our rights to water. 
Hence, we should complete what the water, energy, and 
environment group in the bilateral negotiations began in terms 
of discussing the subsidiary agenda of this group, so we can 
take steps later to regain our full rights to water. 
  Now, if something takes place in Washington confirming that 
the Israeli side is more prepared to demarcate the Jordanian 
borders according to the mandate agreement, and if we find out 
that they are ready to seriously discuss returning water rights 
to Jordan, the following logical question would be posed: What 
will our position be on such a basic development, which Jordan 
has been pushing to achieve since the beginning of the peace 
process? A clear answer to this question is that Jordan will 
not stand idly by and defer the regaining of its rights to both 
the territory and water in return for procedures or some forms 
of arrangements to hold negotiations on this issue. 
  It is clear that we cannot demarcate the borders and specify 
our water shares in Washington D.C. Hence, there should be an 
arrangement to move the negotiating process to this region, so 
we can be close to the decisionmakers, and the committees can 
meet on site in order to define both the Jordanian territory and 
Jordan's water share, which we deserve within this context. 
  Jordan has an unshakable belief that any settlement must be 
inclusive. That a settlement must be inclusive is not just a 
demand or slogan as far as Jordan is concerned. It must 
translate into practical steps on the ground. We very much want 
to see progress on the Syrian track. Obviously, the Golan 
Heights are Syrian territory that must all be handed back to 
Syria. Any Israeli withdrawal in return for any reciprocal 
measures that Syria may take will be viewed by us as sufficient 
to direct the peace process toward the eventual return of 
Syria's rights in the Golan. We are also aware that Israeli 
officials have said that they have no designs on Lebanese 
territory. Here in Jordan, we are vigorously behind the demand 
that the Lebanese Government regain sovereignty over its 
territories. We stand for the Lebanese Government 
reestablishing sovereignty on all the country's territories. 
  You are aware that there have been developments on the 
Palestinian track, and that the Gaza-Jerich accord was signed. 
Despite obstacles here and there, the Palestinian side is moving 
forward. 
  Jordan is seeking to coordinate at the highest levels. His 
Majesty King Husayn has said that the word coordination is 
gradually losing its meaning. Coordination means that the Arab 
parties involved in the peace process should coordinate their 
moves before they work out any agreement with the other side. 
This has been our practice all along, sharing our information 
with brothers. However, the required level of coordination is 
lacking. As things stand now, we compare notes after rather 
than before agreements are worked out. 
  Jordan is concerned about Arab integration; it cannot afford 
to be overtaken by events and left behind, lest its hands become 
tied and its movement toward its objectives be hindered, not 
only in terms of Jordanian rights, but also in terms of Arab 
rights, in the sense that the peace process must be 
comprehensive and peace itself durable. We, therefore, do not 
rush into taking hasty steps. We will take steps when the time 
is right so Jordan's role remains clear. This is because, as 
you know, any peace settlement in the region excluding Jordan 
will be incomplete. We do not want the strategic advantages 
that Jordan has acquired to be squandered or used as a way to 
pressure Jordan when it finds itself, under the prevailing 
deplorable Arab state of affairs, forced to accept whatever 
proposals it is offered. Therefore, to solidify Jordan's 
internal front and to move forward from the realm of economics, 
lest economics, as well as the debts, God forbid, be used as a 
means of pressure on us, we must improve the investment climate 
and our administration of investment. We must band together and 
give hardworking people more spacious room. Workers must be 
allowed to play their basic role in building the Jordanian state 
so as to satisfy our aspirations and those of his majesty, the 
supreme commander. [end recording] 
  [Dhiyab] Replying to a question about the war raging in 
Yemen, and where Jordan stands on the conflict, the minister 
said Jordan recognizes the Yemeni legitimacy that was approved 
by all the Yemeni parties after it was endorsed by the official 
and public Yemeni institutions. Asked about pay raises for 
civil servants that have been the subject of much talk in the 
press recently, Dr. al-'Anani said the Cabinet set up a 
commission to study the matter. A report submitted by the 
commission is under review. The Cabinet will discuss the matter 
at later sessions, al-'Anani added.

<F P=106> [Report on news conference held by Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, </F>
minister of information and minister of state for cabinet 
affairs, with unidentified correspondents in Amman on 4 June -- 
italicized passages recorded] 

    [Excerpts] [Announcer] Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of 
information and minister of state for cabinet affairs, held a 
news conference today in which he elaborated on the issues and 
topics raised during today's cabinet meeting. He also spoke 
about the government's interest to improve employees' general 
performance and conditions. 
  [Al-'Anani] [passage omitted] Regarding the prevailing 
Arab conditions, many of the brothers wonder, for example, about 
current developments in the Yemeni issue. As you know, at the 
request of the disputing Yemeni parties, the two parties came to 
Jordan about seven months ago and asked Jordan to mediate among 
the parties concerned. When Jordan mediated in the Yemeni 
issue, it did not do to impose its role, but was basically in 
response to the requests of our brothers in Yemen. Jordan cannot 
but accept the Yemeni legitimacy. This is because this 
legitimacy was not imposed by any Yemeni party on another party, 
but was the result of a purely internal Yemeni process in which 
the leaders of the north and south agreed to unite their 
country. They have also taken the necessary measures for this, 
including the amendment of the Yemeni Constitution and the 
holding of free elections in Yemen. This has given legitimacy 
to all Yemen through its recognized leadership which passed 
through all the constitutional and legal stages. Therefore, 
Jordan recognizes the Yemeni legitimacy which was approved by 
all the institutions of the Yemeni people, in accordance with 
which the Yemeni people adopted measures which led to the 
creation of the united Yemeni institutions. This process was 
basically continuing. Jordan will continue to be with the 
legitimacy in Yemen until something else is decided by an Arab 
consensus or anything else. But, for us, we do not fight 
anyone, we do not stand against anyone, and we do not have any 
political agenda in Yemen. However, we are with the legitimacy 
because this is an entrenched and basic Jordanian principle. We 
must not open the door for casting doubts on the legitimacy of 
states because this will be a precedent that could lead to bad 
consequences. 
  In the presence of his majesty the king, some ministers 
reviewed their various visits which you might know of. Dr. 
Sa'id al-Tall, deputy prime minister and minister of higher 
education, reviewed his visit to Syria and his meeting with 
President Hafiz al-Asad, who stressed the need for cooperation 
and integration with Jordan. At the same time, he emphasized 
his deep relationship with His Majesty King Husayn, and the need 
to upgrade the level of cooperation in the economic and 
political fields between the two countries to the highest 
possible level. The higher joint committee is expected to meet 
soon to discuss economic issues and other areas of cooperation, 
culture, youth, information, and education. 
  The interior minister also reviewed his visit to Iraq 
and his meeting with President Saddam Husayn, which came at the 
Iraqi leadership's request. In fact, the interior minister went 
there to discuss some issues related to the Jordanian nationals 
in Iraq. He found a great response from the Iraqi officials in 
this respect. 
  The minister of state for foreign affairs also reviewed 
his participation in the nonaligned foreign ministers' 
conference in Cairo, and his meetings with the officials there. 
The major point that was discussed was the future of the 
Nonaligned Movement, particularly following the changes in the 
balance of powers in the world which left the United States at 
the top of the pyramid of international power. It seems that 
the discussion has not led to very clear results toward which we 
can adopt a clear stand. Of course, this was an opportunity to 
meet with some Arab foreign ministers. I believe that the 
minister of state for foreign affairs spoke about this after his 
return. 
  We also listened to a report by the telecommunications 
minister, who attended the second phase of ARABSAT, and the 
meeting of the ARABSAT board of directors. The reason which led 
to the stumbling of this project, particularly the second phase 
of it, was that the launching of Ariane, the French missile, was 
not successful. It was supposed to carry a new Arab station. 
In this regard, we have instructions from his majesty the king 
to cooperate with the fraternal Arab states in the field of 
telecommunications, and to develop Jordan's abilities in the 
field of telecommunications, television transmission, and 
cooperation with the Arab states in this regard. 
  These are almost the most important points that were 
discussed today. 
  [Announcer] Dr. Jawad al-'Anani then answered 
correspondents' questions. Concerning the border issue and 
Israel's seriousness to discuss this issue in detail, he said: 
  [Al-'Anani] In fact, the Israeli side has expressed its 
readiness to discuss this issue within the so-called working 
group on security, border, and territories. Therefore, a 
Jordanian team and an Israeli team will discuss this issue. If 
an agreement is reached, then it will be necessary to discuss it 
on the border site in the region in order to be settled, and so 
that demarcation and the appropriate measures can be taken. 
  [Correspondent] [Passage Indistinct]. 
  [Al-'Anani] (?There will be) a tripartite committee 
meeting to discuss the issues related to the Palestinian-Israeli 
economic agreement and its effects on us, particularly in the 
field of trade and banks. There will also be a meeting to 
demarcate borders and to set a program to develop the Jordan 
Valley area, with all its dimensions. This is to prepare for 
future studies to discuss these issues and to emphasize that 
these issues cannot take place unless border problems are 
resolved. In the past, the U.S. stand was in agreement with 
this idea, and the Israeli stand was hesitant. Now, it seems, I 
say it seems, but we are not sure until we sit, negotiate, and 
know their reactions--but it seems that as long as they are 
ready to discuss, and we are always ready to discuss our rights, 
there might be something which makes us say that some change has 
occurred in the Israeli stand in this regard. 
  [Announcer] Concerning the employees' pay increase, Dr. 
al-'Anani said: 
  [Al-'Anani] The Council of Ministers is still 
discussing this issue with all seriousness. A ministerial 
committee has discussed this and approved some principles. The 
Council of Ministers today began discussions on it, but it has 
not yet completed the discussion. We hope to be able to 
complete discussion on this issue during the next Council of 
Ministers' meeting. 
  [Correspondent] [Passage indistinct] 
  [Al-'Anani] No, no, the overall picture is clear, but 
there are attempts to improve the draft plan. As you know, the 
draft plan was set by a ministerial committee, and the Council 
of Ministers must express its opinion about the ministerial 
committee's proposals. There are some ideas either by some 
specialized sectors, or in the overall picture. 
  [Announcer] On the date set for His Majesty King Husayn's 
visit to Washington, the information minister and minister of 
state for cabinet affairs, said: 
  [Al-'Anani] His Majesty King Husayn's visit to 
Washington will take place during the first half of this month, 
June. His Majesty King Husayn will go to have a regular medical 
checkup. This is to let people know. After His Majesty King 
Husayn underwent surgery at the Mayo Clinic, he was supposed to 
have a medical checkup every six months. This is the last 
semiannual medical checkup. This, God willing, will confirm 
that His Majesty King Husayn's health is as good as usual, and 
then the medical checkup will be done annually. This is 
something normal, a routine medical checkup. His Majesty King 
Husayn's health is very good, and we must be happy and 
congratulate ourselves on this. 
  His Majesty King Husayn will, of course, visit the 
United States, where he will meet with President Bill Clinton, 
Christopher, and senior U.S. officials. They will discuss the 
peace process, bilateral relations, developments in the region, 
and other issues. As you know, these issues appear to be 
repetitive, but every time, due to the rapid changes and 
developments, they gain new dimensions. Thank you very much.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Ayman al-Safadi] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Even though Jordan supports economic 
integration among Arab states, no concrete steps have been taken 
to form an economic alliance grouping the Kingdom with Syria and 
Lebanon, informed sources said Friday. 
  "Economic integration is a Jordanian requirement, but the 
Kingdom will not enter into economic or political groupings 
before preparing solid foundations for them first," said a 
source close to the government and the Royal court. 
  Agence France Press reported Thursday that Jordan, Syria and 
Lebanon had been discussing the formation of an economic 
cooperation council similar to the now defunct Arab Cooperation 
Council (ACC) which grouped Jordan, Egypt, Yemen and Iraq. The 
ACC, which reportedly antagonised some Gulf states, collapsed 
immediately after the eruption of the Gulf crisis in 1990. 
  The agency quoted unidentified political sources in Jordan 
as 
saying the proposed alliance would aim at "countering the 
repercussions of the Palestinian-Israeli economic agreement" on 
the economies of the three countries. 
  The Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) signed an 
economic agreement with Israel in Paris in April and the deal 
was ill-received by Syria and Lebanon and invited the 
condemnation of some economic experts in Jordan. 
  Jordan's past experiences with regional alliances rendered 
it 
cautious when discussing the formation of such groupings, the 
source said. The source said the formation of the council was 
floated by Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz who was 
briefed by Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Birri on 
discussions the latter held on the issue with Jordanian 
parliamentarians during his visit here last month. 
  But the discussion with Mr. Birri did not go beyond the 
expression of some Jordanian parliamentarians of their belief in 
the viability of economic cooperation with Lebanon, sources said. 
  Other informed sources said Syria had floated the issue with 
the Kingdom recently, but Jordan reiterated its position that 
solid groundwork had to be carried out before translating such 
ideas into reality. 
  "How could you have economic integration with Syria which 
does not have an ambassador in Jordan yet and where Jordanian 
television transmission is jammed?" the source said. 
  "Syria still has strong ties with allies who would not 
support such a project," said the source in reference to Gulf 
states which worked against the Arab Cooperation Council. 
  "But since the intention is there, technical committees 
could 
start working to discuss practical steps for realising the 
grouping," said the source, pointing out that Jordan believes in 
joint Arab action not only on the economic arena but also on the 
security and political ones. 
  The source said that economic integration with Syria and 
Lebanon would be governed by regional and international politics 
and Jordan is aware of the limit to which Arab-Arab relations 
could go. 
  Jordan and Syria took large steps towards economic 
integration in the late 1970s but the Kingdom was then punished 
by neighbouring countries which stopped their aid to the Kingdom 
in anger, the source said. 
  "Neither Jordan nor Syria believe in taking short cuts" in 
implementing projects of such magnitude, added the source. 
  The joint Jordanian-Syrian Higher Committee will hold talks 
on economic cooperation in Amman on Monday. In addition to 
Syrian Prime Minister Mahmud al-Zu'bi, Foreign Minister Faruq 
al-Shar' will attend the meeting in what was seen as an 
indication of the political significance that the talks would 
have. 
  Sources said it is possible that ways of dealing with the 
economic impact of the PLO-Israel deal on the two countries 
could be discussed during the meeting, but they will not amount 
to discussing the formation of an economic alliance.

<F P=106> [Report by Sa'd al-Silawi] </F>
  [Text] Industry and Trade Minister Dr. Rima Khalaf has said 
that Jordan's rapprochement and cooperation with all Arab 
countries does not mean that it wants to confront or work 
against any party, especially the Palestinian economy. 
  She said: We will cooperate with the Palestinian economy and 
always work for its growth and development, based on Jordan's 
historical commitment to the Palestine question. I do not think 
that any Jordanian citizen or official is doing anything other 
than this. 
  In an exclusive statement to AL-RA'Y commenting on reports 
about a desire to establish economic integration between Jordan, 
Syria, and Lebanon to confront the results of the economic 
agreement between Israel and the PLO on the economies of the 
three countries, Dr. Khalaf said: We are aware that there are 
restrictions on the Palestinian economy, and we hope that these 
restrictions will be removed so that this economy can become 
close and attached to the economies of Arab countries, and 
disengage its links with the Israeli economy. 
  Dr. Khalaf said Jordan's economic cooperation with all Arab 
countries is based on Jordan's historical pan-Arab concept, and 
this is not restricted to Syria and Lebanon but includes all 
Arab countries in order to realize Arab economic integration. 
  Dr. Khalaf said Jordan is following a policy of entrenching 
economic cooperation with all Arab countries, including the 
Palestinian National Authority. She added that, according to 
Jordan's concept, this cooperation will surely be beneficial and 
will assist economic and social development in all Arab 
countries. 
  Dr. Khalaf said Jordan wants to entrench economic 
cooperation 
with all Arab countries through joint committees, adding that 
the Jordanian-Syrian Joint Committee held a meeting in Amman, 
and will hold another meeting soon in Amman at the level of 
prime ministers. Before that, the Jordanian-Egyptian Joint 
Committee held meetings at the level of prime ministers. 
  She added that Jordan coordinates in all fields with Arab 
brothers in a bid to build an Arab economy that is able to 
survive and face the economic blocs set up in the world.

  [Text] Jerusalem, June 6 (AFP) -- Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres disclosed Monday [6 June] that he had pledged in a 
"secret" letter to PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat to maintain the 
status quo in Jerusalem and paved the way for him to pray in the 
holy city. 
  Peres said he undertook to allow Palestinian institutions 
which were in Jerusalem before the signing of the autonomy 
agreement last September to remain. 
  "The letter does not given any commitment about Palestinian 
institutions established in the city after the signing," Peres 
told reporters. 
  He stressed that the new Palestinian self-rule authority 
would have to set up all its bodies in the autonomous areas of 
Jericho and the Gaza Strip. 
  The full text would be published later Monday. 
  "It's a letter which has been blown out of proportion," said 
Peres, who has previously denied the existence of such a missive. 
  A senior foreign ministry official said the letter was sent 
to his Norwegian counterpart Johan Jorgen Holst last October 13 
and it was passed to 'Arafat. 
  Peres wrote that Israel would "refrain from any action which 
would restrict freedom of religion or restrict access to the 
holy sites," said the official who refused to be named. 
  "The undertaking concerns those who live in the city and 
visitors of the holy sites," the official added. 
  The letter clearly opens the way for 'Arafat to pray at the 
Dome of the Rock, which Moslems consider their third holiest 
site. 
  Peres also underlined that Jerusalem would be one of the 
subjects for negotiations when talks on a permanent settlement 
for the Palestinians start after two years of autonomy. 
  "Israel has always understood the importance and religious 
significance of Jerusalem for the monotheistic beliefs and will 
continue to respect the unique value of the city for Jews, 
Christians and Moslems," Peres wrote. 
  The official said the missive was intended to remain secret 
but after 'Arafat and other Palestinians alluded to written 
pledges on Jerusalem the decision was taken to release the 
contents. 
  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin last month strenuously denied 
such a letter existed when 'Arafat declared he had received a 
written undertaking on Jerusalem. 
  "There is no secret agreement. There is no document which 
has not been published. Everything has been made public," Rabin 
told parliament on May 12. 
  The right-wing opposition charged he was lying during a 
bitter debate. 
  On May 30, Rabin appeared to climb down, telling a 
parliamentary committee: "According to my information, 'Arafat 
has received only a piece of a speech by Peres on the freedom of 
religion and access to Moslem holy places in Jerusalem." 
  Amid growing controversy over Jerusalem, which both Israel 
and the Palestinians claim as capital, Faysal al-Husayni, the 
PLO leader on the West Bank, confirmed the existence of secret 
Israeli undertakings. 
  Al-Husayni said: "There is a letter from Israel and the 
question of Jerusalem and the PLO institutions in the city and 
on other subjects. I cannot say any more." 
  A close aide to Peres told AFP: "He has committed two 
errors. 
First he denied this letter existed when it does exist and he 
should have published it when it was sent. 
  "At that time no would have paid it any attention." 
  "Now it will pour oil on the flames and the right will use 
the story against us." 
  Right-wingers are preparing a major campaign to keep 'Arafat 
out of Jerusalem and intend to throw a human cordon around the 
city. 
  The PLO leader was expected to visit the autonomous enclave 
of Jericho in the middle of this month. However at the weekend 
he suggested further delays unless donor countries came up with 
money for autonomy. 
  Israel captured east Jerusalem from Jordanian rule in the 
1967 Middle East war and annexed it. 
  In 1980, Israel declared the holy city its united and 
eternal 
capital, but foreign countries do not recognize the annexation 
and maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Gadi Sukenik] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, who returned from 
Morocco tonight, says that he and King Hassan agreed to launch 
telephone and postal lines from Morocco to Israel, and that 
reciprocal diplomatic representations will be probably opened by 
the end of the year. 
  Replying to a question, Peres said the letter with portions 
of his Knesset address on the issue of Jerusalem, which had been 
sent to the Norwegian foreign minister, was not even marked as 
confidential, and it contained no new elements. Our political 
correspondent Gadi Sukenik reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Sukenik] Mr. Peres, it was hoped that 
this visit would result in some kind of a formal link between 
the two countries. Why did it not happen? 
  [Peres] I do not know whose hopes they were. Our only hope 
was to move the major multilateral convention, the one that was 
slated to be held in Amman, to Morocco. I finalized this point 
with the Americans; I finalized it with the king; a date has 
been set. Israel will participate in it, as will many Arab 
countries; it will be unprecedented. If you ask me, it matters 
to me more than having a consular official here and there. 
  [Sukenik] Still, when do you expect a Moroccan 
representation to be inaugurated in Israel? 
  [Peres] I know the date, but I will not divulge it. 
  [Sukenik] This year? 
  [Peres] Yes, possibly before the end of this year. [end 
recording] 
  [Sukenik] While Mr. Peres was abroad, he was informed by the 
prime minister on the telephone of the appointment of Efrayim 
Sne, a Rabin camp member, to a ministerial position. Peres had 
been opposed to the appointment, and his camp members reported 
his harsh reaction after the fact. 
  [Begin recording] [Peres] It is all absolute nonsense. I 
spoke with the prime minister. We reached an understanding, and 
I am positive the understanding will be adhered to. 
  [Sukenik] What is that understanding? 
  [Peres] When it is publicized, I will announce it even on 
television. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F>
'Ido Baum; place not given -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Peres] During my visit to 
Morocco we agreed on four conferences to be held in Morocco with 
Israel's participation. One, the multilateral economic meeting 
to be held next month, in the beginning of June [as heard]; two, 
a conference dealing with desertification initiated by us; 
three, a conference on Middle East development scheduled for 
late October or early November. The Americans are deeply 
involved in preparing this conference. There will also be a 
business conference between Israel and Morocco. 
  Most of us are obsessed with the past, with symbols and 
gestures. There is a different world out there, however, with 
different rules, and I see things differently. 
  [Baum] Will future political relations be facilitated by the 
economic relations to be forged in these conferences? 
  [Peres] If you really want to understand, allow me to 
explain with these phrases. The idea is that American, 
European, and the Japanese governments grant their companies 
guarantees for investments in the Middle East. We will give all 
these companies a list of proposals for factories in the entire 
Middle East -- both regional and national factories. When they 
decide on a certain factory, their government will guarantee 
their investment. This is unprecedented--an extremely original 
idea that Clinton and other leaders have accepted. You should 
not compare this to anything else, because it is not similar to 
anything else. This conference, which will be held in 
Marrakech, is being organized by two companies, one European and 
one American, along with the U.S. and Israeli Governments. A 
senior U.S. Administration representative will participate in 
the conference, apparently Christopher himself. Some 1,500 
companies worldwide will participate. 
  We have to realize that at the present time the main problem 
worldwide is economic prosperity, education, and health. This 
is what people are interested in. People are sick and tired of 
all this diplomatic business, of the outworn diplomatic minutiae. 
  [Baum] Mr. Foreign Minister, if we are speaking about the 
economic issue, I would like to address Yasir 'Arafat's economic 
problems. He is complaining that he is not receiving the aid he 
was promised. 
  [Peres] He, too, is not doing what he has to do. We are 
trying to help in this respect, too. 
  [Baum] Do you think foreign countries could provide more 
aid? 
  [Peres] They can do so and are willing to do so. 'Arafat, 
however, must establish institutions that have what is known as 
transparent bookkeeping. No democratic country will give even 
one penny unless it knows precisely where and for what purpose 
it is being used. Look, no country will donate toward vague and 
unclear aims. The truth is, however, that we are going to lose 
the world. Look, the world is big and does not revolve around 
us. We are not the only country in the world. Many places in 
the world are crying out for help and aid. This is one of the 
reasons why we should act more quickly. There is still a lot of 
goodwill toward us, but it will not hold out for ever. We must 
harbor no illusions about this. We must act more quickly in this 
issue; we are trying to facilitate this process as much as 
possible, but we are encountering considerable difficulties from 
all sides. You know, there is an American expression entitlism, 
I am entitled to [last five words in English], and 'Arafat for 
some reason seems to subscribe to this view. We have to realize 
that the world is built on mutuality, on give and take. Nobody 
deserves to receive bread from heaven; this happened only once 
to the Jewish people, when it kept them going for 40 years in 
the desert. 
  [Baum] Turning to another issue, Mr. Foreign Minister, while 
you were abroad the press was rife with speculations regarding 
your reaction to the fact that no one from your camp was 
appointed as a new minister. 
  [Peres] I am not advancing a camp, I have colleagues and I 
like to advance all of them. You know, people are trying to 
depict me in a completely unrealistic way. I am totally 
engrossed by the peace process. I support the advancement of 
young colleagues, but I am against appointments done on a 
factional and cliquish basis. I have advanced many young 
colleagues. I have never posed any conditions and I do not 
intend to do so in future. 
  [Baum] Is there no rift between Yitzhaq Rabin and yourself 
regarding this issue? 
  [Peres] There is no rift. The only issue that can cause a 
rift is the peace process. I already said as much at the 
beginning of my career in the government and I keep repeating 
this. Nobody can make me deviate from my path. I am not 
interested in press speculations on power games and on who 
screwed who. I will aid any young and talented Labor Party 
member, and those outside the party too. 
  [Baum] Is there any particular candidate for such aid? 
  [Peres] I will issue an announcement when I have something 
to announce.

  [Text] Elyaqim Rubinstein, who heads the Israeli delegation 
to the talks with Jordan, has expressed cautious optimism about 
Jordan's readiness to make progress in the negotiations. 
  [Begin Rubinstein recording] We are leaving for a very 
official trilateral -- Israeli-Jordanian-American -- meeting, 
which is a continuation of previous trilateral meetings. It 
will deal with commercial ties and development of the Jordan 
Rift Valley, which are real and complex issues. What other 
issues on the periphery of those talks will be discussed? We 
meet with the Jordanians on all sorts of things linked to the 
agreed upon agenda, but I think that the main focus is in those 
trilateral talks. 
  What chance does such a meeting have? The likelihood is 
there will be slow progress -- like the negotiations with Jordan 
in general. These negotiations can be implemented, but are 
constantly under pressures, which do not come from Israel, but 
from the other side. We try to make as much progress as 
possible, taking into account those pressures. [end recording] 
  That was Elyaqim Rubinstein prior to his departure for 
Washington.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>
  [Text] Israel has asked the United States to deliver a 
harsh message to Saudi Arabia so that the latter will change its 
negative behavior regarding the peace process and primarily the 
multilateral talks. Senior political sources in Jerusalem said 
yesterday that the United States has relayed the message to 
Riyadh, calling on it to change its position. 
  Israel presented its complaints regarding Saudi Arabia to 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and made an official 
appeal to the State Department in which Israel detailed the 
negative steps Saudi Arabia has taken. Israeli representatives 
have said that the Saudis have become an obstructive element in 
every regional or multilateral forum, placing obstacles in the 
way of decisions on easing the Arab boycott and normalizing 
relations between Arab countries and Israel. Another claim 
Israel has made is that Saudi Arabia refuses to aid the 
establishment of the Palestinian autonomy. 
  Israeli sources have said that according to information 
obtained in Jerusalem, Saudi Arabia pressured Oman and Qatar to 
slow down their normalization with Israel. The two emirates 
which neighbor on Saudi Arabia had agreed to host Israeli 
delegations in multilateral talks and started economic talks 
with Israeli elements. The foreign ministers of both countries 
met with Foreign Minister Peres. 
  The charges against Saudi Arabia emerged against the 
background of its conduct at the multilateral talks on arms 
control, held in Qatar last month. Unlike in the previous 
rounds of talks, the Saudis dispatched a rather high-level 
delegation to Qatar, but the delegation foiled every attempt to 
make progress in ratifying a declaration of principles and 
establishing confidence-building measures. 
  "The Saudis have become the pawns of the Syrians, 
representing them in the multilateral talks," political sources 
said last night in Jerusalem. "They have been torpedoing every 
proposal and preventing progress, claiming that regional 
cooperation is unattainable without the participation of Syria 
and Lebanon. That means that Saudi Arabia has been granting 
Syria a right to veto every step of the talks." 
  Israel and Saudi Arabia had attempted to establish a direct 
channel of contacts between them through their ambassadors in 
Washington. Last year, Professor Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's 
ambassador to the United States, held a series of secret 
meetings with the Saudi ambassador, Prince Bandar Bin Sultan. 
The meetings were held in the private residences of U.S. 
officials and Jews who are the prince's acquaintances. 
Rabinovich reported the content of the meetings to the highest 
political echelons in Jerusalem. 
  The meetings between the two stopped several months ago, but 
Israeli sources have claimed that there is no link between the 
termination of the talks and the current Israeli charges against 
Saudi Arabia. 
  Foreign Ministry working papers regarding the future of the 
political process say that Saudi Arabia, as a major 
representative of the Gulf states, should be given a leading 
role in the process.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen] </F>
  [Excerpt] Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Martino would 
like to visit Israel soon in order to settle matters in the wake 
of the appointment of three neofascist ministers to Silvio 
Berlusconi's new government. The new government has yet to 
receive Israel's blessing. Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin 
is demanding that Israel cool its ties with Italy in the wake of 
the appointments. Italy's Jewish community is opposed to such a 
move. Our political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen reports on 
the controversy: 
  [Begin recording] [Rosen] Today the world should hear 
Israel loud and clear, Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin said. 
He suggests taking resolute steps toward chillier relations 
with Italy following the appointment of neofascist ministers to 
the Berlusconi cabinet. 
  Israel did not applaud Italy's political upheaval, and Rabin 
has deliberately refrained from congratulating the new prime 
minister. Beilin has already ordered a freeze on the departure 
of a delegation to a cultural conference. 
  [Beilin] Obviously, we cannot take a light view of this. It 
is the first time a party with neofascist elements is 
participating in a European government. 
  [Rosen] Beilin's adamant position is opposed by many Italian 
Jews, as well as members of the professional Foreign Ministry 
echelons who believe Israel should wait and judge the neofascist 
ministers on the basis of their actions and pronouncements as of 
now. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] The cabinet today approved working permits for 
35,000 Arabs of the territories to enter Israel. Approximately 
20,000 have been designated for the construction sector. 
  Next week, the cabinet is due to discuss the request of 
Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer for another 20,000 
permits. After the cabinet meeting, Minister Yosi Sarid said 
any Palestinian with what he called a serious and urgent medical 
case, will be allowed to receive treatment in Israel. Also at 
the cabinet meeting, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said he 
believed there appears to be positive movement by Jordan in the 
peace talks. Security officers told the ministers they were 
pleased with the way the Palestinian police were operating in 
the self-rule areas, but they said the fact that members of the 
police are not getting their salaries could cause problems for 
both Palestinians and Israelis. 
  Police Minister Shahal has rejected Yasir 'Arafat's claim 
that Israeli rule has destroyed the Palestinian education, 
health, and housing services in Gaza and Jericho. In an 
interview with Jack Katzenell, Shahal said the economic progress 
of the Palestinians in the territories has surpassed that of the 
Arabs in Syria, Iraq, and even Jordan. The minister said it was 
high time Yasir 'Arafat came to Gaza instead of just talking. 
Shahal also rejected Likud opposition charges that the 
government had given Yasir 'Arafat a secret letter about the 
future of Jerusalem. 
  [Begin recording] [Shahal] We did not give or submit any 
commitment on the issue of Jerusalem beyond the documents that 
have been submitted to the Knesset after the Cairo agreement. 
  [Katzenell] Mr. al-Husayni was saying that he and the other 
Palestinian leaders in and around Jerusalem are going to 
continue establishing Palestinian offices, Palestinian 
institutions, Palestinian governing bodies here in Jerusalem. 
Where do you stand on this? Is this a violation of the 
agreement and what precisely are you, as police minister, going 
to do about it? 
  [Shahal] Well, certainly if the Palestinians are going to 
establish Palestinian organizations and institutes in Jerusalem, 
this is a violation of the agreement, of the declaration of 
principles, and we certainly are going to take measures to 
prevent the establishment of such institutes in Jerusalem. 
  [Katzenell] What about armed Palestinian security guards? 
We hear that he has armed guards at Orient House. 
  [Shahal] This should be licensed by the Israeli Police and 
certainly there will be no armed force in Jerusalem which does 
not belong to the Israeli police force. If any person will do 
such a thing then he is violating the laws and he will be 
arrested like any other person within the state of Israel. 
  [Katzenell] Lastly sir, Yasir 'Arafat said yesterday that 
Israel is leaving scorched earth in Gaza. The educational 
system is destroyed, the housing is destroyed, everything is 
destroyed. All the services are destroyed, he says, because of 
the occupation. What is your reply to this? Has Israel 
neglected and even destroyed the civilian infrastructure of the 
territories? 
  [Shahal] Compared to what we received after the Six-Day War, 
the situation in health, education, and the infrastructure is 
immensely better than what we received. I think that what we 
have done during that period of time cannot be compared even to 
the progress in other Arab countries. The Palestinians living 
in the West Bank and Gaza have more telephones per family, more 
cars per family, than those say in Syria, or in Iraq, or even in 
Jordan. [end recording] 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 1500 GMT on 5 June 
also 
reports that "the government has approved a loan of 400 million 
shekels to the Kupat Holim Klalit Health Fund. Finance Minister 
Avraham Shohat and Police Minister Moshe Shahal supported 
appointing a receiver to the health fund, but they were the only 
ministers who voted against the loan. Meretz ministers Yosi 
Sarid and Ya'ir Tzaban abstained. Finance Minister Shohat said 
he would honor the cabinet's decision though he said it did not 
provide the solution necessary, and that drastic steps are 
necessary to reform the health fund."]

injuries. Two other soldiers and a border policeman sustained 
slight injuries. 
  Our correspondent notes that an investigation into the 
incident in which a grenade was thrown at an IDF unit this

  [Text] Border police have detained dozens of rioters and 
stone throwers in Hebron and a curfew has been imposed on the 
town center. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that two 
explosive devices were hurled at an IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
patrol last night, but nobody was hurt. Disturbances broke out 
a short time ago in Ramallah. A soldier sustained light wounds 
from a stone and glass splinters when a military vehicle was 
stoned in the center of town. One of the soldiers opened fire to 
extricate the vehicle from the stone throwers. Border police 
forces restored order with tear gas and rubber bullets. There 
have so far been four people lightly wounded and they were 
transferred to Ramallah hospital. 
  The IDF this morning prevented a group of Jordan Rift Valley 
settlers from entering Jericho in a convoy bearing Israeli flags 
thereby protesting the fact that at the weekend the IDF 
prevented one of the settlers from passing through Jericho with 
an Israeli flag. Earlier, there was a clash between Israeli 
policemen and the demonstrators when the former tried to prevent 
Palestinian vehicles from traveling with PLO flags along roads 
in the Jordan Rift Valley.

  [Text] Tunis, 3 Jun (MENA) -- PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat 
last night received Sten Anderson, head of the Scandinavian 
Countries Council and Sweden's former foreign minister. 
  The Palestinian News Agency WAFA said 'Arafat and Anderson 
discussed the latest developments in the Middle East peace 
process, especially the Palestinian National Authority's 
takeover of its tasks in the Palestinian land. The discussion 
also dealt with the Palestinian Authority's responsibility for 
reconstructing Palestine and the international community's 
responsibility to help in this task. 
  The Palestinian News Agency said the head of the 
Scandinavian 
Countries Council expressed his support for the Palestinian 
National Authority with all means to enable it to implement its 
tasks. 
  Informed sources here expressed their belief that announcing 
this meeting, which might have taken place in 'Arafat's home, 
aims to counter reports on the seriousness of 'Arafat's illness. 
  Informed Palestinian sources affirmed that a suite has been 
booked for 'Arafat at the Medical City in Jordan and that 
'Arafat will be moved there in the next few days for treatment 
and necessary medical tests. 
  It was announced yesterday that 'Arafat had suffered a 
severe 
ailment that kept him at home and halted his activities.

  [Text] Brother Hakam Bal'awi, PLO Executive Committee 
member and representative in the Republic of Tunisia, has 
categorically denied news circulated by news agencies on the 
state of health of the brother President Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 
'Arafat], which necessitate transferring him to the Medical City 
in Amman. 
  Brother Hakam Bal'awi said that all the news circulated by 
the news agencies is untrue, and that president 'Arafat's 
appointments' schedule continues according to their priorities. 
The truth is that that he took a rest for a few hours after 
catching a cold. 
  He concluded his statement by saying that the brother 
president is well and that everything that the mass media 
circulated is untrue.

  [Text] Tehran, June 3, IRNA -- The Foreign Ministry Friday 
condemned the Zionist bombardment of Ba'labakk of Lebanon 
Thursday morning and called on all world nations and governments 
to deal with the aggressive acts of the Zionist entity. 
  The statement reminded that scores of innocent Muslims had 
been martyred or wounded in the bombardment and added that the 
incident was one aftermath of the treacherous policies of some 
in their dealings with the Zionist regime and of the so-called 
appeasement policies in the region. 
  It said such incidents are proof that aggression and 
trespass 
against others is the inherent nature of the Zionist entity and 
that any effort aimed at conciliation with the Zionist regime 
will bring only misery and self-humiliation (to the Muslim 
nations).

Rabbani. 
  According to a Central News Unit report from Islamabad, at 
the meeting the latest Afghan domestic developments, bilateral 
ties, and important international and regional issues were 
discussed. 
  In the course of the meeting our country's deputy foreign 
minister for Asian and Oceanic affair said that the events in 
Afghanistan are important to the Islamic Republic of Iran and 
called for a swifter establishment of peace and stability in 
that country. Mr. Borujerdi declared our country's readiness 
for cooperation with the Afghan government and considered the 
unrest in that country as the only obstacle to implementing the 
agreement between the two countries. 
  At the meeting, Afghan President Borhanoddin Rabbani, 
praising the efforts by the Islamic Republic of Iran for 
establishing peace in Afghanistan, said that the fact that the 
Islamic Republic of Iran embassy is open as the only active 
diplomatic representation in Kabul under the very difficult 
conditions due to clashes demonstrates the good will and 
interest of the Islamic Republic of Iran in resolving 
Afghanistan's internal problems.

She said we are ready for negotiations but blackmail cannot be 
allowed. Referring to allegations leveled by the opposition

forgery and the government is considering taking strict action 
against those responsible. The prime minister said the

undermining the democratic system.

  [Text] His Majesty King Husayn has stressed the need for 
promoting general performance, caring for Jordanians, and paying 
attention to the internal front to build an ideal homeland. 
These remarks were made by His Majesty King Husayn after 
chairing part of the cabinet's session in the presence of His 
Highness Crown Prince Hasan, Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam 
al-Majali, and Royal Court Chief His Excellency al-Sharif Zayd 
Bin-Shakir. More details in the following report by our 
correspondent for political affairs Salim 'Ali Dhiyab: 
  [Begin recording] [Dhiyab] The most important events and 
developments in the region in addition to reviewing the most 
important domestic issues were the main topics of the cabinet's 
session, part of which was chaired by his Majesty King Husayn. 
His majesty stressed the need for promoting the general 
performance and caring for the Jordanians, who are the object of 
all concerns, to build an ideal homeland. 
  Speaking to reporters at the Prime Ministry following the 
cabinet session, his majesty the king commended the performance 
of the government of Dr. al-Majali and called for paying 
attention to the internal front. 
  [Husayn] I believe the information ministers will adequately 
cover the issue. The meeting was, undoubtedly, good. We 
thanked his excellency the prime minister and the brothers for 
their efforts and continuous giving. We also made a review of 
both the regional situation and the expected developments in the 
coming phase. We emphasized the need for this country to remain 
cohesive as one family from various origins and descents. We 
should enjoy awareness and vigilance and study all that took 
place and has thus far taken place so we will draw the 
conclusions required for effective action that guarantees the 
country's future in terms of its steadfastness, in order to 
serve the kinsfolk and brothers in Palestine with regard to 
their rights on their national soil. We discussed many things, 
and God willing, you will be acquainted with the details. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, how do you view the peace 
process and its future in light of the new developments, 
including the aggression against southern Lebanon and the 
cancellation of the visit to the region by the U.S. secretary of 
state? 
  [Husayn] I believe that the process is serious and 
continuous 
despite any urgent events. There is no doubt that we all were 
pained by what happened to sisterly Lebanon, the human losses, 
and the encroachment on its territory. However, the train is 
proceeding. We are here talking about terms that are more 
accurate than the issue of coordination, because it seems to us 
that coordination with the brothers is a desire and a hope. 
Practically, however, it has not been crystallized into 
reality, not even to a satisfactory minimum level -- that is, we 
understand the details of all that is happening and the others 
understand the details of all that is taking place. It seems 
that the work in this direction is unilateral. 
  In any case, we should continue on the basis of the agenda, 
concentrate on the issue of land and water, and discuss all 
developments to tackle all items related to us with regard to 
the abovementioned agenda as a basis to reach the objective of 
peace which reassures people about their present and future 
situation, and which will give them all opportunities in the 
future. At the same time, we have great hope that the other 
tracks will proceed in a satisfactory way. I am fully convinced 
that this will happen. 
  With regard to the Jordanian-Palestenian coordination, we, 
on 
our part, are ready. Once again, our stand is clear. If our 
brothers raise with us any issue we will support them with our 
utmost. But, to say we are one team working together, this, 
regrettably, is still within the framework of wishes that would 
not turn into reality. Therefore, we should also pay attention 
to ourselves. The basis is that this country must be firm. It 
has a power to reinforce the opportunities of our kinsfolk and 
brothers to reach their rights. They are now walking on the road 
they have chosen--a sole and legitimate representative of the 
Palestinian people in terms of the leadership. With regard to 
their soil and situation, the Palestinian Arab people decide 
with regard to the present and future situation, with regard to 
the soundness or unsoundness of the course. We cannot say 
anything in this regard or track. We wish them success and we 
will support them to our utmost. At the same time, we should 
pay attention to our situation here so that we will not become 
the weak or marginalized part. The results of that would be, 
God forbid, catastrophic on both the national and pan-Arab 
levels. 
  [Correspondent] Regarding the borders with Israel, there are 
signs that Israel is ready to discuss the issue. Will this be 
discussed by the tripartite committee? 
  [Husayn] This topic is on the agenda which I have noted. I 
believe it should be discussed. Yes. 
  [Correspondent] During the meeting of the tripartite 
committee in Washington? 
  [Husayn] I believe it should be done. We consider this a 
basic issue as well as the issue of border, territory, water.

Morocco Friday [3 June] and said Israel insists that the 
Palestinian self-rule would be in Jericho and not in Jerusalem. 
  [Begin Peres recording] I did not send any letter to Yasir 
'Arafat. I sent a letter to the Norwegian foreign minister in 
response to his letter to me. My letter was not even addressed 
top secret and contained my remarks to the Knesset. The reason 
for my action was our insistence that the Palestinian civilian 
authority be based in Jericho and not in Jerusalem. I said we 
do not want to harm the spiritual, cultural, medical 
institutions in Jerusalem, but that the authority would deal 
only with Jericho. I would like to remind you that the 
negotiations almost blew up over the Jericho issue because of 
our insistence that the autonomy's center would be in Jericho.

  [Excerpts] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres says Saudi 
Arabia is obstructing the peace process. He told reporters in 
Jerusalem the Saudis had broken their promise to lift the Arab 
boycott and had taken a negative position at the arms control 
talks. On other issues, Peres said Israel insists that the 
Palestinian autonomy institutions be in Jericho, not Jerusalem, 
and he hoped Israel relations with Italy would remain cordial in 
spite of the appointment of three neofascists to the new Italian 
Government. Jack Katzenell reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Katzenell] Foreign Minister Peres was 
speaking to reporters after a meeting with the visiting 
Philippines Foreign Minister Roberto Romulo. Peres was asked if 
it is true that Saudi Arabia is obstructing the peace process. 
  [Peres] Yes, there are disappointments in our country about 
the Saudis' position on two or three issues. 
  [Katzenell] At the beginning of the peace process, Peres 
said, Saudi representatives promised Jewish audiences in the 
United States that if Israel changed its settlement policy, the 
Arabs, including Saudi Arabia, would lift the economic boycott 
against Israel. 
  [Peres] We did our part. I do not think it was reciprocated. 
  [Katzenell] In addition, Peres said, the Saudis adopted a 
negative attitude at the recent multilateral talks on arms 
control in Qatar. [passage omitted] 
  [Katzenell] Turning to the problem of the three neofascist 
ministers in the new Italian Government, a Foreign Ministry 
official told me this morning that Israel is not even 
considering the recall of its ambassador. Foreign Minister 
Peres admitted that the neofascists do pose a problem, but 
Israel would do nothing hasty. He would be meeting the new 
Foreign Minister Antonio Martinio and would listen to what he 
had to say sympathetically. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Linking Kashmir and the Nuclear Issue"] </F>
  [Text] President Farooq Leghari, currently on a visit to 
the United States, has in an interview with Cable News Network 
(CNN) urged the U.S. to play a key role in resolving the Kashmir 
issue. He has, at the same time, sought to establish a linkage 
between Kashmir and the nuclear issue, which remains high on the 
U.S. agenda. However, the problem is that current U.S. policy 
favours dealing with the two issues separately. This was fairly 
evident from the observations of the U.S. deputy secretary of 
state after his recent visit to the subcontinent. 
  Kashmir, as far as the U.S. is concerned, is to be dealt 
with 
by India and Pakistan, bilaterally, under the terms of the Simla 
Agreement. This, of course, suits India which has successfully 
managed to avoid meaningful bilateral negotiations with Pakistan 
on the Kashmir issue for over two decades. At the same time, 
India has consistently turned down proposals for involving any 
third party in the matter and asserted, at times with a touch of 
the indignant, that the two neighbours were perfectly capable of 
resolving their own problems. However, it is clear that Pakistan 
now sees a third party role as unavoidable if India is to be 
pushed into addressing the Kashmir issue seriously and put an 
end to its efforts to resolve it through sheer brute force. 
Such a role would be far from unprecedented in the context of 
settling matters between the two countries. As President 
Leghari pointed out at another forum, the Indus Basin Treaty and 
the Runn of Kutch award were agreements reached on difficult 
issues only after third party intercession. 
  As for the nuclear issue, not only is the U.S. unwilling to 
link it with Kashmir, it also seems to be giving way to India's 
contention that the nuclear programmes of India and Pakistan 
cannot be treated on a par and should be dealt with separately 
by the United States. In effect, this means that the U.S. should 
continue to pressurise Pakistan through various means, such as 
the Pressler Amendment, while India continues developing its 
nuclear potential as well as missile technology. It may well be 
in this context that President Leghari has struck a tough note 
on the issue of inspection, of any kind, of nuclear sites. 
While a recent statement of the foreign minister made it seem 
as if Pakistan was willing to consider on merits a U.S. proposal 
for non-intrusive inspection, the president has now pointedly 
emphasised the aspect of linkage by asserting that Pakistan will 
accept inspection or verification regimes only in the context of 
a regional solution involving India. The U.S. may have logical 
grounds for believing that certain major issues pertaining to 
the subcontinent are more amenable to a solution, when dealt 
with separately, but if such a mode is seen to work to the 
advantage of only one party the other is bound to see linkage, 
at least in some areas, as unavoidable.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Indian Navy's New Submarine; Increase in Troops </F>
Along Sindh Border"] 
  [Text] A second indigenously built submarine has been 
handed over to the Indian Navy. With this second indigenously 
built submarine, India has joined the list of countries that 
manufacture submarines. The first indigenously built submarine 
was handed over in February. India named the submarine Shankul. 
It was manufactured with German technical assistance. 
  India currently has the largest navy in South Asia and the 
fifth largest in the world. India also possesses Russian-made 
submarines that can launch nuclear weapons. With the exception 
of China, there is no other country in this part of the world 
that can match India's military might. India does not face a 
military threat from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, or any 
other country, but it is constantly increasing its war 
preparedness as well as the power of its air, sea, and ground 
forces. The objective of this military buildup is nothing short 
of asserting regional hegemony, keeping the small countries 
under pressure, and maintaining an aggressive military 
occupation in Kashmir. Because Pakistan lends moral, political, 
and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri demand for the right to 
self-determination, India has directed the bulk of its might 
against Pakistan. 
  According to press reports, India has dispatched its 3rd 
Tank 
Division, which has expertise in desert warfare, to the desert 
regions of Rajasthan to conduct military exercises in the acute 
heat near the border with Pakistan's Sindh Province. Two corps 
of Indian troops are already deployed on the Indian side of the 
Sindh border, and the deployment of the (?3rd) Tank Division 
tremendously enhances India's military strength in the area. 
This is a matter of great concern for Pakistan. There is 
another report that along with assembling a mechanized division, 
India has commenced work on installing Prithvi missiles in the 
area. About 100 Prithvi missiles are expected to be installed 
in the area. Defense analysts have expressed apprehensions that 
a frenzy toward a "decisive war" with Pakistan is gaining 
intensity in India. General B.C. Joshi, chief of the Indian 
armed forces, is regarded as a supporter of a decisive war with 
Pakistan. India can launch a drive against Pakistan to divert 
the attention of its people as well as the world from the 
conditions it faces in occupied Kashmir.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ejaz Hussain] </F>
  [Text] If you want peace, prepare for war. Generations 
after generations in nations after nations, leaders have 
faithfully followed the ancient Roman maxim. Over the 
centuries, society's ability to wage war has become an 
institutionalized permanent integer with large resources devoted 
to armies. Today scores of countries are engaged in building 
the nuclear missile empires. Their lust for acquiring weapons of 
mutual assured destruction is rapidly increasing and despite 
incessant calls for shrinkage in lethal weapons, they are as 
diehard as they were ever. In this deadly arms race, not only 
the developed and advanced first world countries are contenders, 
but some poor countries from third world [word indistinct] are 
equally active participants. 
  India, for example, with a population of 900 million people, 
of whom over 50 percent are homeless, jobless and foodless, is 
spending more than four percent of its GNP [Gross National 
Product] on defense. This time for the year 1994-95, India 
raised its defense budget from rupees 192 billion to rupees 230 
billion. It means straightaway 20 percent increase, which is 
unprecedented for any country in peace time. When this budget 
was being announced by the Indian finance minister, Mr. Manmohan 
Singh, the pressmen, who were attending the budget session, were 
whispering about the Indian nuclear program and missile 
technology. 
  As a proof to that India has accelerated its efforts to 
build 
yet another intercontinental ballistic missile named Surya 
[Sun], which is nearing its final test at Orissa. According to 
the latest information, Indian defense scientists are busy day 
and night to perform an early testing of Surya. The lethal 
missile will have a range of 12,000 km, but later on, the 
scientists say that its range will be enhanced to 20,000 km. 
The new Indian missile will not only be a constant threat to 
the Asian region, but it would have even Washington well within 
the total devastation precision limit of New Delhi, which means 
that it will be much more formidable than the Agni-3, which was 
tested in February this year despite mounting apprehensive 
feelings of the defense analysts of Pentagon and Pall Mall. It 
will be five times heavier than Prithvi and 10 times powerful in 
destructiveness. According to reports, India will spend over 
200 million rupees on Surya's first test which will be performed 
in the mid of 1995. 
  With Trishul, Indira, Agni, Prithvi and now Surya, India has 
emerged as an aggressor in the world. It neither accepts words 
of advice from the International Atomic Energy Agency, nor peace 
instructions of Carnegie Endowment For International Peace. It 
has no other peaceful pursuits either. It has its own pros and 
cons if it makes economic blockade of Nepal or bullies Maldives, 
interferes with internal affairs of Sri Lanka or intimidates 
Bangladesh, or kills tens of thousands of innocent Kashmiris, or 
for that matter holds Pakistan responsible for heat wave in 
Bombay. All it considers are very just and appropriate actions. 
How cynical it is to visualize that Russia and the United 
States, the two inveterate super rivals, are destroying their 
stockpiles of dangerous weapons as a service to international 
peace, but India still is building up its military empire beyond 
limits. Aggression against whom? Military build up against 
whom? Lethal weapons and deadly arsenals against whom? India 
still has not learned a lesson from Russia. It is a matter of 
great concern for the United States and the United Nations who 
are devoted to make the entire world nuclear free. So, such an 
extraordinary increase in stockpiles of deadly weapons is the 
blatant violation of the principles of global peace.

  [Text] Baghdad, 2 Jun (INA) -- Jordanian Interior Minister 
Salamah Hammad has asserted that Jordan sided with Iraq as an 
expression of its support for the Iraqi people in their 
opposition to aggression and hegemony. 
  He added that Jordan realizes the magnitude of plotting 
against the Arab and Islamic nation, which calls for activating 
the nation's capabilities in the face of foreign challenges. 
  Hammad further said that the unjust blockade imposed on Iraq 
and its unyielding people has lost all its justifications after 
Iraq has complied with all international resolutions imposed 
unfairly on it. 
  Salamah Hammad visited the holy shrines in al-Hadrah 
al-Qadiriyah, al-Imam al-'Azam, al-Rawdah al-Kazimiyah, and the 
Royal Cemetery in Baghdad. 
  The custodians of the religious shrines informed the guest 
minister of President Saddam Husayn's concern for the holy 
shrines and places of worship. 
  Salamah Hammad also laid a wreath on the Martyr's Memorial 
and read verses from the Koran for the souls of the martyrs. He 
then visited the gallery that contains martyr medals. He wrote 
in the visitor's book, praising the brave position of the Iraqi 
martyrs and their generous sacrifices to defend the soil of Iraq 
and the glorious Arab nation.

  [Text] [Jordanian] Interior Minister Salamah Hammad met 
with his Iraqi counterpart Watban Ibrahim in Baghdad yesterday. 
  The IRAQI NEWS AGENCY quoted Ibrahim as hailing Jordan's 
position on Iraq during and after the Gulf war. 
  AKHIR KHABAR has learned that Hammad's visit to Baghdad 
follows several diplomatic and political contacts relating to 
Jordanian citizens in Iraq. It also learned that Hammad is 
carrying a special security file on activating security 
agreements signed previously in Amman and Baghdad. The file 
also deals with the recent increase in cases against Jordanian 
citizens. 
  AKHIR KHABAR also learned that the interior minister's talks 
in Baghdad deal with increasing bilateral coordination, and 
reaching an agreement on a mechanism to control illegal trade 
across the Jordanian-Iraqi border, especially following an 
increase in smuggling operations. 
  Hammad's visit also aims at fostering bilateral security 
coordination. 
  Observers noted that Hammad is the first official to visit 
Iraq after the latest government changes, according to which 
President Saddam Husayn assumed the post of prime minister in 
order to launch the battle to lift the siege imposed on Iraq.

  [Text] Vice President Taha Yasin Ramadan has said the worst 
time of the blockade is over and that only a little remains now, 
thanks to the steadfastness of the Iraqis and their rallying 
around their symbol leader, struggler President Saddam Husayn. 
  During a meeting with the chairman and members of the 
Executive Bureau of the General Federation of Trade Unions 
today, Ramadan said the steadfastness of the struggling Iraqi 
people, their jihad spirit, absolute faith in their just cause, 
and constant readiness to make sacrifices will fragment the 
unjust blockade and thwart colonialist-Zionist schemes and their 
evil objectives. 
  Taha Yasin Ramadan urged direct interaction with the 
citizens 
and diagnosing their suffering and ways of remedying it through 
presenting views and opinions that enhance the steadfastness of 
the people and their ability to face the unjust blockade and 
foil the remaining chapters of the colonialist-Zionist 
conspiracy. 
  He stressed that the brave jihad position of the Iraqi 
people 
and their valiant steadfastness in the face of the malicious 
blockade have removed all the justifications of aggression and 
contributed to isolating the U.S. position that aims at 
perpetuating the blockade in order to undermine Iraq's security, 
sovereignty, and free, independent will.

<F P=106> ["Standpoint" column by 'Isa Isma'il al-'Abbadi: "Washington </F>
Ignores the Interests of Its Allies"] 
  [Text] The United States does not mind harming even its own 
allies by ignoring their legitimate national interests and 
regional relations. The clearest example of this is the harm 
done to Turkey by the unfair blockade that the U.S. 
Administration has imposed on Iraq in the name of the UN 
Security Council. 
  A few years ago, at the beginning of the unjust blockade on 
Iraq, we were the ones who were warning of its potential harm. 
Today, it is Turkish officials who are speaking about the harm 
that has been done to their economy and who are demanding the 
removal of the blockade on Iraq. 
  This is not all. Turkish officials, beginning with President 
Demirel and Prime Minister Cillar and including several other 
senior officials, have expressed their concern about the adverse 
effects of the blockade on the Turkish people and economy, as 
well as its effects on living and security conditions in Turkey. 
  The last to express such concern was Masoud Yilmaz, 
president 
of the Motherland Party, who called for the opening of the 
al-Khabur border post with Iraq. Addressing a rally in Shirnak 
[as transliterated] on the Iraqi-Turkish border, Yilmaz called 
for the resumption of border trade to improve economic 
conditions in the area. "The economic crisis and widespread 
unemployment in the area have reached an intolerable level," he 
said. 
  What Yilmaz said constitutes the substance of Turkey's 
appeal 
to the international community to completely lift the oil 
embargo on Iraq. So far, Turkey has incurred losses amounting 
to $20 billion as a result of its participation in the blockade 
on Iraq. 
  THE NEW YORK TIMES has quoted Turkish officials and foreign 
diplomats as saying that Turkey is going through a sharp 
economic crisis manifested by a drop in the exchange rate of the 
Turkish lira, deficits in the balance of trade, foreign debts 
amounting to $68 billion dollars, and an annual inflation 
ranging from 50-70 percent. 
  The question here is: How long will the United States 
continue to ignore the will of the international community and 
the interests of its allies by keeping the unfair blockade on 
Iraq? 
  There is no doubt that Washington faces growing 
international 
pressure due to world conviction that Iraq has fulfilled all its 
obligations under Resolution 687 and agreed to permanent 
monitoring under Resolution 715 and that it is now up to the 
Security Council to meet its commitments toward Iraq and apply 
Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687, which permits Iraqi oil exports 
without delay. 
  The unfair blockade on Iraq harms the interests of many 
world 
nations. Iraq has a solid economy and strong relations with 
many states. These states cannot possibly be compensated for 
their normal relations with Iraq. Thus, Turkey, Bulgaria, and 
many others can no longer endure the negative effects and 
results of the unfair blockade and continue with the dangerous 
U.S. game of maintaining aggression and savageness against Iraq. 
  The blockade is besieging those who are imposing it. This 
fact is clear to the Iraqis who resolutely continue to rebuild 
their country and create new factors daily in order to overcome 
the negative effects of the blockade while also determined to 
inflict final defeat on the evil aggressors and to continue 
building their country under the flag of the great leader Saddam 
Husayn.

  [Text] Baghdad, June 2 (INA) -- Iraqi dailies today sternly 
condemned the traitorous behaviour of the Saudi regime of Fahd 
and its conspiring against the nation and Yemen's unity. 
  Al-QADISIYAH daily said that traitorous stand of Fahd regime 
came to be a categorical evidence tangibly proving the fact that 
the Saudi stance had been and was always devastating and 
suspicious pouring in the channel of Arabs and Muslims enemies 
schemes. 
  AL-THAWRAH daily has said if Fahd's conspiratorial stands 
are open and designed under permission of the U.S., which 
brought his family to power, the role of his nephew Bandar 
Bin-Sultan was similar to that of his uncle which are bad and 
against the Arab nation will. 
  AL-'IRAQ daily has said the Saudi regime, of the disgraceful 
record in conspiring on any Arab unity project and on any 
patriotic authority, is adding by its latest move at the UN 
Security Council, another treason of its numerous ones against 
the Arab nation's national interests. 
  It openly discloses its conspiring scheme of bringing 
foreign forces to Yemen as it did with the case before the 
aggression on Iraq.

  [Text] Nicosia, 16 May -- The specialized economic magazine 
MIDDLE EAST ECONOMIC SURVEY (MEES) which is published in Nicosia 
reported today, Monday, that an Iraqi Oil Ministry delegation 
will visit Italy and the Ukraine at the end of this month. 
  The magazine explained that the visit of this delegation, 
which will be headed by Oil Ministry Under Secretary Taha Humud, 
to Rome falls within the framework of the contacts which began 
several months ago between Agip and the Iraqi authorities in 
order to reach agreements on sharing the productions of 
al-Nasiriyah, al-Halfayah, and Dujaylah oilfields in southern 
Iraq. 
  The magazine added that the delegation's visit to the 
Ukraine 
will center on the possibility of importing oil industry 
machinery from that country in exchange for Iraqi oil following 
the lifting of the blockade on Iraq. 
  The magazine pointed out that the talks with the Ukrainian 
oil authorities will also deal with the possibility of Ukrainian 
companies sharing production in and developing al-Yamamah region 
in the vast western al-Qurnah oilfield. 
  Last April, an Iraqi Oil Ministry delegation left for Moscow 
to discuss the development of Mushrif region which is also 
situated in the western al-Qurnah Oilfield. 
  Iraq held contacts with a number of European countries 
several weeks ago in preparation for the period which will 
follow the oil embargo imposed by the United Nations. 
  An iraqi Oil Ministry delegation also visited Paris early 
last March in response to an invitation by the two major French 
petroleum companies Elf-Aquitane and Total.

  [Text] Deputy Prime Ministers Taha Yasin Ramadan and Tariq 
'Aziz and the ministers took the constitutional oath today 
before leader Saddam Husayn, president of the republic and prime 
minister, may God preserve him. 
  The leader president, may God preserve him, chaired the 
first 
meeting of the new Council of Ministers, which lasted 
approximately four and a half hours. During this meeting, his 
excellency delivered the following valuable and important speech: 
  First, we would like to thank brother Ahmad Husayn for 
assuming the tasks of the prime minister over the past period. 
He exerted his utmost in this field. 
  The statement of the Revolution Command Council was very 
clear. Our assessment was that our circumstances require this 
formula in terms of the presidency's relationship with the 
Council of Ministers, despite the fact that it will increase our 
burdens and cost us extra time. This, however, is required. 
  You will continue to assume your ministerial posts, except 
the agriculture minister, who was previously a minister. Now, 
he is a comrade in the party and a governor and knows our 
course. The new thing, however, is the new situation. 
  The new thing is that, as you recall, we addressed the 
Iraqis 
on one occasion and told them: You are in the last 10 days of 
Ramadan. Some people interpreted this by saying that these are 
the last 10 days and that the blockade will be lifted on 'Id 
al-Fitr. They also said that something would happen. I heard 
these interpretations from some people. 
  Meanwhile, what we meant by the last 10 days is the fact 
that 
the largest period of time has passed and that the reward of the 
whole month will be gained during the last 10 days. In other 
words, man will either succeed or fail. The last 10 days need 
additional patience and efforts so that man will gain the reward 
of fasting during the month of Ramadan. 
  Addressing the members of the Council of Ministers, his 
excellency said: 
  In the past, ministers might have taken their time and read 
the newspapers before beginning work. But, now, the first thing 
I will do is read the newspapers after dealing with the basic 
components of the morning mail. As of now, every minister 
should be in his office at 0800. This is the first measure to 
be carried out by all, except the sick person, who should 
telephone Dr. Khalil al-Ma'muri, secretary of the Council of 
Ministers, to inform him that he cannot report to work at his 
ministry. This will help us know that he is sick, to be 
reassured about him, to wish him good health, and to follow up 
his medical situation. Those who are not sick should be present 
in their ministries at 0800. I do not want any other excuses. 
  This issue has someething to do with some psychological 
reasons. Someone might contend that he is making field visits. 
Nonetheless, I would like to answer him, saying that working at 
his ministry is more important to me than making his field 
visits. I am well aware of the value of field visits. My 
rationale in this regard is that once the ministry employees 
feel that their minister reports to his ministry at 0800, they 
will do their utmost to be there at 0800. But, if the minister 
arrives at his ministry at 1100, yawning, the director general 
will, in his turn, report to his office, yawning at 0900. As 
for the ministry's under secretary, he will report to the 
ministry a little bit later. He might report to his office at 
0930. Beginning with the chief of the Presidential Office, all 
Iraqi employees must report to work at 0800. There can be no 
excuse for those who might say that they slept late, and 
consequently woke up late. They have to sleep early. Those who 
were used to sleeping at 0200 must get used to sleeping at 0100. 
If they cannot sleep before 0200, they must wake up at 0500, or 
0600 until they get used to sleeping early after close of 
business. I am not saying this out of theoretical or 
imaginative conceptions of my own. I have applied this myself. 
Sometimes, I get busy for some reason or another. The reason 
might not be that important. I might stay up late until 0200. 
Nonetheless, I get up at 0500 or 0515. Right now, we must 
abandon the morning sleep, and report to work at 0800 so that 
all employees may see us. We must revive and reactivate the 
state. Can we not do this? 
  I have told you that we cannot forge legends. However, we 
can do this. I am pressing for early reporting to work for 
psychological reasons. Some of you might be working more hours 
than those I am demanding of them, which should begin at 0800. 
But what I am talking about is discipline, as well as the 
psychological aspect of state employees. The influence the 
minister has when he works a certain number of hours, or an 
additional number of hours is less than the influence he has 
when he reports to work on time. This is because in the latter 
case, all employees would feel that the minister reports to work 
on time, just like all ministry employees. 
  What I want to discuss in this meeting -- which has no 
agenda -- is the living conditions of our people, and some 
phenomena which I noticed in the state departments in general so 
that the brother ministers will work toward overcoming these 
phenomena once we reach agreement on them. 
  Regarding the people's standard of living, I will explain to 
you how I view prices so that you may not imagine that I am 
unaware of the minor details, and that being what I am will make 
me unaware of minor things in the life of the people, and that 
consequently, I would ask you for things that would appear 
illogical. 
  Price increases, except for those of the commodities listed 
on the ration card, are inevitable. Why? At the beginning of 
the blockade, the Ministry of Trade had its own stockpiles. In 
the same vein, citizens had their own stockpiles. A section of 
the society benefiting from this situation emerged. This is 
natural. It happens in all wars all over the world. It happens 
in socialist and capitalist countries alike. That is, people 
benefiting from the difficulties experienced by their countries 
do emerge. These people take advantage of the hardships that 
emerge in their countries. These people have emerged because the 
revenues they make are less in value than the efforts made. The 
greater part of these revenues is deemed illegal in terms of 
legitimacy, fairness, and religious rulings. These people are 
engaged in trade, using their possessions on the market in an 
unnatural manner. For instance, when one of them is offered a 
single commodity, and he has 300 million dinars with him, when, 
by God, he did not have 1,000 dinars with him in the past, let 
us say that this commodity is a car, and that it was offered for 
15 million dinars, he would say: Well, why not buy it at this 
price? So, these people are not engaged in exploitation only in 
their well-known areas. They have turned into a factor that 
increases the value of market commodities. I have cited this 
example to let you know that I am following up on people's 
lives. I am well aware that some people are saying that not a 
single dollar is being spent on agriculture. Nonetheless, there 
are two factors that are contributing to increases in the prices 
of agricultural produce. These factors have nothing to do with 
the traditional equation of supply and demand. The first factor 
concerns the comparison phenomenon, and its psychological 
impact. This prompts vendors to constantly demand higher 
prices. This is because they live in areas where they see the 
prices of chairs and any other commodities, for that matter, 
rising. Consequently, the okra vendor contends that his okra, 
compared to their chair, must be equal in value to the legs of 
the chair. That is why he demands a price equal to the value of 
the legs of the chair. 
  In addition to this psychological impact, you are well aware 
that the components of the society influence each other. We 
have taught our society that all are equal in their human value, 
and that there is no difference between the children of a 
minister, and those of a peasant. In the past, people used to 
wonder about the wide gap existing between different classes of 
the society. You recall that statements to this effect were 
made in alleyways, houses, and rural areas. Nowadays, this 
statement is no longer heard. As a matter of fact, children in 
rural areas are telling their fathers that the children of so 
and so minister or merchant are wearing a certain brand of 
clothes, and that they want the same brand of clothes. This 
psychological consciousness of the importance of equality, even 
though when it is only in form rather than substance, also plays 
a basic role in price increases. This is because this increases 
the obligations of people who have possessions for sale. This 
pushes in the direction that we have just mentioned. 
  Moreover, there is also the transport sector. We do not have 
new means of transport to augment the private sector's fleet, 
ensure adequacy in terms of transport capabilities, and allow 
fares to remain at certain levels, to make them stand still, or 
to reduce them. The number of vehicles in the country has 
remained unchanged, and so has the number of tires. Hence, if 
we only examine the transport factor, along with another factor; 
namely, that peasants do not all work with their own hands, 
particularly since many of them pay daily wages for workers, 
whose wages affect other workers' wages, we can come up with 
some conclusions. So, we can identify two factors, at least, in 
this regard. The first is a psychological and social factor, an 
indirectly economic one. The other is a directly economic 
factor. These two factors play a role in raising the prices of 
tomatoes, even though peasants are not importing chemical 
fertilizers for them from abroad, and although they do not pay 
the wages of plowing in dollars, not to mention the fact that 
some peasants lease their tractors and similar equipment. 
  What I want to say to you is that I am following up things 
and thinking them over as much as I can. Do not imagine that I 
am unaware of things. I follow up people's life. I want to say 
that we can do something, but what is it? 
  I prefer that we hold a dialogue about this, and that each 
of 
you makes his suggestions, hoping that you make these 
suggestions as brief and concise as possible. 
  The two deputy prime ministers and the ministers presented 
a number of ideas and proposals which were discussed. 
  The leader president then said: 
  The blockade will end just as any other issue. Wars have 
ended and there are still other wars. The blockade started on a 
certain day, and there must be a day when it will end. It is 
clear that the remaining time is less than the time which has 
elapsed. I believe that the expression we used before is 
accurate. However, the basis which will end the blockade, keep 
Iraq just as its sons want it to be, and end any strong storm 
with the fewest possible losses or ysacrifices, with the 
continuation of the basic constants wished by its sons, the 
people of the country, lies in the people of the country 
themselves. The basis lies in the people of the country. The 
responsibility increases gradually in accordance with the level 
of influence and center of influence among the people of the 
country. It is natural that the minister's responsibility of 
steadfastness differs from the responsibility of others. This 
means that the minister's sense of responsibility and the level 
and size of influence differs from that of the ordinary employee 
or citizen in the state of Iraq. Thus, this includes members of 
the leadership, beginning with the ministry's under secretary, 
the director general, and ends with the end of the job scale. 
  From the beginning we said that the basis that will fragment 
or lift the blockade is you. Why you? Because the more you 
increase your people's patience and ability to stand fast, the 
more this will be in your favor to end the blockade in an 
honorable way. Praise be to God that the country's 
capabilities, its sons' capacity, and the level of their 
awareness have remained intact regardless of the reckless 
outbursts brought about by a quick assessment, or a quick or 
hasty stand. I know the national essence of the people of the 
country. They understand that they have no other choice. This 
is how the situation can be decided the way we wish. The 
ministers, when they increase their activity in their offices 
and make their mental and organizational ability more efficient 
and more effective, will play a role in increasing the patience 
of the citizen, whether he is an employee or something else. 
  It seems that some sides mobilized the people in a way which 
was interpreted as if the Iraqis should wait for good news, in a 
dramatic sense, after the meeting, the UN Security Council's 
meeting which was held in May. This is wrong and is contrary to 
our policy. Our policy says that we are working in the 
international arena with all our capabilities and mental 
abilities. However, the basis which changes the international 
approach is the Iraqis' position. The Iraqis weaken their 
position in the international arena when they grumble too much 
and when their balance of patience is disrupted. They weaken 
their position in the international community, which has a 
purpose. Even he who has no purpose will no longer be 
enthusiastic about insisting on shortening the time for lifting 
the blockade when he sees the people's resistance against the 
blockade has become weak. 
  At any rate, when they tell you that prices are high, tell 
them that we are working to mitigate their impact on you. But, 
what is the alternative you have? Give it to us. When they 
tell you that prices are high, and that there must be 
restrictions, tell them: Okay. But ask them the following 
question: If we were to set the prices for tomatoes, will you 
refrain from buying them except at the prices set by the state, 
or will you carry your bags and buy them regardless of the 
prices set for them? But, if you want the state organs to 
engage in a battle with a single sector of our people, while you 
stand idly and buy from it, I would like to say that this is 
unacceptable. Similarly, it is unacceptable for some of them to 
utter the well-known Iraqi phrase: By God, you have the right 
to do so. Vendors are telling you that transportation is 
costly, etcetera. For those who say that they are not happy 
with prices, we would like to say that we are willing to 
transfer all powers of state organs to the concerned popular 
councils and neighborhood residents so that they may set their 
own prices and go by them. But, if they want the security organs 
to carry out pursuit operations, imprison people, and batter 
them for any violations, minor violations, when they refrain 
from demonstrating cooperation to promote their own interests, I 
would like to say that this is not going to be our own major 
battle. Tell them that these phenomena are harmful to us and 
you alike, and that what pains you pains our hearts. But, tell 
us what is the thing that we are withholding from you, and 
keeping from you in the circumstances of this crisis. Tell us 
what it is that we can do, and have failed to identify; that is, 
let us engage in a dialogue with them. We are supposed to 
identify proper procedures and mistakes in the suggestions that 
could be made by the director general or the ministry's under 
secretary. We must engage in a dialogue on the issues that we 
understand in our capacity as ministers. Likewise, we must 
identify proper procedures and mistakes in their conceptions. 
We must discuss proper measures at our council, regardless of 
whether they were enunciated by laymen or responsible officials. 
We must correct mistakes. Are you convinced that all ranking 
officials in the state, the party, and the society are playing 
their roles in terms of explaining to citizens mistakes and 
sound thinking in their conceptions and behavior? Are we 
incapable of correcting the citizens' conceptions? I would say 
that we are capable of doing so. 
  Our citizens have a nationalist nature. They can hear facts, 
and therefore, we must clarify facts to them in order for them 
to be balanced. They have been used to this issue since 1969. 
When onions, potatoes, or tomatoes become scarce, they make an 
issue out of this, and when we give them a solution by the 
available means, all of them will stand in the right position. 
So, let's do so and rely on God. 
  At the end of the meeting, specialized committees were 
formed 
to study some urgent issues. The results of their actions will 
be presented to the Council of Ministers soon.

<F P=106> [Report by Zuhayr Qusaybati: "Talabani Tells AL-HAYAH: </F>
Revolutionary Guard Backing Barzani and Hizballah Forces"] 
  [Excerpts] London -- Clashes have broken out in north Iraq 
again. Jalal Talabani, secretary general of the Patriotic Union 
of Kurdistan [PUK], has told AL-HAYAH that the Iranian 
Revolutionary Guard is supporting the Kurdistan Democratic Party 
[KDP], the Islamic Movement, and the Revolutionary Hizballah, 
which is led by Adham Barzani, with artillery and rocket 
bombardment. He told AL-HAYAH over the telephone from his 
residence in Damascus that Turkey has opened the border between 
Zakho and the 
  A spokesman for the KDP (led by Mas'ud Barzani) has rejected 
the accusation that the party is tacitly allying with the 
Islamic Movement. He accused the forces of Talabani's party of 
launching "three attacks on KDP positions on Tuesday 
night/Wednesday morning, thus violating the cease-fire" signed 
between Talabani's party and Mas'ud's party. 
  Talabani said that the KDP violated the agreement and 
attacked Halshu [as transliterated] in Qal'at Dizah (north Iraq) 
from the Iranian area of Sar Dasht on Wednesday, supported by 
the Islamic Movement and Revolutionary Hizballah. The 
Revolutionary Guard offered artillery and rocket support. He 
added that KDP forces "launched an attack last Monday in the 
al-Jabal al-Ahmar area, Kalaw Qasim [as transliterated], and 
Bani Haris, and that the attack was repulsed." 
  He pointed out that "Iranian intervention" in the fighting 
in 
the Iraqi-Iranian border areas "is now clear. We have requested 
authorities in Tehran to stop sending groups into our areas, but 
to no avail." [passage omitted] 
  Talabani accused Barzani's party of preventing the delivery 
of food and medical supplies from Zakho to Irbil, 
al-Sulaymaniyah, and Karkuk. He said that he had addressed "an 
appeal to Barzani to prevent the violation of the cease-fire 
agreement," [passage omitted] 
  In the same context Hushyar Zibari, member of the KDP 
Political Bureau and the Kurdish administration's representative 
in Britain, has denied that "the Revolutionary Guard has 
infiltrated into Iraqi Kurdistan." Zibari told AL-HAYAH over 
the telephone from Washington yesterday that linking Iran and 
Islamic movements with the issue (fighting) is like throwing 
dust in the eyes." He said: "We challenge the Patriotic Union 
to show us any of the Revolutionary Guard elements said to have 
been captured." He described the fears that Talabani might be 
attacked as "delusions which do not justify delaying his return" 
to north Iraq. He stressed that Barzani "telephoned Talabani 
and sent him messages asking him to speed up his return and 
guaranteeing his safety, but he (Talabani) always changes his 
mind." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Al-Sulaymaniyah, northern Iraq, 1 Jun 
(INA)--Fighting between the agent gangs in Iraqi Kurdistan has 
continued despite the cease-fire agreement reached the day 
before yesterday between the groups of the two agents, Mas'ud 
Barzani and Jalal Talabani. 
  The failure of the agreement, which was signed on 30 May in 
the town of Silopi on Turkish territory, is considered a 
political disaster for the two agent gangs after two months of 
fighting. 
  Citing eyewitnesses today, AL-JUMHURIYAH said that no sooner 
had the Barzanis and Talabanis signed their agreement in the 
presence of a Turkish Foreign Ministry representative than 
intensive and large- scale battles began in Irbil, which had 
been free of clashes over the previous month of military 
operations. The paper said that the fighting began in Hamlah 
(Sitafan), [parenthesis as received], which is the area where 
the Barzanis hold their conferences and conspiratorial meetings. 
The fighting then extended to Saydarah, al-Iskan al-Jumhuri, 
Azadi, Zanyari, Tayruh, Shurash, Mustawfa, al-'Arab, Ta'jil, 
Shawari', al-Salmubata, Salah al-Din, Shihallah, Fatkawah, and 
Aynkawah crossing. [all placenames as received] 
  Both light and heavy weapons were used and random shelling 
reached all areas near Irbil. The battles resulted in the 
occupation by the agent Talabani forces of the main offices of 
BARAYAHTI [name as received] newspaper which is issued by the 
Kurdistan Democratic Party, who took control of the offices of 
the KDP's second local committee. 
  On the other hand, the Barzani forces took over the 
committee 
6, 8, and 9 [as received] and the offices of the KURDISTANI TOY 
newspaper and part of the offices of the Barzani group on the 
'Aynkawah road. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH cites eyewitnesses as saying that hospitals 
under the control of Barzani and Talabani did not receive the 
wounded, despite their great number, and the citizens could not 
treat the injured as a result of fighting and random shelling. 
The fighting forced thousands to leave their homes for safer 
places. 
  The paper said that Irbil and the adjoining areas are living 
in anarchy, fear, and great tension.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Hani Wuhayyib: "Sense of Frustration"] </F>
  [Text] Western media channels are busy these days with 
reports about the fighting between the agents in the northern 
part of the homeland. These channels, especially BBC radio, 
cannot not hide their anxiety about those incidents. The 
anxiety expressed by the BBC is on behalf of the Western 
governments that are protecting the "security zone" and are 
frustrated by the subversive behavior, as the radio says. 
  In its comments and roundtable discussions, the BBC 
attributes Western anxiety to the fact that the agent groups are 
more concerned about their own rivalry than about what the West 
thinks about what is taking place. So, the West suddenly wakes 
up to the reality of what is taking place in the northern part 
of the homeland and expresses its sense of frustration, not out 
of affection for the citizens in northern Iraq but due to the 
exposure of its claims about the "security zone," which has 
turned into an open arena for crimes of murder, plunder, and 
fighting between the leaders of agent groups over plots of land 
and commissions, as the BBC says. The radio clearly admits that 
thousands of Kurds have come out in the streets of Irbil 
protesting against these crimes. 
  No doubt, our Kurdish people's rejection of the agent groups 
has strengthened the sense of frustration among Western 
governments, which are now convinced that the land has begun to 
move under the feet of the agents and traitors in the Kurdistan 
Autonomous Region -- hence the overlords' sense of frustration 
about the fate that awaits their agents and followers.

<F P=106> [Interview with Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Ehud Baraq </F>
by Alon Ben-David, at an Armored Corps gathering in Latrun on 2 
June -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Baraq] After midnight last night, the air force 
attacked a Hizballah training base from which terrorists come to 
kill IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and SLA [South Lebanese Army] 
soldiers in the security zone. We simply acted on the rule: 
Get up before your murderer and kill him first. It was a very 
successful action based on pinpointed air force activity and the 
precise intelligence we have lately had on Hizballah activity in 
the al- Biqa'. The outcome is several dozen terrorists killed 
-- apparently 30 -- and about 60 casualties. In response to 
that activity, Hizballah fired several Katyusha volleys on the 
western Galilee. In some areas of the north, inhabitants are 
spending the night in underground shelters and security rooms. 
We will deal with any developments as necessary. 
  [Ben-David] Was the Katyusha shelling a violation of the 
understandings in Lebanon, and will the IDF respond to it? 
  [Baraq] There is no doubt that Katyusha shelling inside 
Israel is a grave violation of the understandings reached after 
Operation Accountability. We have no interest in escalating the 
situation for its own sake. The blow Hizballah received is one 
of hardest it has sustained in recent years. If they continue 
to act against us, we will know what to do, and we have a wide 
range of measures to use. 
  [Qol Yisra'el correspondent Karmela Menashe] Do you think 
that the attack in an area under Syrian control can lead to an 
escalation in relations with Syria? 
  [Baraq] We attack Hizballah wherever they are. I am sure it 
is not the last time we will have to take action and make use of 
the IDF's long arm to strike Hizballah, even in areas under 
Syrian control. That does not violate our understandings of 
what we are permitted to do. In my view, the Syrians understand 
that Hizballah is not immune to attack anywhere.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by political </F>
correspondent Gadi Sukenik on 2 June; place not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Rabin] It is an ongoing war. Whenever there is a 
opportunity to hit the terrorist organization Hizballah without 
necessarily harming civilians, we do so, and we will continue 
doing so. They violated the understandings and responded with 
Katyusha attacks on civilian targets on Israeli soil. The fact 
that there have been no casualties or damage up to this point 
does not change the fact that they violated the understandings. 
And if they continue, we will have to respond to the violations. 
  I presented the matter to the Americans via the ambassador 
here. It was the Americans who mediated the understandings. I 
prefer that they first try to arrange something within the 
framework of the understandings with Hizballah's patrons, the 
Syrians, but if this situation continues, we will not be able to 
abide it. 
  [Sukenik] What prevented Israel from hitting that base 
before? Why today? 
  [Rabin] We chose the right time because they are not always 
there. 
  [Sukenik] Did you take into account the possibility that the 
price for attacking that base might be painful if Katyushas harm 
Israelis? 
  [Rabin] Yes, because in harming them we harm those who in 
another week or two months will operate against us. [end 
recording] 
  [Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television Network in Hebrew on 
1700 
GMT on 2 June carries similar remarks by Prime Minister Rabin at 
an Armored Corps gathering in Latrun. Asked by correspondent 
'Imanu'el Rosen whether the air raid might harm negotiations 
with Syria, Rabin says in a recorded passage: "There is no tie 
between the political negotiations with Syria and our war 
against Hizballah. Hizballah is the one that initiates the 
attacks against the IDF [Israeli Defense Forces] and SLA [South 
Lebanese Army] in the security zone, therefore the war against 
it is not carried out by responding to an act, but through an 
ongoing war based on the understandings reached in the wake of 
Operation Accountability in July 1993."]

<F P=106> [Discussion between announcers Razi Barqay and Tamar Landau </F>
and political correspondent Udi Segal in the Tel Aviv studio -- 
live] 
  [Text] [Landau] Hello political correspondent Udi Segal. 
  [Segal] Good afternoon. 
  [Landau] What was the reaction in Jerusalem? 
  [Segal] Officials in Jerusalem say that the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] attack in Lebanon did not constitute a violation 
of the understandings reached after Operation Accountability 
since no civilian were hurt and the only casualties were among 
Hizballah fighters. 
  [Landau] Although the attack was north of the security zone. 
  [Segal] Yes, but officials in Jerusalem said this 
constituted no violation. Nevertheless, we have learned that 
although not all the cabinet ministers supported this morning's 
raid, Hizballah's counterfire with Katyusha rockets at Israeli 
territory is unanimously regarded as a violation of the 
agreement. This is not new. Hizballah has already violated the 
agreement two or three times. Several political sources 
nevertheless said that the situation was still better than the 
one existing prior to Operation Accountability, which led to 
last year's military operation along Israel's northern border. 
  [Landau] Do you know if the IDF is considering a 
counterattack? 
  [Segal] Defense sources have said that the shelling proves 
that we are actively engaged in a war against terrorism. This 
results from political, strategic, military, and operational 
considerations and any reaction by Hizballah is carefully 
studied at the military and political levels before being 
approved. 
  [Barqay] Mordekhay Gur earlier said that Hizballah's attack 
constituted a flagrant violation of the agreements. Second, the 
IDF's operation this morning is not viewed as a violation. Let 
us now move on to political developments which continue 
regardless of the exacerbation along Israel's northern border. 
You have just learned that Shim'on Peres will make a stopover 
in Rabat on his way back from South America. 
  [Segal] Yes, we just pulled in that report a short while 
ago. Shim'on Peres is due to arrive in Rabat, the capital of 
Morocco, this evening. This has been confirmed by political 
sources in Jerusalem. Peres is scheduled to meet with King 
Hassan in a bid to promote the opening of a joint interest and 
liaison office in the Moroccan capital. This office will serve 
as a kind of low-level diplomatic representation. 
  Negotiations between officials in Rabat and Jerusalem have 
been conducted over the past few months. As we reported on IDF 
Radio, a proposal that Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin himself fly 
to Morocco was considered approximately one month ago. Foreign 
Minister Peres was slated to fly to Morocco afterwards but 
canceled his visit after the Moroccans expressed opposition. 
The Moroccan Government has still not given Israel a green 
light for the visit. 
  Over the past week, negotiations were conducted on several 
levels by David Adon, the director of the Israel-Arab department 
at the Foreign Ministry, who has spent the past few days in 
Morocco. Labor Knesset Member Rafi Edri is also in the Moroccan 
capital in an attempt to establish initial steps toward 
normalization. There is no guarantee that Peres' visit will 
induce the Moroccan king to support such a move but Foreign 
Ministry officials are hopeful that some progress will be made. 
  A Foreign Ministry delegation, led by 'Oded 'Eran, the 
assistant director general in charge of economics, will arrive 
in Rabat on Sunday [5 June] in order to prepare the multilateral 
talks due to begin in approximately two weeks. This delegation 
will also hold political talks. 
  [Barqay] Thank you, Udi Segal.

  [Text] Yasir 'Arafat has officially asked the Jordanian 
Government to allow hundreds of his supporters to escort him in 
a festive march on the day he visits Jericho. According to 
Palestinian sources, the visit will take place on 7 June, the 
day on which the West Bank was occupied in 1967. Interviewed by 
IDF Radio this morning, Knesset Member [MK] Hanan Porat of the 
National Religious Party said he would welcome any attempt to 
assassinate 'Arafat when he visits Jericho. Porat was 
interviewed by our correspondent Itay Engel. 
  [Begin recording] [Engel] Hanan Porat, would you not like 
to meet Yasir 'Arafat? 
  [Porat] No, absolutely not. I would not like to meet him. 
I do not think he is a partner or interlocutor of Israel. He 
is a man of terror whose hands are tainted with blood. A man 
who continues to talk about a jihad for Jerusalem is not my 
interlocutor. I am prepared to meet him only looking down the 
barrel of a gun. 
  [Engel] Should I infer from your remarks that if a gun sight 
were aimed at this man when he arrives in Jericho, you would 
find it acceptable and would even encourage it? 
  [Porat] I would congratulate anybody who does it, and I am 
saying this with the utmost resolve. You know, sometimes we 
tend to behave like doormats. If you ask me, however, what is 
the proper and deserving thing to do to this man called Yasir 
'Arafat, he deserves a bullet in the head. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Me'ir Shalev: "'Arafat's Kanafah"] </F>
  [Text] It is really a joy. The pathetic buffoon 'Arafat 
spews out nonsense, and a chorus of fools here vigorously takes 
his words as if they were the gospel. In view of the recent 
deluge of learned theological studies about the chairman's 
absurdities, I am surprised that nobody paid any attention to 
yet another of the man's utterances. Well, a week ago, Yasir 
'Arafat was overheard telling his wife during breakfast: "Suha 
darling, please pass me a piece of kanafah" [an Oriental pastry]. 
  On the face of it, this would seem to be the type of 
innocuous sentence that could be heard at any Arab breakfast 
table. In fact, it was another sly manifestation of the weak 
legs on which the agreement with the PLO stands. After all, any 
Muslim child will tell you what the "kanafah massacre" was. In 
the course of his fight over the creation of the Koran, Caliph 
al-Mamun with his typical cunning invited his opponents to a 
reconciliation banquet and beguilingly offered them kanafah for 
dessert. As is known, kanafah is the heaviest element on earth. 
(For example, the specific gravity of kanafah is four times 
that of lead and twice that of cholent). His opponents ate the 
kanafah and could not get up from their seats. Caliph al-Mamun 
slaughtered them in their chairs. Incidentally, this was not 
the only time this happened: In the 19th century, Hamad, the 
mahdi of Khartoum, eliminated his adversaries by tying a piece 
of kanafah around their necks and throwing them in the Nile. 
There is no doubt that when 'Arafat asked Suha to pass the 
kanafah he was hinting at a massacre of the Jews. 
  However, what Chairman 'Arafat really had in mind when he 
mentioned the word kanafah was the "Allah's Hand Controversy" in 
Baghdad in the year 400 of the hegira between the Kharijites and 
the Qadiris. The Kharijites argued that only the hand of Allah, 
at his will, can determine what happens in the world. In 
contrast, the Qadiris believed in the people's right to choose 
and act. The analogy is clear: 'Arafat believes that Suha's 
hand, not just Allah's, can move the kanafah from one end of the 
table to the other. All this leads to the conclusion that the 
man has the right to choose and to act and cannot be stopped 
from violating the agreement he signed with Israel. 
  I hope I have made my point quite clear. I hope Israel will 
put 'Arafat in his place and will unequivocally inform him that 
if he utters the word "kanafah" once again we will return to our 
Gaza.

  [Text] Israel Aircraft Industries [IAI] is operating 
special production lines to produce artillery shells for use by 
Eastern European armies. This fact was revealed yesterday at 
the opening of the Israeli pavilion at the military fair in Brno 
in the Czech Republic. Procurement backorders from Eastern 
Europe currently total approximately $100 million. 
  IAI has marked Eastern Europe as a major target for the 
export of military systems. On the basis of orders submitted by 
several Eastern European armies, IAI has begun to produce 
artillery and tank shells in order to replace the ammunition 
that was supplied to these countries in the past by the former 
Soviet Union. Among other steps, IAI has developed an 
accelerated production line for 100 mm shells for T-55 tanks and 
125 mm shells for T-72 models. Artillery shells have also been 
developed, including state-of-the-art cluster shells, both 130 
mm and 152 mm in diameter. 
  IAI is also selling machine guns, assault rifles, and 
handguns to Eastern Europe. Contacts are underway for 
additional deals. 
  Eleven Israeli companies are exhibiting their wares at the 
Brno military fair, including the IAI, REFA'EL [Armament 
Development Authority], Tadiran, El-Op, Elbit, and Elisra, which 
produces electronic systems and sophisticated weapon systems. 
  Senior Czech Army officials and senior representatives of 
other Eastern European armies are expected to visit the fair 
during the four days it is held.

<F P=106> ["Text" of an interview with Prime Minister Dr. </F>
'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali by Ahmad al-Hisban "published today in 
AL-DUSTUR and the Lebanese magazine AL-USBU' AL-'ARABI;" place 
and date not given] 
  [Text] [Al-Hisban] Let us begin with the most important 
issue in the arena; namely, the relationship between Jordan and 
the self-rule authority. What is the Jordanian concept of this 
relationship? 
  [Al-Majali] First, we must reiterate the existence of a 
special and distinguished relationship between Jordan and the 
Palestinian brothers for many old, present, and future reasons. 
We support the PLO, the sole and legitimate representative of 
the Palestinian people, and do not interfere in its internal 
affairs. We also hope it will not interfere in our internal 
affairs. 
  We will deal with it the same way we deal with a friend, 
dear 
neighbor, and honorable brother. Therefore, we wish it all 
success. We believe that it has achieved an advanced step, and 
hope it will succeed in achieving other steps. We also hope the 
Palestinian people will achieve their genuine right to 
self-determination. 
  We also believe that once the Palestinian people have 
achieved this right, they will freely call for establishing a 
special kind of relationship with Jordan. Things will then be 
addressed in an appropriate way. 
  [Al-Hisban] A new reality has been established on the 
popular 
level. There are Palestinians and there are Jordanians. Who is 
the Jordanian and who is the Palestinian in light of this new 
reality? 
  [Al-Majali] The people who carry Jordanian citizenship and 
believe in the Jordanian system and state are Jordanians. This 
is our Constitution and this is justice. There is no difference 
between a person from a Palestinian or non-Palestinian origin. 
The important thing is that the one who carries Jordanian 
citizenship and believes in the country is considered a 
Jordanian. 
  [Al-Hisban] Will those who carry the five-year passports be 
given the freedom to make their choice? 
  [Al-Majali] Of course. They are Jordanians, and no force on 
earth can tell them otherwise. However, those people have the 
right to choose another citizenship. 
  We all know that the rights that were given to the refugees 
who came to Jordan were in fact a trust to enable them regain 
their rights and lands. 
  [Al-Hisban] What about those who carry two-year temporary 
passports? 
  [Al-Majali] As you know, these are temporary passports that 
were issued to serve the Palestinian brothers who were living in 
the West Bank at a certain time or the West Bankers who were 
living outside the West Bank. Those people were issued these 
passports to facilitate their work and make life easier for 
them. Regarding those people, if the PLO or the Palestinian 
authority decide to issue passports I believe they will be 
issued passports and their issue will be resolved. 
  [Al-Hisban] In light of the recent bridge measures, the 
Jordanian interior minister said that the danger of displacement 
has ended. Do you believe that this danger has really ended? 
  [Al-Majali] I believe so, particularly since the situation 
inside the occupied territory has become different. The 
displacement is either by force or voluntarily. Now that a 
Palestinian entity has been established, the brothers who will 
be living in this entity will not be subject to the pressures to 
which they were exposed in the past. Furthermore, the occupied 
territory should enjoy a very good economic situation. So, why 
would they emigrate? 
  I believe that all causes of emigration will end. So, why 
should we fear its continuation? The measures that were taken 
came in light of the change that took place on the ground. 
These measures aim at facilitating the movement of our brother 
from one side to another. 
  [Al-Hisban] Concerning the issue of displacement, the 
Lebanese proposed a plan to solve the problem of Palestinian 
refugees in Lebanon. I believe this plan is based on settling 
20 percent [in Lebanon], returning 20 percent [to the occupied 
territory], and displacing 60 percent. It has also been 
reported that a percentage of those displaced will be settled in 
Jordan. 
  [Al-Majali] I have never heard of such a thing. If there are 
proposals to this effect, I do not believe it is a matter of 20 
percent or any other percentage. 
  The issue of refugees must be resolved within an 
international framework. Jordan is the country that hosts the 
largest number of refugees. So, is it reasonable to increase 
their number here, particularly since Jordan's resources are 
limited? This is not logical. We cannot speak about this 
before deciding the issue of refugees within the multilateral 
and bilateral talks. 
  [Al-Hisban] Has Nabih Birri, speaker of the Lebanese Chamber 
of Deputies, presented any ideas in this regard? 
  [Al-Majali] Not at all. He has proposed nothing, because 
there is nothing between Jordan and Lebanon with regard to the 
issue of refugees. The press, however, is fabricating stories 
on this issue. This is a Lebanese and Palestinian matter. 
Jordan has nothing to do with it. 
  [Al-Hisban] It has been reported that the 
Jordanian-Palestinian economic agreement has been obstructed 
because of some points in it. Do you believe this is caused by 
the Palestinian-Israeli economic agreement? 
  [Al-Majali] Those points were addressed following the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement. There was an agreement on most 
of the points, in fact, on all of them. Following the 
agreement, the Palestinian side asked for more time to discuss 
two points and then to respond to them. We hope this will take 
place as soon as possible. 
  [Al-Hisban] So far, how do you appraise what has been 
reached 
with the Palestinian side? 
  [Al-Majali] What has been achieved is good, responsible, and 
promising. We must realize that the brothers do not have full 
freedom to act in the economic arena. This is a transitional, 
not a final, phase. In the final phase, we will talk with the 
Palestinian brothers on different issues. We will hold talks 
with the Palestinian brothers and the Israelis on the economic 
issues that concern the three parties. We should wait to see 
what will happen in the future. 
  [Al-Hisban] Regarding inter-Arab relations, you proposed a 
rescheduling of Arab differences. What is new in this regard? 
  [Al-Majali] We hope for this. It would be better if we could 
put our differences aside and cooperate to end the bloodshed in 
Yemen. Is this issue not worth an Arab meeting? Therefore, I 
reiterate that the only way is to reschedule our differences. 
We do not deny the existence of differences, however, the 
present time is not a suitable one to talk about them. We can 
say that there are no differences over 99 percent of the issues. 
So, why do we not stick to these points and close ranks to face 
the current challenges in the region? 
  I believe that the best thing is to agree that there are 
differences, but the solution should come after three to four 
years. Meanwhile, we should continue cooperation. 
  [Al-Hisban] Some analyses indicate that Jordan has been 
somewhat isolated due to many intransigent positions toward it? 
  [Al-Majali] It is rather the opposite. Except for two 
brothers with whom some estrangement still exists, all other 
Arab states are enjoying a good deal of amity. These two 
brothers believe that differences should be resolved now. We 
are ready for this but the circumstances are not opportune, and 
we can postpone discussing our differences and document what has 
been agreed. 
  [Al-Hisban] What about the siege of al-'Aqabah? 
  [Al-Majali] It is almost over, and is in its final stages. 
  [Al-Hisban] It is said, however, that there are differences 
over who will pay the costs? 
  [Al-Majali] The costs will be paid by the parties concerned, 
and there is a special fund to compensate for all repercussions 
of the Gulf war. Cash, however, is not available, so Jordan is 
entitled to retrieve the costs it may have paid. 
  [Al-Hisban] It was said that bilateral negotiations will 
resume at the end of April. We are now at the end of May, and 
they have not yet resumed? 
  [Al-Majali] As you know, the negotiations were suspended due 
to the Hebron events, after which a Palestinian-Israeli 
agreement was signed. There are now attempts to activate the 
Syrian track in one way or another through U.S. mediation. If 
we are invited once the simple points with the brothers in Syria 
are resolved, we will proceed forward. 
  [Al-Hisban] There are rumors about a reshuffle in your 
cabinet? 
  [Al-Majali] Each cabinet reconsiders its formation and tries 
to renew itself. This is a routine matter. At this time, 
however, there is no reshuffle. 
  [Al-Hisban] The [Government's] relationship with the House 
of Representatives saw some tension at first. Afterward, it 
became stable, but, apparently, some tension has surfaced again? 
  [Al-Majali] There is no tension between us and the deputies. 
Naturally, the House of Representatives is a new house and most 
of it consists of friends who have their own attitudes. 
However, they are, in one way or another, unfamiliar with the 
issue of representation. Thus, it is natural for such things to 
happen in the first round of sessions. However, with the 
passage of time, everyone would be convinced that all are 
working for the public interest. Convergence is the predominant 
feature. But if we search for differences and conflicts, we can 
find them. Likewise, if we search for convergence, we can find 
it. 
  In fact, there was no conflict. There is another viewpoint, 
and this usually happens. We do not expect the deputies to 
accept everything the Government submits. If they do so, the 
House would no longer be necessary. 
  [Al-Hisban] Your cabinet raised the idea of a separation 
among the branches of authority. Is this principle still valid? 
  [Al-Majali] I believe this is a principle. His Majesty King 
Husayn has frequently referred to it. Separation of powers is a 
basic issue, so no branch will encroach on another in any way 
whatsoever. This, however, does not at all mean that a deputy 
is prohibited from being a minister. There is no decision that 
this matter is absolutely banned. 
  [Al-Hisban] King Husayn has criticized the Jordanian media, 
however, no radical changes have thus far happened. 
  [Al-Majali] Do the ones who demand a radical change believe 
that such a change should be made in the people or in the 
policies? 
  [Al-Hisban] I believe the change should be made in policies. 
  [Al-Majali] The policy exists and it is clear but those who 
carry it out are human beings and sometimes make mistakes. We 
want the highest level of performance, but our potential is 
limited. 
  [Al-Hisban] Let us return to the issue of negotiations. Is 
there any comprehensive solution to what is taking place in the 
arena? 
  [Al-Majali] Every one talks about and believes in a 
comprehensive solution, but also agrees that progress differs 
from one track to another because each track has its own 
circumstances. The Palestinian track has only managed to secure 
a document covering the first period. In other words, the 
Palestinian track began late, at a point from where we started 
two years ago. Can we say that it moved alone? The answer is 
no, because its problems and issues are different. In light of 
the agenda, we could have made rapid progress, but when we felt 
that other sides slowed down their moves, we stopped for a 
while. The same applies to the Syrian and Lebanese brothers. 
  Coordination exists, and we all believe in the comprehensive 
solution. There are no unilateral moves, and we are 
coordinating with each other because it is in the interest of 
everybody to reach a comprehensive solution. 
  [Al-Hisban] Following the recent measures on the bridges and 
the recent visits to Jordan by several delegations, several 
semi-official Palestinian statements indicated that Jordan was 
clearing the way to retreat from its disengagement decision in 
one way or another. 
  [Al-Majali] The disengagement took place, the entity has 
been 
established, and retreat from disengagement is not considered at 
all. Whether we want it or not, the issue is out of the 
question. The entity has been established, the Palestinian 
police have entered, and an agreement was signed with Israel. 
Despite all this, some people say Jordan wants to retreat from 
its disengagement decision. Of course, those who do not like 
Jordanian-Palestinian detente and those who want to fish in 
murky water and create problems are spreading such ideas. But 
Jordan does all it can for the Palestinian brothers. Regarding 
the delegations, you know that His Majesty King Husayn was 
distressed by the tragic loss of the Queen Mother, and these 
delegations came just to extend their condolences. How can we 
explain feelings in light of politics? 
  [Al-Hisban] You promised to increase salaries after the 
endorsement of the sales tax law. The law has been endorsed. 
Is there any plan for such an increase? 
  [Al-Majali] We wanted to reach a radical solution to the 
conditions of government employees, but this needs enough money, 
which is not available. However, there will be a solution that 
will improve their conditions, but not a radical one. 
  [Al-Hisban] One year after the formation of your government, 
what are your major accomplishments in which you can take pride? 
  [Al-Majali] I cannot talk about my accomplishments and those 
of may government. Everybody believes his accomplishments to be 
the best. It is you who should talk about what you see.

  [Text] Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali has 
received at his office the UNRWA [United Nations Relief and 
Works Agency] high commissioner and heads of delegates 
participating in the unofficial meeting of the representatives 
of the major donor countries for UNRWA and the refugees hosting 
countries currently held in Amman. 
  During the audience, the premier has underlined the 
importance of work at this stage to guarantee the continuity of 
UNRWA to work and promote its services offered to Palestinian 
refugees until a permanent and just settlement for their cause 
is reached. 
  Dr. al-Majali urged the donor countries to increase their 
donations, provide more support for UNRWA, and increase their 
contribution in its budget to enable it carry out its role. 
  The prime minister said that all refugees should receive the 
same treatment in the hosting countries without any 
discrimination as their cause is one and their basic needs are 
identical regardless of their location. 
  He urged the UNRWA to provide more services for the 
Palestinian refugees as Jordan is hosting the biggest number of 
Palestinian refugees and incurring heavy financial burdens, 
especially in the fields of health and education.

  [Text] Some 61 Jordanian journalists and writers have sent 
a memorandum of protest to Information Minister Dr. Jawad 
al-'Anani against the Jordanian official media's coverage of 
Yemeni developments. 
  The memorandum said that the coverage is biased and 
contradicts the Jordanian official position and role as a 
sponsor of the accord document. This coverage will also not 
help Jordan to play a role in the future as an honest broker and 
a friend of all Yemeni forces. 
  The memorandum demanded that the official media stop showing 
bias.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "To Preserve Yemen's Unity First"] </F>
  [Text] The attempts to internationalize the crisis of 
fraternal Yemen should be stopped immediately and without 
hesitation. This is because these suspect attempts imply a 
noteworthy encouragement of the secessionist tendency as a 
prelude to fragmenting the Yemeni homeland and people. 
  If the UN Security Council interferes in Yemen's internal 
affairs, it might decide to send international troops to Yemeni 
territory, which is similar to what the Security Council did in 
Somalia and other areas. We believe that the bitter and 
difficult experience in Somalia was sufficient for the Arabs to 
learn the necessary lesson and stop inviting foreign states and 
forces, whether friendly or hostile, to interfere in Arab 
affairs. 
  All Arab states and parties should know that foreign 
military 
and political interference will not be in favor of Yemen, its 
national unity, or its territorial integrity. If the Arab 
League really cares for halting the destructive war in Yemen, it 
should activate the stipulations and articles of its charter and 
abide by its by-laws, all of which provide for resolving any 
Arab crisis inside, and not outside, the Arab house. 
  The Arab League should also make all necessary efforts and 
moves in order to foil the secessionist tendency among the 
southern Yemeni leaders and urge them to commit themselves to 
legitimacy and unity. 
  No Arab party supports the continuation of the ongoing war 
between the brothers in Yemen because it is a destructive war 
that will inflict grave damage on the Yemeni economy and its 
infrastructure and superstructure. All Arab states should make 
serious and responsible initiatives to halt this war, extinguish 
its fire, and stop the Yemeni bloodshed. They should also 
stress the protection of Yemeni unity, respect for legitimacy, 
and the prevention of any foreign interference in the affairs of 
this fraternal Arab country. 
  A real solution to the Yemeni crisis is one that would 
safeguard the Yemeni people's unity and preserve Yemen's 
territorial integrity. Such a solution will not be provided by 
any form of foreign interference or internationalization of the 
crisis.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Meaningless Moves"] </F>
  [Text] During their repeated tours of the Middle East, 
U.S. and Russian officials have shown eagerness to emphasize 
that the two large co-sponsors of the regional peace process 
want to promote this process and remove it from the critical 
atmosphere that has overwhelmed it. They also stress that the 
success of this peace process depends on commitment to the basic 
principles stipulated in the Madrid conference that unleashed 
the peace negotiations between Israel and the Arab parties 
directly concerned with the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
  If we review what the peace process has thus far achieved, 
we 
will simply find that it continues to face one major obstacle, 
represented by the issue of Israeli withdrawal from the occupied 
Arab territories. Such a withdrawal is a basic principle. 
Peace cannot be achieved or entrenched without implementing 
this principle in accordance with the resolutions of 
international legitimacy, particularly Resolutions 242 and 338. 
Moreover, without a full and comprehensive Israeli withdrawal 
from all occupied Arab territories, any talk about peace will 
continue to move in a vicious circle, so any achievement on the 
path of peace will merely be like building peace on sand. 
  The repeated visits to the region by the U.S. secretary of 
state and the Russian envoys, as well as the continued 
consultations held bilaterally and collectively as part of the 
bilateral and multilateral negotiations, have thus far failed to 
effect a clear Israeli commitment to full withdrawal from the 
occupied territories. The issue of withdrawal is still part of 
the Israeli maneuvers designed to fragment the Arab side, set 
timetables, propose phased solutions, and give only in 
installments. This will deprive the land-for-peace principle of 
both the meaning and legitimacy according to which the peace 
process was launched in the first place. The issue of full 
withdrawal in exchange for full peace is an essential link in 
any comprehensive solution that will securely resolve all issues 
pertaining to both the Palestine question and the overall 
conflict in the Middle East. However, this fact, which is 
ignored by the U.S. and Russian co-sponsors, has failed to spare 
the peace efforts of the Israeli attempts designed to conclude 
partial and separate deals. 
  The emphasis by the U.S. and Russian governments on their 
good intentions, as well as the Arab parties' commitment to both 
the peace process and its principles, are not sufficient to 
force Israel into committing itself to the bases and principles 
of peace as long as such statements are nothing more than 
utterances of mere diplomacy. Political moves, whether U.S. or 
Russian, should be serious in order to promote the peace process 
in the right direction. These moves should be joined by the 
Israeli side, which rejects the concept of full withdrawal in 
exchange for comprehensive peace on all fronts of the conflict. 
Otherwise, the visits, moves, and tours will continue to 
revolve in a vicious circle of action and reaction, and they 
will never succeed in pushing the peace process forward.

  [Excerpt] Amman -- The government of Prime Minister 
'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali is moving ahead with its policy of 
removing legal and bureaucratic obstacles that stand in the face 
of new investors who wish to enter the previously protected 
sectors of the Jordanian economy, Minister of Trade and Industry 
Rima Khalaf said during a business luncheon with journalists and 
writers Saturday. 
  The minister said that the government's controversial 
amendments to the insurance law was the first step in that 
direction, and that this particular sector was chosen because it 
was the only one that was "legally protected" against the entry 
of new companies and investors. 
  Other sectors, the minister said, have become restricted 
"not 
because of legislative protection" but because the issuance of 
licences for new investors was a "dual responsibility" shared by 
the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the concerned government 
department or ministry which often has its own considerations 
and protection policies. 
  "The problem is that some of the industries which were 
protected in the years before 1988 were accorded protection 
against local competition and not only foreign competition," Ms. 
Khalaf said, adding that the government would gradually ease the 
restrictions and will terminate protection contracts when they 
expire. 
  "The policy of this government is openness. On the 
industrial level competition is the basis of our economy," Ms. 
Khalaf said, adding that Jordan should reach a point where "the 
market decides what stays and what goes." 
  "The banking sector, for example, was restricted because of 
Central Bank regulations and not because of trade and industry 
laws," Ms. Khalaf pointed out in response to a specific question 
on that sector. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Walid 'Asfur, minister of energy and mineral 
resources, has said the tenders for the power-linkage project 
between Jordan and Egypt -- a first stage in a comprehensive 
power grid linking Jordan, Syria, Iraq, Egypt, and Turkey -- 
will be submitted before the end of this year. The project is 
expected to be finished by 1997. 
  In a statement to the Jordanian News Agency, 'Asfur said the 
ministers of energy and electricity and the heads of delegations 
of the five-way power-linkage states stressed, at the conclusion 
of their meetings in Cairo recently, the need for power linkage 
between Jordan and Egypt as a basic, first stage in the 
comprehensive linkage between the five states. 
  He noted that it was agreed to give priority in financing 
the 
project to the implementation of the first stage. The Arab Fund 
for Economic and Social Development will finance the two parts 
of the Jordanian-Egyptian linkage; the two parts of the 
Jordanian-Syrian linkage; and the Syrian part of the 
Syrian-Turkish linkage. 
  'Asfur said the next ministerial meeting of the five-way 
power-linkage states will be held in Turkey in April next year.

<F P=106> [Report by Ayman al-Safadi] </F>
  [Text] Amman -- A draft law on youth welfare, which 
requires the segregation of sexes at "sports centres, including 
swimming pools," does not apply to hotels, public beaches or 
clubs, lawmakers asserted Monday. 
  Deputies said the draft law, which was endorsed by the Lower 
House of Parliament Saturday, only applies to commercial "sports 
training centres" and was meant to regulate this mushrooming 
industry which includes body building and martial arts training 
centres. 
  Former Minister of Youth, Deputy Salih Irshaydat told the 
JORDAN TIMES Monday that the draft legislation will not thus 
"change anything on the ground since sports training centres 
were built with the knowledge that they will be segregated." 
  "The youth welfare law has nothing to do with sports 
activities at clubs, hotels and touristic sites because the 
Ministry of Youth has no jurisdiction over these place," Dr. 
Irshaydat said. Tney are governed by separate laws and 
regulations, he said. 
  Islamic Action Front (IAF) Deputy 'Abd-al-Rahim al-'Ukur 
agreed with Dr. Irshaydat, saying the Islamists were only 
concerned with having training sports centres including swimming 
pools segregated. 
  "People who coach swimming should be of the same sex but we 
are not concerned with swimming pools at hotels and touristic 
areas," Dr. al-'Ukur said. 
  "We are aware of coeducation at universities and we are not 
trying to stop that or to segregate sexes at touristic sites," 
said Dr. al-'Ukur. 
  Echoing Dr. Irshaydat and Dr. al-'Ukur, Deputy 'Abdallah 
al-Nusur, confirmed that it is not within the jurisdiction of 
the Ministry of Youth to decide how hotels and touristic sites 
operate. 
  The House Sunday voted down an amendment by the Upper House 
of Parliament (the Senate) to delete the clause requiring the 
segregation of sexes at sports training centres. 
  Thirty-seven out of 64 deputies present at a session of the 
House Saturday voted in favour of maintaining the clause, which 
was introduced to the draft law by the Muslim Brotherhood bloc 
at the 11th Parliament in 1992. 
  Deputies said the Senate amendment was defeated because many 
of the "liberal deputies" who would have supported it were 
absent from the session. But they expected the clause to be 
dropped when the two houses meet in a joint session no later 
than two weeks to settle the issue. 
  The two Houses convene in a joint session when the Lower 
House turns down amendments by the Senate and the Upper House 
insists on its decision. Resolutions are taken by a two-third 
majority of the two Houses and it "should not be difficult to 
obtain this majority," 10 lawmakers said.

  [Excerpt] Beirut -- According to the latest counts, 
released at noon today, 45 persons were left martyred and 85 
others injured by the treacherous, savage Israeli warplanes' 
aggression against one of Ba'labakk's suburbs in the Lebanese 
al-Biqa' Valley. Hospital sources in Ba'labakk said that the 
number of martyrs is likely to increase because of the presence 
of serious injuries among the wounded. 
  In a statement on the brutal raid, Lebanese security sources 
said that at least three Israeli helicopters took part in this 
raid, using machine guns and rockets, and that other planes were 
flying at high altitudes to protect them. Reports say that 
Lebanese Army ground defenses confronted the raiding planes and 
prevented them from staging any landing. MENA said that a 
six-plane squadron was supporting the Israeli helicopters and 
dropped heat balloons in a precautionary measure to avoid the 
Lebanese army's ground defenses. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Information Minister Dr. Muhammad Salman asserted 
today that the recent escalation of Israeli aggressions on 
Lebanon is part of Israel's policy of organized state terrorism 
against Lebanon's sovereignty. 
  In an statement to Radio Monte Carlo, Dr. Salman said the 
timing of these aggressions is part of Israel's continued 
attempts to undermine the peace process and obstruct U.S. 
efforts that aim at ending the stalemate in the peace talks, 
which were launched in accordance with the Madrid frame of 
reference. He noted that the cause of the stalemate is Israel's 
hard-line approach that rejects full withdrawal from the 
occupied Arab territories in return for full peace.

  [Text] Rome -- The United States has reaffirmed its 
determination to continue its efforts to reactivate the Middle 
East peace process, particularly on the Syrian-Israeli track. 
  In an exclusive statement to a SANA correspondent in Rome 
yesterday, in answer to a question on Syrian-Israeli talks 
following Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's recent 
statements, Christopher said: I think that we are now 
discussing the forthcoming negotiations and when they may start. 
We are exerting efforts to facilitate these talks between Syria 
and Israel. 
  Christopher added: I think we are facing a new phase in 
these negotiations. I also think that the problem is whether we 
can fulfill that mission and how quickly we can do it. The 
beginning is always difficult. 
  SANA correspondent in Rome also asked U.S. White House 
Spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers a question about the Middle East 
issue. She said: Naturally, we support moves for peace in the 
Middle East. Some progress has been achieved in this regard, but 
there is still a long way to go and we are doing all we can to 
facilitate progress on all tracks. We hope we will continue to 
achieve further progress. The process is long and hard. 
  The U.S. spokeswoman noted Christopher's repeated tours of 
the Middle East. She said: The U.S. secretary of state has 
spent a great deal of time in the Middle East and has made 
several tours over a period of 16 months. We hope these tours 
have helped to achieve progress in the peace process during the 
past year. 
  The spokeswoman added: Early this year, President Bill 
Clinton said that he hoped there would be fresh momentum given 
to the peace process through any means available. But there are 
several obstacles and we are cautiously optimistic. However, no 
one should feel despair in face of this difficult process. 
  It is worth mentioning that Christopher and Dee Dee Myers 
are 
accompanying the U.S. President on his current visit to Italy.

<F P=106> [Report by Nabih al-Barji in Beirut] </F>
  [Text] Political sources close to Damascus in Beirut have 
said that Syrian officials were shocked by the decision of 
Edward Djerejian, the U.S. ambassador in Tel Aviv, to leave his 
post in order to pursue a possible election campaign that will 
be led by former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker to face 
U.S. President Bill Clinton in the White House battle. 
  Syrian officials had thought that the appointment of 
Djerejian, who had served as ambassador in Damascus before he 
was appointed assistant U.S. secretary of state for Middle 
Eastern affairs -- to head the U.S. diplomatic mission in Tel 
Aviv was a positive signal that the Clinton administration wants 
this seasoned diplomat, who is an expert on the Middle East, to 
energize Israel's position toward a peaceful formula with Syria 
that is thought to be a central formula for a comprehensive 
settlement in the region. 
  Those officials, however, have immediately noticed that 
there 
are concerted efforts to keep Djerejian away from any important 
activities. In fact, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
almost ignored him completely in his efforts to approximate 
views between the Syrian and Israeli governments. 
  Damascus thinks that the decision of Djerejian -- who had 
faced a personal predicament from which resignation was the only 
way out -- gives further evidence of the efficiency of the 
attack launched by the Jewish lobby in the United States to 
prevent the Clinton administration from playing a balanced role 
in advancing the negotiating process. 
  The Syrian officials are very tense when they view the 
fierce 
method adopted by the Jewish lobby to contain President Clinton, 
as signs of another presidential election campaign have drawn 
near. Some members of the lobby had previously made it public 
that they object to giving Syria an influential role in 
crystallizing the structure of the forthcoming regional order. 
  Those sources think that Dennis Ross, the U.S. negotiation 
coordinator, and Martin Indyk, the official in charge of the 
Middle East in the National Security Council, have managed to 
close in on Djerejian. 
  In fact, Syrian fears go farther than this. Strobe Talbott, 
the deputy secretary of state who is known for his relatively 
balanced view of the Middle East crisis, is being totally 
ignored. Syrian officials have noticed some signs of a trend in 
the U.S. State Department and the National Security Council -- 
without casting doubt on President Clinton and Secretary of 
State Christopher -- to dismantle the diplomatic formula 
launched by the former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker and 
on whose basis the Syrians had accepted to attend the peace 
conference in Madrid in October 1991. 
  The Madrid formula depends on Security Council Resolutions 
242 and 338 which were bypassed when the Gaza-Jericho agreement 
was signed, according to Syria's view of this agreement. 
  Now that Djerejian is absent from the scene, it seems that 
all doors are wide open to Jewish influence in the circles at 
which U.S. policies on the Middle East are drawn up.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] In a commentary today, AL-THAWRAH discusses Yitzhaq 
Rabin's recent statements in which he underlined Israel's 
rejection of full withdrawal from the Golan Heights. The paper 
says: Although what Rabin has said was not anything new, it was, 
however, clear confirmation of Israel's aggressiveness, 
arrogance, lack of interest in peace, and lack of commitment to 
peace and the resolutions of international legitimacy. 
  AL-THAWRAH notes that Israel's aggressions, ugly massacres, 
and violations of international charters in the occupied Arab 
territories and against Lebanon and its steadfast south exceed, 
in quantity and results, all it has done against the Arabs in 
the past four and half decades. 
  The paper says: Israel simply wants peace in exchange for 
peace. It also wants to suppress the Arabs, usurp their rights 
and lands, and confiscate their freedom and free will in the 
name of peace and the logic of violence and occupation. 
  The paper stresses: The kind of peace that we understand and 
seek to achieve must be comprehensive and just, under which 
there will be no signs of aggression and injustice, and under 
which rights and lands are returned in full to their rightful 
Arab owners. Otherwise, there will be no peace. 
  Concluding its editorial, the paper says: Since it sees and 
feels the Israeli threat to peace, the United States, as the 
proponent of the land-for-peace initiative and the peace process 
sponsor, should abandon its role as a spectator and exert 
greater effort. It should stress the credibility of its 
political role to entrench the role of the world community, its 
principles, and laws, and champion, even for one time, the 
causes of right and justice in this region.

  [Text] The soldiers in the war of liberation against the 
British, and their brave young people in Radfan Province have 
sent the following cable to the chairman and members of the 
Presidential Council and the command of the Armed Forces in the 
Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY]: We send you our warmest 
congratulations on the occasion of the declaration of the DRY, 
on behalf of our colleagues Labbuzah, Thabit Husayn al-Uqbi, and 
other strugglers in the war of liberation, and send you a 
suitable gift contained in what follows: 
  A group of fighters in the war of liberation and their brave 
youths attacked the invading enemy forces as they arrived at one 
of the remote villages in Radfan Province. A fierce battle 
ensued, lasting from 1100 on 3 June until the dawn of the 
following day. The following losses were inflicted on the enemy: 
Three military vehicles destroyed, 60 men killed, and a number 
of others wounded. One of our colleagues was martyred, while six 
others were lightly wounded. In response, the enemy proceeded 
to shell villages indiscriminately, martyring a citizen and 
wounding a number of others. We promise our political 
leadership in the DRY that we shall deal with these new 
occupiers just as we dealt with the colonialists, and shall not 
give up an inch of the territory of the DRY. This is a promise 
from strong and loyal strugglers: We shall rout the attacking 
forces, and victory will be our ally, God willing.

  [Text] The popular resistance in the al-Shu'ayb district 
succeeded in resisting an aggressive assault mounted by the 
enemy forces last night and today, and inflicted heavy losses on 
them. This happened when the enemy forces sent a company 
[sariyyah] from the Hamzah Brigade forward, with support from 
all forms of heavy weapons, including Katyushas. They attempted 
to occupy a number of villages in al-Shu'ayb. They carried out 
random shelling against the villages and their peaceful 
inhabitants, which led to the wounding of four citizens. 
  Popular resistance forces engaged the attackers, led by the 
fighters of the liberation war, from last night until this 
afternoon. The enemy suffered heavy losses, as 24 men were 
killed or wounded. Our forces also destroyed three military 
vehicles, along with their crews. An enemy reconnaissance 
officer was captured. The rest of the enemy forces were 
compelled to withdraw and flee in the direction of Qa'tabah.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by "a responsible source at the Defense </F>
Ministry in the Democratic Republic of Yemen"] 
  [Text] Within the framework of challenging the 
international community and all the good Arab international 
efforts, the ruling miltiary regime in Sanaa continues its 
barbarous and aggressive acts against our people in the 
Democratic Republic of Yemen. On this very day, the invading 
and aggressive forces continued their desperate attacks on all 
fronts. Our brave Armed Forces intercepted them, and inflicted 
on them further losses in lives, vehicles, and other military 
equipment. 
  In the Tawr al-Bahah zone, our forces succeeded in mopping 
up 
the infiltrating hostile forces, which were engaged in acts of 
looting, robbery, and rape. Our forces are in the process of 
imposing their control over the situation, after combing a 
number of villages and towns for the routed remnants of the 
hostile forces. On this front the enemy's losses were four 
tanks, two Katyusha launchers, and hundreds of dead and wounded. 
A large number of the enemy's men surrendered, including 
numerous members of the infamous and disreputable jihad elements. 
  Our forces continue, in the provinces of Radfan and al-Dali' 
-- after thousands of people joined them from the province of 
Yafi and other provinces -- to cleanse the villages of the filth 
of the routed remnants of the hostile forces. 
  In the Abyan zone our forces destroyed three Katyusha launch 
vehicles and seized two hostile tanks. The combat actions of 
our forces were characterized by determination, death-defying 
action, a firm defense, and high combat morale. The enemy's 
acts were characterized by barbarousness, randomness, and 
desperation, especially after they realized that the ruling 
military regime in Sanaa insists on continuing to challenge the 
international community, and on shedding the blood of thousands 
of the sons of the central areas, who have no control over their 
fates and are pushed toward the holocaust of war and death. 
  God is great, God is great.

<F P=106> Statement issued by a "responsible source at the Defense </F>
Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Yemen" to the YEMENI NEWS 
AGENCY, Aden] 
  [Text] Within the framework of the flagrant, adventurist 
challenge to the UN Security Council resolution issued on 2 
June, which stipulated an immediate cease-fire, the ruling 
military regime in Sanaa, under the leadership of the 
bloodshedder 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, today continued its 
barbarous, hostile acts against residential quarters, peaceful 
villages, and vital economic installations. Some residential 
quarters in the capital, Aden, were subjected to strikes this 
evening by surface-to-surface missiles. Shrapnel from these 
missiles, which were intercepted by our air defenses, fell on 
some residential quarters and hit innocent citizens. 
  Today, in another arena, crushing battles took place between 
our forces and hostile forces on all fronts. Our forces managed 
to halt the advance of the enemy forces, after inflicting heavy 
human and material losses on them, which we shall report on in 
subsequent communiques. Our forces, led by the fighters of the 
liberation war, continue to cleanse villages and towns of the 
filth of the forces of the al-Ahmar gang which tried to spread 
corruption in those areas, looting the citizens and violating 
their honor. The Armed Forces, supported by the masses of the 
people, are resisting -- with rare courage and legendary bravery 
-- the barbarous and brutal forces, for the 45th consecutive 
day. They have unlimited confidence that the ruling military 
regime in Sanaa will take its last breath in the next few hours, 
and will have to drink from the cup of defeat and disgrace. 
  God is great, God is great, victory is near.

<F P=106> [Report by Muhammad 'Abd-al-Hadi from Aden] </F>
  [Text] Sanaa has denied that foreign parties or Iraqi 
forces are fighting on the side of Sanaa's forces against the 
southern forces. 
  Aden has officially announced the capture of a number of 
Iraqis who fought with the northern forces in battles that raged 
between the southern and northern forces. 
  'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri, vice president of the Democratic 
Republic of Yemen, has this to say: 
  [Begin al-Jifri recording] Brothers from Sudan and Iraq are 
helping the brothers-enemies who are attacking us. There are 
certainly Iraqi pilots. They fly the planes at very high 
altitude so that their planes will not be brought down and be 
captured. The planes used are Iraqi and north Yemeni ones. 
There are so far five Iraqi prisoners and they are in Hadramaut 
and I have just been told that there is one more. They are six 
now. [end recording]

  [Text] The declining media trumpets of the gang of 
rebellion and secession, and some suspect foreign media hostile 
to the Yemeni unity, have continued to propagate exposed lies 
and fabrications to the effect that Iraqis are fighting 
alongside the forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy. 
  On 4 June, the Middle East Broadcasting Corporation, MBC, 
cited its correspondent in Aden on the arrest of some Iraqis 
claiming they were fighters recruited within the ranks of the 
forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy, when in fact they 
are Iraqi teachers who had been teaching in the Hadhramaut 
Governorate. The forces of the gang of rebellion and secession 
arrested them and showed them on television claiming they were 
Iraqi fighters, thus committing a new moral scandal that is 
added to the series of moral scandals committed frequently by 
the gang of rebellion and secession. This gang is experiencing 
its death-throes and is trying, in vain, through these 
fabrications and cheap blackmail, to win foreign sympathy and 
intervention to save it from inevitable doom. 
  The First Channel Television yesterday evening screened 
documentary evidence that refutes the successive fabrications of 
the gang of rebellion, secession, and treason and those of 
suspect and hostile media organs.

official, who asked to remain anonymous, said: The cease-fire 
announcement, which will be issued by the Presidential Council 
in Yemen, will come in harmony with the Sanaa government's 
acceptance of the Security Council resolution, calling for a 
cease-fire. The northern Yemeni official added: Yemeni 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih is currently holding contacts 
with the Defense Ministry and the command of the Army units to

sold itself to the devil, our people will defend unity being the 
great strategic objective. Our people struggled and offered 
dear sacrifices to achieve this historic national objective and 
pan-Arab gain.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah by </F>
'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Mu'ayyad, in Sanaa; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Al-Mu'ayyad] Do you expect 
that 'Ali Salim al-Bid to succeed in his plan for the state he 
has declared? 
  [Basindwah] Of course not, for several reasons. The most 
important of these reasons are: First, the nations of the 
world, both fraternal and friendly states, consider what is 
going on an internal Yemeni affair. These states find 
themselves obliged to support Yemen's unity, especially since 
unity embodies the Yemeni people's will and choice. The best 
proof of this is the U.S. Administration's stand. Second, 
al-Bid cannot take valiant Aden as the capital of his 
secessionist state. How can he impose this state which he has 
dreamed up when he does not have any control over the capital 
Aden? Third, the escape of al-Bid and his closest entourage to 
Hadhramaut does not at all mean that he can impose his powers on 
the Hadhramaut Governorate because its citizens have suffered a 
great deal from them. Undoubtedly, the forces of legitimacy 
will pursue them to the farthest point in the homeland. Fourth, 
most of the forces of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] have 
either joined the forces of legitimacy, or have been completely 
destroyed. Regardless of the attempts of al-Bid and his group to 
establish new forces, they will never be able to stand fast in 
front of the forces of legitimacy, which are supported by the 
people. Fifth, al-Bid has now destroyed his credibility on the 
popular level both inside and outside the country. The battle 
now is not between al-Bid and President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. 
Neither is it between the YSP and the General People's 
Congress, but between him [al-Bid] and his group on the one 
hand, and the people on the other, including large sectors of 
the YSP itself. So, how can he win the battle? [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Mu'ayyad] What do you expect 'Ali Salim al-Bid to do 
with 
his plan for the state he has declared after he has lost most of 
his military forces, along with the battles in the three 
governorates surrounding Aden? 
  [Basindwah] I believe that from the very beginning, his plan 
was aimed at establishing a state in Hadhramaut and al-Mahrah. 
I sensed this long ago. In fact, I used to accuse him of this. 
One day, he attacked me for accusing him of this. Now, time 
has confirmed my intuition and expectations. However, this 
dream will never come true. This is because the citizens in 
Hadhramaut and al- Mahrah themselves do not support him, but 
rather, they are in favor of unity. 
  [Al-Mu'ayyad] On what basis did you judge al-Bid as not 
being 
a unionist from the very beginning? 
  [Basindwah] I had the feeling that al-Bid joined the unity 
against his will, and that he has always thought of separation, 
even after he agreed on unity. He wanted to wait, however, 
until after he found a way out of the impasse the former South 
Yemen found itself in as a result of the lack of world support 
after the changes Gorbachev introduced in the former USSR's 
policy, and the collapse of the communist regimes. Al-Bid was 
also trying to contain the possibilities of confrontation with 
his opponents inside the country and in the region's states to 
which the leadership of the ruling party in Aden had been 
hostile with for two decades. 
  The actions of al-Bid and his group since the establishment 
of unity have showed that they are neither concerned about unity 
nor do they have faith in it. It is true that they used to brag 
about unity, but their actions were secessionist. This applies 
to the democracy whose rules and results they continued to 
reject. Had al-Bid been faithful to unity, he would have 
settled the crisis when he obtained concessions beyond his 
expectations. However, although he was a vice president, he 
continued to act as if he was another president of the state.

  [Text] Presidential Council member 'Abd-al-'Aziz 
'Abd-al-Ghani, who is currently in New York, has rejected the 
separatist and apostate gang's announcement of a so-called new 
government in Aden, describing it as illegitimate and 
unrecognized. He also described it as a violation and 
circumvention of the UN Security Council. 
  In a telephone conversation held with him from Doha by the 
Qatari News Agency editor-in-chief, the Presidential Council 
member stressed that all the Yemeni people support unity and do 
not approve of what is being done by the secessionist elements 
in Aden. He said the separatists obstructed all positive 
initiatives designed to overcome our country's current crisis. 
He explained: When we announced a cease-fire on the eve of 
the blessed 'Id al-Adha, they issued the declaration of 
secession. Now, when a UN Security Council resolution has been 
issued calling for peace and stability in our country, they 
declare the formation of a secessionist government. 
  The Presidential Council member reiterated that our country 
welcomes the UN Security Council resolution and deals with it on 
condition that all those concerned cooperate with the 
implementation of the resolution. He said the resolution 
proceeds from the principles and the charter of the United 
Nations, for it calls for respecting the unity and sovereignty 
of the entire territory of the Republic of Yemen. He explained 
that our country's approval of the UN Security Council 
resolution is not considered a change in its policy. He 
explained: We welcomed the resolution after we found that it 
does not contravene the Republic of Yemen's unity and 
sovereignty over its entire territory. Consequently, the 
resolution has been dealt with. He stressed that as a UN 
member, our country could not have prevented the UN Security 
Council from debating any issue. He explained that the UN 
Security Council will be submitted to the Presidential Council, 
given that the executive authority in the Republic of Yemen is 
made up of the Presidential Council and the Council of Ministers. 
  The Presidential Council member welcomed the appointment of 
Lakhdar Ibrahim as a representative of the UN secretary general 
to lead the fact-finding committee. He described Ibrahimi as an 
esteemed Arab personality worthy of this mission.

  [Text] Kuwait City, June 4 (AFP) -- Yemen's civil war will 
drag on for 100 years if the international community recognises 
the breakaway southern state, a northern Yemeni diplomat warned 
Saturday [4 June]. 
  Ghalib 'Ali Jamil, Yemen's ambassador to Saudi Arabia, told 
the Kuwaiti daily Al-Siyasah: "If the Arabs and the world want 
Yemenis to continue slaughtering each other for 100 years, they 
only have to recognise the secession" of the self-declared Yemen 
Democratic Republic. 
  "We will then be two countries and for decades we will 
devote 
ourselves to war, instead of development," he said, adding both 
sides would use oil revenues to buy arms. 
  Civil war broke out on May 5, four years after conservative 
North Yemen was unified with the Marxist South. 
  Southern leaders declared the independent republic on May 
21, 
but it has yet to be officially recognised by any country. 
  Jamil also criticised the adoption of a UN Security Council 
resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire. 
  "Yemen's affairs, which are strictly local, should not have 
been brought before the Security Council," he said.

  [Text] The shaykhs, notables, and sons of the Ba Kazm tribe 
in the Districts of al-Mahfid and Ahwar in the Abyan Governorate 
have issued a statement denying the reports issued by the 
secessionist remnants over their media organs regarding alleged 
and baseless support by their tribe. The statement said that 
the shaykhs and notables of the Ba Kazm tribe, who played an 
honorable role in resisting colonial rule and evil powers over 
the past 25-year rule of the secessionist gang, declare their 
adherence to unity and constitutional legitimacy. This 
reflects, the statement added, the principled positions they 
have announced in early 1991, when they met with brother 
President Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. During that 
meeting, the statement noted, they pledged to support and defend 
unity. 
  The statement added that the treasonous, agent, and 
secessionist gang within the Yemeni Socialist Party and its 
allied hirelings, feeling that they are now in their death 
throes, are fabricating alleged and baseless cables of 
congratulations to deceive the public opinion through cheap 
tactics. They have used the name of the Ba Kazm tribe, given 
its profound influence and role, in an attempt to influence the 
positions of other tribes, forgetting that unity and Yemen are 
dearer and more chaste than all filthy money. 
  The Ba Kazm notables concluded their statement by extending 
their greetings, appreciation, and absolute allegiance to the 
symbol struggler Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, and expressing 
support for constitutional legitimacy, the leadership, and the 
governorate represented by Abyan Governor struggler 'Ali Shaykh 
'Umar, and the forces vindicating legitimacy and unity. 
  God is great. Victory and pride to unity, constitutional 
legitimacy, and Yemen.

<F P=106> [Message from Arab League Secretary General 'Abd-al-Majid to </F>
the speaker of the House of Representatives] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
  His Excellency brother 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, 
speaker 
of the House of Representatives, Republic of Yemen. 
  Greetings; 
  I received with appreciation and concern the Yemeni House of 
Representatives' message on 30 May 1994, conveyed to us by 
Ambassador Ahmad Muhammad Luqman, permanent representative of 
the Republic of Yemen to the Arab League. 
  I would like to stress to your excellency that the 
developments in the Republic of Yemen have always been the 
concern of the Arab League because the strength and stability of 
Yemen, as well as the safety of its people, are a support for 
the Arab nation and joint Arab action. 
  Proceeding from this, I dispatched a mission to the Republic 
of Yemen on 4 March 1994. Furthermore, the 101st session of the 
Arab League Council issued a statement on 26 March 1994, 
affirming its deep concern over the developments in Yemen and 
urging the Yemeni political leaders to double their efforts to 
resolve differences in a way that strengthens unity and spreads 
stability in Yemen and security in the whole region. Also, the 
Arab League Council adopted in its extraordinary session 
Resolution No. 5,409 on 7 May 1994, a copy of which is attached 
to this letter. In this resolution, the Arab League Council 
called for an immediate cease-fire and ending the deterioration 
in Yemen to safeguard its unity. 
  Within this framework, their majesties and excellencies the 
Arab kings and presidents, as well as Arab national 
organizations and personalities, continued their efforts to stop 
Arab bloodshed in sisterly Yemen and to preserve its resources 
and achievements. I also sent a high-level delegation to Sanaa 
where it met with His Excellency President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
and a number of ranking Yemeni figures. 
  I am still exerting efforts and holding contacts in 
accordance with the abovementioned Arab League Council 
resolution, using all the potentials of the Arab League 
Secretariat to achieve this noble objective. 
  I appeal to you -- in light of what is dictated on you by 
your responsibility -- to exert efforts and do what is 
appropriate and effective to implement the resolution of Arab 
legitimacy. 
  I ask God to grant us all success for the wellbeing and 
safety of the sisterly Yemeni Arab people. God knows our 
intention, and He leads us to the right path. 
  God's peace, mercy, and blessings be upon you. 
  [Signed] Secretary General Dr. Ahmad 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Appeal of Reason Should Be Heeded"] </F>
  [Text] The resolution adopted by the UN Security Council 
[UNSC] does not concern Yemen's unity or partition. It is aimed 
at silencing the guns and stopping the massacres. 
  As was expected, the UNSC resolution calling for an 
immediate 
cease-fire in the Yemeni war has provoked initial hostile 
reactions from the two parties to the conflict. 
  But one point is now certain, namely that neither of the two 
parties to the conflict will be able to ignore a resolution 
embodying the international community's will. The world as a 
whole is demanding an immediate end to the fratricide in Yemen. 
And the international community is willing and has the ability 
to guarantee the two parties' respect for its will. 
  Obviously there are people outside Yemen who would like to 
prove their courage at the expense of Yemeni blood. One of them 
says that "Yemeni unity must be safeguarded, even if it costs 
100,000 Yemeni lives." Another is urging Yemeni leaders to defy 
the will of the world "and to continue the fighting to the last 
drop of their blood." 
  But the reality is that most Yemenis -- in the north or the 
south -- refuse to allow the Yemeni land to be turned into a 
graveyard to satisfy demagogic ideas abroad. And most likely, 
they do not want a unity based on mass murder, especially as 
they can see that the one-month war has not settled any of the 
political problems that ignited the war in the first place. 
  There is positive evidence that many leading elements in the 
north and the south have begun to understand the general mood. 
These elements now believe that this war lacks the popular 
support for its continuation until it is settled in favor of 
this or that party. 
  The resolution adopted by the UNSC is precise and fair in 
its 
wording and contains a number of reasonable demands. 
  It is not adopting a position on the essence of the dispute 
between the north and the south. By citing the Republic of 
Yemen twice, the resolution has refuted the argument of those 
quarters who accused the UNSC of trying to impose the partition 
option on Yemen. It is clear that the resolution does not 
concern Yemen's unity or its partition. It is aimed at 
silencing the guns and providing a breather for reflection in 
order to resume the political dialogue, instead of war, until a 
just and lasting settlement to the dispute is achieved. 
  It is necessary for us to point here to a historic fact, 
namely that this is not the first time the United Nations has 
intervened to end a civil war. In the last decade the 
international organization took a number of measures to end 
civil wars in at least 19 states. 
  So is there any reason to exclude Yemen from this rule? And 
is it permissible for the world to stand with its hands tied 
while the killing and destruction continue in Yemen, merely to 
satisfy those who think that war alone will achieve their 
objectives? 
  The council is also urging the imposition of a ban on arms 
supplies to the two parties. Actually the council is saying 
"no" to pouring fuel on a blazing fire. So what is wrong with 
the position adopted by the international community? There is 
nothing wrong. It is a rational and wise position. How nice it 
would be if the two parties heeded it. 
  The two parties to this tragic war must accept the sincere 
UN 
appeal. They must heed the appeal of reason emanating from the 
UNSC Council. If they ignore this appeal, they will be ignoring 
not only the international community's will, but the will of the 
Yemeni people, who certainly want to live in security, peace, 
and stability, not in a civil war.

<F P=106> ["Text" of appeal by visual and audio media to Aden District </F>
people "warning that the gang of crime and treason has 
distributed booby-trapped pens, toys, and watches to blow them 
up"] 
  In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. The 
one who betrays his country cannot appreciate others because he 
lacks all feelings of citizenship in both heart and mind. 
Likewise, the one who plots to fragment his country will not 
hesitate to send all the sons of the country to the crematorium 
of death and annihilation. Every criminal who commits such 
crimes will not hesitate to perpetrate the ugliest of crimes 
toward others, be they men, women, youths, elderly, or children. 
Thus, the mania of crime and grudge led traitor agent 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid, the initiator of war and killer of children and 
women, to cherish the idea of killing children with trickery and 
cheap games in a bid to distort the citizens' feelings toward 
the future of the homeland. As for their present, unity has 
triumphed to the point of no return. The immortal existence of 
unity has been baptized for ever by the sacrifices of the brave 
heroes of the Armed and Security Forces. Otherwise, what is the 
meaning of criminal al-Bid's distribution of booby-trapped pens, 
toys, and watches in Aden streets and suburbs so that children 
can pick them up and get blown up under the claim that the one 
who distributed them and dropped them from planes are the forces 
of unity and legitimacy? They will then portray those 
victimized children to the world public as victims of the 
missiles which they falsely claim the forces of unity and 
protection of legitimacy are using to shell the city suburbs. 
It is easy to tell such lies and make such fabrications before 
us and the world. They are cheap lies about an ugly crime of 
killing children in such a vile and cowardly manner. 
  While revealing this bitter fact about the latest innovation 
of the criminal secessionists, we appeal to fathers and mothers 
and all citizens in the suburbs of the city of Aden--in 
(Kiraytar), al-Mu'alla, al-Tawwahi, (Hawr Makthar), al-Shaykh 
'Uthman, al-Qallu'ah, al-Burayqah, al-Mansurah, al-Sha'b city, 
and other suburbs--to prevent children from picking up any pens, 
watches, toys, or housewares from the streets in front of their 
houses so that their lives will be saved and no distortions be 
sustained. 
  As for the criminal secessionist butchers, they will sooner 
or later receive their punishment. Our people will never be 
deceived by all their criminal methods and vile, treacherous 
actions. Tomorrow is close at hand for all to see.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the "Presidential Council of the </F>
Democratic Republic of Yemen" in Aden on 3 June] 
  [Text] There have been repeated statements from 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih's regime, some from its Council of Ministers and 
some from its foreign minister, that they are committed to the 
UN Security Council's resolution. Not satisfied with lying to 
our people, they are using the same approach with the regional 
and international organizations. Their forces continue to wage 
their barbaric and immoral aggression in all the battle zones 
which shows that people like this neither respect themselves nor 
the world. Their word cannot be trusted. 
  We once again ask the international community, with its 
different bodies and organizations, as well as the fraternal and 
friendly countries, to work with us to compel that regime to 
adhere to legitimacy and the basis of reality, or else to admit 
that it has no control. Consequently, they should leave the 
governing of the north to those who can establish self-respect 
and respect for the international community. 
  We shall courageously resist this aggression supported by 
all 
the sons of our people. We expect a decisive stand from the 
international community to put an end to the arrogance, vanity, 
and aggression directed against us from more than one state. 
Iraq's involvement has been confirmed, as well as others in 
this aggression, in a desperate attempt to occupy our territory 
and destroy our people's vital interests and violate what we 
hold sacred. 
  We call on the international community to witness that any 
continuation of this aggression against our people and our 
territory and our vital interests will compel us to destroy the 
vital interests in the north even though we have been careful to 
avoid that, because such interests are owned by the people of 
Yemen jointly with friends, and we are concerned to protect 
their interests and maintain our good relations with them. But 
the Sanaa regime is exploiting this concern of ours and every 
day attacks our vital interests with its missiles and aircraft.

  [Text] Al-Shariqah, 5 Jun (MENA)--Dr. 'Ali Salim al-Bid 
has called on the Arabs to extend their hands to the Yemeni 
people and work on putting out the fire raging in Yemen. Al-Bid 
asked the Gulf Cooperation Council countries to take a decisive 
stand. He declared that the people in the south are expecting 
their state to be recognized. 
  In an interview with AL-KHALIJ newspaper today in the city 
of 
al-Mukalla, where he is currently residing, he said: I was 
expecting a decisive stand to be taken. The issue now is the 
security of the Gulf region, the stability of the people, and 
the interests of these two countries. Al-Bid affirmed that an 
effective cease-fire must be the priority. He said that 
continued fighting, which will go on for a long time, will not 
stop when Yemen is split in two. He also confirmed that he is 
ready to take up the issue of unity once again, build new 
institutions, and take new action, with wisdom and sanity this 
time round. Al-Bid said that unity is our right. It is not the 
unity of the House of al-Ahmar, but the unity of Yemen and the 
Yemeni people. We will continue our peaceful and democratic 
struggle for this cause. 
  Al-Bid revealed that he has information regarding the 
delivery of eight Iraqi aircraft the day before yesterday to 
Sanaa via Tashkent. He believes the mediators are Iranian. He 
said that there might be Iraqi support for Sanaa through Iran. 
As for reports about Jordanian aid to Sanaa, al-Bid said: We 
have information that Jordanian planes are flying to Sanaa 
carrying ammunition and weapons. On the returns from the oil 
resources in the south, al-Bid said that Exxon has frozen the 
profits from sales and deposited them in a bank for both sides. 
Production, however, continues and is increasing. It has now 
reached over 150,000 barrels per day. Production in Hadhramaut 
has reached 130,000 barrels per day. On the reasons for his 
transfer from Aden to Hadhramaut, al-Bid said: I have come to 
al-Mukalla for organizational purposes. The region has oil and 
the people must know that someone is protecting it.

  [Text] 'Ali Salim al-Bid, Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] 
secretary general, said that it was Sanaa that started the war 
in Yemen and that the war was forcibly imposed on the south. 
  In an interview he gave to AL-QABAS newspaper reporter 
'Abd-al-Salam al-'Awadi in Mukalla, which was published today, 
Al-Bid said that the southerners entered the union willingly 
with sound convictions and dealt with it in the same sound 
spirit and with democratic means. 
  'Ali Salim al-Bid said that integration did not take place 
between the two parts of Yemen due to the existence of two types 
of upbringing, two types of thought, two types of mentality and 
two different methods. He said that the southerners wanted 
democratic pluralism in a way that conformed with the spirit of 
the age in the shadow of security, stability, and unity. 
  The YSP secretary general affirmed that southerners were 
treated as third- or fourth-class citizens in the union. He 
said that we have discovered from the way Sanaa treated us that 
we were two peoples, not one. 
  'Ali Salim al-Bid stressed that the war that was taking 
place 
in Yemen affected the security and stability of the Gulf region 
and the interests of its peoples. He called on the Arab 
countries to work in the Yemeni people's interests, emphasizing 
that the continuation of the civil war in Yemen was not in the 
interests of the region as a whole. 
  'Ali Salim al-Bid said the announcement of the cessation of 
the south from the north has come for the benefit of Yemen, to 
prevent it from being divided into mini-states if the war, in 
which there would be no victor or vanquished, continues.

<F P=106> [Interview with 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri, "vice president of </F>
the Democratic Republic of Yemen," by Zaki Shihab; place and 
date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Shihab] How can you tip the 
military balance in your favor after all the achievements made 
by the northern troops on various fronts? 
  [Al-Jifri] Following the creation of a political balance, 
and 
after the declaration of the DRY [Democratic Republic of Yemen], 
the people's morale was lifted. Before this, they used to think 
the regime would continue as it is. However, when the people 
realized that this regime is for all citizens and that it is 
defending a just cause, and that President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
intended to move the battle into their territory, their morale 
was lifted, and many of the DRY citizens began to go to the 
battlefield. Many of them are now receiving good training and 
we will send them to the battlefield in groups. We did not wish 
for this, because we are against fighting. However, when we are 
forced, we should confront them and our stands must be strong 
and clear. We are advocates of unity, but they have forced us 
to establish the DRY as a result of their arrogance and 
crudeness. I am sure that the sons of the DRY can check this 
arrogance. 
  [Shihab] You have spoken about measures that are being taken 
to reinforce your steadfastness. What are the precautionary 
measures taken to prevent the northern troops' advance toward 
Aden? 
  [Al-Jifri] The pillars of steadfastness have always been the 
same throughout history; the will, men, and capabilities. We 
have all this. We have the will to defend what is right, which 
gives us greater strength than the other side, even though the 
majority is with the other party. 
  [Shihab] When you say that you will not go back to unity 
until a regime which understands unity takes over, do you mean 
that there will be no dialogue with the regime in Sanaa? 
  [Al-Jifri] There is only room for talks with the current 
regime in Sanaa on one point; namely, on a cease-fire and on the 
withdrawal of its forces to where they came from. However, if 
wise people come from Sanaa to stop this madness, our hearts and 
minds will be open to them. 
  [Shihab] Do you believe that it is possible to topple the 
regime in Sanaa at the current stage? 
  [Al-Jifri] I am sure of this, because our people in the 
neighboring republic have faith in unity and in modernization. 
They have suffered from injustice, and have realized that 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih's actions have led to secession, destruction, 
and fighting. I do not think that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih will 
remain in power after this. 
  [Shihab] Who was convinced of secession from among the 
[Yemeni] Socialist Party [YSP] members? 
  [Al-Jifri] Brother President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, who enjoys 
sound experience and clear vision. Other members have continued 
to look for other alternatives. [passage omitted] 
  [Shihab] Are you confident that you will be able to restore 
the southern areas that have been occupied? 
  [Al-Jifri] One hundred percent. We will restore them either 
peacefully or by force.

    [Text] Our correspondent in Aden reported a short time ago 
that fire is illuminating Aden's sky because of missiles being 
fired by the southern forces to down northern forces' missiles. 
  The corredspondent affirmed that the vice president of the 
proclaimed Presidential Council in Aden, 'Abd-al-Rahman 
al-Jifri, contacted him a short while ago asking that an appeal 
be addressed through the MBC to the international community to 
halt the war. This comes after the northerners pounded the city 
of al-Waht 60 km from Aden. 
  Al-Jifri said the attack on al-Waht killed and wounded many 
of its residents and displaced those who survived. He appealed 
to humanitarian organizations to supply Aden with doctors and 
medical aid.

  [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 4 (AFP) -- Southern Yemeni forces 
may ask Saudi Arabia to send troops to help fight rival northern 
forces, the appointed vice president of the breakaway southern 
state told AFP Saturday [4 June]. 
  'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri said southern leaders had "not yet 
decided" whether to ask for Saudi intervention in the month-long 
war, but added "everything is possible and legitimate to protect 
our people". 
  He spoke as northern troops loyal to President 'Ali 
'Abdallah 
Salih edged closer to the south's bastion of Aden, capital of 
the self-declared Yemen Democratic Republic. 
  Al-Jifri was commenting on reports of reinforcements to the 
Saudi military presence on its border with the former South 
Yemen, which united with North Yemen four years ago. 
  He said the reinforcements were not a Saudi intervention but 
"a precaution that any state would take in the event of war in 
its neighbouring state." 
  Al-Jifri said: "I am sure that Saudi Arabia would not 
intervene unless it was asked to by somebody," adding such a 
request would be "internationally legitimate." 
  Southern forces loyal to the president's rival 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid, who declared the breakaway republic on May 21, have 
accepted UN Security Council Resolution 924 calling for an 
immediate ceasefire in the civil war. 
  Northern forces, now within 15 kilometers (nine miles) of 
Aden, have also said they are prepared to accept the UN 
resolution. 
  Saudi Arabia, which initiated the UN resolution along with 
other Gulf states, has denied northern charges that it is siding 
with the south in the war. 
  Saudi's King Fahd has urged north and south Yemen to 
implement the UN Security Council's call for a ceasefire. 
  "If the north and the south accept UN Security Council 
Resolution 924, it will be a good initiative and one that should 
lead to a definitive halt to the fighting," he said in an 
interview broadcast late Friday on the London-based Arabic 
television station MBC.

  [Text] The vice chairman of the Presidential Council, 
Brother 'Abd-al-Rahman 'Ali al-Jifri, said that what had been 
reported in the media as a statement by him to the French news 
agency, AFP -- that the Democratic Republic of Yemen would ask 
for military assistance from the brotherly Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia -- had never happened. 
  In a statement to the Yemeni NEWS AGENCY, Aden, al-Jifri 
said 
that the Democratic Republic of Yemen had made no decision to 
ask for military intervention from any side. He stated that 
what had happened was that he had replied to a question by AFP 
on whether the Democratic Republic of Yemen would seek military 
assistance from any quarter by saying that such a decision had 
not yet been made, but that anything was possible, and that if 
we decided to demand anything, we would ask the United Nations 
to act on Resolution No. 924. 
  The vice chairman added that there was no mention in his 
reply concerning any country which held our trust and pride, 
such as our brothers in the Gulf Cooperation Council -- the 
Republic of Egypt, Syria, and the rest of Arab countries. 
  The vice chairman said that when questioned on this matter, 
the AFP correspondent denied that he had filed this statement, 
or that his agency had published this version of the story.

<F P=106> [Speech by 'Abd-al-Rahman 'Ali al-Jifri, "vice chairman of </F>
the Democratic Republic of Yemen Presidential Council"; place 
and date not given] 
  [Text] Dear brother citizens, I am honored to speak to 
you, in order to inform you as to what is happening in the 
country. On the political level, President 'Ali Salim al-Bid 
has played an extraordinary role, politically and militarily, in 
the mobilization in Hadramawt and Shabwah. Regarding 
international contacts, Brother Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas left 
yesterday evening, accompanied by Muhsin Muhammad Abu-Bakr Bin 
Farid, the deputy prime minister and minister of planning and 
development; and brother Salih 'Ubayd Ahmad, the deputy prime 
minister and minister of transportion; for a number of Arab 
countries, beginning with Saudi Arabia, where they are now. 
Brother 'Abdallah al-Asnaj will go to a few countries and then 
to New York, to work together with Dr. 'Abd-al-Aziz al-Dali, to 
build the pillars of the fledgling Democratic Republic of Yemen. 
  At the military level we are, unfortunately, fighting a 
brutal enemy; we say a brutal enemy knowing that the people in 
the north are brothers of ours in Arabism, Islam, and in the 
homeland, but the officials of Sanaa are waging this unjustified 
attack in the name of a unity which could, in any way, be on the 
skulls of the people and through [words indistinct]. They 
issued orders to destroy all villages in their way. Our people, 
the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, and the 
volunteers, led by the hero Brother Haytham Qasim Tahir, and all 
commanders of axes and commanders of all the armies, 
particularly the air force, are resisting. [passage omitted] 
  We did not initiate secession, it was Sanaa's rulers who 
started the separation when they rejected all the initiatives 
calling for a cease-fire. [passage indistinct] 
  We are the advocates of unity, and we will, God willing, 
build our Republic as a real model of justice and equality. We 
will unite with any ruler from Sanaa, provided he sets up the 
same regime on the same bases and principles. We will give our 
lives and blood so that our people are not subjected to 
despotism, injustice, and corruption. 
  One more point: We would like to send a message to our 
brothers in the Democratic Republic of Yemen, some of whom have 
joined us, and some who are still siding with the other party 
for either few dirhams, or because of old old scores. [passage 
indistinct] We said why do we not [word indistinct] a historic 
reconciliation between the people of the Democratic Republic of 
Yemen. [passage indistinct] We warned many times against 
ignoring the UN Security Council's resolution, but our brothers, 
the rulers of Sanaa, refuse to observe the UN Security Council's 
resolutions, or any call from any quarter, whether Arab or [word 
indistinct]. 
  We call on those fraternal and brotherly countries to use 
their pressure and influence on those who could not get rid of 
their complexes, and who failed to comprehend the meaning of 
contemporary times, defying international legitimacy -- as if 
past lessons taught to other countries were not enough. 
  We will fight to the last inch for our country, we will not 
allow the occupation of our country, and we will resist them 
with all the force we have. We realize that our people are 
standing behind us, and that they will fight beside us, whatever 
the price. [passage omitted] 
  I would like to make an important point: We in this state -- 
president, government, and people, will resist [passage 
indistinct]. We do not want to kill, or fight, but we have the 
right to defend every inch of our land. On this occasion, I 
call on the youngsters in [words indistinct] to unite with us. 
Popular resistance groups have begun being formed, and they 
will be very well organized; they will go to the fronts and we 
will repulse the enemy from Aden, Lahij, Abyan, and Shabwah. 
  Dear citizens, be sure that we would not have taken this 
stance if we were not fully confident of Brother President 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid, and if we we were not sure that 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih -- we wish he could see reason -- has lost the way and 
waged this barbaric war, which we will not allow to continue.

  [Text] The vice president of the Presidential Council, 
brother 'Abd-al-Rahman 'Ali al-Jifri, made a telephone call this 
evening to brother Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN secretary general's 
envoy to Yemen. He explained to him the developments of the 
situation and the persistence of Sanaa's regime to reject 
commitment to international legitimacy, its indiscriminate 
shelling of peaceful citizens and the Aden oil refinery, and its 
barbaric acts against civilians which proved (?beyond a doubt) 
that Sanaa's regime did not seek unity, as it claimed, but 
sought occupation and control of the land of the Democratic 
Republic of Yemen after destroying its villages, towns, and 
vital installations. 
  In his conversation with Brahimi, brother al-Jifri urged 
the United Nations to shoulder its responsibility and pressure 
the aggressor to comply with the international legitimacy. 
  He made clear that our Army and people will continue 
defending their destiny, land, and honor [words indistinct] 
regardless of the might of the aggressor. 
  On his part, brother Brahimi, the figure internationally 
well- known for his struggle, affirmed that he would made 
contacts and efforts to put an end to this unjust aggression and 
to implement the UN Security Council Resolution No. 924. He 
expressed eagerness for Yemen's sons and their destiny. 
  Meanwhile, brother 'Abd-al-Rahman 'al-Jifri, vice president 
of the Presidential Council, affirmed to Yemeni and the Arab 
people [words indistinct] that we would struggle and resist 
[words indistinct] till we achieve [words indistinct].

  [Excerpt] Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, who has been 
tasked with forming a government in the [southern] Democratic 
Republic of Yemen [DRY], has stated that all the members of the 
Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] Political Bureau, including those 
outside Yemen, were consulted before the decision to proclaim 
the establishment of the DRY was made. 
  In an interview with AL-WASAT in London, al-'Attas said that 
while he was in the United States for medical treatment, he held 
consultations with many of his colleagues in the Political 
Bureau, including Salim Salih Muhammad, YSP assistant secretary 
general and Presidential Council member, whose name was not on 
the list of 16 members against whom arrest warrants were issued. 
  Al-'Attas, whom 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih dismissed as prime 
minister when the situation deteriorated, said that the decision 
to go back to the pre-unity state of affairs was dictated by the 
facts on the ground. He said: War has dealt unity a blow and 
secession is a way to extricate Yemen from its dilemma. The 
return to the political formula that preceded unity is a 
preventive measure to save Yemen from fragmentation. Secession 
represents part of our efforts to introduce Yemen into the 20th 
century. Perhaps it is an advanced step to save the elite, 
which calls for the establishment of a state of institutions and 
law, to enhance the concept of political pluralism, and help 
modernize the state. 
  By affirming that he consulted all YSP Political Bureau 
members before the announcement of the secession, al-'Attas 
seems to be closing the door, if temporarily, in the face of 
Sanaa's attempts to sow a rift within the YSP by inviting 
northern leaders within the YSP -- like Dr. Yasin Sa'id Nu'man, 
Jarallah 'Umar, Yahya al-Shami, and Ahmad al-Salami, who all are 
YSP Political Bureau members -- to hold a dialogue. Al-'Attas 
said: All such reports are mere rumors that show just how much 
the General People's Congress and the Yemeni Reform Grouping 
wish to divide the YSP. This has been their major concern since 
the proclamation of unity. In the early months of unity, they 
disseminated reports about the existence of the intransigent 
Fattah line within the YSP, which later proved to be all rumors 
that northern intelligence organizations propagated. He said 
that reports that Jarallah 'Umar has left Aden for the north is 
not true, as Jarallah 'Umar has been nominated to assume one of 
the ministerial portfolios in the new DRY government. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with "South Yemeni Prime Minister" Haydar </F>
Abu-Bakr al-'Attas by MBC correspondent Tawfiq Jazulit, in Aden; 
monitored in progress -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Jazulit] I have just come here from Sanaa. One can 
feel that the Yemeni public in Sanaa, and perhaps outside Sanaa 
too, support the president of the Yemen Arab Republic in his 
efforts to maintain unity by any possible means, because unity 
is a popular demand. Therefore, there is a rift between the 
Yemenis in connection with this issue. What do you want to tell 
the Yemenis in Sanaa and the northern governorates who consider 
you separatists? You did secede. What do you want to tell the 
people, the ordinary citizens, who maintain that you seceded 
from the unified state? 
  [Al-'Attas] Regrettably, we in Yemen, just like the rest of 
the Arab homeland, handled the unity issue emotionally. Facts 
and reason had no influence on the formulation of the unity 
policies we pursued nor on the manner in which we implemented 
them. 
  [Jazulit] You therefore bear responsibility for the failure 
of unity... 
  [Al-'Attas, interrupting] Certainly everyone is to blame. 
The leaders bear the blame, certainly. When we the southern 
leaders united with the northern leaders to establish the Yemeni 
union, the public responded favorably to this great national 
dream. As a consequence, the Republic of Yemen was proclaimed. 
However, when the people realized that things were being done 
that were different from those they had expected under the aegis 
of unity, they began to declare their rejection of these acts 
and this form of unity. Perhaps the masses of the people in the 
southern and eastern governorates, currently the Democratic 
Republic of Yemen, made their feelings known during the 
parliamentary elections of 27 April 1993. They declined to give 
a single vote to the representatives of the government in the 
northern governorates. They gave their entire vote and all the 
parliamentary seats in their governorates to the representatives 
of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] which formerly represented 
the leaders of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. The 
masses of the people in Sanaa, and indeed all Yemeni people, 
support the unity. However... 
  [Jazulit, interrupting] The masses of the people in Sanaa 
regard you as separatists. 
  [Al-'Attas] I do not believe that is true. The people in 
Sanaa know who the separatist really is. Perhaps the 
southernmost governorates of northern Yemen, that is the Yemen 
Arab Republic, are suffering more than the southern governorates 
ever suffered. We embarked on a union with the understanding 
that it would be an equal union between partners formed by the 
People's Democratic Republic of Yemen and the Yemen Arab 
Republic, which would then integrate the institutions of both 
parts of the country. However, the brothers [in the north] 
looked on the union as an annexation. Some Sanaa leaders said 
that the part had returned to the whole. We found this 
reasoning unacceptable. We first expressed our rejection of 
this reasoning during meetings held in September 1990 between 
the YSP Political Bureau and the General People's Congress' 
General Committee. 
  [Jazulit] Let us again discuss the government that you head. 
It is a government without a parliament. Will this government 
be an interim government serving merely to explore the reactions 
of the Yemeni public here? What does the public expect from you? 
  [Al-'Attas] First of all, we have formed an interim 
parliament and called it the National Assembly. 
  [Jazulit] Does this parliament actually have a 
constitutional 
character? 
  [Al-'Attas] Yes, under the circumstances. This parliament is 
composed first of the representatives of the electoral 
constituencies who were elected in the southern and eastern 
governorates and who formerly made efforts to strengthen Yemeni 
unity. Representatives of the political forces in the 
Democratic Republic of Yemen were also included in this 
parliament. We believe that this National Assembly, which is an 
interim one, is sufficiently constitutional to monitor and 
supervise affairs of government legally. 
  [Jazulit] Where do you place public opinion here, in south 
Yemen, on your list of priorities, that is, on the list of the 
priorities of the government you will chair? You must take what 
the Yemeni public wants into account. The YSP must certainly 
have made errors for which the Yemenis have paid a price. Now 
you have formed a new state and you have a government and an 
interim parliament, as you mentioned. Could you tell me what 
the masses expect from you? 
  [Al-'Attas] I believe you were here in Aden when the 
Democratic Republic of Yemen was proclaimed, or indeed, 
reestablished. This republic has maintained all its 
institutions despite the union years as a result of the conduct 
of the Sanaa leaders. You have noticed how the masses of the 
people were very joyful at this proclamation, here in Aden and 
in all the other governorates. Regrettably, our people here in 
the southern governorates see themselves as entering a new stage 
of independence. Independent of whom? Of our brothers in Sanaa. 
  [Jazulit] This is a very dangerous sentiment. 
  [Al-'Attas] Of course, this is a very dangerous sentiment 
and 
we frequently warned that it might occur. 
  [Jazulit] Engineer al-'Attas, you are well-known as a 
statesman. At the same time, you are one of the YSP's leaders. 
I know, and you know too, that before the union between the two 
parts of Yemen was proclaimed, there were people in this party 
who rejected the union on the grounds that the time was not yet 
ripe for it. Apparently a few people in the YSP monopolized the 
decisions and did not take into account the general attitude of 
the YSP leaders and members. On this basis you embarked on a 
union which lasted for four years and then you returned to Aden. 
Do you hold yourselves responsible for the union's failure? 
  [Al-'Attas] Without a doubt, we bear some responsibility for 
the failure of the Yemeni union experiment. However, I totally 
agree with the view of Shaykh Sulayman Abu-Luhum. When the 
president asked him: Why do you criticize me, not the YSP and 
the southerners? He answered him: You bear 70 percent of the 
responsibility for the failure. The YSP bears 30 percent of the 
responsibility. 
  [Jazulit] Why does the president take 70 percent of the 
blame while you represent two basic parties in unified Yemen? 
  [Al-'Attas] When I speak of the president, I talk about the 
executive leadership in Sanaa. This leadership was a primary 
cause underlying the failure of this experience. I do not deny 
our responsibility. But compared to their responsibility, our 
responsibility is very slight. 
  [Jazulit] You did not reply to the second part of my 
question 
about your possible withstanding of self-criticism before the 
Yemeni people in the southern republic. 
  [Al-'Attas] We certainly exercise self-criticism all the 
time. When we make mistakes, we talk about our mistakes. The 
YSP in particular has been one of the parties that exercise 
self-criticism after each stage. Before unity, we criticized 
the prevailing situation and drew up a program for political and 
economic reform. I believe that self-criticism is a source of 
power; it makes room for progress and for avoiding mistakes. We 
certainly criticize ourselves when we make mistakes. Equally, 
when others make mistakes, we have to criticize them 
constructively. 
  [Jazulit] In your new republic, you raise the slogan of 
democracy and unity. Can you explain your strategy in the 
economic field? 
  [Al-'Attas] In our new policy in the Democratic Republic of 
Yemen, we are committed to developing the economy into a market 
economy and are working for economic freedom. This course is in 
full harmony with the democratic approach. It gives equal 
opportunities for competition, which means providing better 
services at lower prices. Therefore, we are working and will 
continue to work for establishing economic freedom and paving 
the way for private and share-holding companies to run the 
various aspects of the national economy within the framework of 
the state laws and legislations. In my view, this is an 
approach that enables us to develop, just like the approach of 
democratic political practice. It is true that this road is hard 
and long and involves a certain sacrifice, but it is the safe 
and guaranteed road to prosperity and social and economic 
development for all the masses. 
  [Jazulit] As long as we are talking about the economic 
approach, I learned that you are seriously contemplating 
applying to join the Gulf Cooperation Council. There is a 
geographic element involved. Moreover, you state that you are 
committed to a free economy. All these factors show that you 
are seriously pursuing that goal. Is this true? 
  [Al-'Attas] I believe that the states of the Arab 
archipelago 
must maintain the highest level of cooperation and coordination. 
  [Jazulit] What about joining the Gulf Cooperation Council? 
  [Al-'Attas] I believe that this is a good step that should 
be 
taken. 
  [Jazulit] A question before the end: Where does opposition 
stand in the political arena in your new republic? That is, of 
course, if there is opposition. During years of unity, the 
opposition played a central role in the meetings of the national 
dialogue committee. Its role was to reconcile the two major 
parties. After fighting broke out, unity disintegrated; some 
supported the south and are helping you in your new republic, 
while others stayed in and are getting support from Sanaa. The 
secession that led to the proclamation of a new republic here 
played a negative role at the opposition level and its future. 
Where does opposition stand in your new republic? 
  [Al-'Attas] In fact the opposition played an important role 
in phrasing the Pledge and Accord Document, the document because 
of which Sanaa launched a war. This is clear in the statements 
that started on 18 January and continued until a few days ago, 
when Sanaa added yet another condition, saying that it accepts 
negotiations, but not on the basis of the document. Why? 
Because the document was the right way to refute the divine 
authority claim of the executive leadership in Sanaa. That 
leadership thought that it had inherited the right to lead and 
hence it should continue to control Yemen. The Pledge and 
Accord Document would have ended such an era. But the leadership 
sensed that it was being threatened and launched war on Yemen. 
We are now in a state of war. The national unity that embraces 
all political and social powers is being enhanced in the 
institutions we established. Accordingly, the task of the 
government and the institutions we are building now is to remove 
the impact of war. 
  [Jazulit] Then is it a provisional government? 
  [Al-'Attas] Yes, a provisional government. As declared in 
the proclamation of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, we will 
prepare for local government and parliamentary elections within 
a year, God willing. 
  [Jazulit] You are coming closer to decisive developments. 
  [Al-'Attas] Certainly. But we feel safe, because everyone 
here will act in a civilized and responsible manner. No one 
will carry a machine gun, gun, or bomb. All citizens in the 
southern and eastern governorates are marching along the road of 
democracy peacefully. Therefore, we expect democracy to 
flourish. No citizen will be coerced or subjected to injustice 
or oppression in the Democratic Republic of Yemen. 
  [Jazulit] Engineer al-'Attas; thank you for this meeting. 
  [Al-'Attas] Thank you very much.

  [Text] Cairo, 3 Jun (MENA) -- 'Abdallah al-Asnaj, who was 
recently appointed deputy prime minister and foreign minister of 
South Yemen, has appealed to President Husni Mubarak to act to 
save the Yemeni people from the continuing war. In a message to 
President Mubarak, he expressed his thanks to him and to the 
Egyptian people for the consideration given him during his stay 
in Egypt, which lasted for more than 10 years. 
  Al-Asnaj also sent a message to the Gulf Cooperation Council 
foreign ministers expressing his utmost appreciation for their 
interest in developments in Yemen since the UN Security Council 
passed a resolution calling on the Yemeni parties to immediately 
halt the war and start negotiations.

  [Text] Cairo, 4 Jun (MENA) -- 'Abdallah al-Asnaj, who has 
been recently appointed deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister in south Yemen, has stated that what must be done now 
is to stop the war in Yemen and open the door for capable and 
desirable Arab mediation, as represented by President Husni 
Mubarak and United Arab Emirates' President Shaykh Zayid 
Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan. 
  In an exclusive interview with MENA deputy chief editor 
Jalal 
Salim, al-Asnaj said that the ongoing war in Yemen has left 
approximately 80,000 people dead, wounded, or homeless. He 
pointed out that the real loser in this war is the Yemeni people 
before their leaders, since the war has seriously harmed the 
people's interests and institutions. He added that the 
advocates of war must return to reason and heed the appeals of 
their Arab brothers and the calls of the international community 
to start negotiations among the Yemeni parties concerned. 
  Asked if there were flaws when the Yemen unity was declared 
four years ago that have led to the current situation, al-Asnaj 
said: Naturally, there was a major flaw in the composition of 
the Yemeni unity because it preceded the preparations for the 
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, as if it were tailored to suit Iraq's 
plan for expansion in the region. He noted that major 
components of the unity, which enjoys the support of the Yemeni 
people throughout the country, were lacking. He added: Two 
armies remained in Yemen, one in the north and another in the 
south. Two financial institutions, two diplomatic 
representations, two departments for security and general 
intelligence existed before and remained after the unity. In 
addition, the riyal remained the currency in the north and the 
dinar the currency in the south after the unity. 
  Al-Asnaj noted that the existing contradictions between the 
north and the south, in terms of the makeup of each society, had 
also been overlooked. The north, he added, is a society of 
tribes, the military, and the leadership, while in the south 
there are developed administrative institutions where 
experienced and qualified people find the opportunities they 
deserve on an equal footing, unlike the north, where 
opportunities go to the privileged and the loyal only. 
  Explaining the contradictions on which the Yemeni unity was 
based, al-Asnaj said that four years after this unity was 
declared, differences deepened and the views of the Yemeni 
Socialist Party and its representatives in the south and 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his representatives in the 
north were not harmonious. He added that a third party, the 
Yemeni Reform Grouping, entered the composition of the bilateral 
alliance which had concluded the unity agreement after general 
elections were held in Yemen 14 months ago. 
  He noted that the ruling alliance became tripartite with the 
entry of the Yemeni Reform Grouping, which is a political 
organization comprising the Hashid Tribe and the (?politicized) 
Islamic Movement in Yemen and has links with Sudan. This, he 
said, prompted further (?contradictions) within the authority 
structure which made the Yemeni Socialist Party feel that its 
role in achieving unity had been ignored and that its equality 
with the northern side had diminished to a great extent. 
  Al-Asnaj explained that this situation had a direct effect 
on 
the ordinary citizens in the southern governorates when 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih decided that his men should run 
the southern governorates' affairs beginning with the post of 
governor and ending with the posts of customs directors. 
  He said the Yemeni citizen in the south suffered 
complications in handling his daily affairs, in addition to the 
increase in cost of living and the spreading unemployment. In 
light of these negative developments, he said, the unity became 
a source of misery for the southern citizen and a source of 
prosperity for the minority in the north. He went on to say 
that this explains part of the problems that exist today and 
which led to this war that we witness with pain. 
  Replying to a question on the Yemeni unity's fate and future 
in light of the current circumstances, he said "the government 
in the south" is eager to assert its belief in and concern for 
its right to reformulate the Yemeni unity in a manner that will 
erase the memory of the "pools of blood" that have been shed 
under the slogan of a false legitimacy and under undesired 
protection because the unity existed only on paper. 
  He accused Sanaa of unilaterally abrogating the Pledge and 
Accord Document recently and said: This gives the Yemeni public 
a new example of misbehavior. 
  He noted that anyone who declares war on his people and 
rejects the mediation of brothers and the international 
community, represented by the Security Council, loses all bases 
of constitutional legitimacy and every sense of struggle for the 
sake of the Yemeni people's unity because unity does not come 
about over the people's skulls. 
  He said that the "Democratic Republic of Yemen" will be an 
experiment and a beginning toward removing the peoples' 
bitterness and grudges that have led to a grinding war caused by 
Sanaa, which was enthusiastic about it. 
  Concluding the interview, al-Asnaj answered a question on 
his 
expectations about the recognition of the recently proclaimed 
government in south Yemen. He said there are Arab and 
international indications in this regard that might be announced 
soon.

<F P=106> [Interview with 'Abdallah al-Asnaj, "deputy prime minister </F>
and foreign minister in South Yemen," by Shadiyah Riyad; place 
and date not given --recorded] 
  [Text] [Riyad] Egypt and the Gulf states continue to push 
the UN Security Council resolution on a cease-fire in Yemen. Do 
you think that the Council will actually succeed in bringing 
about a cease-fire in Yemen? 
  [Al-Asnaj] The UN Security Council certainly has a 
responsibility; it also has influence with which it can 
guarantee states' compliance with its resolutions. This has 
been made clear in more than one country: Iraq, Korea, and many 
other tense areas. The UN Security Council has succeeded in 
guaranteeing adherence to the UN Charter's provisions on crises 
and tension. What is happening in Yemen is a war in all senses 
of the word. The states that sponsored the draft resolution 
that was unanimously adopted by the highest UN authority are 
directly concerned with what is happening in Yemen, with its 
pan-Arab and national security aspects and with the safety of 
the region's people. They are interested in eliminating the 
causes of tension that hamper the development of our Arab 
societies. 
  [Riyad] The entire world community is awaiting the outcome 
of 
the mission of Lakhdar Ibrahim, who is heading the fact-finding 
committee. Do you believe that his task will be easy? 
  [Al-Asnaj] The task is certainly not easy, but the UN 
resolution makes it easier. One side has accepted the 
provisions of the UN resolution and its unconditional 
implementation with no reservations or delays. The other side 
has announced that it accepts the resolution but has so far 
raised obstacles and made excuses to avoid responding. 
  I believe that Sanaa will find the noose tightened around 
it. 
I think it has to declare its actual position and its real 
intentions: Whether or not it will recognize the Yemeni people's 
right to determine their own fate, live in peace and safety, and 
scorn rulers who endanger their lives and public institutions. 
Sanaa is fully responsible for its decision to stop or continue 
this war. If it continues, the war will certainly not be in 
Sanaa's interest, because the international community will have 
taken a certain stance to deter the advocates of war in Yemen. 
  [Riyad] Saudi Foreign Minister Sa'ud al-Faysal said during 
the meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] foreign 
ministers that a continuing state of war in Yemen would reflect 
negatively on the Gulf states and that if it continues, the Gulf 
states will take certain measures to deal with it. What 
measures did he mean? 
  [Al-Asnaj] Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal was expressing the Saudi 
Kingdom's and the GCC's stand and their actual vision of the 
dimensions of this grim war and its serious repercussions on the 
region to which we belong. No political analyst would be 
surprised by al-Faysal's remarks, which express concern and a 
desire to eliminate the causes of tension and war in Yemen. 
Once again, it is Sanaa's responsibility either to continue to 
be a source of tension for Yemen and the region or to live in 
harmony with the region's people and respond to the Arab will. 
Egypt, Syria, and all the GCC states have said that the war in 
Yemen must stop and that everyone should return to the 
negotiations and find a political solution, after first 
unconditionally stopping the fighting. 
  [Riyad] You have accepted appointment as deputy prime 
minister and foreign minister. What is the nature of the job 
you have been entrusted with at this stage? 
  [Al-Asnaj] Whoever accepts responsibility at this stage must 
sincerely seek joint action with all the good elements in the 
Arab world--the shrewd leadership of which is embodied by the 
Arab Republic of Egypt, President Husni Mubarak, and all our 
brothers in the GCC--to end the state of war in Yemen and resume 
talks on a political solution that avoids hegemony, control, and 
military ambitions, for which there is no room in today's world. 
  [Riyad] There is talk about a federation between the north 
and south. Is this matter contemplated? 
  [Al-Asnaj] All these matters will be considered once the 
frenzied war stops. The political leadership in Sanaa insists 
on this war. It lost its legitimacy the minute it declared that 
war. 
  [Riyad] Thank you Mr. al-Asnaj. 
  [Al-Asnaj] Thank you.
