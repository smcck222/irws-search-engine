  [Text] Well-informed political and military sources have 
spoken about the political and military dilemma in which the 
ruling regime in Sanaa has found itself because it insists on 
continuing the war against the Democratic Republic of Yemen by 
seeking more military supplies. These sources linked the recent 
visits of Yahya Husayn al-Arashi, member of the Permanent 
Committee of the General People's Congress, and Muhammad 
'Abdallah (al-Yadumi), the third man in the Yemeni Alliance for 
Reform [al-Tajammu al-Yamani Li-al-Islah] to Khartoum and the 
visit paid to Sanaa today by the Sudanese minister of 
information, 'Abd-al-Basit Sabdarat, as the envoy of Sudanese 
President Lieutenant General 'Umar Hasan al-Bashir. The sources 
said the visit was linked to the question of military supplies 
sent from Sudan to the Sanaa regime.

administrative fields. The agreement was signed by Interior 
Minister Watban Ibrahim al-Hasan for Iraq and by his counterpart 
Salamah Hammad for Jordan. 
  During the signing ceremony, Interior Minister Watban

al-Hasan voiced happiness and satisfaction over the march of 
brotherly ties between Iraq and Jordan, as demonstrated by the 
joint programs and plans that were achieved during the talks.

comprehensive progress in building and reconstruction he saw in 
Iraq, as well as the unity and cohesion among the Iraqis and

schemes and threats aimed at infringing on their steadfastness 
and heroic defiance.

Iraq, and underlined the inevitability of the triumph of 
goodness and right, represented by Iraq under President Saddam

  [Text] Salah-al-Din, Iraq, June 4 (AFP) -- More than 600 
people are believed to have died in ongoing clashes between 
rival Kurdish groups at Halabjah in northeastern Iraq, a member 
of the opposition Iraqi National Congress said Saturday. 
  The source who asked not to be named said the clashes had 
left "probably more than 600 dead," most of them members of the 
Kurdistan Patriotic Union (KPU) [PUK] of Jalal Talabani. 
  The KPU said however that it had suffered few casualties. 
  Clashes erupted at the beginning of May in various parts of 
Kurdistan mainly between the KPU and its biggest rival the 
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) of Mas'ud al-Barzani. After a 
rash of ceasefires, hostilities died down at the end of May 
except in Halabjah and Qal'at Dizah near the border with Iran 
where the KPU is fighting a pro-Iranian group, the Kurdistan 
Islamic League (KIL). 
  The KIL led by Shaykh 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Uthman has allied 
itself 
with the KDP. 
  According to sources from all sides, the KPU has lost 
control 
of Halabjah after taking the village at the beginning of May. 
  A delegation including members of the INC and leaders of the 
warring factions is due to visit Halabjah to try to arrange a 
new ceasefire. 
  The Iranian news agency IRNA said Tuesday that since May 
about 4,000 people had been killed and hundreds injured in the 
fighting between Kurds. 
  The KDP and the KPU accused each other of executing 
prisoners 
taken during the fighting. The KDP gave the INC a list of 51 
names, saying they had been captured by the KPU and killed, INC 
sources said. 
  Amnesty International said in a recent report that the KPU 
had submitted 49 names of prisoners it said the KDP had executed.

  [Text] Brother Jalal Talabani, secretary general of the 
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK], announced last night, 
Friday, through the PUK television and radio stations in the 
region of Kurdistan a unilateral peaceful PUK initiative which 
aims to end the current crisis and to normalize the situation in 
the region. 
  This initiative aims to strengthen the spirit of brotherhood 
and cordiality among the sons of Kurdistan and to continue the 
reconstruction of what has been destroyed by the Iraqi regime's 
aggressive and [word indistinct] policies. The initiative also 
aims to consolidate the spirit of democratic freedoms and human 
rights in Kurdistan and to enable the region's government and 
elected parliament to exercise their work in the service of the 
sons of Kurdistan. 
  The initiative stressed the need to strengthen the alliance 
between the members of the Kurdistan Front, especially between 
the PUK and the Kurdistan Democratic Party [KDP], so as to 
proceed with the unification of all resources and capabilities 
on solid bases and to direct them against our people's enemies 
and the dictatorial regime in order to bring it down and 
establish a democratic, federal, and pluralistic regime in Iraq. 
  Brother Talabani said in his announcement: To achieve these 
noble and legitimate objectives, the PUK has, on its part, 
decided the following: 
  1. To stop the fighting immediately and unconditionally, to 
withdraw all the PUK forces from the areas of (?fighting), and 
to return these forces to their former bases under the 
supervision of the Kurdistan Front and the Unified Iraqi 
National Congress [UINC]. 
  2. To release all persons detained and arrested by the PUK. 
  3. To stop all forms of media campaign and not to reply to 
media campaigns. 
  4. To let all government employees affiliated with the PUK 
return to their departments immediately so as to extend their 
services to the citizens. 
  The brother secretary general expressed his thanks and 
gratitude to all the sons of Irbil for their noble feelings and 
sincere efforts to calm and normalize the situation. He also 
sincerely thanked the sons of al-Sulaymaniyah for their goodwill 
efforts for that purpose. Brother Jalal expressed his gratitude 
to all the officials and leaders of the parties in the Kurdistan 
Front, the UNIC, the KDP, the PUK, and other Kurdish political 
forces for their sincere efforts to put an end to the 
extraordinary situation and normalize the situation as quickly 
as possible. He also thanked the Kurdish and Iraqi parties, 
especially the Assyrian and Turkmen ones, and also the 
professional and mass organizations for their serious and great 
efforts to tackle the problem, for their desire to uphold the 
atmosphere of brotherhood, love, and cordiality, and for 
presenting peaceful solutions to all the differences. 
  Brother Jalal Talabani called on all our people in Kurdistan 
to act and to take the following facts into account: 
  1. To take care of the spirit of brotherhood and peace 
between us in view of its positive effects at the domestic and 
foreign level. 
  2. To achieve a comprehensive and general reconciliation 
that will include all the parties in Kurdistan. 
  3. To condemn the violations of human rights and deviations 
from Kurdish, revolutionary, and Islamic values and norms. 
  4. Not to squander the foreign support and backing by 
speeding up the efforts to tackle problems, reorganize 
ourselves, and let the region's government and parliament 
perform their normal duties. 
  Brother Talabani referred to: the need to consolidate 
security and to maintain the brotherly ties and the atmosphere 
of cordiality and rapport in the region of Kurdistan; the need 
to unite all the forces and efforts in order to confront the 
plots of our people's enemies who want to thwart this 
experiment, pour oil on fire, and sow sedition and conflict. 
  Brother Jalal called on all to rally and cooperate to entomb 
these vile plots being hatched by our people's enemies and to 
stand together in one trench against the enemies instead of 
standing in opposing trenches. 
  He demanded the immediate and rapid implementation of the 
clauses mentioned in the initiative. 
  Concluding his initiative, brother Jalal Talabani called on 
the struggling masses of Kurdistan, all their political forces, 
and all the faithful sons of our people to work together toward 
consolidating law and order, strengthening democracy and human 
rights, protecting our people's gains without being selfish, and 
working together toward having a Kurdistan where we all enjoy 
freedom, democratic, and human rights.

  [Text] Irbil, Iraq, June 5 (AFP) -- Iraqi Kurdistan's main 
leaders, Mas'ud Barzani and Jalal Talabani, met here Sunday for 
the first time since fierce clashes broke out between their 
rival factions a month ago. 
  The meeting in the northern Iraqi town of Irbil took place 
at 
the initiative of the Iraqi National Congress (INC), a coalition 
of Arab and Kurdish groups opposed to President Saddam Husayn. 
  The INC announced after the talks that a new joint operation 
room was being formed to implement a ceasefire between Barzani's 
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and Talabani's Patriotic Union 
of Kurdistan (PUK). 
  The PUK leader, abroad when the fighting broke out in early 
May, was airlifted back to northern Iraq last week on board a 
Turkish helicopter to overfly KDP-controlled areas. 
  After several ceasefire accords, calm returned to most of 
Iraqi Kurdistan at the end of May. But fresh clashes erupted 
Saturday in the regions of Halabjah and Qal'at al-Dizah, near 
the Iranian border, according to the CNI. 
  The CNI says more than 600 people are believed to been 
killed 
in the power struggle between the PUK and KDP, which have 
controlled northern Iraq in defiance of Baghdad since the 
aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Faris Buwayz' Statement to AL-SHARQ </F>
AL-AWSAT: Beirut Denies Existence of Secret Negotiations With 
Tel Aviv, Stresses No Plan To Evacuate Palestinians"] 
  [Excerpt] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT--Lebanese Foreign 
Minister Faris Buwayz has denied that there are any secret 
negotiations between Lebanon and Israel like those held between 
the Palestinians and the Israelis in Oslo. He said that the 
negotiations held between us are those conducted in the 
framework of the declared peace negotiations with the other Arab 
delegations. 
  Answering a question put to him by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT during 
his visit to Jordan, he said: We have not received any Israeli 
plans regarding withdrawal from southern Lebanon, neither 
through U.S. diplomacy nor any other quarters. 
  He added that the Lebanese position has always been clear 
since the Madrid conference, as we refused to sit with the 
Israelis or to discuss any partial solution. Nor did we accept 
anything except full withdrawal from Lebanese territory. 
  He stressed that Israel is trying, by means of unclear 
plans, 
to dissolve Resolution 425, which stipulates full withdrawal 
from Lebanese territory. We are calling for the implementation 
of all the UN resolutions, including Resolution 425 concerning 
Lebanon. Buwayz also stressed the need to continue and intensify 
coordination among the Arab parties concerned with the peace 
negotiations, as he regards it as support for the positions of 
the delegations participating in the peace negotiations. 
  On the Palestinian self-rule agreement Buwayz said: What the 
Palestinians brothers have arrived at with the Israelis 
regarding "Gaza-Jericho" is an achievement -- which reflects 
positively on the other negotiation tracks and opens the door to 
progress on the other tracks. 
  Buwayz warned of Israel's intentions in trying to divide 
solutions and single out the Arab parties individually in order 
to impose Israel's will and ambitions on the Arab states. It is 
always trying -- through trial balloons -- to agree a solution 
with this or that party regarding such and such. All these 
things are trial balloons for all the Arab tracks. 
  Buwayz denied that his country has any plan to evacuate 
400,000 Palestinians who have been living in Lebanon for several 
years and who hold Lebanese travel documents. He said: All the 
rumors in this connection are untrue, and we are not at all 
thinking of evacuating our Palestinian brothers. But we support 
their right to return to their land and recover their legitimate 
rights. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Lebanon has affirmed it will not withdraw from the 
peace negotiations regardless of Israeli pressures. Foreign 
Minister Faris Buwayz has told the newspaper AL-SAFIR that the 
Madrid Conference formula is second to none, in the absence of 
any alternative formula. But the problems do not rest with the 
formula; rather they rest with Israel's dealing with this 
formula, the foreign minister added. 
  Fariz Buwayz said: Despite its acceptance in theory or 
principle of this formula since it was initiated in Madrid, 
Israel has been ceaselessly trying to torpedo this formula. The 
foreign minister maintained that since the start Israel has been 
trying to isolate and separate out parties. It continues this 
policy even now and is trying to torpedo the Madrid Conference 
mechanism. 
  In his statement to AL-SAFIR, the foreign minister said that 
a withdrawal from the negotiations would trigger various 
repercussions. Therefore, it would not be in Lebanon's interest 
to withdraw from the negotiations. This would make Lebanon 
appear before the world public as a rejector of peace, 
particularly since Israel can exploit this issue in the media, 
Buwayz added. 
  The foreign minister said: We must continue the negotiations 
because there is no other mechanism that is supported and 
sponsored internationally. We also must not throw in our cards 
before the end of the negotiations. 
  Minister Buwayz pointed out that he had informed the 
Americans of Lebanon's commitment to continuing its resistance 
as long as there are insufficient assurances of the liberation 
of its land. Buwayz affirmed that the aggression against 
Ba'labakk was a new Israeli attempt to strike at Lebanese-Syrian 
cohesion. 
  The foreign minister criticized the Gaza-Jericho agreement, 
adding that Lebanon's ties with the Palestinian issue are clear. 
But as for Lebanon's relations with the Palestinian leadership, 
I believe that this leadership must propose a final concept and 
strategy so that we can finally define our relations with them. 
But defining a relationship to a structure based on transient 
principles is absolutely impossible, the foreign minister 
concluded.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz by Salim </F>
Badawi; place and date not given; from "The Event" 
program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Buwayz] As a matter of fact, we think the Security 
Council is now facing a a basic and vital test. We believe that 
what happened yesterday is a declaration of war, and not only a 
circumstantial, temporary, or objective aggression. What 
happened was a series of air raids by Israeli aircraft and 
helicopters, using all methods, including incendiary bombs, and 
the pursuit of civilians who escaped the region, by military 
helicopters. This action is absolutely unjustified and can only 
be within a process of war launched by Israel against Lebanon. 
  We think the United Nations, which has recently not 
responded 
to several attacks that took place, is now facing a test. It 
either proves its credibility and its raison d'etre as a frame 
of reference for the nations that are attacked, or it proves 
once again that it is incapable of adopting positions that 
establish justice and right in this world. Therefore, Lebanon 
has filed a complaint with the Security Council asking for an 
immediate session to discuss the second Israeli attack within 
less than 10 days. I believe the climate that surrounds this 
issue -- and updating public opinion in Lebanon on this issue 
-- are part of the test of the Security Council's credibility 
and seriousness. 
  [Badawi] Mr. Minister Buwayz, in case the Security Council 
does not immediately respond to Lebanon's request, what are the 
options and channels open to you? 
  [Buwayz] I think I have already given the answer. We are 
facing exposed and unmistakable aggression of clear magnitude. 
This aggression martyred around 50 people and left more than 60 
people wounded without any justification. We think that if the 
Security Council does not act, then we have already provided the 
answer to this. 
  [Badawi] In concrete terms, what are you going to ask the 
Security Council to do to deter Israel from carrying out other 
operations? 
  [Buwayz] First of all, a clear and unequivocal resolution by 
the Security Council to condemn the Israeli action. Second, we 
demand the implementation of the resolution by adopting all 
measures to implement Resolution 425. For, it is not acceptable 
to pile up resolutions in Security Council files and offices 
unless these resolutions have the power of implementation. We 
absolutely cannot understand how the Security Council acted and 
found all the capabilities regarding some of the issues 
worldwide, which especially seek to tame some Arab countries, 
but when these resolutions are meant against Israel, the 
Security Council is unable to do anything. 
  [Badawi] Mr. Minister, my final question: What is your 
comment on the reports or analyses that these repeated Israeli 
operations against Lebanon are linked with the negotiating 
tracks, particularly with Syria, and that these operations are a 
kind of a message from Israel to Damascus? 
  [Buwayz] Of course, I do not want to talk about the messages 
addressed by Israel, and to whom. There are messages addressed 
to the Israeli Army perhaps to boost its morale; there are 
messages addressed to Lebanon and Syria, etc. However, what is 
clear and certain is that Israel is trying to pressure Lebanon 
and Syria by what happened yesterday and is trying to eliminate 
the negotiating cards of Syria and Lebanon to embarrass them. 
  [Badawi] Thank you, Mr. Minister.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul by Salim </F>
Badawi; place and date not given; from the "The Event" 
program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Dallul] The situation in Lebanon is particularly 
solid. The unity of the Lebanese has precedence over all other 
issues. All concerned are alive to their responsibilities, 
because the enemy is bent on splitting Lebanon, a goal we are 
anxious to foil. The martyrs who fell in this treacherous raid 
are all Lebanon's martyrs. Today all the Lebanese are in 
mourning to illustrate the condemnation by all sectors of the 
Lebanese people of this barbaric massacre, the likes of which 
was not perpetrated even in the Nazi days. We are solidly 
united to counter Israel's attempts that seem bent on 
treacherously striking our people and the reconciliation and 
healing process in Lebanon. 
  [Badawi] Mr. Minister, we hear about Israeli troops 
concentrations; we also hear the Israeli Prime Minister issue 
threats. What kind of counter strategy is the Lebanese 
Government adopting? 
  [Dallul] We are resolved to deploy all means at our 
disposal. We are a people that are being victimized. Israel has 
committed countless acts of aggression against us. Israel 
occupies a part of our territory. Where is the international 
community? Why does the international community act on minor 
issues, but does nothing to curb Israel's aggression? Israel 
has consistently enjoyed a privileged status at the United 
Nations and the UN Security Council. The armed forces of the 
West were sent to force Iraq into complying with a Security 
Council resolution. But the international community and the 
United Nations never apply pressure on Israel to make it abide 
by Security Council resolutions. We are witnessing the bizarre 
situation of Israel going too far in striking a defenseless 
people below the belt, and the international community and the 
United Nations are turning a blind eye to these acts of 
aggression. 
  The Lebanese people will not stand for their sovereignty, 
dignity, and independence being trampled underfoot. We will 
confront all aggressions no matter what the cost. All of us 
will turn into a resistance. Israel will not manage to realize 
its goals. It is aware that any attempt on its part to extend 
the territory under its occupation will be very costly. We are 
all mobilized to face all eventualities that may arise from 
Yitzhaq Rabin's and other Israeli leaders' threats. 
  [Badawi] Minister Dallul, in the aftermath of the 
abduction of al-Dirani a few days ago, and then yesterday's raid 
and the international silence over these acts committed by 
Israel, is it possible to say the Lebanese resistance against 
Israeli occupation forces has lost its international cover? 
  [Dallul] The resistance has no need for such a cover. The 
resistance is doing a patriotic job; it is resisting occupation. 
  [Badawi] How, then, do you explain the American silence 
since 
al-Dirani's abduction? 
  [Dallul] I don't know; this is a question for the United 
States to answer. However, what the international community 
must understand is that leaving Israel's recklessness 
unchallenged serves no one's interests. Israel is not targeting 
the Lebanese resistance; it is directing its fire at an 
innocent, defenseless, unarmed people. It is torching 
agricultural fields and implements and detonating the homes of 
the elderly and children. Israel is not facing resistance; it 
is targeting the Lebanese people; it is targeting all of 
Lebanon. Formerly, Israel worked through agents on Lebanese 
territory. But since the Lebanese security agencies uncovered 
these cells and their members were put behind bars, Israel has 
begun to perpetrate these massacres, having lost the benefit of 
the services of its agents. Or maybe it no longer has a 
sufficient number of agents to carry out such acts of terror. 
  [Badawi] Don't you read in these acts that have been going 
on 
for days a message to the Lebanese Government that it must 
disarm Hizballah, as a prelude to a security agreement with 
Lebanon within the context of the peace negotiations? 
  [Dallul] We will not put the cart before the horse. We work 
according to the political logic of things. We have a force of 
occupation in our country. This occupation must be removed. 
Israel's withdrawal comes before anything else. We have stated 
that in the event of Israel's pullout not a single operation 
will be allowed to originate in Lebanese territory. We have 
also stated that the only weapons that will be deployed in the 
border areas will be those of the legitimate Lebanese government. 
  [Badawi] Following Israel's raid yesterday, northern Israel 
was hit by Katyusha rockets, despite a kind of year-long truce. 
Does that mean that the tacit agreement is now finished? 
  [Dallul] The Israeli arm has reached as far as the center 
and fringes of the al-Biqa'. Israel's shells hit 12- and 
14-year olds, and they abducted a Lebanese citizen. What kind 
of truce are you talking about? 
  [Badawi] We may assume, then, further escalation, as 
happened last year? 
  [Dallul] We expect everything. As long as Israel takes our 
people and security and homeland for granted, why should we 
stand by with our hands tied? If we did, we would be lax in the 
discharge of our duties. We are not such people. 
  [Badawi] Thanks to his excellency, Minister Muhsin Dallul.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Information Minister Michel </F>
Samahah in Beirut by Ashraf 'Abd-al-'Aziz in Cairo; date not 
given; from the "Dialogue from Afar" program--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Can you brief us on the current 
situation in southern Lebanon? 
  [Samahah] Tension currently prevails in southern Lebanon. 
At the beginning of this interview, I want to remind everyone 
of the facts of the situation, which are being ignored by 
Israeli and world media. Southern Lebanon is Lebanese territory 
that is occupied by Israel. The Israelis have occupied this 
Lebanese territory just as they have occupied other Arab 
territory in the Golan, Jordan, and Palestine. Consequently, 
Lebanon is a constant victim of aggression in the south and the 
western al-Biqa'. The continuation of attacks deep inside 
Lebanese territory, as happened recently in the Ba'labakk area, 
and the daily bombardment of Lebanese villages are a continuing 
dual aggression. On one hand, there is occupation; and on the 
other is the aggression against peaceful Lebanese citizens 
inside the liberated areas adjacent to southern Lebanon and the 
western al-Biqa'. There is tension now, following the recent 
Israeli military buildup on the Israeli-Lebanese border. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] You have clearly explained the situation in 
southern Lebanon and the recent Israeli military buildup on the 
border. What, in your view, is the reason for Israel's 
escalation of its aggression against Lebanese territory at this 
particular time? 
  [Samahah] Israel is facing a dilemma in the negotiations. It 
has reached the stage of returning their rights to the Arab 
owners, whether in southern Lebanon and western al-Biqa, the 
Golan, in the occupied Palestinian territory, or in Jordan. 
Consequently, it is facing the bitter fact that it must give 
back these territories under the pressure of world public 
opinion and of the U.S. and Russian cosponsors of the talks. 
This poses a predicament for the Israeli Government in dealing 
with world public opinion and the cosponsors of the Madrid peace 
conference. [passage omitted] 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Regarding Lebanese activity on the 
international level and through the UN Security Council, can we 
expect the Security Council to issue a resolution on the recent 
Israeli aggression against Lebanon? 
  [Samahah] I hope the Security Council will continue to serve 
the security of the whole UN Organization. This organization 
and its Security Council have a duty to protect the rights of 
states and peoples within the framework of existing 
international laws. We hope that in the next few days or in the 
next phase we will not again see a double standard regarding 
attacks by one state on another. The Lebanese Government is 
holding contacts with the Security Council members to encourage 
a resolution condemning this aggression and demanding that 
Israel implement Resolution 425, which is the basis on which 
Lebanon has joined the comprehensive and just peace talks.

  [Excerpt] After taking part in the funeral of the martyrs 
of the Israeli raid at Rawdat al-Shahidayn Mosque at 1100 today, 
Hizballah Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah stressed that the 
confrontation with the enemy will continue until the land is 
liberated. He called for withdrawing from negotiations with the 
enemy and for not relying on the UN Security Council. He called 
for making the resistance a general national plan. He said that 
the resistance is the rock on which the occupation will founder 
and the homeland will be unified. He declared that the 
resistance has been born anew with the fall of the martyrs 
yesterday. He stressed that any peace given to the killers of 
prophets and people and the usurpers of land and sanctities is a 
disgrace no matter what the justifications and circumstances.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with 'Ali 'Ammar of the "Bloc for </F>
Allegiance to the Resistance" in the Chamber of Deputies, by 
Salim Badawi; place and date not given; from "The Event" 
program--recorded] 
  [Text] ['Ammar] First, I would like to stress that the 
recent Israeli aggression is not the first and will not be the 
last. Since its establishment, Israel has been driven by a 
spirit of aggression and tyranny. Therefore, we are not amazed 
by any act produced by this deep-rooted Israeli aggressive 
spirit. All that we want to affirm to the international, 
regional, and local public opinion is that resistance in Lebanon 
will remain. It will not be discouraged by those blows, 
irrespective of how strong they are in terms of the disasters 
and the pain that they leave. 
  This resistance is the product of a free national, popular 
will representing all Lebanese and all the free people in the 
world. In this regard, we would like to stress that the more 
blows they deal to the Lebanese and the resistance, the stronger 
and more determined this resistance becomes to continue its 
jihad and its approach, in order to enable our individual and 
land to attain freedom and independence, which are the token of 
our existence, especially at this critical stage. However, in 
view of this sick reality, the double standards of the U.S. 
Administration, and of the West in general and their biased view 
toward matters and issues that are related to peoples' freedom, 
pain us and incline us to hold those administrations politically 
and otherwise fully responsible for Israel's aggression. Israel 
would not have dared to defy all international resolutions, 
human rights, people's freedom, countries' sovereignty, and 
peoples' independence had it not been this U.S.-Western cover 
which provides it with all the elements of strength, in terms of 
money, weapons, and policy as well. 
  As for our reaction, our natural reaction is continued 
resistance until all the holy land and our individuals are 
liberated from all the effects resulting from the marriage 
between U.S.-Western and Israeli interests on the basis of the 
spirit of colonialism and aggression. 
  [Badawi] Haj 'Ali 'Ammar, first there was the operation that 
targeted and resulted in the kidnapping of Mustafa al-Dirani. A 
few later, attacks continued until they culminated in the 
Israeli raid against one of your positions in the al-Biqa' area, 
leaving dozens of victims. Do you not view these repeated 
Israeli attacks as a preparation for a certain objective that 
Israel has for some time been seeking to achieve, namely, 
liquidating Lebanese resistance and putting pressure on the 
Syrian-Lebanese negotiator by striking at Hizballah, Hizballah 
leaders, and the resistance? 
  ['Ammar] Your question is politically multifaceted. I would 
like to clearly and frankly answer all the points included in 
your question. First, regarding the liquidation of the 
resistance, I would like to stress a point which is known well 
by Israel and the U.S. Administration: The resistance in 
Lebanon is not an armed organization or a specific group of 
Lebanese taking care of it. 
  Resistance in Lebanon has become part of every child, woman, 
and old person. It has dug its roots deep into the Lebanese 
people and the Lebanese territory, beginning with those in their 
mothers' wombs, and ending with those elite struggling in a 
world that has lost its freedom, after freedom has been denied 
all factors of support and strength as a result of the arrogant 
Western-Israeli plotting against the region. This resistance is 
not easy to liquidate. This is despite the fact that we do not 
deny that there is a disparity between the strength of the 
resistance and that of the U.S. war machine that Israel is using 
to kill our people, children, and women, and to dominate our 
territory. However, the weapon of the resistance is in its 
being in the heart of those broad masses who took to the streets 
today to bury their martyrs and make their message quite clear. 
The gathering has been a true referendum as to the extent of 
support for the resistance. 
  ['Ammar] Concerning the liquidation of the resistance, as 
we said the resistance is not an armed group with a limited base 
to be liquidated in this way. The real liquidation of the 
resistance can be effected by wiping out all levels of Lebanese 
society and annihilating the revolutionary and the ideological 
spirit which these people have been imbibing throughout history. 
  As for the issue of the negotiations, the second issue I 
would like to talk about, you are aware that since the beginning 
of the negotiating process, from Madrid until now, we have never 
seen any benefit coming from these negotiations at all, because 
we perfectly believe that in light of the colonialist U.S. 
single-handed dealing with the region and in light of the 
aggressive spirit represented by Israel, which flouts all 
values, norms, and all the international, cultural, and 
humanitarian conventions, it is impossible to sit with this 
enemy at the negotiating table in any form whatsoever. If by 
these strikes Israel wants to influence the Lebanese and Syrian 
negotiators, and the Arab negotiators in general, we have said 
from the beginning that we have nothing to do with these 
negotiations and their results. I do not believe this situation 
will end in capitulation to Israeli demands, whether on the 
diplomatic level of negotiations or on the level of jihad, which 
we believe in and which we insist on continuing until the 
liberation of all the sacred soil. 
  Therefore, I would like to say--and let public opinion be 
well aware of this--that the resistance is not a link in 
political investment or blackmail, neither on the negotiating 
table or away from it. This is because the resistance is the 
choice of people who want to be free and independent. 
  [Badawi] On the practical side, within his warnings and 
threats, Yitzhaq Rabin asked the United States to intercede with 
Syria so Damascus would pressure you to stop your shelling of 
northern Israel. How true is this information? Have you 
received anything, any indications, any demands or requests from 
the Lebanese or Syrian authorities to stop the resumption of 
missile attacks on northern Israel? 
  ['Ammar] First of all, our relations with sisterly Syria are 
strategic relations which cannot be affected by a casual event, 
be it an Israeli attack or anything else. We are aware that 
this recent spirit of aggression and the recent attacks were 
aimed at confusing the internal situation in Lebanon and 
disturbing the ties with fraternal Syria. We harbor 
appreciation and respect for Syria and its leader al-Asad for 
his sponsoring the resistance and for his defense of it and his 
protection throughout the recent history we have passed through. 
As for us being asked, we cannot allow anybody to demand 
anything from us, especially if the demand is related to our 
freedom, independence, self-respect, and our protection of our 
sanctities. We and al-Asad's Syria are on the same frontline 
against this Israeli aggression and domination and will not 
allow the Israeli-U.S. terms to pass even by one iota at the 
expense of our people. 
  [Badawi] Therefore, the confrontation is there, the Israeli 
threats exists. Will you continue to shell the Israeli 
territory in case the Israeli Army attacks continue? You are, 
of course, aware that this will again lead to justifying an 
Israeli invasion of Lebanese territory, as happened last year? 
  ['Ammar] Since the beginning of the resistance against the 
unjust Israeli occupation, we have adopted a sacred slogan, 
namely, kill us, because this will make our people more and more 
aware. We as a people have had a spiritual upbringing that 
rejects oppression, iniquity, occupation, and domination in any 
form whatsoever. We are free to use all the means available to 
us to defend our freedom, dignity, and independence. We will 
not spare any method to hurt this enemy, give it pain, and expel 
it form our land, and to remove all the effects of the 
international and regional imbalance on the military, political, 
and material levels. We do not care what the Israelis think. 
Our main concern is to defend freedom with all means available 
to us. Yes, the battle is open. Let them wipe us out if they 
want. If we can wipe them out, we will not hesitate to do so.

  [Text] A state of top alert prevails among the Israeli 
occupation forces and their puppet militia, on one side, and the 
Lebanese Army and the Lebanese resistance groups, on the other. 
  The NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY has learned that the UN Interim 
Force in Lebanon has placed the personnel manning its 
checkpoints on alert. It also beefed up the checkpoints with 
additional troops. 
  The occupation forces have mobilized additional troops 
inside 
the occupied border strip. Convoys of tanks, military vehicles, 
and troop carriers have been deployed on the hills overlooking 
the liberated areas near the international border. 
  According to security sources, the Israeli occupation forces 
have deployed long-range mobile artillery on the Muhaybib and 
al-'Abbad hills, and Jabal Humayd. 
  AFP reported today that large numbers of Israeli tanks, 
armored vehicles, artillery pieces, and troops carriers were 
deployed on the Lebanese-Israeli international border but did 
not cross. 
  Meanwhile, contrary to some media's claims, no flood of 
refugees has been reported from the areas under attack despite 
the atmosphere of tension there.

  [Text] The Islamic Resistance has announced that one of its 
groups spotted a Zionist patrol on the Bi'r Kallab-al-Rayhan

minutes, using machine guns and rockets. A large number of 
enemy personnel were killed and wounded. Three Islamic 
Resistance fighters were martyred.

inside the occupied border strip after continuing acts of 
aggression. The Israeli occupation forces in Tallat Sujud 
bombarded the Iqlim al-Tuffah hills at 1600 today. The sporadic 
bombardment reached Mlita, al-Luwayzah, and Mlikh. The Israeli 
forces raked al-Luwayzah with heavy machine-gun fire for 30 
minutes. 
  The Israeli forces in al-Qantarah pounded Qabrikha with 
about 
20 tank rounds at 0600 today, causing damage to property. They 
also pounded the valleys and hills surrounding Qabrikha. They 
shelled the same area last night. At dawn today, the Israeli 
forces raked the Jabal al-Rafi' in Iqlim al-Tuffah with heavy 
machine guns and illuminated the area with flares. Israeli 
helicopters staged several sorties over al-Shaqif castle, Kafr 
Tibnit, 'Ali al-Tahir, and al-Burj. [passage omitted] 
  The Islamic Resistance issued a statement saying that three 
members were martyred in an encounter between its groups and the 
Israeli occupation forces in the Bi'r Kallab-Sujud area last 
night. The funeral of the three martyrs took place this 
afternoon. [passage omitted] 
  An Israeli gunboat this afternoon intercepted a Lebanese 
commercial ship coming from Germany off Tyre and subjected it to 
a search that lasted for several hours.

areas in the south and western al-Biqa'. The occupation forces 
last night machine-gunned the Habbush valley and al-Wadi 
al-Akhdar from their position in al-Suwayda'. They directed 
sniper fire at the Habbush road. 
  Israeli helicopters flew over al-Tayyibah and al-Qantarah at 
2315 yesterday. Helicopters also flew over the villages of the 
western sector and the plain south of Tyre after midnight last 
night, dropping flares over these areas. 
  Enemy aircraft were seen over Tyre at 1200 today. 
  Security sources in southern Lebanon have reported that the 
occupation forces brought into the occupied border strip tanks, 
armored personnel carriers, and long-range artillery and 
deployed them on the hills overlooking the areas adjacent to the 
occupied part of the south.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' has said Israel's 
aggression yesterday against Lebanese cities and villages, which 
claimed the lives of more than 45 martyrs and left more than 80 
wounded, is an attempt to shift from the climate of peace to a 
climate of war and liquidation, in a bid to evade a commitment 
to UN resolutions, international legitimacy, and international 
law. 
  Addressing the closing session of the 11th ministerial 
conference of the foreign ministers of the Nonaligned Movement 
[NAM] today, al-Shar' said the NAM countries are eager to foster 
the success of international efforts to achieve a just and 
comprehensive peace in the Middle East on the basis of Security 
Council resolutions, international legitimacy, and the 
land-for-peace principle. 
  The foreign minister said the Israeli attacks and Israel's 
preoccupation with attacking Arab parties involved in the peace 
process is clear evidence of its aggressive intentions to kill 
the available opportunity to achieve peace. 
  Al-Shar' asked the conference to demonstrate solidarity with 
the Lebanese people and government and the Lebanese people's 
right to self-defense by using all available means -- a right 
guaranteed by the UN Charter. 
  The foreign minister wondered if some people think this 
Israeli aggression is directed against a certain party or 
country or a neighboring country in order to embarrass a 
particular country. Al- Shar' said this aggression is directed 
against the international community as a whole, and particularly 
against the cosponsors of the peace process, the United States 
and Russia, more than it is directed against Lebanon, Syria, or 
the NAM. 
  The foreign minister called on the NAM to raise its voice 
and 
issue a decision condemning the criminal aggression carried out 
by Israel yesterday so Israel understands that it cannot fool 
the world by its claims that it is working for peace at a time 
when it is pushing the region to the brink of war. 
  Al-Shar' concluded that he was confident that the conference 
will reassert its solidarity with the Lebanese people, calling 
for issuing a decision that strongly condemns Israel's actions. 
He said the ministerial conference should ask the Security 
Council and the two sponsors of the peace process in particular 
to work to stop the Israeli aggression and save the peace 
process.

<F P=106> [Sawsan Abu-Husayn report: "Al-Shar' Tells AL-SHARQ </F>
AL-AWSAT: We Will Not Resume Negotiations Before Full 
Withdrawal Is Agreed To"] 
  [Text] Cairo -- Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' has 
said that his country will not resume its negotiations with 
Israel before receiving its final reply vis-a-vis the full 
withdrawal to the 4 June 1967 lines. In an exclusive statement 
to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT he said: "Then we would be able to discuss 
any Israeli proposal." 
  On his country's acceptance of a phased Israeli withdrawal 
within a reasonable period, the Syrian foreign minister said 
that his country "is not at present looking for a phased 
withdrawal or its duration. We are awaiting U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher's visit to the region, especially as he 
has promised to achieve positive results during his upcoming 
tour." 
  Al-Shar' said: "Israel still has not announced its 
willingness to withdraw fully from the Golan, while we accept a 
phased Israeli withdrawal, but the question is: Is it all the 
Golan or are there other areas which Israel believes subject to 
the security clauses?" 
  On Arab coordination al-Shar' said: "We are committed to it. 
We made contacts with Jordan before the Jordanian monarch, King 
Husayn, visited Damascus. And Lebanese President Ilyas 
al-Hirawi and his prime minister held a meeting with President 
Hafiz al-Asad. We also coordinate with Egypt from time to time 
by telephone or through frequent meetings. All this falls 
within the framework of assessing the situation and the extent 
of Israel's seriousness in entering into a comprehensive, full, 
and nondeficient peace with the Arab states." 
  Al-Shar' denied any plan to meet with Faruq Qaddumi in Syria 
within days in the framework of Palestinian-Syrian coordination. 
  On Syria's mediation role between Egypt and Iran he said: 
"Neither party has entrusted us with that matter. As for our 
relations with Iran, they are extremely good and proceeding on 
parallel lines vis-a-vis the important issues in the region."

<F P=106> [Report by Sana' al-Imam from Damascus] </F>
  [Text] Damascus today reiterated the Lebanese resistance's 
right to defend its territory. Informed Syrian sources 
reasserted to Radio Monte Carlo the Lebanese resistance's right 
-- in all its forms -- to defend its territory inside the 
occupied strip, pointing out that no one can stop the resistance 
as long as its cause remains, namely, the Israeli occupation. 
  The Syrian sources said Israel is trying to exploit the 
presence of the resistance to win international sympathy toward 
its security, whereas Lebanese security is being violated as a 
result of Israel's repeated attacks that target Lebanese 
territory. 
  Syrian political sources accused Israel of trying to foil 
U.S. efforts in the peace process, now that the U.S. sponsor 
better understands the Syrian position following the Geneva 
summit. 
  The sources told Radio Monte Carlo that Israel is even 
trying 
to cast doubt on the optimism recently spread by the United 
States. The political sources demanded that the U.S. sponsor 
play a more effective role in influencing Israel's decisions. 
  AL-BA'TH's editorial yesterday said that the role of the 
mailman played by Christopher in his tour and contacts in the 
capitals of the region will not do the peace process any good. 
The official newspaper said it is unacceptable that the role of 
the mailman should continue to govern the mission of U.S. 
envoys, led by the chief of U.S. diplomacy. 
  AL-BA'TH said Syria has remained committed to the peace 
process, but it rejects dictating conditions and does not accept 
blackmail and offering rewards for the aggressor.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] In its editorial today, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH 
writes on Israel's premeditated intentions, aggressions, and 
piracy against Lebanon. It says that the objectives of these 
actions are obvious, and will only bolster Lebanon's national 
unity and its rejection of any concessions regarding the 
resistance or the peace process. 
  In a comment today, the paper writes on Israel's hostile 
intentions and actions. It says: All analysts, particularly 
the international analysts, agree that Israel's aggressions, 
particularly against the Arab sides participating in the peace 
process, which adhere to that process, clearly prove that Israel 
has premeditated intentions to destroy the available opportunity 
to achieve peace. 
  The newspaper TISHRIN writes on the massacre Israel has 
perpetrated in the city of Ba'labakk. It stresses that this 
massacre dealt a great blow to the peace process, and that its 
timing makes it obvious that it was a stab in the back of the 
United States' efforts to save the peace process from the 
stalemate caused by the Israeli rejection of the pillars of a 
just and comprehensive peace. 
  TISHRIN says: By escalating its aggressive and brutal acts, 
and declaring a continuous war against Lebanon, Israel is trying 
to direct its missiles, guns, and bombers to assassinate the 
peace process this time, after it has failed to derail this 
process from the set objectives confirmed in documents and 
pledges. 
  TISHRIN stresses: There is no doubt that the abortion of the 
peace process by escalating the situation, launching devastating 
Israeli wars, kidnapping resistance men, and killing innocent 
people, necessitate that the international community link its 
words with deeds, pressuring Israel to stop this aggressive, 
brutal policy, and to respond to the pillars of a just and 
comprehensive peace. 
  TISHRIN notes: In light of the Israeli attempts and the 
Israeli occupation forces' brutal actions to torpedo the peace 
process, the United States, which stressed the need to continue 
its efforts, and said that its role has not been exhausted, must 
now, before anyone else, hasten to save this process from the 
Israeli shelling and to prevent its destruction. This can only 
be achieved by deterring the Israeli Government and curbing its 
provocative practices.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: Israel was not content with the savage 
massacre it committed against the Lebanese citizens in the 
western al-Biqa'. It has escalated its attacks on southern 
Lebanese villages and townships, and massed additional military 
forces and heavy weapons. Israeli officials have made a series 
of threats to commit more acts of aggression. 
  Even the most naive of observers can see that beyond what 
Israel gained from the Gaza-Jericho agreement -- direct Israeli 
hegemony and real Israeli trusteeship over the Palestinian 
people's resources -- Israel wants to deal a final blow to both 
the U.S. peace initiative and the peace process based on the 
Madrid conference. 
  As usual, Israel chose Lebanon, in its capacity as the 
weakest link in the Arab body, to remove every vestige of the 
atmosphere of peace from the region, replacing it with an 
atmosphere of war. Only a few days ago, the Israeli prime 
minister clearly announced that he sees no benefit in a new tour 
of good offices in the Middle East by the U.S. secretary of 
state to promote the peace process on the Syrian track, because 
Israel does not intend to withdraw from the Golan, while Syria 
links peace to this withdrawal. 
  In fact, Rabin's statement is a flagrant call on the United 
States to forget its peace initiative and relinquish its 
commitments to achieving a just and comprehensive peace on all 
fronts of the conflict, based on Security Council Resolutions 
242 and 338 and the land-for-peace principle. 
  This is not the first serious Israeli attempt to undermine 
the peace process. At a similar time last year, Israel sent 
large forces into occupied southern Lebanon and used various 
kinds of weapons to systematically destroy hundreds of Lebanese 
villages. At that time, Yitzhaq Rabin announced he wanted to 
create a new refugee problem in the region. Indeed, hundreds of 
thousands of Lebanese civilians were evicted. If the United 
States, through Secretary Christopher, had not quickly salvaged 
its regional initiative, and if Lebanon and Syria had not 
responded to the U.S. endeavors, the peace process would have 
been a memory from the past. 
  Now, Rabin is doing it again. He has publicly announced he 
will not withdraw from the Golan or southern Lebanon and that he 
will commit large-scale acts of aggression on the pretext of 
protecting Israel's security. Meanwhile, the Lebanese people 
are the ones who are being buried under the rubble of destroyed 
buildings in savage Zionist raids. 
  Peace can be achieved only by deeds. Israel's deeds, 
however, flagrantly conflict with the simplest fundamentals and 
principles of peace. The substance of both the U.S. initiative 
and the Security Council resolutions is to exchange land for 
peace. Israel, however, refuses to return the land. 
  If the U.S. initiative aims to spread a climate of detente 
and calm in the region that will help parties engage in genuine 
peace talks, then Israel is beating the drums of war and 
translating its words into action, using its aircraft to attack 
defenseless Lebanese areas, and ceaselessly shelling, from land 
and sea, the villages and towns of southern Lebanon. 
  Where is Israel today after the Washington initiative? Where 
is Israel after the Madrid Conference and its clear, well-known 
principles? Have the Lebanese-Israeli talks taken a single step 
forward? Have the Syrian-Israeli talks taken a single step 
forward, knowing that Syria is the key to peace in the Middle 
East? 
  By involving the Palestinian side in an unfair separate 
agreement, by deceiving the Palestinian side in order to keep 
Jerusalem out of the agreement and to maintain the Israeli 
occupation, and by waving material temptations at this deceived 
side, although they were soon to be discovered to be a big lie 
-- by doing all that, Rabin thought he had won a big prize and 
could, consequently, undermine the entire peace process, 
particularly on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks. He ignores the 
fact that peace is made by peoples, not individuals, and that 
peace is strengthened when it is based on principles of justice, 
right and UN charters. He also ignores the fact that an 
illusionary peace will inevitably collapse in the face of the 
people's strikes and struggle for the sake of their usurped 
rights and occupied lands. Hence, we can see his attacks on 
Lebanon and his flagrant avoidance of the requirements of the 
peace process on the Syrian track, that is, complete and 
comprehensive withdrawal from the Golan Heights. 
  This Israeli subversion damages the U.S. peace initiative, 
the United States' credibility and its commitments, as well as 
the efforts of the world community. It will inevitably lead to 
a great failure for U.S. policy in the Middle East. The United 
States, Russia, and other parties in the world community have a 
rare opportunity to return things to their proper order and to 
revive the peace efforts. This can be done by denouncing 
Israel's aggression, in a clear and decisive way, especially 
because Lebanon has made an urgent protest to the UN Security 
Council. Naturally, denunciation alone is not sufficient. 
Deeds must accompany words. Israel must be asked to precisely 
implement the UN Security Council resolutions and withdraw from 
all Arab territories. 
  Syria will always support Lebanon. Israel's threats and 
actions will have no influence whatsoever on the two countries' 
determination to regain their occupied territories in full, 
regardless of sacrifices.

Damascus today on a visit to Syria that will last for several 
days. He was received at Damascus International Airport by 
Rislan 'Allush, the assistant foreign minister, a number of 
Foreign Ministry officials, and the PRC ambassador in Damascus 
and embassy staff. 
  In a statement to the SANA correspondent, Tian Zengpei 
expressed his extreme happiness at visiting Syria and said: 
China and Syria are two friendly countries whose peoples are 
tied by traditional friendship. Over the past 38 years of 
diplomatic relations between our two countries, our friendship 
and cooperation witnessed satisfactory progress based on the 
five principles of peaceful coexistence. Our two countries 
continued to exchange sympathy and support on the international 
arena, holding close or identical views on many important 
international issues. 
  The Chinese official said: Increasing visits and 
consultations between our two countries in this age, which is 
characterized by a changing international climate, assumes great 
importance for increasing understanding and strengthening 
friendship. I am looking forward to meeting with the Syrian 
officials concerned to exchange views on international and 
regional issues of common concern and to look for ways of 
developing bilateral relations. I will witness the great 
achievements realized by the Syrian people under the leadership 
of President Hafiz al-Asad in the field of expanding national 
production and developing the country. 
  Concluding his statement, Tian Zengpei said: I am certain 
that this visit of mine will contribute toward further 
increasing and strengthening ties of cooperation and friendship 
between our two countries.

  [Text] The user trial of India's surface-to-surface 
missile Prithvi [Earth] commenced today. The launch began at 
the interim test range at Chandipur-on-Sea in Orissa at 1144 
hours [0614 GMT] today. The first launch in the series fully 
met the mission's requirements. Our correspondent Rizwana 
Akhtar who witnessed the launch reports: 
  [Begin Rizwana Akhtar recording] Prithvi, India's 
surface-to-surface short-range missile, was successfully 
launched from the interim test range at Chandipur this morning. 
The missile executed a perfect takeoff at 1140 hours [as heard] 
soaring into the clear blue sky followed by a trail of fire and 
smoke. The missile was clearly visible to the naked eye for a 
short time before disappearing. In the morning when countdown 
began, there was an air of expectation and people clamored to 
get a vantage position to witness the launch. The tense 
atmosphere was broken by a surge of spontaneous applause. 
Scientists of the DRDO [Defense Research and Development 
Organization] who have helped develop the missile and officials 
monitoring the launch were jubilant at the success and were seen 
congratulating each other. The silver-white Prithvi with red 
stripes is smaller in size and dimension than the Agni [Fire] 
missile. But the sense of achievement of mission accomplished 
was greater than any I have seen before. [end recording]

  [Text] In Kashmir, a second attempt was made on the life 
of the banned JKLF [Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front] 
president, Mr. Yasin Malik, in Srinagar today when he was 
leading a processing to the Idgah graveyard. One of his 
associates died and several were injured when extremists 
showered bullets on them at Kankahi Mohallah. After the 
incident, Mr. Malik was whisked away to a safe place by his 
supporters. Later, he told a press conference that his 
attackers belong to the pro-Pakistan extremist outfit, the 
Hezbul Mojahedin. Yesterday, Mr. Malik had a narrow escape when 
the Hezbul Mojahedin tried to kidnap him from a hospital, but 
his supporters foiled the attempt. 
  [Hong Kong AFP in English 1618 GMT 3 Jun 94, in a 
Srinagar-datelined report, adds the following: "A pro-Pakistani 
Moslem rebel group Friday denied trying to kill a rival 
separatist leader after dragging him out of hospital and later 
firing on a march organised by him in this Kashmir summer 
capital. 
  "The Hizbul Mujahideen group said the Thursday attempt on 
the 
life of Yasin Malik, the leader of the powerful Jammu and 
Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF), and the attack on a rally a day 
later, were staged by disgruntled JKLF members. 
  "`Lobbyism in the JKLF was responsible for the attacks,' a 
trenchant Hizbul Mujahideen statement said. `JKLF workers tried 
to kill Yasin Malik on Thursday and Friday.' 
  "Hizb spokesman Mohammed Sadiq said Malik's charges were 
baseless and an attempt to gain public sympathy and coverage in 
the media. 
  "`It is a ploy,' he said, referring to Malik's allegations 
that Hizbul Mujahideen activists had again targeted him Friday 
during an attack on a procession which killed at least two 
militants and injured four. 
  "`If it is proved that Hizbul men were involved, we will try 
them,' Sadiq added. 
  "Malik, who advocates an independent Kashmir unlike most 
other groups who want the state to accede to Pakistan, announced 
a three-day strike from Saturday to protest the attack by `black 
sheep and criminals.' 
  "He also announced a fast until the 70-odd warring militant 
outfits reorganised themselves under three heads: those 
favouring independence for Kashmir, those wanting to join 
Pakistan, and a third `general category.'"]

AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: Final Gulf Position on Yemen To Be Defined

  [Text] Cairo -- Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Shaykh Sabah 
al-Ahmad has said in a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the 
Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] foreign ministers' meeting 
scheduled to be held in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia next week 
will define the final position on the Yemeni war, especially as 
the Gulf states have monitored the position of both the north 
and the south and the contacts made between the two sides, and 
in view of the adoption of the Security Council resolution. He 
stressed that all efforts should be aimed first at securing a 
cease-fire. 
  Asked about the possibility of restoring Kuwaiti-Iraqi 
relations if Iraqi President Saddam Husayn announces in a clear 
statement that Kuwait is a free independent state which Iraqi 
has nothing to do with, the Kuwaiti foreign minister said: The 
Iraqi president must announce that and register this recognition 
in the Security Council and the United Nations first. Because 
there are no relations between the two countries at the 
bilateral level. And there are Security Council resolutions 
which Iraq must comply with and implement first. On lifting the 
embargo in Iraq and the Security Council's remarks in this 
connection, he said: We have nothing to do with that issue, and 
the council must decide what it deems right in accordance with 
the resolution adopted by it. On Arab reconciliation he said 
that it still needs time, especially in view of the current 
deteriorating Arab conditions, as the region is full of problems 
and disputes which should be resolved first.

afternoon of Monday -- the third day of 'id al-Adha, which led 
to some deaths as stated in the two successive statements made 
by an official Saudi source -- the second of which included all 
details, figures, nationalities and names of the identified 
dead-persons. 
  King Fahd said he gave directives, in this connection, to 
form specialized committees to study these incidents and find 
solutions and suggestions to avoid such rare incidents of the 
overcrowding. 
  Al-Sha'ir said the monarch listened to some of the views of 
the concerned ministers and renewed his thanks and appreciation 
for the sincere, successful efforts exerted by officials and 
citizens to extend the best services to the pilgrims. 
  King Fahd stressed that the state will continue to exert 
efforts to reach the best methods of providing the highest 
standard of services every year, including the establishment of 
many roads, bridges, doubling means of transports, and 
communications as well as the administrative services extended 
by the Ministry of Hajj to pilgrims and visitors of the holy 
places. 
  Then, the custodian of the two holy mosques briefed the 
council on the outcome of his telephone contacts and talks with 
Arab leaders over the past few days, including a message from 
King Hassan II of Morocco conveyed by his special adviser 
Abdulhadi Boutaleb, a message from UAE [United Arab Emirates] 
President Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuyhayyan conveyed by the 
UAE Foreign Minister Rashid Bin-'Abdullah al-Nu'aymi and a 
message from the Amir of Kuwait Shaykh Jabir al-Ahmad al-Sabah 
conveyed by First Deputy Premier and Foreign minister Shaykh 
Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jabir within the context of constant 
consultations between King Fahd and Arab leaders on Arab events. 
  King Fahd also briefed the council on his talks with 
Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Yemeni envoys. 
  Al-Sha'ir said King Fahd also spoke about the most important 
events including the situation in the sisterly Yemen with a 
comprehensive and accurate analysis of issues on the political 
arena, and expressed hope that the fighting would stop and the 
bloodshed would end to resolve the dispute peacefully. 
  Studying some domestic issues, the council decided the 
following: Firstly, approving the delegation of the minister of 
oil and mineral resources to hold talks with the Arabian oil 
company limited to renew the exploration rights contract awarded 
to the company in the submerged area parallel to the area shared 
by the Kingdom and Kuwait, and negotiate the formula of a 
contract for the period following the duration of the current 
contract, taking into account the company's participation in 
marketing oil in Japan and encouraging Japanese investments in 
the Kingdom. 
  Secondly, approving some appointments on the 14th 
administrative grade at the Ministry of Rural and Municipal 
Affairs.

<F P=106> [By Maher Chmaytelli] </F>
  [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 3 (AFP) -- Rival Yemeni army units 
fought an artillery battle near the southern stronghold of Aden 
on Friday [3 June], despite both sides' acceptance of a UN 
Security Council call for a ceasefire. 
  The duel took place around the village of Lahij, around 30 
kilometres (18 miles) north of Aden, a day after troops loyal to 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih edged closer to this port city, a 
correspondent said. 
  Southern anti-aircraft guns in Aden also went into action 
but 
no missile or bomb explosion was heard. 
  Salih's northern forces have mounted "fierce offensives on 
all fronts, destroying villages and killing civilians," charged 
the southern command of the president's rival, 'Ali Salim al-Bid. 
  "We are resisting with all our strength to protect our land 
and our honour," it said. 
  The south also renewed a charge that Iraqi soldiers were 
fighting alongside the northerners. Five Iraqis were captured 
in the oil region of Shabwah, 300 kilometres (180 miles) 
northeast of Aden, it said. 
  Al-Bid's self-declared Yemen Democratic Republic also 
renewed 
its acceptance of Security Council Resolution 924 calling for a 
ceasefire in the month-long civil war. 
  The north on Thursday also said it was prepared to halt the 
fighting and implement the resolution, as several dozen people 
were killed in battles on all the frontlines around Aden. 
  On the political front, a northern spokesman in Sanaa 
condemned the south's formation of a separate government and 
warned that it could only lead to further bloodshed. 
  "This separatist act aims only to torpedo the efforts 
underway to restore security and security in our nation in line 
with Security Council 924," the spokesman said. 
  "This band of secessionists has shown once more that it is 
determined to pursue the bloodshed to impose secession by 
force," he charged. 
  The south on Thursday formed a cabinet headed by Haydar 
Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, appointed prime minister of the breakaway 
state, a day after the Security Council resolution. 
  A senior northern official, meanwhile, welcomed the 
appointment of Lakhdar Brahimi as UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali's special envoy to Yemen. 
  Brahimi is a "respected Arab figure and capable of carrying 
out this mission," 'Abd-'al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, a member of the 
presidential council, said in an interview with the Qatari news 
agency QNA. 
  Under the ceasefire mission, the former Algerian foreign 
minister is in charge of a UN fact-finding mission to Yemen. 
  Egyptian President Husni Mubarak telephoned both Salih and 
al-Bid asking them to call a halt to the fighting, Cairo Radio 
reported Friday. 
  He called them late Thursday and urged them to withdraw 
their 
forces from the combat zones as a first step towards resolving 
the crisis. 
  Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad also called the Yemeni rivals 
on Thursday urging them to settle their differences.

<F P=106> [By Laurence Peter] </F>
  [Text] Sanaa, June 3 (AFP) -- Troops loyal to Yemeni 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih are in a position to capture the 
southern bastion of Aden but are awaiting the political go-ahead 
from Sanaa, a northern minister said Friday [3 June]. 
  Information Minister Hasan al-Lawzi said the "legitimate" 
forces advancing on the port city from the north and east were 
now "able to enter the city, but they are awaiting a political 
decision." 
  "We don't want to go into Aden for many reasons," he added. 
  The north has said it wanted to avoid civilian casualties in 
the city of more than 500,000 people. 
  The government in Sanaa is also waiting for a UN 
fact-finding 
mission to visit the country before entering formal negotiations 
to end the month-long civil war, al-Lawzi told reporters. 
  "We are waiting for the fact-finding mission, then we'll 
decide who we can talk to," the minister said. 
  The government has said it was ready to respond positively 
to 
a UN Security Council resolution adopted Wednesday calling for 
an immediate ceasefire and the sending of a fact-finding mission 
to Yemen. 
  The president's northern forces have been fighting those of 
southern leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid since May 5. 
  The north charged on Friday as artillery duels raged near 
Aden that al-Bid's followers had violated the UN resolution by 
announcing a separate government the previous day. 
  Al-Lawzi said Sanaa did not need to hold negotiations with 
al- Bid's Yemen Socialist Party (YSP) before implementing a 
ceasefire. 
  The government has been holding informal contacts with 
pro-unity members of the YSP, but has ruled out dialogue with 
al-Bid and his followers. 
  "The problem is on the other side, as they believe they will 
achieve their goals by fighting. They think continued fighting 
will lead to recognition" of their declaration of a separate 
state in the south, al-Lawzi said. 
  "The separatists insist on violating the UN resolution 
because they are hoping for outside help." 
  But a ceasefire was "possible" because Salih's forces 
controlled most governorates, apart from Aden, he said. 
  The minister denied southern allegations that Iraqi troops 
were fighting alongside the northern forces. 
  "The army is still able to do whatever the government wants. 
The other side makes such accusations in the hope of getting 
foreign support," he countered.

  [Excerpt] Aden, June 3 (AFP) -- Northern Yemeni forces 
fought their way closer to the south's bastion of Aden on Friday 
[3 June] after trading rocket and artillery fire with southern 
troops, despite both sides' acceptance of a UN ceasefire call. 
  Northern army units loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
moved to within 15 kilometers (nine miles) of Aden, as a 
northern minister said they were now in a position to capture 
the city after four weeks of civil war. 
  Salih's troops captured the villages of al-Waht, 20 
kilometers (12 miles) northwest of Aden, and Lahij, 30 
kilometers (19 miles) north of the city, southern commanders 
confirmed. 
  Dozens of people were killed in the battle for the two 
villages on Thursday and Friday, and hundreds of villagers fled 
the fighting. 
  Southern troops loyal to the president's rival 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid said they were forced back to Bi'r Nasir, some 15 
kilometers (nine miles) north of Aden. 
  Northern troops advancing on Aden from the east also moved 
forward to within 30 kilometers (19 miles) of the port city 
after fighting in the Abyan region. 
  Two surface-to-surface missiles were fired at Aden in a dawn 
attack Friday, without causing casualties. 
  A military spokesman in Aden, capital of a breakaway 
southern 
state, said southern anti-aircraft fire intercepted one missile 
while the other landed in an uninhabited area of desert. 
  In Sanaa, Information Minister Hasan al-Lawzi told reporters 
that northern forces were now "able to enter the city, but they 
are awaiting a political decision." 
  Salih's troops have mounted "fierce offensives on all 
fronts, 
destroying villages and killing civilians," the southern command 
charged in a statement. "We are resisting with all our strength 
to protect our land and our honour." 
  A military spokesman in Aden said southern forces on 
Thursday 
repelled an offensive by northern troops in the oil region of 
Shabwah, 300 kilometers (180 miles) northeast of Aden. 
  The spokesman told Aden Radio that the northern troops 
commander in Shabwah, Colonel Muhammad Salim al-'Arif, lost his 
right arm in the fighting, while "several" northern soldiers 
were killed or injured. 
  Southern army units destroyed four tanks and three troop 
carriers and captured two tanks and several northern army 
vehicles, the spokesman added. [passage omitted]

  [Text] A responsible source at the Armed Forces Command has 
told the Yemeni news agency in Aden that a few hours after the 
issuance of the resolution of the UN Security Council calling 
for an immediate cease-fire, a development welcomed by our 
country which declared that it will fully observe all its points 
and will welcome the dispatch of the investigating committee 
formed for this purpose, the forces of the ruling military 
regime in Sanaa today launched a number of surface-to-surface 
missiles on the capital, Aden. These missiles were intercepted 
by our air defenses. Fragments of one of the missiles fell on 
one of Aden's mosques where worshipers were engaged in dawn 
prayers. A number of them were seriously injured and were 
subsequently taken to the hospital for treatment. Later a 
number of Arab, foreign, and local correspondents gathered at 
the scene as eyewitnesses to this [word indistinct] incident.

  [Text] Sanaa, June 2 (AFP) -- Northern Yemeni troops fired 
missiles and artillery shells at a Palestinian camp on Thursday 
[2 June] in Dar Sa'd, north of the southern stronghold Aden, 
Palestinian sources said here. 
  Thirty Palestinian families were evacuated from the camp to 
Aden, the sources said, but it was not known whether anybody was 
killed or injured in the attack. 
  Several Palestinian camps are situated in Yemen. The attack 
came as gun battles raged around Aden on Thursday despite a UN 
resolution Wednesday for a cease-fire in the civil war which 
broke out on May 5. 
  At least six civilians were injured during northern air 
raids 
on Aden Thursday, a southern military source said.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by "a responsible source at the Defense </F>
Ministry in the Democratic Republic of Yemen"; date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Since dawn today, the enemy has 
been launching aggressive, indiscriminate attacks using 
artillery, missiles, and aircraft on residential areas, 
government buildings, civil installations and schools. This is 
part of the hysterical and adventurist behavior on the part of 
the head of the military regime in Sanaa. Our air, naval, and 
ground forces resisted these aggressive attacks with rare 
heroism on all fronts, striking deadly blows on the invading 
enemy forces, whose operations today resembled the fighting of 
remnants, thieves, and infiltrators. Our forces inflicted on 
them heavy human and material losses. On the Abyan axis, eight 
enemy tanks were destroyed while two others were captured. On 
the Tawr-al-Baha-al-Khattabiyyah axis, 10 enemy tanks were 
destroyed, with three other tanks captured. Four (BNB) armored 
cars and two Katyusha rocket-launching vehicles were also 
destroyed. On the Kharaz-al-Mandeb axis, five enemy tanks were 
captured and three others captured. One enemy aircraft was shot 
down. On all these fronts, the enemy forces retreated to their 
rear positions leaving behind hundreds of dead and wounded. 
  Many of the officers and men of the attacking forces have 
surrendered. In the Shabwah Governorate, the enemy forces 
attempted to repeat their attacks, but our Armed Forces and the 
masses of the people resisted, striking crushing blows against 
them. We shall bring you more information in a subsequent 
communique about the front in the Shabwah Governorate.

  [Text] A responsible source has reacted to the 
secessionist rebels' step to form a secessionist government in 
Aden. He said: This secessionist act, which ignores 
constitutional legitimacy, aims only to obstruct the efforts 
exerted to achieve security and stability in our country in 
light of UN Security Council Resolution 924. 
  The source added: The step taken by the secessionists, who 
have rebelled against constitutional legitimacy, reminds us of 
another step taken by the secessionist gang, which rebelled 
against legitimacy and democracy when the three-day cease-fire 
decision was issued on 21 May 1994 in response to a desire 
expressed by the custodian of the two holy places, King Fahd 
Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz of fraternal Saudi Arabia. Then, 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid shocked the world by announcing the secession despite his 
knowledge of the good efforts exerted by the custodian of the 
two holy places in the hope that his desire, to which our 
political leadership responded favorably, would be a prelude to 
a permanent cessation of fighting and a solution to the disputes 
through constructive dialogue. 
  The source added that this secessionist gang has confirmed 
once again that it insists on shedding the blood of the Yemeni 
people in order to impose secession through force of arms. 
  The source concluded by saying: The government of the 
Republic of Yemen considers this illegitimate step a blatant 
challenge to the UN Security Council and a flagrant violation of 
Resolution 924. Despite this fact, this flagrant violation of 
the UN Security Council will not deter the government of the 
Republic of Yemen from dealing with that resolution in a 
positive spirit and in manner that will lead to implementing it 
in a comprehensive way by all those concerned.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Clinton's Visit To Italy"] </F>
  [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton, Thursday midnight, 2 
June, arrived in Rome to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 
D-Day, the allied forces' landing in the Normandy during the 
second world war. The trip to Rome is the first phase of the 
U.S. President's one-week tour of Europe. 
  During his symbolic stay in Italy he is due to meet with the 
Italian leaders, including Prime Minister Berlusconi and Pope 
John Paul II, the leader of the world's Catholics, in Vatican. 
Informed politicians say Clinton is considering two issue in 
the visit. One is to establish closer economic and political 
relations with the present rulers in Italy. And the other is to 
reinforce the significance of the American role in the existence 
of contemporary Europe as well as propagating U.S. capability in 
aiding the European countries in solving their problems. 
  Informed politicians believe that at the time when the 
presence of neofascists in the Italian cabinet has caused 
worries, the U.S. is trying to persuade the EU [European Union] 
members, excluding Italy, that it would be able to control Italy 
and keep away the danger of neofascists. This way, giving a 
bigger role to America in Europe will be propagated. 
  After the end of the cold war era, with the potential danger 
of Soviet Union dying away, the EU member states, especially 
France and Germany, have regulated the policies based on the 
expansion of economic and trade cooperation among the European 
states. They have, however, paid little attention to the 
interests of the countries on the other side of the Atlantic. 
It seems that the continuation of such policies will undermine 
the role of the U.S. in dealing with the issue. 
  Presently the U.S. is involved in a trade war with Japan and 
to isolate that country the U.S. seriously needs the backing of 
the European countries. In fact another objective of Clinton's 
visit to Rome, and later on to London and Paris, is to bring 
about coordination among the Group-7 states. But whether 
Clinton would be able to have the support of the European 
countries of Group-7 to confront the trade policies of Japan 
will depend on the outcome of his meetings with the leaders of 
France and Britain.

  [Text] A responsible source has categorically denied that 
any Arab party is participating in the military operations waged 
by the forces of legitimacy against rebellious secessionists. 
The source described the reports disseminated by the 
secessionist gang that Iraqis are participating in the fighting 
as false, fabricated, and misleading allegations. This gang has 
repeated such fabrications and lies to mislead public opinion 
and gain some Arab and international parties' sympathy, said the 
source. 
  The responsible source added: It is not new to see this gang 
repeating such false allegations on the presence of Iraqis or 
others. Yesterday, the television, which is controlled by this 
gang, showed Sudanese nurse Salah Muhammad Fadlallah and claimed 
that he is a pilot fighting at the side of the forces of unity 
and legitimacy. This allegation was exposed when the gang 
presented the documents of this person who was kidnapped by the 
members of this gang from his work site in one of the medical 
centers in the Lahij Governorate. This person, who has been 
working as a nurse in Yemen for the past five years, was shown 
on the television as a pilot.

  [Text] One of the senior diplomats at the British Embassy 
in Tehran has been given one month to leave Iran. The action 
has been taken by the Iranian Foreign Ministry after it was 
discovered that the British diplomat was involved in activities 
incompatible with the diplomatic norms. The said diplomat was 
under surveillance for quite some time, but his expulsion orders 
came in what can be termed as a retaliatory measure. 
  The British foreign office minister, Mr. Douglas Hogg, who 
still thinks he is living in the British Empire era, has become 
angry over Tehran's retaliatory measure and has made certain 
remarks that reflect his wrath. The irresponsible remarks made 
by Mr. Hogg on Wednesday indicate the fact that London still 
wants to live with its past dreams. Mr. Hogg does not accept 
the fact that the Islamic Republic of Iran is an independent 
country whose foreign policy is based on the principle of 
protecting the interests of the Muslim world as well as the 
national interests of Islamic Iran. 
  However, the expression of such illogical remarks by British 
officials is not something new, and once again the straining of 
the Tehran-London ties is also not something that has happened 
recently. Mr. Hogg is well aware of the fact that, contrary to 
all diplomatic norms, the intelligence agents of his government 
had planted bugging devices inside the embassy of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran in London. But, instead of tendering an 
apology to the Iranian Government, Mr. Hogg has made 
controversial remarks. 
  The British, who always practice the policy of divide and 
rule, and ruled the world for centuries on the basis of the same 
policy, know how much the Muslim world hates the policies of the 
British Governments. The installing of the aggressive Israeli 
regime has been carried out directly by Britain. Its policies 
and activities in Bosnia-Herzegovina today are wholly 
anti-Islamic and the British forces in Bosnia and the former 
Yugoslavia are inflicting blows on Islam and the Muslims. 
  The London government is sinking in the quagmire of domestic 
problems these days and Mr. John Major's government is 
witnessing the gradual demise of the British Government. 
Rampant unemployment has turned the country into a big house of 
the beggars. 
  We advise Mr. Douglas Hogg that, instead of creating such a 
negative climate and making such irresponsible remarks, he 
should officially tender an apology to the Islamic Republic of 
Iran's Government for the illegal activities of the British 
diplomat in Tehran and for the illegal act of his government in 
bugging the Iranian embassy, which is against all diplomatic 
norms. 
  Mr. Hogg should also accept the reality that the golden era 
of London's domination in the Middle East is long over.

  [Text] Vienna, June 2, IRNA -- The latest British 
allegations against Iran are a clear indication of the 
Conservative Party's desperate attempts to distract public 
opinion from its pro-aggression and corrupt nature. 
  The international community should bear in mind the support 
Khmer Rouge and Saddam Husayn got from successive British 
governments, therefore, it should not come as a surprise to find 
out that the Serbs are also included in the list of British 
allies regardless of their atrocities against humanity. 
  One used to believe that the British politicians were more 
clever than accusing Iran of forging foreign policy documents 
already known to the public. 
  British allies, led by the United States, could only hope 
now 
that London government will come up with something more concrete 
and convincing against Iran next time. 
  Keeping in mind the level of British politicians' 
intelligence, as witnessed recently, the world has to wait for 
quite a long time to hear a single convincing argument against 
Iran from the British side.

  [Text] London, June 2, IRNA -- Foreign Secretary Douglas 
Hurd, has upped the stakes in Britain's diplomatic row with Iran 
by making fresh allegations that Tehran supposedly "practices 
state terrorism." 
  The new accusations, made in an interview with BBC World 
Service Wednesday night, follows comments from Foreign Office 
Minister Douglas Hogg, falsely describing Iran as a "factor of 
instability in the region" during a visit to Qatar. 
  Both remarks are uncharacteristic of the norms of diplomatic 
protocol that supposed to be based upon mutual respect and are 
seen jeopardizing the already strained relations between the two 
countries after the reciprocal expulsion of senior diplomats. 
  In his interview, Hurd claimed that the expulsions, started 
by Britain last Thursday, were "not a game," but believed that 
it was up to Iran, and not Britain, to ensure that the 
tit-for-tat exchanges did not continue. 
  The sting in his remarks was in resorting to old allegations 
about Iran's "supposed involvement in terrorism", which have not 
been heard from a British minister since Tehran severed 
relations with London in 1989. 
  The foreign secretary cited the Rushdie affair and 
orchestrated smears about Iran's links with the IRA to maintain 
that it was Tehran, and not London, that should change its 
behavior before there could be "decent relations" between the 
two countries. 
  But he made no mention of the `forged documents' issued 
earlier in the day by the Foreign Office that apparently 
hoodwinked no one into believing its claim of Iran's involvement 
in discrediting Britain's already discredited policy in Bosnia. 
  The documents disclosed are two among many floating around 
over the past year and are so ludicrously written that it is an 
insult to even the most illiterate to suggest they were produced 
by "Iran's intelligence service", as claimed by the Foreign 
Office. 
  Even more incredible were the conflicting statements put out 
by the Foreign Office, which came after maintaining last week 
that its excuse for expelling an Iranian first secretary would 
remain confidential because of its apparent childish nature. 
  Hurd's tact in his interview was to claim that it was now 
impossible to go on "excusing inexcusable behavior." But behind 
his words, the question left open as to who was trying to 
convince whom about who in stooping so low to worsen the 
diplomatic row. 
  The sudden change of events in Britain's relations with Iran 
can be traced to the U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher's visit to London on April 25, when he was reported 
to have asked for further UK support in Washington's campaign to 
isolate Iran. 
  With Hurd due to meet Christopher in Oxford this Saturday, 
it 
is presumed that he can be briefed about subsequent campaign 
that was launched with the smears about the IRA [Irish 
Republican Army] links only four days after his visit. 
  But still left to be answered by the British Government is 
the earlier embarrassing discovery of an intelligence service 
bug in the Iranian Embassy, which the succession of UK insults 
have been trying to camouflage. 
  Indications are that Britain's increasingly erratic and 
often 
eccentric foreign policy is the result of a power-struggle, 
where hardline anti-Iran opinion currently has the upperhand to 
produce unpalatable behavior reminiscent of its colonial past.

The brother president praised the brothers in Sudan, led by 
brother Lt. Gen. 'Umar Hasan al-Bashir, for their support for 
our people and Yemen's unity, calling it a national and pan-Arab 
gain for all the sons of the Arab nation. 
  The brother president referred to current developments in 
our 
country and the challenges traitor agent al-Bid has imposed on 
the homeland and its unity by triggering sedition and infighting 
among the sons of the one homeland. He stressed that our Yemeni 
people will stick to their will and unity. 
  The president asked the Sudanese culture and information 
minister to convey his greetings to his brother Lit. Gen. 'Umar 
Hasan al- Bashir, as well as his wishes for progress and 
prosperity for the Sudanese people. The meeting was attended by 
Information Minister Hasan al-Lawzi.

  [Text] Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, speaker of 
the House of Representatives, has sent a letter to the chairman 
of the current session of the Afro-Arab parliamentary dialogue 
conference, in which he regretted the Yemeni House of 
Representatives' inability to take part in the conference. He 
said this is a result of the situation in our country since the 
eruption of the political crisis in August and a result of the 
military situation exploded by the secessionist clique within 
the Socialist Party, as well as al-Bid's secessionist 
declaration that has no foundation in the Constitution or the 
law, since the Yemeni Republic is an indivisible whole and no 
part of it may be relinquished. 
  The letter asked the conference to voice support for Yemen's 
unity and constitutional authority that was elected by the 
people.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Iran Arrests Two Iraqis on Charges </F>
of Planning To Carry Out Terrorist Operations"] 
  [Text] Tehran, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Iranian 
authorities have arrested two senior officers from the Iraqi 
intelligence service on charges of "planning to carry out 
large-scale terrorist operations." Intelligence [and Security] 
Minister 'Ali Fallahian named the two officers as Ra'd Mustafa 
Fattah and Arkan 'Abd-al-Amir 'Ali, who both, according to 
Fallahian, "confessed." Tehran described the two officers as 
members of the special branch -- an intelligence organ run by 
Iraqi President Saddam Husayn. 
  Four Iranians have also been arrested. It has been said that 
they worked with the two Iraqis in a special operations squad. 
  Fallahian's announcement yesterday came as a surprise to 
analysts, who had predicted an improvement in relations between 
the two neighboring countries. Especially as Iranian Foreign 
Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati is scheduled to visit Baghdad on 11 
June. He will be the first Iranian minister to visit Baghdad 
since the mullahs seized power in 1979. More importantly, 
Velayati, who is in Cairo to attend the Nonaligned Movement 
conference, met yesterday with Iraqi Foreign Minister Muhammad 
Sa'id al-Sahhaf. 
  Fallahian said that the two Iraqis "signed a full 
confession" 
after a protracted investigation with them. He did not say 
where the two alleged agents had been arrested exactly or who 
interrogated them. 
  Iranian authorities seized from the two Iraqi officers a 
number of "sophisticated equipment," an undisclosed sum of money 
in counterfeit foreign and Iranian currency, and a certain 
quantity of arms and explosives. 
  The security minister, who is close to "Supreme Guide" 'Ali 
Khamene'i, said that the two Iraqis are responsible for 22 bomb 
explosions in several parts of the country over the past four 
months. And that 14 other bombs had been discovered and defused 
by Iranian security services. 
  Sources said later that the two Iraqis had planned to carry 
out a series of bombings in Tehran to obstruct the celebrations 
marking the fifth anniversary of the death of Khomeyni -- the 
mullah who set up the clerics' rule in Iran. 
  A group of Iranian exiles based in Baghdad threatened to 
obstruct the celebrations when Revolutionary Guard units began 
to bring thousands of people from the countryside to organize a 
huge gathering on 15 June around Khomeyni's tomb in south Tehran. 
  It is clear that Velayati's visit to Baghdad still stands. 
The two sides need one another in their joint endeavor to 
destroy the Kurdish "safe haven" in north Iraq. The two 
countries are also hoping to set up an axis opposed to U.S. 
influence in the region. 
  As is known, Iraq is hosting and sponsoring the largest 
Iranian group in exile, that is Mojahedin-e Khalq.

  [Excerpts] Simultaneous with the fifth anniversary of the 
demise of His Eminence Imam Khomeyni, may he be admitted to 
God's paradise, the religious and political rites of the Friday 
prayers were staged today in Tehran under the leadership of 
Ayatollah Yazdi in the presence of the mourning masses. 
  Addressing the congregation, which embraced a large group of 
mourners and pilgrims from various parts of the country and the 
world to the blessed shrine of His Eminence Imam Khomeyni, 
Ayatollah Yazdi said that taking part in ceremonies marking the 
anniversary of the Imam's demise has become an Islamic ritual. 
[passage omitted] 
  The acting Friday prayer leader of Tehran referred to the 
recent guidelines of his eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, the 
leader of the Islamic revolution, which stated that the nation, 
the government, and the country's officials should refrain from 
doing things which could serve to inspire hope among the 
enemies. 
  Ayatollah Yazdi urged the nation to pay careful attention to 
these guidelines, and said: Those who speak in certain forums 
and gatherings in a very unfair way and away from the norm of 
constructive criticism, and tend to deny all the achievements of 
the Islamic revolution and overlook all the great tasks which 
have been accomplished since the victory of the Islamic 
revolution -- in particular during the era of reconstruction -- 
are in fact creating a gap in the ranks of the nation, thereby 
undermining the nation's unity and enabling the enemy to exert 
its influence. 
  Ayatollah Yazdi then condemned the slogan of separation of 
religion from politics and, calling on the clergy and all the 
strata of the nation, said: We must move in such a way that our 
policy remains identical to our religion. 
  Furthermore, he condemned the Zionist regime's kidnapping of 
Mustafa al-Dirani, the head of the Believers' Resistance 
Movement of Lebanon, as well as Israel's air attack on the 
Ba'lbek area in southern Lebanon. He considered these acts to 
be a blatant violation of international norms and conventions 
concerning the territorial integrity and independence of a 
country. He, moreover, condemned the silence of international 
forums toward these crimes, and said: These acts of the Zionist 
regime show that until the people of the occupied territories 
return to their homeland, and until Israel is completely 
destroyed, the Mideast region cannot hope to witness peace and 
tranquillity.

  During the meeting, the Chinese charge d'affaires underlined

stability in the region. 
  For his part, the brother deputy prime minister voiced 
appreciation for China's position on the events and developments 
in our region. He also expressed the hope that the ties of 
cooperation between the two countries will improve for the 
benefit of the two friendly peoples' mutual interests. 
  The meeting also touched on the discussions that will be 
held 
at the UN Security Council and our country's position, since 
these discussions run counter to the UN charter and constitute a 
precedent that will affect not only Yemen, but also other 
countries with worse internal situations than those in Yemen.

Shahid-e Hashemi-Nezhad Refinery will increase to 35 million 
cubic meters [m[.sup]3[/]] per day. 
  Engineer Hoseyn Bashiri, chief of the Shahid-e

the three great provinces of Khorasan, Semnan, and Mazandaran 
and it provides fuel for five power plants at Neka, Tus, 
Shari'ati, Shirvan, and Mashhad. 
  He said: In the First Five-Year Plan two units were 
established at the power plant in the Gonbadli region, where we 
share gas fields with Turkmenistan. One of these two units has 
now been put into operation, and it produces 2.5 million 
m[.sup]3[/] of cubic sweet gas. The second unit is also about 
to go into operation. 
  It is necessary to note that the Shahid-e Hashemi Gas 
Refinery, which is considered one of the largest gas refineries 
of its kind, is 35 km from Sarakhs and 165 km from Mashhad, in

  [Text] Tehran, 23 Farvardin [12 April] KEYHAN-E HAVA'I News 
Service -- To do marketing and create facilities to develop 
nonoil exports, trade attaches will soon be stationed at all the 
Islamic Republic of Iran's embassies, with the cooperation of 
the Foreign Ministry. 
  Engineer 'Ali Sa'idlu, deputy minister of commerce for trade 
and chief of the Iran Export Development Center, announced the 
above at a gathering of news reporters. He said: In this regard 
talks have been held with Foreign Ministry officials, because 
trade attaches in the embassies will help develop exports. 
  He discussed the provisions the government has made to 
support exporters of nonoil goods. He said: Based on a measure 
enacted by the Money and Credit Council, the share of credits to 
be provided for exports is increased from last year's 
6.5-percent figure to 8.5 percent for the current year, with a 
commission rate of 18 percent. 
  Engineer Sa'idlu also added: The Supreme Exports Council, 
which met recently chaired by President of the Republic Hojjat 
ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Hashemi-Rafsanjani and attended by a 
number of ministers working in economic affairs, will soon 
prepare a comprehensive export program. 
  He explained that the measures enacted by this council, 
along 
with the new activities of the exports guarantee fund, will 
solve the problems in the export sector. 
  Engineer Sa'idlu noted that imports of goods must be done in 
exchange for exports. On this same basis, the Export Development 
Center sets prices on export goods and gives an affidavit to 
that effect to the exporters. Using these affidavits it is 
possible to import the goods needed by the country. 
  In conclusion, he said that holding an international 
exposition all over the country depends on obtaining 
authorization from the Export Development Center.

were sworn in and then the presidium of the assembly was elected 
of four members as follows: Sha'fil Umar 'Ali, Ahmad Ubayd Bin 
Daghr, 'Abd-al-Qawi Muhammad Rashad, and 'Abd-al-Rahim Asim. 
Mr. Anis Hasan Yahya was elected as speaker of the assembly. 
The members of the assembly decided to change the name of the

facilitate dealings between it and the state institutions. The 
National Assembly discussed with vitality the tasks designated 
to it. It was decided that the assembly continue its sessions 
in order to review the remaining topics of its agenda after the 
assembly had decided that it is in a state of permanent session. 
The attendances [as heard] greeted the big role played by the 
sons of the DRY to repel the Sanaa rulers' forces, which 
continued aggression. They praised the role of the Security 
Council and the positive role played by the Arab countries to 
stop bloodshed.

  [Text] Washington, 16 Ordibehesht [26 April] IRNA -- Last 
week, after several rounds of negotiations with financial 
officials in this country's Export Insurance Company in 
Copenhagen, the delegation from the Central Bank of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran to Denmark succeeded in signing a contract for 
the repayment of credits due. 
  Seyyed Mohammad Hoseyn 'Adeli, chief of the Central Bank of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran, who was in Washington with a 
high-level economic delegation to take part in joint sessions of 
the IMF and the World Bank, announced above. He said: Based on 
this agreement, all unpaid credits to Iran's government and 
private institutions will be paid out of credits given to the 
Islamic Republic of Iran for this purpose. 
  The aforementioned credits exceed $210, and they cover all 
the commitments that are due in the year 1373 [21 March 1994-20 
March 1995]. 
  Based on the signed agreement, the grace period before 
repayment begins on these new credits is two years and the 
repayment period is two years (until the year 2000). 
  The credits lacking insurance will also be repaid based on 
the same conditions. 
  According to 'Adeli, the delegation from the Central Bank of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran to Germany, which was responsible 
for negotiating with a number of German companies, including 
Siemens, Benz, Grundig, Krupp, Philips, [?Prusag] and others, 
has also recently been able to reach agreements about extending 
the repayment of 520 million marks [DM], which lacked Germany's 
Hermes export insurance. 
  This agreement is separate from the previous DM4 billion 
agreement recently made between the Islamic Republic of Iran and 
the German bank.

  [Text] 17 Ordibehesht [7 May] KEYHAN-E HAVA'I News Service 
-- Last year more than 2,000 compatriots living in Germany 
obtained Iranian visas from Iran's representatives in this 
country after continued asylum was denied to them. Half of them 
have returned to the country. 
  The public relations office of Iran's Embassy in Bonn 
reports 
that these people left Iran without authorization for various 
reasons, including such things as the fact that they were 
forbidden to leave, their obligatory military service status was 
unclear or they were planning to continue their educations. 
However, following KEYHAN-E HAVA'I's interview with Deputy 
Foreign Minister Manuchehr Motaki and the clear announcement of 
the Iranian Government's new policy to grant Iranian visas to 
all compatriots outside the country lacking identity papers, 
they went to our country's representative offices in Germany and 
obtained visas. 
  According to the report from the public relations office of 
the Iranian Embassy in Bonn, last year more than 1,000 Iranians 
who obtained visas returned to the country from Germany. 
  Based on the same report, thousands of Iranians living in 
Germany, using the facilities created for them, are happily 
reporting to Iran's Embassy and Consulates and preparing to go 
to Iran with hopes of returning to the embrace of their families. 
  Also, one month prior to this, KEYHAN-E HAVA'I reported the 
issuance of visas for 150 compatriots living in Rome and the 
return of many of them to Iran. 
  It is worth mentioning that on page 1 of KEYHAN-E HAVA'I 
issue 1,078 it was reported that the number of Iranians living 
in Germany who obtained Iranian visas last year was 1,000, but 
the correct figure is 2,000.

<F P=106> [Reports by 'Abdallah Hammudah, Lutfi Shatarah, Hanan </F>
al-Badri, and Salih Qallab: "Massacre in Aden, Emigration From 
Sanaa, and Accusations of Use of Chemical Weapons"] 
  [Excerpts] London, New York, Amman, Aden, Sanaa, AL-SHARQ 
AL-AWSAT -- Fierce fighting continued yesterday in numerous 
areas in Lahij Government, north of Aden. Meanwhile the Yemeni 
Government in Sanaa announced its acceptance of Security Council 
Resolution 924 calling for a cease-fire between northern and 
southern forces. [passage omitted] 
  Well-informed sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the 
fierce fighting in Tawr al-Bahah, Lahij Governorate, is 
attributable to the attempt by four northern battalions to 
advance toward Aden through al-Hawtah, led by Colonel 'Ali 
Muhsin al-Ahmar, commander of the 1st Tank Division and 
half-brother of the Yemeni president. So southern forces worked 
to encircle these units in a bid to capture 'Ali Muhsin 
al-Ahmar, especially as reports had said that a number of 
northern commanders who are the Yemeni president's uncles were 
with him. 
  These developments coincided with accusations exchanged 
between the northern and southern leaderships about the use of 
banned weapons. The accusations included a statement by Judge 
Hammud al-Hattar in Sanaa that southern forces are using napalm 
bombs in their attacks on northern units. He said that there 
"is irrefutable evidence of that." Meanwhile Southern Defense 
Minister Brigadier Haytham Qasim Tahir expressed his suspicions 
that northern forces are using chemical weapons. He added that 
"these suspicions are justifiable." 
  Brig. Haytham said that "our suspicions are reinforced by 
the 
distinct and special relationship between 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih

against the Kurds in 1988." [passage omitted] 
  High-ranking southern leaders have denied reports which have 
aroused alarm among some circles about an advance by northern 
forces toward the Dar Sa'd area. They told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT 
over the telephone: "How can that happen, when Democratic Yemen 
formed its new government yesterday -- a proof that matters are 
stable," despite the ongoing fighting there. 
  Southern officials said that some northern militias 
belonging 
to the Yemeni Reform Grouping have stormed Sabr prison in the 
Tawr al-Bahah area and freed some prisoners. They added that 
Aden forces clashed with them. They confirmed that conditions 
are now calm there. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Rabat, 2 Jun -- Moroccan Prime Minister 
Abdellatif Filali has affirmed that Rabat stipulated the 
expulsion of the alleged Saharan republic from the OAU as a 
condition for the participation of the organization in the 
referendum which the United Nations is to hold in the Moroccan 
Sahara. 
  In a statement to MAP, Filali said that in his view, Tunisia 
could refuse the Polisario mercenaries' attendance at the 
planned OAU conference in Tunis. He pointed out that he is 
unfamiliar with the stance Tunisia will adopt, pointing out that 
this is a matter of principle for Morocco. [passage omitted] 
  Abdellatif Filali pointed out that if the OAU wants to 
participate in the referendum, Morocco sees no objection, but it 
should be logical with itself. He stressed that the UN 
settlement plan stipulates conducting the referendum in this 
province, and that the OAU can not take part after it has 
determined the future of the province by accepting the 
membership of the so-called Saharan republic. It is only when 
this imaginary entity has been brushed aside that Morocco will 
see no reason for the nonparticipation of the OAU, because by 
doing so it will have adopted a logical stance. 
  In this respect, he affirmed that Morocco's relations with 
the African countries have never been as good as they are now, 
since withdrawing from the OAU. [passage omitted] 
  In reply to a question about the appointment of a Moroccan 
ambassador to South Africa, Filali said that it will be done 
soon. It would have been completed a week or 10 days ago but for 
the government reshuffle. He expressed his conviction that it 
is possible to normalize relations with South Africa very soon, 
especially as President Mandela was scheduled to visit Morocco 
after the OAU summit in Tunis. The visit was regrettably 
postponed because the president...[incomplete sentence as heard]

  The Saharan official said that the criteria for determining

  [Text] Baghdad, 1 Jun (INA) -- Official talks between the 
Iraqi Ministry of Interior and the Jordanian Ministry of 
Interior began today. 
  The Iraqi side to the talks was headed by Interior Minister 
Watban Ibrahim al-Hasan, while the Jordanian side was led by 
Jordanian Interior Minister Salamah Hammad. 
  Watban Ibrahim al-Hasan paid tribute to the noble pan-Arab 
stand taken by the Jordanian leadership and people in support of 
Iraq in the course of its confrontation of the conspiratorial 
and hostile schemes targeting its sovereignty and national 
unity. He added that the honorable Jordanian position 
epitomizes the real position of the Arab nation's masses, as 
well as their faith in the inevitable victory of goodness and 
right embodied by Iraq against all imperialist and Zionist 
threats in defense of dear Iraq. 
  The minister asserted that Iraq and Jordan are standing in a 
single trench to vindicate the Arab nation's fateful causes. He 
noted that the fraternal bilateral ties have always been strong 
and excellent in all areas. 
  For his part, the Jordanian minister of interior expressed 
his pleasure, as well as the pleasure of his delegation with 
their visit to their second home, Iraq. He commended the strong 
fraternal ties between the two countries. 
  Salamah Hammad added that the development witnessed in Iraq, 
as well as the principled and firm stands of its leadership in 
defense of the Arab nation's rights have angered the imperialist 
and Zionist quarters, which used all their conspiracy potential 
to undermine the steadfastness of the Iraqi people and achieve 
their hostile political ambitions in the Arab region. 
  The means of promoting and enhancing cooperation between the 
two ministries were discussed at this session of talks. The 
talks were attended by several officials of the ministries of 
interior in the two fraternal countries and the Jordanian 
ambassador in Baghdad.

correspondent in the north, updates us: 
  [Horowitz] Good evening, about half an hour ago, explosions 
were heard once again in the western Galilee. Katyushas were 
fired from Lebanon at the Galilee and the security zone in south 
Lebanon. In response, IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and SLA [South 
Lebanese Army] artillery fired at terrorist positions in south 
Lebanon. IDF guns have shelled terrorist targets there 
intermittently throughout the day. Many northern border 
inhabitants are spending the night in shelters and are 
anticipating a very tense night.

<F P=106> [Report by Randah Habib from Amman] </F>
  [Text] Our radio has learned from reliable sources that 
Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon are making studies in order to 
achieve tripartite economic integration, similar to the Arab 
Cooperation Council. The step is meant to counter the effects 
of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement on the economies of these 
countries. 
  An official Jordanian source has asserted that Jordan 
welcomes other Arab parties to join this integration, especially 
the PLO, if it chooses to link the economy of the autonomous 
area with the Arab states instead of Israel. 
  The initial reaction of the Palestinians to this plan is one 
of PLO concern to maintain and develop good economic ties with 
Jordan. However, a Palestinian source said what is proposed now 
is a three-way Jordanian-Syrian-Lebanese coordination. He 
feared that the Palestinians could be pushed further into the 
lap of Israel. 
  The plan of economic integration will be at the heart of the 
Jordanian-Syrian talks at the level of prime ministers next 
Monday in Amman. This issue was also raised on the bilateral 
level between Jordan and Lebanon during the visit of Lebanese 
Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz to Amman this week. 
  On another level, a summit meeting will be held between 
Jordan's King Husayn and U.S. President Bill Clinton in 
Washington in mid-June to discuss the developments in the peace 
process. Also, the tripartite Jordanian-U.S.-Israeli committee 
that was formed nine months ago will meet next Monday in 
Washington to discuss projects in the Jordan Valley. 
  Amman insists on resolving the border question with Israel 
before setting up any economic projects with the Jewish state.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] The logic of occupiers is the same whatever pretexts 
they might use to express their ideas. Former Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Shamir said he wanted peace, but peace in 
return for peace. This means peace, plus the Arab territories 
Israel occupies. 
  For his part, current Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
has announced that he wants peace, but he wants peace without 
any commitment to comprehensive withdrawal from the Golan. This 
means he wants Syria to give him peace, without committing 
himself to abandoning occupied Syrian territory. 
  Strangely, Rabin accuses Syria of not being ready for peace, 
as if peace is something detached from the Israeli occupation 
and the UN resolutions, especially Resolution 242, which says 
acquisition of land by force is illegal. 
  The U.S. initiative that launched the peace process in 
Madrid, and then in the Washington talks, considered 
implementation of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 the 
basis for reaching a just and comprehensive peace in the region 
in accordance with the principle of exchanging land for peace. 
This exchange does not mean part of the land. It means all of 
the occupied land. This cannot be subject to bargaining under 
any security, political, or interest pretexts. 
  If Israel really wants peace and does not want to obstruct 
the implementation of the U.S. initiative, it would have 
approved the principle of comprehensive withdrawal from the 
Golan in return for full peace. But Israel does not want peace 
unless it is subject to its expansionist logic. This is what 
Rabin recently stated openly when he said he is not prepared to 
pledge full withdrawal from the Golan to Syria. Who, then, is 
responsible for stalemating the peace talks and for the lack of 
progress in the peace process? Is it not Israel, whose leaders 
sometimes speak about conditional peace, and at other times 
about withdrawal from the Golan or about secret talks to abort 
the Madrid and Washington talks? 
  Mixing the cards with Syria will not take place as Rabin 
hopes because Syria stands with a peace in which it will never 
relinquish a grain of its national soil. This fact was 
emphasized by President Hafiz al-Asad during the summit he held 
in Geneva with President Clinton, who in turn stressed the U.S. 
commitment to realize a just and comprehensive peace. 
  After the U.S. emphasis of its commitment to the peace 
process, and in light of the Israeli positions that obstruct the 
implementation of the U.S. initiative, the Israeli leaders stick 
to the logic of occupier, thus rendering U.S. credibility 
hollow, especially because Rabin knows, more than anyone else, 
that the answer he gave to U.S. Secretary of State Christopher 
during his latest visit to Israel was the main reason for the 
stalemating of the peace talks.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] In Abha this afternoon, their 
highnesses the foreign ministers of the GCC [Gulf Cooperation 
Council] member countries began the meetings of the 51st session 
of the GCC Ministerial Council. His Royal Highness Prince Sa'ud 
al-Faysal, the foreign minister and chairman of the session, 
delivered an address at the opening meeting in which he said: 
  [Begin al-Faysal recording] [passage omitted] Brothers, 
while 
we are holding this periodic session of ours, our brothers in 
fraternal and neighboring Yemen are facing difficult and painful 
conditions resulting from the outbreak of disputes between the 
brothers. This led to this country and its people, which is 
dear to all of us, entering a whirlwind of violence and 
internecine bloody fighting, causing a large number of Yemeni 
victims every day in both the north and south. At the same 
time, the installations and potential of this country are being 
subjected to destruction. 
  From the start, the GCC member countries sought to urge our 
brothers in Yemen to work for what is likely to spare fraternal 
Yemen the horrors of war and internecine fighting, and in so 
doing member countries supported the various mediation efforts, 
and took the initiative, through several contacts with the 
leaderships of the two parties to the conflict, to warn them 
against the dire consequences of the escalating disputes between 
them, and to incite them to seek understanding and concord 
between them. However, despite all the efforts and mediation, 
matters have taken a grave turn and reached the point of armed 
confrontation between the brothers in a bitter conflict that 
makes hearts feel pain. [passage omitted] 
  What must be always present in our minds while we discuss 
this matter is that the internecine fighting can in no way 
entrench or protect unity. Quite the contrary, because the 
persistence of bloody confrontation can only create rancor and 
lead to deepening estrangement and differences. It will also 
undermine the bases on which the foundations of harmony and 
understanding could be built. If, in its Resolution No. 924 of 1 
June 1994, the UN Security Council has stressed the eagerness of 
the international community to secure stability and an end to 
the fighting in Yemen, this eagerness is stronger in the GCC. 
Therefore, our council must issue an affirmation that the 
continuation of the fighting is not acceptable to us, whatever 
the cause and source. Likewise, continuation of the fighting 
will have repercussions on the GCC member countries, which will 
lead to the need for member countries to take measures 
concerning this escalating situation. [passage omitted] [end 
recording] 
  [Announcer] With regard to relations with Iran, his highness 
said: We have not been able, until now, to find in Islamic 
Republic of Iran's policies anything that can put trust and 
reassurance in our minds, which would be by Iran's commitment to 
international conventions based on mutual respect and 
noninterference in other states' internal affairs. 
  His highness the foreign minister expressed the Council's 
member states pleasure at the beginning by the Palestinian 
brothers of a new era of effective practice of their national 
rights on a part of their territory, following the agreement 
signed in Cairo in Dhi al Qi'dah 1414 AH, corresponding to May 
1994, for taking over authority in Gaza and Jericho from Israel. 
  On the situation in the Republic of Bosnia Herzegovina, his 
highness said: Although only a short time has passed since we 
expressed our optimism regarding the agreement reached by 
Muslims and Croats with regard to setting up a union between 
them, we see now the Serb's continuation in their oppression and 
aggression against Bosnian Muslims, and their defiance of the 
successive resolutions of international legality for bringint to 
an end the Serbian aggression and protection of the safe Bosnian 
areas. 
  After this, the opening session was adjourned.

  [Text] Abha, Saudi Arabia, June 5, SPA -- Foreign Minister 
Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal said continuation of fighting in Yemen 
will have repercussions on the GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] 
member states. 
  Addressing the 51st session of the GCC Ministerial Council 
here last night, Prince Sa'ud said the brothers in Yemen are 
passing through difficult circumstances and sad events due to 
the continuation of violence and fighting in their country. 
  Yemenis are killed in north and south and properties are 
destroyed as the result of the bloody fighting, he said. 
  Prince Sa'ud noted that the GCC member states, since the 
beginning, had appealed to the brothers in Yemen to avoid their 
country woes of war and settle their dispute through peaceful 
means. 
  Despite the efforts exerted to end the war, yet bloody 
fighting continued in Yemen, he said. 
  Prince Sa'ud noted that during the pilgrimage season 
Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, 
in a personal initiative, called the conflicting parties in 
Yemen to cease fighting taking into account the sanctity of the 
hajj season and the feelings of the Muslims. 
  But we were taken by surprise when the military operations 
continued, he said. 
  When we discuss this issue we should bear in mind that 
fighting will never enhance the pillars of unity, on the 
contrary it will deepen the feelings of hatred and disunity, he 
said. 
  Prince Sa'ud said the UN's Security Council, in its 
resolution Number 924, issued in June 1, reiterated the keenness 
of the international community on stability in Yemen. 
  As continuation of fighting in Yemen will have repercussions 
on the GCC member states, the GCC Ministerial Council should 
issue a resolution to reiterate that continuation of fighting is 
an unacceptable matter, he said and added in the light of the 
adverse impact of the war, it will be an essential matter to 
take measures vis-a-vis such situation. 
  Prince Sa'ud deplored the maneuvers of the Iraqi regime and 
its procrastination in implementing the resolutions issued by 
the Security Council following the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait. 
  Iraq has been following a selective policy regarding the 
resolutions issued by the Security Council, he said. 
  Till now the Iraqi regime has not announced its respect to 
Kuwait's sovereignty and independence, he said and added 
announcement of Iraq to its respect to Kuwait's sovereignty and 
independence constitutes the core of the international 
resolutions. 
  He noted that the failure of the Iraqi regime to implement 
the international resolutions had forced the Security Council to 
continue imposition of sanctions on Iraq. 
  We call the Iraq regime to implement the Security Council's 
Resolutions 706 and 712 so as to pave the way for ending the 
sufferings of the Iraqi people, he said. 
  On relations with Iran, Prince Sa'ud said "we have not yet 
get confident that Iran will adhere to the international 
conventions and norms based on the principle of mutual respect 
and non-interference in the domestic affairs of the other 
countries." 
  But yet we are optimistic that the causes which affect the 
nature of the existing relations between the GCC member states 
and Iran will come to an end, he added. 
  Prince Sa'ud said the problem of the three islands 
constitutes one of the main obstacles that prevent growth of 
Gulf-Iranian relations. 
  The initiative of Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan to settle the 
dispute of the three islands through dialogue constitutes a 
declaration of good intentions, he said. 
  Prince Sa'ud expressed happiness over the new era started by 
the Palestinians to practice their national rights on part of 
their territories following the agreement signed in Cairo in 
last May. 
  He hoped that this development would be an initial step 
towards a comprehensive settlement for the Arab-Israeli dispute 
in a manner that leads to the Israeli withdrawal from the 
occupied Arab territories including Jerusalem in line with the 
Resolutions 242, 338 and 425. 
  Our countries have supported the peace steps and will 
continue to do so, he said. 
  On the other hand, Prince Sa'ud deplored the Israeli 
aggression on Lebanon and said the aggression does not only 
constitute a flagrant aggression on an independent and UN's 
member state, but it also runs counter to the Israeli adherence 
towards the peace process. 
  We call on the UN and the Security Council to take the 
appropriate measures that prevent recurrence of such aggression 
and guarantee the implementation of the Resolution 425 issued by 
the Security Council on Lebanon. 
  On Bosnia-Herzegovina, Prince Sa'ud condemned the Serb 
aggression on the Muslims in violation to the international 
resolutions. 
  He noted that the refusal of the Serbs to withdraw from the 
Bosnian city of Gorazde reflects their unwillingness to 
positively respond with the ongoing international efforts to 
settle the dispute. 
  It is high time for the UN and international community to 
put 
pressure on the Serbs until they comply with the international 
resolutions, he said.

  [Text] Abha, 5 Jun -- The GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] 
countries' foreign ministers have stressed today that "the 
continuation of the fighting in Yemen would lead the countries 
of the GCC Council to take appropriate stances toward the side 
that does not abide by the cease-fire, after consultations with 
Arab and international parties about the measures necessary to 
be taken by the Security Council vis-a-vis this escalating 
situation in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter." 
  The ministers also stressed, in the final communique they 
released after the end of their current session, that "it is 
absolutely impossible to impose this unity by military means." 
  They noted that the union, which was set up by agreement 
between the two independent states -- the Yemen Arab Republic 
and the Democratic People's Republic of Yemen in May 1990 -- 
"cannot continue except by the consent of the two parties." 
  The final press release said that "faced with the fait 
accompli of the fact that one of the parties announced its 
decision to revert back to the former status of two republics 
and the setting up of a the Democratic Republic of Yemen, the 
two parties can only deal with this situation through peaceful 
means." 
  The press release added that "in consideration of the 
motives 
of the sincere sons of Yemen regarding unity, the two sides can 
deal with situation only within a framework of peaceful methods." 
  Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal, chairman of the current GCC 
ministerial session, refused to comment on whether the final 
press release meant putting political pressure on the side that 
did not accept a cease- fire. He said: "I have no more details 
to give other than the ones mentioned in the final press 
release." 
  The GCC's ministerial council urged Yemen's leaders to put 
the Yemen's interests and its people above all considerations 
and to respond immediately to UN Security Council Resolution 924 
to stop military operations immediately and to resort to 
dialogue in order to stop bloodshed and protect lives and 
possessions. 
  The council expressed "sorrow for the continuation of the 
fighting despite the issuing of the UN resolution." 
  The council statement said that "the continuation between 
the 
two parties made leaders in southern Yemen declare the 
establishment of the Democratic Republic of Yemen." [sentence as 
received] 
  The statement clarified that "although the council 
appreciates the sincere motives of Yemen's sons for unity, it 
confirms that it cannot impose this unity through military 
means."

  [Text] Abha, Saudi Arabia, June 5 (AFP) -- Five Gulf Arab 
states on Sunday [5 June] implicitly recognized the breakaway 
southern state declared after the outbreak of Yemen's civil war. 
  Foreign ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) 
termed as "a fait accompli the declaration by one of the parties 
of the Yemen Democratic Republic and the return to the 
situation" before the country was unified in 1990. 
  Only Qatar voiced reservations on the statement issued in 
the 
Saudi town of Abha by its partners in the GCC -- Saudi Arabia, 
Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman and the United Arab Emirates.

  [Text] Their Highnesses the GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] 
foreign ministers this afternoon ended the meetings of the 51st 
session of the Ministerial Council, which was held in the city 
of Abha and lasted for two days. 
  At the end of the meeting, GCC Secretary General Shaykh 
Fahim 
Bin-Sultan al-Qasimi read the press release, which said the 
following: 
  [Begin al-Qasimi recording] The Ministerial Council followed 
with great anxiety the painful developments in Yemen and the 
consequences of the continuation of the internecine fighting, 
which made the leaders in South Yemen declare the setting up of 
the Democratic Republic of Yemen. In this context the council 
welcomed the issuance of the UN Security Council Resolution No. 
924 and expressed its great regret for the continued fighting 
despite the issuance of that resolution. 
  If the UN Security Council stressed in its Resolution 924 
the 
eagerness of the international community to protect peace and 
stability in Yemen, this eagerness increases within the 
framework of the GCC; thus, the council calls on the Yemeni 
leaders to put the interests of Yemen and its people above all 
considerations and to respond immediately to the requirements of 
the UN Security Council by ending the military operations 
forthwith and having recourse to dialogue in order to avoid 
bloodshed and protect lives and property. 
  On the premise of the fact that unity is a request of the 
sons of the Arab nation, the council welcomed Yemeni unity when 
it was set up by consent of the two independent states, the 
Yemeni Arab Republic and the People's Democratic Republic of 
Yemen in 1990. Consequently its continuation can only take place 
with the consent of the two sides. 
  Faced with a de facto situation embodied by one of the 
parties announcing the return to its former status and the 
establishment of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, the two sides 
cannot deal with each other in that framework except through 
peaceful ways and means. 
  While the council appreciates the desire of Yemen's sons for 
unity, it stresses that it cannot at all impose this unity using 
military means. The council states that the continuation of the 
fighting must have repercussions, not only on Yemen but on the 
council's states, making them take suitable stances toward the 
party that does not abide by the cease-fire agreement. 
  It will also make them consult with Arab and international 
parties on necessary measures to be taken in the Security 
Council toward that deteriorating condition in line with the 
principles of the United Nation's Charter. 
  The GCC Council condemned the Iraqi regime for not 
completely 
abiding with international legitimacy, for continuing its 
procrastination, violating cease-fire terms underlined in 
Resolution 687 by reiterating its expansionist claims on Kuwait, 
and not recognizing its sovereignty, threatening its 
independence, and endangering regional security. 
  The statement expressed its appreciation to member states in 
the Security Council for their firm stance calling on the 
necessity for Iraqi respect for the sovereignty, independence, 
and international borders of the State of Kuwait in a legal, 
documented way. 
  The council expressed its utmost concern for the unity of 
Iraq, its sovereignty, and the safety of its lands, and its 
sympathy for the brotherly Iraqi people in their plight -- for 
which the Iraqi regime was fully responsible. 
  The Ministerial Council also reviewed the latest development 
regarding relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran; and 
reiterated its firm stance that supports and backs the United 
Arab Emirates' [UAE] sovereignty on its three islands: Upper 
Tunb, Lower Tunb, and Abu Musa. The council stressed its full 
support for all the peaceful measures and ways undertaken by the 
UAE to recover its sovereignty over its three islands. 
  In its final press release, the council denounced the 
continuing campaigns that are being waged by Iranian mass media 
against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia regarding pilgrimage 
arrangements -- a matter that contravenes relations of good 
neighborliness. It does not serve the boosting of relations and 
the establishment of an atmosphere of trust and tranquility in 
the region. 
  The council expresses its utmost gratitude and praise for 
the 
huge and sincere efforts that are deployed by the Kingdom of 
Saudi Arabia, at its forefront King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz Al 
Sa'ud, custodian of the two holy mosques, to enable the pilgrims 
to carry out their pilgrimage rituals in security and ease. 
  The council also discussed the developments of the peace 
process in the Middle East. In this context, it expressed its 
aspirations that bilateral negotiations would achieve a 
fundamental progress on all levels; especially Syrian and 
Lebanese levels. In this connection, the council welcomes the 
signing of the Cairo Agreement on 4 May 1994, because it 
represents a positive step on the path of finding a just, 
comprehensive and lasting solution to the Palestinian cause and 
the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
  The council also followed with concern the continuing 
Israeli 
violations of the sovereignty of Lebanon -- a matter that 
contravenes international charters and the spirit of the peace 
process. The Ministerial Council strongly condemned Israel's 
attacks against Lebanese villages; the killing of civilians, the 
destruction of properties and its hampering of the ongoing peace 
efforts. 
  The council renewed its call to the UN Security Council to 
enable the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina to exercise the 
legitimate right of self-defense in accordance with Article 51 
of the UN Charter; including the lifting of the arms embargo 
that has been imposed; the tightening of sanctions; the increase 
in pressure on Serbia and Montenegro; and to prevent reward for 
the aggressor. [end recording]

  [Text] Jeddah, June 4, SPA -- Custodian of the Two Holy 
Mosques King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz has expressed appreciation 
for the heartfelt feelings spelt out by the citizens and leaders 
of the fraternal and friendly countries following the successful 
operation he underwent last Monday [30 May] in Jeddah. 
  Thanks to the almighty God, I have recovered quickly and the 
operation did not take a long time, said the king. 
  Addressing a group of citizens here yesterday the monarch 
reiterated his determination to go ahead in the service of the 
citizens. 
  King Fahd reiterated the determination of the kingdom to 
adhere to the Islamic teachings and said the establishment of 
the Consultative Council came in line with the teachings of 
Islam. 
  He noted that the Consultative Council comprises a group of 
qualified and efficient people. 
  Replying [to] questions raised by the reporter of Middle 
East 
Broadcasting Center (MBC), King Fahd highlighted the attention 
given by the state to the pilgrims. 
  He said he will make an inspecting tour of Muna, 'Arafat and 
al- Muzdalifah, accompanied by the concerned authorities, to 
explore suitable means for extending better services to the 
pilgrims and enabling them perform their rituals in comfort and 
ease and in particular at jamarat (stoning zone). 
  I am determined to go ahead in developing Mecca and Medina, 
but this does not mean that the other Saudi cities will be 
neglected, he said and added 'with the grace of the God we will 
provide all the regions with the required facilities and 
services including electric and telephone services and 
desalinated water. [no closing punctuation as received] 
  King Fahd said the state would benefit from the ideas 
presented by the members of the Consultative Council on means of 
serving the country. 
  I, and the Council of Ministers are keen on listening to the 
views and ideas of the Consultative Council, he said. 
  King Fahd pointed out that the new systems, recently 
announced, have opended new horizons for the service of the 
country. 
  King Fahd noted that the new regulations and systems have 
fixed the period of the portfolios and added 'but changing of 
ministers or officials does not necessarily mean that they have 
committed a mistake'. 
  Shedding light on the economic situation in the kingdom, 
King 
Fahd described the kingdom's economy as strong. 
  He noted that the kingdom had spent billions of riyals and 
dollars because of the Gulf crisis caused by Iraq and in 
addition to that, King Fahd, said the country had extended large 
amounts of money to a number of Arab, African and Asian 
countries in forms of grants and loans. 
  King Fahd criticized those who write about the kingdom's 
economy in a biased way. 
  Thanks to the God who has bestowed on us so many bounties, 
the kingdom has so many resources inclduing oil 'and a number of 
new oil wells were recently discovered south of Riyadh'. 
  He noted that these new wells are expected to be on stream 
soon and their production would be exported via the country's 
sea ports either in the west or east of the kingdom. 
  King Fahd described the oil of the new wells as oil of high 
quality. 
  Moreover, King Fahd said gold was discovered in the kingdom 
and arrangements were underway to benefit from these new 
discoveries. 
  Highlighting the existing confidence between the state and 
the citizens, King Fahd said the state does not interfere in the 
affairs of the citizens an well as in the manner the citizens 
manage their properties. 
  Refuting the fabricated reports on the economic situation in 
the kingdom, King Fahd said it would not be a shameful thing if 
the state resorted to obtain loans from inside or outside the 
country. 
  He noted that reduction of expenditure by about 20 percent, 
as being announced by the minsiter of finance and national 
economy, would not have an adverse impact on the existing major 
projects. 
  The Saudi currency is covered by gold and hard currencies, 
he 
said. 
  The monarch said the state had extended soft and 
free-interest loans, worth of billion riyals, to the citizens 
including real estate and agricultural loans. 
  On handling over of some of the public enterprises to the 
private sector, King Fahd said shares would be floated for 
subscription by the citizens in enterprises like the national 
airlines, posts, telegraphs and telephones. 
  There is also possiblity of the private's sector's 
contribution to oil refinery, he said and added the state will 
hand over to the citizens any enterprise that can be run by them. 
  This policy will be carried out in the appropriate time 
after 
making the required arrangements, he said. 
  On the developments of the situation in Yemen, King Fahd 
said 
the kingdom's relations with North and South Yemen are 
deeprooted and added 'we believe that all Yemenis are keen on 
the stability of their country'. 
  He commended the resolution recently issued by the Security 
Council and hoped that it would pave the way for ending the 
fighting in the country. 
  Yemen is a dear country and we do respect it, he said and 
added the kingdom is keen on maintaining good relations with all 
Arab countries. 
  It is hoped that the Security Council's resolution, which is 
accepted by the concerned parties, will be implemented because 
failure of its implemtation will mean continuation of 
bloodshedding, he elaborated. 
  King Fahd reiterated that the kingdom does not interfere in 
any Arab problem unless it is requested to do so.

<F P=106> [By Mohammad Attar] </F>
  [Excerpts] Aden, Yemen, June 5 (AFP) -- Northern warplanes 
on Sunday [5 June] blew up an oil storage tank at the refinery 
in the southern stronghold of Aden as Yemen's civil war entered 
its second month, a southern military spokesman said. 
  The spokesman said a fire "broke out in a fuel storage tank 
at the refinery," about 10 kilometers (six miles) from here and 
the main source of fuel for southern troops loyal to 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid. 
  It refines some 140,000 barrels of crude per day. 
  Anti-aircraft fire shot down one of the warplanes but the 
others escaped, the spokesman said. 
  Witnesses meanwhile said the north fired two 
surface-to-surface missiles at Aden overnight, but the southern 
city's air defenses shot one out of the sky over an uninhabited 
area and the other plunged harmlessly into the sea. 
  And a northern military spokesman in Sanaa said southern 
forces fired two Scud missiles at residential areas of the 
northern city of Ta'izz but both were "intercepted" without 
causing casualties. 
  Both sides accused the other of cowardice in the attacks. 
  A southern spokesman said the raid on the refinery was a 
"flagrant challenge to the will of the international community," 
referring to a UN resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire 
in the month-old war. 
  But the north also called the attack on Ta'izz, about 156 
kilometers (90 miles) northwest of the southern stronghold of 
Aden, "a violation" of the resolution. 
  Neither side in the war which has pitted rival north and 
south troops since May 5 has respected the ceasefire call 
adopted Wednesday by the UN Security Council. 
  Heavy artillery fire continued throughout Saturday evening 
north of Aden as southern forces fought to hold back an 
offensive by northern troops of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. 
  The northern forces were reported Friday to be only 15 
kilometers (nine miles) from Aden where al-Bid, the country's 
former vice- president, proclaimed an independent state on May 
21 after a failed four-year union. 
  Southern soldiers have launched a counter-offensive to 
retake 
the town of Lahij about 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of Aden, 
according to soldiers near the front. 
  A southern spokesman said "several members of the Jihad" 
Moslem fundamentalist organisation which backs Salih had been 
captured at Kharaz. 
  'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri, appointed vice president of the 
breakaway Yemen Democratic Republic, told AFP that his forces 
might call for Saudi military support in battling northern 
troops. 
  He said southern leaders had "not yet decided", but added 
that "everything is possible and legitimate to protect our 
people." Southern forces are outnumbered by those of the north.

  Gulf Arab states met Sunday in Abha, southwest Saudi Arabia, 
to debate the Yemeni conflict after Saudi Foreign Minister 
Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal warned that the Gulf Cooperation Council 
(GCC) could intervene if the fighting continued. 
  Five foreign ministers from the six-member council attended 
the talks after Qatari Foreign Minister Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jabir 
Al Thani returned home suffering from an illness, sources said. 
  The south's appointed prime minister Haydar Abu-Bakr 
al-'Attas met in Jeddah Saturday with Saudi Defense Minister 
Prince Sultan Ibn-'Abd-al-'Aziz, the Saudi Press Agency said 
without giving details. 
  Al-'Attas is expected Sunday in Cairo for more talks on the 
conflict.

  [Text] Little Aden, Yemen, June 5 (AFP) -- Northern 
warplanes firing a missile blew up two vast oil storage tanks 
during a raid on Aden's refinery on Sunday [5 June], officials 
said. 
  A 25,000 tonnes container of crude oil burst into flames 
after northern warplanes launched an air-to-ground missile, 
setting fire to the neighbouring tank, refinery director Fadl 
Haydar told AFP. 
  Firemen aided by volunteers used foam to try to contain 
towering flames in a desperate bid to stop the blaze spreading 
to the four neighbouring tanks. 
  Haydar warned the whole plant "could be set alight if we 
don't extinguish the fire quickly." 
  Hundreds of people living nearby fled their homes in panic 
as 
waves of intense heat and smoke radiated from the burning tanks. 
  "It's hell, it's hell," shouted one lorry driver, heading 
east away from the scene with his family towards the southern 
stronghold of Aden. 
  A southern military spokesman said fire "broke out in a fuel 
storage tank at the refinery," which is about 10 kilometers (six 
miles) from the center of the southern stronghold of Aden after 
the northern air raid. 
  Anti-aircraft fire shot down one of the warplanes but the 
others escaped, he said without specifying how many took part in 
the attack. 
  The facility, which refines some 140,000 barrels a day, is 
the largest in Yemen and the only one supplying southern troops 
who have been locked in a grim battle with northern rivals since 
May 5. 
  Haydar said the refinery's other installations had not been 
touched and there had not been any casualties. 
  A southern military spokesman denounced it as a "cowardly" 
raid and a "flagrant challenge" to the UN Security Council 
resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in the month-old 
war. 
  It is the third attack in a week on the refinery. The two 
others missed their target and wounded about 10 people in 
neighbouring districts. 
  Meanwhile in Aden queues quickly formed at petrol stations 
as 
residents learnt of the attack in a statement broadcast by 
southern leaders. 
  Neither side in the war which has pitted troops loyal to 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and southerners who back 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid has respected the UN's ceasefire call adopted 
Wednesday.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by "a responsible source at the Defense </F>
Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Yemen" to the YEMENI NEWS 
AGENCY, Aden] 
  [Text] Here is little Saddam, or the backward Saddam, as 
described by the militant brother and great patriot, 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid, chairman of the Presidential Council. Here is little 
Saddam or the backward Saddam reappearing to try his luck in 
Yemen, and there are similarities between today and yesterday, 
when Arab and international states unanimously condemned Iraq's 
invasion of Kuwait, and stood as one to force the Iraqi Forces 
to withdraw from Kuwaiti territory. After the failure of Saddam 
Husayn's scheme in Kuwait, he proceded to burn the oil 
refineries and oilfields of fraternal Kuwait, dear to the heart 
of every Arab. Today our people stood steadfast in the 
Democratic Republic of Yemen with their brave Armed Forces, in 
the face of the aggressive invasion of the ruling military 
regime in Sanaa, and caused the failure of its attempts to seize 
southern Yemen by force. There were unanimous Arab and 
international demands for a cease-fire and the aggressor's 
withdrawal. 
  At this very moment, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has resorted to an 
attempt to destroy the Aden refineries, a vital and important 
facility for the entire Yemeni people, both in the south and the 
north. How ironic that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's four aircraft, 
which carried out the aerial attack on the Aden refineries, 
should destroy the fuel tank which supplies fuel to the northern 
governorates. Our great air defenses were vigilant regarding 
this aggression, and shot down three aircraft, while the fourth 
one fled. We shall supply local, Arab, and international public 
opinion with more details later. God is great, God is great.

<F P=106> [Report by Falih al-Saghir and Sa'ud al-Rayyis from Aden] </F>
  [Excerpt] Officials in Aden have welcomed international 
moves to halt the fighting in Yemen. 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri, 
named by southern leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid as his deputy, said 
in a telephone interview with AL-YAWM that, for now, 
international intervention is the only way to stop the war. 
  Al-Jifri predicted imminent international recognition of 
south Yemen's secession. He said delay in recognition was 
natural in view of the rapid succession of developments in Yemen. 
  'Ali Salim al-Bid stood ready to meet with President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih anywhere, on condition that the meeting 
coincided with a cease-fire and a pullback by northern forces to 
the pre-unity lines. Victims of the offensive on Shabwah 
Governorate showed symptoms indicating the use of chemical 
weapons, al-Jifri said. 
  The southern official said he thought it unlikely that 
northern forces would enter Aden, citing strong defenses, rather 
than political considerations. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 3 Jun (MENA)--Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq 
al- Shar' affirmed today that Israel's latest aggression against 
south Lebanon yesterday is clear evidence that Israel does not 
desire peace and places obstacles to the peace efforts to cause 
tension in the region. 
  In press statements made here today, he said the lack of 
progress in the peace process is being blamed on Israel, which 
does not want to withdraw from the Arab territories it occupied 
in 1967. 
  He said that the Arab parties are committed to the peace 
process and the UN Security Council resolutions. 
  Answering a question on the effect of the Israeli stance on 
achieving progress on the Syrian track, he said that although 
Israel does not want peace, the United States will not abandon 
the peace process. 
  He said the Lebanese have the right to defend themselves 
against the Israeli occupation of south Lebanon to implement 
international legitimacy and Security Council resolutions. 
  On the Syrian presence in Lebanon, he said this presence is 
aimed at helping the Lebanese people in reconstruction efforts. 
  Commenting on the situation in Yemen, the Syrian foreign 
minister said his country is currently holding intense contacts 
to stop the ongoing fighting in Yemen and preserve Yemen's unity.

  [Text] The user trials of surface-to-surface medium-range 
missile Prithvi [Earth] got under way today with the successful 
launching of the missile. According to Defense Ministry 
sources, the test launch fully met the requirements. Army 
authorities are conducting the trials in actual user 
configuration at the Chandipur interim test range near Balasore 
in Orissa. According to agencies, the first launch has been 
targeted to hit the Wheeler Islands located in the Bay of 
Bengal. The next phase of trial of the 150-to- 250-km-range 
missile will be test-fired in actual battlefield conditions. 
The missile will be targeted against built-up targets to test 
its accuracy and the impact of conventional weapons. The trials 
are to last for over two months before the missile is declared 
fit for induction into the army. 
  The trials were postponed last month as the prime minister 
was visiting the United States. 
  [Hong Kong AFP in English at 0733 GMT on 4 Jun 94 in a 
similar report adds: "PTI said the Prithvi (Earth) missile was 
fired in clear weather from a mobile launcher at the 
Chandipur-on-Sea test range in the eastern coastal state of 
Orissa. 
  "The missile streaked diagonally into the sky at 11:40am 
(0610 GMT), targeted to hit Wheeler's Island in the Bay of 
Bengal about 75 kilometres (45 miles) from the test range, PTI 
said."]

  [Text] A responsible source has denounced the new scandal 
fabricated by the media of the renegade secessionist gang in the 
Socialist Party headed by traitor agent 'Ali Salim al-Bid, 
within the framework of a series of fabricated scandals and lies 
propagated by this gang. 
  The latest of these lies claimed that our heroic Armed 
Forces 
fired a missile on Aden, and that shrapnel from the missile, 
which was exploded in the air by the so-called air defenses of 
the rebellious, secessionist gang hit a number of worshipers in 
Aden during dawn prayers. 
  This false and fabricated report, which aims at concealing 
the crimes of this gang in a manner that exposes it, included a 
statement by a citizen who was forced to speak on television and 
said the explosion occurred while the worshipers were kneeling. 
Another citizen said the explosion took place during the final 
stage of prayers. A third citizen spoke about prayers while the 
announcer was telling him what to say. At the beginning of the 
report it was said that the missile was intercepted by the air 
defenses of this gang and exploded in the air. 
  This disgraceful contradiction shows the lowly means 
employed 
by the media of the renegade secessionist gang in fabricating 
deceptive reports and falsifying facts. 
  The source said the masses of our Yemeni people know who 
shells mosques, and who tortured to death our esteemed religious 
scholars, and who attacked Sanaa, Ta'izz and Zinjibar, as well 
as al-Rahidah and 'Ataq with missiles, in addition to what 
happened in the economic and commercial capital, Aden, in 
January 1986 during the bloody coup against the legitimate 
leadership of the Socialist party at that time. 
  Our people in all governorates also know those who have 
renounced the values of our Islamic religion and all deep-rooted 
norms and heritage throughout their known criminal history.

  [Text] A military source has categorically denied that the 
aircraft belonging to the forces of unity and legitimacy bombed 
the Aden refinery or targeted any of its installations today, 
Sunday. The source said this refinery and other economic 
installations are the property of the Yemeni people and will 
never be a target of the forces of unity and legitimacy. 
Instead, they will be protected and defended by these forces. 
  The source said the hysteria of the elements of the 
rebellious secessionist gang has reached such an extent that 
this criminal gang does not hesitate to commit the most heinous 
crimes against the people, the homeland, and their achievements. 
  The source said these criminal elements are currently 
destroying vital economic installations in the areas they 
control, including the shelling of the Aden refinery with a 
missile today in order to destroy it, arouse public opinion, and 
evoke an increased sense of grudge and hatred among the sons of 
the one Yemeni homeland. 
  The source said this secessionist gang did not hesitate to 
strike cities and innocent people with missiles in the 
densely-populated residential areas in Sanaa, Zinjibar, 'Ataq, 
and al-Hudaydah. Being in the last throes of death, this gang 
carried out the same criminal conduct by destroying and damaging 
economic installations and targets in many of the areas it used 
to control, as an expression of the sense of grudge and despair 
overwhelming it. 
  The source warned this criminal gang against committing more 
criminal actions against the people and the homeland. He said 
this gang will never escape punishment. He denounced the 
continued acts of aggression this gang is carrying out against 
the citizens and our valiant Armed Forces, thus violating UN 
Security Council Resolution 924 and defying both the national 
consensus and the international will.

Mansur, the defense minister, has emphasized that our Armed 
Forces -- the forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy -- 
have completed their tasks successfully, and have, for some 
time, been tightening the noose around the rebellious 
secessionist gang entrenched inside Aden. 
  In a statement to the Yemeni News Agency, SABA', he said our 
Armed Forces have executed their combat operations in all the 
axes with accuracy and success, confident in God and the cause 
for which they are striving, namely, the Yemeni homeland's unity. 
  Out of fear for the lives of the the valiant city's citizens 
and their property, and out of fear for the lives and property 
of Aden's population, our Armed Forces -- the forces of unity 
and legitimacy -- have for the past two days not returned the 
aggressive artillery fire directed by the rebellious 
secessionist elements from within the beloved city, the minister 
said. 
  The military command will give thought to the safety of the 
city and its population and not return the artillery fire 
emanating from the valiant city of Aden. The brother minister 
reassured our people in the beloved city of Aden that the forces 
of unity and legitimacy will [words indistinct] and [words

secessionist gang that has made the citizens of beloved Aden 
human shields behind which they are taking cover. This is in 
addition to acts of subversion and destruction of numerous 
economic facilities in Aden and other Yemeni cities that had 
been under their control before our Armed Forces flushed them 
out.

Armed Forces operating in the battlefields in this axis are 
eager not to harm our people in these areas, which are being 
purged of separatist forces. The correspondent went on to say: 
Our forces are making a deliberate effort to avoid damage to 
vital and service facilities that serve people in these areas. 
He pointed to the damage caused to economic installations, as 
well as the destruction of all vital facilities carried out by 
the secessionist gang so that citizens may not benefit from 
them. For example, in the first days of the secessionist gang's 
unleashing of the crisis, it cut off the power supply feeding 
Abyan from Aden in retaliation against its heroic sons for the 
nationalist unity-orientated positions they have taken, for 
their confrontation of this gang's secessionist plan, and also 
for the support they have lent to the forces of unity and 
legitimacy, which are valiantly confronting the destructive 
secessionist plan announced by the war criminal, agent, and 
traitor 'Ali al-Bid. Furthermore, several other economic 
facilities and service installations became targets of 
aggressive bombardment by the secessionist and separatist forces 
when they were compelled to retreat and withdraw from their 
positions. This reflects the malicious spirit and destructive 
instincts of this criminal secessionist gang.

  [Text] Brother Colonel Ahmad Jabir 'Uthman, a senior 
officer in the Political Security Apparatus [PSA], joined by a 
large group of officers, NCO's, and soldiers from the PSA, who 
were misled for a while by the rebellious secessionist gang led 
by traitor agent 'Ali al-Bid, have declared that they are 
joining the forces of unity protecting constitutional 
legitimacy. They voiced their rejection and denunciation of the 
declaration of secession and said they were ready to defend 
unity and confront all schemes aimed at disrupting the homeland. 
  Brother Col. Ahmad Jabir gave serious and important 
information about details of the criminal secessionist schemes 
of the elements of apostasy and secession. He said he was 
tasked by the secessionist gang with administering and 
overseeing the destructive military and security operations in 
Lahij, Abyan, and Shabwah governorates as part of the 
implementation of the secessionist scheme. He explained that as 
soon as he discovered the reality of the criminal scheme against 
the sovereignty of the Republic of Yemen and its unity harbored 
by those who are laying in wait for Yemen, he retreated from his 
positions toward the secessionist gang and refused to go ahead 
with their treacherous scheme. He also delivered serious and 
important documents to the authorities on that secessionist 
scheme against the Yemeni homeland and its unity. 
  Col. Ahmad Jabir 'Uthman said he had seen large amounts of 
military equipment arriving from abroad for the rebellious 
secessionist gang. 
  The joining brothers voiced their regret and repentance 
regarding the period they spent with the elements of apostasy 
and secession without knowing the extent of the aims and 
dimensions of the conspiracy concocted against Yemen and its 
unity. They announced their loyalty to constitutional 
legitimacy and declared they will be at the forefront of the 
ranks defending unity and legitimacy.

  [Text] Sanaa, June 5 (AFP) -- Six-hundred-and-thirteen 
soldiers loyal to northern President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih have 
been killed and 2,030 wounded in Yemen's month-old civil war, 
officials said in the first official toll published here Sunday 
[5 June]. 
  Another 1,200 northern troops have been reported missing 
while 901 are being held prisoner by southern forces backing 
Salih's rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid, a military spokesman told the 
northern-controlled SABA' news agency. 
  He said the number of prisoners being held in "concentration 
camps in Aden" had been supplied by the International Committee 
of the Red Cross. 
  It was the first official, if partial, toll to be given 
since 
fighting broke out on May 5. 
  Late Saturday a southern leader said in Cairo that 80,000 
people had been killed, wounded or made homeless in the 
fighting, without giving a breakdown.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul in </F>
al-Biqa' valley, by Ramadan Husayn in Cairo; date not given; 
from the "Dialogue From Afar" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Husayn] Mr. Minister, how is the security situation 
in light of the Israeli raids against southern Lebanon? 
  [Dallul] Israel frequently perpetrates unjustified acts of 
aggression against Lebanon, its land, and its people--women, 
children, and the elderly. Lately, it has even burned crops to 
shake Lebanon, weaken its people, disturb its security and 
stability, and harm its sovereignty. We are looking to the 
world community and our Arab brothers. We urgently need their 
help and support. We are also waiting for the Security Council 
to shoulder its responsibility, and we expect the world to 
condemn the Israeli aggressions. What sin have the children, 
women and old men committed that they should be shelled? 
Recently, Israel attacked our children with 500-kg and 1000-kg 
bombs. The soil, the crops, and the rocks have turned black. 
Israel burned the crops that are the only livelihood of the 
sons of Lebanon. 
  [Husayn] Has Lebanon held contacts with the Security Council 
permanent members and other influential parties to stop the 
Israeli aggressions? 
  [Dallul] We have filed a complaint with the UN Security 
Council, and we have held contacts with the permanent members. 
We also informed all influential countries of the Israeli acts 
of aggression against the people of Lebanon. We hope the world, 
especially the Security Council, will react favorably by 
condemning Israel and forcing it to stop these repeated acts of 
aggression against our people and land. 
  [Husayn] Mr. Minister, what do you think are the objectives 
of the Israeli raids? 
  [Dallul] Israel wants to cause cracks in Lebanese society. 
It wants to continue its occupation of Lebanese territory, and 
it wants to force us to confront the Resistance, which is 
performing its duty against the occupation. Resistance is a 
legitimate right of every people whose land is occupied. This 
has happened in Europe and the entire world. When territory 
comes under occupation, the people of this territory must 
confront the occupation. Resistance is a legitimate right of 
our people, and what we are doing is a cry in the face of the 
occupier, a cry that it leave our land and stop its aggression 
against our people. Israel also wants to stir up domestic 
sedition in Lebanese society. But the people of Lebanon are 
confronting the aggressions with a united position bordering on 
heroism.

  [Text] The secretary-general of the Hizballah Islamic 
revolutionary movement of Lebanon met the foreign minister of 
our country ['Ali Akbar Velayati] in Damascus this morning. 
According to a report by the Central News Unit correspondent, 
at that meeting, which took place at the Iranian embassy, the 
latest developments in Lebanon -- especially the recent 
onslaught of the Zionist regime against the southern parts of 
that country -- were assessed. 
  Sayyid Hasan Nasarallah, describing the various aspects of 
this invasion, stressed: These provocations of the enemy will 
never be able to shake the resolve of the region's Muslims to 
liberate Islamic lands. He said: The presence of the masses of 
the Lebanese people, groups, and personalities in the funeral 
procession for the martyrs of this violent onslaught is 
indicative of the firm resolve of Muslims to remain steadfast 
and continue the path of the martyrs. 
  Mr. Velayati for his part expressed the condolences of the 
leadership, government, and people of Iran and emphasized: The 
Zionist's motive behind this aggression is the expansion of 
their domination over Islamic and Arab countries.

  [Text] Lebanese President Ilyas al-Hirawi and Prime 
Minister Rafiq al-Hariri have made separate telephone calls to 
'Allamah Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah. They discussed with 
him the recent Zionist assaults on the Ba'labakk area. 
  Al-Hariri sent Lebanese Minister of State for Finance Fu'ad 
Sinyurah to the headquarters of Hizballah's Consultative 
Council. Sinyurah, speaking for the Lebanese Government, 
affirmed that the government support for the resistance will 
continue until the occupied territories are liberated. 
  Sinyurah announced: We express our appreciation for 
Hizballah's martyrs who gave their lives to defend the homeland 
and confront Israeli arrogance. 
  Meanwhile, Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz described 
the Zionists' recent brutal attacks on Ba'labakk as an attempt 
to damage Syrian-Lebanese relations. 
  Speaking to the newspaper AL-SAFIR, Buwayz said that Israel 
has lately been exerting pressure on the Lebanese Government to 
make it halt the resistance operations against the Zionists in 
south Lebanon. He pointed out, however, that the Lebanese 
Government believes that as long as the Zionists occupy parts of 
the Lebanese territory, resistance is the people's legitimate 
right. 
  The Lebanese foreign minister referred to the total backing 
that the Lebanese public and their various political factions 
are giving to the resistance movement. He accused the United 
Nations of weakness and inability to adopt firm resolutions to 
halt the Zionist attacks on Lebanon.

  [Text] According to information from the eastern sector of 
the south, the Israeli occupation forces have deployed troop 
reinforcements and armored vehicles in their Kawkaba and Suq 
al-Khan positions. They also strafed the surrounding hills and 
woods and shelled the hills and woods in Mashgharah and 'Ayn 
al-Tinah. 
  Enemy aircraft meanwhile continued their psychological 
warfare against the citizens of the south. Helicopters overflew 
Iqlim al- Tuffah and al-Nabatiyah this afternoon. 
  This morning Kafr Rumman's eastern hills were the target of 
sporadic bombardment with incendiary shells from the enemy's 
positions on the al-Tuhrah Hills. 
  In another development, the citizen Jum'ah Shihadah 
al-Khalid 
died this morning when a fragmentation bomb detonated inside a 
grove in the al-Shawakir areas south of Tyre where he was 
tilling the land. His body was transferred to Tyre's Jabal 
'Amil Hospital. It is noteworthy that the al-Shawakir area is 
close to al-Rashidiyah camp, which was formerly the target of 
repeated Israeli artillery attacks. The citizens appealed to 
the concerned officials to comb the area to make sure there are 
no more unexploded shells. 
  Timor Goksel, the official spokesman for the UN Interim 
Force 
in Lebanon, announced that a soldier serving with the Fijian 
contingent died today of injuries sustained during a clash with 
Hizballah last Friday.

  [Text] In a statement he issued yesterday, South Lebanese 
Army Commander Major General Antoine Lahd dealt with what was 
called the stealing of water from the al-Litani and al-Wazzani 
rivers by Israel. He said: I do not know how a UN body like the 
Economic and Social Commission of West Asia, ESCWA, permitted 
itself to endorse a report of an official nature on a sensitive 
issue like the stealing of water by one state from another 
neighboring state--even though they are hostile to each 
other--without relying on tangible evidence and without 
conducting a direct field study to arrive at its conclusions. 
  Maj. Gen. Lahd affirmed that this is what the ESCWA has 
done. 
According to a statement by 'Umar Tuqan, the official 
responsible for the water program in ESCWA, to a BBC 
correspondent last Wednesday, it was content just to collect 
available reports and articles published by some magazines and 
newspapers on the issue of water in west Asian countries and 
then presented the results of its work to the member states 
without confirming the correctness of these reports and articles. 
  Maj. Gen. Lahd added: The Lebanese Government picked up this 
report and began clamoring about dangers that only exist in its 
imagination. This comes at a time when Lebanon is neglecting 
and overlooking a more serious danger, which is undermining 
Lebanon's sovereignty and threatening its very existence. 
  He asked: Doesn't the Lebanese Government have enough 
problems to worry about with regard to the economic situation, 
the suppression of liberties, and the domination of the nouveax 
riches and the angels of punishment? Or did it fabricate all 
this clamor in order to distract people's attention from other 
matters being cooked up in secret, something that constitute a 
real danger to Lebanon's entity and future? 
  Maj. Gen. Lahd concluded: How long will the Lebanese 
Government continue such lies, false heroism, and distraction of 
the people from the essence of matters?

London's extreme concern over the recent escalation of violence 
in the south, particularly in the wake of the Israeli raid 
against a Hizballah center near Ba'labakk. The embassy 
emphasized Britain's position, which fully supports the 
implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 425, and called 
for the restoration of the Lebanese Government's effective 
authority over all Lebanese territory.

  [Text] Cairo, 6 Jun (MENA) -- Today Arab League Secretary 
General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid received Haydar Abu-Bakr 
al-'Attas, head of the government recently announced in Aden. 
  In a statement after the meeting, al-'Attas said they 
discussed the current military escalation in Yemen and Sanaa's 
defiance of the UN Security Council's cease-fire resolution. He 
said that Sanaa's escalation of the situation in Yemen is 
manifested through the random shelling of economic installations 
in the south, such as the oil refinery in Aden that caused big 
fires to break out in it. This is in addition to the random 
shelling of residential areas, such as al-Shaykh Duwayl and 
al-Shaykh 'Uthman neighborhoods. 
  He added that fierce battles are currently taking place 
because of the offensive, which has been launched by the Sanaa 
forces against the south. He emphasized that "the people of the 
south are desperately defending their city." 
  Al-'Attas said that serious developments are currently 
taking 
place in Yemen. The first development is the issuance of a 
Muslim legal edict by Dr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Daylami, member of 
the higher committee of the Yemeni Reform Grouping, which is the 
third party in the government coalition, allowing the killing of 
children, women, and old people and ruling out a cease-fire in 
Yemen. Al-'Attas said that this edict expresses Sanaa's 
insistence to continue the war. 
  He said that the second serious development is Sanaa's 
refusal to accept the UN Security Council's cease-fire 
resolution, citing flimsy reasons to justify its decision. 
  Al-'Attas affirmed that the Arab League is currently 
intensifying its contacts and efforts to bring about a 
cease-fire and stop the bloodshed in Yemen. 
  Answering a question about the extent of international 
recognition achieved by the "Democratic Republic of Yemen," 
which was declared in Aden, al-'Attas said that recognition is 
not the first issue on the agenda. The first issue is stopping 
the bloodshed. Al-'Attas praised the statement Egypt issued 
today in support of the efforts to end the war between the north 
and south in Yemen. Al-'Attas described Egypt as "one of the 
main countries working to achieve peace and stability in Yemen." 
  Asked about Sanaa's claim that unity was established on the 
basis of a popular referendum, and therefore, the south has no 
right to dissolve this unity, al-'Attas said that the unity 
agreement was concluded by Yemeni leaders and not through a 
referendum. He added that the parliamentary elections, which 
took place on 27 April expressed the position of the south which 
rejects the north's view that it is the principal part and the 
south is a branch. The Yemeni Socialist Party retained all the 
seats in the southern constituencies.

and stop the bloodshed in compliance with Security Council 
Resolution No. 924.

  [Text] Cairo, 3 Jun (MENA) -- The 11th conference of the 
Nonaligned Movement's [NAM] foreign ministers concluded its 
sessions in Cairo today and issued a final document that 
included NAM's stand on political and economic developments and 
changes in the international situation. 
  The document included NAM's stand on issues of disarmament, 
international security and economic cooperation, the 
environment, development, South-South cooperation, human rights, 
social developments, regional issues, resolving conflicts, and 
UN reform. 
  The document stressed that the international situation 
remains "extremely fluid," shrouded in confusion, and 
characterized by a growing tendency toward focusing primarily on 
the interests and concerns of a limited number of advanced 
countries. 
  The NAM foreign ministers called in their final document for 
defining new priorities in the world order and for paying more 
attention to the principal development requirements and the need 
for reconciling the new criteria created in international 
relations to the cultural characters of developing countries. 
  The ministers stressed that the continuation of the problems 
connected with poverty, unemployment, developmental 
backwardness, illiteracy, environmental deterioration, 
terrorism, and the drug trade will result in political and 
social tensions and this in turn will negatively affect 
international peace and security. 
  The final document stressed the need for the contribution of 
the regional economic groupings to the achievement of the free 
flow of trade, investments, and technology across international 
borders and integrated commercial blocs. They expressed hope 
that these groupings will help establish and strengthen an open 
and energetic international trade order. 
  The ministers underlined the importance of the contacts that 
NAM has with all the advanced industrialized countries in order 
to expand the North-South dialogue while simultaneously 
strengthening South-South cooperation. 
  Regarding regional conflicts, the NAM foreign ministers 
stressed the need to strengthen the existing international 
mechanisms for resolving conflicts that have remained without a 
solution so far. The final document noted that the NAM 
Coordination Bureau [words indistinct]. It underlined the need 
to unify efforts for the sake of upholding tolerance as a solid 
concept in conducting international relations and as an 
indispensable factor in international behavior, in addition to 
being a principal concept in the UN Charter. 
  The document reaffirmed the importance of not marginalizing 
the role of countries that are continuing their endeavors to 
play a principal role in international affairs. It noted the 
need for the international organizations to effect fundamental 
changes in their structures so that they can react to the 
arising challenges that are imposed by the new international 
state of affairs. The NAM foreign ministers decided to boost 
their efforts to attain this objective. 
  The final document said the NAM foreign ministers discussed 
during their conference the role of their movement in light of 
changes that have recently taken place on international 
relations. 
  They confirmed once again the importance of enabling the 
continued operation of the movement and its follow-up of new 
international circumstances. 
  The final document clarified the concept of nonalignment 
which has embodied the hopes of mankind for comprehensive 
disarmament and the right to self-determination; guaranteed 
human rights, man's basic freedoms, and economic development; 
established an international economic system; and developed 
human resources and coexistence among the various regimes, 
cultures, and societies. 
  The document said that this is why the ministers decided to 
continue making efforts to give NAM greater effectiveness. 
  In this regard, the ministers welcomed the increase in the 
number of members in the Movement. They believe that this 
indicates there is continued interest in the role of NAM. 
  They affirmed that NAM should adopt a program that would 
enable it to absorb the wide-ranging interests of its members 
and the amendments that need to be introduced into the structure 
and methods of the movement. 
  The ministers recommended that relations between NAM and the 
Group of 77 should be strengthened. The developing countries' 
stands should also be advanced as a whole with the objective of 
bolstering their negotiations' strength with the progressive 
industrial states. 
  The ministers affirmed once again their firm belief that the 
United Nations is the most appropriate international authority 
for preserving international peace and security and for 
cooperation for development purposes. They praised the role of 
the team working on reorganizing and reforming the United 
Nations which was formed by the Jakarta summit. They stressed 
that the process of reforming the United Nations should take 
into consideration the important changes in international 
relations and should re-activate the role and duties of the 
General Assembly. 
  The ministers see a need for discussing the process of 
reforming the UN Security Council, modifying its structure, and 
increasing its members on democratic and geographic basis. NAM 
representation among the permanent members of the Security 
Council should be increased. 
  The ministers once again affirmed the need to conduct the 
Security Council's decision-making process more openly. In 
order to realize this objective, they urged the Security Council 
to convene a larger number of official and open sessions when 
discussing any issue and before making any decision. This would 
allow greater participation on the largest scale possible. 
  The ministers urged the Security Council to establish a 
basic 
system for regular and direct consultations with those countries 
contributing forces [to the United Nations] during the 
decision-making process with respect to setting up and 
administering the peacekeeping process. The ministers called 
for taking the appropriate measures that allow the non-members 
who are interested in participating in any mechanism, such as 
any special sub-committee the Council might form, to participate. 
  Affirming the importance of the UN peacekeeping operations, 
the ministers called on NAM to participate in drawing up guiding 
principles for the peacekeeping operations that would conform to 
the UN Charter and enable the United Nations to contribute more 
effectively toward consolidating world peace and security. The 
ministers demanded that all peacekeeping operations adhere to 
the principles of the UN Charter, have a non-interventionist 
character, and be negotiated at the request of the concerned 
member states. 
  The ministers affirmed the need for the peacekeeping 
operations to be non-discriminatory in character. They also 
demanded that complete openness and constant consultations be a 
main factor in the formation of the peacekeeping operations, 
which must have a clear mandate, a specific time frame, and 
guaranteed financing. Resolutions on the formation of these 
operations must include clauses pertaining to the safety of 
personnel. The ministers demanded equal opportunity to 
facilitate the widest possible participation of the member 
states, particularly the developing states, in the peacekeeping 
operations. 
  Regarding NAM's position on decolonization, the ministers 
reaffirmed the right of peoples in regions that do not enjoy 
autonomy to self-determination and independence, in accordance 
with UN General Assembly Resolution 1514 of 14 September 1961. 
They affirmed their absolute support for the work of the UN 
Decolonization Committee and its effective contribution to the 
implementation of the declaration on granting independence to 
colonized states and peoples. 
  Regarding disarmament and world security, the ministers 
reaffirmed the stand adopted by NAM in the final document of the 
Jakarta summit. They expressed the belief that total 
disarmament under effective international supervision remains a 
noble goal which must be achieved. They called for clearing the 
world of nuclear weapons and urged the disarmament conference to 
give priority to negotiations on an international agreement 
banning the use of nuclear weapons or the threat to use them. 
They urged the disarmament conference to work to conclude a 
comprehensive international treaty banning nuclear tests. They 
called on states that possess nuclear weapons to stop all 
experimental detonation of nuclear weapons until this treaty is 
concluded. 
  The ministers stressed that the creation of nuclear-free 
zones is a first necessary step to achieve the goal of 
eliminating the weapons of mass destruction. They welcomed UN 
General Assembly Resolution 48/71, adopted without a vote and 
dated 16 December 1993, calling for the creation of a 
nuclear-free zone in the Middle East. This ideas was first 
proposed by Egypt and Iran. The ministers praised and called 
for the implementation of President Husni Mubarak's initiative 
declaring the Middle East a zone free of weapons of mass 
destruction. They expressed the belief that the removal of 
nuclear weapons from the region will lead to the removal of 
weapons of mass destruction. They urged Israel to get rid of 
its nuclear weapons, to join the nuclear non-proliferation 
treaty, and to subject all its nuclear installations to the 
comprehensive safeguards of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency. The ministers welcomed the progress made in drafting a 
treaty or agreement declaring Africa a nuclear-free zone. They 
also welcomed Mongolia's 1992 declaration making its territory 
free of nuclear weapons. 
  On NAM's position on international economic cooperation, the 
ministers expressed the belief that it is necessary to 
adequately treat the usual problems of the world economy. The 
nonaligned states and other developing countries must contribute 
toward the formation of a new world economic order. They noted 
the low growth rate in the developing countries, the debt 
burdens, and the low prices of basic commodities. 
  The ministers stressed the need for coordination between the 
Caracas working program of the Group of 77 and NAM's working 
program for economic cooperation. A joint coordinating 
committee must consolidate relations between the two groups. 
  The ministers affirmed the importance of South-South 
cooperation as a basic factor in the efforts to reorganize 
international relations and as a vital tool to expedite 
development in the developing states. They asked the 
ministerial economic cooperation committee to give priority to 
discussing this issue and to submit its recommendations in this 
regard to NAM's 11th Summit Conference, which will discuss these 
recommendations and issue the appropriate resolutions. 
  The ministers called on the nonaligned countries and other 
developing countries to intensify and strengthen current efforts 
for South-South cooperation, to use new tangible forms and 
priorities for cooperation, and to adopt practical methods to 
implement this cooperation. 
  Concerning the GATT, the ministers stressed that developing 
nations should be accorded the benefits spelled out by 
preferential agreements and that they must be given appropriate 
financial and technological aid to be able to diversify their 
exports and compensate the direct losses they will suffer as a 
result of the liberalization of world trade. 
  The ministers announced that the agreements, rules, and new 
structures agreed on during GATT's Uruguay meeting must yield 
greater opportunities to the countries of the world, 
particularly developing countries, to reach new markets, expand 
world trade, raise incomes, and provide more jobs. 
  The ministers voiced concern about certain parties' tendency 
to circumvent the multinational structures for liberalizing 
trade which were agreed on during GATT's Uruguay meeting. They 
said this is done by exploiting environmental and social issues 
as pretexts for new forms of protectionism. 
  The ministers urged the developed countries to limit their 
coercive and unilateral economic measures against developing 
countries for political purposes. They also asked them not to 
impose political conditions on international cooperation. They 
called on the world community to adopt firm and effective 
measures to end such practices. 
  The ministers underlined their belief in facilitating and 
encouraging private sector business activities in view of the 
private sector's major role in promoting cooperation among the 
countries of the South. They expressed satisfaction at the 
implementation of the constituent treaty of the African economic 
group, seeing it as a step toward greater South-South 
cooperation. 
  The ministers again asserted that the international trade 
preferential system is an important method of strengthening and 
expanding trade among developing countries and urged the 
countries that have not yet signed this agreement to do so. 
  The ministers emphasized the United Nations' major role in 
promoting international cooperation for the sake of economic and 
social development. They welcomed the UN General Assembly's 
resolution calling for renewed dialogue among the world's 
nations to encourage development through partnership. They said 
that this dialogue is important for mutual interests and benefit. 
  The ministers called for canceling or at least reducing 
debts 
stemming from the developing countries' official debts and urged 
the prompt adoption of measures on the issue of the commercial 
debts that these countries owe. They urged multinational 
financial institutions to continue their current backing for the 
reduction of debts and the costs of servicing them and called 
for solutions to this problem that would help the economic 
development of countries that are facing tremendous difficulties 
in servicing their debt. 
  They called on creditor countries, private banks, and 
multinational financial institutions to extend new and suitable 
financial aid to developing debtor countries, particularly those 
with low or medium revenues that are burdened with debt. 
  The ministers urged holding a new international conference 
to 
finance development projects and expressed their worry about the 
low levels of financing offered for the economic development of 
poor countries. They called on the developed nations to allot 
0.7 percent of their gross national product for this type of 
financing. 
  The ministers stressed the importance of linkage between 
trade and currency issues and the need to improve the trade 
environment so that the developing nations can carry out their 
development plans. 
  They welcomed the Moroccan king's proposal to establish a 
high-level inter-governmental team to study new mechanisms for 
international economic negotiations and to promote greater 
cooperation with the IMF, the World Bank, and the World Trade 
Organization. 
  The ministers called on the United Nations to assume a major 
role in backing the developing nations' efforts to build up 
scientific and technological capabilities and said more 
opportunities must be given for them to acquire new technology 
with favorable conditions. They demanded that developed, 
industrial nations stop resorting to the restrictions they now 
use to limit the export of technology to developing countries. 
  The ministers welcomed the expanded cooperation program, 
adopted by the Nonaligned Movement's presidency, which will help 
organize a UN conference on human settlements in Turkey in 1996. 
  The ministers voiced grave concern over the continuing 
deterioration in global food and agricultural supplies, 
particularly in the developing world. They emphasized the 
Nonaligned Movement's advocacy of a prompt and concerted effort 
to solve the problem of hunger in the world. In this connection 
they welcomed the formation of an advisory team of experts on 
food security and approved the recommendations that this team 
made during its meeting in Jakarta in January 1994. 
  The ministers stressed the need to attach special attention 
to the critical economic conditions in Africa and voiced grave 
concern about the fact that numerous agreements on ways of 
handling this issue that were agreed upon at several 
international forums were not implemented. 
  The ministers voiced satisfaction with the immense progress 
made by some developing Asian and Pacific economies and the 
existing cooperation between those countries and other regional 
partners. 
  Concerning the Nonaligned Movement's stance on the 
environment and development problems, the ministers called for 
intense efforts to preserve the environment and reiterated their 
adherence to a balanced, integrated approach to development such 
as that which appeared in the Rio Declaration on the environment 
and development. They also stressed that states have a 
sovereign right to utilize their intrinsic resources according 
to their environmental and developmental policies and that these 
states should take care that their activities do not harm the 
environment of other countries or areas beyond their national 
jurisdiction. 
  The ministers expressed the hope that commitments to 
implementing the 21st century agenda concerning new and 
supplementary financial resources and technology transfer 
easily, as indicated by the Rio Declaration, will be honored. 
  The ministers also expressed the belief that the developing 
countries' financial and technological resources should be 
commensurate with their actual requirements. 
  The ministers emphasized the importance of the current 
negotiations to devise an international agreement to combat 
desertification, especially in Africa, and reiterated the G-77's 
stand on the need to set up a fund to implement the agreement. 
  The ministers approved the resolution adopted at the second 
conference of the Basel Accord, under which any cross-border 
transportation of toxic waste undertaken to get rid of such 
waste by the countries of the cooperation and economic 
development organization by dumping it in other countries that 
are not member states of that organization should be banned by 
1997. They also stressed the importance of devising new 
charters [word indistinct] to preserve and run fish stocks in 
overlapping areas and stocks of fish on the high seas. 
  The ministers noted that the developing countries' lack of 
adequate basic structures to prevent disasters and minimize 
their effects and the lack of relief structures made them the 
countries most affected by these disasters and they recommended 
that the nonaligned countries intensify cooperation in this 
field. 
  The ministers reaffirmed the importance of the UN Maritime 
Law Agreement to the [word indistinct] of the member states and 
stressed the need to ratify the agreement worldwide. 
  The ministers renewed their countries' commitment to their 
pledges to consolidate world respect, care, and protection of 
all human rights and everyone's basic freedoms according to the 
UN Charter. They emphasized that democracy provides an open 
system to protect and enhance human rights and expressed their 
deep concern about random massacres perpetrated in areas of 
armed conflict. 
  As regards human rights, the ministers reaffirmed that, 
although human rights are of a universal nature, they should be 
viewed by considering the importance of various national and 
regional characteristics and historical, cultural, and religious 
backgrounds. 
  The ministers reiterated that all forms of racism, social 
discrimination, new forms of racism, and hatred of foreigners 
constitute a grave violation of human rights and should be 
combated with all means. They expressed their profound concern 
over the emergence of stringent immigration policies in many 
developed countries imposing firm restrictions on people's 
movement and leading to hatred of foreigners. 
  The ministers affirmed that the right to development is 
universal and that the international community should support 
collective cooperation the achievement of which requires 
devising new, suitable development policies. 
  The ministers emphasized that terrorism is a violation of 
human rights and openly condemned all forms of terrorism. They 
stressed that sponsoring terrorism, allowing the use of a 
particular country for planning, organizing, provoking, or 
committing terrorist acts against other countries is a breach of 
the principles of the UN Charter. They urged the international 
community to enhance cooperation in combating the danger of 
terrorism anywhere, no matter who perpetrates such an act or who 
is subjected to it at national, regional, and world levels. 
  The ministers discussed the status of human rights in the 
provinces of the former Yugoslavia and stated that ethnic 
cleansing was the direct cause of the bulk of the grave and 
organized violations of human rights and that their primary 
victims are the Muslims who are threatened with 
near-annihilation. They urged all countries to adopt immediate 
measures to combat this odious practice and expressed concern at 
the continued violation of Muslims' human rights in Sanjaq and 
Kosovo. 
  As regards social development, the ministers reiterated that 
structural adjustment programs and foreign debts should not be 
allowed to have a negative effect on human development programs. 
They also affirmed the Nonaligned Movement's commitment to 
enhancing international cooperation in social development and 
stressed the need for national efforts and international 
cooperation to give priority to eliminating poverty, increasing 
productive labor, creating a suitable international social and 
economic climate to overcome the obstacles blocking economic and 
social development. 
  The ministers renewed the Movement's support for holding the 
fourth women's labor conference for equality, development, and 
peace, due to be held in Beijing in 1995. They decided to 
coordinate their efforts to devise a working program to expedite 
the removal of impediments blocking women's full participation 
in various fields. 
  The ministers reiterated that child rights require more 
protection and improvement. They called for consolidated 
efforts to improve conditions for children all over the world 
and expressed concern at critical conditions for children in 
many parts of the world as a result of improper social and 
economic circumstances, natural disasters, armed disputes, 
illiteracy, hunger, and disability. They condemned the 
exploitation of children in armed disputes and called on all NAM 
governments that have not as yet ratified the child rights 
agreement to do so as soon as possible. 
  The ministers suggested that member governments allocate 20 
percent of their budgets to human development, particularly to 
children, and called for urgent measures to prevent the 
exploitation of children in prostitution and the distribution of 
pornography, as well as the illicit trade in children, all of 
which are poisons that affect children, particularly in 
developing states. 
  The ministers noted that the heads of states and governments 
addressed an appeal during the Jakarta summit to all competent 
UN agencies to intensify efforts to work out a practical plan to 
develop youth. They called for setting a date to hold the UN 
General Assembly meeting on youth issues in 1995. 
  The foreign ministers voiced their deep concern at the risks 
involved in the abuse of and trade in drugs and at the mental 
influence of drugs that still undermines society's ethical and 
physical aspects and the life and future of new generations, 
particularly in view of the growing demand for drugs in 
developing countries. They drew attention to the growing links 
between drug traffickers and terrorists, which left a negative 
impact on peace and stability in different corners of the world. 
They called for coordinated and exhaustive international action 
that addresses the various aspects of the problem, including 
efforts to curb poverty and increase development aid to 
developing states to allow their inhabitants, particularly 
farmers and their families, to break free from the circle of 
drug dealing. 
  The NAM foreign ministers reiterated support for the 
principles of national sovereignty and noninterference in the 
internal affairs of other states. They noted that the issue of 
drug trafficking should not be turned into an instrument for the 
pursuit of political goals. They appealed to nonaligned and 
developing states to enhance cooperation in fighting drugs. 
  Touching on general political issues, the foreign ministers 
reiterated their support for the peace process that started with 
the Madrid conference to achieve a just, lasting, and 
all-embracing peace in the Middle East on the basis of UN 
Resolutions 242 and 338 and the land-for-peace principle. They 
recognized the significance of the Palestinian-Israeli 
Declaration of Principles signed on 13 September and the 
agreement signed in Cairo on 4 May, which represents a first 
step toward implementing that declaration. They also recognized 
the importance of the Jordanian-Israeli joint agenda, hoping to 
see urgent progress along the other tracks through Israel's 
compliance with the basic prerequisites of peace in the Middle 
East. 
  The NAM ministers reiterated that comprehensive peace in the 
Middle East must result in Israel's full withdrawal from all the 
Palestinian territories, including Jerusalem, from the Syrian 
Golan, from the Jordan territories occupied since 1967, and from 
the occupied Lebanese territories. They stressed that this 
peace should also result in endorsing the lawful national rights 
of the Palestinian people, primarily their right to 
self-determination on their national soil; providing guarantees 
for peace for all regional states within safe and 
internationally-recognized borders; and solving the problems of 
Palestinian refugees and Israeli settlements. The Iranian 
delegation objected to these two paragraphs. 
  Referring to UN Security Council Resolution 252, which calls 
on Israel to revoke all the measures that changed the legal 
status of the city of Jerusalem, the ministers reiterated that 
all the legislative and administrative measures Israel adopted 
as an occupation authority, particularly announcing Jerusalem as 
the capital of Israel, are null and void. They affirmed that 
the issue of Jerusalem cannot be resolved by unilateral measures. 
  The foreign ministers reiterated that the Israeli 
settlements 
in the Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since 
1967 are illegal, constitute a hurdle on the road to peace, and 
should be dismantled. 
  They once again emphasized the need to take sufficient 
measures to guarantee peace and protection for the Palestinians 
in the occupied territories. They called on Israel to take 
measures to facilitate the return of Palestinians deported since 
1967, to speed up the release of detained Palestinians, and to 
respect the basic freedoms of the Palestinian people. They 
stressed that all the measures Israel took to change the 
features and legal status of Syria's occupied Golan Heights are 
null and void and constitute a blatant violation of 
international law. 
  The ministers praised the recent positive developments in 
Lebanon represented by the continuing progress in the process of 
national reconciliation. They called for respect for Lebanon's 
independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. They 
condemned the continuing Israeli occupation of parts of southern 
Lebanon and western al-Biqa' Valley. They affirmed the need for 
the reconstruction of Lebanon. 
  The ministers reviewed the situation between Iraq and Kuwait 
and stressed that all NAM member states are committed to respect 
the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of both 
Kuwait and Iraq. They also emphasized that the full 
implementation of all the relevant UN Security Council 
resolutions constitutes the means of establishing peace, 
security, and stability in the region. They urged Iraq to 
confirm its recognition, clearly and unequivocally, of Kuwait's 
sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, and demarcated 
international borders by accepting Resolution 833, in order to 
create a positive climate, leading to security and stability in 
the region. 
  The ministers urged Iraq to complete the implementation of 
the relevant UN Security Council resolutions on the release of 
Kuwaiti detainees and the settlement of the issue of missing 
persons. The Iraqi delegation objected to this paragraph. 
  The ministers noticed the progress in the ongoing contacts 
between Iraq on the one hand and the Special Committee and the 
IAEA on the other with a view to implementing Paragraph C of 
Security Council Resolution 687. The ministers called for an 
end to human suffering in accordance with the relevant Security 
Council resolutions. The Iraqi delegation demanded that the 
words "of the Iraqi people" be entered after the words "human 
suffering." 
  Regarding Yemen, the ministers expressed their support for 
the ongoing efforts to solve the conflict through peaceful 
means, establish peace and stability, and resume the dialogue 
among the Yemeni parties, particularly Security Council 
Resolution 924/1994, including an immediate cessation of 
fighting, an end to supplies of arms and other military hardware 
which could contribute to continued fighting, and the dispatch 
of a fact-finding mission to the area, as soon as possible, to 
help resume the dialogue among the Yemeni parties. 
  The ministers affirmed that political differences cannot be 
settled by the use of arms. They urged all Yemeni parties to 
return immediately to the negotiating table so as to allow a 
peaceful resolution of their disputes, the restoration of peace 
and stability, and the safeguarding of the interests of the 
Yemeni people. This will positively contribute to maintaining 
peace in the whole region. The Yemeni delegation objected to 
this paragraph's non-mention of Yemeni unity. 
  Regarding Libya, the ministers welcomed Libya's acceptance 
of 
Security Council Resolution 731. They reaffirmed their hope 
that the concerned parties will find a peaceful and just 
settlement that will secure the interests and rights of all 
parties in accordance with international law and the principles 
of the UN Charter. They expressed their concern over the 
negative consequences of the continuation of the crisis on the 
Libyan people, the neighboring countries, and the whole region. 
  The ministers urged the parties concerned to refrain from 
any 
action that would result in escalation and to settle the crisis 
in a peaceful and speedy manner in accordance with Chapter 6 of 
the UN Charter. They welcomed Arab League Resolution 5373 
issued on 27 March 1994 and urged the Security Council to take 
into consideration the new proposal this resolution contains 
with a view to finding a peaceful and fair solution. 
  Regarding African issues, the ministers welcomed the OAU's 
establishment of a mechanism for the prevention, management, and 
resolution of conflicts in accordance with a resolution issued 
by the conference of the African heads of state and government 
held in Cairo in June 1993. They expressed the hope that the 
establishment of this pioneer mechanism would bring a new 
institutional dynamism to deal with conflicts in Africa. 
  The ministers welcomed South Africa's membership in the OAU 
and NAM. They wished the new republic a successful and 
prosperous future. They paid special tribute to President 
Nelson Mandela as a leader of stature commanding the respect of 
the international community and the confidence of the people of 
South Africa. They welcomed the UN Security Council resolution 
lifting the economic sanctions against South Africa. 
  The ministers welcomed the Addis Ababa agreement signed by 
all Somali factions on 27 March 1993. They praised the efforts 
of President Husni Mubarak in his capacity as OAU chairman and 
the efforts of Ethiopian President Meles Zenawi on behalf of the 
OAU to achieve national reconciliation in Somalia. The 
ministers agreed to explore the possibility of holding an 
international conference on Somalia. They urged the 
international community to adopt an effective and large-scale 
program for reconstruction and development in Somalia. 
  The ministers voiced extreme concern over the tragic 
conditions facing the Angolan people as a consequence of UNITA's 
[National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] refusal to 
accept the results of the September 1992 elections and its 
resumption of military actions, causing grievous loss of life 
and property damage. The ministers urged UNITA to accept 
unconditionally the results of the country's democratic 
elections and to negotiate with the government in good faith so 
that the current negotiations in Lusaka would produce an 
agreement capable of maintaining a lasting peace in Angola. 
They appealed to the world community to send prompt 
humanitarian aid to the residents of Angolan areas that have 
suffered war damage. 
  Regarding the Rwandan crisis, the ministers expressed 
profound regret over the tragic events there which have 
displaced or killed hundreds of thousands of people and created 
huge numbers of refugees. They urged an immediate halt to the 
violence and killings ravaging that country and called on the 
concerned parties to adopt a spirit of national reconciliation, 
end the violence, and form a new government. 
  The ministers appealed to the world community to send 
generous relief supplies and other humanitarian aid to the 
Rwandan people and refugees. They also called for additional 
economic, financial, and technical assistance to rebuild that 
country. 
  The ministers expressed their appreciation to the Burundian 
Government and people for their commitment to national 
reconciliation. They welcomed the formation of a state council 
and a new transitional government in Liberia on 7 March 1994, 
regarding this as a positive step toward stability in Liberia. 
  The ministers expressed solidarity with the Sierra Leonean 
Government's efforts to repulse the raids and rebellion of the 
United Revolutionary Front. They urged this government to 
continue its efforts to put a quick end to the rebellion. 
  The ministers praised the recent positive achievements in 
Mozambique illustrated by the implementation of the peace 
agreement between the Mozambican Government and Renamo 
[Mozambique National Resistance]. 
  They also welcomed the Libyan-Chadian agreement to adhere to 
[the international ruling on] the Aouzou Strip. 
  They reiterated the Nonaligned Movement's support for the UN 
efforts to organize a referendum in the Western Sahara. 
  As for the Korean crisis, the ministers expressed concern 
over the continued partition of the Korean peninsula and voiced 
support for the Korean people's efforts to reunite their 
country. They noted the importance of maintaining peace and 
security in the peninsula for the sake of the Korean nation's 
prosperity. They expressed hope that the Korean nuclear issue 
would be settled peacefully by way of negotiations and dialogue. 
  Concerning Afghanistan, the ministers expressed concern over 
the fighting there and appealed to the Afghan leaders to observe 
an immediate and unconditional cease-fire, settle their 
differences by peaceful dialogue, and form a stable government 
on the basis of free and fair elections. 
  As to the Latin American region, the ministers acknowledged 
that this region has effectively participated in nonaligned 
activities and that its contributions to the shaping of a new 
world order are indispensable. 
  Regarding Bosnia-Herzegovina the ministers welcomed the 
agreements recently signed in Washington between the Bosnian and 
Croatian leaders and expressed hope that further positive steps 
will be made. They voiced concern over the acts of 
extermination and ethnic cleansing against the people of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and affirmed that the UN Security Council 
should impose a total halt to fighting all over that country. 
  The conference adopted a resolution calling for respect for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The 
resolution called for holding a UN-sponsored international 
conference on Bosnia-Herzegovina to attain a cease-fire and 
declare the entire country a safe haven.

Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) meeting in Cairo has unanimously 
adopted Malaysia's proposal that an international conference be 
held on Bosnia-Herzegovina, Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad 
Badawi said Friday [3 June]. 
  This is the first time that a large organisation like NAM 
has 
formally adopted our proposal to promote and initiate the 
hosting of the international conference, he said in a telephone 
interview from here. 
  With the agreement, it means that NAM, which has 108 
members, 
is prepared to make efforts to hold the conference which has all 
along been only proposed by several other parties. 
  Abdullah is happy with the support given to Malaysia by 
heads 
of delegation when the proposal was discussed on Wednesday. 
  He said that the contact group of the Islamic Conference 
Organisation (IOC) had also expressed support for Malaysia's 
proposal that NAM initiate the hosting of the international 
conference. 
  The agreement was reached at the group's informal meeting 
where the Bosnian delegates gave a briefing on the latest 
situation in their country. 
  The group had also discussed matters to be included in the 
NAM's final document on Bosnia-Herzegovina, he said.

  [Text] Cairo, 3 Jun (MENA) -- The 11th conference of the 
Nonaligned Movement's [NAM] foreign ministers currently being 
held in Cairo has issued a resolution on Rwanda, urging the UN 
Security Council to quickly take all the necessary measures to 
immediately end the massacres taking place in Rwanda and to 
effectively provide all the necessary means for the deployment 
of peace keeping forces there as soon as possible. 
  The resolution, passed at the conclusion of the foreign 
ministers meetings today, also urges the international community 
to respond to the peaceful and humanitarian efforts being made 
in Rwanda by providing the material and financial resources and 
extending all practical assistance to ensure the immediate 
containment of pollution and the dangers to public health and 
the environment resulting from the human massacres taking place 
in Rwanda. 
  The resolution expresses the NAM's support for a roundtable 
with the participation of all the parties to the conflict. It 
calls for drawing up an action plan for the reconstruction and 
rehabilitation of Rwanda. 
  The resolution appeals to the international community not to 
delay in supporting the good initiative by Kenyan President 
Daniel arap Moi, which calls for a minisummit of the countries 
bordering Rwanda to be held in Nairobi early next week to 
discuss this issue.

  [Text] Cairo, 3 Jun (MENA) -- The Nonaligned Movement's 
foreign ministers conference has condemned the Israeli air raids 
on south Lebanon. In a resolution passed today, the conference 
stresses its complete solidarity with the Lebanese Government 
and people, and support for Lebanon in defending its sovereignty 
by all available means. 
  The conference calls on the UN Security Council and the 
cosponsors of the peace conference in the Middle East, "the 
United States and Russia" to move immediately to put an end to 
Israeli aggression, which is against the UN Charter and is 
designed to torpedo the peace process. The resolution calls for 
saving the peace process from collapse. 
  The resolution expresses the nonaligned conference's concern 
over the Israeli acts of aggression against Lebanese towns and 
villages. It said that the new massacre committed by Israel and 
previous kidnappings and acts of terror are no doubt intended to 
torpedo the peace process. 
  Hisham Dimashqiyah, Lebanese ambassador in Cairo and head of 
the Lebanese delegation to the nonaligned conference, delivered 
a speech at the conference. He said that by its repeated acts 
of aggression against south Lebanon Israel is violating 
Lebanon's sovereignty and defying the peace process. He called 
on the conference to pass a resolution strongly condemning 
Israeli aggression and stressing solidarity with the Lebanese 
people in defending their sovereignty by all available means. 
  The foreign ministers and heads of delegations of Syria, 
Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Palestine, Morocco, and Yemen 
delivered speeches in which they expressed support for Lebanon 
and called on the conference to pass an unequivocal resolution 
condemning Israeli aggression against south Lebanon. They also 
stressed that they support the Lebanese authorities efforts to 
extend their control throughout Lebanon. 
  Dimashqiyah told MENA that the Israeli aggression against 
Lebanon will impact negatively on the peace process in the 
Middle East, particularly the Lebanese track. 
  Responding to a question on Lebanon's intention to freeze 
the 
peace talks' Lebanese-Israeli track, Dimashqiyah said that 
freezing the negotiations may happen afer consultations among 
the higher Lebanese authorities, the Government, and the Chamber 
of Deputies. He said that the current Israeli air raids on 
Lebanon are part of a series of recurring acts of aggression, 
along with kidnappings of citizens and other air raids that kill 
and wound dozens of Lebanese. He said that the Lebanese Army is 
in a state of alert to repulse any aggression in cooperation 
with the Syrian forces operating in Lebanon. He noted that 
Israel uses any provocations or clashes on the border as a 
pretext to launch acts of aggression deep inside Lebanese 
territory, not just provocations in areas at the borders.

  [Text] Cairo, 3 Jun (MENA) -- The Nonaligned Movement's 
foreign ministers 11th conference devoted much of its final 
session to the issue of the Israeli raids against south Lebanon. 
Several foreign ministers and delegation heads addressed the 
session on this subject. 
  Head of the Lebanese delegation Hisham Dimashqiyah remarked 
that yesterday's Israeli aggression against the country 
constitutes a declaration of war. He warned that the peace 
process is endangered and that the UN Security Council and the 
United States and Russia, the two sponsors of the peace 
conference, must put pressure on Israel. 
  Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' said that the Israeli 
aggression against Lebanon is not directed against one 
particular country but against the entire world community and 
the cosponsors of the peace conference. He added that this is 
not the first such aggression and will not be the last and that 
Israel's repeated assaults on the Arab parties participating in 
the peace process illustrate the Israeli design to ruin the 
peace process and smother the opportunity to attain peace. 
  Head of the Egyptian delegation Nabil al-'Arabi emphasized 
his country's backing for Lebanon and its support for a 
comprehensive and just Middle East peace. He said Israel must 
halt these acts, which threaten the peace operation and 
contravene international law. He pointed out that peacemaking 
needs a favorable climate and the attack on Lebanon posed a 
threat to the Lebanese nation. 
  The head of the Saudi delegation said he adds his voice to 
that of the other delegation heads in expressing profound 
concern and strong condemnation of the Israeli aggression 
against Lebanon. He stressed that Saudi Arabia supports the 
Lebanese people and wants the peace process to continue. He 
urged that UN Security Council Resolution 425, which provides 
for Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon, be implemented. 
  PLO Political Department head Faruq Qaddumi accused Israel 
of 
deceiving the world. He said what is really happening between 
Israel and Palestine now is a new form of battle which, although 
it involves no violence, is a fresh stage of struggle. 
  Qaddumi added that Israel's acts of piracy in Lebanon, such 
as its abduction of Lebanese citizens, prove that it does not 
seek peace but is persisting in its efforts to derail the peace 
process. He said regional peace is still far away. 
  The head of the Libyan delegation reiterated support for 
Lebanon, condemned Israel, and urged the Security Council, the 
United States, and Russia to intervene to salvage the peace 
operation. 
  The Yemeni and Moroccan foreign ministers also declared 
support for Lebanon.

[NAM] foreign ministers conference issued a resolution today 
ending the work of the NAM committee on South Africa and 
submitting a recommendation to this effect to the movement's 
countries and governments leaders for ratification. 
  The conference said in its final session that this 
resolution 
is based on the start of a new stage in the history of South 
Africa following the holding of the first democratic elections 
there and the formation of a nonracial government. 
  It noted that the resolution is in line with the report 
presented by Indonesia's special envoy Nanasutrisna [name as 
received], who chaired the NAM session and who called for ending 
the work of the committee in light of these developments.

<F P=106> [Report by Hamdan al-Hajj] </F>
  [Text] Amman -- Dr. Fayiz al-Tarawinah, chief of the 
Jordanian delegation to the Jordanian-Israeli peace talks, has 
said that today's meeting of the Jordanian-U.S.-Israeli economic 
committee aims at getting acquainted with the stands of the 
Israeli side vis-a-vis the topics on the Jordanian agenda signed 
on 14 September. In a telephone interview conducted by 
AL-DUSTUR, Dr. al-Tarawinah said: We will not concede any of our 
rights. We want to make progress and achieve a qualitative step 
forward in the talks in accordance with the agenda and the point 
of reference for the peace process. The principles and 
constants will remain unchanged, and we will continue to adhere 
to the principle of comprehensive solution. 
  Dr. al-Tarawinah, who is also Jordan's ambassador in 
Washington, noted that the achievement of or failure to achieve 
progress in these talks depends on what the Israeli side will 
present, particularly since the Jordanian stands are declared 
and firm and we have Jordanian and Arab rights to which we 
adhere. 
  The chief Jordanian delegate added: Jordan's stand vis-a-vis 
the bilateral and multilateral talks has always been clear and 
candid. We reduced the Jordanian participation in the peace 
talks and our condition to return to the talks was to lift the 
siege of al-'Aqabah. Now that this issue has ended and the 
American side has announced its agreement on the Jordanian 
proposals to this effect -- except for some administrative and 
formal problems -- nothing now prevents the participation in and 
return to these talks, especially since Jordan has not suspended 
its participation in the multilateral talks but set conditions 
for its return. 
  Dr. al-Tarawinah noted that the return to the 
Jordanian-Israeli bilateral talks is also based on Jordan's 
adherence to and linkage with the concept of comprehensive 
solution, particularly since this includes comprehensive 
Jordanian and Arab rights. Jordan has its own issues and rights 
and now it is time to move toward the Jordanian facts, 
constants, and pillars. These Jordanian rights are part of the 
Arab rights and issues. 
  The joint tripartite committee, which will hold its first 
meeting today, 6 June, comes after the last round [of bilateral 
talks] which was held last February. The Jordanian delegation, 
which is led Dr. al-Tarawinah, also includes Michel Marto, 
deputy of the Central Bank of Jordan; Dr. Safwan Tuqan, 
secretary general of the Planning Ministry; and Dr. Mundher 
Haddadin, chief of the Jordanian delegation to the water 
committee in the multilateral talks.

  [Text] The economic talks in the Jordan--U.S.-Israeli 
forum will continue today. Our Washington correspondent Arye 
Golan reports that although the atmosphere in the talks is good 
and positive, no agreements have yet been reached. Israeli 
sources said that part of the talks -- pertaining to the 
demarcation of the road from Jordan to Egypt via Israel -- may 
be relocated to the region. Israel claims that the marking and 
measuring work could be used to demarcate the border between the 
two countries, an issue which Jordan would like to tackle 
already at this point. It was further reported that the United 
States may be involved in the paving of this road.

  [Text] Khartoum, 6 Jun (MENA)--An official Sudanese source 
admitted today that an Egyptian irrigation delegation was 
recently denied entry to Sudan. The source justified this by 
saying the delegation came to Khartoum on its own initiative, 
not at the invitation of the Sudanese Government. 
  Sudan had invited irrigation experts in Egypt to discuss a 
number of cooperation projects between the two countries, but it 
did not allow the delegation to enter and gave no reason. The 
delegation returned on the same plane. 
  It is known that Sudan recently seized a number of buildings 
where Egyptian irrigation engineers lived in the Sudanese 
capital.

  [Text] Rabat, Jun. 06 (MAP) -- The newly-appointed Moroccan 
Premier Abdellatif Filali will partially reshuffle the present 
cabinet, 'AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT' daily Monday reported. Such a 
hypothesis is plausible, because Filali did not ask leaders of 
political parties to participate in the future government, 
during his consultations with these parties last week, the daily 
explained. 
  According to the daily, Filali expressed during the 
consultations some ideas on a government of national consensus, 
the consolidation of dialog between the government and the 
parliament and proposed a political and social truce to pave the 
way for a coming phase in which the opposition can participate 
in the government, the daily added. The newly-appointed premier 
confirmed to political parties that he will work for the 
consolidation of the role of the prime minister which means, 
according to 'AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT', that Filali will actually 
assume all his tasks as premier. Filali will propose the list 
of the new cabinet to King Hassan II next Wednesday, the daily 
said. 
  Leaders of opposition parties, namely those of the Istiqlal 
Party and the Socialist Union of Popular Forces had told the 
daily that they would not participate in the Filali government 
and expressed a reserved optimism as to the possibility to open 
up the channels of `a different dialog' between the government 
and the opposition. 
  The daily said that the opposition parties will present a 
joint memorandum to Filali expressing their viewpoint on the 
questions raised during the consultations.

<F P=106> [Interview with 'Umar al-Muntasir, secretary of the Libyan </F>
General People's Committee for External Liaison and 
International Cooperation (foreign minister), by Sawsan 
Abu-Husayn in Cairo; date not given] 
  [Text] [Abu-Husayn] Do you believe there are on the 
horizon encouraging signs of a peaceful solution to the 
Lockerbie crisis? 
  [Al-Muntasir] The Lockerbie crisis will be resolved 
peacefully. There is no alternative. It is difficult to set a 
date for that now. But we are seeking to achieve it as soon as 
possible. What remains now is to agree on the foundations for a 
solution with the Western parties within the framework of some 
points proposed by the Arab League. I spoke with Arab League 
Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid on the sidelines of 
the Nonaligned Movement [NAM] conference and agreed that the 
seven-member committee should convene after the African summit 
scheduled to be held in Tunis within days. We will discuss the 
two resolutions adopted by the NAM and the African conference 
and ways of implementing them, especially as NAM ministers 
welcomed Libya's acceptance of Security Council Resolution 731 
and stressed the need for the parties concerned to secure a just 
settlement that safeguards all interests in accordance with 
international law and the principles of the UN Charter. 
Furthermore, the international community and its organizations 
are showing solidarity with us vis-a-vis the negative results 
caused by the embargo imposed on the country. This is why there 
is an inclination to urge the Security Council to take account 
of the Arab League's new proposal. 
  [Abu-Husayn] On what basis are the Western parties 
responding to a peaceful solution with Libya? 
  [Al-Muntasir] There is a Western inclination to ignore a 
peaceful solution with Libya, especially as its moderate policy 
no longer threatens world security and peace. It is always 
trying to find a just way out that meets commitment to 
international laws. Best proof of this is Libya's full 
withdrawal from the Aozou strip [Chad], even though this is not 
in Libya's interests. That is, we lost the legal case but 
preferred to fully respect the court's decision, while we see 
the major states advocating international legitimacy and yet 
they refuse to comply with it in numerous cases. 
  [Abu-Husayn] What about the status of your relations with 
Chad at present? 
  [Al-Muntasir] Relations with Chad and between the two 
peoples are deep-rooted, and there are numerous common interests 
to which brother leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi and President Deby 
will devote their interest in the stage ahead. I have 
assurances that they [relations] will move toward the better 
from now on, contrary to what some people expect. 
  It is worth noting here that NAM ministers described the 
agreement concluded between the Republic of Chad and the Libyan 
Arab Jamahiriyah on the implementation of the International 
Court of Justice's decision as a positive contribution to 
reinforcing the NAM's unity. 
  [Abu-Husayn] What about the Security Council? Will it take 
account of this commitment by Libya and thus allow the gradual 
lifting of the embargo imposed on your country, especially as it 
allowed UN observers to use planes to travel to the Aozou strip? 
  [Al-Muntasir] That step is regarded as a good precedent in 
the United Nations, and we hope it will be a good gesture and a 
good start for further steps toward lifting the embargo on 
Libya. I personally am optimistic in this connection. 
  [Abu-Husayn] The African summit will be held in the 
Tunisian capital in a few days. Has Libya submitted a request 
to the United Nations to allow Libyan President Mu'ammar 
al-Qadhdhafi to use his plane to fly to Tunis? 
  [Al-Muntasir] We will participate in the proceedings of the 
African summit. But so far we have not submitted a request to 
exempt the brother leader from the blockade. I believe that it 
is difficult for him to participate in the proceedings of any 
international conferences until the blockade has been lifted on 
the country. But as a Libyan citizen, he can go to Egypt and 
Tunisia through well-known means, namely by land. 
  [Abu-Husayn] What issue will Libya include on the Tunis 
summit's agenda? 
  [Al-Muntasir] The Lockerbie issue is our main issue. It 
will be raised in the framework of the demand for lifting the 
blockade, taking account of the NAM resolution and the Arab 
League's resolution. 
  [Abu-Husayn] What is your impression of the NAM proceedings' 
results? 
  [Al-Muntasir] I think the movement is destined to continue, 
especially as the recent conference was more positive with 
regard to correcting some conditions -- which will nudge it in 
the direction it was following in the days of Presidents 
al-Nasir, Nehru, and Tito. 
  [Abu-Husayn] A final question about Yemen: What about the 
Libyan position, especially after the resolution adopted by the 
Security Council? 
  [Al-Muntasir] Libya has announced its position from the 
outset, namely to safeguard Yemen's unity and declare a 
cease-fire. Because unity cannot be achieved by force or by 
arms. We believe that a halt to the fighting is fundamental in 
order to safeguard unity. President al-Qadhdhafi's contacts 
with President 'Abdallah Salih and 'Ali Salim al-Bid are moving 
in that direction, in order to safeguard Yemen's unity. 
  [Abu-Husayn] Will you recognize the southern state? 
  [Al-Muntasir] We are talking about unity. 
  [Abu-Husayn] What are the latest developments in the Libyan 
position on the peaceful settlement in the Middle East? Do you 
still reject the Gaza-Jericho agreement? 
  [Al-Muntasir] We do not reject the peace agreement in the 
Middle East. We object to Israel's noncompliance with the peace 
process and demand that the international community adopt just 
stands on its policy toward the Arab states and its daily and 
organized aggression on Lebanon and in the other occupied Arab 
territories in the West Bank and the Golan. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The General People's Committee for Justice and 
General Security announces that a process to compile and

  The General People's Committee for Justice and General 
Security also announces that the process to compile and register 
names of foreigners residing in the Great Jamahiriyah has begun.

No. 3, 1423 [after the Prophet's birth] concerning people's 
committees, and Article Four of the Security and Police Law. 
  Based on that, all foreigners living in the Great 
Jamahiriyah 
are requested to head to local popular security centers in their 
place of residence to implement these procedures. 
  All measures related to any of them performing any 
professional, handicraft, or trade activities, or continuing to 
work for general popular sectors will be stopped if they do not 
present proof or registration in the authorized security center. 
In addition, they will be subject to other punishments outlined 
by legislation in force. 
  The last date for registration is the end of the month of 
Hanibal, 1423.

[passage omitted: gang specialized in various crimes, areas 
where it was active] 
  The gang used stolen money to buy houses that were used as 
hideouts in various areas of the country, the same source said.

  [Excerpts] Tunis, 7 Jun (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa 
has stated that Egypt stands by Yemen's unity, noting that this 
unity cannot be preserved by shedding more blood. He said Egypt 
supports international and Arab legitimacy in this and other 
issues. 
  In an interview with the Tunisian newspaper AL-RA'Y AL-'AMM 
today, Musa said fear of Arabizing or internationalizing the 
Yemeni crisis should not be a justification for the Arabs to sit 
with their hands tied without working to stem the bloodshed in 
fraternal Yemen. 
  He added that the fear of Arabizing the crisis is not a 
justification for an indifferent stand which some are asking us 
to adopt and leave the brothers fight each other. He went on: 
We had feared Arabizing and internationalizing the crisis in 
the Gulf and are now doing the same thing as if we are invited 
to let Arab blood spill all the time. [passage omitted] 
  On the $275-billion African debts, Musa emphasized the need 
to repay them according to schedules leading to the revival of 
African economies. He urged the industrial nations to set an 
annual percentage to help development processes in African 
states reach the international target figure of 0.7 per cent of 
the gross national product. He noted that this percentage 
barely reaches 0.3 despite these countries' pledges in various 
international forums. 
  The foreign minister said Egypt has put forth several 
proposals to the OAU, including one on the need to adopt 
specific measures urging the international community to help 
resolve the African debt problem.

  [Text] Cairo, 6 Jun (MENA)--The northern al-Jizah 
Prosecution Office continued its interrogation of Muslim 
Brotherhood General Guide Hamid Abu-al-Nasr today. After four 
hours of questioning, the prosecution decided to resume the 
interrogations Thursday. 
  Abu-al-Nasr told his interrogators that the Muslim 
Brotherhood has had no official or structural organization since 
the decision to dissolve it in 1954. He said he is assuming the 
post of the group's general guide to shoulder his responsibility 
in filing lawsuits demanding that the dissolution decision be 
repealed. He noted that this is currently being examined by the 
judiciary. 
  Abu-al-Nasr said that as a general guide he issues 
statements 
expressing the Muslim Brotherhood's views on various issues. He 
stressed that he respects the Constitution and the laws and that 
he expresses his opinion through legitimate means allowed by law.

  [Text] Cairo, 6 Jun (MENA)--Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi 
has decided to refer four police officers to the Higher State 
Prosecution Office for interrogation for selling arms from the 
Interior Ministry arms depots. These officers are Major Samir 
Mahmud Mujahid, chief of the arms depot at the General 
Administration for Police Supply; Major Hani Sabri Mahmud, chief 
of the Returned Arms Department at the same administration; 
Major Mustafa 'Ashur, depots secretary at the Central Security 
Department; and Captain Iyhab Nafi', head of the Department of 
Returned Arms at the police supply. 
  The Interior Ministry statement released today said that the 
four officers sold five Lee Enfield rifles, three automatic 
rifles, and a quantity of rounds to certain arms and ammunition 
dealers. The investigating agencies continue their efforts to 
seize other quantities of arms and ammuntion that were sold with 
the knowledge of the four officers. 
  The interior minister earlier pensioned off the four 
officers 
as soon as their involvement in this operation was uncovered. 
It should be recalled that the interior minister issued 
directives for periodic inspection of the arms and ammunition 
depots to make sure that the regular instructions on the 
handling of various arms were implemented.

<F P=106> [Article by chief editor Mahfuz al-Ansari: "Al-Turabi's </F>
Infernal Scheme: Water and the Approach to the Forbidden 
Target"] 
  [Text] It is clear that a secret, central, and binding 
decision to "poison" relations with Egypt and block all attempts 
to mend them is guiding Sudan's policy. 
  It is also clear that the decision came out of "the 
government's dark room" chaired and administered by "Imam 
Ayatollah Ruhollah [name as published] Hasan al-Turabi...!", the 
regime's spiritual leader, leader of the National Islamic Front 
[NIF], and member of the international organization of the 
"political Islam" movement. 
  The decision made by the "dark room" is binding on the 
Government, whose executive seat is filled by Lieutenant General 
'Umar al-Bashir and his comrades, officers of the National 
Salvation Movement that toppled al-Sadiq al-Mahdi's regime. 
  A clever cunning characterizes the way the objectives are 
chosen and the way in which the decisions are made and 
implemented. The "Imam Shaykh Hasan" possesses cleverness and 
cunning in ample measure. His tactics depend on choosing the 
right moment to focus on certain objectives that are 
increasingly vital. 
  The tactics are also marked by targeting acknowledged 
sanctities and the rules and principles that have historically 
safeguarded Egyptian-Sudanese ties. 
  These tacticians do not take into account--nor do they even 
care at all--whether these decisions harm the interests of the 
Sudanese people themselves. 
  Al-Turabi is pressing ahead toward "forbidden" goals, always 
challenging the "taboo." 
  The latest decision made inside the "shaykh's dark room," 
with which Lt. Gen. al-Bashir's "administration" complied, was 
to seize 30 posts owned by the Egyptian Irrigation Ministry in 
Khartoum, in the al-Shajarah area south of Omdurman, and other 
installations. This was a first step toward a greater and more 
important goal, namely the Nile observation posts on the Blue 
Nile, White Nile, Subat, 'Atbarah, al-Rusayris Dam, and Malakal 
areas. These Egyptian outposts are in Sudan on the strength of 
treaties, agreements, and international laws regulating the use 
of jointly owned rivers, observing their progress, securing the 
water resources, and distributing the water. 
  This tactical progress toward the "forbidden" goal, carried 
out step by step by the "Imam" and his dark room is a blatant 
encroachment on the Nile water and Egypt's share of it. This 
objective cannot be concealed by the Sudanese Government's 
disingenuous media explanations made after the seizure of the 
Egyptian irrigation posts. 
  While the Sudanese media tried to cover up the recent 
seizure 
of Egyptian posts with feeble pretexts, Sudanese Irrigation 
Minister Ya'qub Abu-Shura announced that "Sudan's share of the 
[High Aswan] Dam water according to the 1959 agreement between 
Egypt and Lt. Gen. 'Abbud [Sudanese leader 1958-1964] does not 
satisfy Sudan's needs and therefore the agreement must be 
revised." 
  The facts contradict these statements, which remain a mere 
excuse for disputes and confrontations. The facts, which 
neither the Sudanese irrigation minister nor Lt. Gen. al-Bashir, 
nor for that matter the spiritual leader "Ayatollah al-Turabi," 
can deny are the following: 
  --Since 1992, Sudan has refused to hold a meeting of the 
Higher Joint Technical Nile Water Committee. According to 
existing agreements, this committee must meet every six months, 
in Sudan and Egypt alternately. This intentional suspension of 
the committee's functions has brought consultation, discussion, 
and cooperation to a halt. 
  --Sudan uses only 4 billion cubic meters of its annual 18- 
billion-meter share of the Nile River water. Although no one is 
preventing it from doing so, it is not equipped to use the rest 
of its share. It simply cannot use it all. 
  --Sudan informed Egypt some time ago that it planned to 
raise 
the height of the al-Rusayris Dam and increase its holding 
capacity by an additional 4 billion cubic meters. Egypt did not 
object, but said "Go ahead with God's blessing." 
  Sudan came back and said it needed more electric power and 
planned to build a reservoir called al-Hamdab Reservoir in the 
town of Murrah north of Khartoum. Egypt again did not object 
and Sudan hired a Russian company to carry out feasibility 
studies at a cost of $30 million. 
  Returning to the facts, we refer to the "High Dam" 
agreement with Sudan of 1959. Before the dam was built, Egypt's 
water quota, as agreed upon with the Nile basin states, was 48 
billion cubic meters. Sudan's quota was 4 billion cubic meters. 
  The High Dam studies, before and after the project was 
carried out, proved that the amount of water added by the dam is 
31 billion cubic meters, of which 10 cubic meters evaporates per 
year, between one flood and the next. The remaining added 
amount is thus 21 billion cubic meters, which Egypt requested be 
shared equally between itself and Sudan. But Sudan objected, 
requesting that it get two-thirds to Egypt's one-third--that is, 
14 billion cubic meters for Sudan and 7 billion for Egypt. 
Egypt's annual share of the Nile waters would thus become 55 
billion cubic meters. 
  The same facts show that Egypt undertook full responsibility 
for building the dam. It even compensated Sudan for the lands 
that were submerged by the waters of Lake Nasir. This means 
that Egypt undertook full financial responsibility for the dam 
and compensated Sudan in order to obtain 7 billion cubic meters 
of the Nile waters. Sudan, which paid none of the dam's cost, 
gets 14 cubic meters. 
  Egypt was not naive or helpless in doing that. Rather, it 
was responding to the eternal fact in which it believes and on 
which it acts--that there is no difference between the northern 
and southern parts of the valley and that the sons of the north 
are brothers of those of the south. 
  These are some, but not all, of the facts that depict the 
relationship and its nature in one of its numerous aspects--that 
pertaining to the Nile and water. 
  What does "Imam Shaykh" Dr. Hasan al-Turabi want, he and the 
"executive authority" which puts the decisions he makes in his 
"dark room" into effect, without pausing to consider the risks 
they involve or their different, fabricated, and even "suspect" 
nature? 
  It seems that "Shaykh Dr. Imam Hasan" is spoiling for a 
fight; he is seeking a "fight" with Egypt. 
  The man leaves no "well" without poisoning its water, even 
if 
the only one drinking from that well are the Sudanese people 
themselves. He did it with the Egyptian schools in Sudan, in 
which brother Sudanese were getting their educations. He did it 
in the name of Sudanization, as though this Sudanization is a 
creed, a religion, or a language. 
  He did it the day he decided to seize the branch of Cairo 
University in Khartoum and sequestered its buildings and all its 
contents. That university was originally established to serve 
the brothers there. He did it when he turned to the diplomatic 
representation and decided to close the Egyptian consulates in 
al- Ubayyid and Port Sudan. 
  Before that, he tried to change the international borders 
unilaterally the day he acted in Hala'ib as though it was purely 
Sudanese territory. He invited Canadian and Japanese companies 
to go there and prospect for oil. He did it the day he expelled 
the workers of the Egyptian Manganese Company and closed the 
company's doors. 
  This line of conduct, these incidents, and the approach 
al-Turabi and his executive apparatus, as represented by the 
lieutenant general's government, appear frivolous. But a second 
look reveals bigger and more serious dimensions. The closure of 
schools, universities, the Nile observatory stations, the 
Egyptian Irrigation Ministry's rest houses, and the consulates, 
plus the earlier attempt to create a border dispute that would 
develop into a military or semimilitary confrontation, all fall 
under the same category and have one goal: To sever all 
Egyptian-Sudanese links, provoke hatred and malice in the hearts 
of the people in the northern and southern parts of the valley 
instead of love, amity, and understanding, and to arouse 
Sudanese public opinion and steer it toward a big external 
target involving dignity and identity in schools and 
universities; the national soil of the homeland in Hala'ib and 
Shalatayn; and life and livelihood, as represented in the Nile 
waters. 
  Al-Turabi's mobilization is done in a tactical and 
escalatory manner. He chooses one specific target after the 
other and picks the time he deems fit to carry out his internal, 
regional, and external schemes. After that, the stage will be 
set for his grand scheme, which will come through a major and 
more serious adventure. He tried to start this adventure the 
day Khartoum attempted to act unilaterally in Hala'ib, 
concluding an exploration contract and expelling Egyptian 
personnel there. My guess is that in his calculations and 
estimates, al-Turabi thought then that Egypt would get mad and 
declare an all-out war, but he was disappointed. As a result, he 
resorted to "tactical measures" with the apparent view of 
"provoking" Egypt to act irrationally, such as Sudanizing 
schools, terminating the presence of Egyptian universities, 
closing down consulates, and seizing the headquarters and houses 
of the Irrigation Ministry. Such "tactical measures" are, I 
believe, outdated. Today, he is heading for his major 
adventure. As is known, playing with fire is a dangerous thing. 
Playing with fire approaches the "taboos" that concern the 
lives of others. In our context, it means the Nile and its 
water. Al-Turabi knows very well that such an "adventurous" and 
dangerous approach would be just a game that would lead him 
nowhere, for thousands of reasons. Some are legal and 
international and others relate to matters of capability, 
control and work tools [adawat tahakkum wa 'amal], finance, and 
the last one concerns the "defense of life and homeland." I do 
not want to talk about the last one, because I believe it is 
far-fetched. 
  Probably "al-Turabi's major game" is to get rid of south 
Sudan and leave it to become independent and join the black 
African and Christian club south of the Sahara, while keeping 
northern Sudan "ethnically and religiously cleansed." It is the 
same as the Zionist-Jewish theory and the Serbian theory of a 
state racially and religiously purified in full. But there are 
tens of thousands of soldiers from the valiant Sudanese Army who 
fought for many years in defense of a unified Sudan. There are 
also Army officers, his own partners, who waged the "salvation 
revolution" and made him the "spiritual leader" with absolute 
power and authority. These officers, led by Lieutenant General 
al-Bashir, have taken part in the unification war to stop the 
secession and its conspiracies. People who have sacrificed their 
sons to defend the unity and integrity of the soil cannot go 
along with such "racist" notions as those pursued by al-Turabi 
in the name of "Islamic Internationalism," nor with ethnic and 
religious purity. Nobody can betray the blood of martyrs or 
deny the noblest sacrifices. Without that, there is nothing 
left for the shaykh but to provoke Egypt and approach the water 
taboo; and perhaps Egypt will react to his provocation, fall 
into his trap, and decide to put an end to these absurd, 
childish, and suspicious acts. Then mobilization at the border 
would start, Sudan's troops in the south could be pulled back to 
confront "Egypt the aggressor" threatening the Sudanese 
homeland! Then, he could hold Egypt responsible. He could 
distract Egypt and draw its attention away from its major 
development efforts for progress and welfare at home. This 
would hinder Egypt's role in the region and the continent in 
making peace and building bridges of cooperation and growth, and 
would disrupt its international role as a partner in drafting a 
new world order based on democracy, equal rights, and equal 
cooperation. For, chaos is the only atmosphere in which 
al-Turabi and his "groups" could live and expand, even if this 
expansion costs the bodies of people and the debris of destroyed 
and ruined cities. 
  The question is: If these are the intentions and schemes of 
the spiritual leader, what about the views of the lieutenant 
general [al-Bashir] and his team, if they still have any say or 
any decisions to make? But that is another story.

  [Text] Residential areas of Kabul city were the target of 
heavy weapons fired by Golboddin-Dostam militia last night. 
  An official source in the Kabul garrison told a BAKHTAR 
military correspondent that missiles were fired on Kabul city 
from the south and southwest, from areas under the control of 
the shameful militias of Golboddin-Dostam. As a result a number 
of our compatriots were martyred and injured. 
  The report adds that in addition to the loss of life, four 
houses located in the 2d and 11th wards of Kabul city were also 
destroyed in the course of the missile attack.

  [Text] Reports from reliable security sources say that last 
Saturday [4 June], a huge explosion took place in the Huzori 
Bagh, a five-story building in Mazar-e Sharif, in which at the 
present the so-called Central Office of Jenbish [National 
Islamic Movement of North, led by Dostam] is located. 
  As a result of this explosion a number of militiamen were 
killed and the building was damaged. 
  Eye-witnesses say that the number of such explosion has 
recently increased, which indicates chaos in the militias 
security systems.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Saudi Regime's Record Is Replete With </F>
Conspiracy Against Yemen and its Unity"] 
  [Text] Agent Fahd's regime moves anew to strike at Yemen's 
unity, which has been the source of hope for the sons of Yemen 
generation after generation and also the desired objective of 
all the Arab masses that view Yemen's unity as a historic 
pan-Arab step toward a greater unity. As part of its 
conspiratorial and treacherous policy, the Fahd regime has 
adopted a disgraceful position by supporting the agent and 
renegade secessionists and trying to polish their image and 
present them to the international community as a party that is 
equal to the legitimate Yemeni authority. Thus, the Saudi 
regime made feverish moves in the Security Council through 
Fahd's ambassador in Washington Bandar Bin- Sultan, who is known 
for his cheap and exposed contacts with U.S. and Zionist 
intelligence organs before and after the 30-state aggression 
against Iraq. By its recent move in the Security Council, the 
Saudi regime, which has a disgraceful record of conspiracies 
against every Arab unionist project and every national 
authority, is adding a new act of treason to its innumerable 
acts of treason against the Arab nation's higher interests and 
is flagrantly revealing its plot to bring foreign forces to 
Yemen, just as it did in Hafar al-Batin before the aggression 
against Iraq. Saudi Arabia has been the principal enemy of 
every Arab unionist project. The Arabs will never forget how 
the ruling Saudi family plotted against Egyptian-Syrian unity 
and how it paid millions of dollars to mercenaries and traitors 
to undermine that unity and cancel the United Arab Republic. 
  Today, the recent past is repeating itself, and in the same 
way and through more wicked means, the agent regime in Riyadh is 
moving to destroy Yemeni unity, fragment Yemen, create 
differences, and ignite war among the sons of Yemen in order to 
satisfy its U.S., British, and Zionist masters. 
  The Yemeni people suffered greatly from the Saudi rulers' 
plots against the Yemeni revolution in 1962. That family fears 
that the Yemeni revolution may encourage masses in the Arabian 
peninsula to mobilize their energies, wipe out the agent regime, 
and end its hateful role in conspiring against the fateful Arab 
causes, including the Palestine question and a series of 
revolutions and uprisings in many arenas of the Arab East and 
Arab Maghreb. 
  After the revolution succeeded, despite the Saudi 
conspiracy, 
and the Yemeni people were able to preserve the republican 
system by offering many sacrifices in lives and money, the agent 
rulers in Riyadh went crazy and backed every plot to upset 
stability in Yemen and disrupt its people's unity. 
  Fahd, a cheap agent and offspring of a family with a long 
history of treason, will win nothing from his conspiratorial 
step and his treasonous moves except curses and eternal 
disgrace, and the Arab masses will continue to believe that the 
Yemeni unity and every other similar step will remain too strong 
to be harmed by the cowards, who have lost their pan-Arab 
identity and their national zeal and who have turned into mere 
dolls in the hands of the arch enemies of the Arab and Islamic 
nations. 
  Yemeni unity will remain an eternal reality amid the clamor 
caused by agents in the Security Council and their dirty games. 
Yemeni unity was established to last. This is the course of 
history despite agents like Fahd and his page, Bandar.

<F P=106> [Report by Safwat Abu-Talib] </F>
  [Text] Iraqi Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf has 
stated that there are positive signs at the UN Security Council 
that might lead to the lifting of the blockade imposed on Iraq 
in the near future. In a statement to AL-JUMHURIYAH, he 
stressed that his country seeks to extend its hand to the 
neighboring Arab and non-Arab countries to coordinate their 
policies in the interest of the peoples, noting that this desire 
is at times rejected and at other times remains confined to 
contacts, as is the case between Iraq and Qatar and Oman. 
  Responding to a question on the reasons why Iraq refused to 
recognize Security Council Resolution 833 that defines the 
demarcation line and border posts between Iraq and Kuwait, 
al-Sahhaf said that this resolution did not include a provision 
requesting Iraq to recognize it. If it had included such a 
provision, we would not have hesitated to recognize it. He 
added: We agreed to and complied with Security Council 
Resolution 687 that outlined the conditions that must be met to 
lift the blockade. We have met all the conditions, as the ad 
hoc committee and the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] 
have recognized. There is now a majority in the Security 
Council demanding that the embargo be lifted. 
  Al-Sahhaf said: Generally speaking, the Security Council 
requested Iraq to abolish the resolutions regarding Kuwait. We 
indeed abolished all the resolutions, including the one on the 
19th Governorate. This revocation was outlined in official 
letters to the Security Council, which accepted them. 
  Commenting on Iraqi President Saddam Husayn assuming the 
post 
of prime minister in the recently formed cabinet, al-Sahhaf 
said: This decision was made in accordance with a proposal by 
the Revolutionary Command Council to help the Iraqi people deal 
with their suffering. 
  Responding to a question on the possibility of partitioning 
Iraq, al-Sahhaf said: Even if all other countries were to be 
partitioned, Iraq would never be partitioned under any 
circumstances because its social, economic, and cultural fabric 
have survived for more than 7,000 years. The best proof of this 
is the failure of the Kurdish gangs in northern Iraq to achieve 
the schemes drawn for them. 
  Regarding the future of the Nonaligned Movement, al-Sahhaf 
said: We agree with the view President Husni Mubarak proposed at 
his inaugural speech. We believe that there is a need to 
activate the movement and strengthen the bonds among its members 
to face the present and the future, particularly after the 
demise of the Soviet Union. A dialogue should be held between 
the Nonaligned Movement members and the countries of the north 
to prevent accumulation of the causes of conflict. 
  Responding to a question asking if Iraq seeks dialogue and 
respects its neighbors, why it does not respect international 
legitimacy, al-Sahhaf said: International legitimacy has 
substance and is not slogans. The firm substance of the 
international legitimacy is international law and the UN 
charter. Anything else is not international legitimacy. 
  Replying to a question on Iraq's position on the Yemeni war 
and on reports of Iraqi pilots' participation in the war, 
al-Sahhaf emphasized that there is no Iraqi pilot or soldier 
taking part in the Yemeni war. Anyone who says this has to 
prove it. 
  Regarding the Kuwaiti POW's in Iraq, al-Sahhaf said: In 
fact, there is no POW problem but a problem of missing people. 
Kuwait has 611 missing people and Iraq has more than 60,000 
missing. We maintain that this humanitarian issue should be 
addressed in accordance with the Geneva agreements. The files 
we received from Kuwait through the Red Cross Committee affirm 
that they are missing. Every file that the Kuwaiti Government 
submitted has the word missing written on it. This issue will 
take a long time. We must not forget that the Americans still 
have missing personnel in Vietnam.

<F P=106> [Interview with Trade Minister Muhammad Mahdi Salih by Ahmad </F>
'Abd-al-Majid in Baghdad; date not given] 
  [Text] ['Abd-al-Majid] Turkish officials have said Ankara 
is planning to open a trade route via Zakho after the 'Id 
al-Adha holiday. Others said this will happen after a month. 
What is your opinion? 
  [Salih] The Security Council resolutions do not close Iraq's 
borders with neighboring states. The embargo targets our oil 
exports. Iraqi merchants import foodstuffs from Turkey with 
hard currency. As for barter, it is currently not allowed. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] Iraq depends heavily on the Jordanian outlet 
in providing some of its food requirements. What is your 
assessment of the relationship between the two countries? 
  [Salih] The relationship between Jordan and Iraq is firm and 
is advancing steadily in the interest of the two peoples. I 
think there are huge prospects for expanding this relationship 
once the economic blockade is lifted. This is because the links 
and integration are there between the two economies. Lifting 
the blockade will allow for further expansion of ties. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] Jordan has expressed dissatisfaction with 
the inspection of al-'Aqabah-bound commercial vessels and said 
this is doing great economic harm to the country. Does this 
inspection have any negative impact on the Iraq's food imports? 
  [Salih] We have paid extra charges. Also, the high 
insurance rates imposed on some vessels and the smaller load 
they carry are additional obstacles. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] What is the effect of activating Iraqi ports 
in the south on trade activity? 
  [Salih] First of all, there are no restrictions on exports 
to Iraq via the ports of Umm Qasr, Khawr al-Zubayr, and 
al-Basrah. Our ports are open to receive vessels if they wish 
to come. Also, we have other ships laden with food supplies 
from Europe, Australia, and southeast Asia. These use the 
waterway from and to al-Basrah because there are no 
international restrictions on it. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] What about the Iraqi assets frozen in 
foreign banks? 
  [Salih] The United States and its allies are still 
practicing piracy against Iraqi assets and preventing us from 
using these assets to buy food and medical supplies, contrary to 
what the Security Council has allowed under Resolution 687. 
This behavior has denied Iraq a chance to provide some of the 
needs of the population. 
  Iraq had managed, under the instructions of the Security 
Council Embargo Committee, to purchase $250,000 worth of 
supplies before its assets were frozen again in September 1992. 
These food supplies were distributed by the ration card. We 
denounce the decision to prevent us from using our own frozen 
assets abroad and deem it an evil decision that reflects the 
disregard of the nations that control the Security Council for 
the norms and charters and previous resolutions issued by the 
Council. 
  [ 'Abd-al-Majid] There are some Arab states that have not 
released the assets they have. 
  [Salih] There is an Arab siege imposed by the rulers who are 
linked with the U.S. anti-Iraq policy. I am sure that Iraq 
enjoys very wide popular support in the Arab world. We find it 
strange for foreign countries to release our assets when some 
Arab governments impose a siege on us. Switzerland released all 
of our assets in 1991-1992, which amount to almost $125 million; 
Italy also released a limited part of our assets amounting to $6 
million; Austria did the same thing and released around $30 
million; Canada, $3 million; Spain, around $20 million; Greece, 
$13 million. So why don't the Arab countries release our assets 
to enable us to buy food and medicine? 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] What effect will President Saddam Husayn's 
chairmanship of the Cabinet -- after the recent Cabinet 
reshuffle -- have on the activity of the Trade Ministry? 
  [Salih] President Saddam Husayn's contacts with our Ministry 
have never stopped. He has always supervised its activities, 
especially with regard to providing food. He has given this 
question great importance. The state has been used to his 
strong, decisive administration, which was a direct reason for 
the progress and development achieved by the country. His 
excellency's supervision of the Cabinet will energize the 
ministries and give them momentum to expand their activities. 
The Cabinet is in dire need of such administration under the 
circumstances of the blockade, which has lasted for four years. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] The Iraqi family depends on the ration card 
to get its basic needs. Are you planning to increase the items 
listed in this card to alleviate the citizens' suffering under 
the embargo? 
  [Salih] On 1 June this year, President Saddam Husayn decided 
to increase the vegetable oil quota for ration card holders and 
civil servants shopping at the Trade Ministry markets. Every 
family of six members will accordingly get 300-500 dinars in aid. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] Have other states asked to be acquainted 
with 
the ration card system, which was previously considered by 
several organizations an effective system to prevent famine? I 
mean have they tried to benefit from your experience in applying 
this system? 
  [Salih] This system has been assessed on the international 
level. The ration card was considered the best method to 
distribute food in the world. There is no doubt that every 
country has its own experience in encountering states of 
emergency. President Saddam Husayn ordered that this system be 
adopted during the first week of the economic blockade on our 
country. We prepared the card within two weeks and it was 
applied on 1 September 1990, that is, 28 days after the start of 
the embargo. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] What is your assessment of the Iraqi market 
following the recent cabinet reshuffle? 
  [Salih] It led to a noticeable decline in the price of the 
dollar and foodstuffs. There is optimism that the market 
situation will improve. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] Will the prices of foodstuffs drop in the 
future? 
  [Salih] What is important is that we have reaped excellent 
results from leader Saddam Husayn's management of the executive 
authority. This has positively reflected on the market by 
reducing the prices of foodstuffs and the dollar exchange rate. 
Measures have been taken to improve the situation. I think 
that the Revolution Command Council decree to grant the party 
organization and people's assemblies executive jurisdictions to 
monitor the market was a very important new step toward 
expanding the base of popular control of the economic activities 
and promoting local control of market activities. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] How many ships dock at al-Basrah ports with 
food consignments every month? 
  [Salih] We usually announce the arrival of ships. However, I 
think an average of four arrive every month. The importance of 
this maritime activity is that Iraq has been directly linked to 
the world. This has also reduced the cost of transportation, 
especially with regard to our imports from southeast Asia. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] In the light of some signals, can you tell 
us 
when the economic embargo will be lifted? 
  [Salih] As President Saddam Husayn has said, the embargo 
will 
be lifted when the wicked ones feel they are unable to undermine 
the people's steadfastness and their national independent will. 
Through our steadfastness and willpower, we proved that the 
embargo will certainly be lifted and that its continuation is 
not in the interest of the United States or others. Their aims 
will not be achieved under the embargo and great harm has been 
inflicted on their companies and products. During the past four 
years, Iraq could have bought all sorts of commodities and paid 
foreign firms not less than $60 billion. Iraq's annual oil 
revenues of $16 billion used to be spent. This means the world 
economy has lost opportunities to invest $60 billion to expand 
the volume of exports and production and reduce unemployment. 
The big powers also lost the Iraqi market. 
  The world realizes that the tighter the embargo gets, the 
firmer the Iraqis become. As much as $100 billion could have 
gone to foreign firms in the reconstruction drive after the 
military aggression. Iraq has embarked on an effective effort 
to expand its reliance on itself in the fields of agriculture 
and industry in order to achieve self-satisfaction. This 
explains its ability to confront the economic embargo.

  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz has said Iraq's 
relations with fraternal, friendly, and other countries are 
witnessing positive development in terms of backing Iraq's just 
issues. 
  Attending an evening session of the annual diplomatic 
conference of Iraqi ambassadors and heads of diplomatic missions 
abroad, Tariq 'Aziz reviewed Iraq's relations with the world's 
countries, the development of its relationship with the Security 
Council, and the international attitude toward Iraq in general. 
  During the conference, also attended by Foreign Minister 
Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf, the deputy prime minister reviewed 
Iraq's diplomatic and political activity in the international 
arena in light of the growing international support for Iraq, 
even inside the Security Council, to reinforce its just demand 
for lifting the unjust blockade imposed on its people, after it 
has met all its obligations toward the Security Council's 
resolutions. 
  Tariq 'Aziz also explained the means the inspection teams 
had 
adopted to fabricate crises and justifications to continue the 
aggression in all respects.

<F P=106> ["Text" of news conference by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq </F>
'Aziz with "chief editors of local newspapers and magazines, 
heads of information departments, journalists, and writers" on 1 
June; place not given] 
  [Text] Baghdad, INA -- It pleases me to meet with you so 
that we may discuss what took place at the recent UN Security 
Council session and the conclusions we reached after this 
session. I am certain you read the statement issued by the 
spokesman for the joint meeting of the Revolution Command 
Council and the Ba'th Partry command. This statement contains 
basic signs about the recent UN Security Council session and 
basic signs about our conclusions from this session. However, I 
found it useful to provide the Iraqi press with more details 
about this session. 
  A substantial change took place in the UN Security Council's 
stand last March. As you know, in its periodic review of the 
situation before March the UN Security Council used to issue a 
short statement called (Iyala Lasso), a reference to the former 
Ecuadoran ambassador at the UN Security Council who had drawn up 
this formula at the time to show that the council members are 
still not convinced that the conditions for lifting the embargo 
from Iraq have been met. Such a statement was issued for the 
last time in February 1994. In March, as you know, three 
important UN Security Council permanent members, France, Russia, 
and the PRC, called for changing this formula. 
  These countries said there is clear progress with respect to 
the implementation of the UN Security Council Resolutions and 
that such progress should be reflected in the statemnent. The 
United States and the United Kingdom and some countries which 
indulge them objected to this proposal. A serious discussion 
was held within the council at the end of which the council did 
not reach any decision. This was verily viewed as a crucial 
change in the UN Security Council stand. It is the first time 
that the council finds itself divided on the stand on Iraq, a 
division among the five UN Security Council permanent members. 
There was a majority within this group: three countries calling 
for a change. There was also division among the nonpermanent 
members. Some of these members supported the three permanent 
members calling for a change. Other members did not support 
that or remained silent. 
  Before we left for New York to attend the May session, we 
did 
not expect this session would bring about a substantial change 
in stands because the Special Commission's work of putting in 
place the long-term monitoring system has not been completed. 
There was talk last March and even now that this will be 
completed in July, meaning that the Special Commission and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] were expected to 
submit a report on the completion of this system to the council 
in July. 
  From this premise, neither I nor the comrades in the command 
expected that the May review would bring about substantial 
changes. However, we had to go to New York and we had to hold 
extensive contacts before the session with UN Security Council 
members and other important countries which influence 
international public opinion, which in its turn influences the 
stand within the UN Security Council. 
  At the instructions of the president leader, ranking envoys 
visited several countries. As you know, the minister of culture 
and information visited several Arab countries. The foreign 
minister visited three countries in Asia: India, Malaysia, and 
Indonesia, the chairman of the Nonaligned Movement. Barzan 
al-Tikriti, the president's political adviser, visited Arab 
countries in North Africa. 
  On the other hand, envoys at the level of ambassadors and 
advisers to the foreign minister visited other capitals of the 
UN member states, as well as other states not members of the 
Security Council. Foreign Ministry Under Secretary Dr. [Riyad] 
al-Qaysi visited Pakistan and China. Visits were also made to 
countries in Europe, such as Greece, Germany, Austria and 
others, as well as the Vatican. Other visits were made to 
Africa and Latin America. During these visits, the situation 
and the facts were explained to these states. They were told 
that fairness, justice, logic, and the correct legal reading of 
the UN Security Council resolutions must lead to the 
implementation of Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 and that the 
obstacle in this regard is the U.S. attitude. This fact was 
clear on the international level. 
  While we were in New York, we were required to continue to 
explain things and abort the counterattack that started after 
March when the United States and its lackeys in the region found 
out that Iraqi political and diplomatic activity had begun to 
produce results by changing the attitude inside the UN Security 
Council. They started a large-scale diplomatic and 
non-diplomatic campaign for which they mobilized several 
means--money and bribes paid by the Saudi and Kuwaiti rulers and 
pressure and influence by the United States. The Americans had 
to appear in public, in this instance. As you know, Christopher 
met with the ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council and 
warned them against rapprochement with Iraq, because there was 
some rapprochement. This still exists on the part of certain 
states. He warned them against such a rapprochement and then 
did an unprecedented thing. He wrote an article in THE NEW YORK 
TIMES in which he said the embargo against Iraq should not be 
lifted, that the embargo should continue, and so forth. 
Incidentally, I will tell you this, as journalists. I replied 
to that article in an article which I published and then sent 
with a letter to an editor at THE NEW YORK TIMES. We had to be 
there to answer questions and strengthen the convictions of the 
various states in a positive direction. 
  We met with all members of the UN Security Council, except 
the United States. I met with the four permanent members -- the 
British, the French, the Russian, and the Chinese. I met with 
some of them more than once. Some of the meetings were held 
jointly. I also met with the other members of the council and 
with ambassadors of other states that were not members of the 
Security Council. We had a lengthy discussion about the entire 
situation. They told us about their expectations of the 
session. They said: The United States refuses to acknowledge 
progress in implementing the Security Council resolution and is 
insisting on that position, and Britain will go along with this 
position. Therefore, most likely, the council will not make any 
decision, meaning there will be no new statement. The trend is 
to not issue any statement, as was the case in March. Indeed 
the council met on 17 May. 
  Here, I would like to reiterate the following facts: 
  First: the states that took a positive position in March 
have maintained, and even improved, their position. I read some 
remarks from press sources, which I respect, but I do not think 
they are aware of the facts. These remarks were made here and 
there, and suggested some retreat in the position of certain 
states. There is no retreat in the positions of Russia, France, 
and China. Their position is firm, and it is even clearer than 
it was in March, because relations between the competent Iraqi 
authorities on the one hand and the Special Commission and the 
IAEA on the other are proceeding very well, in a professional 
manner. There are no problems. This fact is known to all these 
states. On my way to New York, I visited Vienna and met with 
the IAEA director general, who confirmed these facts in a 
statement issued after the meeting. The reasons that caused 
these states to change their position in March are still valid 
in May. They were even strengthened by the continued technical 
implementation of the Security Council resolutions, particularly 
Section C of Resolution 687. 
  In March, some states showed positive signs appeasing or 
supporting the position of the three states that called for a 
change in the May meeting. The position of these states was 
clear. Examples of these states are Spain, Brazil, Pakistan, and 
Nigeria. As the Russian ambassador, who took the initiative in 
this meeting, told me, we can now argue with the U.S. side and 
demand that the statement be changed. He also told me that I 
was not alone in this meeting when I demanded a change; eight 
members spoke with me. In the March meeting, two other council 
members, namely, New Zealand and the Czech Republic, showed a 
negative attitude and did not talk in favor of a change. 
  In this meeting, however, the New Zealand and Czech members 
remained silent and made no statements. During our meetings 
with the representatives of these two countries, they showed a 
good level of understanding and acknowledged progress had been 
made. They, however, did not commit themselves to announcing 
this in the council's meetings for political considerations. 
  There is now a tangible majority of member states in the 
council that call for changing the statement's formula. These 
states also acknowledge that progress was achieved in 
implementing the Security Council resolutions. They believe the 
economic blockade imposed on Iraq should be addressed by the 
council, that the blockade should not be eternal and should not 
last long. They also believe the Iraqi people's suffering 
deserves attention and that the council should prove its 
credibility by fulfilling its commitments toward Iraq in 
exchange for Iraq's fulfillment of its commitments in accordance 
with the council's resolutions. These states called for this 
during the council's deliberations. They also call for this in 
our bilateral contacts with them. 
  For your information, only the U.S. representative made a 
very bad statement filled with falsehoods and contradictions. 
Both the language she used and the presentation she made in the 
council's meeting were not shown in the remarks made by other 
representatives. Even the British representative, who joined the 
U.S. political position on not changing the statement's formula, 
spoke in a language somewhat different from the U.S. language 
and could not deny progress had been achieved. 
  Only one country, namely, Argentina, cheaply--and I must 
briefly describe its position as a cheap one--supported the U.S. 
position in a way that did not show a respected diplomatic 
level. This is the position of these three states. Two other 
countries remained silent, and the majority of the remaining 10 
countries showed a positive attitude. Thus, I consider that 
what happened in May was progress in the situation. 
  Naturally, I cannot describe this meeting as a victory or 
say 
that it realized great achievements. This is because the 
achievement which we, along with our people, are expecting is to 
take tangible steps on the path to the lifting of the blockade. 
However, this political and diplomatic process is very 
complicated, and it is influenced by many circumstances and 
positions and needs time and efforts. Hence, what happened in 
May is considered progress on the path to lifting or easing the 
blockade. 
  The level of both listening to, and understanding of, the 
Iraqi viewpoint on all issues, whether regarding the weapons, 
the implementation of Section C of Resolution 687, or other 
issues evoked against Iraq, is much higher and deeper than ever 
before. 
  As you know, I visited New York twice in 1992. I travelled 
there again in March, 1993 to address the UN Security Council. 
Fifteen council members spokes ahead of me, the representative 
of Iraq. Maybe I had something new to say. I made this 
observation to the council president. I told him that ordinarily 
the guest should speak first, but I have been accorded a 
treatment incompatible with the traditions of hospitality and 
the meetings and the statement that was printed and circulated 
among the 15 member states. 
  Before the council began, we used to meet with council 
members, some of whom were not hostile or tendentious. I mean, 
they listened and showed some measure of sympathy, but did not 
follow the drift of the argument quite seriously. We must 
credit the change that took place in 1992 to Iraq's 
steadfastness. 
  In 1991 and 1992, thanks to the U.S. and Western media, and 
other media paid by the rulers of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, many 
people and nations were not hostile to Iraq. They were friends 
with vested interests in Iraq. [two preceding sentences as 
published] They thought that Iraq would not hold out. How can a 
small nation like Iraq hold out after an unparalleled ferocious 
aggression? How can it hold out after such a comprehensive 
siege and a political and media offensive? They thought it was 
just a matter of time. 
  Even when you speak logically and on a legal basis and 
advance convincing and clear arguments under normal 
circumstances, the representatives of state X or state Y shakes 
his head and says: We love the Iraqi people and sympathize with 
them, but what can we do? This man speaks now. Maybe in a year 
we will not see him. He will not be committed or responsive. 
Not that he is a man of bad faith. But he acts realistically as 
one would expect in our world. As you know, stands based on 
principle and moral values are not there anymore. Now there is 
realpolitik. Things are different now. Now we seek interviews 
with UN Security Council members -- even representatives of 
member nations that participated in the aggression on Iraq. I 
ask to meet them in my residence at the Iraqi ambassador's 
house. We sit for an hour, or an hour and a half, and talk. We 
disagree, but they listen earnestly to what I say. 
  As for the nations that have no tendentious stands toward 
Iraq and those that had interests with Iraq in the past and were 
friends with Iraq, these began to listen attentively and 
empathize with our grievances and the arbitrary fashion in which 
Iraq is treated, and the unprecedented texts, which are not 
necessary even from the UN Security Council's perspective. 
These nations now listen and understand. 
  Then there is the reception our envoys had when they visited 
foreign countries. We recently made visits that until recently 
were out of the question. I visited Austria and met with its 
foreign minister, and on my way back I visited Spain and met 
with Spanish officials. 
  These are signs that Iraq's position is being understood 
much 
more than in the past. One thing that we must also particularly 
note as media people is the visits made to Iraq by major 
entrepreneurs who are heavyweights in their countries. Some, or 
most, of these nations are members of the UN Security Council 
and they can decide to lift or retain the embargo or prolong or 
curtail it. 
  Their visits to Iraq, their meetings with Iraqi officials, 
and their search for job opportunities indicate that they 
completely acknowledge Iraq's steadfastness. It is obvious that 
they admit Iraq has stood fast in the face of the blockade, the 
political and media campaign, and all the conspiracies that have 
been concocted against it. 
  At the same time, it is an acknowledgement that the blockade 
will be lifted and that after it is lifted, these states and 
companies will try to benefit from dealing with Iraq, which 
enjoys a huge potential in terms of economic cooperation. 
  All these are positive signs, but just as excessive 
pessimism 
is completely wrong, excessive optimism also lacks balance. As 
the leader president stressed on many occasions, we have to 
stand fast on all levels. This is our firm Iraqi national 
option. We have to stand fast, to continue our work on the 
domestic level, and to invest all our revenues, energies, and 
creativity to run our affairs in order to confront the impact of 
the blockade. The world's awareness and acknowledgement of our 
success in this area will help shorten the remaining time of the 
blockade. It is, however, clear to me and to any objective 
observer that this subject is and will be under discussion. As 
an official who holds direct contacts with states, I do not 
advise setting dates, or to say: Since the blockade was not 
lifted in May, it will not be lifted in July. This is wrong 
both politically and diplomatically. There is a meeting in July 
which is very important and possibly decisive, although 
deliberations, discussions, and proposals inside the Security 
Council may take a month. This is possible. 
  This is a U.S. political process, and Saudi Arabia employs 
pressure and bribes one state or another to delay the issue for 
two or three weeks. 
  Ekeus may raise a new issue for the first time. We have to 
prepare ourselves for all possibilities. This does not mean 
that moves toward lifting the blockade have stopped or will 
stop. On the contrary, they are still going on firmly and will 
achieve results, God willing. 
  I do not want to set a date, as this is wrong. The president 
said during a cabinet meeting yesterday that the remaining time 
is shorter than the time that has elapsed. I can add a word and 
say that the remaining time is much shorter, not only in days or 
even in months, than the time that has elapsed. 
  Acknowledgment that Iraq has stood fast is obvious. Those 
who deny this deny reality. They know the reality, but they do 
not want to admit it because they do not want to reveal their 
failure. The United States does not want to officially announce 
the failure of its program against Iraq. The same applies to 
some U.S. satellites, including some Arabs and some other 
unrespectable and imbalanced states. 
  The majority of states, including the Security Council 
member 
states and European, Asian, and other states, know and admit 
that Iraq has stood fast and that the steadfastness of a country 
like Iraq with human, leadership, scientific, and cultural 
qualifications and with a huge economic potential means that it 
has a bright future. Therefore, these states should deal with 
strong and prosperous Iraq that enjoys this huge potential. 
  A question from [AL-THAWRAH Chief Editor] Taha al-Basri: 
There are two questions directly related to this subject, 
concerning the impression that there is a little deviation in 
the positions of the three states which the deputy prime 
minister mentioned, namely, Russia, France, and China. These 
questions may be triggered by what Western media are 
circulating, to the effect that these states are linking the 
question of reconsidering the embargo to resolutions that are 
not directly related to Resolution 687, particularly Resolutions 
833 and 688. In press interviews, the envoys of Russia and 
France suggested that Iraq has to abide by these two 
resolutions, thus giving the impression they leaned somewhat 
toward the U.S. position, which did not discuss Resolution 687 
from a technical viewpoint, but linked that resolution to other 
resolutions that are not directly related to it. These two 
resolutions concern the measures taken by the UN Security 
Council and the sanctions imposed on Iraq. We want you to 
explain the motives behind the statements, which spoke clearly 
about or hinted at Iraq's dealing with these two resolutions, 
particularly those made by the Russian and French envoys in 
press interviews. This is one question. 
  The second question is: Certain permanent members, 
particularly France, asked Ekeus, the Special Commission 
chairman, to submit a monthly report on the extent of progress, 
or the problems between Iraq and the UN specialized committees. 
Has anything happened in this regard? Should we expect any 
positive steps as a result of that request? The request gives 
the impression that France does not want the United States to be 
the only party that is well informed about what is going on, and 
that other permanent members must also know everything. Has 
anything happened in this regard? What are the positive aspects 
of the French request? 
  Mr. Tariq 'Aziz said: Regarding the first question, I said 
at the beginning of this meeting that there is an impression or 
a view that there is some change or retreat, or as Mr. al-Basri 
has described it, a deviation in the position of the three 
states, France, Russia, and China. I underlined that there is 
no change in their positions. 
  From a legal viewpoint, Russia, France, and China do not 
link 
Resolution 687 to the other resolutions. They do not link, from 
a legal viewpoint, the implementation of Paragraph 22 to the 
other resolutions that are not related to what we call section C 
of Resolution 687. However, they say that dealing with, or 
addressing the other resolutions will facilitate the 
implementation of Paragraph 22 and will ease or remove the 
pretexts which the other party -- the Americans -- and those who 
go along with them use to obstruct the removal of the sanctions. 
This is their argument. There is nothing new in this. I heard 
the same thing from them in November 1993, and when I met with 
them in March. I heard it for the third time during my [recent] 
meetings with them. To state this or not state it does not mean 
there is a change in their position. There are other UN 
Security Council resolutions that concern other issues. These 
states have an interest in these resolutions for political 
reasons and because they have interests with Saudi Arabia, with 
Kuwait, and in the region, and not only with Iraq. They also 
have an interest because these resolutions were issued by the 
Security Council, of which they are permanent members. 
  I expect them to show interest in these resolutions and to 
ask Iraq to deal with them. This is not surprising for us. 
But, in addition to this, they call in the UN Security Council 
to recognize that there is positive progress and for looking 
into the question of lifting the embargo as soon as possible. 
The French, the Russian, and the Chinese envoys specifically 
implied in March and this month that the question of lifting the 
embargo should be expeditiously discussed. The French 
representative said in his speech that the time will come very 
soon to discuss this issue. 
  With respect to the monthly report, it has become a monthly 
event. After the French President of the UN Security Council 
asked Ekeus to submit a monthly report as of March, Ekeus 
submitted one on 28 April and it was a positive report. Today, 
he will submit his second report to the council. Over the past 
few days, I believe Saturday or Sunday, the foreign minister on 
his way to Cairo through Amman, accompanied by 'Amir Rashid, 
director of the Military Industrialization Organization, met 
with Ekeus in Amman to discuss an issue that needs to be 
followed up. As Lieutenant General 'Amir Rashid told me, Ekeus 
promised to submit a factual report. This means the report will 
be a positive one because the facts are positive. 
  Al-QADISIYAH Chief Editor Hani Wuhayyib asked the following 
question: Some press sources say a retraction took place in the 
May session, compared with what was achieved in the March 
session, and that the man on the street falsely believes that so 
long as the U.S. stand is against the lifting of the embargo -- 
the man on the street also believes that the United States is 
the country holding sway over the council and the one that 
decides what resolutions are issued -- this weakens the chances 
of lifting the embargo. The man on the street also believes 
that even if there is a majority within the council for lifting 
the embargo, the United States will veto any resolution calling 
for lifting the embargo, and that all this results in 
frustration for the man on street. 
  Tariq 'Aziz said: I wanted to speak about this topic before, 
because I hear such talk, even from my own family. They ask me: 
How can the embargo be lifted if the United States does not want 
it? In 1990 and 1991, the United States succeeded in passing 
resolutions against Iraq through the consent of the member 
countries in the council, or through pressure. This was why the 
resolutions were passed with an overwhelming majority. 
  Some resolutions were even unanimously passed. Countries 
which had the right of veto and did not support these 
resolutions did not use the veto. They abstained. This 
actually happened. That's why there were so many resolutions. 
Why do these countries which participated in these resolutions, 
including three permanent member countries, meet with the Iraqi 
deputy prime minister during his visits to Washington? They 
talk with him and discuss the details of the implementation of 
the resolutions, and during the council sessions they call for 
lifting the embargo. They know the United States will not 
agree. Why then? Their interests will not be served if the 
embargo is not lifted. One might say they are placating Iraqi 
to obtain their interests. How can they get their interests if 
the embargo is not lifted? How can France, Russia, the PRC, 
Spain, Brazil, the permanent and nonpermanent members, resume 
their trade exchange with Iraq if the embargo is not lifted? 
The countries which deep down know that the embargo will not be 
lifted will not deal with us. Why bother? Had I been an 
ambassador of a country with interests in the world and the 
Iraqi deputy prime minister comes and asks me to speak, why 
should I bother with him, knowing that his cause is a lost 
cause, because the United States will not agree? 
  What he obtains from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the U.S. 
allies and followers in the region is better than wasting his 
time with me. In other words, it is a futile matter. 
  It is true that the United States still has influence in the 
world. However, the U.S. influence is no longer the same as 
that in 1990, '91, and '92. This is because changes have 
occurred in Russia, China, France, and the world as a whole. 
You now see the results of elections in Hungary, where the 
former Communist Party was toppled. However, this party 
reorganized itself as a socialist party under a liberal system 
whose rulers fully supported the United States. In 1992, 
Hungary's representative in the Security Council was more cruel 
toward us than the U.S. representative. Under a liberal system 
and after elections, which were fully democratic by Western 
standards, this party won 56 percent of votes and an 
overwhelming parliamentary majority. This also happened in 
Poland, in addition to the results of elections in Russia. 
  The world is changing, but not in the direction specified by 
George Bush, which was called the new world order. The George 
Bush order is finished; it fell down and failed. There is now a 
different international situation with a measure of balance. I 
cannot say this situation has the same full balance as that 
which existed before Gorbachev assumed power, prior to the 
Soviet Union's downfall. However, the world is developing a new 
shape by creating new balances. Thus, you find that the Iraqi 
position enjoys being listened to. They are listening to us 
now, which was not the case in 1992. Even those who used to 
lend us a deaf ear, as the popular saying goes, are now 
listening to us, receiving us in their capitals, and sending 
firms to discuss contracts and projects. Hence, they know that 
the blockade will be lifted and that the United States will not 
willingly obstruct [lifting the blockade]. The United States is 
now obstructing, and it used to obstruct this. Had it not been 
for the U.S. position, it would have been possible to seriously 
discuss implementing Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 in December 
1992, after an official document on dealing with Resolution 715 
was submitted. The United States, however, obstructed this. 
  Ekeus will submit a report after which there will be a study 
of the so-called test period. These are the results of the U.S. 
obstruction. The United States can obstruct and perpetuate 
things. It, however, cannot ultimately stop them. A preliminary 
discussion has thus far been held in the circles and the 
corridors of the Security Council. I asked ambassadors from 
important states whether the United States would resort to the 
veto. They said: We rule out a veto. Based on my simple 
knowledge in this regard, my analysis was that the United States 
will not use the veto because the Security Council resolutions 
against Iraq were based on the so-called international consensus 
(consensus at the Security Council). But when most Security 
Council member states and most permanent member states see that 
the reasons for imposing the blockade and embargo are removed 
and that only the United States has used the veto, then the 
legal and logical basis for these resolutions will fall. 
Consequently, these states can say that they would not comply 
with these resolutions if the United States wants to control the 
Security Council through its isolated decision. 
  Iraq, they will think, then, has legitimate interests. 
These nations will argue that the reasons that were behind the 
way they handled Iraq did not obtain. So let's act 
independently, their argument goes. These nations have 
political, military, and economic clout. The majority of the 
international community will then follow suit and the U.S. 
position will become isolated, just as it is on Cuba. The 
United States is boycotting Cuba, but the United Kingdom is not, 
and the same holds for Brazil and France, each weighing its own 
interests. The Americans are bound to make their position clear 
soon. 
  Now I explained to you that in the most recent session, it 
emerged that as regards Iraq, the United States is in a minority 
in the Security Council. This is important. I even told an 
ambassador that this lady -- the U.S. UN delegate -- or any 
other delegate, for that matter, is supposed to portray a true 
picture when they find themselves beleaguered and in the 
minority camp. She should tell her leaders that, on that issue, 
we are now a minority. I told him: Do you think she will say 
this to her president. He said: Yes, I think she will. 
Furthermore, it is now reported and shown on television 
screens. You, as media people, watch foreign television 
stations that are monitoring the situation. It is now obvious 
that the U.S. position belongs in the minority. 
  Dr. Sabah Yasin put the following question: You mentioned 
progress on the political front. However, the news media have 
now embarked on a new drive to disrupt or delay the mechanism of 
the Special Commission and involve it in the implementation of 
Resolution 715, implying that the mechanism of the commission is 
also tied to a U.S. political decision. How accurate is this 
assessment? How are you dealing with the Special Commission and 
IAEA to speed the completion of its final report that will 
contribute to the work of Paragraph 22, Section C. 
  Mr. Tariq 'Aziz: Answering the previous question, I said 
that if it were not for the U.S. position, the Special 
Commission and the IAEA would have gone to the Security Council 
in January and told them that the road is now open for a debate 
on Paragraph 22, and that, for our part, we are ready. This 
much I told Ekeus in the presence of his aides and members of 
the Iraqi delegation. I told him: You can now go to the 
Security Council and tell them I am satisfied, because you know 
and I know that you obtained all that Section C of Resolution 
687 requires. By such delays, you are saving the U.S. 
Administration. 
  I told him: You are presenting ambiguous points, gray, as 
they say. You are helping the U.S. position. He could not 
prove the contrary and defended himself, but could not prove me 
wrong. This game, however, has an end. This is because this 
game is played according to pretexts of a technical nature. 
When these pretexts become clear, people will say Iraq has a 
good point. Another important thing is what has happened, from 
January until now, including the monthly report. Other nations 
that previously did not care about the Special Commission's 
reports and took them at their face value now take an interest 
in the details of the Special Commission's work. 
  Whenever there is an report by the Special Commission or 
any statement by Ekeus that tells them that Iraq did not agree 
to so and so, and this is considered a violation of the 
cease-fire resolutions, the UN Security Council would 
immediately issue a statement saying Iraq has violated the 
cease-fire resolution. You recall the last statement that was 
issued in this month in 1993 by the Security Council regarding 
the monitoring cameras. Now the states that are interested in 
lifting the embargo imposed on Iraq are interested in the work 
of the commission. Consequently, the staff of the Special 
Commission, including its chairman, are now aware that all eyes 
are watching so they cannot fabricate many pretexts. There will 
probably be a pretext here or a pretext there, but there are 
qualified Iraqis to tackle and explain this. There are 
delegations -- the delegations which we visited, as well as the 
delegations that made visits to various capitals. We were 
sending specialists to explain to the states that are interested 
in the work of the Special Commission the minute details 
concerning what Iraq has done and the pretexts which the Special 
Commission may fabricate to prolong the process. These 
high-level experts explained things to the French, the Russians, 
the Chinese, and others. This process continued whenever we 
felt there was a need to make a technical explanation. We are 
doing that now. This time when we went to New York, no one 
raised this question, except the United States. The U.S. lies 
were disdained because this was a U.S. political position and 
U.S. propaganda. Even the British, who support the U.S. 
political position, did not raise any technical pretexts 
regarding the work of the Special Committee. The British envoy 
said the committee's reports indicate progress and that work is 
proceeding well. 
  The same goes for the IAEA. Its reports fall in that 
direction. Therefore, according to expectations, the Special 
Commission and the IAEA will undoubtedly soon go to the council 
to announce what has been achieved, and July is approaching as I 
have said. Let us consider the worst possibilities: You must 
both go to the Security Council and say this is what has been 
achieved. We completed the implementation of Section C of 
Resolution 687. Now how would the council deal with the subject? 
  Amir al-Hulw [ALIF BA' chief editor] said: There is a 
question which the ordinary man in the street in Iraq is asking 
-- and the same question was asked by the chairman of the U.S. 
Congress Foreign Relations Committee: What does the United 
States want from Iraq? The United States is now raising certain 
political issues and says that Iraq has not arrived at this 
level of response, without that level of pressure, so let us 
continue in the same way to realize certain political 
objectives, some of which you have addressed? 
  Tariq 'Aziz: Funnily enough, the chairman of the U.S. 
Congress Foreign Relations Committee asked this question to 
Assistant Secretary of State Pelletreau in a hearing and 
demanded an answer. Pelletreau promised to send a written, 
confidential answer. We heard from our sources there that the 
answer did not satisfy the Foreign Relations Committee chairman, 
not because of the answer itself, but because the answer was 
not clear. There are two sides to the U.S. position. There is 
the well-known public position. The United States has taken a 
hostile attitude toward Iraq and set certain objectives for 
Iraq. It targets it as a country, a people, and a national 
leadership, but none of these objectives has been realized. 
Yesterday, I was at a meeting with two U.S. journalists who are 
following the issue. I told them that when I met with Baker in 
Geneva he threatened me. He said we will hit you and return 
Iraq to the pre-industrial age and that another leadership will 
decide the future of Iraq. 
  I said to him: Your Excellency the minister, your country 
is very strong, and you have huge potentials and deadly weapons. 
Yes, you will cause severe damage to us, and it is clear from 
your talk that you will attack us. But Iraq is 6,000 years old, 
has experienced many difficulties, suffered much from invasions, 
and remained capable of offering sacrifices and achieving 
progress and prosperity. Therefore, your first aim of returning 
us to the pre-industrial age will not be achieved. The second 
aim, the replacement of the leadership, will also not take 
place, because the Iraqi people, the Arab nation, and the 
region's peoples hate the United States for its hostility to the 
Arab nation, its bias toward the enemies of the Arab nation, and 
its encroachment on and its exploitation of our country and our 
nation. Therefore, every one fighting the United States will be 
backed by the people. I then gave him the following example: 
You know that when Egypt lost the war with Israel in 1967, 
Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir resigned but the Egyptian masses returned 
him to center of leadership despite the clear, unjustified 
military defeat at that time. The people refused to submit to 
the logic of the Israeli enemy, which was supported by the 
United States in the 1967 aggression. 
  I said to them: Now we are in 1994. Are we really in the 
pre-industrial age? They said: No. We visited Baghdad and 
other capitals in the region. The situation in Baghdad is 
better than that of other capitals. Electric power exists 
around the clock, while it is cut off in Damascus for 12 to 14 
hours a day and while Egypt is suffering from problems in the 
services area, although these countries are not besieged. They 
also continue their trade operations. Yet, services are better 
in Baghdad. This is what they, and not Tariq 'Aziz, say. 
  So, the first aim, returning Iraq to the pre-industrial age, 
has failed, and the second aim has also failed. It is clear 
that Iraq and its leadership are still steadfast and that the 
people are rallying around their leadership because this is the 
policy the Iraqis have chosen, at least in the modern age since 
the 1920 revolution -- a national policy of dignity, strength, 
and independence. 
  The current U.S. Administration does not want to admit its 
failure, but it will admit it in the final analysis. This is 
luckily how the Americans act. They are pragmatists. The 
pragmatist refuses to admit failure for some time, but admits it 
later. 
  It is known that confusion exists in U.S. foreign policy. It 
is their circles, press, and Congress which say this, and not 
me. There is confusion in U.S. foreign policy. Therefore, 
running U.S. foreign policy is neither organized nor clear even 
to the Americans themselves. 
  They take this or that position because the matter is not 
clear to them. This kind of confusion affects U.S. positions 
toward many issues, including Iraq. As I have previously said, 
the United States has begun to discover that its isolation in 
the Security Council has become complete. A prominent 
ambassador told me that when the proposal to lift the blockade 
on Iraq is put on the table, the United States should choose, 
and will choose. Some Western circles expected the United 
States not to oppose the unanimous or the majority decision in 
the council. 
  Journalist Ahmad 'Abd-al-Majid asked the following question: 
  There is a view being circulated in our quarters that the 
Iraqi diplomacy has concentrated its efforts over the past 
period on the members of the Security Council and that it has 
somewhat delayed its moves outside this framework. In your 
assessment, what would we have gained if we had concentrated our 
efforts toward these countries instead of the members of the 
Security Council? Could we have achieved the same results we 
have achieved during this period or could we have seen progress 
in the stands or level of understanding of these countries? 
  Tariq 'Aziz: I admit that in the first phase of our 
diplomatic move, in 1991 and 1992, we focused on the Security 
Council member states. This was not a wrong option because 
ultimately the Security Council is the one which will make the 
decision. Any African country will become more important when 
it becomes a member of the Security Council. When this country 
is not a member of the Security Council it will continue to be 
important, but will not have a vote at the Security Council. 
When it takes part in the voting at the Security Council such a 
country will become more important. Therefore, diplomatic moves 
focused on the member states of the Security Council. This is 
correct. However, should we be satisfied with this? This is 
the question. Should we be satisfied with the moves toward the 
members of the Security Council? My answer is: No. For this 
reason, I told you that recently we expanded our contacts to 
cover states that are not members of the Security Council but 
which are also influential. 
  India and Malaysia were members of the Security Council, but 
now, they are not. Indonesia would become a Security Council 
member next year. So we moved toward it and the foreign 
minister paid a visit to Indonesia which declared positive 
stands on lifting the siege of Iraq. 
  As for Europe, we are contacting European countries. I 
visited two European countries: One during my departure trip 
[to New York] and the other during my return trip. Foreign 
Ministry official Wisam al-Zahawi and Dr. 'Abd-al-Amir al-Anbari 
toured Europe. They visited all of Eastern Europe. The Czech 
Republic is the only East European country which is now a member 
of the Security Council. The Iraqi representative [at the 
United Nations] visited Poland, Romania, and Hungary, in 
addition to the Czech Republic. Wisam al-Zahawi visited Greece, 
the Vatican, Germany, Austria, while Dr. al-Anbari visited 
Portugal, in addition to Spain, which is a member of the 
Security Council. 
  We are contacting these countries now. It would have been 
useful had we visited these countries in 1991 and 1992. 
However, we should pay attention to a very important thing 
which I mentioned at the beginning of the meeting. Had we sent 
10 delegations to visit all the world in 1991 and 1992 they 
would certainly would received governments' and popular 
organizations' sympathy with Iraq, its leadership, and Iraq's 
leader. But, practically these countries would have done 
nothing for us. Now that Iraq has remained steadfast, and the 
world has become aware of this a change has been noticed in the 
Security Council. This is significant. Those in Asia and 
Europe would say since there is a change in the Security Council 
there should be something new. Therefore, when an Iraqi envoy 
visits them they will show concern, listen to him, discuss 
things with him, and speak about their future interests with 
him. Thus, the visit would achieve its results. If there was 
any shortcoming in the past, this has been tackled and the 
results, which are being achieved from the contacts with these 
countries, will be useful. 
  Salah al-Mukhtar, chief editor of AL-JUMHURIYAH, asked the 
following question: If the United States insists on maintaining 
the blockade and tries to oppose the will of the majority, then 
the other nations will have to weasel out of their commitment 
regarding the blockade. Can we assume -- and this question has 
been discussed by the Turkish media -- that Turkey, on account 
of its economic crisis, will perhaps be the first nation to 
weasel out of its official commitment with regard to the 
blockade if the United States continues it in an arbitrary way? 
Another question. If we assume that the Security Council wants 
to lift the blockade soon, does this require a statement or a 
new resolution? There are two conflicting views on this issue. 
Some people say that the Council needs a new resolution to lift 
the blockade, and since there has not been a unanimous position 
on this, then the lifting of the blockade is delayed. Another 
view maintains that a statement by the Council will do. Which 
view is correct, a statement or a resolution as a prelude to 
lifting the blockade? I also have a query about a report 
published by the local press. The report says that a former 
member of the U.S. Congress, who visited Iraq last month, said 
that a conference for businessmen will be held in Washington in 
May to discuss lifting the blockade and its effects on U.S. 
firms and interests. He said the Iraqi trade and oil ministers 
are invited. Is this true? 
  Tariq 'Aziz: Regarding the second issue, whether a statement 
or a resolution is needed, it is my personal view that 
implementing Paragraph 22 requires a resolution because it is 
part of a resolution and therefore its implementation requires a 
resolution. Technically speaking, issuing a statement by the 
Security Council is more difficult than issuing a resolution, 
despite the fact that a statement does not have the power of a 
resolution. According to the Security Council tradition, a 
statement should get the approval of the five permanent Security 
Council member states who have the veto right. If any of them 
insists on opposing the statement, then the president of the 
Security Council will be embarrassed to issue the statement and 
the statement he makes will not have the strength of a Security 
Council statement. A resolution, however, can be issued by a 
majority of nine members, provided it is not opposed or vetoed 
by a permanent member. So technically speaking, issuing a 
resolution is easier than issuing a statement. 
  As for Turkey and the others, the Turks have been saying 
that 
the blockade has greatly harmed Turkey on the financial, 
economic, security, and social levels. These statements are 
issued by senior Turkish officials. When the Turkish Foreign 
Ministry under secretary visited Baghdad, and before that in our 
contacts with the Turkish side, we told them: Why don't you 
cite Article 50 of the UN Charter, which says something like: 
When the Security Council adopts a resolution imposing an 
embargo against a certain country, then the country that is 
harmed by this embargo may go to the Council and ask for its 
problem to be solved. The Council could compensate it, one way 
or another, and it can discuss the way to remedy this situation 
with the Council. Of course, the Council does not have enough 
money to give compensations. The party that used to pay the 
compensations is known to the countries that took part in the 
aggression and the blockade against Iraq. However, this well is 
running dry because the United States is using too much of it 
and the well is not the way it was before. Money is no longer 
being paid. The Security Council does not have enough money to 
give to anybody. Turkey can go to the Security Council and say: 
Based on Article 50 we want to deal with Iraq and the Iraqis do 
not mind in principle. But they would not allow Turkey to do 
this. There is great pressure on Turkey and it is not allowed 
to go to the Council at present. 
  I personally have no information about the third news 
report. 
This might have happened. If such a meeting takes place and if 
Iraqi officials are invited to it, I would recommend 
participating in it although the U.S. side is tense and does not 
want to see an Iraqi. They deported the head of the Iraqi 
interests section without any legal or diplomatic justification 
because they are upset by any Iraqi presence in Washington, 
though very limited. They do not want to see an Iraqi. We go 
there for a week and meet with media men and television 
correspondents. In my opinion, this provides an opportunity for 
an Iraqi minister to explain the situation to the U.S. 
businessmen. Some U.S. businessmen used to deal with Iraq 
normally. We bought from them merchandise and agricultural 
crops such as grain, meat, and many other civilian products. 
They have all lost the Iraqi market. They are talking in U.S. 
circles about their losses and how long this situation will 
continue.

  [Text] Dr. 'Abd-al-Mun'im Ahmad Salih, minister of awqaf 
and religious affairs, has valued the Revolution Command Council 
[RCC] Decree No. 59, issued on 4 June, stipulating the 
amputatation of the thief's right hand at the wrist. 
  The minister told INA's correspondent the decree is in line 
with God's Book and the provisions of the Islamic Law and in 
harmony with God's words: As to the thief, male or female: Cut 
off his or her hands, a punishment by way of example, from God, 
for their crime, and God is exalted in power. [Koranic verse] 
  The minister added that this legislation is appropriate to 
address the robbery cases noted in the decree and that the 
issuance of the decree is in line with the campaign of faith and 
jihad led by the faithful leader struggler President Saddam 
Husayn and to remedy the crimes of theft. 
  He noted that the rule of God is better than all other rules 
in achieving deterrence that immunizes society against crime. 
He asserted that the RCC decree is in implementation of God's 
rule. 
  But who, for a people whose faith is assured, can give 
better 
judgment than God? [Koranic verse]

<F P=106> [Article by Mazhar 'Arif: "Front Against Front"] </F>
  [Text] In the fifties, some people in Iraq and other Arab 
states held the view that it was better to avoid provoking 
imperialism through demonstrations and other acts of protest. 
Those who held this view were mainly liberals who advocated 
compromise solutions with the ruling regimes which were linked 
in one way or another with imperialist forces. The liberals 
claimed that the more the people intensified their resistance to 
imperialist agents and imperialism itself, the more the agents 
and their overlords increased their oppression of the people and 
prolonged foreign domination of Iraq and other Arab states. 
Despite their call for peaceful action represented by 
addressing nicely written petitions to the monarchy on some 
public demand and dispatching delegations to key government 
officials, or to the British Embassy in Baghdad, for instance, 
concerning some issue of public interest, such as calling for an 
end to British influence in and domination of Iraq, our liberal 
friends were not spared persecution, arrest, imprisonment, and 
even exile by those royal governments. 
  Many of those liberal ideas found their way into political 
action of a different kind in Egypt under the late President 
Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir. Before the June War, the Egyptian 
leadership was advised not to provoke the Zionist entity and to 
use diplomacy in resolving the Arab-Zionist conflict. Strangely 
enough, the Soviet Union itself was one of those who offered 
such advice. Following the Arab defeat in that war, many 
people, both friends and foes, began saying: We advised 
'Abd-al-Nasir, but he did not listen to our advice, hence the 
defeat. Actually, 'Abd-al-Nasir listened to Soviet and French 
advice. It was the Zionist entity which did not care and was 
not ready to hear anything other than the voice of racism, 
aggression, occupation, and the overthrow of 'Abd-al-Nasir's 
regime. 
  It is understood that the Soviets also advised Iraq not to 
provoke the United States and the West by nationalizing oil. 
The nationalization decision which was drafted by struggler 
Saddam Husayn was the strongest and most important of all. The 
Soviets repeated their stand in the period before and after the 
Nazi military aggression on Iraq. This time, however, it was 
charged with ill-intention and evil. It came under Gorbachev, 
not under Podgorny in 1967 or Brezhnev during the 
nationalization days in 1972. 
  The position taken by the public throughout those years to 
this day, especially in Iraq, is to reject the ridiculous idea 
about not provoking the enemies and opponents, as the liberal 
circles should have described them. Enemies are essentially 
provokers against the people, the homeland, independence, and 
national sovereignty of Iraq or any other country which upholds 
similar principles. Were it not for the belief in these 
principles and their efficacy, their revolutions would not have 
succeeded and victories would not have been achieved in this 
country or any other country. The experiences of Egypt under 
al-Sadat and Mubarak, the experiences of other Arab states, and 
the experiences of 'Arafat with "Israel" all indicate the 
disastrous course followed by all those Arab sides, which 
finally led them to surrender to the imperialist and Zionist 
forces. 
  The escalation of Iraqi action on the political and media 
levels against the United States, the West, and the Arab forces 
which are allied to the imperialists is not only consistent with 
great Iraq's spirit of challenge against all those quarters as 
embodied in the glorious word "no", which leader Saddam Husayn 
has uttered and with which he expressed the steadfastness of the 
people and the homeland against the blockade, but also 
harmonious with the principles of the great 17-30 July 
Revolution and the principles of Saddam Husayn, the engineer of 
the revolution and its leader to the end. 
  Our dispute with the different enemies is a deep one. The 
solution of this dispute is only possible on the basis of those 
enemies recognizing Iraq's right to freedom, independence, and 
progress, not on any other basis as the aggressors and their 
collaborators want and imagine. Perhaps, the enemies' 
insistence on harming Iraq despite its implementation of the 
so-called "UN resolutions" is proof that the hostile stand 
against our country has not changed. This calls for a similar 
stand at all times. They did not lay down their political, 
military, and economic weapons against us, and therefore we must 
continue to use the weapon of information and steadfastness 
against the aggressors from now and until they are forced to 
change their stand against us.

  [Excerpt] Following the bold initiative announced by 
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK] Secretary General Jalal 
Talabani to normalize the situation in Kurdistan and remove all 
manifestations of tension and conflict in the relations between 
the two allied parties -- the PUK and the Unified Kurdistan 
Democratic Party [KDP] -- Talabani and KDP leader Mas'ud Barzani 
held a meeting in Shirin Palace Hotel in Irbil yesterday. The 
meeting was attended by members of the political bureaus of the 
two allied parties; Dr. Ahmad al-Jalabi, chairman of the 
executive council of the Unified Iraqi National Congress, the 
INC; and Major General Hasan al-Naqib, member of the INC 
Presidium Council. 
  During the meeting several important resolutions were issued 
regarding the withdrawal of the forces of the two parties and 
the establishment of an operations room in al-Sulaymaniyah 
including the PUK, KDP, INC, and the Islamic Movement. 
  It is worth noting that this important meeting took place 
two 
days after the historic speech delivered by PUK Secretary 
General Jalal Talabani to establish security and stability in 
Kurdistan. In this speech, brother Talabani announced an 
initiative for a unilateral cease-fire and the withdrawal of the 
PUK forces. 
  At the end of the meeting, Dr. Fu'ad Ma'sum, Sami 
'Abd-al-Rahman, and Dr. Ahmad al-Jalabi held a news conference 
attended by representatives of the media establishments in 
Kurdistan and foreign correspondents. Answering a question on 
the position of the Islamic Movement in Kurdistan, Dr. Fu'ad 
Ma'sum, active member of the PUK Political Bureau, said: It was 
decided that if the Islamic Movement abides by the cease-fire 
decision, the two parties will show their readiness to disengage 
their forces under the supervision of the operations room. If 
the Islamic Movement persists in its previous positions, it will 
be held responsible for the events by the two parties--that is, 
the PUK and KDP. In this case, we in the PUK and the KDP must 
defend the areas of Kurdistan, and the regional government must 
also carry out its duty. 
  It should be noted that brother Talabani and Dr. Ahmad 
al-Jalabi have held a bilateral closed meeting to discuss the 
situation. 
  Meanwhile, there was wide-scale reaction to brother 
Talabani's initiative from regional and international circles.

  [Text] Mas'ud Barzani, leader of the Kurdistan Democratic 
Party in Iraqi Kurdistan, met in Irbil today with Shaykh 'Uthman 
'Abd-al-'Aziz, leader of the Islamic Movement in Kurdistan. 
Barzani said that implementing a cease-fire in northern Iraq is 
not possible without 'Uthman's approval. 
  An Islamic Movement spokesman reported that the two leaders 
emphasized their united position on the current fighting in 
Iraqi Kurdistan. 
  The spokesman added that they also discussed the cease-fire 
in Irbil and the prospect of forming an executive committee, 
made up of representatives of the three warring parties in 
northern Iraq and the Iraqi National Congress, to implement a 
cease-fire in al-Sulaymaniyah.

<F P=106> ["Together on the Road" column by Dr. Fa'iz al-Sa'igh] </F>
  [Text] The "victories" the Yemeni leaders are achieving 
against other Yemeni leaders in the bloody battles on Yemeni 
territory call for great disgust. How can one Yemeni attack his 
Yemeni brother before the whole world in this way? How can the 
Yemeni generations accept the justifications made by both 
parties, with each party standing in its own bastion and trench, 
in defense of everything except the Yemeni unity? How can 
Yemeni history be written in this black period of a unified 
state? 
  The Yemeni people throughout the unified homeland vehemently 
refuse to follow what is taking place. They also strongly 
condemn these battles, which are being falsely waged in the name 
of unity. Unity has nothing to do with either the style or the 
results of these battles, even if they lead to comprehensive 
Arab unity. 
  What heinous crime is being committed on the land of the 
"miserable Yemen" in the name of unity? How can one Yemeni 
soldier stand to see body of another Yemeni soldier on the side 
of the road while expressing the "victory" smile and waving the 
"victory" sign with two fingers in the same way that led the 
Palestine question to the "Jericho farm" or the Jericho enclave, 
as some prefer to call it. 
  Anyone who hears and follows the hysterical statements and 
counter statements, and who counts the victories achieved by 
this party against that, will realize the extent of enmity 
harbored deep inside these souls and the extent of self-hatred 
and rancor held against the homeland. Had there been no 
remnants of pan-Arab commitment, these people would have been 
denied their Arabism, Islamic affiliation, and even their 
affiliation with this dear homeland and this good land. We 
testify that the man on this good land is pure and chaste. 
Moreover, harm is done to this land's history and civilization 
whenever a wound bleeds or whenever its calm nature is disturbed 
by a gunshot, whether it is stray or fatal. 
  Yemen is dying in the name of unity. The Yemeni leaders are 
vying with one another to fire the "bullet of mercy" at an 
exhausted body [Yemen] whose history is angry with those who led 
it to this disastrous fate. I do not believe that anyone can 
say that I support one renegade against another. This is 
because both renegades are bitter. Both renegades are leading 
to a dark tunnel for the miserable Yemen in which chaos is 
prevailing. Everything in the two Yemens, or rather in the 
several "Yemens" will be black until further notice or until 
another generation comes. 
  Brothers, unity between two countries is an intellectual 
dialogue and a spiritual convergence, not to mention unity among 
the sons of one country, the one Yemen, and the one heart. Is 
it really for the sake of unity that the Yemenis are fighting 
each other, storming others' homes, and attacking others' 
families? Or is it rather through this fighting that the 
Yemenis are actually driving an eternal nail in the coffin of 
the comprehensive Arab unity? This unity rejects such storming 
operations and victories. Unity requires a dialogue that will 
establish the kind of future for which the generations aspire. 
Let this farce stop before the world, and let its pioneers 
bring themselves to trial before the tribunal of history. Long 
live the unity of Yemen.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] In a commentary today, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH 
writes on the fighting raging in Yemen. It stresses that this 
war, which is not in the interest of Yemen or its people, could 
have been averted. 
  After explaining the effects of this war on Yemen's economy, 
AL- THAWRAH calls on the Yemeni leadership to rise to the level 
of its national and pan-Arab responsibility, and to respond to 
the homeland's call and the UN Security Council's demand to stop 
the massacres and destruction. 
  The Yemeni people, who are concerned about unity, are 
certain 
that what is taking place is not for the sake of unity, which 
they chose and sought for their future so that they might enjoy 
safety, security, and progress in all walks of life. 
  AL-THAWRAH stresses that the continuation of this war 
threatens the fabric of the Yemeni homeland by fomenting 
sedition and hostility among the sons of the one homeland. 
  Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: The Yemeni leadership must take 
into consideration the results of continued fighting in terms of 
casting doubts on the possibility of achieving Arab unity, and 
consequently, damaging the credibility of the principle of Arab 
unity, and harming the Arabs' image in the world.

<F P=106> ["Opinion" column: "The British Decision" by Ahmad Suwan] </F>
  [Text] The British Government's decision to end the ban on 
arms shipments to Israel is objectionable not only because it 
was made against the backdrop of unmistakable Israeli 
intransigence in the peace process, but also because it 
symbolizes brazen support for the Israeli entity's terrorist and 
coercive practices in the West Bank and Gaza and in south 
Lebanon. The reason that prompted the ban in the first place is 
still there, the 1982 Israeli invasion of south Lebanon. The 
combination of air raids, strafing, piracy, abductions, combing 
of towns and villages and their devastation and depopulation is 
an invasion in another guise. By lifting the arms embargo on 
Israel, the United Kingdom is, in effect, rewarding the Israeli 
aggressors and furnishing them with the means to bolster their 
superiority and pursue their recklessness and acts of terror and 
aggression. 
  Advancing an alibi for removing the embargo, the United 
Kingdom cited "encouraging developments in the peace process, 
specifically the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho", to 
quote British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. More 
surprisingly, London has made lifting the arms ban on the Arabs 
conditional on the bilateral talks moving forward. The party 
that must take the blame for the failure of these talks to 
advance is Israel itself. This is an example of the double 
standard in UK policies -- one standard for Israel, another 
against the Arabs. 
  By ending the ban on arms sales to Israel and making its 
revocation regarding the Arabs conditional on the peace process 
making headway, the British Government has set a serious 
precedent in international relations. Britain has underscored 
its blind bias toward Israel, its aggressive and terrorist 
policies, and has stabbed the Arabs and their worthy causes. 
The British Government defended its decision by citing 
encouraging developments, sidestepping the facts and the 
substance of the peace process. Just what are these 
developments that prompted this decision? Do they include the 
substitution of Israeli withdrawal as stipulated by UN Security 
Council resolutions with the redeployment of forces provided for 
in the self-rule agreement? Is the continuing existence of 
Jewish settlements and consequently Israeli occupation an 
encouraging development? Does Israel's responsibility for 
security and political matters in the self-rule area or its 
control over roads, crossings, and bridges also rank as 
encouraging developments? Does the United Kingdom really rate 
these as truly encouraging developments, or is it knowingly and 
deliberately pursuing deceptive policies calculated to mislead 
world opinion and liquidate the Palestinian people's rights?! 
  The United Kingdom is all too aware that the self-rule plan 
does not meet the Palestinian people's aspirations. The United 
Kingdom is equally aware that Israel continues to cling to 
occupation, and thus is not eligible for any reward. Nor should 
Israel's repressive machine be rewarded for its savagery and 
terror. It is not right that the Israeli military should be 
furnished with what it takes to pursue coercive and genocidal 
programs. 
  It is worthwhile to make one thing abundantly clear: 
Britain's pro-Israel stance is bound to further complicate 
things in the region. It would have been more helpful if 
Britain had acted to deter Israel's aggression and brought 
pressure to bear in the interest of making it comply with UN 
resolutions. The lifting of the arms embargo will only 
exacerbate Israel's excesses and intransigence and its rejection 
of the bases on which the peace process was launched. Britain 
should have acted to end Israel's recklessness and arrogance, 
and should have helped the cause of an even-handed and universal 
peace settlement in the Middle East.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ziyad Abu-Zayyad, "spokesman for </F>
the Palestinian leadership," by Rafi Rosenfeld; place not given; 
from the "It Is All Talk" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Rosenfeld] In connection with the Peres letter, 
the Israelis feel that 'Arafat made a mountain out of a 
molehill. The government is claiming that the letter merely 
guarantees the status quo of the Jerusalem institutions and 
nothing more. What do you say? 
  [Abu-Zayyad] I say that you have nothing better to do than 
make mountains out of molehills. The truth is that I am 
surprised at both the Israeli media and the Israeli politicians' 
preoccupation with this matter. I think Jerusalem is a very 
sensitive issue, and the constant discussion of it merely serves 
to complicate it and incite the sides against each other. 
Therefore, I think we -- both sides -- should drop the issue. 
In my opinion, the Palestinians should stop making political 
statements about Jerusalem, and the Israelis should do the same. 
At the same time, the closure should be lifted gradually, 
because what is inciting the Palestinians is the continued 
closure and the suffering to which the Arabs have been subjected 
in the context of Jerusalem. 
  [Rosenfeld] Your remarks imply a great affinity between the 
Israeli Government and the Palestinian leadership on the issue 
of Jerusalem. Could this affinity be the result of some other 
secret addenda? 
  [Abu-Zayyad] Listen, as far as I know, there are no secret 
addenda. I have noticed that the Israeli opposition has been 
trying to attack the government and turn the Israeli people 
against the government and the peace process. All those who 
support the peace process and desire peace should be 
sufficiently alert to distinguish between malicious 
pronouncements intended to agitate and those made sincerely. 
  [Rosenfeld] Ziyad Abu-Zayyad, there is one point I would 
like to clarify with you. We heard this morning that the 
Palestinian leaders have a copy of the letter to the Norwegian 
foreign minister, but with one difference: Your copy is dated 
one month earlier than the one that was sent to Foreign Minister 
Holst. 
  [Abu-Zayyad] First of all, although I know a lot and am 
involved in many facets of Palestinian politics, I have neither 
seen nor heard about such a letter. I do not know where you 
obtained your information about the letter in 'Arafat's 
possession. 
  [Rosenfeld] It was reported on the radio this morning. 
  [Abu-Zayyad] Listen, Israeli radio and press publish lots of 
unsubstantiated and unfounded reports. 
  [Rosenfeld] Are you saying that although you have not seen 
it, it may exist? 
  [Abu-Zayyad] My not having seen it does not mean that it 
does not exist, but what I am telling you is that we must treat 
press and radio reports cautiously, because there are many 
unfounded reports. 
  [Rosenfeld] Now to two ostensibly technical questions. 
Peres said this morning that if the Palestinians conduct 
Palestinian affairs from Orient House in East Jerusalem, the 
place will be closed. Are you conducting autonomy affairs from 
there? 
  [Abu-Zayyad] Orient House was launched as part of the 
overall peace process, and it will continue to operate in that 
capacity. 
  [Rosenfeld] I do not understand. Are you saying that 
Palestinian autonomy matters will be run from there? 
  [Abu-Zayyad] No, definitely not. I do not see how you could 
have understood that. As I told you, Orient House started 
operating right after the Madrid Conference within the broad 
framework of the peace process. It does not belong in the 
autonomy, it is not part of the autonomy, and its offices are 
not autonomy offices. Orient House will continue to operate as 
it did before the Gaza-Jericho agreement, and it will continue 
to operate even after the Gaza- Jericho agreement is 
implemented. Now, the Gaza-Jericho agreement stipulates that 
the central Gaza-Jericho authority will be in Jericho, and there 
is no argument about that. Thus, the Palestinian self-rule 
institutions that will be established in Gaza and Jericho will 
naturally be situated in Gaza and Jericho. 
  [Rosenfeld] I have another technical question, Ziyad 
Abu-Zayyad. Minister Shahal said this morning that if any 
security officers operate in East Jerusalem, they will be 
detained. Are there any such officers? 
  [Abu-Zayyad] There are none. To put it briefly and 
unequivocally: There are no Palestinian security officers in 
East Jerusalem. There are security guards situated inside 
Orient House, and their work is connected solely to Orient 
House. They are under clear, unequivocal orders precluding 
their operation outside Orient House. You may see one of them 
still wearing his clothes with an Orient House emblem on his way 
home, but it does not mean that he is on duty or that he is 
patrolling the area or on duty. We are fully aware of the legal 
aspects of the activity of these people, and they will not 
attempt to exceed the limits of their authority. 
  [Rosenfeld] Thank you very much, Ziyad Abu-Zayyad.

<F P=106> [Report by Qol Yisra'el correspondent Sa'id Mu'addi; from </F>
the "With the Midday Events" program -- italicized passages are 
recorded] 
  [Text] Police Minister Moshe Shahal has renewed his past 
regular meetings with Faysal al-Husayni following the imposition 
of a security cordon on the territories and the appointment of 
al-Husayni as PLO official in charge of following up the 
situation in Jerusalem. Shahal's meeting with al-Husayni came 
at a time of media clamor and exchanged accusations between the 
government and opposition parties against the backdrop of the 
letter Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres sent to his Norwegian 
counterpart late Jorgen Holst. During his meeting with 
al-Husayni, Minister Shahal underscored the government's 
position on the current crisis. 
  Talking about this meeting, al-Husayni adds: He also 
raised the issue of the existing relationship, the political 
process, the status of Jerusalem, and all related matters. 
  Regarding the Palestinian viewpoint on the contents of the 
letter Shim'on Peres sent on the status of the Palestinian 
institutions, al-Husayni says: Yes, this is the way we 
understand the letter. We believe that the subject of Jerusalem 
or negotiations on the future of Jerusalem will take place in 
the second phase. Until then, the status of these institutions 
and the importance of Arab presence in Jerusalem should be 
maintained. The letter is with the Israelis, Norwegians, and 
the PLO. It was considered secret. Consequently, it is not with 
us. But since it was announced, I think we can obtain it. 
  Orient House has in the past served as a starting point for 
several activities on the peace process, including the 
preparation of working papers for the Washington talks. 
  Orient House is a Palestinian institution. Many 
activities on the political process as a whole sprang from it. 
These activities are completely linked to the political 
process, that is, to a comprehensive solution, God willing. As 
for partial solutions like the issue of the national authority 
in Gaza and Jericho first, these are partial and not 
comprehensive. Consequently, Orient House remains in its place 
doing the same services it used to do until we enter the final 
stage and until we reach a final solution, God willing. 
  Regarding the meeting held at Orient House yesterday evening 
in the presence of several Palestinian political and religious 
figures, Faysal al-Husayni says: The situation in 
Jerusalem was reviewed. The problems facing us, including the 
closure of Jerusalem from the rest of the occupied Palestinian 
areas and the financial problems facing some institutions, were 
also reviewed. We also discussed the current crisis of these 
institutions and this controversy between us and the Israelis as 
well as the sensitivity of the subject and the need to address 
it without creating useless side battles. I was asked to follow 
up the establishment of this committee [not further identified] 
in order to follow up all issues related to the Palestinian 
institutions and Palestinian citizens.

  [Text] General Nasr Yusuf, commander of the Palestinian 
police force, has ordered all the imams in Gaza Strip mosques to 
halt all political activity in the mosques and to stop issuing 
calls against the autonomy authorities over loudspeakers. Our 
correspondent Nisim Qeynan reports that Nasr Yusuf also ordered 
to shut down the mosques after the last daily prayer, which 
usually ends at 2100. He also warned the imams against 
nonreligious activity in the mosques. The Islamic movement in 
the Gaza Strip has expressed opposition to and anger over 
Yusuf's directives and over the fact that the Palestinian police 
is hampering its activity. 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1130 GMT on 6 June adds: 
"Nasr Yusuf, commander of the Palestinian police in Gaza, has 
been removed from his position as the Palestinian national 
security commander [as heard], apparently against the background 
of the sharp verbal clashes between him and Hamas (Islamic 
Resistance Movement). He will be replaced by 'Abd-al-Razzaq 
al-Majayirah, who headed the Palestinian delegation for security 
talks with Israel. Recently there have been sharp clashes 
between Nasr Yusuf and extremist Muslims in Gaza against the 
background of Yusuf's demand to disarm Hamas and Islamic Jihad 
activists, and also in the wake of the incarceration of Hani 
al-'Abd, an Islamic Jihad activist. This is reported by our 
Arab Affairs correspondent Oren Kohen."]

<F P=106> [By Maryam M. Shahin] </F>
  [Text] Gaza City -- Every day hundreds of people gather 
outside the headquarters of the Palestinian police force waiting 
to meet with officials. Carrying papers and a request of some 
sort, they seek to make their first contact with Palestinian 
authorities, who they hope, will begin to solve some of their 
problems. 
  But the Gaza police headquarters, with only 500 policemen at 
its immediate disposal, is completely overworked. 
  "Our priorities are law and order, to clean up Gaza and to 
help set the ground-work for a civic society," said the overall 
commander of all military units in Gaza, Major General Nasir 
Yusuf. 
  Meeting delegation after delegation of well-wishers and 
people with complaints in his spartan office overlooking the 
Mediterranean Gen. Nasir is visibly tired, keeping a 
dawn-to-midnight office schedule. 
  The return to Palestine is much harsher than expected by 
Gen. 
Nasir and most other Palestinians here. The 500 policemen 
stationed in Gaza and 3,500 other members of the Palestinian 
National Security Forces (PNSF) as well as the two investigative 
branches of the armed forces have not been paid in months. 
Housing is extremely sparse and most of the policemen and PNSF 
members are still being dined by Gazans' in on-going gestures of 
welcome. 
  But Gen. Nasir comes straight to the point. "We have not 
received sufficient promised equipment and aid from the donors," 
he said. According to Gen. Nasir almost none of the promised 
aid with the exception of blue police-uniforms and some weapons 
have reached the police force. 
  "The communications equipment, the cars, the office 
furniture 
have not materialised. I don't know how the donors expect us to 
work," says Gen. Nasir with a tone of frustration. 
  A tour of several police stations showed that the furniture 
has been donated by local Gazans. The sanitary conditions of 
police and army bases left behind by Israel are "unacceptable" 
and belied Israeli prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's statement 
promising to leave well-kept and well-equipped stations behind 
for the Palestinians. 
  No furniture was left behind. Sewage systems are being 
totally renewed, creating some work for Gazan plumbers. 
  Last week newspaper ads called on eligible Palestinians to 
join the Palestinian police. 
  "We waited so far because we can't train people without some 
equipment. So we want to start recruitment in the hope that the 
needed equipment will arrive soon. The donors in Cairo and Oslo 
signed papers but thus far have done very little follow-up 
work," said Gen. Yusuf. 
  Palestinian policemen are being driven to their posts by the 
PNSF members in their American-provided khaki coloured Chevrolet 
jeeps. 
  Gaza, says Gen. Nasir, needs some 3,000 policemen. The 
"requirements" listed in the local newspapers for a policeman is 
that he be between 18 and 25 years of age, have a secondary 
school certificate, be of two Palestinian parents, be of good 
"national character" and agree to serve 12 years in the police 
force. 
  Most of the serving policemen where either policemen during 
Egyptian and later Israeli rule or men conscripted outside the 
occupied territories specifically for police work. 
  Its purpose is to control traffic and deal with civic issues 
and register and act on complaints about crime. 
  So far there has not been much crime, but at the police 
headquarters in the southern part of the Strip in Khan Yunus, 
eight men have already been arrested on charges ranging from 
theft to rape. Four men each sit in cells which measure five 
metres by five metres and the local police chief allows 
journalists to take a peek to observe the clean conditions of he 
cells. Photographs, however, are not allowed. 
  Prior to the arrival of the Palestinian police, crimes were 
punished through the intervention of local notables or tribal 
leaders or through retaliations, says Gen. Nasir. "Now people 
come and report to us and we must act fast to show that we can 
take control and make people feel secured by our presence." 
  But most of the work that Gaza policemen have to deal with 
is 
either traffic control or land complaints. 
  When not directing the rather chaotic traffic in Gazan towns 
and refugee camps, policemen dutifully sit at their desks and 
register land complaints. 
  Since the Israeli occupation began in 1967 land registration 
stopped; 27 years later issues of inheritance and family feuds 
over inheritance is by far the most prominent police-related 
issue for many Gazans. 
  "These land issues are taking up a lot of our time. Soon a 
judiciary will be in place to deal with them in a more concrete 
form. We are being a bit overburdened by these issues because 
we have very little power to make legal decisions of this kind 
-- once these decisions are taken we can implement them," said 
Gen. Yusuf.

  [Text] Tunis, June 4 (AFP) -- A group of 158 officers and 
officials of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) left 
here Friday [3 June] night aboard a special flight to Cairo 
en-route for the autonomous Gaza Strip. 
  It was the first large contingent of Palestinian exiles 
based 
in Tunis to return to the territories vacated by Israel to be 
placed under Palestinian self-rule . 
  The 158 who are officially part the Palestine Liberation 
Army, the PLO's military arm, were mainly officials who had 
served for the last few years in the PLO's various civilian 
departments. 
  Some who had never worn a uniform seemed ill at ease in the 
green military fatigues offered by the Tunisian authorities. 
  The group included six Palestinian journalists, some of whom 
will man the first bureau in Gaza of the Palestinian news agency 
WAFA. Others will join the Palestinian television service now 
under construction. 
  The contingent left for Cairo on a Tunisian aircraft 
chartered by Saudi Arabia. The group will travel by bus from 
Cairo to the border and will cross over into Gaza at Rafah on 
Sunday. 
  Several senior Palestinian officials, including the 
Palestinian ambassador in Tunis Hakam Bal'awi and Ahmad Quray' 
(Abu-'Ala'), economics "minister" of the new Palestinian 
Authority took part in a farewell ceremony at Tunis airport. 
  A Palestinian source said 20 security agents trained in 
Tunisia or in other countries had left Tunis since Thursday for 
the Gaza Strip and the other autonomous territory of Jericho on 
the West Bank. 
  So far, 3,500 Palestinian policemen have been deployed in 
the 
two territories which PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat is scheduled to 
visit in the middle of June. 
  "The next step is to repatriate the political cadres to Gaza 
and Jericho," a senior PLO official told AFP Friday. 
  Abu-'Ala' told journalists that promised funds from 
international donors must be forthcoming quickly, saying the 
lack of resources was causing serious anxiety to Palestinians. 
  "Without the means there can be no security," he said. 
  Thirty-one of the officials' family members had left earlier 
Friday by a scheduled flight to Cairo. 
  The leader of the contingent, Colonel Samih Nasr, 46, said 
he 
hoped to have the means "to defend the dignity and institutions" 
of the new Palestinian authority. 
  He denied that the Palestinian police would be repressive, 
saying "that is not our aim."

<F P=106> [Report by the Abrar Media office in Gaza] </F>
  [Text] In an exclusive statement to AL-QUDS, Shaykh 
'Abdallah al-Shami, a prominent figure close to the Islamic 
Jihad in Gaza, has said that the group has recently been engaged 
in a political dialogue to find some formula for action through 
a political front [wajihah siyasiyah] that would avoid clashes 
with the Palestinian self-rule authority. 
  The cadres of the movement have almost unanimously agreed to 
establish a formula for public political, social, and cultural 
action through which the Islamic Jihad can perform its Islamic 
duty to further the Palestinian cause, he said. 
  Shaykh al-Shami, who served as the official spokesman for 
the 
Islamic Jihad deportees in Marj al-Zuhur in Lebanon, said the 
public front will not be a substitute for, but a backer of, the 
Islamic Jihad. 
  Asked if this political front will also be active in the 
West 
Bank areas that are not under the authority of the Palestinian 
self-rule council, Shaykh al-Shami explained that the 
establishment of the front is linked to the circumstantial 
change: the launching of the Palestinian self-rule authority. 
The front will operate only in the Palestinian autonomous 
region, he said. 
  Shaykh al-Shami believes the front will be open to all 
Palestinians who embrace Islam, are committed to it, and who 
work for the Palestinian cause. 
  On the possibility of the leaders of this front 
participating 
in the upcoming elections for the self-rule council, Shaykh 
al-Shami said it is not necessary for every political party or 
political front to participate in all elections or in the 
executive power. 
  Our clear political position, he said, is not to participate 
in the institutions of the self-rule, which the Islamic Jihad 
has opposed from the very beginning. 
  Asked about the issue of Hani 'Abid, a journalist close to 
the Islamic Jihad who has been detained by the Palestinian 
authorities for more than 10 days, al-Shami said that after 
several meetings between Palestinian security leaders and 
figures close to the Islamic Jihad, the Palestinian security 
leadership promised to release 'Abid within a few days. 
However, this did not happen and the Islamic Jihad is waiting 
for them to keep their promises, he said.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with 'Arafat's adviser Dr. Ahmad </F>
al-Tibi by Smadar Peri in al-Tibi's home "earlier this week"] 
  [Text] We should fall from our chairs in astonishment if 
in another two years, on the eve of the next Knesset elections, 
a new-old name appears in the lists of candidates: Dr. Ahmad 
al-Tibi -- an Israeli Arab, a gynecologist, and PLO leader Yasir 
'Arafat's Israeli adviser ("sometimes I speak on the phone with 
the honorable chairman two or three times a day"). 
  "An interesting place, the Knesset," he wittily said earlier 
this week in a bid to mask his plans. "The heads of several 
Arab local councils in the Negev and the north called on me and 
urged me to found up a new movement." 
  [Peri] And what did you tell them? 
  [Al-Tibi] I did not say either yes or no. As far as I am 
concerned, you can write "he did not slam the door on them." 
  [Peri] And what if your friend Hayim Ramon were to run in a 
separate list in the Knesset elections and propose you join him? 
  [Al-Tibi] I appreciate Hayim Ramon very much and he is my 
friend, but such a move is not on the agenda. I do not see him 
running in a separate list. However, I would definitely like to 
be the Hayim Ramon of the Arab sector. 
  [Peri] Will you run for the Knesset alone? 
  [Al-Tibi] That is a weighty question which must be given 
proper consideration. 
  I listen to suggestions and hear rumors. Although there is a 
serious vacuum in the Arab leadership in Israel, I am presently 
busy with other issues. This is a gray and decadent leadership, 
an old generation which must be replaced. Some Arab Knesset 
members [MK] do not deserve the people's confidence. They have 
contributed nothing toward promoting the Arab sector, except for 
making minor headlines in local newspapers. 
  I foresee a change in the next Knesset elections. The Arab 
sector wants people with a track record and with influence. 
They want young leaders to replace these outdated men. [end 
al-Tibi] 
  In the meantime, he tries very hard to extinguish 'Arafat's 
fires. The hot cassette from Johannesburg begat two scandals, 
and al-Tibi reacted swiftly. Earlier this week he summoned a 
news conference in Haifa to explain to the Israeli people what 
the Quraish tribe and the Hudaybah Treaty were all about, and to 
emphasize that 'Arafat is not secretly conspiring to violate the 
agreement with Israel. 
  A busy week. When 'Arafat forces the Israeli people to learn 
chapters in the history of Islam, his Israeli adviser has to run 
back and forth between the newsreels on Qol Yisra'el and IDF 
Radio, talk shows on television, and a joint appearance with 
Yosi Beilin in the campus of Beersheba University. 
  Dozens of journalists phone him and get an answering machine 
on the other end. 'Arafat's adviser recognizes the voices and 
decides when to pick up the phone. 
  [Peri] How did the idea of appointing you as an adviser come 
about? 
  [Al-Tibi] Nine months ago, me and my wife May (a dentist 
from Tulkarm) were invited to Tunis. I was sitting in on an 
extended session of the PLO Executive Committee on the eve of 
the signing ceremony in Washington. 'Arafat took everybody by 
surprise when he announced: Out of appreciation for his 
contribution to the Palestinian people, I decided to appoint 
Ahmad as a special adviser on all matters pertaining to the 
Israeli issue. 
  [Peri] What does being 'Arafat's adviser mean? 
  [Al-Tibi] It means not sleeping regular hours, being busy 
all day with overt and covert contacts in Israel and abroad, 
preparing 'Arafat's meetings with Peres and Rabin, getting a 
phone call from 'Arafat at 0620 on the morning of the massacre 
in Hebron and hearing him yell: Tell Rabin and Peres that a 
horrible massacre is under way in the mosque. 
  It means that I have to sit in my office and listen to the 
grievances and problems of people, although this is not in my 
brief. People even come to me with problems such as family feuds 
and neighbor disputes. 
  As far as I am concerned, the main target audience of the 
Palestinian leadership are the people in Judaea and Samaria, and 
the Israeli public immediately afterward. Let me emphasize: We 
must be more understanding of the feelings of the Israeli people. 
  [Peri] What is the salary of 'Arafat's adviser? 
  [Al-Tibi] I have not received a cent since the appointment; 
neither a salary, nor reimbursement for phone calls and plane 
tickets. However, I do not complain. Others have not received 
anything either. I have a gynecological practice in East 
Jerusalem four-five times a week, and my wife earns a living for 
the two of us. According to my calculations, to date I have 
spent $52,000. How to put it? 'Arafat owes me. 
  [Peri] Do you believe you will ever get your money back? 
  [Al-Tibi] Two months ago I complained to 'Arafat that the 
bill was getting bigger and he smiled at me. "Go to Abu-Ahmad," 
he suggested. I smiled back at him. 
  [Peri] Who is Abu-Ahmad? 
  [Al-Tibi] He is my father, and he really helps me here and 
there. Now that there is an agreement, he is finally pleased 
about what I do. [end al-Tibi] 
  Al-Tibi is not everybody's pet. In Orient House, for 
example, he is known as "Ahmad Tizi." Our government ministries 
use other nicknames, most of them aimed at 'Arafat. Israeli 
Arabs are also quite critical of him, but four times already he 
was elected the most popular figure in public opinion polls in 
the Arab sector. 
  He is 36 years old, talented and smart as a whip, 
hard-working, sharp, and articulate in two languages. He is 
telegenic and relishes a good fight with our extreme right wing. 
His relationship with his old friend, MK Dedi Zucker, recently 
soured. 
  On the morning of the signing of the agreement on mutual 
recognition between Israel and the PLO in Washington, al-Tibi 
snuck into the Mayflower Hotel to the floor in which Rabin and 
Peres were staying. 
  At the last minute, an argument emerged over the 
identification of the signatories. Rabin demanded "the 
Palestinian delegation." Al-Tibi, speaking for 'Arafat, 
announced that if the agreement does not bear the word "PLO" 
'Arafat would stay in his hotel and there would be no signing. 
Al-Tibi made three shuttle trips between the hotels of the 
Israeli and the PLO delegations. When the bargaining was over, 
'Arafat had won. 
  Al-Tibi says that to be 'Arafat's adviser on Israeli affairs 
means to be attentive to feelings in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and 
the settlements; to update 'Arafat about the results of the 
Histadrut labor federation elections and their repercussions on 
our political map. At the same time, he has the impossible 
mission of improving 'Arafat's dismal image in Israel. 
  [Al-Tibi] I believe 'Arafat must take Israel's 
sensitivities toward him into account. After such a bloody 
conflict, 'Arafat should have considered Israel's sensitivities, 
just as Rabin and other Israelis should be attentive to our side. 
  [Peri] Do you think 'Arafat's talk about a jihad was right? 
  [Al-Tibi] Let me put it this way: 'Arafat should have known 
that the word jihad has belligerent connotations to the Jewish 
ear. We could have done without this sentence. 
  [Peri] You have not been very successful in improving 
'Arafat's image in Israel. Quite the contrary, his image is 
deteriorating by the day. 
  [Al-Tibi] I get the impression that politicians are trying 
to thrash 'Arafat left, right, and center in order to score 
points with the Israeli public. It is really an Israeli 
national sport. 
  [Peri] Tell us the secret: How did 'Arafat react to Rabin's 
and Peres' remarks that they cannot stand the contact of his 
hand? 
  [Al-Tibi] I do not want to say how he reacted, but he 
definitely did not jump for joy. [end al-Tibi] 
  All sorts of patients come to Dr. al-Tibi's clinic on 
Salah-al-Din Street in East Jerusalem: Palestinian women, 
members of the diplomatic and UN corps, Israeli women from 
Jerusalem's Rehavya and Pisgat Ze'ev and even from the 
settlements who first met al-Tibi when he worked at Hadassah 
Hospital and lived in the Neve Ya'aqov neighborhood. ("I ran 
away from there after one year because I could not afford to 
replace dozens of slashed tires, and I got fed up of hearing 
that I was a dirty Arab.") 
  Perhaps, the epitome of normalization is taking place in the 
gynecological field: young women whose families are identified 
with Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] are being referred 
through "discreet channels" to Israeli gynecologists in Tel Aviv 
and Petah Tiqva for hymen reconstruction surgery. It seems the 
young women only trust Israeli gynecologists to be discreet, 
keep their privacy, and see to it that they can marry 
respectably. 
  On the walls of the living room of his rented apartment in 
Bayt Hanina hang framed photographs of al-Tibi with 'Arafat, 
Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas], Faruq Qaddumi, Hakam Bal'awi, and 
Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh. There is also a historic photograph of 
'Arafat, al-Tibi, and Nayif Hawatimah, leader of the 
rejectionist Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine. 
It was al-Tibi who managed to bring Hawatimah and 'Arafat 
together two years ago. They have not met since then, and 
Hawatimah keeps firing verbal barbs at 'Arafat. 
  However, what al-Tibi considers the jewel in his crown, the 
real cherry on the cake, is closing a circle of at least 10 
years between Weizman ("the president of my state") and 'Arafat 
("the president of my people"). 
  [Al-Tibi] It was a dream that came true after 10 years. I 
am personally attached to both men. Weizman attended my wedding 
in Ramla, 'Arafat invited me and my wife to Tunis after our 
daughter Yara was born. 
  Weizman is the most prominent Israeli politician who was 
ahead of his time. When he talked about what everybody is doing 
today he took quite a lot of criticism. I, too, feel that I was 
ahead of my time and took quite a few blows. Who else in the 
Arab sector can pride himself of sharing a true friendship with 
Weizman, Sarid, Yosi Beilin, Hayim Ramon, and Eli Dayan? [end 
al-Tibi] 
  A specific phone call al-Tibi made six years ago from Tunis 
to Weizman's home in Caesarea almost led to the expulsion of 
Weizman, then a minister without portfolio, from the government. 
This week, al-Tibi discloses the full story behind that famous 
phone call. 
  [Al-Tibi] Six years ago, when Secretary of State Baker 
presented his five-point plan and the PLO responded with a 
categorical "no," I went to Tunis to try and soften the PLO's 
No. 2 man, Abu-Iyad [Salah Khalaf]. 
  I met Abu-Iyad and 'Arafat in Hakam Bal'awi's office. A 
stormy four-hour argument ensued, during which I insisted that 
instead of saying "no" they should say "yes, but." In the end, 
together with Sa'id Kamal, the PLO ambassador in Egypt, I 
managed to persuade them. 
  I proposed to fly back to Israel at once and relay the 
message to the Labor Party, but Abu-Iyad insisted: "Call 
Weizman from here and inform him." 
  I phoned Caesarea and said what I said. Weizman called Peres 
on the other line, and we had a conference call. Abu-Iyad and 
'Arafat were sitting and listening, but did not interfere in the 
conversation. When then-Prime Minister Yitzhaq Shamir learned 
about it, he hit the ceiling because the PLO's positive answer 
pushed him into a political corner. Shamir would have preferred 
that the PLO's reply had been negative. To punish me, he banned 
me from traveling abroad for two years, while Weizman was 
reprimanded by the head of the Shin Bet. [end al-Tibi] 
  The meeting between Weizman and 'Arafat in Johannesburg, 
after the drama 'Arafat caused in Cairo when he refused to sign 
the agreement, was rather cold. 
  [Al-Tibi] I felt good with the two of them, but I had been 
expecting a warmer meeting. After all, they knew each other 
well and had exchanged political and personal messages. 
  [Peri] The first meeting between Rabin and 'Arafat was also 
very tough. 
  [Al-Tibi] It is very hard to reach out to Rabin. With Peres 
it is easier. 
  [Peri] What did you want Rabin to think of 'Arafat, after 
being informed that 'Arafat was behaving like a man possessed, 
stamping his feet, screaming, and throwing a fit? 
  [Al-Tibi] Those publications left 'Arafat very bitter and 
helped him to get acquainted with the intricacies of Israeli 
politics and the incumbent officials in the Prime Minister's 
Office and the Foreign Ministry. And, believe you me, 'Arafat 
does not forget. The fact that he smiles to people does not 
mean anything. 
  [Peri] You probably rushed to inform 'Arafat what Rabin said 
two days ago about Netzarim, that "if this is a settlement, I am 
a monkey's uncle." 
  [Al-Tibi] Everything possible must be done to make the life 
of the settlers in the Gaza Strip unbearable through nonviolent 
means and to cause them to leave of their own free will. 
  [Peri] What do you mean by "nonviolent means?" 
  [Al-Tibi] I do not have to elaborate. [end al-Tibi] 
  Behind his back, people in Orient House say that he will 
soon 
find himself outside the picture, that 'Arafat will be done 
using him and will dump him. 
  [Al-Tibi] 'Arafat definitely crowns and dethrones people, 
but I will know when to step down before they get tired of me. 
Although I was offered, I do not see myself as part of the 
Palestinian Authority in the territories. I was offered a 
Palestinian passport, and I responded with a big smile. I see 
my future in al-Tayyibah. Contrary to others, I have a place to 
go. 
  [Peri] Will you retire quietly and dedicate yourself to your 
gynecological practice? 
  [Al-Tibi] I do not know. I have never forsaken Israel's 
Arabs, and all I have done to date has been designed to meet the 
avowed expectations of Israel's Arab population. At the same 
time, I will act in any way I can for the establishment of a 
Palestinian state. 
  [Peri] Do you envision yourself in the Knesset cafeteria in 
two years from now? 
  [Al-Tibi] I have been to the Knesset cafeteria more than 
once. The question is whether I will then be a guest or I will 
be inviting you as my guest.

<F P=106> [Report by Yosi Torpstein] </F>
  [Text] Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, who heads the Palestinian 
committee preparing the general elections in the territories and 
who was recently appointed minister of local government in the 
Palestinian Authority, stated on Friday [3 June] that the 
general elections for the establishment of a 100-member council 
would be held on 15 October and that the basic regulations of 
the elections would be completed by the end of this month. 
'Urayqat made these remarks in a conference of Palestinian and 
foreign journalists about Palestinian media and democracy in the 
new reality in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. 
  He added that the formulation of the Palestinian local 
government law would be completed by 15 July and that the 
establishment of municipality committees and village councils 
would be completed within less than a month, in time for the 
municipal elections. The Palestinian Authority will divide the 
territories into nine districts, he said, and the city of Gaza 
will be declared a district and will be split into four boroughs. 
  The conference held at the al-Watani Hotel in East Jerusalem 
is scheduled to end today. It was organized by the Palestinian 
Journalists Association and the International Journalists 
Association. The security forces banned 22 journalists -- who 
were supposed to participate -- from leaving the Gaza Strip, and 
the organizers lodged a protest with the authorities. 
  The issue of democratic structures under Palestinian 
self-rule was the key topic in the conference. Many 
participants expressed apprehension about the curtailment of the 
freedom of expression of Palestinian journalists in the 
territories and about government control of the media. 
  A letter sent by PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat, in which he 
promised to uphold democratic values and the peace process, was 
read at the beginning of the conference. "The Palestinian 
National Authority, which will run the affairs of our people 
until clean and general elections are held, will respect 
individual liberties, the freedom of thought, and the freedom of 
the press," 'Arafat stated. 
  Addressing the conference, Dr. 'Urayqat said that the 
Palestinian Authority does not plan to set up defense systems 
made up of aircraft, tanks, or missiles and that "the only way 
for the Palestinian people to survive the next 50 years is to 
embrace genuine democracy." 
  Radwan Abu-'Ayyash, head of the Palestinian Broadcasting 
Authority [PBA], said the PBA's operations would be based on the 
principles of freedom of expression and political pluralism and 
that contrary to the situation in sister countries in the Arab 
world, it would not be "a partisan apparatus or a government 
mouthpiece." 
  Abu-'Ayyash criticized the European Union for withholding 
the 
money it promised the PBA. He also accused Israel of holding up 
the release of technical equipment from customs and for holding 
up the allocation of broadcasting channels.

  [Text] Jericho, West Bank, June 7 (AFP) -- Palestinian 
television has gone on the air for the first time, broadcasting 
a test card, although the transmission was hampered by the fact 
that it came from one of the lowest spots on earth. 
  The Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation (PBC) for radio and 
television put out a trial television transmission late Monday 
beamed from a converted hotel. 
  The corporation's circular logo, bearing the letters PBC in 
English, followed by the name in Arabic and the Palestinian flag 
on the side, was to appear on television screens for 24 hours. 
  The initial transmission covered Jericho only, and was 
beamed 
from a hotel which has been turned into a press center for the 
visit of PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat, expected here later this month. 
  As technicians connected cables and put up giant aerials on 
the roof, painters and carpenters were hurriedly renovating the 
30-room building which has been closed to the public. 
  At a cost of around one million dollars, the television 
center's main function will be to cover 'Arafat's visit. 
Transmission to the rest of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip 
will be ready within a week, technicians promised. 
  After 'Arafat's visit is over, the station will continue to 
operate as a relay for the permanent broadcasting center, the 
location of which is at the centre of a dispute between Israel 
and the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
  The Palestinians want to set it up in the Israeli-occupied 
town of Ramallah, also on the West Bank, where a pre-1967 
Jordanian center stands. But Israel wants them to stay in 
Jericho. 
  "We are happy to see the word 'Palestine' on the screen," 
said corporation head Radwan Abu-'Ayyash. "We've been watching 
and listening to others, now it's time for others to listen to 
us." 
  It is the first ever Palestinian television station. Until 
recently, the PLO beamed radio programs from stations in Cairo, 
Baghdad and Tunis. 
  However, not all residents were able to tune in their sets 
to 
the new station which used a higher frequency channel than 
usual. Palestinian technicians said they may later adjust the 
channel for wider reception. 
  Among the many problems facing the new station is the 
location of Jericho. At more than 400 meters (1,300 feet) below 
sea level, this valley oasis is one of the lowest spots in the 
world and will make transmission difficult. 
  "Our plan was to have a main studio in Ramallah, connected 
with one in Gaza and one in Jericho," Abu-'Ayyash said. "Because 
we have no other choice, we will transmit from Jericho although 
it is terrible from such a low area." 
  He said two French-made boosting towers were to be placed on 
a surrounding mountain and on a nearby highway. Most of the 
small equipment and transmitters was bought from Israel. 
  A French-donated vehicle for external transmission, and 
other 
equipment donated by Germany are on their way to Jericho, he 
said. 
  The corporation's major headache however is a lack of funds. 
  Abu-'Ayyash said 55 million dollars were needed to establish 
the permanent broadcasting center and its studios, most of which 
have been promised by the European Union but not yet arrived. 
  "The money is locked up in Brussels," he said. "We have the 
skills and the goodwill. But we have a political problem with 
Israel, and without solving the political and money problems, we 
can't do much."

<F P=106> [Report by Salamah Ni'mat: "Al-Majali Unable To Carry Out </F>
Major Reshuffle of Jordanian Cabinet"] 
  [Text] Amman -- Reliable Jordanian political sources said 
yesterday that Prime Minister Dr. 'Abdal-Salam al-Majali has so 
far been unable to persuade a number of political figures to 
join his government in a major reshuffle he intended to carry 
out to enlarge the government's political base and contain 
opposition to his government's internal and foreign policies. 
  The sources added that al-Majali told people close to him 
that he would not be reshuffling his government "because many 
qualified political figures have refused to join that 
government." They noted that al-Majali "has renewed his 
accusations claiming that certain political forces considered 
loyal to some former prime ministers were trying to bring down 
the government," and that the government now has no clear vision 
regarding the question of the reshuffle which has been pending 
and which has resulted in "complete paralysis and chaos in 
government organs." 
  According to parliamentary sources, the efforts made by some 
ministers to pacify the House of Representatives' Financial 
Committee have failed. One of the committee members told 
AL-HAYAH that the committee "will not allow its members to be 
used in a government ploy to pass future decisions to raise the 
prices of water, electricity, and other services." The 
parliamentary sources emphasized that the government's future 
"is now in the hands of his majesty the king," who "might take 
surgical and dramatic steps." 
  The political circles are unanimous that al-Majali's failure 
to carry out a cabinet reshuffle means that the end is near for 
his government, perhaps not more than a few weeks away. 
Observers believe that al-Majali's government has been lumbered 
with some ministers who are seen as a burden on its shoulders 
and who have failed to promote basic relations with the National 
Assembly and the political parties. Some sources say that 
al-Majali had hoped to replace a number of ministers through a 
cabinet reshuffle, including First Deputy Prime Minister Dr. 
Ma'n Abu-Nuwar and Second Deputy Prime Minister and Education 
Minister Dr. Sa'id al-Tall, because of the reservations of the 
House of Representatives and political circles about their 
characters and political trends." [quotation marks as published] 
  Al-Majali's government has also been the target of severe 
criticism by senior Royal Court officials because of what they 
describe as the government's "excessive enthusiasm" for the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreements. They believe that "it would not 
be wise" to keep the present government because the peace 
process requires "a different strategy" for dealing with the 
future Palestinian entity in the occupied Arab territory.

<F P=106> [Report by Ahmad Shakir] </F>
  [Text] A major reshuffle of Prime Minister Dr. 
'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali's cabinet is expected tomorrow. The 
reshuffle will include 7-10 ministers. As is customary, all 
ministers will place their resignations at the disposal of the 
prime minister at a cabinet session today. Matters began to 
take shape after His Majesty King Husayn's visit to the Prime 
Ministry last Saturday, during which he presided over a cabinet 
meeting. He praised the government efforts and the ministers' 
services. It was reported that his majesty the king later paid 
a long visit to Prime Minister al-Majali at his home. 
  The statements obtained by reporters after his majesty's 
chairmanship of the cabinet meeting said that Jordan cannot much 
lag behind other peace tracks and that the challenges facing 
Jordan and the poor peace coordination with the Palestinian side 
require a cabinet reshuffle to include all political trends in 
the country in order to deal with the next phase. 
  Accordingly, Dr. al-Majali has over the last 48 hours held 
consultations with a number of deputies and senators in their 
capacity as representatives of the nation, and with various key 
figures and political trends so that the cabinet reshuffle will 
be based on a broader parliamentary base and will be acceptable 
to the various political trends. 
  It was reported that some deputies may participate in the 
government in their personal capacity. Other sources, however, 
said Prime Minister al-Majali's consultations with some deputies 
might have been confined to clarifying the various aspects of 
the Jordanian policy and the accelerating developments of the 
peace process and whether personalities from outside the House 
of Representatives are acceptable to the various political blocs 
and trends in the House. 
  It was reported that Dr. al-Majali contacted Senator Dhuqan 
al-Hindawi to appoint him deputy prime minister with large 
powers to run domestic affairs. However, sources close to 
al-Hindawi neither confirmed nor denied such reports. It was 
also reported that Dr. al-Majali, who is conducting most of his 
consultations from his home, has already met with some deputies 
and senators. Names from outside the House were mentioned to 
fill some portfolios. Some sources expected Marwan al-Qasim to 
be appointed deputy prime minister and minister of foreign 
affairs. The names of Dr. Raja'i al-Mu'ashshir, Jawdat 
al-Subul, 'Aql Biltaji, Dr. Muslih al-Tarawinah, and 
academicians from Jordanian universities and former ministers 
were also mentioned. 
  Once the cabinet reshuffle has taken place, major 
appointments will be made. These include the post of director 
general of the Radio and Television Corporation as well as 
changes in ambassadors, secretaries general [of ministries], and 
directors of state departments and institutions.

  [Text] The pro-western wing in the Jordanian Government has 
temporarily scored a partial success when it was decided to 
resume the Jordanian-Israeli talks in Washington today, Monday, 
and to reinvigorate the Jordanian-American-Israeli economic 
cooperation committee at the same time. 
  AL-MAJD has learned that this pro-western team, which claims 
concern for Jordanian interests, has sought the help of its 
friends in Washington, London, and elsewhere during the past two 
weeks in order to pressure the higher Jordanian authorities into 
abandoning the option of comprehensive solution, easing 
political and economic rapprochement with Syria and Lebanon, 
and, consequently, reactivating negotiations and normalization 
with the Israeli enemy and the Gaza-Jericho protectorate. 
  AL-MAJD has also learned that the higher authorities, known 
for their ability to deal with crises, have reluctantly given 
the pro- western team partial freedom to secure some sort of 
balance in Jordan's relations with the neighboring states on the 
eve of King Husayn's visit to Washington. 
  According to reliable sources, AL-MAJD can emphasize that 
Jordan will not go too far in its political and economic talks 
with the Israeli enemy and 'Arafat, and that the strategic 
option of the higher Jordanian authorities is still that of 
adherence to Arab coordination and attainment of a comprehensive 
solution. 
  AL-MAJD can also affirm that the higher authorities will not 
risk signing a separate peace treaty with the enemy as desired 
by the Israeli-American alliance--an alliance that is seeking to 
weaken the Arab negotiating position by attracting Jordan, 
terrorizing Lebanon, and singling out Syria.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Round Part of Whole"] </F>
  [Text) Jordan's decision to press ahead with negotiations 
on the Jordanian-Israeli peace track reflects, basically, two 
important considerations that our country as a whole has to take 
into account. 
  The first is our sense of great disappointment that Arab 
coordination has not really ever materialised or bore fruit. 
  Right from the start of the Madrid talks in October 1991 it 
was clear, following the Gulf war and the damage that the war 
inflicted on the Arab body politic, that the minimum level of 
Arab consensus had been lost. All those so-called Arab 
coordination sessions since then have been more of a public 
relations stunt than real team work. What has exacerbated the 
problem is Israel's explicit determination to strike separate 
deals on each of the peace tracks. Israel's first breakthrough 
was with the Palestinians, which drove a big wedge between the 
Palestine Liberation Organisation, PLO, on the one hand, and the 
other parties--Jordan, Syria, Lebanon--on the other. 
  The second important consideration is, now that the 
negotiations on the Syrian-Israeli track are only awaiting a 
final push, inevitably carrying with them the Lebanese, Jordan 
cannot afford to be left behind without any real bargaining 
chips in its hands. That situation, so many sensible Jordanians 
have argued, is not in the best interests of the country. Hence 
the necessity of the latest step to resume the talks in 
Washington today and perhaps to move them later to the region 
for practical purposes. 
  Needless to say, there is nothing that should stop Jordan 
and 
Israel from settling the issue of their common border in 
accordance to International law as embodied in the 1992 League 
of Nations terms of the British mandate over Palestine and 
Jordan. A settlement of this issue can then be turned into a 
crucial precedent, for Syria and Lebanon, and also the 
Palestinians, to follow. Nothing is more important here than 
for Israel to confine itself to internationally acknowledged 
boundaries, leaving in the process the occupied Arab territories 
to their rightful owners. The war issue is of course more 
complex. Israel has so far insisted that since water was scarce 
the two countries should embark on joint projects to generate 
new sources of water. That Jordan welcomes but only after it 
gets its rightful share of the joint resources. 
  What we hope will result from the Washington talks is 
concrete movement towards lasting and comprehensive peace in the 
region. If Jordan can get the Israelis to concede on Jordanian 
rights on borders and water, if it can get the Israelis to 
accept the principle of withdrawal from the occupied Arab 
territories, then those talks that are to be held in Washington 
tomorrow will be a major step towards achieving that peace.

  [Text] Amman (PETRA)--The chambers of industry of Moscow 
and Amman Sunday signed a memorandum of understanding and 
cooperation aimed at stimulating economic and trade relations. 
  Head of the Amman Chamber of Industry Khaldun Abu-Hassan 
said 
after the signing that the two sides agreed on exploring ways to 
launch joint industrial ventures and exchange information on 
organising trade fairs. 
  Russia and Jordan will also facilitate the missions of 
visiting businesspersons from either side and help them organise 
seminars and conferences designed to promote trade between the 
two countries, he added. 
  During the talks, held at the Amman Chamber of Industry, the 
two sides reviewed ways to boost the volume of trade and agreed 
on setting up related joint committee or a business council, Mr. 
Abu- Hassan said. 
  The head of the Russian team underlined his country's desire 
to set up joint investment companies with Jordanian 
businesspersons and the exchange of industrial expertise. 
  The Jordan News Agency PETRA, quoted the head of the team as 
saying that the Moscow chamber represents an area comprising 20 
million people and houses 34 per cent of the Russian 
technological industries which earn nearly 25 per cent of the 
gross national product (GNP). 
  At the outset of the meeting, Mr. Abu-Hassan presented a 
briefing on Jordanian industries, Jordan's trade with Russia and 
prospects for investments in the two countries. 
  Jordan has strong and growing relations with Russia in all 
fields and has been importing an average of $50 million worth of 
Russian products annually, against $37 million worth of 
Jordanian products, said Mr. Abu-Hassan. 
  "We look forward to increasing the volume of trade with 
Russia and launching joint industrial ventures in the two 
countries," added Mr. Abu-Hassan. 
  PETRA quoted the Amman Chamber of Industry chief as saying 
that the two countries have been exchanging food supplies, 
electrical appliances, construction material, furniture timber 
as well as computers.

  [Text] Amman--A few days after they were criticised for 
their "bias" coverage of the civil war in Yemen, Jordan's 
official media have stopped referring to forces of southern 
Yemeni leader Ali Salim al-Bid as "secessionists." 
  While they are still calling loyalists of Yemeni President 
Ali Abdallah Salih the "government forces," the media are now 
covering the activities and statements of the South Yemeni 
forces as those of the Yemen Socialist Party. 
  The media were last week severely criticised by a group of 
journalists and writers for their "biased coverage" of the 
five-week civil war in Yemen pitting the forces of Mr. Salih 
against those of Mr. al-Bid amidst little chances for a decisive 
military victory for either side. 
  In a letter to Minister of Information Jawad al-'Anani, the 
group urged a review of the media's policy in covering the 
Yemeni war and an end to its "encouragement of the illusion of a 
military solution" to the conflict in the Arabian Peninsula 
country. 
  This review seems to have taken place, said one observer. 
  A seasoned political analyst who held a number of cabinet 
portfolios in the past said: "It was harsh to refer to the 
southerners as secessionists and if this (position) has been 
reconsidered then it is a good thing." 
  Jordan has repeatedly denied having taken sides in the 
Yemeni 
conflict, defending the media's reference to the warring parties 
as "government" and "secessionists" as factual statements 
because Aden seceded from the Yemeni republic. 
  Many, however, questioned this argument, emphasising that 
Jordan should be extremely careful in maintaining its neutrality 
on the conflict because of the large role it had played in 
mediating between Mr. Salih and Mr. al-Bid before war erupted on 
May 4. 
  The Kingdom has said it will not interfere in internal 
affairs of Yemen but stressed its support for the integrity of 
Yemen and the unity of its people. 
  "We should encourge the spirit of unity and invite the 
spirit 
of unity and invite the southerners to maintain it but we should 
be careful not to antagonise he south," said the analyst, who 
demanded anonymity.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] Under the headline "The Security Council's 
Resolution Helps the Continuation of War," the newspaper 
AL-ASWAQ says: The UN Security Council was not expected to 
condemn the secession in Yemen because it did not meet for this 
purpose in the first place. The preparations for convening this 
council would not have succeeded had its [draft] resolution 
highlighted both [Yemeni] unity and the need for all parties to 
commit themselves to it. 
  National unity in any Arab country means stability, 
impregnability, dignity, and the possibility of construction. 
Moreover, pan-Arab unity means a radical solution to the 
political, economic, social, and even demographic impasse now 
experienced by the Arab countries. It has never been an 
objective of the UN Security Council to achieve such noble Arab 
goals. 
  When addressing our national and pan-Arab issues, the UN 
Security Council used to stand alongside the parties opposed to 
the [Arab] nation and its future. Even when compelled to 
flatter us in some resolution, the Security Council used 
diplomatic language that meant nothing on the ground and was 
devoid of any applicable mechanisms. Successive Security Council 
resolutions on the Palestine question are the best examples of 
resolutions issued only to be entered in the archives. 
Meanwhile, resolutions serving the interests of the big powers 
are immediately implemented. 
  AL-ASWAQ adds: The formula used in Security Council 
Resolution [No. 924 on Yemen] will achieve only one objective, 
namely, to deepen the secession and fragmentation, perpetuate 
the [Yemeni] war, and expand its scope from Aden to Sanaa. As 
we do not rule out the presence of the desire and interest by 
one or more international party to perpetuate and expand the 
Yemeni war, we will continue to find it strange that some Arab 
positions advertently or inadvertently foster the continuation 
of war and encourage the secession. The fire raging in Yemen is 
close to every Arab house, although some people may think it 
will not expand.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The U.S. Ambassador and the Change of </F>
Government in North-West Frontier Province"] 
  [Text] According to a British magazine, John C. Monjo, the 
U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, has played an important role in the 
change of government in North-West Frontier Province [NWFP] and 
the appointment of Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao as chief minister. 
He also facilitated Sherpao's appointment by persuading Mir 
Afzal Khan and three other provincial assembly members to 
support Sherpao. The haste and bad taste displayed by the 
federal government in replacing the Muslim League government in 
NWFP and the maneuvers it adopted to tame Mir Afzal Khan 
indicate that something must have been wrong there. But no one 
could guess that the U.S. ambassador, who has long been like a 
viceroy in Pakistan, was also involved. 
  Reports kept circulating in the past that the U.S. 
Government 
and its ambassador played a very important role in the transfer 
of power in 1988. The country was suffering political 
instability then. It was suspected that (?messages) were being 
sought from Washington. Nevertheless, the U.S. interest was then 
believed to have been confined to major issues and federal 
government affairs only. The latest report, however, indicates 
that the provincial governments also are now at the mercy of the 
U.S. ambassador. A question may be asked about the way the U.S. 
ambassador established contacts with Mir Afzal Khan via Manzur 
Wattoo and convinced him to support Sherpao? How can we 
complain about the U.S. ambassador or any other person if our 
politicians are dependent on the advice of others on issues 
relating to national politics and the country's democracy, and 
are devoid of the capacity to decide themselves? 
  In view of the U.S. attempt to shape Afghan affairs 
according 
to its own perception, the government should clarify whether it 
wants to push the U.S. policy through the NWFP government or it 
intends to promote and protect national policies and interests. 
The federal government should also explain what price it has 
paid or will pay in the future for the political benefit it is 
accruing through the U.S. ambassador. The ambassador himself 
should also clarify whether he interfered in the affairs of 
NWFP, and if he did then in what capacity.

  [Text] A separate Kashmir Directorate has been set up in 
the Foreign Office to highlight the Kashmir issue worldwide. A 
spokesman of the Pakistan People's Party [PPP] said in Islamabad 
that the step has been taken on the prime minister's directive. 
He said the prime minister would like to expose the brutal 
atrocities carried out by Indian forces in occupied Kashmir, 
adding that she attaches significant importance to the Kashmir 
issue whenever she pays a visit abroad. The PPP spokesman said 
the government after careful consideration has formulated a 
strategy to secure international support for its just stand on 
Kashmir. He expressed the hope that its efforts will get a 
considerable boost as a result of Ms. Bhutto's upcoming visits 
to the United States and Russia.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "India's Aggressive Designs and our </F>
Responsibility"] 
  [Text] According to the report of a U.S. Senate committee, 
the Central Intelligence Agency is confident that hydrogen bombs 
are being manufactured in the Bhaba Atomic Research Center in 
Bombay. By conducting a nuclear test in 1974, India proved its 
nuclear capability. According to the deposition of former CIA 
chief William Casey, India's nuclear program has advanced to a 
dangerous level and India has enough enriched uranium to make 60 
to 80 atom bombs. For quite some time, international agencies 
have been giving hints about India's hydrogen bombs, and now the 
U.S. Senate report has endorsed them, thereby exposing India's 
designs. The other day, there was also a reference in the press 
about India's plans to manufacture Surya missiles. These will 
be of intercontinental ballistic missile type and have a 
capacity to hit a target up to 12,000 kms. Prior to this, India 
had also manufactured the medium-range Prithvi missile, whose 
final test preparations are nearing completion at Chandipur in 
Orissa. The other missiles manufactured by India include the 
Agni, Trishul, and Nag. India began a long-range missile 
program only to launch nuclear weapons, and it is surprising 
that the Cold War era has ended and the contemporary superpowers 
like Russia and the United States have also agreed to limit 
their missile programs. On the other side, even now, there is 
pressue from international monetary agencies to make 
considerable cuts in defense spending and give priority to the 
welfare of people rather than spending money on weapons. The 
irony is that India does not even care for international 
pressure. India did not even take the American message on the 
nuclear issue into consideration, which was acknowledged by 
President Clinton during his joint press conference with 
Narasimha Rao. It has made the acquisition of arms for all 
branches of its land, air, and naval forces a routine thing. 
India's blue water navy, which contains aircraft carriers and 
nuclear submarines, is 10 times larger than that of Pakistan. 
The Indian Air Force has sophisticated MiG-29 aircraft. In 
view of its size, the Indian Army is larger than those of all 
its small neighbors put together. In fact, India does not face 
any threat to its national security from any quarter. Until 
now, India took the lead in provoking its small and large 
neighbors. Pakistan became the target of Indian aggression 
three times in 1948, 1965, and 1971, and even now the target of 
all its preparations will only be Pakistan. India's aspirations 
and efforts are to accomplish the dream of Greater India and do 
away with the partition of mother India. Only Pakistan is an 
obstacle in the accomplishment of these despicable designs, and 
India can become a threat on our border at any time. India was 
constrained to reach an understanding with China. First, it is 
not possible for India to subdue China and second, it has 
realized that China does not have aggressive designs against any 
of its neighbors. Hence, the Indian forces, which were earlier 
deployed along the borders with China, have been moved and are 
now being deployed along the borders of Sindh, Punjab, and 
Kashmir. India has threatened several times that the continuing 
freedom movement in Kashmir can flare up into a "limited war". 
During his visit to the United States, President Leghari also 
spoke about the threat of a nuclear war. On the other side, the 
international powers have also identified the threat of a 
nuclear war in the subcontinent. It is definite that India may 
commit aggression in the future as it did in the past. To 
counter the situation, it is first the responsibility of 
Pakistan to not give up its policy of deterrence, and second, to 
make its defense impregnable. It is better to create political 
stability, as India will not have the guts to indulge in 
conflict. The global powers should also try to be aware of 
India's designs and not allow it to destroy peace in the region.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Nuclear Weapon, Indian Designs and the </F>
U.S. Strategy"] 
  [Text] The United States -- the world's sole superpower -- 
claims to be the greatest champion of nuclear nonproliferation. 
Assigning itself the role of world watchman, it has adopted a 
very strong policy to check nuclear proliferation in Korea, 
South Asia, and the Middle East. Reports, however, come in 
occasionally which make it easy for anyone to understand that 
the U.S. policy on the nuclear nonproliferation issue is to a 
great extent discriminatory and subservient to its own specific 
considerations. According to the latest report released in the 
United States, which was prepared in accordance with the 
instructions of the upper house of the Congress, the United 
States since 1988 gave permission for 1,500 export consignments 
which could be used for the manufacture of nuclear weapons. 
They included very complicated high-speed computers, lasers, 
furnaces, and machine parts. At least half of these 1,500 
export consignments were destined to companies and organizations 
which were involved with and working for the Israeli nuclear 
weapon program. During this period, 33 items were exported to 
India which could be used for the manufacture of nuclear 
weapons. All of these export items were sent to the Bhabha 
Atomic Research Center in Bombay where, according to the CIA, 
India is now engaged in producing a hydrogen bomb. The report 
says that a very limited quantity of exports also was made 
available to Brazil, Argentina, Iraq, South Africa, Iran, and 
Pakistan, but it was very negligible compared to what was 
supplied to Israel and India. Israel, in particular, was 
supplied 238 computers which were very useful in the manufacture 
of nuclear weapons. 
  It is not at all difficult to understand from this report 
that the U.S. policy of pressure on the nuclear weapons issue is 
not only unfair and inequitable, but also aimed at helping the 
countries of its choice with their nuclear programs. It is 
unfortunate that despite pursuing such a policy, the United 
States is claiming that it is treating all countries in a 
nondiscriminatory manner on the nuclear nonproliferation issue. 
With direct U.S. help, Israel has become so advanced in the 
manufacture of nuclear weapons and missiles that if, God forbid, 
a situation occurs when it is forced to display and use its 
weapons then the world will remained stunned to see the height 
of advancement Israel has achieved in the production of nuclear 
weapons. Similarly, India, with the U.S. help and with its own 
resources has developed its nuclear program, turning itself into 
a significant nuclear power. Also, it is fast accelerating its 
missile program. 
  India had temporarily halted its Prithvi missile test during 
Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's recent visit to the United 
States. Preparations, however, are under way now to resume the 
tests and Indian scientists have reached the test venue in 
Orissa. It has also been reported that these missiles will be 
deployed along Pakistan's border adjoining Indian Punjab and 
Rajasthan states. Later, they will be extended to the state of 
Jammu and Kashmir. 
  The United States is fully aware of India's nuclear program 
and its implications. During his recent visit to the United 
States, the Indian prime minister had made it clear that India 
was not ready to accept any U.S. suggestion about its nuclear 
program. The Indian stand now is that it is not ready to accept 
any restriction on its nuclear program even if Pakistan signs 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty unilaterally and India will 
accept a restriction only when a program to abolish the nuclear 
weapon is implemented on a global basis. It is not realistic 
if, after knowing the Indian stand, the United States still 
feels that it can succeed in checking nuclear proliferation. 
Given this situation, there is no justification for the United 
States to exert any pressure on Pakistan. 
  In view of the U.S. and Indian attitude, a school of thought 
in Pakistan is suggesting that we should also declare that we 
are not prepared to accept any restriction even if India accepts 
one on its nuclear program. If the U.S. and Indian attitude 
remains as it is now, then a time will come when it will not be 
possible to prevent this school of thought in Pakistan from 
becoming more powerful and popular. The U.S. Government now is 
realistic to the extent that it is not asking Pakistan to 
unilaterally roll back its nuclear program. Implementing the 
Pressler Amendment against us, however, is totally unjustified. 
In view of Indian designs and the policy of the United States 
itself, the United States has no justification for putting 
pressure on Pakistan. The whole nation supports the Government 
of Pakistan's stand that we will not accept any unilateral 
restriction on our nuclear program.

  [Text] The national economy has started showing signs of 
recovery because of the effective economic management by the 
present government. This was stated by the federal minister for 
information and broadcasting, Mr. Khalid Ahmad Khan Kharal, and 
the information secretary of Pakistan People's Party, Mr. Salman 
Taseer, in a joint news conference in Islamabad today. They 
said that the size of the stock exchange has been doubled during 
the last eight months by the infusion of $700 million by foreign 
investors, which shows the confidence of the international 
community in the macroeconomic stability of the country. 
  Mr. Khalid Ahmad Khan Kharal said the government has taken 
various measures to augment resources and reduce its expenditure 
considerably. He said the expenditure was curtailed by dropping 
uneconomical schemes, reducing size of the federal government 
expenditure, freezing of supplementary grants, and imposing 
discipline on provincial finances. He said revenues have 
registered an increase by 16.6 percent during July-March 1993-94 
over the corresponding period last year by plugging loopholes, 
launching successful recovery campaigns, and improving 
administrative capacity of the CDR's [expansion unknown]. He 
said the deficit financing has also been reduced to rupees 10.34 
billion against rupees 61.87 billion during the corresponding 
period last year. He said these measures have activated the 
economy and the positive results are visible in the key sectors 
and segment of the economy like GDP growth rate, balance of 
payments, and prices of essential commodities. The minister 
said in a short period the government has succeeded in bringing 
about macroeconomic stability in the financial and fiscal 
sectors and has also arrested declining trends in the domestic 
production. The government has also initiated programs of 
far-reaching improvements in the areas of energy, physical 
infrastructure, and social services so that the structural gap 
which has persisted for long in these sectors could be plugged.

  [Text] At a ceremony in Karachi, the country's indigenously 
built warship PNS [Pakistan Naval Ship] Larkana was inducted in 
the Pakistan Navy fleet today. Speaking on the occasion, the 
chief of the Naval Staff, Admiral Saeed M. Khan, said the 
building of PNS Larkana at Pakistan Navy Dockyard is a small 
beginning, but not an ordinary achievement. The warship has 
been designed and built by the engineers, architects, and 
workers of Pakistan Navy. Paying compliments to naval 
personnel, the naval chief said the induction of the homemade 
warship is a beginning of a long journey in raising a sound 
infrastructure of the Pakistan Navy. 
  The chief of Naval Dockyard explained the overall technical 
and professional capabilities of PNS Larkana. Later, the chief 
of the Naval Staff formally inducted the warship PNS Larkana in 
the Pakistan Navy. 
  The building of the patrol craft indigenously by Pakistan 
Navy is the first step toward self-reliance of designing and 
building of warships in the country. The ship has a speed of 24 
knots per hour with three mounted antiaircraft guns. The ship 
is also equipped with depth charge capabilities which could be 
used for antisubmarine operations.

bombarded two Ilyushin cargo planes which were unloading 
military cargoes at the separatists' al-Riyan airport in the 
Hadhramaut Governorate, eastern Yemen. 
  In statements broadcast in Sanaa last night, an authorized 
Yemeni source said that Yemeni aircraft blasted the two planes 
while in pursuit of separatist aircraft which were carrying out 
aggressive raids against citizens and vital and economic 
installations in the Ma'rib and Shabwah governorates. 
  The source said that the aircraft affiliated with the 
command 
of the Yemeni forces chased the separatists' planes to their 
landing positions at al-Riyan airport in the Hadramaut 
governorate, hitting many of them. 
  In a separate development, informed Yemeni sources said that 
the legitimate Yemeni forces yesterday took control of vital 
areas and inflicted big losses on fortifications inside Aden. 
  In statements to the Yemeni television last night, the 
sources revealed that the personnel of the Aden garrison--the 
Salah al-Din camp--have surrendered to the legitimate forces 
along with their weapons, including armored vehicles, artillery, 
and anti-aircraft guns. 
  Yemeni military sources did not mention the positions near 
Aden where the legitimate Yemeni forces are stationed.

  [Text] Sanaa, June 7 (AFP) -- Southern Yemeni warplanes 
flying from Aden airport attacked northern forces all along the 
front line around the southern port city from daybreak Tuesday 
[7 June], Yemeni Planning Minister 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani said. 
  The planes were attacking northern positions from Little 
Aden, just west of the main city, to Lahij to the north, 
"continuously bombarding the whole front," he said. 
  "This is a violation of the ceasefire," announced by the 
Sanaa authorities late Monday, al-Iryani said. 
  The ceasefire took effect midnight Monday (2100 GMT) but 
collapsed six hours later. 
  Al-Iryani said the Sanaa government would inform UN 
Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali about the southern air 
raids "immediately." 
  Asked whether the northern forces were firing back, 
al-Iryani 
said "I presume so." 
  A correspondent in Aden said northern artillery was pounding 
the airport and surrounding area for the third straight day in 
an attempt to prevent it being used as a base for the warplanes.

  [Text] Sanaa, June 7 (AFP) -- Southern Yemeni warplanes 
have attacked northern oil installations for the first time 
since the civil war began a month ago, Western oil industry 
sources in Sanaa said Tuesday [7 June]. 
  The southerners had vowed to retaliate after Aden's oil 
refinery was bombed on Sunday and storage tanks set ablaze. 
  A Western oil official said that two planes dropped bombs 
near one of the facilities in the Ma'rib oil field in north 
eastern Yemen early Monday but there was no damage. 
  The official news agency SABA' said the attack by southern 
warplanes was "unsuccessful" and that the jets were driven off 
by northern jets. 
  The oil company Yemen Hunt Oil, a local subsidiary of the 
Dallas-based Hunt Oil, is still operating in the Ma'rib field 
neighboring the Shabwah region. 
  The Ma'rib zone produces 320,000 bpd, nearly all of Yemen's 
output.

  [Text] A top Yemeni official has said that southern 
warplanes bombarded government forces this morning, violating an 
hours' old unilateral cease-fire aimed at ending Yemen's civil 
war. 
  Planning Minister 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani told the press 
that 
Aden aircraft were bombarding all around since 6 AM this 
morning. Mr. al-Iryani declined to say whether the reported 
bombardment meant the government would now consider the 
open-ended cease-fire invalidated. He also declined to comment 
on reports from Aden that gunfire was heard coming from outside 
the city as early as 3 AM. All he said was that when jets fly 
over troops, they will have to fire back. 
  The cease-fire declared by the Yemeni Government in coping 
with last week's UN Security Council resolution on Yemen went 
into effect at midnight last night. In announcing the 
unilateral cease-fire last night, the Yemeni Foreign Minister 
Muhammad Salim Basindwah warned that tacit support for the 
separatists could reignite the fighting.

  [Text] While our brave Armed Forces -- the forces of unity 
and legitimacy -- have fully complied with the declaration of 
cease-fire on all axes as of 2400 yesterday [6 June], in 
implementation of Security Council Resolution 924, the 
rebellious separatist gang, led by the [Yemeni] Socialist Party 
[YSP], violated the cease-fire resolution and continued its 
aggression against our Armed Forces. The aircraft affiliated 
with this criminal gang this morning carried out aggressive 
raids against our Armed Forces positions on all axes. 
  The source warned against this violation of the cease-fire 
by 
the rebellious separatist gang, which constitutes blatant 
defiance of the international will and reflects the adventurous 
aggressive behavior of this separatist rebellious gang.

storage tanks in the Aden oil refinery in south Yemen. 
  In a statement made today, the Yemeni ambassador said such

that since the outbreak of war, Sanaa has been eager to keep all 
vital and civilian installations in the southern governorates 
away from military operations.

<F P=106> [Report by Ahmad Birru from Sanaa] </F>
  [Excerpt] Yemen has informed the UN secretary general and 
the Arab League secretary general that it has decided to observe 
a cease-fire as of midnight tonight. This was announced by 
Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Basindwah who also said that 
the statement issued by the foreign ministers of the Gulf 
Cooperation Council [GCC] countries in Abha yesterday was not 
cordial toward his country, and does not help in implementing 
the UN Security Council resolution. After criticizing any 
outside interference in Yemeni affairs, Basindwah said he hopes 
that the neighboring countries will review their stands as it is 
in these countries' interest to be on the side of legitimacy, or 
at least to adopt a stand of neutrality. He said that the Gulf 
stand will encourage the southerners not to respect the 
international resolution. 
  In reply to a question on a possible Saudi military 
intervention in Yemen, Basindwah said he believes that it will 
not reach the extent of military interference. He added that he 
has summoned the GCC ambassadors to inform them about Yemen's 
indignation at the Abha statement. 
  As for what Sanaa will do if the proclaimed Democratic 
Republic of Yemen [DRY] wins recognition, Basindwah said that 
Yemeni unity was attained by the Yemeni people, and recognition 
will not change anything with respect to the existence of a 
legitimate Yemeni state. 
  Basindwah said that the Yemeni officials held no contacts 
with any Gulf country since the decision [proclaiming the 
establishment of the DRY] was issued. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Foreign Ministry summoned at noon today the 
ambassadors of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Sultanate of 
Oman, and the United Arab Emirates, as well as the Kuwaiti 
charge d'affaires, and handed them memorandums protesting the 
content of the final statement issued at the end of the 51st 
session of the Ministerial Council of the Gulf Cooperation 
Council [GCC] on the Republic of Yemen. 
  The memorandums say that the Government of the Republic of 
Yemen views the statement as interference in our country's 
domestic affairs and as hostility to Yemen's unity, which was 
established peacefully and by the free will of the people 
throughout the Yemeni homeland on 22 May 1990, as reflected by 
the general popular referendum on the Yemeni Constitution on 16 
May 1991 and as reinforced by the free and fair parliamentary 
elections on 27 April 1993. Therefore, no person or persons can 
be allowed to impose any form of division, fragmentation, or 
cutting off of any part of the country to establish a state on 
it whenever a declaration or a decision conflicting with the 
Constitution and the law is issued. 
  These memorandums point to our government's regret about 
these positions and statements by fraternal and neighboring 
states, which contributed to the adoption of Security Council 
Resolution No. 924, and state that such positions and statements 
will hamper the implementation of the resolution. Copies of 
these memorandums were sent to the Arab League secretary general 
and the UN secretary general. 
  An official source has stated that this position taken by 
five GCC member states will encourage the remnants that have 
rebelled against the constitutional legitimacy to refuse to 
comply with the cease-fire resolution.

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council, today met with the brother 
leaders of the political parties and organizations in the 
national arena. 
  They discussed many issues about the Yemeni homeland and 
safeguarding its unity. They also considered developments in 
the national arena in light of the war ignited in the homeland 
by both the secessionist gang and the rebellion and in view of 
the declaration of secession made by the traitor and agent 
al-Bid, and also in light of issuing UN Security Council 
Resolution 924 on the situation in Yemen, and in view of the 
final statement issued by the meetings of the foreign ministers 
of the Gulf Cooperation Council on the situation in our country, 
in addition to the speech delivered by Saudi Foreign Minister 
Sa'ud al-Faysal on Yemen. 
  The brother chairman indicated the importance of this 
meeting 
which groups the political parties and organizations in the 
national arena, so they can responsibly rise to national duty in 
terms of confronting the schemes hostile to unity. He said: We 
are meeting under the extremely important and crucial 
circumstances through which the Yemeni homeland is passing. 
This homeland is now experiencing severe regrettable events 
fabricated by the rebellious secessionists in order to involve 
the homeland's sons in fighting and implement their secessionist 
scheme. 
  The brother chairman reviewed the scenario and aspects of 
the 
destructive secessionist plan that have brought the homeland to 
the point it is at. He also pointed to the fact that this gang 
stockpiled weapons, vehicles, and military hardware, fabricated 
crises in the homeland, and ultimately exploded the situation 
militarily and caused fighting between the homeland's sons and 
their Armed Forces in Abyan and later in Harf Sufyan, Shabwah, 
'Imran, Dhamar, and Aden in addition to this gang's suspect 
moves abroad in order to evoke others' hostility to both Yemen 
and its unity. 
  The brother chairman asserted that this criminal 
secessionist 
gang in the [Yemeni] Socialist Party [YSP] leadership plotted 
against the YSP itself and against unity. He explained the 
concessions and sacrifices offered to prevent this gang from 
implementing its conspiracy against the homeland and unity. 
This gang either sought to unilaterally rule Yemen or fragment 
the homeland and reinstate the partition to achieve its own 
narrow interests, he added. 
  The brother chairman said: We sought dialogue and its 
continuation in order to keep the homeland away from war. This 
gang, however, continued to implement its criminal scheme by 
igniting war and imposing it on the homeland in order to shatter 
unity. We were thus forced into defending the homeland and 
confronting the scheme designed to fragment it. 
  The brother president explained that the Yemeni unity was 
realized through peaceful and democratic means, and was not 
imposed by force. He said this unity is an expression of the 
free will of the Yemeni people, demonstrated in the referendum 
on the Republic of Yemen's Constitution and the elections of 27 
April 1993, and the setting up of constitutional establishments. 
The Yemeni people have always been one people who stick to 
their unity, and they will not relinquish it because they are 
aware of the consequences of separation, and they have paid a 
high price during past divisive conflicts. 
  He added that the secessionist and rebellious gang dreamt of 
restoring its dictatorial and totalitarian rule. It does not 
accept democracy or participation with others, and it does 
tolerate different opinions. Therefore, it sought to circumvent 
democracy and the results of the legitimate and constitutional 
elections. 
  The brother Presidential Council chairman emphasized that 
the 
Republic of Yemen's policy is that of democracy and political 
pluralism, freedom of the press, respect of human rights, and 
building of modern civilian establishments, free economy, and 
social justice. 
  He said this policy will not be relinquished, and will 
continue to be the choice to which we will adhere to embody the 
aspirations for building a new Yemen, the pillars of which we 
laid down on 22 May 1990, and there will never be a return to 
the totalitarian separatist system. 
  The brother Presidential Council chairman urged leaders of 
parties and political organizations to close national ranks, and 
form a broad national front in which efforts are mobilized to 
confront the challenges imposed on the homeland, its unity, and 
sovereignty. 
  He said building and protecting the homeland is everyones 
responsibility, and that we should unite and rise above all 
differences and sensitivities of the past in order to keep the 
dangers away from the homeland and safeguard its unity, and 
support all nationalist constants. 
  The brother president expressed appreciation for the 
nationalist and responsible position of the political parties 
and organizations, unions, popular organizations, and all 
political and social figures in the national arena for 
confronting the secessionist plan and their rejection of 
al-Bid's separatist proclamation, and their support in face of 
the elements and perpetrators of this plan. 
  He said the challenge the Yemeni homeland faces at present 
is 
the real test of all the homeland's sons, led by political 
parties and organizations, in order to prove the credibility of 
positions and commitment to national responsibility. 
  The brother president hailed the heroic performance of our 
valiant Armed Forces, the forces of unity and legitimacy, which 
respond to the people's will with high nationalist determination 
to defend unity and democracy, and safeguard the constitutional 
legitimacy, security, and stability in the homeland.

<F P=106> [Statement by "a responsible source" at the Foreign Ministry </F>
of the State of Qatar] 
  [Text] The State of Qatar has voiced support for the 
Security Council Resolution No. 924 on the situation in the 
Yemeni Republic and its constant position on the need to end the 
fighting between the Yemeni brothers and resort to dialogue to 
solve the problem. The State of Qatar, however, has voiced 
reservations over two paragraphs of the statement issued 
yesterday, 5 June 1994, at the end of the session of the 
Ministerial Council of the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] on the 
situation in Yemen, because these two paragraphs do not refer to 
the legitimate name of the fraternal country, the Yemeni 
Republic, as mentioned in the Security Council resolution. In 
addition, the two paragraphs do not note the importance of 
preserving Yemen's unity that was set up by consent and public 
referendum.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Yemeni Peace and Solidarity </F>
Council; place and date not given] 
  [Text] The Yemeni Peace and Solidarity Council is following 
with a great deal of dissatisfaction the rebellious gang's 
inhuman conduct toward fraternal Arabs who came to the Republic 
of Yemen in accordance with job contracts signed with official 
agencies in the educational, health, and other fields. This 
gang is arresting and torturing these nationals, and forcing 
them to make false confessions that they are engaged in alleged 
military actions. They are being portrayed as prisoners of war 
captured in the battlefield. 
  These criminal acts are manifestations of cheap blackmail. 
Similarly, they are lowly attempts to delude the world into 
believing that the countries of these innocent victims are 
involved in the Yemeni crisis. These cheap acts, and similar 
other criminal and inhuman acts, such as using the elderly, 
women, and children as human shields; dropping booby-trapped 
pens, toys, and sweets to kill innocent children; and using 
banned missiles of mass destruction run counter to all universal 
conventions. Likewise, they violate the Geneva conventions and 
their two supplementary protocols. 
  While denouncing these criminal acts, the Yemeni Peace and 
Solidarity Council urges all international organizations, and 
the International Committee of the Red Cross to condemn these 
violations of human values and principles, and international 
norms and conventions, as well. It also urges them to vindicate 
the Yemeni people and support them against the enemies of their 
unity, constitutional legitimacy, and democratic experiment.

  [Excerpts] The Presidential Council of the Democratic 
Republic of Yemen has issued a call to the sons of the Yemeni 
people, in which it pointed out that there was irrefutable 
evidence that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih is the one who is issuing 
orders to his forces to carry out barbarous acts in peaceful 
towns and villages. [passage omitted] 
  The call confirmed that Aden and every inch of the territory 
of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, which he imagined in his 
sick dreams he would control, were beyond him. The call said 
that it was time to get rid of this bloody regime, whose hands 
had been smeared by blood since he took control of the northern 
governorates. It appealed to the sons of our Yemeni people to 
assume their patriotic duties to destroy this malignant microbe, 
which had corrupted many aspects of life in all parts of the 
coutnry. 
  The call confirmed that the Sanaa regime was approaching its 
end and was facing its last hours. It called on citizens to cut 
off supplies to its forces, because they had become tired and 
exhausted, and because the regime had failed to achieve its 
promises to them that they would be in Aden within two days.

  [Text] The south Yemeni leaders this evening welcomed 
Sanaa's announcement of a cease-fire. 'Abdallah al-Asnaj, 
foreign minister of the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY] 
government that was formed in southern Yemen, said in a 
telephone interview we held with him this evening from Cairo 
that Aden will deal positively with the cease-fire decision. 
  [Begin recording] [Al-Asnaj] The DRY -- government, people, 
and presidency -- repeats its concern for halting the fighting 
in Yemen. It is only natural that we should welcome Sanaa's 
decision on the cease-fire, which will begin at midnight 
tonight. We hope that this decision will not be violated. On 
our part, we have released an official statement saying that the 
DRY welcomes this decision and will comply with the time 
proposed. 
  [Correspondent] Is the cease-fire decision linked to Sanaa's 
statement that it has tightened its control around Aden? 
  [Al-Asnaj] There is nothing to justify saying that control 
of 
Aden was, is, or will be tightened, God willing. Aden and the 
other governorates in the DRY and the nature of Yemen's sons 
will not surrender to invasion or occupation. Aden has 
well-known experience in rejecting and repulsing occupation.

934, which stipulates an immediate cease-fire in Yemen. 
  In an exclusive statement to MENA, al-Asnaj called for 
isolating these officials regionally and internationally. He 
said: Giving them the feeling that there will be a decision to 
isolate them will make them accept the cease-fire 
unconditionally.

been appointed deputy prime minister and foreign minister in the 
Aden government has reiterated his country's commitment to 
implementing Security Council Resolution 924 on the crisis in 
Yemen. 
  In statements to Voice of the Arabs Radio today, he welcomed 
Sanaa's declaration of a cease-fire on all combat lines, noting 
the importance of a serious and actual commitment to the new 
date. He called for sending international observers to ensure 
that the cease- fire is not breached. 
  Al-Asnaj's statements are the first southern reaction to 
Sanaa's unilateral decision to cease fire as of midnight (?last

  [Text] Cairo, 7 Jun (MENA) -- Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr 
al-'Attas, recently appointed head of the government in Aden, 
said that Sanaa has not abided by the cease-fire decision and 
continued its attack on Aden this morning, indiscriminately 
bombarding the southern residential areas. 
  At a news conference held in Cairo at noon today, al-'Attas 
played a recording of a message by Yemeni President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih intercepted by the military command in Aden. In 
his message, President Salih instructed northern forces to 
advance toward the south, continue fighting, and disregard the 
UN Security Council cease-fire resolution, claiming that the 
Yemeni war is an internal issue. 
  Al-'Attas said that the people in Aden have joined the army 
to check northern aggression. He stressed that the north cannot 
settle military operations in its favor for several reasons, 
including the geographical vastness of south Yemen. 
  In his news conference, Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas said while 
Aden announced its readiness to receive the fact-finding mission 
and to facilitate its task for the sake of establishing peace in 
Yemen and resorting to dialogue in lieu of war and fighting, 
Sanaa refused to heed the UN Security Council resolution and the 
advice of the Arab leaders led by President Husni Mubarak, 
United Arab Emirates [UAE] President Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan al 
Nuhayyan, Saudi King Fahd Bin- 'Abd-al-'Aziz, and Syrian 
President Hafiz al-Asad. 
  Al-'Attas continued by saying that Sanaa has repeatedly 
declared its conditional acceptance of a cease-fire, but it has 
revoked this acceptance, using false excuses. These 
contradictory stands are adopted by Sanaa's various military, 
tribal, and extremist religious elements, al-'Attas added. 
  Al-'Attas pointed out that the military situation in Yemen 
has witnessed a serious flare up over the past 48 hours when 
Sanaa used all its destructive weapons, including missiles and 
long-range heavy artillery. He noted that residential areas and 
utilities have become targets of missiles, warplanes, and 
artillery. 
  He said that the bombardment and burning of the Aden 
refinery 
is the biggest crime yet, and has shaken the Arab and 
international world. He said that the population of al-Dali', 
Radfan, Lahij, al-Hiswah, al-Burayqah, al-Waht, Aden, and 
Khormaksar had to flee their homes lest they be used as human 
shields by what he calls the northern invading soldiers. 
  Abu-Bakr al-'Attas went on to say in his news conference 
that 
the northern soldiers have been misguided by the extremist 
Islamic groups led by those who claim to be religious such as 
'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani, 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Uns, and 
'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Dulaymi. He said that these men, who are also 
teachers of the jurisprudence in Islam, issued a fatwa in the 
name of 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Dulaymi, a member of the Yemeni Reform 
Grouping which is a partner in the government coalition. The 
fatwa notes that the cease-fire is taboo, the killing of the 
inhabitants of Aden and the south, who are defending their 
rights, is permissible, and that the southern areas are 
considered booty. 
  Al-'Attas added that the world has witnessed the extent of 
the damage to coffee plantations in al-Dali' and Radfan and the 
wiping out of entire villages in the districts of Subayhi, 
Lahij, Shabwah, Abyan, and the outskirts of al-Hutah and Aden. 
He said that residential areas in Zinjibar, al-Hutah, 
Khormaksar, and Dar al-Amir have become "ghost towns." 
  He explained that the wounded are filling the hospitals and 
that Arab and foreign journalists have relayed images of the 
unprecedented crimes perpetrated against the south. He said he 
reviewed the details of this military escalation and what he 
described as "a war of extermination and total destruction" 
during his meetings with President Husni Mubarak, UAE President 
Shaykh Zayid Sultan, Saudi and Kuwaiti officials, and the Arab 
League secretary general. 
  Al-'Attas pointed out that Sanaa persistently refuses all 
appeals to stop the war, and is dropping missiles on the heads 
of the citizens in various southern areas, and ruining the 
national economy under the pretext of maintaining the country's 
unity. He added that Sanaa is trying to maintain unity over 
lakes of blood and piles of corpses of innocent citizens of the 
Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY] who are holding steadfast 
against the aggression. 
  Regarding the prospect of international recognition of the 
DRY, al-'Attas said that this is not the crucial issue now, the 
important thing is to end hostilities and to stop the bloodshed 
prior to negotiations with the northern leaders over an agenda. 
  Al-'Attas remarked that the Yemeni union was slaughtered by 
the current fighting. He pointed out that the Yemeni people, 
despite all this, still believe in the cause of unity but in 
another form that is based on mutual understanding and dialogue, 
not on guns and bullets. 
  He said that the people in south Yemen are open-minded and 
willing to discuss matters and many issues can be negotiated 
after the fighting stops. 
  Al-'Attas welcomed the dispatch of a UN observer force as a 
first step toward attaining peace and stability in the country. 
  He repeated his accusations that Iraq and Sudan are sending 
supplies and reinforcements to the northern forces. 
  Al-'Attas' news conference was attended by 'Abdallah 
al-Asnaj, recently appointed DRY deputy prime minister and 
foreign minister; Planning Minister Muhsin Muhammad Bin-Farid; 
and Transport and Communications Minister Salih 'Ubayd Ahmad.

  [Text] The Peres letter on Jerusalem has angered political 
leaders on the right of the Israeli spectrum and raised 
questions in East Jerusalem. Details from Steven Pantanowitz: 
  [Begin recording] [Pantanowitz] There have been reactions 
from leading members of the Likud and other parties further to 
the right in the Israeli political arena. Likud Knesset Member 
[MK] Beni Begin, who for some time has been charging that such a 
letter exists, issued a statement saying that publication proved 
the government was trying to lead the nation astray. He said 
only a few hours before it was put out, government spokesmen 
were claiming that it was merely a copy of the foreign 
minister's Knesset speech in September. This is not true, Begin 
said. He charged that the Israeli Government, with the 
agreement of the prime minister, had given the PLO a commitment 
under which the status of its institutions in Jerusalem would be 
preserved without any time limit whatsoever. In so doing, Begin 
said, the government had struck a substantive blow at Israeli 
sovereignty in Jerusalem, and he forecast the publication of 
more documents in this vein. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0400 GMT on 7 June adds 
that "the Tzomet Knesset faction joins the Likud demand to have 
a revote on the Cairo agreements following the disclosure of 
Peres' letter. MK Moshe Peled told our correspondent Hayim 
Hecht that Tzomet is demanding that the government make public 
two other annexes to the Cairo agreement dealing with Yasir 
'Arafat's status."] 
  The National Religious Party spoke of double moral standards 
and a cover-up. Israel, the statement said, was abandoning its 
basic positions of principles, and the government was falling 
into a trap laid by 'Arafat on the way to turning Jerusalem into 
the capital of Palestine. 
  MK Rehav'am Ze'evi, the leader of the small Moledet faction, 
talked of an Israeli Government participating in another march 
of folly, as he put it. 
  In defense of the letter, Shulamit Aloni, leader of the 
left-wing Meretz coalition party, criticized the lack of 
forthrightness in the affair and said it was better to tell the 
truth and not to hide one's convictions. 
  Police Minister Moshe Shahal met last night with Faysal 
al-Husayni and told him that Israel had no intention of changing 
the status quo that existed in Jerusalem before the Oslo 
conference. The two met after Faysal al-Husayni held an urgent 
meeting of the Arab Committee on Jerusalem. Hanan 'Ashrawi, a 
member of the committee, on the controversial Peres letter: 
  ['Ashrawi] Very clearly, the Israeli officials knew about 
it, and they still persisted in a policy of undermining 
Palestinian presence and Palestinian rights. So there is, in a 
sense, a violation of trust. And because the letter was 
supposed to be kept secret until both sides agreed -- or not to 
be disclosed -- then it means that they used this lack of 
disclosure in order to create facts which are prejudicial to 
Palestinian institutions. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Police Minister Moshe Shahal met last night in 
Jerusalem with Faysal al-Husayni on the issue of Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres' letter and made it clear to him that 
Israel has no plans to hurt the Palestinian institutions that 
began operating in East Jerusalem after the Madrid conference. 
Our correspondent Moti Amir reports: 
  [Begin Amir recording] The police minister held an urgent 
and secret meeting with al-Husayni because of the need to 
publicize Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres' letter to his 
Norwegian counterpart. Palestinian sources reported that 
Minister Shahal reiterated to al-Husayni that Israel has no 
intention of impeding the activities of the Palestinian 
institutions established in East Jerusalem after the Madrid 
conference and that there will be no change in the status quo on 
the issue. According to them, al-Husayni voiced his concern 
over statements by Israeli cabinet ministers regarding the 
activities in Orient House and once again demanded that the 
Israeli Government lift the closure on East Jerusalem, which 
cuts it off from the territories. 
  Al-Husayni came to the meeting with Shahal after an 
emergency 
session at his office in Orient House with members of the 
Jerusalem Committee. His fellow committee members accused 
Israel of trying to determine unilaterally and already at this 
point the status and future of Jerusalem. [passage omitted] 
  It should be pointed out that the Jerusalem Committee headed 
by al-Husayni set up a subcommittee to monitor Israel's actions 
against the Palestinian institutions in East Jerusalem. 
  [Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew on 7 June, in a page-9 
report by Roni Shaqed, says that "yesterday, Arab leaders in 
Jerusalem decided to take action to strengthen the Palestinians' 
status in the city and raise the plight of the city within all 
negotiating frameworks without conceding its status as the 
Palestinian capital. It was also decided to continue to develop 
the Palestinian institutions in Jerusalem and not to heed 
Israel's orders to transfer these institutions to the autonomy 
area." 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0600 GMT on 7 June adds 
that Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi told correspondent Moti Amir last night 
that "all the Palestinian autonomy institutions will be located 
in Gaza and Jericho during the interim period but could relocate 
elsewhere, including East Jerusalem, later."]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Police Minister Moshe Shahal by </F>
Hayim Zissowitz; place not given -- live] 
  [Text] [Zissowitz] Good morning, Police Minister Moshe 
Shahal. 
  [Shahal] Good morning, Hayim. 
  [Zissowitz] I suppose you are calling us to react to what 
the foreign minister said. 
  [Shahal] I am also prepared to talk about that, but first I 
would like to discuss something else. It is a real shame that 
you did not talk to me about the report on my meeting with 
Faysal al-Husayni, because it is entirely untrue. 
  First, I did not meet with Faysal al-Husayni because of the 
foreign minister's letter. The truth is that I only learned 
about the existence of a letter to the Norwegian foreign 
minister yesterday evening. 
  Second, this was not an emergency meeting. 
  Third, what was discussed in it was the exact opposite of 
what you reported. I unequivocally told Faysal al-Husayni that 
if any Palestinian security or police personnel are deployed in 
Orient House or elsewhere [in East Jerusalem], we will arrest 
them, take them into police custody, and bring them to trial; 
that if we find a man bearing arms in Jerusalem without a 
license or permit, he will be thrown in jail; that if we discern 
any pan-Palestinian activities in Orient House, we will simply 
take legal action against it. I cited the example of the 
Palestinian Bureau of Statistics and categorically told him that 
we will shut it down. I told him in the most unambiguous manner 
that Jerusalem is unequivocally the capital of Israel; that the 
status quo will not change as far as Jerusalem is concerned; 
that it is totally inconceivable to us to allow any change 
whatsoever, either creeping or otherwise, that would alter the 
status of Jerusalem during the interim period. This was a very 
comprehensive meeting, and it was attended by Mr. Moshe Sason 
and the Jerusalem District police commander. That is why I am 
very sorry that you aired this report without asking me. 
  [Zissowitz] Well, so you have now clarified what was said in 
the meeting. Since you called us, I would like to seize this 
opportunity to ask you: Do you feel embarrassed this morning 
after learning that you were sent to the Knesset to declare from 
the podium that no letter was sent to Yasir 'Arafat and that the 
whole thing was the figment of someone's imagination? 
  [Shahal] First of all, I am not embarrassed when facts are 
revealed. After asking the Prime Minister's Office for 
details, I went to the Knesset podium and gave an answer in 
accordance with what I had been told in the clearest and most 
categorical fashion. I did not know about the existence of a 
letter to the Norwegian foreign minister, but after I talked to 
Foreign Minister Peres yesterday.... 
  [Zissowitz, interrupting] Were you misled? 
  [Shahal] I would not say that. I do not think anybody had 
such intentions. After talking to the foreign minister 
yesterday and asking him for explanations, and after he read the 
letter to me, I must note another point that was not 
sufficiently stressed, which is that the letter to Holst speaks 
about institutions for the residents of East Jerusalem. 
Nevertheless, I did not know about the existence of such a 
letter. 
  [Zissowitz] Thank you very much, Minister Shahal.

<F P=106> [Studio discussion by political correspondent Gadi Sukenik </F>
and announcer Ya'aqov Ahime'ir on the "Popolitika" program; 
monitored in progress -- live] 
  [Text] [Sukenik]...I have 
the letter Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres wrote to the late 
Norwegian Foreign Minister Johan Jorgen Holst. Permission to 
make the letter public was given by his successor. The Foreign 
Ministry said Israel firmly insisted that the Palestinian 
autonomy institutions be situated in Jericho and not in 
Jerusalem, but made it clear that there would not be any change 
in the status of the Palestinian inhabitants. Foreign Minister 
Peres acted with the knowledge of the prime minister, and that 
is very important for relations between the two and for 
responsibility, for at least the information fiasco. The letter 
says: I wish to confirm that the Palestinian institutions in 
East Jerusalem and the affairs and welfare of the Palestinians 
in East Jerusalem are very important, and will be upheld. 
Therefore, all the Palestinian institutions in East Jerusalem 
-- economic, social, educational, and cultural -- and the 
Christian and Muslim holy places fulfill a vital function for 
the Palestinian population. There is no need to say we will not 
intervene with their activities. Yours sincerely, Shim'on Peres. 
  That is the letter. It is still not clear whether that is 
all there is. I must say that several days ago.... 
  [Ahime'ir, interrupting] But we just saw the letter, and you 
read out the translation. What do you mean when you say it is 
not clear if that is all there is? Is that the letter or not? 
  [Sukenik] That is the letter. The question is whether there 
is more, why Israel admitted to a letter only three weeks after 
'Arafat divulged the fact that he has a letter on Jerusalem, no 
matter how innocent it is. Shim'on Peres and others -- 
including Rabin in the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense 
Committee several days after the letter's existence became known 
-- said that there are no secret annexes to the accord with the 
Palestinians. In other words, they say this is not an annex to 
the accord, but a knowledgeable Foreign Ministry source told me 
that it is an accompanying letter -- to what? Not to my 
mortgage--apparently to the agreements with the Palestinians. 
  [Ahime'ir] Gadi, do you suspect there might be other 
documents? 
  [Sukenik] I do fear that because of the fact that it was 
held up for weeks and the fact that we were told it contains 
only a quote from Peres' Knesset speech. By the way, there is 
another letter translated into Hebrew -- I will not show it to 
the camera now -- which contains quotes from Peres' speech to 
the Knesset, but Faysal al-Husayni spoke about other 
understandings on Jerusalem made in February, and in the wake of 
this whole circus, it is not clear if that is all there is. 
There is no doubt that in the best circumstances, Rabin and 
Peres have lost a lot of points in their battle for credibility. 
We are going to have a national referendum, at least on the 
Golan Heights, and this creates a big problem.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Nahum Barne'a: "Caught With Their Pants </F>
Down"] 
  [Text] Whether it was an act of unlucky bungling or malice, 
negligence, or deliberately pulling the wool over our eyes -- 
whatever the reasons, it is hard to deny one thing: Our 
government was caught with its pants down. 
  Peres sent a letter and Rabin sent Shahal to the Knesset 
podium to deny it. It is an embarrassing event, perhaps the 
most embarrassing since this government was founded. The 
biggest scandal is not the contents of the letter but the 
attempt to deny its existence. Up to now, we have known that 
one party to the Oslo agreement -- Yasir 'Arafat -- has a 
credibility problem. Now we are starting to understand that the 
other side has a problem, too. 
  The letter was sent after tough wrangling between Israel and 
the PLO. 'Arafat demanded the personal status of patron of the 
Christian and Muslim holy sites, as well as a permanent 
political entity in East Jerusalem. Israel wanted to totally 
circumvent the Jerusalem issue. 
  In the end, if our government sources yesterday told the 
whole truth, 'Arafat gave up including the Jerusalem issue in 
the agreement and its annexes. Israel, for its part, agreed to 
send Norwegian Foreign Minister Johan Jorgen Holst a letter 
summing up Palestinian rights in East Jerusalem. The letter has 
an annex containing sections on Jerusalem from Peres' speech to 
the Knesset -- that is, if they are telling the whole truth. 
  The letter undertakes to uphold and respect all the 
Palestinian institutions in the eastern part of the city: They 
are performing an essential task. Israel will not hamper their 
activity; on the contrary, it will encourage them. The same 
holds true for the Muslim and Christian holy sites. 
  This implies the beginning of recognition of 'Arafat's 
preeminent status over Christian and Muslim assets in East 
Jerusalem -- not Saudi Arabia's, not Jordan's, not even an 
international body's, but the PLO's. It, of course, involves 
recognition of the activity of the PLO institutions in 
Jerusalem. 'Arafat was inaccurate when he said in his 
Johannesburg speech that the undertaking was given to him in 
Cairo, but he did not lie when he said that he had received a 
commitment. 
  Dan Meridor suspected that there was some truth to 'Arafat's 
remarks. He should be praised for his investigation. Twice, 
Moshe Shahal got up in the name of the government to clarify 
'Arafat's remarks, and twice he said there was no letter. 
Shahal received his information from Eytan Haber, head of the 
prime minister's bureau. Shim'on Peres was on a tour of North 
and Latin America at the time. He did not know whether the 
government was telling the truth. 
  Last week, Rabin addressed the Knesset Foreign Affairs and 
Defense Committee. Meridor called on Beni Begin to question the 
prime minister. Begin exerted pressure; Rabin wriggled out of 
by answering: "To the best of my knowledge, there is no letter 
to 'Arafat." It was a semiadmission. 
  It is true that the letter was not addressed to 'Arafat but 
to Holst. It is true that the Rabin government did not hurt the 
status quo in Jerusalem. It was the Shamir government that 
approved the activities of the PLO institutions in Jerusalem, 
under the direction of Orient House. It made a grave mistake, 
from its point of view. In fact, Peres wrote to Holst what 
Shamir had authorized for al-Husayni. 
  That does not significantly change the fact that Rabin and 
Peres were caught with their pants down. For days, they have 
been humoring us with the story that the Peres letter is merely 
a reiteration of the position he expressed in the Knesset debate 
on the Oslo agreement. I read the speech and the letter. In 
the speech, Peres said that "each community in Jerusalem can 
uphold its cultural tradition, its special character, its 
social, religious, and other institutions." He barely deserves 
a passing grade for the resemblance between the two versions. 
  For months we were told that 'Arafat represents a different 
culture, a different mentality. We are responsible for every 
word we utter; he lies through his teeth. The letter incident 
has somewhat blurred the differences. This may be the new 
Middle East Peres has been talking about so much.

  [Text] Former U.S. Defense Secretary Les Aspin says the 
U.S. Administration understands that an Israeli-Syrian peace 
settlement would require extensive resources, which it is 
willing to commit. He was speaking during a lecture at the 
Davies Institute of Hebrew University in Jerusalem. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin, who also spoke at the 
gathering, cited an article from the London-based paper 
AL-HAYAH, which is considered a reliable source on Syria. The 
newspaper's editor wrote that peace talks between Israel and 
Syria are not frozen. He recalled that former U.S. Secretary of 
State Henry Kissinger shuttled between Jerusalem and Damascus 41 
times to help arrange the separation of forces agreement after 
the Yom Kippur War. Israel and Syria have shared outlooks, 
Beilin said: a desire for a peace agreement; recognition of the 
need for withdrawal and U.S. involvement in the process.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said that Mustafa 
al-Dirani's abduction has uncovered information about missing 
navigator Ron Arad; however, there are still no clear details 
regarding his fate. The prime minister spoke with 
correspondents yesterday at Haifa University, where he received 
an honorary doctorate. Haviva Roger reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Roger] Until it is proven otherwise, 
Yitzhaq Rabin asserted, I consider Ron Arad to be alive. 
Al-Dirani's abduction to Israel added information about Ron 
Arad. 
  [Rabin] He is talking, but I will not say what he is saying. 
There is additional information about the past, and I hope that 
the same may perhaps also be true with regard to the future. At 
this stage, one must be cautious and not make unnecessary 
statements. Since I cannot state with certainty that Ron Arad is 
no longer alive, his status is that of a POW or MIA. Until 
proven otherwise, I consider him alive. 
  [Roger] The prime minister expressed the assessment that 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will arrive by the 
end of the month for another round of talks between Syria and 
Israel. Rabin believes that the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] 
operations against Hizballah centers will not affect the 
negotiations. The understandings reached after Operation 
Accountability stipulate that just as Hizballah can act against 
SLA [South Lebanese Army] and IDF military targets, Israel can 
operate against Hizballah installations that are not located 
within civilian population centers. 
  [Rabin] As in the past, Hizballah continues to initiate 
terrorist attacks against us. We will not play by its rules. 
  [Roger] Yitzhaq Rabin, who spoke on behalf of various 
luminaries receiving honorary doctorates, reminded his audience 
that the 1967 war broke out exactly 27 years ago, saying that it 
was a war in which united Jerusalem became ours forever. 
Outside the Haifa University campus, the members of the Eretz 
Yisra'el Front demonstrated. Large police forces prevented them 
from entering the campus. [end recording] 
  [In a later report in the same newscast, Qol Yisra'el adds 
that, speaking yesterday, "Prime Minister Rabin said that the 
PLO has not yet adapted itself to assume responsibility for a 
civilian community." In a recorded passage, Rabin says: "Those 
who sought to assume responsibility for the area must also 
supply the people with occupations and the means to make a 
livelihood. I have no doubt that a process of adjustment is 
necessary. The PLO has never been responsible for the life of a 
community. If that organization wishes to mature and assume 
responsibility, it is high time it found the mechanisms that 
will enable the donor countries to give money, because the donor 
countries are prepared to contribute funds. The donor countries 
are all democracies, however, and it is inconceivable for them 
to just hand over $100 million to the PLO or its chairman and 
tell the Palestinians to do whatever they want with the money. 
As a result of their own internal structure and institutions, 
they can only contribute funds within the framework of a 
controlled budget, set out clearly in black and white, and the 
PLO has not yet adjusted to this."]

  [Text] Members of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense 
Committee headed by Knesset member [MK] Ori Or yesterday toured 
the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] Northern Command and south 
Lebanon. The committee members were briefed by senior Northern 
Command officers about the reasons for the Air Force attack on a 
Hizballah training camp in the Ba'labakk area. They were also 
briefed about possible terrorist attacks. 
  MK Or said that if Lebanon disarms Hizballah it will be 
possible to speak about evacuating the security zone. 
  Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu expressed support for the 
IDF operation in Lebanon and voiced total support for the 
government's decisions in this regard. 
  Meanwhile the state of alert on the northern border 
continues. Senior military sources said despite the fact that no 
Katyushas have been fired by Hizballah since Friday they are 
continuing their activity in the security zone. 
  The sources say that the terrorists are trying to plant 
explosive charges, to attack outposts, and to kidnap soldiers. 
The terrorists are also trying to smuggle suicide squads into 
the security zone for attacks against IDF and SLA [South 
Lebanese Army] forces. 
  "We are convinced that Hizballah will try to carry out a 
spectacular attack in retaliation for the Air Force attack," 
said a senior Northern Command source. 
  Major General Yitzhaq Mordekhay, commander of the Northern 
Command, will today brief the General Staff about recent 
developments in Lebanon.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ron Ben-Yishay: "The IDF is Taking an </F>
Aggressive Approach"] 
  [Text] Yesterday's attack by Israel Air Force [IAF] jets 
against a Hizballah training base in Lebanon's al-Biqa' was the 
strongest blow dealt to the organization in the past eight years. 
  Even before they had time to recover from the abduction of 
Mustafa al-Dirani, the leaders of the Hizballah lost dozens of 
their youngest fighters in the heart of their "security zone" in 
al-Biqa', under the nose of the Syrians and their antiaircraft 
missiles. 
  The two latest actions reflect a new, far more aggressive, 
approach recently adopted by the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
against hostile elements in Lebanon with the government's 
approval. In light of the deadlock in the negotiations with 
Syria, Israel has no reason to show the restraint and passivity 
which have characterized the IDF's activity in Lebanon until now. 
  In the absence of a better response, Hizballah resorted to 
the familiar: launching Katyusha rockets at towns in the 
Galilee. Judging from experience, this is not the last word. 
One can safely assume not only additional Katyusha volleys over 
the next few days but also a concentrated effort by Hizballah to 
attack IDF and SLA [South Lebanese Army] outposts and patrols in 
the security zone. There may be also be attempts to kidnap SLA 
and IDF soldiers. The situation may deteriorate in a way 
similar to the exacerbation that preceded Operation 
Accountability [July 1993]. 
  The difference is that this time, the IDF is taking the 
initiative while the Hizballah is only reacting, to a large 
extent out of helplessness. Another difference is the 
increasing effectiveness of the IDF offensives. 
  The IAF has attacked in Lebanon dozens of times in recent 
years, but only in rare cases has it managed to inflict a real 
blow on the terrorist organizations. Most of the benefit of 
these air raids lay in their deterrent effect and in their 
disruption of preparations for terrorist operations. Now, the 
fighting capabilities of the fundamentalist organization are 
increasingly being undermined. 
  Judging from recent operations, the IDF has acquired some 
intelligence information that enables it to strike at the root 
of the problem; or in other words, Hizballah's fighting corps. 
One can also discern an improvement in the IAF's capability to 
carry out surprise attacks against distant targets, despite the 
threats along the way (Syrian antiaircraft fire). This 
improvement in the IDF's "long arm" enables it to refrain from 
striking at the civilian populace which supports Hizballah, as 
was the case in the past. 
  Yesterday's IDF operation did not violate the understandings 
reached in the wake of Operation Accountability in July 1993. 
The target attacked, 'Ayn Zarzarah, was not a village but a 
major Hizballah training base several kilometers from the Syrian 
border. In any case, it does not matter whether or not Israel 
violated the understandings. Hizballah cannot allow itself not 
to retaliate against the recent attacks. The question is which 
form this reaction will take and how powerful it will be. It 
will also serve as a test for the new Israeli strategy. If the 
reaction is tolerable, and does not lead to a serious 
exacerbation, then the Israeli gamble has paid off and the 
recent operations have achieved their goal. But if we again 
find ourselves in a situation where Israel has to ask the 
Americans to mediate for a cease fire, with the help of Syria, 
then both the gamble and the new strategy have failed.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ze'ev Schiff: "A Signal to Damascus"] </F>
  [Text] The fierce Israeli Air Force attack against a 
Hizballah training facility in the Syrian-controlled area of the 
northern part of the al-Biqa' should be construed, among other 
things, as an Israeli signal to Damascus to the effect that 
Israel does not regard the talks between them as reason for 
preventing an operation against the extremist Shiite 
organization. 
  The Syrian angle was debated in Israel prior to the 
operation. In consultations held prior to the operation the 
political process with Syria was raised. The freeze in the 
talks between the two countries undoubtedly had an indirect 
effect on the decision adopted. Seeing that there is no danger 
of a military operation against Hizballah foiling such talks, 
the military consideration finally prevailed. Hizballah in any 
case is continuing its attacks against the IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] and SLA [South Lebanese Army] in south Lebanon without 
any consideration for the peace talks. In its operation Israel 
has signalled to Syria and Hizballah that its security 
considerations alone determine its mode of operation. 
  Those who made the decision to attack were aware of the 
possibility that Hizballah would retaliate with Katyusha attacks 
against our northern settlements -- as was actually the case 
yesterday. Israel believes, however, that the attack did not 
violate the understandings reached with U.S. mediation following 
Operation Accountability. According to this understanding 
Israeli settlements and Lebanese villages should not be attacked 
unless fire is directed from within them. Hizballah, however, 
is continuing its war against Israel in south Lebanon and has 
hit many IDF and SLA soldiers. The Israeli operation was in 
turn directed against a military training base for Hizballah 
fighters, most of whom are sent to carry out attacks in south 
Lebanon. 
  From the military point of view yesterday's attack can be 
considered to be one of the severest blows ever suffered by 
Hizballah. Many previous Air Force attacks ended with only few 
Hizballah casualties, whereas this time the organization 
suffered dozens of dead and wounded. The numbers involved 
constitute a considerable percentage of Hizballah's total 
fighting cadre, and are higher than the total casualty toll 
Hizballah suffered in Operation Accountability. The operation 
was carried out after 0200, under complete darkness, which 
indicates the kind of ability Israel's Air Force has developed 
for night operations. Lebanese sources say that the first wave 
was carried out by jet fighters, which were later joined by a 
second wave of helicopter gunships. It is clear that without 
early intelligence regarding the details of Hizballah's training 
base it would have been hard to locate the targets there. 
According to one assessment, Mustafa al-Dirani's abduction and 
interrogation in Israel improved Israel's familiarity with 
Hizballah and its military infrastructure.

The study was on the impact of GATT on Indian economy. 
  The study said prices of drugs will not rise before 2005 AD 
and this would give the Indian industry sufficient time to build 
its research and development activities. The study also says 
India stands to gain by about $4.5 billion by the turn of the 
century under the new trade setup with benefits of around $1.5 
to 2 billion in the initial years. The increase in trade is 
likely to occur from the tariff reduction on a number of 
agricultural and industrial products.

  [Text] New Delhi 31 May -- Even as the heat and dust raised 
by the campaigning for the seven Lok Sabha and 10 assembly seats 
has subsided, the outcome has given rise to a new debate in the 
political circles with the various parties discussing whether 
the GATT treaty was an issue or not in Thursday's `trial of 
strength'. 
  The provocation for this has come from the Congress(I) which 
was quick to term its success in winning five of the seven Lok 
Sabha seats that were at stake as popular endorsement of the 
government's signing the multilateral trade pact. The party's 
official spokesman, Mr V N Gadgil, fired the first salvo in this 
regard when he asserted on Monday that the success of the 
Congress(I) represented a definite rejection of the Opposition's 
"propaganda" on GATT. 
  To buttress his point, Mr Gadgil stressed the fact that all 
the constituencies which went the Congress(I) way happened to be 
rural ones and that it clearly showed that the people in the 
countryside have not bought the Opposition's charge of sell-out 
by the government. 
  While the Opposition parties are not as elated as the 
Congress(I), they nevertheless are not ready to let Mr Gadgil's 
claim go uncontested. "Who said GATT was an electoral issue," 
snapped the Janata Dal leader, Mr Jaipal Reddy when asked to 
react on Mr Gadgil's assertion. 
  He reeled off detailed statistics to substantiate his 
contention. "The Congress(I) has not wrested any seat but 
retained the 5 seats and that too with reduced margins. In UP 
[Uttar Pradesh], Bihar and Tamil Nadu, which account for 178 Lok 
Sabha seats, the Congress(I) has come third or fourth. In fact, 
they have been losing in these states since 1989," the leader of 
the Janata Dal said. 
  Mr Reddy further argued that "if anything, the results only 
show a steady decline of Congress(I)'s influence and the premise 
that their stand on Gatt stood vindicated was clearly wrong." 
  Mr Sitaram Yechury, member of the CPI(M) [Communist Party of 
India -- Marxist] politburo, was equally dismissive of Mr 
Gadgil's contention. "A bogus claim" was how Mr Yechury 
described the Congress(I)'s statement. "The return of 5 sitting 
MPs and that too with vastly reduced margins can hardly be 
described as an index of Congress(I)'s popularity and in no case 
a popular vindication of its stand on Gatt". 
  Significantly, the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party], which is 
pulling in a different direction than the left parties and the 
Janata Dal on a host of issues, seems to be for a change in 
agreement with them at least on this one. Mr K N Govindacharya, 
party's general secretary, hotly disputed the claim of Mr 
Gadgil. According to him, the elections were not contested on 
any specific issue like GATT. "The agenda this time was 
scattered and varied from place to place with the local issues 
dominating." 
  The BJP leader went to the extent of calling it an issueless 
election. Questioning Mr Gadgil's interpretation of his party's 
performance, Mr Govindacharya was of the opinion that the 
victory of the ruling party in Madhya Pradesh and Himachal 
Pradesh had more to do with the `honeymoon factor' than anything 
else. 
  For his part, however, Mr Gadgil remains totally unfazed. 
Asked to comment on the arguments put forward by the Opposition 
parties the Congress(I)'s spokesman said that the "Opposition 
did make the GATT an issue in the by-polls. In fact, if there 
was one issue they chose to highlight all over, it was GATT and 
nothing else." 
  He also remains unimpressed by the opinion in the political 
circles that the Congress(I) did not perform too well in West 
Bengal where the CPI(M) had really done its best to use the 
Union government's stand on GATT as its principal weapon against 
the Congress(I). 
  The debate is likely to intensify further, especially when 
the government brings forward in Parliament the legislations it 
needs to enact for complying with its obligations under the GATT 
agreement. And if the Congress(I) is hoping that the outcome 
would make the Opposition parties relent on their stand, it is 
certain that its expectations may not quite materialise.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "GATT Out"] </F>
  [Text] Opposition leaders say that GATT was not an issue in 
the recent by-elections. They are shaken by the fact that they 
failed to make a dent in the Congress armour. Their frenzied 
rallies and nightmarish stories about MNCs [multinational 
corporations] invasion were conveniently forgotten. But it was 
an issue, says the Congress spokesman, Mr V N Gadgil, gleefully. 
He interprets the election results as vindication of his 
party's stand on GATT and the voters' rejection of the 
opposition propaganda. Considering the asinine way in which 
both sides presented the case for and against GATT in the rural 
areas, it would seem that they think voters are morons. The 
party strategists' confusion was ably summed up by the BJP's 
[Bharatiya Janata Party] general secretary, the 'whizchalak' 
[whiz kid] Govindacharya, when he said the elections were not 
contested on any specific issue like GATT and the agenda was 
dominated by local issues. 
  In that statement lies a glimmer of political understanding. 
Except when there is a charismatic leader, elections tend to get 
fought on local issues. Like the politician, the voter wants to 
know what he or she will get out of the polls. Voters are 
willing to forgive a leader his corruption provided he can get 
things done for his constituency. Voters can be united on one 
issue only when there is a fear of a systemic breakdown, when 
the arrogance of power rides roughshod over citizens' basic 
rights or a weak central authority allows the emergence of local 
dons. Voters then demand a drastic change and vote with a 
vengeance to achieve their goal. Political skill lies in 
watching the swing of the pendulum -- the ruling party's task is 
to slow it down and the opposition's to accelerate it. 
  Experience has made the Indian voter wary. He has noted that 
non-Congress governments do not impart a better direction. He 
then gives them a thump on the head, and the Congress soon 
restores the familiar status quo. And it's back to local issues 
again, at which Congress leaders have shown themselves more 
adept than the opposition ones who all vie for national glory 
right from the outset. The opposition would fare better if they 
borrowed President Clinton's slogan and put up a modification in 
all their party offices: "It's the local economy, stupid".

<F P=106> [By Suman Chattopadhya] </F>
  [Text] The Rao-Clinton joint news conference just 
concluded. When all of us were coming down the stairs of the 
White House after the conference, a young journalist from 
Gujarat, who was a member of the prime minister's entourage, 
loudly told a senior journalist from THE WASHINGTON POST, "Had 
this been our country then at least for the sake of courtesy, we 
would have asked your president some questions, but you have 
insulted our prime minister by not asking him any questions." 
The American journalist was not at all offended by this remark. 
He smiled and softly told the youth to come with his prime 
minister when he visits the White House after five years. He 
then added that at that time, you will not find us as 
indifferent. 
  This spontaneous anger of the unexperienced Indian 
journalist 
was 100 percent genuine. It is really difficult for 
professional Indian journalists to tolerate the disregard shown 
toward their prime minister by American journalists. This 
proves that American journalists do not give any importance to 
the country where about one sixth of the total world population 
lives. 
  Rajiv Gandhi was able to create a lot of enthusiasm in the 
U.S. media during his first visit to the United States in 1985, 
but Narasimha Rao failed to generate even a fraction of that 
enthusiasm. The major U.S. newspapers gave wide coverage to the 
press conference which was addressed by Rajiv Gandhi at the 
National Press Club in Washington. This time, the newspapers 
thought it a waste to spare space to cover Rao. During Rajiv 
Gandhi's visit, THE NEW YORK TIMES criticized the Reagan 
administration for trying to impress Gandhi by showing robots to 
him. The newspaper said "India must be reckoned with in deeper 
terms than by displaying robots or space capsules to as 
sophisticated a man as Rajiv Gandhi." This time, due to the 
request made by the Indian Embassy, only THE WASHINGTON POST 
agreed to write a short report on Rao's visit. It wrote: "A 
small bald figure in a Congress Party grey suit, a man with a 
shy manner and a low voice, a man who is a total stranger to the 
(?sound bite) [as published], the Indian prime minister is not 
easily recognizable as a politician." It is unfortunate for the 
senior, learned, and experienced prime minister of India that 
popular television networks like NBC or ABC did not feel it 
necessary to give even one minute's coverage to him. 
  Did Rao really deserve the neglect which was shown him by 
the 
U.S. media? Rajiv Gandhi was able to attract American 
journalists due to his amiable disposition, westernized outlook, 
and alluring personality. Rao had something valuable in his 
pocket which the Americans should have been attracted to, that 
is, a market economy. The media did not give much importance to 
Narasimha Rao this time as they are not very aware of the 
developments which are taking place in the Indian subcontinent. 
Despite this, there is no denying the fact that India will soon 
become very important to the U.S. media just as China has 
become. The Clinton administration was reluctant to give most 
favored nation treatment to Beijing as its human rights record 
was not satisfactory. This enraged the U.S. media. The U.S. 
media is of the opinion that nothing should be done which would 
hamper bilateral trade ties with China. 
  Americans continuously shed tears for the cause of 
democracy, 
but why is the U.S. media so keen to keep the communist 
dictators of Beijing happy. This is so because their only 
objective is trade. If Beijing does not get most favored nation 
status due to the rashness of Clinton, then U.S. industrialists 
will be affected and the interests of the country will be 
hampered. Their main objective is to protect the economic 
interests of the United States. It should be achieved at any 
cost even if it is necessary to renounce the country's policies. 
It has been observed that Beijing did not make any special 
efforts to secure most favored nation status. The industrial 
corporations and the U.S. media are working together to protect 
the interests of the Chinese leaders, Deng Xiaoping and Li Peng. 
  India will also be able to acquire this importance after 
the United States becomes involved in its market. The first and 
foremost requirement is to attract U.S. capital. During his 
visit to the United States, to some extent Narasimha Rao has 
been able to attract U.S. businessmen to India. This is the 
most significant aspect of his visit to that country. These 
people were able to realize the amount of profit they can make 
by investing in India. It is true they have been impressed by 
the reform measures initiated by Rao and Manmohan. U.S. 
businessmen have started realizing that this country of hermits 
and snake charmers have a middle class population of about 200 
million people, who have great purchasing power. There was no 
one in the United States to speak in favor of India in the past. 
At present, a lobby of industrialists has been formed in favor 
of India. Some key persons of giant U.S. corporations have also 
joined this group. A new horizon of prospects has been created 
in front of their eyes -- the largest free market of the 21st 
century. 
  Their eagerness towards this country is new and it must be 
admitted that India will gain from it. The first benefit is 
economic. This is because India is desperately in need of 
foreign capital, particularly in the sphere of infrastructure. 
The second gain is political. Due to growing U.S. interests in 
India, other sensitive political issues like Kashmir and the 
nonproliferation issue will gradually lose significance. 
President Clinton and his colleagues did not make any attempt 
to embarrass Rao on these issues during his recent visit. The 
main reason behind this is pressure from industrialists. If the 
United States remains passive on these issues, then Islamabad 
will have to suffer. In fact, it is the intention of India to 
blunt the sharp mouth of Islamabad. 
  To sum up, it may be said that in this post Cold War era, it 
is essential to improve ties with the United States. It is 
necessary to play the economic card well to establish this 
relationship. Narasimha Rao's visit has created prospects for 
the establishment of friendly relations between the two 
countries. This relationship will be further strengthened if 
the pledges given by Rao and Manmohan regarding economic reforms 
are speedily implemented. Once capital is invested in this 
country, then it is bound to influence the White House and the 
U.S. media. After this, if the Indian prime minister goes to 
address a joint news conference with the U.S. president, then 
all cameras will be focussed on the Indian prime minister. This 
will fulfill the predictions made by the American journalist to 
the Gujarati youth.

<F P=106> [By Santanu Saikia] </F>
  [Text] Finance Minister Manmohan Singh has estimated that 
disinvestment of shares of public sector undertakings (PSUs) in 
1994-95 can mop up as much as Rs [rupees] 8000 crore, twice the 
amount earmarked for mobilisation in the budget estimates. 
  Beyond the Rs 4000 crore mark, receipts from disinvestment 
will be used to reduce escalating Government debt, Singh said in 
a note to the Cabinet last week. 
  Though scalded by a Public Accounts Committee (PAC) 
indictment on the manner in which shares were disinvested in 
1990-91, Singh has decided to push ahead with a bold 
disinvestment programme this year too. He has identified 28 
PSUs whose shares would be off-loaded. 
  Besides the traditional auction mechanism, two new routes 
have been identified for disinvesting PSU shares. One is to 
ride piggyback on PSUs when they tap the stock market to expand 
their equity base. Disinvestments would be clubbed with a 
premium equity or rights issue of a PSU. 
  The other new method would be to directly tap the Global 
Depository receipts (GDR) market for large-scale disinvestments 
as foreign markets have the necessary depth to absorb large 
issues of risk capital. Riding piggyback with a PSU flotation 
in the GDR market is an additional mechanism that may be tapped. 
  In a marked departure from previous disinvestment 
programmes, 
Singh has proposed equal sharing of proceeds between PSUs and 
Government. Half the funds mopped up through disinvestment will 
go PSUs, to take care of their own internal requirements. 
  The note said auctions will be held several times during the 
year. The public issue route will be open throughout the year, 
though the preferred time of entry will be when there is 
sufficient buoyancy in the market. 
  Of the 237 PSUs in the country, only 37 qualify for 
disinvestment based on the yardstick of consistent profitability 
over the last three years, and large free reserves equal to or 
higher than the paid-up capital (which can give rise to a bonus 
issue subsequently). Some PSUs have not been taken up for 
disinvestment despite being profitable, as the free reserves are 
not large enough vis-a-vis the paid-up capital. 
  After completion of all formalities, including capital 
restructuring and capitalisation, the following companies have 
been identified for disinvestment: Bharat Petroleum, Cochin 
Refineries, IBP [expansion unknown], Lubrizo, ONGC [Oil and 
Natural Gas Commission], OIL [expansion unknown], Indian Oil, 
HOC [expansion unknown], IPCL [Indian Petrochemicals Corporation 
Limited], VSNL [expansion unknown], MTNL [Mahanagar Telephone 
Nigam Limited], BHEL [Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited], Nyveli 
Lignite Corp, Andrew Yule, ITI [expansion unknown], Hind 
Teleprinters, BEL [Bharat Electronics Limited], BEML [expansion 
unknown], Shipping Corp, Air India, Dredging Corp, IRCON [Indian 
Railway Construction Company], NALCO [expansion unknown], HMT 
[Hindustan Machine Tools], SAIL [Steel Authority of India], 
State Trading Corporation, Mineral and Metals Trading 
Corporation and MSTC [expansion unknown]. 
  PSUs like Steel Authority of India (SAIL), HMT and State 
Trading Corporation will have to wait in the wings until 
adequate capital restructuring takes place. And units like 
Hindustan Zinc, Hindustan Copper, Rashtriya Chemicals &amp; 
Fertilisers and Fertilizers &amp; Chemicals Travancore Limited, 
which lack a friendly investors' perspective, will not be 
offloaded until the outlook improves. 
  Sensitive PSUs -- from the national view point -- Hindustan 
Auronatics, Central Warehouse Corporation, Cotton Corporation of 
India etc -- will not qualify for disinvestment. 
  In the negative list will also be shares where disinvestment 
has brought Government holdings down to the critical level of 51 
per cent. They are Hindustan Petroleum Ltd and Madras 
Refineries. 
  Shares of Indian Oil, Oil India, ONGC, Air India, Lubrizol, 
IBP and Hindustan Teleprinters will be sold only after adequate 
capitalisation of free reserves takes place, by way of bonus 
shares issued to the Government. 
  If shares are sold by public auction, the minimum bid will 
continue to be at Rs 25,000 or the value of 100 shares, 
whichever higher. The reserve price of shares will-be fixed in 
consultation with the International Development Bank of India 
and Industrial Finance Corporation of India. Ten per cent of 
the bid value will have to be deposited with authorities before 
bidding starts.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Journalist Venkatnarain] </F>
  [Text] India appears all set to induct and deploy the short 
range surface-to-surface missile, Prithvi, with the Army 
successfully conducting the second user trial of this 
indigenously developed world class weapon system yesterday. 
Prithvi was already tested a dozen times by the Defense 
Research and Development Organization over a five-year period 
between 1988 and 1993. Last Saturday, the Army began the 
crucial preinduction trial phase with its first user trial. 
Yesterday's launch was to the missile's maximum range of 250 
kms and all the mission requirements were achieved. The entire 
exercise of the user trials is likely to be completed by the end 
of next month. Prithvi will then be cleared for induction into 
the defense forces. There may be at least six more user trials 
in battlefield conditions. 
  The Army has opted for Prithvi with a shorter ranger of 150 
kms. These missiles have the capability of carrying the more 
lethal one ton warhead payload. However, the Indian Air Force 
is opting for the 250 km range version to safeguard its forward 
air bases as well as to bring enemy forward bases within 
Prithvi's range. This will carry half a ton warhead. 
  When Prithvi's first experimental launch was successful in 
1988, Western security analysts could hardly believe that India 
could develop the missile system entirely on its own. When 
Prithvi's induction and deployment seemed imminent in 1992, the 
United States imposed trade sanctions on India. They are still 
in force, but have not prevented our scientists from developing 
this liquid propelled new generation ballistic missile. 
Prithvi's liquid engine enables its flight to be controlled 
through real time commands on board computer. [sentence as 
heard] Its altitude and range thus become greatly flexible and 
it has six alternate preprogrammed trajectories. All these make 
it far superior to the Patriot and Scud missiles which performed 
dismally during the Gulf war. Prithvi's designers and main users 
see it as an accurate weapons system that can deliver very 
specific military objectives ranging from a tactical 
battlefield, heavy artillery support system to long range 
knocking off of enemy supplies by striking at bridges, roads, 
air fields, railroads, marshalling yards, and so on. 
  Prithvi's induction and deployment into the defense forces 
will certainly enhance India's overall security by acting as a 
deterrent. Once its sister missiles like the Trishul, the Akash, 
the Nag, and the Agni make their way into the defense forces, 
any enemy will have to think more than twice before launching a 
conventional military adventure against India.

<F P=106> [Report by Ranjit Kumar] </F>
  [Text] The induction of one more indigenously built 
submarine into the Indian Navy may give a feeling of temporary 
relief to the Navy, but it has to get ready for the days when 
its submarine capability will continue to decline in the coming 
years. With the induction of this German designed Type-1500 
submarine built at the Indian Naval Dockyard, the number of 
submarines in the Indian Navy has gone up to 19, but India's 
submarine capability will continue to decline from next year. 
To compensate for the expected shortfall and to maintain strike 
capability, the Indian Navy has prepared a 15-year plan, but 
there is no possibility of implementing the plan due to a lack 
of financial resources. 
  At the end of the seventies, the Indian Navy had acquired 
eight Foxtrot class submarines from the Soviet Union. These 
submarines are more than 25 years old now, meaning end of their 
life span. One of these submarines was retired last year. Now 
these Foxtrot class submarines are in line for retirement one 
after another. Thus, all Foxtrots will be retired in the next 
five to six years. If no new submarines are added, the number 
of submarines India operates will be reduced to 12. 
  Other than the Foxtrot class of submarines, the Indian Navy 
has eight 'Kilo' class submarines from Russia. These submarines 
were acquired by the end of the eighties. During the same time, 
two German H.D.W. Type-1500 submarines were directly purchased. 
An agreement with Germany was reached where it will assist in 
the design and building of four such submarines for the Indian 
Navy. India has already built two of these submarines, but the 
Indian Government has not taken any decision to build the other 
two because of lack of finances. It costs four billion rupees 
to build a submarine and in the current year only 27.38 billion 
have been allocated to the Navy out of the defense budget -- 
about 13 percent of the total defense budget. It is paradoxical 
for the Navy that it not only has to fix funds for the new 
submarines to replace the retiring Foxtrots from this limited 
budget, but it also has to goad the government into giving a 
green signal for the construction of a new aircraft carrier to 
replace the retiring air craft carrier Vikrant. The 
construction of an aircraft carrier could cost 10 billion 
rupees. The Navy also has to find financial resources for the 
timely completion of some other now under-construction modern 
warships. These are all top-priority plans for the Navy and it 
cannot shirk the responsibility of implementing them by 
describing one plan as less important than another. Now the 
onus rests with the government to take new initiatives to 
maintain the submarine capability. 
  Indians have acquired the unique experience of submarine 
construction under German license at the Mazagaon Naval 
Dockyard, which has given the confidence to the Indian 
scientists that they can build indigenously designed submarines. 
Meanwhile, the Indian Government retains the right to build two 
more submarines under the German license. Although Prime 
Minister Narasimha Rao, while handing over the submarine INS 
Shankul to the Navy at the Mazagaon Naval Dockyard in Bombay, 
said that more budget will be allocated for the Navy in view of 
the immense sea challenges posed to it, he gave no hint as to 
when the construction of the next submarine will commence. It 
looks like the capability acquired by the Indian Naval Dockyard 
will remain unutilized. The director general of the Mazagaon 
Dockyard also urged the prime minister to direct the dockyard to 
build more submarines to use the acquired facilities. 
  The first submarine under the German design was built two 
years ago. This makes it clear that it takes up to two years to 
build a submarine. So, even if India gives an order now to 
build another submarine, it will be two years before a new 
submarine is inducted. Obviously, India now will have to pay 
special attention to maintaining its submarine capability during 
the transitional period. In fact, in view of the possibility of 
retiring Foxtrots one after another, the Defense Ministry should 
have ordered the construction of new submarines long ago to 
maintain continuity in the submarine building process. With 
this option unavailable now, it is feared that the Indian Navy's 
submarine capability will continue to decline in the coming 
years. 
  According to naval experts, the Foxtrot series of submarines 
will prove ineffective in the modern naval warfare scenario. 
Moreover, these submarines remain in dock for maintenance and 
repair work more than half the time. Naval sources say that 
these submarines have become so old their maintenance is proving 
too costly for the Navy. That is why they cannot be considered 
effective for strategic reasons. 
  While the Indian Navy's submarine capability will continue 
to 
decline in the coming years, the Pakistan Navy is restless to 
acquire three most sophisticated submarines. For the time 
being, Pakistan has eight submarines and this number will go up 
to 11 or 12 with the induction of new submarines. Pakistan soon 
is going to purchase three 'Agosta' series of sophisticated 
submarines from France. Pakistan also is going to receive P-3-C 
Orion aircraft, which are used for antisubmarine search and 
destroy operations. With the help of three such aircraft, 
Pakistan can render the Indian Naval fleet ineffective. 
  Other than Pakistan, the Chinese Navy is also a cause of 
serious concern for India because its submarines have been seen 
strolling in the Andaman Sea in the name of cooperation with the 
Burmese Navy. China at present has more than 100 submarines, out 
of which 20 are nuclear powered. China's 'Xia' class of 
submarines can even fire long-range ballistic missiles. In view 
of the submarine capabilities of China and Pakistan, the strong 
possibility of declining Indian capability is a cause of 
strategic concern.

<F P=106> [Article by Ajoy Base: "Stronger Than Ever"] </F>
  [Text] Mr P V Narasimha Rao is perhaps the first Prime 
Minister of this country to approach the fourth year of his 
five-year term in office looking actully stronger than he did 
when he first assumed power. 
  The outcome of the recent round of by-elections spread 
across 
the country may or may not be wholly reflectvie of the popular 
mood, but it has certainly served to further boost Mr Narasimha 
Rao's position. Even if one were to view the Congress victories 
in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal pradesh, Punjab, Orissa 
and Andhra Pradesh as individual aberrations, there surely must 
be some lesson to be drawn from the fact that out of 18 
parliamentary and assembly seats which went to the hustings, the 
ruling party won as many as 10 while its two main national 
opponents, BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] and Janata Dal, managed 
respectively two and none. 
  This relative supremacy of the Congress; under Mr Narasimha 
Rao's leadership over political rivals is all the more 
creditworthy in the light of the party's performance in bypolls 
under past Prime Ministers in mid-term. Both Mrs Indira Gandhi 
and her son and successor looked distinctly vulnerable after 
their honeymoon period with the electoral had worn off and 
invariably tended to lose bypolls: And as for non-Congress Prime 
Minister of yore, none of them even managed to last at the 
Centre long enough the middle of their full term in office. 
  There are other crucial differences between Mr Narasimha Rao 
and his predecessors in the Prime Minister's chair. The 
pupularity graphs of leaders like Mrs Indira Gandhi and Rajiv 
Gandhi and even those of Mr Morarji Desai and Mr V P Singh 
tended to follow an uniform pattern. They rose dramatically 
when these Prime Ministers first assumed power and then started 
slumping as disillusionment set in with their respective regimes. 
  Mr Narasimha Rao's graph, on the other hand, has followed a 
more complex course. He became Prime Minister amidst few 
expectations and was in fact widely considered to be a stop gap 
leader to be cast aside as soon as Mrs Sonia Gandhi or some 
powerful Congress boss managed to seize power. 
  His graph rose, however, when in, the first year of ofice he 
staved off such challenges in a quiet and dogged manner but then 
on a downward spiral after the demolition of the Babri Masjid 
and the corruption charges levelled by Mr Harshad Mehta. Now 
that the Prime Minister has not only managed to survive the 
crises of last year but emerged the leader of a reasonably 
stable government with a full-fledged majority in the Lok Sabha, 
his stock has once again mounted. 
  Not surprisingly, this checkered political track record 
which 
if nothing else illustrated Mr Sarasimha Rao's ability to handle 
the rough as well as the smooth has pushed to the corner his 
opponents within the Congress and outside. Former ruling party 
dissidents like Mr Arjun Singh and Mr Sharad Pawar have become 
increasingly wary of openly crossing swords with the Prime 
Minister and the dissidence which had once threatened to engulf 
the Congress has virtually faded away over recent months. 
  More importantly, there is a new respect within the party 
for 
Mr Narasimha Rao's political judgement which was not there 
before. Most Congressmen today grudgingly admit that even the 
Prime Minister's only palpable blunder over the Babri Masjid 
demolition may not have been a mistake after all but a shredw 
piece of procrastination. 
  They concede that while dismissing the Kalyan Singh 
Government or order fire at the militing masses at Ayodhya to 
protect that mosque may have been morally right and brave but 
could have had disastrous political consequences for the party 
if a enervated BJP had swept Uttar Pradesh in the subsequent 
election. Mr Rao's prescription of patiently riding out the 
saffron wave was indeed painful for those in the Congress used 
to Mrs Gandhi's penchant to do open battle but in hindsight now 
seems to have been the correct' strategy. 
  There is also far less panic in the ruling party about being 
swallowed by either the Mandir or the Mandal Wole. Congressmen 
realise that the wheels of the Sangh Parivar's judggernaut has 
got badly stuck after the denouncement of last year's Assemby 
polls while the Janata Dal's missionary zeal in promoting a 
caste revolution has not been able to prevent the steady 
disintegration of the party. 
  This is not to suggest that Mr Rao has managed to 
orchestrate 
a resurgence of the Congress. There are no indications 
whatsoever of the party reviving in states like Uttar Pradesh 
and Bihar where it has become even more marginalised than before. 
  Yet there are few partymen today who would support an 
alternative leader to Mr Rao who after all has shown the way of 
keeping a political fossil like the Congress alive at the centre 
without the life support of the country's two largest states. 
Many of them privately criticise the Prime Minister's 
reluctance to revamp the party organisation in Uttar Pradesh and 
Bihar but at the same time acknowledge the Herculean nature of 
this task. Some have even started to say that Mr Rao may be 
making the best of a bad job. 
  General public perceptions of Mr Rao are more difficult to 
pin down. But there is little doubt that he has emerged a 
seasoned leader who for all his flaws has been able to rise out 
of political turmoil to give the country a relatively stable 
government than his immediate predecessors. 
  Jokes about the Prime Minister's notorious indecisive nature 
still do the media circles and perhaps have some justification 
but they no longer raise the sort of derisive laughter at the 
popular level. After all it is difficult to sneer at a leader 
for faillng to take decisions when he manages to come out on the 
top everytime by doing so. 
  In fact, there are some people who see Mr Rao as a wise 
stateman who realising the limitations of the party he leads and 
the country he rules gives time for problems to resolve 
themselves. They see his foreign policy successes as well as his 
ability to manage contradictions at home as signs of a Prime 
Minister who may be the best candidate for leading such a large 
and diverse nation as India. 
  Much of this present aura about Mr. Rao could quickly vanish 
if his political career hits another iceberg. People are quick 
to change their perceptions about leaders and a major economic 
disaster or communal turbulence may well send the Prime 
Minister's image plunging down again. 
  Yet, considering Mr Rao's proven skill of surmounting 
disasters without appearing to put much effort, most may 
hesitate before writing the obituary of a Prime Minister who has 
proved his detractors wrong so many times before.

  [Text] The managers of Indian economy are jubilant over the 
fact that exports grew by over 20 per cent in dollar terms in 
1993-94, the third year of economic reform. This is being cited 
as the most outstanding outcome of economic liberalisation. 
Trade deficit declined to $1,039 million, the lowest in the 
last decade or so. 
  Economists and analysts agree that export performance in 
1993-94 is impressive viewed against the dismal show in the 
preceeding two years. But, there is nothing much to crow about 
in this because India had far better performance on the export 
front in the not too distant past. For instance, the 
performance in 1987-88 exports grew by 24 per cent in dollar 
terms. 
  During the pre-reform years, 1986-87 to 1990-91, exports 
registered a total growth of 103 per cent, an annual compound 
growth of 15.3 per cent. In comparison, total export growth for 
the three reform years beginning 1991-92 worked out to only 22.2 
per cent, an annual compound growth of 6.9 per cent. In the 
first reform year, the growth was a negative 1.5 per cent. In 
1992-93, exports registered a 3.8 per cent growth. From this 
level, it was a real surge in 1993-94 to 20.4 per cent. 
  Commerce Ministry arrived at this growth rate for 1993-94 by 
comparing the estimated export earnings of $22,173 million 
during the year with a provisional figure of $18,420 million in 
1992-93. Government had the actual figure for 1992-93. The 
comparison, therefore, should have been with the actual figure 
and not the provisional figure for 1942-93. When compared with 
the actual figure of $18537 million in 1992-93, the export 
growth in 1993-94 dips below 20 per cent. 
  The real reason behind the reduced trade deficit is not the 
"booming" exports but the declining imports. In the first year 
of reform, imports were drastically pruned. This resulted in a 
negative growth of 19.4 per cent in 1991-92. Relaxations in 
import restrictions led to a 12.7 per cent growth in 1992-93. 
Although, the last month of 1993-94 registered a 68 per cent 
growth in imports, the total import growth for the year declined 
to 6.8 per cent. The total import bill of $ 23,212 million in 
1993-94, the third year of economic reform, is less than the 
import bill of $24,073 million in the pre-reform year of 1990-91. 
  Despite the relatively impressive export performance in the 
pre-reform years, export earnings could not finance more than 70 
per cent of the import bill during 1986-87 to 1990-91. But, a 
less impressive export growth in the reform years has managed to 
finance more than 85 per cent of the import bill. In 1991-92, 
92 per cent of the import bill was financed by export earnings. 
  The percentage of import bill financed through export 
earnings has thus been increasing in recent years. This would 
not have been possible had imports maintained the growth 
momentum of the pre-reform years. In a growing economy, imports 
are bound to grow. This has not happened in India even after 
three years of economic reform.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Mas'ud Khaleqi: "And Yet, There Is Room for </F>
Concern"-- punctuation as published] 
  [Text] On Tuesday 24 May, the esteemed Majles speaker, who 
attended a news conference with foreign and domestic 
correspondents, said in answer to a question put to him by a 
correspondent of Japan's NHK Television on what he thinks of the 
importation of American goods into the country and the 
possibility that these goods may affect the culture of Islamic 
Iran: "We are not concerned about the importation of some 
American goods into our country and the American culture that 
they can bring in. Our Islamic and national culture is too 
strong to be negatively affected by such minor issues...." 
  We too fully agree with the remarks by the esteemed Majles 
speaker, that our country has a rich and strong Islamic and 
national culture. But contrary to his view, we are extremely 
concerned over the importation of some American goods and the 
bad effects that this may have, and we believe that this issue 
should be studied from several aspects. In our opinion, we 
should pose this question from another angle and ask the 
esteemed Majles speaker: What vital need does our country have 
for American soft drinks and cigarettes? And what dangers can 
the banning of such imports have on our Islamic homeland? We 
should also recall that during last year's session of the G-7, 
the Americans placed the topic of banning the export of 
technology to Iran on their agenda and insisted--together with 
the British Government--that this decision be approved. And 
today, if in some part of the industrial world there is a 
country or a company that is transferring technology to Islamic 
Iran, it becomes the target of strong criticisms by the American 
bully.... And finally, the esteemed Majles speaker, who is a 
revolutionary figure with a bright record, definitely knows that 
the sale of American technology and of the diplomacy of 
exploiting this technology go hand in hand, as do their arms 
sales and arms policy. This point is so clear that it does not 
need any further explanation. 
  Therefore, if "some American goods" means items like Coca 
Cola, Pepsi Cola, cigarettes, chocolate, chips, and so on--that 
is, items for which the country has no need--the importation and 
sale of these items is an insult to the Muslim nation and to 
those who have shed their blood for this nation. And if 
American goods means technological products, then the Americans 
sell such products only if this sale is coupled with the 
acceptance--by the buyer--of the policy that they want to be 
accepted. But this is only one side of the coin. The other 
side of the coin should be sought in the views of our late imam, 
may his soul be sanctified, when he boycotted American imports. 
We believe that opening up the market of Islamic Iran to 
American goods will fill the pockets of the bloodthirsty and 
plundering capitalists of that country with astronomical 
profits, and will greatly harm our economy, while also helping 
the Americans do what they usually do in other countries--that 
is, couple the export of their products with the export of their 
culture and influence. But the sagacious view of our late imam, 
may his soul be sanctified, on the significance of boycotting 
American products is much more profound than this. A mere part 
of what he meant can be seen in his remarks that: The 
boycotting of American products will keep alive the deep 
hostility and spite as well as the memory of the crimes 
perpetrated by the Americans against our Muslim and oppressed 
nation in the minds of future generations and will prevent them 
from forgetting this hatred. 
  On the other hand, Islamic Iran has been recognized as the 
standard-bearer of pure Mohammedan Islam among the Muslim 
nations, and all facts show that the other Muslims consider 
Islamic Iran's actions to be an acceptable pattern that they too 
can follow. The boycotting of American products is tantamount 
to a line that is drawn between Islam and its major 
enemy--America. The answer to the question of why Islamic Iran 
has boycotted American goods shows the true identity of the 
great satan; and this is what our generation needs today. 
  Finally, we are well aware of the fact that the esteemed 
Majles speaker's remarks did not mean that he was issuing a 
permit for the import and sale of American goods, but that they 
referred to the wealth of our Islamic and national culture and 
an effort to remove any misgivings that the import of some 
American goods means that we will ignore the principle of not 
having relations with America. In another part of his news 
conference he also explicitly referred to this issue. However, 
the concern does exist that there will be some who will exploit 
part of his remarks.

<F P=106> [From the Foreign Policy Desk: "The United States, Saudi </F>
Arabia, and the Policy of Fomenting Tension in the Region"] 
  [Text] Every once in a while, U.S. officials address issues 
concerning the important Persian Gulf region and express the 
stances of their government on the political and security 
aspects of the issues. Even though these utterances may be 
projected as logical and popular, a deeper and precise 
examination will assist us to perceiving the ill-intentioned 
U.S. objectives. 
  In this regard, the presidential adviser for national 
security affairs, Anthony Lake, spoke recently on the Persian 
Gulf region and explained his country's stance. In his remarks, 
in order to capitalize further on the resources of the Arabs of 
the region, he once more waxed eloquent on the defeated policy 
of dual containment of Iraq and Iran and stressed the dangers 
from both these countries to the regional countries. 
  Even though one should admit that Washington's plan for dual 
containment of Iran and Iraq stems from a lack of understanding 
of the realities and how the needs of the region relate to U.S. 
foreign policy, by making such claims the United States is 
paving the way for a greater presence in the region. 
  In his remarks, Anthony Lake spoke in general terms of 
"extremism." Dividing it into religious and national extremism, 
he claimed that both were dangerous for the United States and 
the region. Extremism is one of those expressions frequently 
used by Americans, but they have never clearly defined what they 
actually mean by this term. 
  Even though extremism is even denounced in the religion of 
Islam, the U.S. hierarchy and, naturally, the regional Gulf 
officials have a different concept of extremism as compared with 
the usual concept. 
  From Washington's point of view, the term "extremism" 
applies 
to any individual or government not willing to officially 
recognize the illegitimate U.S. interests in various countries 
around the world. The Americans freely label anyone who does not 
succumb to their domination as an extremist, even though they 
have not yet presented any specific definition of this term. 
  For example, they refer to the Lebanese Hizballah as a 
conspicuous example of extremism. Have the Hizballah carried 
out any action other than armed resistance--which is the last 
resort of resistance--in the face of usurpation? Unfortunately, 
in today's world all kinds of freedom-seekers are suppressed by 
false accusations and even by force at sword point; and the 
subsequent struggle is labeled extremism. 
  Lake also rejected the notion of a war between the West and 
Islam after the collapse of the Eastern bloc and communism. 
While his own country is engaged in a multifaceted war against 
Islam in various parts of the world, Lake claims that the United 
States is strongly opposed to the view that the United States 
should go to war against Islam in the aftermath of the failure 
of communism. 
  Lake claimed that his country has no intentions of 
dominating 
the Middle East. Addressing these countries, he said that 
progress in the peace process will give the Middle Eastern 
countries an opportunity to embark on improving their economy 
and the lives of their people instead of squandering their 
resources purchasing weapons. 
  The realities in the region however belie his allegations. 
The establishment of military, air, and naval bases in Bahrain, 
Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Oman are outstanding examples 
of this fact. The White House adviser on national security 
affairs made these claims at a time when the region has been 
stockpiling destructive and complex American weapons, whose use 
is unclear even to the Arab shaykhs. 
  In the opinion of experts, the United States--by supporting 
the Zionist regime's existence and by generating tension between 
that regime and the Arab governments--intends to open up a new 
front of hostility and tension among the regional Muslim nations. 
  The prolonged visit by the U.S. assistant secretary of state 
to the Persian Gulf region, his provocative remarks regarding 
the so-called dangers from Iran, his resurrecting of the claims 
of the Untied Arab Emirates, all were part of the U.S. policy of 
generating tension in the region. 
  Some countries' endorsement of such claims against Iran is 
part of the overt U.S. policy of fomenting tension in the 
region. Unfortunately, some of these countries have fallen into 
the traps laid by the colonialists, and they are following 
precisely the same lines that the Americans have formulated to 
raise tension. 
  In this regard, in his speech yesterday, Saudi Arabian King 
Fahd called on Iran to abide by international norms and alluded 
to the UAE's territorial claims against Iran, calling for the 
handing over of the Iranian islands in the Persian Gulf to the 
UAE. 
  These remarks can only result in raising tension in the 
region, and will result in greater backwardness and misfortune 
for the region, with more domination and profit making by the 
United States. The Saudi king has thus taken a new step toward 
disrupting the sensitive situation in the Persian Gulf region.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] The foreign ministers of the Arab member countries 
of the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] finally ended 
their two days of talks in Saudi Arabia with a statement that 
gave a seal of approval and legality to dismemberment of the 
Republic of Yemen through implicit recognition of the Democratic 
Republic of Yemen. 
  This is the first foreign reaction in support of Yemen's 
dismemberment, because even though the southern leaders of Yemen 
announced their independence at the start of the civil war, no 
foreign country has yet recognized Yemen's dismemberment or 
questioned its unity. 
  The stand taken by the GCC foreign ministers in the implicit 
recognition of Yemen's dismemberment is dangerous, the 
continuation of which could have disastrous consequences for 
Yemen as well for as the Arab and Islamic worlds. Among the six 
Arab countries on the southern shores of the Persian Gulf, only 
Qatar voted against this decision, and took a unity-seeking 
stand on the developments in Yemen. 
  In their two days of talks the GCC foreign ministers not 
only 
failed to take a step toward solving the crisis of civil war in 
Yemen but worked toward continuing it. Political experts 
believe that the stand does not reflect the policies of the GCC 
countries than but rather the dangerous game that [Saudi] Arabia 
is pursuing under cover of the GCC. 
  Over and above the negative stand taken on the domestic 
crisis in Yemen, the rulers of Riyadh seek to push Yemen into an 
endless crisis and thus forever forget the issue of the three 
oil-rich provinces that have been occupied by [Saudi] Arabia for 
decades. 
  The three provinces were occupied by Saudi Arabia in the 
1930's and were supposed to be returned to Yemen after 30 years, 
in the 1960's. But due to the civil war at that time in Yemen, 
Saudi Arabia managed to delay the deadline for another 30 years. 
  Recently, with Yemen's insistence on the return of the three 
provinces, Riyadh again sought to intensify civil war and to 
delay the deadline for the return of Yemen's occupied 
territories. Political experts therefore believe that the result 
of the GCC foreign ministers meeting in Saudi Arabia was merely 
a political pretext for Saudi Arabian diplomacy. Riyadh's 
policy of causing civil war in Yemen follows the failure of 
repeated attempts by Saudi Arabian leaders to weaken united 
Yemen through transferring political, economic, and security 
crises into that country. 
  Parallel to Riyadh's efforts to perpetuate Yemen's domestic 
crisis by recognizing the Aden government in the south, Saudi 
Arabia also seeks to create and magnify a pseudo-crisis in the 
region, hoping thus to divert public opinion in the region's 
nations from their own policies of discord. 
  The plan, or to be more precise, the creation of a so-called 
issue of the three islands and efforts to create differences 
between Iran and the United Arab Emirates is also within this 
context. But this weapon is now increasingly losing its 
effectiveness with the gradual publication of legal and historic 
documents by official international sources regarding the 
sovereignty of the Islamic Republic of Iran over the islands.

  [Text] Tehran, June 4, IRNA -- The Foreign Ministry here 
today reiterated that the three Lesser and Greater Tunbs as well 
as Abu Musa Islands belonged to Iran according to the historical 
documents, and welcomed talks with United Arab Emirates (UAE) 
without any precondition. 
  Mahmud Mohammadi, a Foreign Ministry's spokesman, referred 
to 
the final communique of the (Persian) Gulf Cooperation Council 
(PGCC) Sunday night [5 June], and said the communique did not 
reportedly pass unanimously, and that all six PGCC ministers 
were not present at the time of approval. 
  However, he stressed that according to the historical 
documents the islands have always belonged to Iran, and said 
Iran has always welcomed mutual talks with UAE without any 
precondition. "The invitation for Shaykh Hamdan is still 
valid," he added. 
  Prominent university scholars in a recent seminar in Paris 
reviewed the historial documents on Iran's ownership of the 
islands. 
  On the Saudi protest to the Iranian media reports concerning 
Saudi Arabia, which had been included in the PGCC final 
communique, Mohammadi said Iranian media "are totally free". 
  "The media in Iran criticize also formal policies of the 
country most of the time, and our neighbours should understand 
this reality," he said adding "on the other hand it is natural 
that the media would react when they see the negligence of an 
agreement." 
  Mohammadi also refuted the claims of Iran's support and 
military aid to one of the warring sides in Yemen, and said Iran 
had expressed its regret over the clashes and opposed any 
military operations in Yemen. The Islamic Republic adopted an 
impartial position and announced its readiness for mediation in 
Yemen, he said. 
  More on the issue the spokesman said Iran is deeply 
interested in the integrity of the Islamic countries, whose 
disintegration, he said, are provoked by the foreigners. "We 
support the settlement of disputes in a peaceful way." 
  "We are deeply sorry for the killing of each and every 
Muslim 
whether in the north or in the south, and we invite the two 
sides to end the clashes and begin talks with the aim of 
preservation of Yemen's unity," he said. 
  Mohammadi also invited other countries to show self-restrain 
and avoid flaming the tension.

  [Text] Yesterday afternoon the Thai ambassador in Tehran 
was summoned to the Foreign ministry and handed a note of 
protest by the deputy foreign minister and head of the 
Department for Southern and Eastern Affairs. The Central News 
Unit reports this note protested the arrest of several Iranians 
on the trumped-up charges of their attempting to blow up the 
Zionist regime's embassy in Bangkok and also to related 
interviews by Thai officials. 
  In this note of protest, the Islamic Republic of Iran has 
demanded an immediate response from the Thai Government and has 
asked for documented proof of the charges brought against the 
Iranian nationals. It has also asked the Thai Government to 
arrange a meeting between officials of the Islamic Republic's 
consulate in Bangkok and the accused.

<F P=106> [Commentary from the 209th issue of KORDESTAN magazine; date </F>
not given: "Let Us Not Forget the Political Prisoners" ] 
  [Text] The inhuman crimes and acts that the Islamic 
Republic has been perpetrating against the people of our 
country, and especially against its political opponents during 
its more than 15 years of rule, have made the world realize its 
nature as a state completely against freedom. This is why not a 
year passes without the Islamic Republic being listed among the 
world's bloodthirsty and arbitrary regimes and without its being 
criticized on a world level. 
  Some of the most heart-rending crimes by this regime are 
perpetrated against combatants who disagree with the clergymen 
and are opponents of the regime. During the 15 years of the 
regime's existence, hundreds of Iranian citizens have been 
thrown into the torture chambers of the Islamic Republic because 
of their political beliefs and have received long prison terms, 
while thousands have received the death penalty. 
  Here we do not intend to refer to all these crimes and to 
the 
inhuman acts that have become ordinary in the dungeons of the 
Islamic Republic. These crimes have been revealed on many 
occasions. Revelations have been made of heart-rending acts 
such as the mass murder of political prisoners, extortion, 
depriving them of the right to a lawyer, summary trials, rape of 
girls before their execution, dozens of kinds of psychological 
and physical tortures, and leaving the world uninformed of the 
situation of the political prisoners and so on by presenting no 
documentary proof. Actually very few are unaware that all types 
of crimes have been perpetrated in clerical Iran against 
political prisoners. Thus, in this article we intend to only 
list the duties that the families and relatives of the political 
prisoners, our country's masses, opposition parties and 
organizations, and world humanitarian groups and organizations 
have toward these political prisoners. 
  If we accept the fact that the struggle against dictatorship 
and strangulation is a holy mission--and we do--and if we 
believe in the fact that the Islamic Republic is the 
full-fledged enemy of human rights and freedoms and the 
strangler of these rights and freedoms--and we do--both we, 
those who live in Iran and face the bullying and arbitrariness 
of the clerical regime, and the humanitarian circles and 
organizations and, in general, progressive humanity, the human 
values and criteria of which the Islamic Republic is ridiculing, 
we will have certain duties to perform as far as the political 
prisoners in Iran are concerned. 
  We would first like to list the duties of the families and 
relatives of the political prisoners. We know that for some 
time now the clerical regime has wanted to pretend that there is 
no such thing as a political prisoner in Iran and that the 
combatants who are under arrest have been cast into prison on 
charges of ordinary crimes. For this reason, the relatives and 
families of the political prisoners should use every possible 
means to contact opposition organizations and to give them any 
information that they have on their dear imprisoned ones such as 
their name, age, educational background, profession, political 
activities and stands, the date and place of their arrest, and 
whatever they know about their trial. They should try to hand 
over the necessary information and documents on their imprisoned 
relative to representatives of the Human Rights Commission and 
Amnesty International when they visit Iran. If possible, they 
should make their voices heard by the foreign mass media and by 
those humanitarian organizations and groups that are ready to 
reveal the crimes perpetrated by the Iranian rulers. 
  Many of these duties do not concern only the families and 
relatives of the political prisoners. Each and every 
respectable and sensitive person should consider himself a 
next-of-kin of the political prisoners and to consider it his 
duty to inform the people and political forces of Iran, as well 
as the world, of the situation the imprisoned freedom-lovers are 
in. The duty that our country's masses have in relation with 
this is even heavier. While revealing these crimes and giving 
the necessary information to the competent circles, they should 
also be active in another field. They should become a backbone 
and a mouthpiece for those families who are facing numerous 
psychological and material problems because their daughter, son, 
or the head of the family has been arrested. The more the masses 
sympathize with the families of the political prisoners and 
strive to remove their problems, the more they will be resisting 
the executioners and the prouder they will defend their demands 
which are the demands of the majority of the people in our 
country as well. 
  A political prisoner should feel that if he has welcomed 
torture and death for the sake of fulfilling the demands and the 
freedoms of the people of the country, the people too are 
appreciative, and they are not indifferent toward their families 
and their sacrifices. More important yet, our compatriots should 
organize protest movements related to the political prisoners 
and demand that the regime end their behind-the-scene trials, 
publish the number of political prisoners and a report on the 
true situation of the prisoners, allow political prisoners to 
meet with their families and relatives on a regular basis, 
provide suitable health and food facilities, and allow them 
access to radios and newspapers, and the books that they wish to 
read. All the staged acts that the Islamic Republic of Iran is 
carrying out in connection with the political prisoners should 
be neutralized, and especially when representatives of 
organizations defending human rights come to Iran to assess the 
situation of human rights, our compatriots should try to 
organize antiregime protests and to inform these representatives 
of the dire situation that the political prisoners in Iran are 
facing. 
  Iran's political forces that are engaged in a struggle 
against the regime should inform world public opinion of all the 
documents and information that they acquire through their 
members and supporters and through the people of our country in 
connection with the political prisoners. Many of these forces 
have some sort of propaganda means such as radio stations, 
newspapers, and so on. Therefore, while publishing such 
information and documentation, they should pay more attention to 
directing and encouraging the masses of our country and to 
further informing them of the duties that they have toward the 
political prisoners. 
  During the past few years, all the antiregime forces have 
strived to inform the world abroad of the situation of the 
political prisoners in Iran. Undoubtedly, if there is more 
cooperation and coordination among the opposition organizations 
and personalities and if a common plan is laid out, their 
efforts and the activities in this field will be more widely 
reflected and there will be more solidarity than is seen on the 
global level today. 
  Until now, Amnesty International, the Middle East Watch, the 
Human Rights Commission, the UN General Assembly, and many other 
world pro-human rights groups and organizations have revealed 
the unprecedented crimes that the Islamic Republic of Iran has 
perpetrated and is perpetrating against the political prisoners. 
But the repeated condemnation of the Islamic Republic by these 
organizations and groups has not put an end to the massacre of 
political prisoners in Iran or, at least, helped to bring about 
a major development in relation to them. One of the reasons for 
this is that the governments of the world have not attached 
great importance to the views and stands of pro-human rights 
organizations on the Islamic Republic and, ignoring the 
antipopular nature of this regime, they have continued their 
political-economic relations and cooperation with the Islamic 
Republic. 
  It is by taking these facts into consideration that 
pro-human 
rights organizations and all sources, forces, and personalities 
who consider their struggle against the massacre of 
freedom-seekers in Iran to be their humanitarian duty should 
mobilize world public opinion and place governments under 
pressure to stop transactions and cooperation with the Islamic 
Republic, and to isolate this regime in the world on charges of 
fighting against freedom and crushing freedom-lovers. 
  We hope that everyone will help to serve the political 
prisoners of Iran.

<F P=106> ["Weekly Political Newsletter" by Dr. Mohammad Javad </F>
Larijani, Tehran Majles deputy and member of the Supreme 
National Security Council: "Occupied Palestine and the Middle 
East Situation"] 
  [Text] 1. It is possible that the situation in occupied 
Palestine may appear rather erratic: On the one hand, the 
people in Gaza and Jericho celebrated the departure of the 
Zionist soldiers and on the other hand one of the most intense 
armed clashes took place between the Palestinian combatants and 
the Israelis in al-Khalil [Hebron]. 
  Is there a dichotomy among the Palestinians? Does this mean 
that there is one group that is in favor of jihad against the 
Zionist regime and another that is seeking a normal life--even 
though vicarious--on the sidelines of this regime? We should 
view the issue in a more comprehensive manner. What will the 
changes in the Palestinian movement be, the political role of 
the Middle East and even of the regions beyond it in light of 
current political moves in the region in which the United 
States, Israel and the West have used all their weight? 
  2. The motives behind the moves of the United States and 
Israel with regard to the Palestinian movement and the intifadah 
are quite clear. They obviously want them to be snuffed out as 
soon as possible. Military pressure has not yielded any results 
and efforts to sow political discord have also not been able to 
drive a wedge in the ranks. The only hope that is left for them 
is that the intifadah should be contained within narrow 
geographical confines and should be pitted against 'Arafat's 
forces. 'Arafat should be given serious support (military, 
political, financial, and propagandistic) and what the Zionist 
regime was unable to achieve, should be done by 'Arafat. What 
should the Islamic movement do in such circumstances? 
  In my opinion, the current dual policy is the best one! In 
Gaza and Jericho, the Islamic movement should not become 
embroiled with pro-'Arafat forces who until yesterday were among 
the ranks of the intifadah. They should be strongly inducted 
into the management! Outside the confines of the autonomous 
region, the intifadah should continue with all its strength. 
There is no doubt that 'Arafat and Israel are apprehensive of 
any kind of victory of the Islamic forces in all kinds of 
elections and their effective participation in the management. 
Some reports indicate that Israel prefers that 'Arafat 
personally be in charge of administrative affairs for some time, 
and that there be no elections. 
  In either case, the path will be opened for the victory of 
the Muslims, that is, if there are elections and they win or if 
there is a dictatorship and 'Arafat's supporters stand behind 
him. 'Arafat will be forced to ask the Israelis for assistance 
once again for his own perpetuation and the extent of the 
intifadah will continue in its own sphere of action! 
  3. Worry with regard to the assessments that I have 
mentioned above have motivated the United States and Israel to 
pay attention to the role of the Islamic Republic of Iran as 
regards the course of the intifadah and they are exceedingly 
afraid of the spiritual and political effect of our stances. 
The strong stance of the U.S. secretary of state during his 
address to a gathering of Jews in New York is a clear indication 
of this fear. 
  Thus, the fabrication of a new preoccupation with regard to 
Iran has been placed on the agenda. Perhaps the most 
appropriate pretext and in fact, one on which they would have 
greater control would be some Arab countries in the Persian 
Gulf. An important point that merits the attention of the 
officials of Islamic Iran and the regional governments is: Our 
friends in the littoral states of the southern Persian Gulf 
should know that the United States does not have the ability to 
bring about a change of regime in Baghdad! The United States 
has extracted an exorbitant price for this promise so far. 
Therefore, it is seeking to clear its ledger, in practice, by 
its propaganda of a stronger threat, such as Iran. Right from 
the outset, it was clear that the United States did not have the 
ability to fulfill its promise, as Iraq is not a Panama or a 
Grenada! Even if it were, it would not have been to the benefit 
of the region that the door be opened to such intervention by 
the United States. This means that the sole path that remains 
for maintaining stability and peace in the Persian Gulf region 
is collective cooperation among the regional countries and that 
is all! 
  4. The Washington echelons have recently broken a world 
record in tactlessness: Their policy from the PRC, Japan, all 
the way to the Middle East and Iran is characterized by an 
egocentricity and stupidity which is the best way to describe 
their stances and behavior. 
  In such circumstances, our foreign policy should be based 
entirely on the main axes of our national interests with extreme 
poise and we should refrain from getting involved in 
controversial and marginal issues, regardless of whether these 
controversial issues pertain to any links with the IRA or are 
provocations in the form of awarding literary prizes to Salman 
Rushdie. 
  We have a momentous task ahead of us: To support the great 
Islamic renaissance [preceding word in French] and to prove that 
in today's world, we can transform our Islamic country into a 
modern and advanced country. Every step that we take forward 
toward the attainment of this objective is the biggest slap in 
the face of the enemies of dear Iran, proud Islam, and the great 
movement that our nation has brought about in the Islamic world.

  [Text] Athens, June 4, IRNA -- The 12-member European Union 
(EU) and the Islamic Republic of Iran have decided to continue 
their dialogue to promote and widen relations following talks 
between EU and Iranian officials in Athens Friday. 
  "We have decided to continue our discussion and exchange of 
views on various issues of mutual interest," 'Ali Ahani, 
director general for West European affairs at Iran's foreign 
ministry, told IRNA in an interview Saturday. 
  It was the third round of meeting between Iran and the EU. 
The first two rounds were held in Copenhagen and Brussels. 
  The Iranain delegation, led by deputy foreign minister for 
Euro-American affairs Mahmoud Va'ezi and the EU troika, headed 
by Greek Foreign Under Secretary George Papandreou, held 
marathon 3-hour talks yesterday. 
  The EU troika consists of the former, the current and the 
forthcoming holder of the rotating EU presidency, namely 
Belgium, Greece and Germany. 
  "We have very good relations with all the EU countries, in 
economic, political and cultural fields. But we should try to 
have the same level of cooperation with the EU in its totality," 
said Ahani. 
  Asked to comment on the recent expulsion of an Iranain 
diplomat from London and a British diplomat from Tehran, Ahani 
said he hoped the matter has now closed and there would be no 
further expulsions. 
  "I hope it will be stopped. We don't want to have tension in 
relations with any EU member," he said. The tensions were 
created by the British side, Ahani added. 
  The Iranian delegation left Athens Saturday after a 2-day 
visit during which they met Greek government officials and 
discussed bilateral political, economic and cultural ties. 
  Va'ezi was received by Greek Prime Minister Andreas 
Papandreau, the current euprht welcomed the expansion of 
Athens-Tehran ties and also Iran's relations with the EU. 
  Ahani said Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias will be 
visiting Tehran next week to continue discussions on bilateral 
relations and on regional and international issues. 
  Pointing that Greece currently holds the EU Presidency, 
Ahani 
said the Greek Minister's visit will offer an important 
opportunity to discuss the situation in the Persian Gulf region, 
the Balkans And europe. 
  Ahani described Greek-Iranian relations as "excellent."

  [Text] Larnaca, 10 Ordibehesht [30 April] IRNA -- Last 
Wednesday the Cyprus Government expelled 30 Iranians, several of 
whom had just arrived at Larnaca Airport the same day. 
  One of the expelled Iranians, Reza Payami, said: The reason 
for expelling this group still has not been announced by the 
Cyprus police. 
  He said their expulsion was likely related to a theft that 
took place two weeks ago at a household appliances store. 
  Another of the individuals expelled said without giving his 
name: I was arrested by the Larnaca police as soon as I reached 
the airport. 
  He also claimed that the airport police tried in various 
ways 
to take the $1,800 he had away from him. 
  He said that he was forced to sell some of his household 
furnishings to make his trip to Cyprus possible. 
  A number of these expelled Iranians, citing deception or 
extortion of Iranians seeking work in Cyprus, asked Iran's 
embassies to cooperate with Iranians seeking work in various 
countries.

  [Text] Tehran, 10 Ordibehesht [30 April] KEYHAN-E HAVA'I 
News Service -- Following the dissolution of the apartheid 
regime and the participation of all races in the national 
elections in South Africa, Iran's political and economic 
relations with this country, which were cut off in 1980 after 
the triumph of the Islamic revolution of Iran, were resumed. 
  The Iranian Government, which sent four delegates to 
supervise the national elections in South Africa, is waiting for 
the announcement of the results of the South African elections, 
in order on that basis to organize relations with the next 
government in Pretoria. 
  Iran's political relations began with South Africa in 1349 
[21 March 1970-20 March 1971]. In that year the governments at 
that time in Iran and South Africa opened consulates in 
Johannesburg and Tehran. Following that, economic relations 
between the two countries also developed to the extent that 90 
percent of the Pretoria regime's oil needs were met by Iran. 
Several years later, with the participation of the Iran National 
Oil Company, construction began on the [?Natruf] refinery in 
South Africa. In addition to its participation in the 
construction of this refinery, at the outset Iran also owned 
17.5 percent of its shares. The remainder of the refinery's 
shares were owned by the French [?Gugal] company, with 30 
percent, and the South African SASOL [South African Coal, Oil 
and Gas Corporation] company, with 52.5 percent. 
  In the beginning this refinery's capacity was 50,000 barrels 
per day, and after a time it increased to 78,000 barrels. Thus 
Iran's shares in the Natruf refinery in 1974 increased from 17.5 
percent to 33.3 percent of the entire refinery. 
  Based on a separate contract signed between the Iran 
National 
Oil Company and South African officials, the Iranian side was 
required to supply 70 percent of the oil needed by the Natruf. 
Based on this contract, Iran was required to deliver 25 million 
tons of crude oil to South Africa over a 15-year period. By the 
time of the triumph of the Islamic revolution, 12 million tons 
of crude oil had been delivered to this country. 
  In an interview with KEYHAN-E HAVA'I, an expert on foreign 
affairs discussed the fall of the apartheid regime in South 
Africa. He said: Since the Natruf Oil Refinery was designed 
based on the characteristics of Iran's oil and Iran cut off its 
oil exports to South Africa after the triumph of the Islamic 
revolution, the Natruf Refinery suffered losses that were such 
that several years later the Government of Iran sold its shares 
to the South African SASOL company to recover its losses and 
prevent further losses. Nevertheless, if the South African 
elections produce a democratic government, the Iranian 
Government can resume its relations with this country. 
  These experts added: In addition, the former Iranian 
regime's 
oil cooperation with the apartheid government and South Africa 
made Iran the Pretoria regime's second-largest trading partner 
after Israel. 
  The governments of the time in Iran and South Africa 
cooperated on mining matters and in the extraction of uranium. 
Likewise, companies affiliated with the private sector in the 
two countries were active importing and exporting and selling 
Iran's dried fruits and South Africa's industrial materials.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Here Comes Tagging"] </F>
  [Text] The costly war with Iraq is primarily responsible 
for our chronic economic difficulties. No right-thinking 
Iranian had expected life to be comfortable after the guns fell 
silent in 1988. The common masses, who are the supporters of the 
Islamic Revolution and sacrificed their near and dear ones in 
the 8-year-old war, knew that the post-war era would be 
problematic. 
  As is the case in such circumstances, the poor and middle 
class are always called on to make concessions. They have been 
ready to do their share every time and in many instances, much 
more than would be normally expected of them. 
  Speaking strictly of the economic health of the majority of 
our people, almost six years after Iraq's military aggressions 
ended we can at best say the situation has been deteriorating. 
To say the least the government of President Akbar 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani seems to have entirely put the fate of the 
economy in the hands of `market forces'. Our economic planners 
have generally been unsuccessful and this bitter reality is 
clearly visible in the market itself. 
  Prices of goods and services have jumped to between 50 to 
250 
percent in the past few months. Chaos rules supreme in the 
bazaars to the extent that the business community refuses to 
acknowledge even the basic principles of trade not to mention 
the frontiers of human relations, ethics and respect for the 
rule of law. One lady shopper says of the retailers and 
shop-owners "they have full freedom to raise prices". In an 
area of a few hundred meters, prices differ as much as 20 to 30 
percent `depending on the conscience and justice' of the seller. 
  For years, we have heard our statesmen talk about the need 
to 
build a society on the foundation of social justice and economic 
morals. There is no death of seminars, conferences and 
gatherings where economic and social planners stick to the 
rhetoric of directing and sustaining our Muslim society, free 
from discrimination and injustice. But, whether we like it or 
not, the fundamental truth is that rhetoric has far outstripped 
reality. People with fixed incomes are doomed as their 
purchasing power declines every day and along with it their 
morale and tolerance. 
  This week the minister of commerce announced that it is 
compulsory to put price tags on commodities. It's a too little 
and too late a move. As far as our information goes, this 
measures also does not carry enough weight and was reportedly 
not coordinated with other related institutions and ministries. 
The tagging is no relief at all. Experience teaches us that 
this move is yet another gimmick to `stabilize the market', will 
have the same fate as hundreds of its predecessors. 
  Looking at the way ministries have functioned in the recent 
past, observers feel the government is equally to be blamed for 
the frightening confusion, as the middlemen and opportunists. 
They believe the government has exacerbated the already high 
inflation rate and slow economic growth--all of which have 
worsened the country's socio-economic problems and eroded the 
financial stability of the middle class. 
  Then there is the dollar disease. Everything from pin to 
plane is calculated on the `$ price'. Education, housing and 
medical services are gradually getting out of reach for the 
ordinary working class, as our policymakers are increasingly 
forgetting that these three basics are rights and not privileges. 
  We are always given sermons about falling revenues due to 
the 
drop in oil prices. Of course the oil argument cannot be 
regarded as total nonsense. No doubt that too is a factor, but 
let's not forget that all developing countries do not survive on 
oil. They select and elect the right people for key positions. 
Honesty, efficiency and merit are the criteria of appointments 
in majority of the states if not all. Thank God, most of our 
officials are certainly honest and God-fearing persons and some 
are competent too. In view of the current socio-economic 
problems in the country effective action should be taken to find 
similar people for the middle and lower ranking government 
positions also. 
  Nevertheless the people would like to see what the Commerce 
Ministry's tagging will bring in its wake. It has become 
apparent that the government's influence in maintaining economic 
order is slight to almost non-existent.

  [Text] Concurrent with the unprecedented intensification of 
the economic and social crisis in the country and increasing 
mass protests by an exasperated public, reports have been 
received of the spread of student strikes. 
  Following the student strike at Martyr Beheshti University 
in 
Tehran (formerly the National University), which began as a 
strike by women students against the unworkable situation at the 
student dormitories and quickly spread throughout the 
university, the strike continued for a week with a demand for 
the firing of the university management. 
  Based on this report, whose details are still unclear, 500 
accounting students at Tehran's 'Alameh Tabataba'i University 
staged a strike on 7 and 8 Esfand last year [26-27 February 
1994] demanding the firing of the university president. 
Likewise, officials at Qom's Fatemieh University closed the 
academic term in the face of an extensive student strike against 
this university's excessive tuition increase. 
  The leaders of the regime of the "vice regency of the chief 
jurisconsult," who remember well the experience of the student 
strikes of the years 1355-56 [21 March 1976-20 March 1978] and 
their connection with a mass movement during the Bahman [21 
January-19 February] revolution, have undertaken a terrified 
search for a solution, believing that by "dealing" with some of 
the class demands of the students they will prevent the student 
movement from spreading and becoming a national political 
movement. In this regard, in a note in the budget passed for 
1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995], the Majles has required the 
Central Bank to "provide the relevant universities with 10 
billion tumans through the banking system in the form of 
interest-free or participatory loans and other devices to 
complete and build student dormitories."

  [Text] Among its reactions, Algeria has welcomed with 
satisfaction the Yemeni Government's decision to accept the 
cease-fire beginning at midnight tonight. In a statement by the 
official spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Algeria 
welcomed the Yemeni Government's decision and expressed the hope 
that the Yemeni brothers would immediately begin a dialogue and 
lay the foundations of a just and permanent settlement to the 
conflict based on the protection of the Yemeni people's higher 
interests. 
  The statement added that Algeria, in the words of head of 
state Liamine Zeroual, had repeatedly warned the Yemeni brothers 
of the great risks of the conflict to Yemen. The head of state 
had insistently indicated the need for dialogue and consultation 
to prevail in the confrontation, especially when he received the 
two special Yemeni envoys and in the greetings message that he 
sent to the leaders of that country on the occasion of the 
Yemeni national day. 
  Within this context, Algeria renews its desire and readiness 
to offer its cooperation and that of the AMU [Arab Maghreb 
Union]--of which Algeria currently holds the presidency--with 
the aim of putting an end to this bloody struggle.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by Foreign Ministry to INA] </F>
  [Excerpts] Baghdad, 6 Jun (INA) -- The rebellious, 
separatist clique in Yemen has claimed that it has detained five 
Iraqi soldiers who were participating with the legitimate Yemeni 
forces in battles against the separatists. Reporting this 
allegation, the Saudi MBC television showed pictures of five 
Iraqi citizens, claiming that they were soldiers seized by the 
separatists in Yemen. 
  The Iraqi Foreign Ministry stresses that the five Iraqi 
citizens whose pictures appeared on the screen of Saudi MBC 
television as Iraqi soldiers are in fact civilian employees 
working under contract with the Yemeni Government. [passage 
omitted] 
  The Foreign Ministry spokesman said: By resorting to such 
fabrications and misleading reports, the gang of separatists in 
Yemen attempts to conceal suspect and dishonest objectives 
through which it tries to instigate certain parties against the 
legitimate authorities in Yemen and to harm Iraq. The documents 
kept by the Iraqi Foreign Ministry concerning the five Iraqi 
citizens -- job contracts and passports -- categorically refute 
the separatists' allegations. 
  Noting those facts and expressing readiness to give public 
and mass media access to those documents, the Iraqi Foreign 
Ministry appeals to the news media which have reported those 
allegations to be accurate and to refute, on the basis of those 
facts and documents, the separatists' lies and allegations. 
This is especially since the allegations are not the first 
attempt to mislead and deceive public opinion into believing 
that there are Iraqis fighting by the side of the legitimate 
Yemeni forces. 
  Holding the separatists responsible for the safety of those 
Iraqi citizens and their property, families, and rights, Iraq 
demands that they be released so that they can leave Yemen for 
Iraq. Reiterating its denial of those cheap, unfounded 
allegations which are refuted by categorical evidence, Iraq 
reaffirms its support for the unity of fraternal Yemen and its 
support for the legitimate, legal, and constitutional authority 
represented by the leadership of unified Yemen under President 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. Iraq also condemns that treacherous crime 
of secession.

  [Text] London, June 6, IRNA -- Hezb ut-Tahrir says that it 
is inviting Muslims from around the world to a conference in 
London to prepare the ground for the setting up of an Islamic 
state in a Middle East country, yet to be identified. 
  The radical group is totally non-committal about its 
organization or where it gets its claimed support that are said 
to number some 2,000 members in Britain and unknown quantity in 
other countries, which it is equally vague about. 
  Instead it speaks in terms of an estimated 12,000 Muslims 
from around the world hopefully attending its conference at 
Wembley arena on August 7 to discuss the past, present and 
future of Islam. 
  Hezb ut-Tahrir was originally established in 1952, but has 
been a largely dormant group until recent years, when it has set 
up its stall as a radical Muslim group "differing from all 
others." It also claims not to recognize any Islamic sects. 
  The shadowy organization is particularly tight-lipped about 
where it gains its funds from for its campaigning, which is 
rated as one of the most active on British university campuses. 
  Its main objective has been to feed on Muslim youths, 
alienated from Britain's secular society, by appealing for a 
radical agenda in high emotive terms but without any definite 
aims. 
  The increasing public profile given to Hezb ut-Tahrir comes 
at a time of a huge growth in Islamic splinter groups in 
Britain, each with their own seeming agenda to defeat efforts 
for a collective voice for Britain's 1.5 million Muslim 
community. 
  The group in London is led by Omar Bakri Mohammad, a Saudi 
Arabian, who receives his orders from Abdul Qadim al-Jlum of 
unknown origins but who is said to be "somewhere in the Middle 
East." 
  While the organization is discreet about its funding, it is 
thought to have been revitalized to try to counter support for 
the Islamic movement taking its lead from the Islamic revolution 
in Iran, which it says it does not accept. 
  Its contention, claimed to be "purely ideological," is that 
it wishes to bring down all Arab regimes to enact what appear to 
be a "hidden agenda" which its members are reluctant to spell 
out. 
  The main publicity for Hezb ut-Tahrir has come from the 
Zionist press, which has voiced regular fears about its claimed 
calls for the killing of Jews that have been strenuously denied 
along with its often out-of-context quotations from the holy 
Quran.

  [Text] Damascus -- Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad has 
received a message from Iranian President 'Ali Akbar 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani stressing Iran's support for Syria in the 
event of any aggression on it following recent Israeli raids on 
Lebanon and the escalation in the military situation. 
  Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati delivered the 
message to President al-Asad during their meeting in Damascus 
yesterday. The objective of his visit is to hold talks with 
senior Syrian officials on conditions in the region, especially 
the military deterioration in Lebanon and Israel's recent 
aggression on Hizballah's base in the Lebanese al-Biqa'. 
  Upon his arrival in the Iranian Embassy in Damascus Velayati 
met with a Hizballah delegation led by Secretary General Hasan 
Nasrallah. They discussed developments in the situation in 
Lebanon in the light of the continued Israeli attacks. Velayati 
stressed Iran's absolute support for the Lebanese resistance 
against the Israeli occupation. 
  Iranian sources in Damascus have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that 
the Hizballah secretary general held talks with some senior 
Syrian officials on conditions and coordinating positions with 
Syria.

  [Text] AL-MAJD has learned that President Yasir 'Arafat's 
state of health is not reassuring. He is suffering from 
irregular heartbeats, fever, and acute influenza, in addition to 
a deteriorating morale and nervous system. 
  Reliable sources told AL-MAJD that 'Arafat's health is more 
serious than declared and that his aides are extremely worried 
about his health although they downplay the seriousness of his 
illness in their public statements. 
  'Arafat's entourage was split over his treatment. One team 
proposed transferring him to the al-Husayn Medical Center [in 
Amman]. Another team proposed summoning a French medical team 
to treat 'Arafat in Tunis and thus keep his critical health 
condition a secret. 
  'Arafat, weakened by the plane crash in the Libyan desert, 
has recently been exposed to many psychological and political 
pressures which exacerbated his health condition and greatly 
sapped his strength. 
  One of his aides told AL-MAJD that 'Arafat's fear of the 
self-rule experiment, the opposition forces' firm refusal to 
participate in the National Authority, and the failure of 
Europe, America, and Japan to provide him with the promised 
billions, in addition to the abstention of many personalities 
from supporting him and sharing power with him, have made him 
susceptible to anxiety, sleeplessness, constant tension, and 
loss of balance and concentration. The close aide added: What 
can Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] do when he finds that his closest 
companions like Faruq Qaddumi, Khalid al-Hasan, and Muhammad 
Jihad have disappointed and abandoned him? They object to his 
plans and refuse to accept any post he is proposing to them. 
  Concluding, the aide said with a sigh: "I am afraid that 
Abu-'Ammar's proponents and opponents have started to think of 
the stage after him and of the need to fill the leadership 
vacuum expected after his departure."

  [Text] Tunis, 7 Jun (MENA) -- Informed Palestinian sources 
have stated that PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat intends to return to 
Jericho and Gaza in July leading the Palestinian leadership and 
PLO institutions. 
  The sources stressed that a final and definitive date for 
'Arafat's return has not been set despite much talk about 
unrealistic dates. They say the return is likely to be in July 
so that it will precede the dates of municipal and legislative 
elections and they note that the elections, due for October, are 
inconceivable in the absence of 'Arafat and PLO institutions and 
agencies connected with the election campaign. 
  The sources said 'Arafat will return to Gaza and Jericho 
accompanied by 400 high-ranking leaders and agencies associated 
with the daily routine who have not been separated from 'Arafat 
for a quarter of a century.

  [Text] Islamabad, May 29: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has 
said that the government will impose new taxes of about Rs 15 
billion in the forthcoming budget. 
  Speaking at a Press conference in her chamber on Sunday, Ms 
Bhutto said the forthcoming budget would be a realistic one, but 
said the government would have to impose taxes owing to the ill- 
conceived policies and economic mismanagement of the previous 
government. 
  She said the budget would be tough because of variety of 
reasons. She pointed out that salaries had not been increased 
for the last three years and the government would have to take 
budgetary measures to increase salaries and provide relief to 
the people. 
  Dilating on the country's economic situation she said the 
yawning gap hetween the income and expenditures was not because 
of the present people's government. She pointed out that loans 
taken by the previous government of Nawaz Sharif exceeded the 
sun of loans taken by all the governments since 1947. 
  "The government had the option either to meet the budget 
deficit through more borrowings or imposing taxes," she said. 
She said the people's government while departing from the 
policies of previous governments decided to take a tough 
decision of introducing new taxes and help recover the ailing 
economy. 
  She claimed that the budget deficit during the previous 
Nawaz 
government rose from 6 per cent of GDP to over 8 per cent of 
GDP. It is likely to cross 9 per cent of the GDP in the coming 
June, she said. The present government has arrested the 
increasing deficit and was taking every possible step to bring 
it back to 6 per cent, she added. 
  The previous government, she maintained, spent over 80 
million dollars on the yellow cab scheme and stopped the Hub 
power project which was initiated in the previous PPP 
government. She said it resulted in severe energy crisis in the 
country which again reflected on the country's production and 
further aggravation of economic situation. 
  Giving yet another reason for the government decision to 
impose taxes, she said the government was introducing structural 
reforms and tariffs. She pointed out that tariffs had already 
been brought down from 150 per cent to 100 per cent and intended 
to further reduce these. The shortfall because of the reduction 
in tariffs should also have to make up from other taxes, she 
added. 
  However, she said the decrease in the tariffs would help 
accelerate pace of industrialisation in the country, which would 
not only provide employment but also improve the overall 
economic situation. 
  Expressing determination to eliminate unemployment from the 
country, she said "we do not want to betray the people or want 
to buy time." 
  I do not believe in making cosmetic changes," she said. 
  Responding to a question about general sales tax in context 
with the Afghan transit facility, she said the government was 
fully alive of the situation and would certainly address to the 
problem. She agreed that Afghan transit facility was being 
abused and in the present situation without reviewing the Afghan 
transit facility imposition of general sales tax would 
strengthen the black economy. She, however, refused to disclose 
the details of measures the government intended to take in this 
behalf, and said the government wanted to force the black 
economy to join into the mainstream economy. 
  Further criticising the policies of previous government she 
said they cut the budget of education women development, energy 
and other important social sectors just for the sake of laying a 
lavish motorway. 
  Enumerating the steps taken by the present government during 
the past six months, she said it was highly unjustified to say 
that we had taken no steps for the socioeconomic uplift of the 
people. 
  "We introduced agriculture tax, enacted anti-drug laws, set 
up women police station, launched anti-polio and population 
planning campaign," she said while adding that the economic 
measures taken by the present government would bear fruit before 
the next elections. 
  Replying to another question about the increase in the ghee 
prices, she said she had already issued directives to all the 
provincial chief secretaries to launch anti-hoarders campaign. 
She said the ghee prices were increased because of the slackness 
of provincial administrations and not because of the government. 
  She pointed out that the Ghee Corporation of Pakistan was 
marketing ghee at much less prices than private ghee units. She 
said the government was hiring a consultancy firm to suggest 
measures for checking monopoly of the private sector and 
regulate prices.

<F P=106> [By Maher Chmaytelli] </F>
  [Excerpt] Aden, Yemen, June 7 (AFP) -- Artillery duels 
erupted between Yemen's northern and southern forces and shells 
rained down on Aden airport Tuesday [7 June] as fighting 
shattered a ceasefire only six hours after it came into force. 
  The truce, declared unilaterally by President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih's government in the capital Sanaa, had come into effect at 
midnight (2100 GMT) but firing had gone on unabated right up to 
the deadline. 
  Salih forces and those of the southern breakaway state 
declared by 'Ali Salim al-Bid began shelling each other at 6:00 
a.m. (0300 GMT) on a battle front just 20 kilometres (12 miles) 
from this city. 
  The collapse of the ceasefire was followed by an intense 
artillery bombardment of the area around the airport, which the 
northerners have been targeting to destroy it as a base for 
southern planes. 
  But southern fighter-bombers were still taking off on combat 
missions, as a military spokesman accused Salih's troops of 
launching a widespread offensive on all fronts. 
  He said the onslaught had begun at midnight "the very moment 
he (Salih) was announcing to the world he had declared a 
ceasefire." 
  The northerners were "lying" and had dispatched columns of 
tanks to several of the war fronts shortly after the truce was 
announced, he charged. 
  The breakaway southern state was still committed to the 
ceasefire: "all we are doing is defending ourselves and 
repulsing the northern offensive," he said. 
  As the ceasefire collapsed, Sanaa Radio broadcast messages 
to 
the population of Aden saying "the hour of liberation has come." 
  The United Nations Security Council called on June 1 for an 
immediate ceasefire in the civil war which erupted on May 5 
between north and south, four years after they were unified. 
The former South Yemen proclaimed itself independent again on 
May 21. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Aden, Yemen, June 7 (AFP) -- Northern Yemeni 
troops advanced closer to the south's bastion of Aden in a snap 
offensive on Tuesday [7 June] and four people died and more than 
40 were wounded in shelling as a ceasefire collapsed, 
correspondents reported. 
  Northern forces loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
captured the Sabr village 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of Aden 
in a push which took them several kilometres (miles) closer to 
the city, an AFP correspondent witnessed at the front line. 
  Southern Lieutenant Muhammad Husayn accused the Sanaa 
authorities of using the ceasefire, announced unilaterally by 
Salih's government late Monday, to mass troops and tanks in 
preparation for the dawn advance. 
  There were heavy artillery exchanges as southern forces 
tried 
to halt the northern tank offensive. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F>
Hayim Zissowitz; place not given -- live] 
  [Text] [Zissowitz] Good morning, Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres. 
  [Peres] Good morning. 
  [Zissowitz] Why did you conceal the existence of this 
letter? 
  [Peres] Excuse me, why do you say that I concealed anything? 
  [Zissowitz] In any event, you did not reveal it. 
  [Peres] Excuse me, I would like to explain things first. In 
a speech in Johannesburg, 'Arafat said he had received a letter 
from us in Cairo containing a commitment regarding Jerusalem. 
Utter nonsense! To begin with, he did not receive any letter 
from us in Cairo with regard to Jerusalem. What is more, he did 
not receive any letter whatsoever from us. 
  Second, the letter was sent to Norwegian Foreign Minister 
Holst after the agreement was signed, and, in my opinion, its 
contents are identical to what I said in the Knesset. In my 
opinion, this is an attempt to concoct a totally unfounded 
slander. I would like to read to you an excerpt of my remarks 
in the Knesset: to uphold its cultural heritage and its social, 
religious, and other institutions -- that is what I said in the 
Knesset. I also said that coexistence in Jerusalem is a matter 
of mutual respect between all the residents and the normal 
functioning of the relevant institutions and systems -- I repeat 
-- the relevant institutions and systems. My letter does not 
contain any commitment regarding Orient House or any PLO 
institutions. The papers write that Peres agreed to Orient 
House. Where did I agree to Orient House? If Orient House 
existed during the Likud's tenure and it is legal, then this can 
be put in writing. If it is illegal, then it can be closed down 
today. This entire attempt to slander and attribute things that 
are totally unfounded.... [pauses] The truth is that Holst was 
involved in the negotiations. I think that what we did this 
year on the issue of Jerusalem is unprecedented in the history 
of the State of Israel. On the one hand, we reached an 
agreement....[pauses] One must look at the whole picture. 
Again, what we are witnessing here borders on character 
assassination. 
  [Zissowitz] Perhaps this could have been averted if you had 
made the letter public, perhaps.... 
  [Peres, interrupting] Excuse me, hold on a second. We 
reached an agreement this year with the Vatican in Jerusalem -- 
in Jerusalem as it is: united, under Israeli sovereignty. This 
year, for the first time, we set Jerusalem aside from the 
autonomy. True, we promised to uphold the status quo, but the 
status quo existed even without the letter. 
  [Zissowitz] With your permission, Mr. Foreign Minister, we 
will soon touch upon the status of Jerusalem and your position 
on the issue, but first I would like to ask you: Why did you 
fail to make the existence of the letter public for eight 
months, even after Yasir 'Arafat announced the existence of such 
a letter? 
  [Peres] I may have been wrong from a journalistic point of 
view, but I do not act according to journalistic considerations 
alone. I cannot start making public correspondence with fellow 
ministers without asking them first.... 
  [Zissowitz, interrupting] But you wrote the letter. 
  [Peres] Wait a minute; you asked me a question, and I will 
answer you. I returned to Israel the evening of Friday, 3 June, 
shortly before the beginning of the Sabbath. The issue began 
unfolding on Saturday, and I had been abroad for two weeks. 
Sunday is a day off abroad, and on Monday I coordinated matters 
with the person I thought I should. I had no reason to conceal 
the letter. The letter is not stamped top secret, confidential, 
or anything of the sort. Whoever reads the letter and reads it 
in good faith, without trying to slander, smear, humiliate, or 
degrade -- as people in our midst tend to do these days -- will 
see that it does not contain anything other than a reference to 
the existing situation in Jerusalem. 
  [Zissowitz] In retrospect, when you read the papers this 
morning and see that even commentators who usually support you 
are writing that your credibility has been tainted, do you not 
think you made a mistake? 
  [Peres] No. It is very easy for them to talk. Why not? 
After all, they were not the ones who conducted the 
negotiations. You cannot attribute all the negative things to 
me. Who achieved all the positive things? When you look at the 
entire picture of the negotiations and what happened to 
Jerusalem, I believe that Jerusalem received an unprecedented 
international boost, both from Christians and Muslims. 
  [Zissowitz] You sent a distinguished cabinet minister like 
Moshe Shahal to the Knesset podium to declare that those who 
claim they are in the possession of such a letter...[pauses] 
that the whole letter is merely the figment of a wild 
imagination. 
  [Peres] Which letter? 
  [Zissowitz] The same letter that Yasir 'Arafat claimed he 
had in his possession. 
  [Peres] No, excuse me, we are not talking about the same 
letter. My dear friend, please be accurate. I was not in 
Israel when Minister Shahal made the speech. He did not ask me, 
and I did not send him to the Knesset. Shahal was asked about a 
letter to 'Arafat, and no such letter exists. To repeat, all 
the stories that 'Arafat took part in the formulation of the 
letter or that he insisted that the word Christians appear 
before the word Muslims are the figment of a wild imagination. 
It makes absolutely no sense! All these are fanciful stories. 
  In his speech in the Knesset, Moshe Shahal referred to 
'Arafat's speech in Johannesburg. What did 'Arafat try to do in 
Johannesburg? He alleged that he had received a letter from us 
in Cairo -- and he did not receive a letter from us in Cairo -- 
and that the letter contained some promises about Jerusalem -- 
and these do not exist in reality; there are no such promises. 
In my opinion, Shahal's denial really and truly corresponded to 
the situation. 
  We left the status quo unchanged. Why did we do that? In 
order not to change it for the worse. Why did we agree to 
Jericho? So that the relevant institutions could be located in 
Jericho. 
  [Zissowitz] Let us talk about the relevant institutions, 
which, as you said in your letter, are very important. If the 
Palestinians really choose to conduct all the activities 
pertaining to the autonomy from Orient House.... 
  [Peres, interrupting] They have no permission to do that. 
  [Zissowitz] Will the status of this building also be upheld 
in such an event? 
  [Peres] Which building? 
  [Zissowitz] Orient House. 
  [Peres] Where does it say Orient House? 
  [Zissowitz] It says other institutions. 
  [Peres] Who says Orient House has been recognized? Listen, 
it is either one of two things: If it is legitimate and existed 
during the Likud's tenure, then it will continue to exist in the 
future. If it is not legitimate, then it must be closed down. 
This letter does not give any legitimization whatsoever to 
something that is illegitimate. 
  [Zissowitz] I would like you to clarify this point. If the 
Palestinians conduct their autonomy affairs from Orient House.... 
  [Peres, interrupting] We will close the place down. This 
would be in contravention of the agreement. Jerusalem is 
outside the autonomy agreement. It does not contain any 
permission whatsoever....[pauses] This whole thing looks like a 
bunch of Indians dancing around an imaginary bonfire. The whole 
purpose of the letter was to clarify that the autonomy 
institutions would be located in Jericho and that whatever 
existed in Jerusalem prior to the autonomy -- not during the 
autonomy -- would remain unchanged. 
  [Zissowitz] Generally speaking, will you agree to any 
compromise with the Palestinians with regard to the status of 
the Palestinian institutions operating in the city and the 
status of Jerusalem when these issues are discussed in the 
negotiations on the permanent arrangement? 
  [Peres] No, there will be no compromise where matters of 
government are concerned. My mind is made up, and I will not 
change it. All those who attack me are actually weakening 
Jerusalem; you know, in a bid to lash out at the government, 
they are weakening Jerusalem. My position is clear-cut and 
unequivocal: Jerusalem and no other city is the capital of 
Israel. Jerusalem will not be Berlin and will not be divided in 
two; it will remain a united city under Israeli sovereignty. I 
have said on more than one occasion, and I will repeat it now: 
Jerusalem is closed politically but open from the religious 
point of view. 
  Seeing that we are talking seriously, let me tell you 
something else. At times, a more relaxed and smarter style 
saves me arguments. What does the letter contain, after all? A 
promise to uphold the status quo. It contains no reference 
whatsoever to Orient House. I believe Orient House is Faysal 
al-Husayni's property. There were times when it was open and 
times when it was closed down. The letter does not contain any 
commitment whatsoever either to open it or to close it down. 
  [Zissowitz] Are there any other letters appended to the 
agreement? 
  [Peres] Not that I know of. I reiterate, all these alleged 
lies are totally unfounded. What lies? Did we send even one 
letter to 'Arafat? Was this letter sent before the agreement? 
Was it part of the agreement? And even after you read it, what 
does it contain? Only a reference to the existing situation, and 
that is all. 
  [Zissowitz] Finally, Foreign Minister Peres, did you 
mishandle the entire issue? 
  [Peres] No, I did not. I know some issues are bound to 
cause anger and aggravation, but I am determined. I think we 
have scored huge achievements. I think all we have done 
surpasses what the Likud had committed itself to many times 
over. I would like to tell you that if any forgery was ever 
committed, it was when the Likud signed an agreement citing the 
words Palestinian people [previous two words in English] and 
translated it into Hebrew as the Arabs of Eretz Yisra'el. At 
the time, everybody kept mum about it. Any schoolchild will 
tell you that Palestinian people [previous two words in English] 
means the Palestinian people. 
  [Zissowitz] But this is altogether a different issue. 
  [Peres] That is right. Nevertheless, we said we did not 
give a letter to 'Arafat, and we did not give a letter to 
'Arafat. There has been no change in the status and the 
situation of Jerusalem as it existed until the autonomy. There 
has been no such change. 
  [Zissowitz] Thank you very much, Foreign Minister Peres. 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0500 GMT on 7 June carries 
a similar live telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres by Mikha Friedman and Ya'el Dan. Asked what was the 
reason for sending such a letter a few days after the agreement 
was signed in Oslo, Peres replies: "The answer is quite clear. 
On the eve of the signing of the agreement in Oslo, a deep 
crisis emerged between us and the Palestinians which almost blew 
up the entire negotiations, because they wanted the autonomy 
institutions to be outside Jericho -- say, in Jerusalem. We 
said that they must be located only in Jericho and nowhere else 
or else there will be no agreement. They said: What about 
existing institutions, such as hospitals and schools? I said: 
We will not change the existing situation in Jerusalem. Holst 
asked me whether I would be prepared to put this in writing some 
day, and I replied: Yes, I have no problem with that. That is 
the whole story." 
  [Asked whether the future of Jerusalem will be discussed in 
the framework of the negotiations on the permanent arrangement 
or on the autonomy, the foreign minister replies: "In the 
framework of the permanent arrangement." 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0600 GMT on 7 June 
carries a summary of the interview with Foreign Minister Peres, 
adding that "correspondent Moti Amir points out that the text of 
the letter the Palestinians have in their possession is dated 9 
September, more than one month before the date written on 
Foreign Minister Peres' letter to Norwegian Foreign Minister 
Holst."]

<F P=106> [Report by Gid'on Alon] </F>
  [Excerpt] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has warned that if 
we do not continue the negotiating impetus with the Palestinians 
to extend the autonomy to other areas in the West Bank, the 
intifadah might be reignited. Peres, who addressed the Labor 
caucus, was sharply criticized by several faction members, who 
claimed that the government should not hurry to expand the 
self-rule area. 
  Labor Secretary General Nisim Zvili said the public feels 
that we should not rush ahead toward the next stages of the 
negotiations. He said we do not need to run faster than we 
undertook in the negotiations. Deputy Defense Minister 
Mordekhay Gur said that the main problem is that the coming 
stages in the negotiations include all the areas of Judaea, 
Samaria, and the Gaza Strip. Knesset Member 'Imanu'el Sussman 
retorted angrily: "You want to go on to the second stage, and I 
ask: What will happen in the area between Ma'ale Adumim and 
Jerusalem?" 
  The foreign minister said it is preferable to impose some 
self-rule on all the territories rather than all the self-rule 
on some of the territories. He said that the accord with the 
PLO opened up markets for us. "The agreement constitutes a big 
success, and I suggest not to pay attention to denigrations from 
all sides. For the first time in this century, we helped our 
partner take part in the peace process," Peres said. He said 
this was the first time Jerusalem has been removed from the 
self-rule. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Speech by Ayatollah 'Ali Hoseyni Khamene'i, leader of the </F>
Islamic revolution, to a gathering at the Imam Khomeyni 
Mausoleum in Tehran -- live] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God, the compassionate, the 
merciful. Praise be to God, lord of the universe. God's 
prayers and peace be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his scion and 
his companions. [passage omitted] 
  I express my condolences on the fifth anniversary of the 
demise of our great imam to all the truth-seeking Muslims of the 
world, especially to the dear and great Iranian nation. I 
sincerely express my regards to those who in the course of these 
five years have chosen the path of the imam as the luminous path 
of their lives and have exulted proudly in this fact, as well as 
those sincere and true disciples of that noble personage, who 
are numerous in our nation and in other nations. 
  Similarly, I consider it necessary to convey my sympathies 
to 
the respected and esteemed family of the late imam for the 
selfless service they rendered to that noble personality in the 
last years of his life. This was a heavy and major 
responsibility, which they took on themselves and carried out in 
the best possible manner, especially his illustrious and dear 
son Haj Seyyed Ahmad. 
  Today, I wish to mention a few points in memory of that 
noble 
personality as the basic points for future reference, study, and 
perception during this grand and tumultuous gathering. 
  First, I will begin with the personality of the imam, even 
though much has been said and written and sung about it by 
orators, authors, and singers. [passage omitted] 
  The imam's most noble action was to lay the foundation of an 
Islamic government and system. It would be worthwhile for our 
respected brothers and sisters to note the importance and 
greatness of this noble action of the imam so that it will be 
correctly etched in their minds. 
  Our revered imam established an Islamic system on which our 
Government is based. Then we have Islamic political 
institutions and a program which is also Islamic. All these 
three are worth pondering and mulling over. The Islamic system 
that the imam created and established in this country 
constitutes the format for the life of this nation in an Islamic 
mold with an Islamic meaning and bias. This Islamic system has 
faith as its main essence; faith in God, in the unknown. This 
system has a form, an image--the Islamic shari'ah. 
  Such a system has not existed in the course of history and 
does not exist elsewhere in the world today, except at the 
beginning [of Islam]. This system is based on the ingredient of 
faith, and an image, a corpus of the laws of the Islamic 
shari'ah. This system is exclusive, exceptional, and not well 
identified by the materialists, even though it is 
well-comprehended by Muslims who are familiar with the Koran and 
Islam. Of course, no one expected that such a system could be 
implemented in this day and age. It could not even be imagined 
that with so much hostility and opposition, any one could even 
dare to go in this direction or have the power to carry out this 
task. 
  However, the imam achieved the impossible through the 
strength of his faith, determination, and hard work, and with 
his reliance on the fervent and loving hearts of the millions. 
A prominent part of this system is the political apparatus, 
that is, the administration. This is the basic department in all 
systems, that is, the political element from which the system 
takes its form. It is on this basis that systems, ideologies, 
and objectives can be correctly identified. Our great imam 
forged a government unparalleled in the contemporary world, even 
in the course of history--except for some exceptional cases, 
right from the advent of Islam until today. [passage omitted] 
  The second characteristic of this political system is its 
independence, because it does not give in to extraneous 
pressure. Our system is not intimidated by any power and has 
ignored the decrees of the powerful ones of the world, who are 
equipped and armed with the weapons of wealth and might. This 
in itself is an unprecedented phenomenon in the world. However, 
in the system of the Islamic Republic of Iran, its nature is 
such that with the grace of our Creator, all the officials are 
endowed with these qualities. This noble figure [Khomeyni] was 
the most sublime example of these characteristics. The others 
are also blessed with these qualities. This is the kind of 
political apparatus of the Islamic system created by the imam. 
  The third point is the program. The program is also unique 
among the programs propounded by the reformers of the world, 
governments, and harbingers of new messages. Reconstruction of 
the world and of the hereafter goes hand in hand. The Islamic 
system wishes for people to flourish in this world but hopes 
they will not content themselves with that. The world and the 
hereafter are interrelated in the Islamic system and in the 
program of this system. Human beings should live in an 
honorable and comfortable manner, but comfort and welfare and 
all that ensures such comfort are mere preliminaries, subject to 
God's pleasure. They are only a precursor. This is an 
exceptional phenomenon on the plane of today's world and has 
been so throughout history, except for the governments of the 
prophets, their successors, and their implementors. 
  Everyone wishes to reform the material world for the people, 
but apparently they are not able to. However, the Islamic 
system reforms the world and the hereafter; it is capable of 
doing so. This is the strength which has been revealed by Islam. 
If the present situation of the country is viewed through the 
eyes of justice, this will be confirmed. Ours is a country on 
which a war was imposed for eight years. Its factories and 
roads were destroyed. An economic embargo was clamped on it. 
Its resources were wrested from it; and no assistance was 
extended by any government. 
  Internally, various kinds of pressure were exerted on the 
nation and government by political and propagandistic means. 
This country, this nation, this government is implementing the 
program to reconstruct the country, especially infrastructural 
projects, in a manner which has elicited the praise of 
observers. Those who come and perceive this process, commend 
the programs and their executors. 
  Without the pressure from the enemy, if the traitorous and 
trouble-making hands of the enemy had not existed, if the 
enemy's propagandistic and politico-economic presence had not 
lurked beyond our borders, the situation would have been far 
better and most of the economic problems that we have today 
would not exist. The Islamic system is concerned with the 
administration and prosperity of the world and the hereafter. 
No other program is concerned with the religion of the nation, 
the hereafter of human beings. The Islamic system imparts 
training and civilization. 
  Today in our country, a general movement can be observed, 
especially among our youths, toward learning the Koran, studying 
religion, abiding by Islamic tenets and injunctions. This is a 
distinguishing feature of the programs formulated by brains and 
hearts that have been guided by the Koran and Islam. These are 
not confined to the materialistic world. The materialists claim 
that they are ameliorating the world for the people, but they 
cannot do so. However, Islam focuses on the world and the 
hereafter; and by the grace of God, it is able to do so as well. 
Our people--as a result of Islam--have been endowed with 
exceptional faith, fortitude, and awareness, which is unique 
among the nations of the world. This range of characteristics 
together is the product of the work of this noble personage, the 
true servant of the Almighty. [crowd chants God is Great! 
Khomeyni is the Leader!] 
  I should make three points: There is a trend toward 
political centralization in the world and the wielder of world 
power is demanding that nations and governments should be 
reduced to captivity and follow the dictates of the central 
power, which today is the United States, its satellites and 
cohorts. Many have failed and fallen in the path of this trend. 
The Islamic Republic of Iran, however, has stood steadfast. 
  Blessed by this steadfastness, the Islamic Republic of Iran 
declares its categorical stance on the Palestinian issue while 
others do not have the courage even to listen to it at times. 
This categorical declaration, on which the Iranian nation and 
Government are unanimous, is that Palestine is a country that 
belongs to the Palestinian people. The Zionist government is a 
despotic government; the principles of this government and 
system are absolutely illegitimate. [crowd chants] 
  Many do not even have the courage to listen to those who 
utter such remarks. Thus, the talks that are being held on 
Palestine are nothing but empty words. They do not have any 
worth or credibility, because they are in contradiction of the 
truth and the accepted norms. Contrary to this, the views of 
the Government and people of the Islamic Republic of Iran on all 
international issues are independent and truthful. 
  As for the Muslims in the Balkans, we believe that the 
pressure on the Balkan Muslims is to insure that a Muslim nation 
and a Muslim government do not take shape in Europe. The fear 
is of Islam. Thus, it was on the basis of a calculated plan that 
the domineering powers in the world today have not supported the 
Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina. They know what they are doing. 
They have supported and assisted the Serbs in a calculated 
manner. They prevented arms and military equipment from 
reaching the Muslims in a calculated manner. This is the view 
of our Government and nation; it constitutes a condemnation of 
the present domineering powers with regard to the issues of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Balkans. 
  With regard to the newly independent Muslims of Central 
Asia, 
the Kashmiri Muslims, the Azerbaijani Muslims, the Muslims in 
every part of Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, the opinion of 
our Government and nation is that it is the right of these 
Muslims to live in an Islamic manner and to implement the 
injunctions of the Islamic shari'ah in their daily lives. No 
one has the right to prevent them from doing so. Western powers 
that describe this as fundamentalism prevent some of these 
countries from even holding free elections. We believe that this 
interference and encroachment with regard to the affairs of 
Muslim nations is tyrannical and unwarranted. They have the 
right to have an Islamic way of life and should be given an 
opportunity to do so. 
  On the issue of Lebanon, the Iranian nation and government 
condemn the Zionist aggression; we deem the struggle against the 
Zionists imperative and accords with them as invalid. These are 
the independent stances of the Islamic system and the Islamic 
government and these are the reasons why the pyramid of 
international power levels accusations against the system of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran. This is where the accusations stem 
from. 
  The second point is that these so-called accusations 
probably 
stem from a distortion of realities. In many cases, they refer 
to what is actually a point of strength in the system of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran. For example, they accuse the Islamic 
Republic of Iran of fundamentalism. By this term they mean 
prejudice and Stone Age beliefs. This means, in fact, the 
refusal on the part of the Iranian people and government to 
surrender to the unjust desires of the international powers, so 
we are labeled as primeval. No. This is the rightful stance of 
a Muslim nation; it is not a primeval belief. If fundamentalism 
is the term used for respect for accepted principles, it is 
commendable and all should be proud of it. It is a lie to term 
it primeval and prejudicial, and it is a false accusation 
against the Iranian Government and nation. 
  Then they slander the Islamic Republic of Iran by saying 
that 
it does not adhere to human rights. They mean the 
implementation of Islamic penal laws [hodud]. We implement the 
Islamic ordinances. The Koran says: "Those are limits set by 
God: and anyone who transgresses the limits of God does verily 
wrong his (own) soul." Anyone who violates God's laws is 
subjected to the Almighty's chastisement. These are divine 
laws. We consider the understanding of the Koran and its text 
to have priority over the products of the impaired minds of the 
Western legislators who have laid out knowledge and inventions 
for themselves and give them precedence over the gnosis of 
Divine religions. We believe that the divine laws are to be 
given preference. 
  The path to the reform of a society is through the 
implementation of divine ordinances. It is possible that we may 
have shortcomings in this regard, but we are definitely moving 
in the direction of the complete implementation of the divine 
penal laws, of Koranic laws. This was the second point. 
  The last point is that our path is that of perseverance, 
following the attainment of the objectives of the Islamic system 
as this great person [Khomeyni] has delineated for us in the 
lessons by our great imam and as embodied in his will. This is 
the path of this nation. My dear brothers and sisters all over 
the country should heed the fact that the path to the happiness 
of the Iranian nation is to have recourse to Islamic and divine 
injunctions. 
  The path to the happiness of the Iranian nation is through 
reliance on the nation itself, its capabilities, and aptitudes. 
The road to the prosperity of this nation lies in severing all 
hopes from the domineering powers of the world and in not 
fearing these powers. Do not be afraid of them in the slightest 
and do not expect anything at all from them, even anything as 
tiny as the point of a needle. 
  My dear ones, the greatest gift given by the Islamic 
Revolution to this nation is that it has removed the evil of the 
corrupt and servile governments who for many years had imposed 
themselves on this country, this nation and these bounties of 
God. Today, with the blessings of the Almighty, the 
administrators of this country are the people themselves. 
Today, with the vigilance and endeavors of these people, the 
best form of popular government in accordance with the will of 
the people exists in this country. 
  Of course, the enemy denies this in his propaganda and this 
is how it should be. What else can we expect from the enemy! 
Here, the people elect an individual in accordance with their 
beliefs, their own criteria, Islamic criteria, for administering 
the country's executive matters, for legislation and guidance of 
the executive officials, with the ultimate freedom, reliance on 
faith and this is what is exceptional. If, in the well-known 
democratic countries in today's world, differences between 
factions, disputes among parties, and political tussles are the 
motivation behind elections, in this Islamic country, in the 
proud and honorable country of Iran, voting is carried out 
solely for the sake of faith and the recognition of divine 
values. This is what is worthwhile and important and this is 
what there is today. 
  In the whole world, I do not know of any place where there 
is 
a bond of affection, a rapport from the heart between the nation 
and the officials as is the case in Iran. The nation loves the 
officials and the officials love the nation with all their being 
and consider themselves to be at their service. This nation has 
such sentiments regardless of what the enemy's propaganda says. 
[passage omitted] 
  As the last sentence of my remarks, I wish to say that the 
Iranian nation and the officials should preserve these traits 
with all their power and being. [chants of God is great! other 
indiscernible chants]. The government and the people should 
safeguard the path of God, the path of Islam. The officials 
should not forget the people even for a second. In the great 
movement toward our reconstruction program, the underprivileged 
should be given intensive attention. The Islamic Majles should 
pass the laws, the government will implement them and the 
Judiciary will oversee the implementation of these laws with all 
its being. The nation will tread this path with all its 
strength and valor. This is the path of Islam, the Koran, of 
the religion of God, and the path that the great imam blazed for 
us. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tehran, June 7, IRNA -- President Akbar 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani here Tuesday expressed optimism over further 
improvement in the international oil market in the current 
calendar year. The president was speaking at a press conference 
this morning with the participation of over 100 local and 
foreign reporters and cameramen. 
  "It seems that situation in the oil market would further 
improve this year," the president replied to a question. 
  On the impact of the recent visit to Iran of a group of 
American editors on Tehran-Washington relations, the president 
said: "Such a visit could have no impact on the relations but 
could shed further light on some of the realities for the 
American people." 
  As for Iran's view over the policy the British Government 
has 
adopted in former Yugoslavia, Hashemi-Rafsanjani told the 
reporters that there were evidences proving that Britain did not 
cooperate well to repel the Serbs aggressions. 
  Commenting on [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia leader] 
Zhirinovskiy's statement that Russia should dominate its 
southern neighboring countries including Iran, President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani said: "The Islamic Republic of Iran considers 
such statements as the viewpoints of an irresponsible individual 
and attaches no value to such words." 
  In reply to a question on situation in Iraq the president 
noted: "We had repeatedly condemned Iraqi aggressions in the 
past and believe that the Ba'th Party has treated the Iraqi 
people improperly. On the other hand, we believe that Saudi 
Arabia's measures claimed to be for the salvation of Iraqi 
people is not proper." 
  On the export of the Islamic revolution, the president said 
that the issue of the export of revolution has never been 
raised. "We have said that we would elucidate our ideology and 
those inhezed [as received] could accept it. We will employ all 
our potentials for the developmenf our country." 
  As for the future of Tehran-London ties, given the British 
bugging of the Iranian embassy, the president said that the 
outcome of Britain's illegal measure is mistrust in bilateral 
relations and we do not want to see such an atmosphere of 
mistrust prvail on our reations with other countries. 
  On fluctuations in foreign currency rates, 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani 
said measures were underway to adjust supply and demand in order 
to approach the single parity rate. He predicted that the 
actual foreign currency rate will appear in the coming months 
which he said would be lower than the current rates. 
  In reply to a question on the probable amendment of the 
Constitution to facilitate his re-election at the end of the 
presidential tenure, the president said he would rather prefer 
no change in the Constitution. "If I perform my duties properly 
within these eight years, I think there will be no need for 
re-electing me," he added. 
  On foreign investment in Iran President Hashemi-Rafsanjani 
said that there was no restriction on the investment of foreign 
countries within the framework of the Islamic Republic 
Constitution. 
  As for foreign minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati's participation 
in the Cairo Non-aligned Movement ministerial session, the 
president said that the visit did not imply a change in Iran's 
Middle East policy and Velayati's presence in Egypt was only for 
attending the meeting. 
  On Iran's cooperation with Central Asian republics despite 
U.S. hindrances, he said the areas of cooperation were so 
natural and vast that no one could stop it. However, he added, 
dimensions of cooperation might shrink due to foreign pressures, 
but, it should be noted that Iran and Central Asian region were 
complementary to each other and none could deny it. He also 
noted that Iran was determined to boost its cooperation with 
Asian countries. Cooperation within the framework of the 
Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) as well as bilateral 
cooperation with India and Malaysia were expanding, he said. 
  The president added that tripartite cooperation among Iran, 
Pakistan and India could lead to the formation of a great 
economic grouping in the region and in order to achieve this 
objective, the Indo-Pak differences should be settled. 
  On assassination of Iranian dissidents in some European 
countries, Hashemi-Rafsanjani noted that the alleged involvement 
of Iranian officials in the killing of Iranian dissidents abroad 
is an unfounded allegation, adding that "we think that the 
killings are the result of inter-group rivalries". He 
underlined that Iran's policy is not to eliminate the dissidents 
but to encourage them to embrace Islam and return to their own 
country. 
  Commenting on the prospect of Iran-Egypt relations, the 
president said: "We believe that by signing the Camp David 
Accord, Egypt created a gulf among the anti-Zionist Muslim and 
Arab countries. Nevertheless we consider Egypt as a great 
Islamic country and welcome conditions enabling us to resume 
relations with that country." 
  In response to a question on Tehran-London relations, 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani said that there was no need to cut off 
relations, the two countries once witnessed the break-off of the 
relations and found out that it could not change anything. The 
relations, even though at a low level, should exist, we only 
react to any inappropriate action on their part, he added. 
  On Iran-U.S. trade relations, the president said that Iran 
has never broken off its trade relations with the U.S. "As for 
diplomatic relations with the U.S., we believe that the U.S. 
lacks goodwill and it has not taken a proper position during the 
post revolution era. The Americans are for dialogue but we 
think it will not be in our interest to start negotiations," he 
said. "If U.S. officials have good intentions, they should 
first release Iran's frozen assets," the president said. 
  The two countries have a broad trade cooperation, he 
reiterated, adding "a great deal of our military equipment is 
made in the U.S. and therefore we cannot throw away such a great 
national asset." 
  "We showed our goodwill by helping secure the release of 
American hostages in Lebanon but the Washington government did 
not keep its promise of releasing our frozen assets. This 
caused us to lose our trust in them," Hashemi-Rafsanjani said. 
  In reply to a question as to reasons for inviting American 
editors to Iran, the president said that not all writers should 
be considered agents of the global arrogance. There are 
freedom-loving people working in foreign mass media who write 
the truth, Hashemi-Rafsanjani said. He added that considering 
anti-Iranian propaganda in the U.S., the invitation of American 
journalists was a positive measure. 
  On claims of human rights abuses in Iran raised by the 
global 
arrogance, the president said that human rights were routinely 
violated in the West but "they (Western countries) are making 
hue and cry over the issue because their propaganda machine is 
stronger than ours." 
  "I openly declare that human rights are observed in the 
Islamic Republic better than in any other parts of the world and 
we are ready to debate with anybody who claims otherwise," he 
said. 
  Commenting on planned negotiations in tehran between 
belligerent parties in Tajikistan, Hashemi-Rafsanjani noted that 
the war was not in the interest of either Tajik government or 
people. He added that Iran would try to restore peace to that 
country in cooperation with the parties involved. On Iran's 
mediation efforts in Azerbaijan-Armenia dispute, he stressed 
that "although the mediation efforts have not been successful 
yet, we have not been disappointed." 
  The continuation of conflict will not benefit either 
Armenia, 
Azerbaijan or Karabakh, the president said, adding that Iran 
intended to launch new efforts to establish peace in the region. 
  In response to a question as to whether or not an Israeli 
pilot was held in Iran, he said for sure no Israeli pilot was in 
Iran. By raising such allegations, the Zionist regime is trying 
to cover up the kidnapping of four Iranians in Lebanon, the 
president said. The Westerners should not view the issue from 
their own self-interested perspective but should also be 
sensitive to the abduction of the four Iranians. 
  On the claim of the United Arab Emirates on the three 
Iranian 
islands in the Persian Gulf, the president warned "the United 
Arab Emirates will gain nothing from such claims and they have 
to cross a sea of blood in order to reach these islands." 
However, Hashemi-Rafsanjani voiced Iran's readiness to 
negotiate with UAE officials on the issue. 
  On Iran's stance on the current crisis in Yemen, the 
president said Iran was against the partition of Yemen, 
believing that Yemen should remain united. 
  He stressed that Iran was not after nuclear weapons, saying 
that this has been confirmed by inspectors of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) who regularly visited Iran. 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani added that "Iran is not for proliferation of 
nuclear arms but is for the nuclear disarmament of all 
countries. Every and each country should try to eliminate 
atomic weapons." 
  On the Middle East peace talks, Hashemi-Rafsanjani said 
"what 
is going on now is not peace because during the negotiations the 
rights of the Palestinian nation are denied." He reiterated 
that Iran was not going to interfere in the ongoing negotiations 
between Arabs and the Zionist regime.

  [Excerpt] Six deputy chairmen of the Transitional National 
Council were elected today in accordance with the internal 
statute passed a week ago. The Transitional National Council 
today held a session chaired by Mr. Abdelkader Bensalah, the 
council's chairman, to begin the election of six deputy chairmen 
from among the 22 candidates. Over to Nacema Kerat. 
  [Kerat] The election was held today by secret ballot and 
resulted in only two candidates winning in the first round by 
obtaining the majority required by the internal statute. They 
were Mr. Mohamed Taher (Dilmi), national secretary of the UGTA 
[Algerian General Workers Union], and Mr. Abdelmadjid 
(Monacera), national secretary in charge of information in HAMAS 
[Islamic Society Movement]. 
  This meant that a second round had to be held to elect the 
other four deputy chairmen. Following the voting in this round, 
the following were elected as deputy chairmen: Abdelouahab 
(Oughidmi) of the Sons of the Martyrs Organization, Abdelhafiz 
Amoukran (Elhaceni) of the War Veterans' Organization, Nacer 
(Sakhri) of the National Party for Solidarity and Development, 
and Hacen (Haider) of the National Union of Algerian Farmers. 
  Thus the council has completed the formation of its bureau 
that is composed of a chairman and six deputy chairman. [passage

<F P=106> [Report by Randah Habib from Amman] </F>
  [Text] Jordanian parliamentary sources have disclosed that 
Syria and Israel have reached an agreement on the broad outlines 
of Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which Israel 
occupied in 1967, pointing out that the U.S.-brokered 
negotiations between the two sides will resume soon. Citing 
Jordanian Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, these source 
said that Damascus has made further steps conditional on an 
Israeli Knesset announcement of the abrogation of the decision 
under which Israel annexed the Golan Heights. The decision was 
issued in January 1981. Syria has also demanded that Israel 
publicly recognize UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 
on the principle of exchanging land for peace, as well as 
Resolution 425 calling for Israel's withdrawal from southern 
Lebanon. 
  The timetable for the Israeli withdrawal remains the subject 
of dispute because the Jewish state is talking about seven years 
while Syria insists that the period should not exceed three 
years, according these same sources. If Israel meets Syria's 
conditions, Damascus will be prepared to raise the level of 
bilateral negotiations -- something that has been demanded by 
Israel. Only then will U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher resume his shuttle tours between the two states. 
  In another development, Syria is demanding a piece of land 
known as the Palestinian Golan Heights in the Syrian al-Hammah 
area. It was annexed to the Syrian Golan Heights in 1938 and 
then was occupied by Israel along with the rest of the heights 
during the Six-Day War. Israel, however, refuses to withdraw 
from it.

<F P=106> [Report by Muhammad Sadiq] </F>
  [Excerpt] Washington -- Representatives from the United 
States, Jordan, and Israel yesterday began talks in Washington 
which will last two days, that is in the framework of the 
tripartite U.S.-Jordanian-Israeli committee formed in the wake 
of the creditor states conference held in Washington at the 
beginning of last October, to discuss economic issues. Israel 
and Jordanian officials are hoping that these talks will help to 
break the deadlock in the peace negotiations. 
  Sources in Washington have said that the talks, which are 
the 
fourth round held by the committee, will discuss issues like the 
issue of the border between Jordan and Israel, as the latter has 
agreed to discuss it in these talks. The sources denied that 
the talks are a kind of Jordanian separation to secure a peace 
agreement with Israel. 
  Meanwhile, Jordanian sources have said that the talks being 
held in Washington were not allocated to discussing the border 
issue, but to discussing economic issues in the framework of the 
tripartite committee. But Israel agreed to discuss the border 
issue. 
  The sources pointed out that the talks will also deal with 
the water issue between the two countries. However, they 
stressed that it is out of the question for Jordan to sign a 
peace agreement outside the scope of the comprehensive solution 
on the basis of which the peace process was launched. [passage

<F P=106> [Report by Elimelekh Ram from Washington] </F>
  [Excerpt] The economic talks between Israel and Jordan 
will be transferred to the Middle East. This was decided at the 
end of another round of talks in Washington. It was also 
decided that a border survey will be performed by joint Israeli 
and Jordanian teams. Elimelekh Ram reports from the U.S. 
capital: 
  [Begin recording] [Ram] The fact that Major General 'Uzi 
Dayan, head of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] Planing Branch, 
took part in the talks which were mainly economic, attests to 
the security aspect of the decisions made -- whether the issue 
in question is planning a road that would link Israel and Jordan 
or whether it was the establishment of joint projects in areas 
that could be sensitive from a security point of view. Dr. 
Elyaqim Rubinstein, head of the Israeli delegation, sums up the 
current round of talks: 
  [Rubinstein] This was a good round of contacts on both the 
tripartite level of Israel, Jordan, and the United States -- 
which mainly focused on economic issues such as trade, finance, 
and projects -- as well as on the level of the additional talks 
we held with Jordan -- which focused on issues such as security, 
borders, water, and the like. 
  [Ram] The atmosphere at the talks was most optimistic. 
There is a Jordanian readiness to make progress in the 
negotiations. [passage omitted] [end recording]

delegations will discuss building a highway which will connect 
Jordan, Egypt, and Israel in the al-'Aqabah-Elat area. Jordan

  [Text] Meetings of the tripartite Jordanian-U.S.-Israeli 
economic committee were concluded in Washington yesterday 
evening. Chief Jordanian delegate Dr. Fayiz al-Tarawinah said 
that the talks addressed economic topics listed on the agenda, 
including Palestinian-Israeli agreements and the issue of 
developing the Jordan Valley. The conferees examined working 
papers that addressed a comprehensive development of the Jordan 
Valley, as well as future projects, about which the U.S. side 
expressed a willingness to chart an overall plan, Dr. 
al-Tarawinah added. 
  Dr. al-Tarawinah went on to say: During these talks, the 
Jordanian side underscored the importance of linking these 
topics to the bilateral issues contained in the 
Jordanian-Israeli agenda signed on 14 September 1993, 
particularly the issues of borders, occupied Jordanian 
territories, and water. It must be recalled that the agenda is 
an indivisible whole, and that all the topics contained in it 
must be discussed and negotiated in accordance with the terms of 
reference of the peace process, and on the basis of the 
provisions enshrined in the joint agenda. 
  Dr. al-Tarawinah said: A main broad Jordanian-Israeli 
committee has been set up to discuss the issues of borders, 
security, water resources, environment, and other issues. 
Subcommittees will emanate from this main committee. Moreover, 
efforts to demarcate and delineate borders will start. 
Discussions also touched on other issues that need further 
study, such as the issue pertaining to the road that will link 
Jordan, Egypt, and Israel, and other issues pertaining to the 
projects included in the Jordanian paper on the Jordan Valley. 
A subagenda on water resources, energy, and environment, and 
another subagenda on borders, occupied territories, and security 
have been agreed on. The negotiations will be conducted within 
the context of the subcommittees. Discussions of technical 
issues will be resumed in the region to achieve the highest 
possible degree of accuracy, particularly with regard to the 
issue of borders. The talks are scheduled to resume next month.

  [Text] The Arab League regrets the new eruption of fighting 
in Yemen only a few hours after Sanaa accepted a cease-fire as 
announced by its foreign minister, Muhammad Salim Basindwah. 
  Counselor Tal'at Hamid, the Arab League secretary general's 
press spokesman, said that the resumption of military action in 
Yemen does not help create the appropriate circumstances for 
negotiations. He added that the Arab League supports any Arab 
or international effort to stop this destructive war in line 
with UN Security Council Resolution 924. 
  Hamid reported that the Arab League secretary general is 
constantly in touch with Yemeni leaders in the north and south 
and with several other Arab countries to implement the Security 
Council resolution.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Ali Jamalu from Damascus] </F>
  [Text] Arab League Assistant Secretary General 'Adnan 
'Imran has criticized the biased U.S. position which favors 
Israel in the ongoing peace operation. He stressed that the 
Arab boycott of Israel will continue and will not end until its 
goal of making the occupation disappear is reached. Concerning 
the Yemeni war, he said the Arab League's position is 
illustrated by its call for a cease-fire and resuming dialogue. 
  In an interview with AL-SAFIR in Damascus, 'Imran commented 
on U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's recent Middle 
East tour by saying: "Every effort made by the parties capable 
of putting pressure on Israel is welcome. However the role of 
sponsor, or intermediary, requires basic specific qualifications 
that might prove very important in attaining the desired 
objective. The primary qualification is impartiality. If we 
examine this point, we will notice a fatal flaw. Israel almost 
totally and continuously lives on absolute U.S. backing. In 
this connection I wish to express regret over the recent U.S. 
arms deals for Israel which seem to suggest that the coming 
climate will be one of war, not peace." 
  'Imran continued: "The seriousness of this issue lies in the 
fact that Israel interprets such arms deals as encouragement for 
its intransigence, rejection, prevarication, and 
procrastination. This is how Israel interprets the U.S. 
Administration's unjust and unfair attitude to Syria and several 
other Arab countries which the U.S. State Department puts on the 
list of countries that support terrorism. This is a 
questionable, political list." 
  The Arab assistant secretary general continued: "This 
contravenes the logic of neutrality and balance in relations 
that a mediator must possess. At any rate we would like this 
mediator's role to continue but would like the U.S. sponsor to 
reconsider its attitude." 
  On the Arab boycott of Israel, 'Imran said: "We do not 
boycott Israel for the fun of it. At the same time we do not 
want to surrender or abandon Arab rights. This explains our 
statement that ending the boycott hinges on ending its causes. 
These causes are the occupation and Israel's defiance of the 
international community through its continued aggression. When 
the cause disappears, the consequence will end. Furthermore, 
the boycott is not something we invented. We have merely copied 
about five percent of the boycotts carried out by the United 
States worldwide with and without justification. We hope that 
the boycott will end along with its causes when a just, 
comprehensive, and lasting peace is attained and UN resolutions 
are implemented. 
  On Qatar and Oman's hosting of two Israeli delegations, 
'Imran said: "We did not arrange these visits. What we stick 
by is that all Arab countries, including Qatar and Oman, during 
official meetings should affirm their adherence to peace that 
leads to withdrawal and ends aggression. They also should not 
have any dealings with Israel under any circumstances, as long 
as it is an aggressor and occupier and does not adhere to the 
stipulations of international law. These are important points 
and I believe that no normalization of relations should take 
place by any country that adheres to our central cause, be that 
from the point of view of patriotism, religion, or heritage. By 
this, I mean the Arab and Islamic countries. All occupied 
territories must be regained, including Jerusalem, before 
normalizing relations with Israel." 
  'Imran said: "All of Israel's desperate attempts to set up 
bridges between it and some Islamic countries must fail. I can 
safely say that such bridges are weak and will certainly 
collapse. Israel is fooling itself if it believes that it will 
realize any gains in this direction. In fact, such a method 
will reveal to what extent Israel will indirectly feel that it 
is an aggressor and that it has no pride when grovelling for 
relations with any of these countries." 
  On the role the Arab League is playing to stop the Yemeni 
war, 'Imran said that the Arab League's initiative did not fail, 
but was not complete. "The Arab stand was clear. It demanded a 
cease-fire and called for dialogue to preserve the unity of the 
Yemeni people." 
  He added that it was not easy to reach Sanaa. "We overcame 
all the difficulties of our objective. There also, our mission 
was not easy. The Arab League Secretariat's delegation exerted 
its utmost efforts through a series of meetings it held with the 
Yemeni leaders. These meetings were crowned by a meeting with 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. The delegation presented the 
League's stand, which included a message from the secretary 
general to Salih and provided additional explanations of the 
Arab stand, as unanimously expressed by the Arab countries 
during the extraordinary Arab League session." 
  The Arab League assistant secretary general said that our 
mission's first stop was successful, despite the atmosphere of 
fighting which is not constructive. "I cannot make an 
evaluation as to whether or not the mission failed at our second 
stop, because so far, we have not received a satisfactory or 
final answer to the Arab initiative presented by the Arab 
League's delegation. We were hoping to get a commitment to a 
final cease-fire; however, we realize that situations under such 
circumstances cannot be resolved with the ease that we would 
like. These difficulties require greater efforts, which is what 
the secretary general is currently doing, through his daily 
contacts with the Arab leaders to establish a speedy mechanism 
for implementing the Arab League Council's resolution issued 
during its extraordinary session." 
  'Imran said: "The Arab initiative has not ended at all. We 
hope that the end of the initiative will be when its goals, 
which I pointed out earlier, are realized: Immediately halting 
the fighting, working on restoring dialogue, and preserving the 
unity of Yemen.

  [Text] Five Palestinians were wounded last night in Rafah 
by Israeli soldiers, who launched a search inside the autonomous 
area. A Qol Yisra'el reporter says the soldiers thought they 
were under fire, but the shooting was in fact from a Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement] group that was firing in the air 
to celebrate the release of one of their members from the 
Qezi'ot prison. The Palestinian police are investigating the 
incident. 
  In Jericho, a Palestinian resident was lightly wounded 
yesterday when Palestinian police opened fire. The victim 
reportedly drove through a police roadblock without stopping. 
  In Gaza, the Palestinian police arrested four members of the 
Fatah Hawks for shooting and wounding six residents of the 
Tuffah neighborhood, one of them seriously and two others 
moderately. The Qol Yisra'el reporter says the Fatah Hawks 
tried to arrest a car thief, claiming they were from the 
Palestinian security service. The driver put up a fight and a 
shooting broke out. The four Hawks were arrested and their guns 
were confiscated. 
  In another incident, the Palestinian police demolished a 
house in the Rimal area that had been built illegally on public 
land. 
  An Israeli was lightly injured last night on the 
Trans-Samaria Highway when his car was stoned near the Arab 
village of Mashah.

  [Text] Jerusalem, June 5 (AFP) -- Israel told the 
Palestinian Authority on Sunday [5 June] they must set up their 
radio station in the autonomous enclave of Jericho and not in 
the occupied West Bank town of Ramallah as planned. 
  The head of the Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation [PBC], 
Radwan Abu-'Ayyash, told AFP he had asked for an official 
meeting after the Israelis notified him of their decision. 
  The PBC had intended to site the studios in Ramallah where a 
pre-1967 transmitter and radio masts are being renovated. 
  "Now we cannot have the studios in Ramallah," Abu-'Ayyash 
said. The town is not part of the autonomous areas. 
  "They have to be in Jericho or Gaza, only the transmission 
will be in Ramallah. 
  "We asked for a meeting to discuss this officially. We 
prefer to have the studios in Ramallah," he stressed. 
  However the Palestinians had managed to get radio equipment 
donated by Germany out of Israeli customs without paying duty 
after a three-week battle, Abu-'Ayyash said. 
  The sound and editing equipment was intended first for 
training new staff, he said. 
  The Palestinians hope to launch a radio service in July 
following the start of autonomy in Jericho and the Gaza Strip 
last month and the PBC has taken on a full-time staff of 17. 
  They also have plans for a television channel, but that will 
take longer to set up, Abu-'Ayyash said.

  [Text] Tunis, 7 Jun (MENA) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister 
'Amr Musa said if the Yemenis are talking about unity, their 
primary objective should be to preserve vital resources and 
facilities in Yemen. 
  In press statements he made in Tunis today on developments 
in 
Yemen, 'Amr Musa added that the unity that was established based 
on the agreement of both sides cannot be imposed by force. The 
various parties must show actual commitment to the Security 
Council resolution on the Yemeni crisis. If the fighting 
continues, however, it will destroy all of Yemen. 
  'Amr Musa clarified that adherence to the cease-fire in 
Yemen 
is not mere talk; it should be respected in word and deed. He 
said the continued fighting and strikes against installations, 
despite declarations that both parties adhere to the cease-fire, 
means they reject the Security Council resolution. 
  Answering a question on the statement the Gulf Cooperation 
Council [GCC] foreign ministers issued the day before yesterday 
on events in Yemen, 'Amr Musa said the statement contains 
important results and expresses the frustration with events in 
Yemen. He added that it was only natural to hold a GCC meeting, 
because the situation in Yemen cannot be ignored and left the 
way it is. 
  Musa affirmed that the solution to the crisis in Yemen is 
respect for the Security Council resolution and the cease-fire 
in Yemen. Moreover, the forces must be separated from each other 
and dialogue between the various parties must start.

  [Text] The leaders of the Wafd, National Progressive 
Unionist Grouping, and the Liberal parties have issued the 
following statement explaining their stand on the formation of a 
committee to prepare for the national dialogue: 
  The leaders of the parties signed this statement; 
  Out of their concern to continue the national dialogue on a 
sound and correct basis capable of achieving the hopes that the 
Egyptian masses have pinned on it; 
  Out of their commitment to the homeland's interests that 
require us to work together toward a real understanding 
established on the basis of free and equal expression and on the 
basis of the various political forces' direct and equal 
participation in setting out its agenda, basis, and the rules 
that govern it; 
  While noting that the committee to prepare for the national 
dialogue was not formed in the right manner; both in form -- as 
the committee was imposed by one party without consultations -- 
and in substance -- as the majority of the committee members 
were chosen from the ranks of the ruling party [National 
Democratic Party]; 
  While noting that the choice of the rapporteur was 
successful, and despite our respect for the rapporteur, we 
believe that it would have been better if consultations were 
held on the choice of the rapporteur, his role, whether he is 
the chairman of the conferees, their sole spokesman, or whether 
he is just the organizer of the sessions; 
  While reviewing the decision of the Wafd and the Democratic 
Nasirite parties not to participate in the dialogue so as to 
record their objections, most of which can be said to be 
objective and should be taken into account; 
  They believe that it is necessary to review the issue and to 
attempt to try to reach a common understanding over the 
committee's form and composition, the rapporteur and his role, 
the system of expressing views, and the various parties' right 
to voice their opinions. This might make it incumbent upon us 
all to participate directly in a common and constant dialogue 
until we reach an understanding that will ensure that the 
national dialogue will start properly and achieve equality and 
which can achieve the desired outcome. 
  Hence, the signatories of this appeal call on all the 
parties 
to seek to hold collective and bilateral dialogues with the aim 
of reaching a common agreement before the start of the national 
dialogue committee's sessions. 
  There is a period of time between today and 12 June -- the 
date set for the committee's second session -- during which an 
attempt can be made to achieve an understanding on the needed 
bases and avoid the mistakes which have invoked our 
observations. While these consultations require more time, we 
believe there is a need to give them ample opportunity for 
unifying our views and uniting all the political forces within 
the framework of the national dialogue for the sake of achieving 
the desired national interest. Hence, being committed to a 
fixed date might not be necessary. What is necessary is to find 
an ample opportunity for real consultations and for reaching new 
agreements. 
  Our objective from all this is the homeland's interest and 
ensuring the success of the dialogue on a basis that achieves 
equality and sufficient respect for all its parties. 
  God is our witness.

  [Text] Cairo, 7 Jun (MENA) -- A responsible security 
official has denied a report by a news agency on a recent clash 
in the town of Akhmim in Suhaj Governorate between worshipers at 
al-Sahabah Mosque and a number of extremist elements. 
  The source said this report is totally false. There is no 
truth in it, since no confrontation or clashes of any kind took 
place at all, as the agency claimed. 
  According to the news agency report, six persons, including 
two extremists, were injured at al-Sahabah Mosque in Akhmim 
during a confrontation between worshipers and elements described 
as terrorist.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abdallah Kamal] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Mustafa Mashhur, the strong 
man in the Muslim Brotherhood, denies any link between the group 
and violence. In an interview with ROSE AL-YUSUF, he said: Our 
method since we came out of prison has been not to participate 
in any incident. Our connection with any extremist group has 
not been proven, from Shaykh al-Dhahabi [killed by the 
Repudiation and Renunciation group], the Military Technical 
School incidents, the assassination of al-Sadat, to the Asyut 
incidents. We in fact have issued several statements 
criticizing violence. 
  [ROSE AL-YUSUF] The repentant al-Shawqiyun Group leader has 
accused you of supporting terrorism with money. 
  [Mashhur] I have no knowledge of that. Let them 
investigate. If it is proven that Ahmad 'Ubayd (the man named by 
'Adil 'Abd-al- Baqi in his confessions) or any one else has done 
so, let them bring them to account. But the Muslim Brotherhood 
has nothing to do with this. 
  [ROSE AL-YUSUF] Don't you have any connection with Ahmad 
'Ubayd? 
  [Mashhur] I mean that we have nothing to do with the money, 
and Ahmad 'Ubayd has not informed us that he gave money. 
  [ROSE AL-YUSUF] Does the Muslim Brotherhood intend to 
escalate the situation and declare civil disobedience in the 
professional unions? 
  [Mashhur] Our method is moderation, and not violence, 
capitulation, and weakness. We are carrying out a message. 
This is the right of every citizen. It is my right to say that 
Islam is the solution, just as others say socialism is the 
solution. Actually, we exist legally, but it is they [the 
government] who do not want to recognize us. 
  [ROSE AL-YUSUF] Can any professional union undertake any 
measure without your decision? 
  [Mashhur] Yes. We only give general guidance and do not 
interfere in all matters. 
  We are not against dialogue with the officials. It is they 
who are against dialogue with us. Our work is done in the open. 
There is no secret organization, as some people claim. 
  [ROSE AL-YUSUF] If a dialogue takes place, what are the 
issues on its agenda? 
  [Mashhur] Emissaries from Al-Ahram Research Center came to 
see us. We said we do not object to dialogue, provided the 
government allows political rights to the people, a party, the 
publication of a paper, and free elections. 
  [ROSE AL-YUSUF] So what is required to end the confrontation 
is a party and a newspaper. 
  [Mashhur] What I mean is freedom of expression--instead of 
licensing parties that have no assets and claiming that the 
establishment of a Muslim Brotherhood party will lead to 
sectarian strife. Our relations with the Copts since the time 
of al-Banna have been good. 
  [ROSE AL-YUSUF] Is there an intention to put up candidates 
in the next elections? 
  [Mashhur] Of course, unless they prevent us. 
  [ROSE AL-YUSUF] Some people say that the Labor Party has 
sacrificed the Muslim Brotherhood in order to attend the 
National dialogue meetings. 
  [Mashhur] I do not think this is correct. The alliance 
between us continues. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Wadi' Kirulus] </F>
  [Text] For years the government has turned a blind eye to 
the political and social activities of the Muslim Brotherhood, 
despite being outlawed since 1954. But during the past few 
weeks, there have been increasing signs of a strain in the 
Brotherhood's relationship with the government. 
  The first sign was an anti-government demonstration, in 
protest at the death in police custody of a lawyer 
'Abd-al-Harith Madani, staged by members of the 
Brotherhood-controlled Bar Association and which police 
dispersed immediately. Thirty-six lawyers were arrested. 
  A few days later, Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali, a prominent 
Islamic scholar, was instructed by security authorities not to 
deliver a sermon during prayers marking 'Id al-Adha at the 
Mustafa Mahmud mosque in Muhandisin. Al-Ghazali was later 
received by Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi, in what was viewed 
as a conciliatory gesture. 
  Around the same time, 84-year-old Shaykh Hamid Abu-al-Nasr, 
the supreme guide of the Brotherhood, was summoned for 
questioning by prosecution authorities after leaflets bearing 
his name were seized during the 'Id prayers. The ailing Shaykh 
did not comply and the order was subsequently cancelled. 
  On Monday, Al-Alfi announced that "a group of Brotherhood 
members have been arrested for anti-state activity." The 
newspaper AL- SHA'B, mouthpiece of the Islamist-oriented Labour 
Party, put their number at eight and said their arrest was "part 
of the escalating government campaign against the Brotherhood." 
The eight, who include Ibrahim Sharaf, the private secretary of 
the supreme guide, were remanded in custody for 15 days, the 
newspaper said. 
  Mustafa Mashhur, a deputy of the supreme guide, told 
AL-AHRAM 
WEEKLY he was surprised by the government's actions because "we 
are exercising all our activities, whether in the People's 
Assembly or in professional syndicates or teachers' cubs, within 
the framework of the constitution and under the umbrella of the 
law." He said the Brotherhood has not been involved in any act 
of violence since it resurfaced during the 1970s. "We even 
condemned such acts," he said. 
  The reason for the clampdown, Mashhur said, could be the 
anti- government slogans shouted by lawyers during their 
demonstration. But Mashhur denied that those lawyers were 
Brotherhood members. 
  Another reason, Mashhur said, could be the government's 
intention to deny the Brotherhood the right to establish a 
political party. "They think that if we have an Islamic party, 
the Copts will demand a party of their own and this will lead to 
civil strife. But this is not true." 
  Despite the latest arrests, the Brotherhood is carrying on 
with its normal activities and "will not be involved in any 
escalation, even if the government steps up its measures," 
Mashhur said. 
  'Isam al-'Aryan, secretary-general of the Doctors Union and 
a leading member of the Brotherhood, said he was not worried by 
the latest arrests because "this is a pattern to which previous 
governments resorted on previous occasions." The reason for the 
clampdown, he said, could be a government attempt to bar the 
Brotherhood from the national dialogue or from parliamentary 
elections scheduled for next year. 
  Muhammad Salim al-'Awwa, a lawyer described as a 
representative of the moderate Islamic trend, said he was 
surprised by recent events because the Brotherhood has 
distributed leaflets for years and they were never confiscated 
and the supreme guide was never summoned for questioning. He 
described the government's actions as a "political and religious 
mistake" because the Brotherhood is a "strong political and 
religious supporter of the constitutional system." 
  Political analyst Muhammad Sid-Ahmad believes the motive 
behind the government clampdown is to exclude the Brotherhood 
from the national dialogue. "There are two reasons for this. 
First, the government is not prepared to recognise it to 
prevent the emergence of an Islamic party, then a Christian 
party etc. The second reason is the government's wish to 
maintain the legitimacy of the dialogue" by excluding illegal 
organisations, he said. But Sid-Ahmad believes the Brotherhood 
will be indirectly represented at the dialogue via Ibrahim 
Shukri, leader of the Labour Party. 
  Another political analyst, Tagammu [National Progressive 
Unionist Grouping] secretary-general Rif'at al-Sa'id, who keeps 
a close watch on the Islamist movement, said the government has 
tolerated the Brotherhood for years because it considered it 
harmless but was waking up to its "danger". 
  "There is no moderation in the Islamist current. The 
Brotherhood is an extremist organisation that calls for the 
establishment of an Islamic state. The violent history of the 
Brotherhood speaks for itself," al-Sa'id added. 
  The Brotherhood instigated the lawyers' demonstration to 
cover up for "severe financial malpractices" by the Bar 
Association's Council, he continued. The demonstration as well 
as televised statements by repentant terrorist 'Adil 
'Abd-al-Baqi, implicating the Brotherhood in acts of terrorism, 
made the government wake up to the "danger" of the Brotherhood, 
he commented. 
  Asked if the Brotherhood was expected to retaliate for the 
government clampdown, Al-Sa'id replied negatively. "On the 
contrary, they will kneel down in order to be accepted."

  [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will not 
appoint an envoy to serve as an intermediary between Israel and 
Syria but will continue to handle the negotiations between the 
two countries himself. Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz 
reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Raz] Secretary of State Christopher has 
recently become more active with regard to the negotiations 
between Syria and Israel. There are apparently several reasons 
for this, including domestic ones. The reports, for example, 
that Christopher may be asked to vacate his post are also 
spurring him to make greater efforts. Dennis Ross is not 
exactly popular in Syria, with the end result being both overt 
and covert activity by the secretary of state. Deputy Foreign 
Minister Yosi Beilin is optimistic. He believes that there is a 
wide base for promoting the negotiations between Syria and 
Israel. 
  [Beilin] The United States has been very active with both 
parties on promoting the Syrian-Israeli track over the past few 
weeks since the last round of talks, mainly through telephone 
calls and by using the media. I think that we shall see 
additional process prior to Christopher's impending visit. Any 
progress made, as well as any U.S. involvement, will hopefully 
lead to additional progress because we now have an unprecedented 
basis for negotiations: a readiness by both Syria and Israel to 
talk about peace as well as withdrawal on the Golan Heights, 
together with an acceptance by both sides of U.S. involvement. 
This is a precedent that definitely should be taken advantage 
of. 
  [Raz] What can we deduce from the fact that Christopher has 
decided to handle the negotiations himself for the time being 
and not appoint an envoy as previously intended? 
  [Beilin] I do not know any details about such an intention. 
It is true that the idea of a special envoy to the Middle East 
has been raised on numerous occasions. However, the secretary 
of state apparently decided to continue handling the 
negotiations personally and that is certainly important because 
the more senior the envoy the greater the chances of success. 
  [Raz] Could we witness a breakthrough in the next round of 
talks? Are contacts behind the scenes creating the basis for 
such a breakthrough? 
  [Beilin] I hope so, but I do not think that it is any 
specific round of talks that can lead to a breakthrough. A real 
breakthrough can only come in the wake of ongoing and deeper 
U.S. involvement, which comprises more than just visits of 
senior officials to the region. I think that the secretary of 
state's decision to make a special trip to the Middle East to 
deal with the Syrian-Israeli track and not as the aftermath to a 
visit to Europe or Turkey is symbolic in itself and apparently 
indicates that the United States will now devote separate time 
to our issue. 
  [Raz] Christopher, however, still has a great deal of work 
in store for him. There has been no change in the parties' 
positions. Nothing has actually happened. Syria has still not 
issued a reply to the detailed plan submitted by Israel through 
the Americans. Nevertheless, there is a sense of impending 
developments in the air. [end recording] 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0500 GMT on 8 June in a 
similar report by political correspondent Udi Segal adds that 
"officials in Jerusalem hope that the Americans bring new ideas 
to promote the negotiations and succeed in extracting a few 
answers from Syria's President Hafiz al-Asad regarding the 
Israeli proposals. As for Syria's latest demand that Israel 
abrogate the Golan Law, sources in the prime minister's bureau 
said that would not be necessary because any agreement reached 
between the two countries which contravened the Golan Law would 
have to be approved by the Knesset, thus abrogating the law."]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Dan Margalit: "Syria at the 11th Hour"] </F>
  [Text] Because the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] operation 
against Hizballah was so daring and successful, Israel must show 
that it is really interested in a dialogue with Syria. The 
government assumes that terrorism can be fought without 
silencing the political process, and following the Air Force 
attack, the time has come to test this concept. The problem is 
that even prior to Mustafa al-Dirani's capture and the attack on 
the terrorists in Lebanon's al-Biqa', there were blanks on the 
political radar Jerusalem directed at Damascus. 
  It is true that Yitzhaq Rabin did not promise Husni Mubarak 
that his government would be prepared to withdraw from the 
entire Golan Heights, but he led the Egyptian president to 
believe Israel is ready for such a move. That is a wise and 
dangerous move. It reflects a complex situation for a statesman 
feeling around for an Archimedes level in diplomacy to signal to 
his enemy his willingness to pay a high price for peace, but not 
any price. 
  Rabin can permit such brinkmanship after accumulating with 
Shim'on Peres a lot of credit in the negotiations with the 
Palestinians. Just as Likud leaders know they cannot bring the 
right-wing masses out to demonstrate against an evacuation of 
Gaza and Jericho, they also know that had the prime minister 
proposed a peace accord based on a total withdrawal from the 
Golan Heights the minority coalition in the Knesset would have 
received majority support among the people. 
  Warren Christopher's entourage told Hafiz al-Asad precisely 
that. When he complained about Rabin linking any withdrawal to a 
national referendum, he was told that in their view, the prime 
minister has the power to align a majority for his position. 
Al-Asad silently agreed with that. It seems that the only one 
who cannot gauge the level of credit at his disposal is Rabin 
himself. He sees the situation as made up of both light and 
shade. He is first interested in giving al-Asad the feeling 
that there are no free meals, and therefore Israel will express 
no regrets if Christopher does not make haste to take off in the 
first flight to the Middle East. On that there is full 
coordination between Jerusalem and Washington. 
  That understanding is part of the overall perspective that 
Bill Clinton's administration will not impose a solution on 
Israel, which al-Asad must be convinced of in order to 
understand that the negotiations must be conducted with Rabin 
and Peres. 
  Under those conditions, Jerusalem responds incorrectly by 
emphasizing that Syria lacks a military option against the IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces]. The government believes that Damascus 
has the clout to harass and support terrorism, but not to score 
a strategic victory. Modern history is full of such misguided 
declarations, like those made by Golda Me'ir and Moshe Dayan at 
the time. Rabin and Peres were a part of that team and should 
remember, given their positions in the top leadership. So why 
repeat the mistake? 
  Just like in those bad years, Jerusalem is developing a 
lexicon of dangerous terms to hold up the process. At the time, 
the Israelis aspersed to Henry Kissinger and Joseph Sisco that 
Yasir 'Arafat will never recognize Israel's right to exist, 
therefore there is nobody to talk to on the Palestinian side. 
This was until we heard 'Arafat's famous "caduc," embarrassing 
Jerusalem. Warren Christopher and Dennis Ross are now being 
told that al-Asad is not Anwar al-Sadat. 
  The disparity is as long as the negotiations themselves: The 
Egyptian got things going by stepping off in Jerusalem, and the 
Syrian stays clear of it. Al-Sadat agreed to the withdrawal 
starting without the uprooting of settlements in Sinai, al-Asad 
refuses to hear of such a possibility. What can be done, 
Jerusalem asks with glee, if Damascus refuses to adopt the Camp 
David model? 
  But that is a mistake. One day al-Asad will get up and fully 
adopt the Camp David technique after adapting it geographically 
to the northern border, and Rabin's arguments and Peres' 
diplomatic arrows will become empty cliches in one blow. 
  The prime minister is mistaken in waiting for processes to 
develop in Israel and the Arab world. He and Peres have the 
backing and power to advance the negotiations. Since in my 
view, they have already accepted in their hearts the concept 
that any peace with Syria depends on a full withdrawal from the 
Golan Heights, they will gain almost nothing by sticking to the 
approach that it has no chance of being approved. No delaying 
tactics will lead Damascus to give up part of its territory. 
  The horse trading has to be conducted by sticking in 
principle to the Camp David accords and adapting it to Israel's 
special defense needs in the north. There is also another 
important parallel: Rabin rightly claimed recently that the 
accord with the PLO was completed five minutes before midnight, 
not five minutes after. He just has to continue the parallel: 
Why does the agreement with Syria also have to be made under 
tough conditions? If the initiative and political credit exist, 
then it can be agreed upon at the 11th hour. It is a blatant 
case of the saying: the sooner the better.

<F P=106> [Address by Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres to the Knesset -- </F>
live] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Regarding the letter: I 
have written no letter to 'Arafat. I made no promises to 
'Arafat or to the PLO. I never promised to establish new 
Christian institutes. Since I am certain Knesset Member [MK] 
Matza feels strongly about Jerusalem, I suggest that we do not 
tell the whole world that here in the Knesset there are people 
who are willing to give up on Jerusalem. This is totally 
unfounded. Jerusalem is dear to us all, and I am speaking to MK 
Ze'evi as well. [passage omitted] 
  I would like to describe the Israeli Government stand -- 
past, present, and future -- regarding Jerusalem. According to 
the view, stand, and action of the Israeli Government, Jerusalem 
will not be divided, and we will accept no division of 
Jerusalem. Jerusalem will be no Berlin; no wall will be erected 
in it and it will not be split in two. It will remain united, 
according to the map the Knesset ratified, under Israeli 
sovereignty. It will not be part of the autonomy, and the 
autonomy institutions will not be run from Jerusalem. This is 
our position, and this is the purpose of our struggle. Before I 
start debating with the Likud, I would like to tell MK 'Imanu'el 
Zismann: The problem with Jerusalem is that there are two 
religious worlds that hold Jerusalem sacred -- the Christian and 
the Muslim worlds. I believe we reached a truly historical 
agreement with the Vatican in Jerusalem as it is -- united, 
Israel's capital, under Israeli sovereignty. This kind of event 
takes place once in every 1994 years, and it happened this 
January. Also, we want to tell the Muslims that we have no 
intention of hurting their religious feelings or institutions; 
not theirs, not the Christians', and there is no need to mention 
the Jews because this is our capital. It is self evident. 
  We made a supreme effort to salvage Jerusalem from the 
autonomy, and everything we see is the result of an effort, not 
just a story about how someone tried to fix this, that, or the 
other. We did not want to fix anything. To the best of my 
knowledge -- and I know about this more than anyone -- we came 
up with the idea of Jericho only to avoid the demand that the 
autonomy institutions -- some of which already were in Jerusalem 
-- be placed in Jerusalem. I am very sorry that people here mix 
various political matters together. Not everything is a 
document. When negotiations are held notes, documents, and 
things are exchanged. 
  I would want to tell MK Dan Meridor: There is no question of 
credibility; there is a debate over interpretations. Dan, with 
all due respect, your interpretation is totally unfounded. The 
document does not speak of institutions that will be 
established. As a lawyer and one who speaks of honesty, you 
should be honest. No commitment was made to the PLO or to 
'Arafat. This is an attempt by the opposition to portray the 
government stand in reverse. I do not mind you doing that, only 
it does not bolster Jerusalem. 
  Now I would like to comment on what 'Arafat said, why 
Minister Shahal denied it, and why it is credible. In 
Johannesburg, 'Arafat said that he did not want to sign the 
document in Cairo before he receives a letter about Jerusalem. 
But the letter had existed before Cairo. It was no accident 
that the letter was written to Holst. It was written to Holst 
to tell 'Arafat: You have nothing to do with this. No 
commitment was made to 'Arafat regarding institutions that will 
be established in the future. The letter only describes the 
state of affairs as it was when the letter was written. There 
are thousands of letters in the Foreign Ministry; do you want me 
to disclose them all? This is not a document; this is a letter. 
MK Meridor should know the difference between the two. The 
letter was not written to 'Arafat to avoid establishing a link 
between Jerusalem and 'Arafat. The words PLO or PLO 
institutions do not exist in the letter. It mentions East 
Jerusalem because it does not pertain to the autonomy. You are 
making an attempt to reverse the facts. 
  Now, why Shahal was right. 'Arafat said three things that 
are not true: One, that he did sign in Cairo because he was 
given a letter in Cairo; no letter was given to him in Cairo. 
Two, 'Arafat was given no letter regarding Jerusalem. Third, 
the things that were written to Holst were stated from this 
podium as well. [as heard] [passage omitted] 
  Hence, I hereby determine that nothing was kept secret from 
the Knesset; that nothing was promised to the PLO; that no 
letter was sent to 'Arafat. There is a matter of interpretation 
and I would like to say clear things about this as well. 
Several reporters were offended, and thus they joined those 
charging us with a lack of credibility. There is no credibility 
problem. We spoke the truth. When things were presented to the 
Knesset, there was no such letter. Had there been one, we would 
probably have appended it to the documents despite the fact that 
it is a letter and not a document. This letter was not marked 
secret, confidential, or top secret. It was published as it is. 
[passage omitted] 
  I would like to add one more thing. If the Palestinians 
attempt to establish a political authority beyond that which 
existed when the letter was written, they have no [word 
indistinct] to do so. If they are illegal, they will be canceled. 
  [Passage omitted] With the permission of the speaker, I 
would 
like to opine that the world today is divided along different 
lines than in the past. Almost all matters of importance have 
no boundaries. Almost all of those that have boundaries, their 
boundaries lost much of their importance. What are the 
important things in our world today? Science, technology, 
economy, ecology, and freedom, and they have no boundaries. In 
fact, even strategy today is measured in ballistic boundaries 
more than by geographic borders. 
  Furthermore, as a result of the borders' losing their value 
and the rising value of relations, the three major factors of 
international policy making lost much of their importance. The 
three were political parties, armies, and superpowers. Almost 
all of the events in the past decade took place without the 
three. Russian Communism collapsed not due to military 
operations, the establishment of a party, or superpowers's 
intervention. A communist and television toppled communism. In 
South Africa, a tremendous event took place: The black rights 
were made equal to those of the whites, ending skin color as a 
racist distinction. This was done without superpowers, armies, 
or parties. Peronism was toppled by a Peronist. Here in this 
region as well, most of the work was done without armies, 
superpowers, or parties. 
  I say that there are many conclusions to be drawn from this. 
The question is where Israel is headed? Backwards or forward? 
If Israel wants to move toward the world that has completely 
changed, if we want to buy the correct admission ticket, we need 
bulldozers to move the conservatives among us to see the world 
as it is. 
  I would like to tell the religious MK's sitting in front of 
me: I believe the most difficult struggle for us in the next 
century would be to preserve Israel's tradition and uniqueness. 
It will be no less difficult a struggle than defending our 
borders. To me, the Jewish nation is based on homeland and 
tradition. We must prepare for both, and we will do that with 
the utmost possible stamina. I know that in this ever changing 
world, Israel could not have found its right place had it not 
changed itself. What we did in Jericho and Gaza is a historical 
and realistic enterprise of the first rank which gives Israel 
the necessary fuel to march in this changing world and defend 
our historic values, land, the Jewish nation and the residents 
of Israel. [passage omitted] 
  Mr. Speaker, honorable Knesset: I will now answer the 
query by MK Ya'aqov Shefi [on the relations with the new Italian 
Government]. It is inconceivable for Israel to make compromises 
with fascism, racism, dictatorship, and discrimination of any 
kind. The problem is how one goes about examining this in 
complex cases. How do you distinguish between the policy of a 
government and policies attributed to some of its members? At 
the same time, I would like to say something that is not very 
pleasant. Unfortunately, on more than one occasion in the past 
we were forced to make compromises with these principles. We 
maintained diplomatic relations with a country that professed 
racism in the most formal way, namely apartheid. We had 
relations with countries that were ran by ugly dictatorships 
with cruel murderers at their helm, such as the USSR. I have 
not yet recovered from this. We have very complicated problems 
being the Jewish nation and the State of Israel. I will not 
lie. We are trying hard to observe those principles, but -- and 
not only us -- countries maintain diplomatic relations not 
because they are in love with some other countries, but because 
they believe diplomatic relations would distance the threat and 
pressure that country to change its policy. [passage omitted] 
  As for the question from MK David Magen [regarding the 
possible establishment of a Palestinian state]. Let me tell 
you: The problem was born in the Camp David accords. That was 
the first time the State of Israel gave the Palestinians the 
title of the Palestinian people [last three words in English]. 
When you create a Palestinian people, it is like asking that 
this nation demand a Palestinian state. I would also like to 
say that anyone believing you can hold 120,000 people in prison 
without them crystallizing into a nation is wrong. Had we 
remained in Gaza, the number would have grown even further. 
Therefore, I have been and am opposed to a Palestinian state, I 
am for a Jordanian-Palestinian confederation. I have never made 
my position secret, nor did I ever change it. I am only telling 
you that the first time autonomy was introduced -- full autonomy 
for the Palestinian people and their right requirements [last 10 
words in English] -- it was done in the Camp David accords. Do 
not run away from this. Be honest once and for all. [passage 
omitted] 
  I would like to thank MK Dalya Itzik for her question 
regarding the missiles in North Korea. The United States has 
warned us that one cannot trust North Korea in either word or in 
deed. It said that, considering the U.S. strength and comparing 
it with ours, we should allow it to head the campaign against 
the building of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles and 
selling them to other countries. You are asking me, in terms of 
political logic, who is better suited to head this campaign, the 
United States or Israel. I will tell you, after seriously 
considering the answer, it is better that the United States do 
this. And it does. The United States has now garnered the 
support of the United Nations. This struggle concerns us all, 
and we trust them. We have no reason to doubt the United 
States. We know the U.S. intentions, we see its acts, and I 
welcome everything it does. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Knesset Member [MK] Begin raised the suspicion that 
an excerpt has been omitted from Foreign Minister Peres' letter 
to Norwegian Foreign Minister Holst on the Jerusalem issue. MK 
Begin told Qol Yisra'el that the second clause in the letter 
does not follow from the first clause, and unless this is a mere 
stylistic defect, it is possible that a clause has been omitted. 
  Foreign Minister Peres reacted to this charge by saying that 
no clause has been omitted and the entire letter was published 
verbatim. Mr. Peres added that the Likud people realize that 
the letter does not harm Jerusalem's status in any way 
whatsoever, therefore they pick at it and raise false charges.

  [Text] Rabbi Shlomo Goren [former chief army chaplain] has 
once again published a halakhic edict pertaining to political 
affairs; this time with regard to PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat. 
In his halakhic edict, Rabbi Goren contends that Yasir 'Arafat 
deserves to die according to both Israeli and international law, 
because he has declared a jihad. Our correspondent Gil Litman 
reports that the halakhic ruling is included in a communique 
published by the Committee of Jewish rabbis in Judaea, Samaria, 
and the Gaza Strip.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "From Tunis to Jericho"] </F>
  [Text] Disclosure of the foreign minister's letter to the 
PLO leader through the Norwegian foreign minister contradicts 
the assertions of Yitzhaq Rabin and Shim'on Peres that 
everything pertaining to the Oslo agreement has been put on the 
table and that there are no secret documents. No criticism 
should be spared from the prime minister and the foreign 
minister for not having spoken the truth. Small wonder that now 
we ask ourselves whether all the details of the foreign 
minister's letter to 'Arafat were fully disclosed. In spite of 
our doubts, let us assume for one moment that the letter does 
not contain anything other than a long quote from the foreign 
minister's address to the Knesset on 9 September 1993. If so, 
why did he keep it secret until Yasir 'Arafat disclosed its 
existence and contents? 
  The PLO leader demanded a pledge from Israel that it would 
maintain what he termed the "status quo" in Jerusalem and the 
status of the Palestinian institutions in the city prior to the 
discussions about Jerusalem's permanent status. Peres chose not 
to speak about "Palestinian" institutions, and instead 
elaborated on the freedom of religious worship and Israel's 
willingness to recognize the importance and significance of 
Jerusalem to followers of the monotheistic faiths. 
Nevertheless, it could be inferred from his speech/letter that 
the term "status quo" applies to institutions that have no 
religious or cultural mission; Peres also mentioned "other 
institutions" and the orderly functioning of "the relevant 
institutions and systems." 
  'Arafat's allegation that he signed the Cairo agreement on 
early empowerment of Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and 
in the Jericho area only thanks to the Israeli foreign 
minister's letter concerning Jerusalem leads us to believe that 
he was seeking to guarantee the continued presence of a 
Palestinian political center in Jerusalem; namely, the building 
in the eastern side of the city known as Orient House. Had 
Peres publicized his letter immediately after he sent it there 
might have been no controversy. However, because he kept it 
secret and even denied its existence, the letter is now seen as 
a political concession on the part of Israel. 
  Regardless Israel conceded to the Palestinians when it 
agreed 
in Oslo that the question of Jerusalem would be dealt with in 
the negotiations about the permanent arrangement. Although the 
Israeli delegation extracted the mention of the settlements in 
the same clause of the agreement in exchange -- that is, the 
continued existence of the settlements until the end of the 
negotiations about the permanent arrangement -- the government 
must now defend itself against allegations that it placed the 
unity of Jerusalem as Israel's capital as an open question on 
the negotiating table. 
  Against this background there is room to question whether 
the 
operation of Orient House, as we have known it in recent years, 
is still tolerable. Its contribution as a liaison between the 
Palestinians here and the PLO leadership in Tunis was quite 
limited. The PLO leadership is expected to move to Gaza or 
Jericho, and the Israeli Government does no longer need any 
Palestinian institution as an intermediary. When the PLO 
leadership relocates to Gaza or Jericho, the bunch of 
wheelers-dealers that had to date worked out of Jerusalem will 
lose its stature. 
  The continued and heightened operation of Orient House might 
give the impression that Israel has come to terms with a 
situation in which its tenants are allowed to behave as if they 
were a Palestinian self-rule outside Gaza and Jericho. Israel 
should not agree to the creation of such an image and should 
take action to prevent it. The PLO leadership, with which we 
will have to negotiate an interim and a permanent arrangement, 
should not sit in any part of Jerusalem. As long as it has not 
been agreed otherwise, it can relocate from Tunis to either Gaza 
or Jericho. 
  If 'Arafat sees Peres' letter as corroborating his argument 
that Orient House, at whatever level of political activity, can 
come under the banner "other institutions," the foreign minister 
must alert him to his error.

<F P=106> [Report by Yosi Torpstein] </F>
  [Excerpt] TIPH [Temporary International Presence in 
Hebron] commanders two days ago decided to change the force's 
mode of deployment when there are clashes in the city between 
Palestinian youths and the Israeli security forces. 
  TIPH commanders decided that during future clashes its teams 
will deploy far away from the confrontation sites while 
preserving their ability to monitor events in order to avoid 
involvement in the incidents and to prevent damage to their cars. 
  Based on the agreement between Israel and the PLO, TIPH 
teams 
so far deployed near incidents sites in order to follow events 
closely and report on them. 
  It often happened, however, that TIPH presence caused the 
Palestinian youths to exacerbate the confrontation with the IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] in order to prove to the international 
observers and world public opinion that the Israelis are 
behaving brutally. 
  TIPH spokesman (Bjarno Sorensson) denied that TIPH commander 
Kjell Johannesson is about to ask the Norwegian, Italian, and 
Danish governments -- who supplied the manpower to the force -- 
to withdraw the force from Hebron. "Our situation is difficult, 
but nobody promised us an easy life here, and we will remain. 
If we leave, one side will suffer, and this is the weak side -- 
the Palestinians whom we came to help. We will not turn our 
backs on them just because we have failed to attain our 
objective more quickly," Sorensson said. 
  Palestinian sources in Hebron claim that TIPH's presence in 
the city contributes nothing toward improving the Palestinians' 
situation and protecting them from IDF forces. They claim that 
the observers are obeying the IDF's orders banning them from 
patrolling the city when it is under curfew. 
  The observers are greatly frustrated by the Palestinians' 
claims and by entering situations in which they could be stoned 
or wounded by IDF gunfire. The observers claim that the 
Palestinians are using them for propaganda purposes, whereas the 
IDF is limiting their movement. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Israel will continue supplying the Gaza Strip with 
electricity for the next few months. Autonomy officials asked 
the Electric Company to do so until its own independent source 
of electricity is set up. A ship outfitted with turbines is 
expected to anchor off the coast of Gaza in three to six months, 
providing most of Gaza's electric needs. The Civil 
Administration has paid Israel's Electric Company 40 million 
shekels to cover the Strip's debt.

water in the 'Arava meets the consumption needs of the 
settlements in the area, which amount to approximately 40 
million cubic meters per year. The water commissioner clarified 
that at the Washington talks, Israel will demand that all the 
outstanding water problems with Jordan, including the question 
of the al-Yarmuk River, the Jordan River, and the 'Arava, be

<F P=106> [Report by Muhammad Khalayla] </F>
  [Excerpts] Over the weekend, the Jordanian authorities did 
not allow a delegation of Israeli Arabs from the triangle area 
to visit their country. Twenty-three people joined the 
delegation headed by Jalal Abu-Husayn, Labor's party secretary 
in Baqa al-Gharbiyya. After receiving permission from the 
Israeli authorities to travel to Jordan, the delegation met on 
Jordanian soil with Ratib 'Amr, the minister in charge of the 
occupied territories [name and title as published], who 
allegedly told them that King Husayn and Prince Hasan were out 
of the country. Seeing that you are here to see the king to 
offer him your condolences on the death of his mother there is 
no sense in your visit, 'Amr is said to have told them. [passage 
omitted] 
  It has been learned from sources close to King Husayn in 
East 
Jerusalem that the king actually was in Jordan but decided not 
to grant an audience to the delegation when it transpired that 
they did not represent the Israeli Arab community and were 
affiliated with the Labor party. Furthermore, the sources 
noted, the visit was banned in view of reports on Qol Yisra'el 
in Hebrew and Arabic that the delegation was carrying a 
political message to the king from Israeli government sources. 
  Jalal Abu-Husayn would not say whether he had been bearing a 
political message. Waqf Council sources in East Jerusalem (who 
arranged the visit of previous delegations) made it 
categorically clear that the Jordanian authorities were no 
longer interested in the arrival of condolence delegations 
calling on the king.

Israeli Embassy in Rome was checking the positions of the 
neofascist ministers in the new Italian Government on questions 
related to Jews and anti-Semitism. Peres told the Knesset that 
the policy of the new government should be examined before 
reaching any decisions on the future of relations with Italy. 
Peres added that the deep friendship between the two countries 
must also be taken into account. Foreign Minister Peres will 
meet his Italian counterpart next week to discuss bilateral 
relations.

<F P=106> [Report by tourism affairs correspondent Ilan Shehori] </F>
  [Excerpts] Senior Transportation Ministry officials are 
examining the possibility of abrogating the present aviation 
agreement between Israel and the United States and demanding 
that a new aviation agreement be negotiated with the Americans. 
The sources claim that the conditions of the present agreement 
discriminate against Israel and enable the Americans to carry 
out an unlimited number of flights to Israel. 
  Transportation Minister Yisra'el Qeysar yesterday held an 
emergency meeting after U.S. aviation authorities announced 
their decision to implement sanctions against Israel by 
canceling three weekly El Al flights to the United States 
starting two weeks from today. This will reduce the number of 
weekly El Al flights to the United States from 20 to 17. U.S. 
aviation authorities also plan to ban El Al from flying to 
various destinations inside the United States. 
  The Americans announced their intention to impose sanctions 
against Israel after the Israeli Transportation Ministry refused 
the request of U.S. airline World Airways to hold three regular 
weekly flights on the New York-Tel Aviv line. 
  Qeysar summoned El Al director general Rafi Harlev and the 
heads of the Civil Aviation Administration to the consultation. 
The ministry's legal adviser also attended the meeting. 
  In the meeting, Minister Qeysar sharply criticized the 
manner 
in which Israel was informed about the sanctions against El Al. 
He said that last week a representative of the American airline 
came to his Knesset office, and that even before he was able to 
brief the airline management about his meeting with Qeysar, the 
U.S. Department of Transportation decided to announce sanctions 
against El Al. 
  Following the consultation Qeysar decided to send a letter 
to 
U.S. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena requesting that, in 
accordance with U.S. law, a 30-day extension be granted before 
the sanctions against El Al are implemented. The same law 
states that another 60-day extension is possible before 
sanctions are implemented. [passage omitted] 
  The transportation minister will travel to the United States 
for talks with the U.S. transportation secretary and other 
senior administration officials late this month. In these 
meetings Qeysar will apparently demand that the current 
Israel-American aviation agreement be abrogated. [passage 
omitted] 
  Qeysar said yesterday: "Approximately two weeks ago the U.S. 
transportation secretary and myself agreed that no steps be 
taken against El Al until our meeting in Washington late this 
month, but unfortunately this did not help." 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 1500 GMT on 6 June 
carries a recorded passage of Minister Qeysar answering a 
question about the dispute with World Airways, in which he says 
that "we are now negotiating to find some compromise. We just 
finished a conversation overseas with the representative of 
World Airways, and we are going to reach a compromise. We don't 
want any war with the Americans, because they are our best 
allies. We have no reason to have a conflict with the 
Americans."] [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] The Chamber of Deputies' Foreign Affairs 
Committee, meeting today under the chairmanship of Amin al-Hafiz 
with the participation of 18 deputies and Foreign Minister Faris 
Buwayz, discussed the theft of Lebanese water resources and 
Lebanon's complaints to the UN Security Council over recent 
Israeli assaults. [passage omitted] 
  Minister Buwayz pointed out that Israel uses its military 
forces to carry out assaults to make the resistance feel that it 
is dependent on the protection of the Lebanese and Syrian 
Armies. Consequently, it will seek to attain self-reliance by 
acquiring more weapons, and this will result in confrontation 
between the Army and the resistance. 
  The deputies then debated the issue, and Minister Buwayz 
explained that the Israeli assaults have a larger purpose than 
just influencing the negotiations. He said Lebanon's 
participation in the peace negotiations was approved by several 
successive Lebanese governments and was also an inter-Arab and 
regional decision. He explained that if Lebanon abandons the 
negotiations, it will find itself isolated. Buwayz noted that 
Israel might be seeking to make Lebanon withdraw from the 
negotiations. 
  Concerning the complaints that Lebanon has lodged with the 
UN 
Security Council, Buwayz pointed out that a negative atmosphere 
prevails in that body. He said: The Americans asked us to 
lodge only a complaint. We are not deceived by UN advice. U.S. 
views on this issue must be altered. No one understands our 
issues, and Middle East issues in general, like we do.

  [Text] The cabinet met yesterday and affirmed Lebanon's 
right to confront every aggression committed by the Israeli 
occupation forces. 
  After hearing Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri's report on the 
recent Israeli attacks and the measures taken by the government 
and legitimate authorities to confront these attacks, the 
cabinet said that the aim of the Israeli aggressions is to split 
the internal ranks and harm the homeland's unity. 
  The cabinet, which met under al-Hariri at the government 
house, appraised the national solidarity shown against these 
attacks. It heard a report from Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz 
on the Foreign Ministry's contacts with the major powers and the 
Security Council members to hold a session and adopt a 
resolution condemning Israel. 
  Information Minister Michel Samahah stressed after the 
session that Lebanon is calling on the United Nations to apply 
international law. He said: 
  [Begin Samahah recording] The Lebanese Government's stand is 
very clear. According to international law, the victim and the 
aggressor cannot be put on the same level. Hence, we call on 
the United Nations, as the cabinet clearly said in its statement 
today, to apply its legitimacy, international law, and the UN 
Security Council resolutions to deter Israel from committing its 
aggressions, and to condemn its occupation of Lebanese 
territories in the south and western al-Biqa' and its repeated 
attacks -- as we saw recently, such as the piracies and 
kidnappings and the attacks on the territories lands and 
especially on Lebanese citizens in Lebanon's heartland. [end 
recording] 
  On Israel's theft of Lebanese waters, Minister Samahah said: 
It is no secret that Israel has coveted Lebanese waters since 
its establishment. Lebanon's Foreign Ministry has raised this 
issue in all the arguments over this question. The foreign 
minister sent a message to the UN secretary general earlier this 
week asking him to send an experts committee to inspect the 
al-Litani River waters in the south. 
  Asked whether Prime Minister al-Hariri briefed the cabinet 
on 
his meeting with U.S. Ambassador Mark Hambley, Minister Samahah 
said: The meeting was held as part of the Lebanese efforts and 
contacts held by the president, the prime minister, the foreign 
minister, and the Foreign Ministry departments to hold a 
Security Council session and to adopt a stand that condemns 
Israel's repeated attacks on Lebanon, especially the latest one. 
We have nothing to add with regard to the U.S. stand or to that 
of others.

<F P=106> [Report by Jad al-Akhawi in Jba', southern Lebanon] </F>
  [Excerpts] Here in the town of Jba' in Iqlim al-Tuffah the 
inhabitants are cautious. From time to time they hear the 
sounds of bombs or Israeli reconnaissance planes, which usually 
precede air raids. This is when they rush to their shelters and 
safe rooms. [passage omitted] 
  It has been learned that Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq 
al-Hariri and Hizballah Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah have 
held a telephone conversation in which the need for containing 
the situation and depriving Israel of any pretexts to perpetrate 
new acts of aggression was stressed. It was also learned that 
similar contacts were held between Syrian officials and the 
Hizballah leadership. 
  But according to fundamentalist sources, the resistance will 
continue its operations and a response to the raid near 
Ba'labakk last week must be expected. The sources said the 
visit to Lebanon by Iranian envoy Kazem Khonsari and his 
meetings with Lebanese officials and with resistance leaders 
came as support for the resistance, not to ask it to calm the 
situation and refrain from reacting, as Lebanese papers reported 
today.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hizballah Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah </F>
by Dr. Rif'at Sayyid Ahmad in Beirut; date not given] 
  [Text] [Ahmad] Hizballah's name has been associated with 
martyrdom. How would you describe Hizballah's experiment in the 
past decade through its resistance operations in the south and 
its association with the notion of martyrdom? 
  [Nasrallah] From the start, Hizballah was established as a 
jihad movement, and it operated on this basis. Certainly the 
conditions prevailing at the time of its establishment were very 
hard and tough. The Israeli occupation forces were occupying 
much of the Lebanese territories and were allied with some of 
the right- wing parties. Multinational troops were present in 
Beirut. The Palestinian forces, which had been confronting the 
Israeli enemy, were defeated. Later, the PLO left Lebanon and 
many slogans were abandoned. The only choice left at the time 
was confrontation; confrontation of the hegemony, domination, 
occupation, arrogance, and Israel's legendary aura and of the 
state of frustration, despair, defeat, and capitulation that 
prevailed in Lebanon. A strong shock had to be administered to 
awaken the Lebanese people from their slumber and point to the 
major elements of power inherent in them. We were in need of a 
new method to restore confidence to the people and at the same 
time convince them that the enemy can be defeated. There were 
several accumulated complexes; superiority, weakness, and 
humiliation complexes and the feeling that the other party is 
stronger and undefeatable. In those days, I remember the 
arguments between the young strugglers and those who called 
themselves realists, who thought that our movement was 
unrealistic and illogical; in other words, a movement of crazy 
people!! Today, all of them say that the only realists and 
logical people at the time were us. The most prominent aspect 
of Hizballah movement is the jihad aspect. After three years, 
the movement managed to prove its credibility. So it is not a 
coincidence to see the current massive popular rallying around 
us. During those three years, we managed by means of martyrdom 
operations to force the Israeli troops to withdraw from al-Biqa' 
and Beirut and to keep them confined to the currently occupied 
border zone. The Israelis withdrew unconditionally and without 
any security arrangements. This is because the casualties they 
sustained generated popular pressure inside the Zionist entity 
that led to the withdrawal of the Israelis, after the withdrawal 
of the U.S. and British troops, who knew that they simply could 
not stay longer without suffering casualties. Thus, we believe 
that our jihad experiment has been successful. We also managed 
to identify many sources of strength in our people. We managed 
to stimulate our people. Proof of this is that the resistance 
enjoys popular, official, and partisan support throughout the 
country. Undoubtedly, the resistance operations and martyrs in 
Lebanon have had a major influence in stimulating the 
Palestinians in the occupied territories, and the leaders of the 
Palestinian intifadah admit this. These operations proved that 
the Israeli is weaker than we believe and is not what we imagine 
him to be. The Koran testifies to their cowardice. They are 
too weak to get involved in face-to-face confrontations. We 
believe that this jihad movement, which is still continuing, 
could develop further and could be generalized, and this is what 
we are looking forward to. We want to see this resistance in all 
the cordon states around the Zionist enemy. 
  [Ahmad] With the liberation of all the Lebanese soil, will 
the suicidal performance of the Islamic movement in the south be 
affected or will it continue in various forms until Palestine 
and Jerusalem are liberated? 
  [Nasrallah] In fact this question has been the focus of 
interest in many circles. One thing is clear in all cases. 
When the Israeli enemy withdraws from the Lebanese territories, 
the resistance will stop at that level. As for the rest of the 
question and the types of action, this is premature; the matter 
will be subject to developments and the situations that might 
arise. As far as principles are concerned, we believe that 
Palestine is an occupied land, that Israel is a usurper entity, 
and that the Palestinians are primarily responsible for 
liberating this land. They are entitled to support from all Arab 
and Muslim nations until all the land is liberated. As for how 
and through which methods, this will be determined in time. 
  [Ahmad] This takes us to negotiations, the so-called 
settlement, and the fantasies of the Middle East market. We 
want to hear your views in this matter in general. 
  [Nasrallah] Hizballah has declared its clear and determined 
stand since the invitation to the Madrid conference. We refused 
to take part. In other words, we reject negotiations with the 
Israeli enemy. We believe that the American and Israeli enemies 
want to seize this opportunity to force their plans on the 
entire region. We are going through a stage that lacks 
international and regional balance, after Desert Storm and the 
frustration and despair it created. Therefore, they are trying 
to force the formula or the settlement that suit their 
interests. The American and Israeli enemies are serious about a 
peaceful settlement according to their own terms at this 
particular time, where conditions are favorable. They know very 
well that the future involves many risks and they have to cope 
with that future. But can these negotiations achieve results or 
not? 
  As far as the Palestinian track is concerned, the situation 
is clear. I believe that it is possible to agree on signing the 
details of the Declaration of Principles, because 'Arafat is 
prepared to sign anything. When he took that course, he did not 
do so in order to go back to armed struggle later. He took it 
to finish it to the end whatever the price. The concessions he 
made are unimaginable. Even those who mistrusted 'Arafat to the 
maximum did not expect that many concessions. Through their 
intifadah, the Palestinian people expressed their rejection of 
the Palestinian- Israeli Declaration of Principles. 
  As for the Jordanian track, matters are almost settled; they 
are waiting for the other tracks. The major obstacle lies in 
the Syrian and Lebanese tracks. The Israelis want to reach some 
solution with Syria or Lebanon. But President al-Asad's 
personality and his determination to hold on to the established 
principles he declared-- when the Israelis cannot make real 
concessions--lead me to believe that it is not possible to 
achieve any result on that track. This is at the official 
level. But our own vision is that negotiations-- regardless of 
their results--will not be able to force on the region the 
formula, the shape, or the substance Israel and America are 
pursuing. We are strongly convinced of that and are very 
optimistic about the future. We believe that the people of the 
region will not tolerate coexistence with this imposed formula. 
  At any rate, the Egyptian people have become an example that 
conciliation with Zionists concerns the regimes; there will 
never be a conciliation as far as the people are concerned. 
This is the actual reality after all these years since the Camp 
David Accord was signed. The Egyptian people have not accepted 
normalization or coexistence with the Zionist enemy. This is 
what makes us optimistic. We say that any result reached will 
be limited to the regimes, which will not be able to protect 
that result or force it on the people. 
  [Ahmad] What is your opinion about some Islamist religious 
leaders who have recognized, advocated, and legalized the idea 
of recognizing the Zionist entity? There are some Islamic 
edicts in this regard which appeared in some of our Islamic 
countries (no names mentioned). What is your opinion about this 
matter (the recognition)? 
  [Nasrallah] Historically speaking, there are scholars who 
are known as the court scholars. The scholars under the various 
governments that ruled the Islamic countries in the past were 
divided into three categories: One group adopted the people's 
cause, rejecting the ruler's oppression, tyranny, and injustice. 
The second group supported the ruler, and were called the court 
scholars. This group was also called by Imam Khomeyni the 
sultan's preachers. The third group was impartial and regarded 
what happened as of no concern to it. It is also known that the 
court scholars issued Muslim religious edicts contrary to 
Islamic principles which require that any such edict be rooted 
in the Koran, the Prophet's tradition, or evidence adopted in 
Islamic jurisprudence. History books relate such actions. Such 
scholars cannot deceive anyone. They may at one point mislead 
the simple people. But they are eventually exposed. We 
currently witness such scholars, and we will continue to see 
such types of scholars who are alien to the Islamic awakening. 
  [Ahmad] Let us move on to the Lebanese issue. I have 
recently noticed some changes in Lebanese society. I want to 
ask: Do you see in this the start of Lebanon's revitalization 
or the start of new problems and fresh internal conflicts? 
  [Nasrallah] A series of events have recently taken place, 
some of them devoid of wisdom. Lebanon is almost at the 
threshold of the unknown. For example, the present government 
has adopted several security, media, and political measures. 
These measures have interacted. Some conditions have been 
exploited to push through plans that had been prepared before. 
This is a serious action. The Lebanese understand this easily. 
This government has been working since its establishment to 
change the nature of things in Lebanon. This government cannot 
claim to have established domestic peace. Domestic peace was 
accomplished before, thanks to the direct Syrian effort and the 
agreement of the Lebanese people to support and embrace the 
process of domestic peace. The present government was 
established against the background of domestic peace and a bad 
economic situation. Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri had 
something to do with the bad economic situation through what is 
called the dollar game, the banks, and so forth. This 
government came to change the conditions in a way not so 
familiar to the Lebanese. The prime minister tried in various 
ways to dominate all the media--the press, radios, and 
television stations--by buying some of them and exerting 
pressure on the rest. The government adopted measures on other 
levels, such as banning trade union demonstrations. There was 
also an attempt to control the banks. We, as a movement for 
resisting the occupation, believe that any security measure to 
control the groups cooperating with Israel and its tools is 
perfectly sound. But we are against the exploitation of security 
measures to push through plans pertaining to the media, trade 
union freedoms, and public freedoms in general in order to 
transform Lebanon into an emirate or shaykhdom. 
  [Ahmad] This takes us to the parliamentary experience and 
your assessment of it. Some Islamic movements in other 
countries reject the idea of the parliamentary experience for 
several reasons, including reasons that have to do with 
jurisprudence. What is your assessment of this experience in 
terms of jurisprudence, as well as actually and politically in 
Lebanon, particularly after Hizballah's entry into the 
parliament and its becoming the biggest partisan power in the 
parliament? 
  [Nasrallah] Islamic movements all over the Islamic world 
must 
agree in their goals and principles. But they do not 
necessarily agree in their approach. Every country has its 
unique situation and conditions. For example, the Islamic 
movement in Iran--which led to the revolution and the overthrow 
of the shah's regime--did not adopt the military approach. It 
adopted the popular approach, using strikes, demonstrations, and 
clashes of a popular nature in the street, away from the 
military and security approach. The situation was different in 
Lebanon's case. Under occupation, it is not possible to stage 
demonstrations that inflict harm on the people more than they 
harm the occupiers. Therefore, conditions are unique to each 
country. It follows that Islamists should not be rigid in their 
methods, tactics, and approaches. We have to select the 
legitimate approaches instead of insisting on one rigid approach. 
  We now come to the parliamentary experience. When we entered 
the parliamentary battle, we had a set of objectives and goals. 
We said that participation in the parliament would not change 
the system. This was unprecedented frankness with the Lebanese 
people. Among the goals of participation in the parliament was 
that of solidifying our jihad and political existence. The West 
and arrogant powers tried to picture Islamists in Lebanon as 
security organizations, armed gangsters, and terrorist groups 
that have no intellectual, cultural, or organizational presence. 
They sometimes said that these Islamists were a bunch of 
Iranians who came to Lebanon. We sought elections as a means of 
demonstrating our volume, presence, and scope. Many were 
surprised to find that Hizballah enjoyed all that popularity. 
  On the other hand, we wanted to have a voice in the 
parliament to call for resistance. Our priorities in Lebanon 
are different from other Islamic movements elsewhere. Some 
Islamic movements give priority to overthrowing the regime and 
establishing an Islamic state. Accordingly, they move in that 
direction. We believe that our top and dominant priority is to 
fight Israel, expel the Israeli occupier, and arouse the nation 
to establish a major popular, Islamic resistance that restores 
Jerusalem and rids the nation of that cancerous growth. Hence, 
we are primarily concerned with enhancing efforts in the 
direction of that priority at all the political and legal 
levels. This requires being within an institution that is 
capable of providing some kind of support to the resistance 
movement. Therefore, we endeavored to support the resistance 
after entering the parliament. In that context, we developed 
other objectives, like defending the victims of injustice from 
within the parliament and providing better conditions for our 
people through submitting bills and discussing government plans 
and budget. 
  From the viewpoint of Islamic jurisprudence, our 
participation in the parliament was given deep thought by a 
group of jurisconsults. It was not only a political decision. 
A distinction may be drawn between participation in the 
parliament and participation in an executive authority. The 
parliament is a legislative, not an executive power. It allows 
some sort of political influence on the course of things in 
Lebanon. 
  In the parliament, I can say my mind, oppose, and discuss. I 
can oppose the laws I do not like. I exercise my freedom, and I 
do not have to accept just anything presented to me. In the 
parliament, we discuss and oppose. At the end of the day, we 
may not support this program or that, and then we will not be 
partners to the consequences. In the parliament, I can say, for 
example, that I reject the demolition of these houses, and then 
I spare myself the blame. I also can confront these things in 
the parliament. No one can impose on me anything I do not 
believe in; I express my opinion in full freedom. 
  On the other hand, when I become part of the government, 
that 
is, part of the executive power, I cannot do that because the 
minister, at the end of the day, is committed to the policies of 
the government. The deputy is not committed to the policies of 
the parliament. This means that when the Islamists enter the 
parliament, they are religiously not blamed for any negative 
consequences. 
  Yes, things may sometimes and in certain cases reach a point 
where participation in the parliament may strengthen or cover up 
a serious situation or one that strategically conflicts with the 
objectives and inclinations of the Islamic trend. In this case, 
the deputies may resign and totally exempt themselves from the 
responsibility. But this always needs a study from the 
religious point of view. 
  [Ahmad] Do you see Hizballah playing a role in future 
Lebanese and Arab affairs? What shape and size will this take? 
  [Nasrallah] Generally, we are optimistic about the future of 
the Islamic movement in Lebanon and the region. I even tell the 
Western ambassadors who visit us that the Islamic movement and 
the Islamic awakening in our Islamic world are no longer an 
option, but a fate they must recognize. Hizballah is part of 
this bigger Islamic movement, affecting it and being affected by 
it. There is something like a unified destiny and a unified 
future. On the Lebanese level, we are not worried. On the 
contrary, the movement is growing and developing every day, and 
the line adopted by Hizballah--a jihad and political line--is 
logical and convincing. you will certainly find people in 
Lebanon who disagree with us or reject our thought and 
inclinations, but even these people respect our jihad and 
sacrifices. This is taken for granted. When Hizballah 
Secretary General 'Abbas al-Musawi was martyred--and he was the 
first secretary general or leader of a party or movement to be 
martyred by the Israelis in Lebanon--all Lebanon was shrouded in 
sadness. We are a resistance movement whose leaders, not only 
ordinary fighters, are killed and martyred by the sinful Israeli 
aggression. Contrary to the image that foreign media are 
portraying, we in Lebanon talk about resistance and liberation 
of the land, practice resistance sincerely, and are concerned 
about civil peace. Many people thought that when the government 
in Lebanon tried to strengthen civil peace in the country, it 
would clash with Hizballah. They thought Hizballah would reject 
the moves to cancel armed appearance or abolish some military 
barracks, or that it would not accept certain measures. But 
they were mistaken. 
  In past years, some press analysts used to say a major 
battle between the Lebanese state and Hizballah would break out 
once the first asked the latter to do this or that. These 
analysts were surprised to find that we operate with a different 
mentality. We believe that civil peace in Lebanon is in the 
interest of our people. It is not the authority that matters; 
it is the people. We oppose the authority, but we care about 
our society and our people because we know that going back to 
the civil war in Lebanon would serve Israel's, not the 
resistance's, interests; the interests of the enemies of 
Lebanon, not the people of Lebanon. We are open to all sects, 
trends, and movements present in Lebanon with which we may 
differ in religion, creed, or political ideology. I may even 
claim that we as an Islamic movement are more open to our 
surroundings and to the currents, parties, and personalities 
operating around us than any other movement. Day after day, our 
roots go deeper in the Lebanese ground. I can even add that one 
can find Hizballah's movement in the minds of children. It is no 
longer a movement that belongs to one generation, but several 
generations. Thus, the movement cannot be uprooted by striking 
at its key symbols, figures, or one of its generations. To 
uproot this movement is to strike at several generations, and I 
do not believe anybody could do so to uproot a movement of such 
magnitude. Hizballah is no longer a transitory or unusual 
movement. It is a genuine part of this society; one that goes 
into the people's homes, neighborhoods, cities, and hearts. It 
is a deep- rooted movement that goes deeper and grows more day 
after day. Thus, as far as Lebanon is concerned I do not believe 
we have a problem. I personally am optimistic about the future 
of the Islamic movement, and that of Hizballah precisely, in 
Lebanon. Hizballah's role, and I am not trying to brag about 
myself here because Hizballah's decision is a collective 
decision and Hizballah is not led by a single individual, is a 
thorough and realistic one that takes into consideration all 
circumstances and developments and can face the challenges. 
  As far as the region is concerned, of course Hizballah has 
reached the point of providing a special moral influence. 
Through the contacts we make abroad we realize that to the 
Muslims in the world Hizballah has represented the nation's 
symbol of confrontation against Israel in the past 10 years. 
Unlike their regimes, the Muslim peoples are siding with this 
confrontation. The party that has reflected the ambitions, 
aspirations, and convictions of these peoples in the past 10 
years is Hizballah. Now we have partners, and we are happy 
about this partnership. The Islamic movement in Palestine has 
surfaced and become a major and important symbol in the heart of 
the nation. The fact is that when we see an Islamic movement, 
whether in Palestine or elsewhere, that has adopted the jihad 
course and made considerable progress in it we do not feel sad, 
even if we were to become in the second or third place. On the 
contrary; we actually would see this as a fulfillment of the 
goals we set out to achieve. This is because we are not 
partisans. We have an organization and formations, but we do 
not operate with a partisan mentality. We believe that our 
movement is not serving the goals of a party but of a whole 
nation. Thus, we extend the hand of help and solidarity to any 
faction in this nation, even if we differed or if it were not 
Islamic. We will cooperate with any national or pan-Arab 
faction with a creed different from our Islamic creed or that 
differs from our political line in some details but at the same 
time is ready to confront Israel and the U.S.-Israeli plans of 
hegemony in the same way we would cooperate with any Islamic 
movement. This is because we are aware of this priority and we 
are sincere to this nation. 
  Accordingly, and as part of the optimism of the Islamic 
movement throughout the region, I am optimistic about the future 
of Hizballah. In any case, we believe in the Koranic promise. 
All expectations, prophecies, analyses, and facts indicate that 
our Islamic world, whether the major powers and the ruling 
regimes in our countries like it or not, is the future for the 
Islamic movement. I and many others from our generation may not 
be alive then, but undoubtedly the future will be for this 
movement and its various and successive generations that will 
take charge of our Islamic world's affairs. The Islamic future 
in this region is no longer a choice, but a destiny and a 
predetermined heavenly will, and nobody, God willing, will be 
able to change this.

  [Excerpts] Beirut, Damascus, Washington, AL-HAYAH -- U.S. 
officials have shown some satisfaction with Lebanese 
developments particularly after the main parties concerned 
assured President Clinton's administration that they wished to 
avoid military escalation after the Israeli blows to Hizballah 
and the latter's retaliation. Officials have not ruled out the 
possibility of a lightning tour of the region, especially Syria 
and Israel, by Secretary of State Warren Christopher after the 
NATO meetings in Istanbul next week. [passage omitted] 
  Lebanese Ambassador Dr. Riyad Tabbarah met last Friday with 
Robert Pelletreau, U.S. assistant secretary of state for Near 
Eastern Affairs and his deputy Dan Kirtzer [as published]. It 
has been learned from informed sources that the U.S. side told 
the Lebanese side that "New York is not the right place" to 
discuss the escalation of violence and "the Israeli war" against 
Hizballah, an indication that Washington was not prepared to 
support Beirut's complaint against Israel at the Security 
Council. It repeated that the appropriate place was "the 
negotiating table." [passage omitted] 
  Sources have described the contacts between Ambassador 
Tabbarah and Pelletreau and Kirtzer as being "a frank dialogue" 
particularly in connection with the negative U.S. position on 
Hizballah, portraying it as a threat not only to Israel but also 
to Lebanon, and as a tool in Iran's hand. [passage omitted] 
  Yesterday Damascus denied the existence of an agreement with 
Israel providing for the cessation of national and Islamic 
resistance operations against the Israeli occupation in southern 
Lebanon or that "it made a deal behind the backs of the 
Lebanese." 
  Informed Syrian sources have told AL-HAYAH that "Syria has 
not agreed with the Israelis to stop the firing of Katyushas on 
northern Israel, and denied the existence of any deal under 
which the resistance would only fire Katyushas on the occupied 
strip." They emphasized that Syria "has made no agreements 
behind the back of the Islamic resistance or the Lebanese 
Government, and it cannot possibly become the protector of 
Israeli security," but they pointed out that "the resistance 
does not shell Galilee unless the Israelis attack civilians, as 
happened last July." 
  In Beirut, Lebanese President Ilyas al-Hirawi held 
consultations with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad on the 
political dimensions of the Israeli aggression launched by the 
Israeli Air Force last Thursday on a Hizballah base in the area 
of 'Ayn Kawkab in the Ba'labakk hills. AL-HAYAH has learned 
that the unannounced contacts between the two presidents took 
place last Friday evening and included a general assessment of 
the situation in Lebanon and the region in the light of the 
frozen peace negotiations and the need for cooperation to 
consolidate the internal situation in the face of Israeli 
aggression and not to allow its results to be used as a way of 
undermining national unity. The Lebanese-Syrian contacts 
occurred as Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati was on 
an unscheduled visit to Damascus, prompted by the latest 
developments in Lebanon. 
  As regards reactions to the Israeli raid, the position taken 
by the state in embracing the resistance and declaring a day of 
general mourning for the victims of the aggression to stress 
internal solidarity and control of the situation and prevent any 
negative effects, was welcomed by most Islamic and Christian 
spiritual authorities, and Hizballah was also responsive to it. 
  AL-HAYAH has learned that Hizballah's leadership showed 
appreciation of the delicate situation and did not break the 
official and political consensus. In fact, it has been eager to 
reaffirm its willingness to draw a distinction between its 
position regarding the Israeli raid and response to all the 
efforts aimed at keeping the situation under control. 
  It is noteworthy that, from the first moment of the 
aggression targeting it, Hizballah's leadership acted 
responsibly and overlooked its tense relations with the 
government and its opposition to the government's policy, as 
though it was seeking a new truce on the grounds that the 
priorities at this stage dictated that it should not open old 
files because it felt that that would undermine efforts to close 
ranks in the face of Israeli threats in the absence of any 
international stand and, particularly, of any U.S. stand that 
would deter Israel. This was emphasized by Hizballah's deputies 
at the meeting of the executive and legislative committees of 
the Higher Islamic Shiite Council chaired by its chairman, 
Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi Shams al-Din. 
  The party's leadership has even responded to the efforts 
made 
by Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri from his home in 
Musaylih-al-Nabatiyah, and it quickly tackled the problems which 
occurred between its fighters and some members of the Fijian UN 
contingent in the south, and also stopped firing Katyushas to 
spare the south further hot eruptions. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] The Israeli occupation forces have continued 
their acts of aggression in the south. From 1100 to around 1500 
today, Israeli artillery continuously shelled Kafra, Yatar, 
Haris, Zibqin, Majdal Zun, al-Mansurah, Buyut al-Sayyid, 
al-Hinniyah and the outskirts of al-Qulaylah. This was 
accompanied by heavy machine-gun bursts and continual 
overflights by Israeli warplanes. 
  A correspondent from the NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY reported that 
the villages of the western sector are now experiencing a state 
of economic, educational, and social paralysis as a result of 
the repeated Israeli aggression. 
  Meanwhile, resistance groups carried out a strong attack 
against enemy forces near al-Ahmadiyah in Western al-Biqa'. 
[passage omitted] 
  Hizballah Deputy Secretary General Shaykh Na'im Qasim 
stressed that the al-Ahmadiyah operation today is one in a 
series of attacks in the confrontation with the usurper Israeli 
enemy.

  [Text] Ba'lbakk, Lebanon, June 8 (AFP)--Syrian troops and 
Hizballah guerrillas fired anti-aircraft guns at Israeli 
warplanes but missed as the jets flew over positions of the 
Iranian-backed Hizballah in eastern Lebanon, police said. 
  Seven fighter bombers flew mock raids over the al-Biqa' 
valley villages of al-Nabi Shit and Janta, where Hizballah has 
training camps, police said. Janta is located eight kilometers 
(around five miles) from the border with Syria. 
  Israeli warplanes carried out reconnaissance flights over 
the 
al-Biqa' overnight Monday, less than a week after killing 32 
guerrillas in a devastating raid on a Hizballah training camp in 
the region. 
  Israel mounted the raid less than two weeks after its 
commandos snatched Moslem fundamentalist guerrilla chief 
al-Mustafa Dirani from his home in the al-Biqa' valley to obtain 
information on missing Israeli airman Ron Arad. 
  After the air strike, guerrillas fired katyusha rockets on 
northern Israeli prompting the Jewish state to mass troops on 
its border with Lebanon and to threaten a land operation unless 
the rocketing stopped. 
  Lebanon protested to the United Nations, branding the 
abduction and the raid acts of piracy that violated its 
sovereignty and called for an emergency meeting of the Security 
Council. 
  But US opposition defeated a draft council resolution on 
Monday condemning the Israeli raid. 
  Tension has gripped south Lebanon and dozens of families 
fled 
north fearing an Israeli operation as Beirut, Damascus and 
Tehran discussed ways of preventing any action which could give 
Israel pretext to retaliate. 
  Hizballah, which spearheads anti-Israeli operations in south 
Lebanon, has vowed to avenge the blood of its "martyrs" and said 
the fight with Israel was open on all fronts. 
  On Tuesday guerrillas fired 14 katyusha rockets into 
Israel's 
self-declared "security zone" in south Lebanon, causing neither 
casualties nor damage. Ten rockets fell on the outskirts of 
Marj 'Uyun, headquarters of the Israeli army and its proxy South 
Lebanon Army, in south Lebanon. Hizballah did not claim 
responsibility for the rocketing but said its guerrillas had 
fired around 30 mortar shells at an SLA [South Lebanon Army] 
outpost on the edge of the zone.

<F P=106> [Report by Ahmad Birru from Sanaa] </F>
  [Text] The first cease-fire in the one-month old Yemeni war 
lasted only six hours. Sanaa, which announced a cease-fire as 
of midnight last night, accused the southern forces of breaking 
the cease-fire six hours after it began, according to Foreign 
Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah, by southern Air Force raids 
against the legitimate forces inside Aden and the areas of 
Ma'rib and al-'Abr on the border. The bombing did not result in 
any damage to the oil installations. Gunboats also attacked the 
legitimate forces in (al-'Arish) near the Aden airport. Sanaa 
informed the United Nations, the Arab League, Washington, and 
ambassadors of other states of this violation and asked them not 
to support those who do not abide by international resolutions. 
  Addressing a news conference, the Yemeni minister asserted 
that Sanaa is still prepared to abide by the cease-fire but 
cannot prevent its forces from defending themselves and 
confronting any attack against them. Basindwah said that the 
forces of legitimacy are present in Aden and have the right to 
be in any part of Yemen. Basindwah did not explain if these 
forces has actually entered the city. 
  On the mission of UN envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi, who is expected 
in Sanaa tomorrow, Basindwah voiced his confidence that Ibrahimi 
will deal with the legitimacy, which no longer needs to set 
preconditions because the facts are enough to prove that the 
constitutional legitimacy enjoys support in all parts of Yemen. 
  [Begin Basindwah recording] [Words indistinct] because we 
are 
confident that His Excellency Lakhdar Ibrahimi, envoy of the UN 
secretary general, will deal with the constitutional legitimacy 
[word indistinct] in the Yemeni Republic. Of course we no 
longer need to set preconditions because the facts are enough to 
prove that constitutional legitimacy enjoys support everywhere 
in Yemen. The [word indistinct] by the UN Security Council 
resolution and the immediate cease-fire. This proves our good 
intentions toward international legitimacy and our concern to 
respect its resolutions. However, this does not mean that we 
will deal with the insurgents after the ruin, destruction, and 
bloodshed they caused. This also does not mean that we will 
accept that anyone comes here and talks with us or to us about 
dismembering Yemen. This is impossible. [end recording] 
  He also said that the role of the UN envoy will not be at 
the 
expense of Yemeni unity in any case and that we will not accept 
anyone coming here and talking with us about dismembering Yemen. 
He said Sanaa's announcement of an immediate cease-fire is 
proof of respect for international legitimacy and abidance by 
its resolutions. 
  Asked by Radio Monte Carlo if there is dialogue with certain 
Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leaders, the Yemeni minister said: 
There are YSP leaders even inside Sanaa and dialogue with them 
is being held. These leaders still hold their positions. There 
are also elements in Aden and Hadhramaut that we could not talk 
to in the past despite their readiness for dialogue. 
  Asked if there were definite contacts, the minister said 
that 
he could not reveal if there were contacts of this kind. He 
also refused to give any explanations on the external assistance 
that the southern leaders might have obtained or name the side 
extending this assistance to them.

<F P=106> [Report by Hasan Zaytuni from Sanaa] </F>
  [Text] Hours after a cease-fire was declared, Sanaa accused 
southern forces of violating it and attacking government forces 
in Aden's al-'Arish District. The southern Air Force raided oil 
installations in the northern Ma'rib and al-'Abr areas to the 
northwest of Hadramaut. 
  Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah confirmed 
this information during a news conference he held at the Yemeni 
Foreign Ministry today. On the sidelines of the news 
conference, Basindwah spoke to the MBC, declaring that his 
country wishes to strengthen its relations with fraternal 
countries, particularly Saudi Arabia. 
  [Begin recording] [Basindwah] As an Arab citizen, not Yemeni 
foreign minister, I would like all the brothers to understand 
that their current position might not serve their future 
interests. 
  [Zaytuni] Minister, a UN envoy will shortly arrive in Sanaa. 
Does Sanaa have conditions to present to him? How will Sanaa 
deal with the UN envoy in light of current domestic and 
international developments connected with the Yemeni crisis? 
  [Basindwah] We welcome his excellency brother Lakhdar 
Ibrahimi as an envoy of the UN secretary general. We are 
confident of his competence, ability, wisdom, and long 
experience. I believe that any mediation effort must respect 
the need to preserve Yemeni unity. [end recording] 
  The Yemeni Foreign Ministry declared its willingness to work 
with the UN envoy without setting any conditions that might 
hinder his peace mission. The Ministry insisted, however, that 
the two principles of Yemeni unity and constitutional legality 
be maintained.

  [Text] Brother Lakhdar Ibrahimi, envoy of the UN secretary 
general, arrived in Sanaa this afternoon on a working visit to 
our country, during which he will meet with the brother 
officials in order to be closely acquainted with the current 
developments in the Republic of Yemen. 
  In an arrival statement to the Yemeni News Agency, SABA', 
the 
UN envoy expressed his great appreciation for the responsibility 
entrusted to him in order to carry out this historic mission. 
He added: I take pride in the UN secretary general's 
assignment of this mission to me and by the unanimous support 
this nomination was met with in the Security Council, in 
addition to the Yemeni brothers' welcome of my appointment to 
his mission. Ibrahimi added: I am looking forward to the help 
and assistance of my brothers in this country to perform this 
mission. He went on to say: Dialogue should be restored among 
the brothers and the Yemeni people's love for their country is 
well known. We are looking forward to their cooperation with 
each other and with us in order to return Yemen to its previous 
known march. 
  Concluding, Ibrahimi said: I will not answer questions at 
this stage until we meet with the brother officials and agree 
with them on the way to work together. 
  He was received at the airport by brother Ahmad Dayfallah 
al-'Uzayb, Foreign Ministry under secretary for political 
affairs; Ambassador 'Abdallah al-Uhadi, chief of protocol at the 
Foreign Ministry; a representative of the Presidential Council 
protocol; Dr. 'Awni al-'Ani, UN representative in our country;

  [Text] Qatari Television last night carried an interview 
with Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani, member of the Presidential 
Council. In the interview al-Zandani expressed the Yemeni 
people's appreciation for the State of Qatar and the brotherly 
people who proved that they support the right, principles, and 
unity of Yemen. He said the Yemeni people will never forget this 
noble and fraternal position of our brothers in Qatar. 
  The brother Presidential Council member said that countries 
which respect their pledges and agreements, maintain their 
credibility, and are eager to preserve security and peace are 
the ones that supported Yemeni unity, and continue to adopt the 
same position. 
  On the allegations that what is going on in Yemen is a 
sectarian conflict, Shaykh al-Zandani explained that the Yemenis 
are one people with one religion, and that there are no sects in 
Yemen. He said our people lived under the brotherhood of Islam 
for more than 1,000 years and that colonialism was responsible 
for dividing the country. As for the sectarian or racial calls, 
they have been incited by the secessionists in the Socialist 
Party with the aim of dismantling the unity of the Yemeni people. 
  He said we consider these calls as having foreign political 
motives and that they are paid for in order to terminate unity, 
but the secessionists only reaped disappointment. Our Yemeni 
people and all their groups and governorates are standing 
against the clique that rebelled against our people and carried 
weapons in their faces to incite a rift. 
  On the Security Council resolution, he said the government 
appreciates the resolution and announced that it will deal with 
the resolution in a positive manner, and will cooperate with the 
international envoy and the fact-finding mission. He said we 
are satisfied because the Security Council resolution has 
tackled the problem as a united political entity that is the 
Republic of Yemen, and we hope that the United Nations will be 
able to understand what is going on in Yemen.

  [Text] Brother 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, Presidential 
Council chairman, has stressed our country's concern to 
implement the UN Security Council resolution on the situation in 
Yemen. In this regard, he noted that our country has from the 
very beginning announced that it will abide by UN Security 
Council Resolution 924 which was issued on Wednesday [1 June]. 
  In a telephone interview with Voice of America the day 
before 
yesterday, brother 'Abd-al-Ghani said the Republic of Yemen 
regrets the position of certain Arab states toward the situation 
in Yemen. He stressed that the statement issued at the 
conclusion of the meetings of the Gulf Cooperation Council 
foreign ministers is considered an interference in Yemeni 
internal affairs. 'Abd-al-Ghani praised the position adopted by 
the fraternal State of Qatar rejecting this statement that 
failed to mention the Yemeni unity, which was underlined by the 
UN Security Council resolution. 
  In his interview with Voice of America, 'Abd-al-'Aziz 
'Abd-al-Ghani strongly denied that the Yemeni Air Force planes 
have raided Aden refinery. He said such refineries are the 
property of the Yemeni people and the government cannot destroy 
its own installations. He also stressed that the forces of 
constitutional legitimacy are concerned not to attack any 
position close to any vital installation in the country. He 
stressed that the forces of constitutional legitimacy have 
always taken care not to hit Salah-al-Din Camp, which is 
adjacent to the refinery, despite the fact that devastating Scud 
missiles -- which left behind innocent victims and material 
damage in the civilian neighborhoods where they fell -- were 
being fired from that camp. He underlined the secessionist 
elements' responsibility in hitting the Aden refinery to create 
among the Yemeni people in Aden some kind of bitterness.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by "a responsible source" at the GPC </F>
General Committee] 
  [Text] The GPC's [General People's Congress] Standing 
Committee has learned that the security agencies affiliated with 
the gang of apostasy and secession in Aden have in the past few 
days made collective arrests of many leaders and members of the 
GPC branch in Aden, the economic and trade capital of the unity 
state, which is now controlled by the gang of those who rebelled 
against unity, democracy, and constitutional legitimacy, and 
threw them in jails. 
  Information confirms that the security agencies of the rebel 
gang raided houses of the GPC members on the pretext of 
searching for weapons before arresting them and taking them to 
detention centers. 
  Reliable sources said these security agencies did not inform 
the families of some GPC members that they were detained. Other 
information says the detainees were subjected to psychological 
and physical torture at the hands of experts in torture after 
they had refused to sign a statement supporting al-Bid's 
declaration of secession. 
  The GPC Standing Committee is astonished by this criminal 
conduct. It holds the criminal gang fully responsible for what 
may happen to the detainees at the hands of their henchmen and 
calls for their immediate release. The Standing Committee urges 
all political parties and organizations and the popular 
institutions and organizations to denounce this cowardly act, 
which was carried out by the elements of apostasy and secession 
in the Socialist Party. Having failed to face the valiant forces 
of unity and constitutional legitimacy, these elements seek to 
take revenge from the innocent civilians, including members of 
our organization. 
  We also draw attention to the fact that these criminal, 
suppressive acts carried out by the elements of rebellion and 
secession in the Socialist Party expose the rigid totalitarian 
mentality, the tyrannical suppressive will, and the 
conspiratorial policies that still live at the minds of the 
enemies of democracy, human rights, and civil liberties; and who 
do not respect other opinions. These acts are yet another 
addition to the series of crimes committed by this gang against 
our people and will not go unpunished.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by "a responsible source in the Defense </F>
Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Yemen; date not given] 
  [Text] At a time when the media of the ruling military 
regime in Sanaa and its foreign minister, Muhammad Salim 
Basindwah, are putting out statements to the effect that this 
regime is observing the cease-fire, the forces of this 
treacherous and adventurist regime mounted an aggressive attack 
at 0300 today. 
  Our heroic Armed Forces of the (?inner) Hadramawt axis 
repulsed this new act of aggression with rare courage, 
inflicting crushing blows on the enemy forces and causing them 
heavy losses in life and materiel. Our forces captured eight 
enemy [word indistinct] vehicles. At 1100 today our air 
defenses shot down one enemy MiG-21 fighter aircraft beyond the 
(al-Asalin) Heights. At 1530 today the enemy was forced to 
retreat. Our forces are currently in pursuit and mopping up 
remaining pockets of the enemy. God is great.

  [Text] An official source in the Democratic Republic of 
Yemen [DRY] affirmed that the Sanaa ruling regime and its head, 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, did not abide by the cease-fire as 
announced by it last night. The source indicated at 1130 last 
night information was picked up confirming that military 
reinforcements had come from Ta'izz to his forces and at 1216 
minutes [as heard] a call was picked up while ordering the Sanaa 
regime's forces in their first axis to advance on Aden. The 
source affirmed that there is a recording of the voice of 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih who was ordering his defense minister to 
continue the war. The order was carried out, but our forces 
repelled them and dealt killing blows to them.

  [Text] The news agencies yesterday evening circulated the 
statement of the minister of foreign affairs of the ruling 
military regime in Sanaa, Muhammad Salim Basindwah, in which he 
announced that his government will commit itself to the 
cease-fire with effect from midnight yesterday. The Democratic 
Republic of Yemen [DRY], which for its part announced its full 
commitment to the UN Security Council resolution which was 
issued last Wednesday [1 June], is also ready to satisfy [words 
indistinct]. As for the ruling military regime in Sanaa, it 
issued this announcement as a new lie and a political maneuver, 
the target of which is to hypnotize the world community and to 
absorb the Arab and world's anger for its defiance of the UN 
Security Council resolution and all the Arab and international 
efforts, the last of which was the American warning and the 
Egyptian communique. 
  Since midnight last night the ruling military regime in 
Sanaa 
has ordered its forces to launch a total and wide-scale attack 
on all fronts. In other words, it considered the time fixed as 
a cease-fire deadline, which deluded the public opinion, as a 
zero hour for the wild, total, and hostile attacks against our 
people in the DRY. Thus, this adventurous military regime 
continues its flagrant defiance of the world community and at 
the same time releases news to the outside world about its 
acceptance of the cease-fire. 
  The DRY, which was and is still ready for an immediate 
cease-fire since the UN Security Council's resolution was issued 
last Wednesday, finds itself compelled to defend itself in front 
of a brutal enemy who has been waging this criminal war for 44 
days running, amid local, Arab and international objections and 
on the debris of the skulls of thousands of the sons of our 
people as well as the destruction of cities, villages, and vital 
economic installations.

  [Text] Mr. 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the chairman of the 
Presidential Council, said that stopping the war is the thing 
that stops danger. As long as there is a war existing there are 
dangers existent and the main loser is the Yemeni people. He 
clarified that our infrastructure is subjected to destruction 
and that those who are imposing war on us now have no cause, 
emphasizing that we have a cause for which we are struggling and 
that we are owners of the right. This came in a press interview 
held by the AL-KHALIJ newspaper of the United Arab Emirates with 
Mr. 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the chairman of the Presidential Council, 
and published in its issue dated 5 June. 
  He clarified that what is going on in Yemen today is not a 
Yemeni issue only. The project that collided with the unity 
project and spoiled it is another project connected to many 
projects and how can we explain that Iran was displeased by the 
UN Security Council's resolution concerning Yemen? He added 
that the issue now is the issue of the Gulf states, the 
stability of the people, and the interests of these countries. 
Mr. 'Ali Salim al-Bid went on to say: The others are trying to 
impose the Gulf crisis on us, but [words indistinct] its 
expansion to another region in the south of the Arabian 
Peninsula. 
  In his reply to a question about published information 
mentioning that there are Jordanian airplanes which are 
providing Sanaa with weapons and ammunition, Mr. 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid said: Yes, there is information about this matter. In 
the beginning I did not believe it, but when we followed up the 
matter we got sure about it. I did not expect this stand from 
Jordan. It is me who went to King Husayn to help us in reaching 
a solution and mediation. I had not expected this. I had not 
wanted King Husayn's stand to be heard, but this is their state 
policy. This is their own concern. 
  About the relations of the Democratic Republic of Yemen with 
the member countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council, the 
chairman of the Presidential Council said: We created here a 
state which wants stability. I consider it in the first defense 
line of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries. We are seeking 
stability and he who seeks stability continues as a defense line 
for all those who seek stability anywhere.

<F P=106> [Interview with 'Ali Salim al-Bid, "president of the </F>
Democratic Republic of Yemen," in al-Mukalla, by Nichole 
Tannuri, in London, on 7 June -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Tannuri] 'Ali Salim al-Bid, president of the 
Democratic Republic of Yemen, told MBC Television this evening 
via satellite from his current headquarters in al-Mukalla, 
Hadhramaut, that talks should take place after the war stops and 
that they could address all issues. He welcomed the mission of 
special UN envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi. He said that he will not set 
any preconditions or make any prerequisites so that Ibrahimi's 
mission is not fraught with obstacles. 
  We asked al-Bid at the beginning of our meeting with him 
about the latest developments in the military situation. 
  [Begin recording] [Al-Bid] The military situation: I believe 
it is well-known now that there are many battles raging around 
Aden. There are also battles raging on the Hadhramaut and 
Shabwah fronts. But there is also mythical heroism from our 
people. 
  [Tannuri] What are the factors for the success of the 
mission of UN envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi, in your opinion? 
  [Al-Bid] We welcome Lakhdar Ibrahimi in his capacity as the 
envoy of the UN secretary general and as an Arab brother with a 
respectable position and experience in the Arab homeland. I 
also believe that he will find us cooperating with him. We are 
confident that he is the man for such a mission. 
  [Tannuri] Is it possible to return to the subject of unity 
once again? 
  [Al-Bid] All issues are open for discussion. We declared the 
Democratic Republic of Yemen. The bases on which this republic 
is established are known. The important thing now is to talk 
about stopping the fighting. We can then discuss any other 
topic. 
  [Tannuri] How did you receive the Gulf Cooperation Council 
[GCC] statement regarding Yemen? 
  [Al-Bid] We believe that this is the result of the status 
quo. Our relations with the GCC and with all the Arab countries 
and the rest of the world are old relations going back a quarter 
of a century. The transitional period during which we earnestly 
tried to move toward unity is a period of a break in relations 
that was not successful as a result of obstacles imposed by the 
kind of thinking that interprets unity as control and hegemony. 
It was a period of our estrangement from the rest of the world. 
However, we believe that the statement is a good statement. We 
expect more serious steps to be taken after this. [end

<F P=106> [Interview with 'Ali Salim al-Bid, "president of the </F>
Democratic Republic of Yemen," in Hadhramout, by Nichole 
Tannuri, in London, on 7 June -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Tannuri] What is the truth 
behind the Iraqi and Sudanese military assistance to north Yemen? 
  [Al-Bid] I believe that there is an attempt to reenact the 
Gulf crisis in the Arabian Peninsula. There was an attempt to 
let this crisis drag on after it had been contained in order to 
drown the region in tension and instability. Some states have 
clearly declared their stand. We hope they will not go too far 
in dragging the area into more instability and destruction. 
  [Tannuri] Do you need military support and do you get any 
such support from abroad? 
  [Al-Bid] Any man who fights needs certain capabilities. We 
are defending ourselves with what we have. We will make every 
possible sacrifice to defend ourselves at any price. We taught 
the retreating invaders unforgettable lessons. They realized 
that in the areas they tried to invade and in courageous Aden. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Tannuri] Do you expect Arab and foreign states to recognize 
your republic or does that recognition depend on the United 
Nations? 
  [Al-Bid] We believe that charity begins at home. Our people 
in Arab and Muslim states come first. I believe that the world 
now knows what is happening in Yemen -- there is a conflict and 
a cause. The proclamation of the Democratic Republic of Yemen 
was based on principles I believe will be approved and backed by 
many Arab, Muslim, and world states. 
  [Tannuri] Analysts believe that the south sought secession 
when it turned out that most oil reserves were in the southern 
parts of the country. 
  [Al-Bid] We knew about the oil before unity. We had 
sufficient information. But oil never dissuaded us from seeking 
unity. The oil is not new. What hindered the march toward 
unity was the emergence of another venture that conflicted with 
unity, whether Yemeni or collective Arab democratic unity. On 
the one hand, there is an alliance between the mentality of the 
military and the al- Ahmar [reference to Parliamentary Speaker 
Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar] family gang and on the other there is 
the fundamentalists who want to take the Arab nation to the 
middle ages. We in Yemen and many parts of the Arab homeland 
want to enter the 21st century with the entire world. 
  A last word. I hope the crisis that befell the Yemeni people 
will stop at is current level. It is the Yemeni people and not 
the advocates of war who are losing. I hope the United Nations 
and international legitimacy will live up to their 
responsibility to restrict that arrogant mentality by which 
Sanaa rulers seek to force their will on the people. They are 
bombarding areas of Aden indiscriminately and are trying to 
destroy the economy and its foundations. The latest crime they 
committed was shelling Aden's oil refinery twice. They are 
still trying to do that. I hope reason will triumph. I also 
hope capable states will succeed in putting an end to this. We 
made contacts with all parties concerned. I believe they are 
capable of ending this tragedy. What is taking place on the 
ground must be monitored. Our task right now is to put an end 
to the catastrophe by first observing a cease-fire and then 
discussing future issues. 
  [Tannuri] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Interview with "South Yemen Prime Minister" Haydar Abu-Bakr </F>
al-'Attas by Sawsan Abu-Husayn in Cairo; date not given] 
  [Text] [Abu-Husayn] Sanaa has announced its commitment to 
halting the fighting since the adoption of the Security Council 
resolution. In fact military operations have escalated. What 
is the situation and how do you view it? 
  [Al-'Attas] On my arrival in Cairo I received a report from 
Aden on a telephone conversation intercepted between President 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and commanders of the military units, in 
which he literally says: "The military situation must be 
settled within 14 hours." So he wants to occupy Aden. And he 
is currently hitting strategic installations and civilian 
installations. In contrast, the Democratic Republic of Yemen 
[DRY] has announced its acceptance of the cease-fire and 
committed itself to implementing it. So northern forces have 
exploited the situation and begun to launch their attacks on 
vital facilities. As is known, they have shelled oil refineries 
in the south, in addition to the extensive artillery bombardment 
of residential areas to kill more people and abort the 
resistance in the DRY. 
  The present military situation is a serious escalation. I 
openly declare that Sanaa is resorting to evasion even in the 
statement issued by it. This statement does not offer open and 
clear acceptance of the Security Council resolution. They are 
always lying. We believe that this lying to the international 
community will result in very disastrous consequences. 
  [Abu-Husayn] In your view, can northern forces occupy Aden 
within 14 hours on orders from the general command of the units 
on the various fronts? 
  [Al-'Attas] I say this from a position of confidence: Let 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih himself and the world around him be assured 
that Aden will not fall, nor will he occupy it. Aden fighters 
will struggle to defend it. I admit that Aden could suffer 
heavily and be exposed to destruction, but it will not fall into 
the north's hands. We say to the international community that 
the DRY has complied and implemented the cease-fire. But the 
north has exploited the situation and is trying to occupy, and 
we are now in a position of defense. 
  [Abu-Husayn] Have you requested international forces from 
the United Nations to protect Aden? 
  [Al-'Attas] Yes, we requested that early on, as we know the 
intentions of the north. And now the Security Council is 
responsible for implementing its resolution. We informed the 
Security Council the day before yesterday of the military 
escalation by Sanaa. We have also briefed the United States and 
all the parties exerting efforts to halt the fighting on 
developments in the situation. 
  [Abu-Husayn] With the arrival of UN envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi 
in Yemen, do you expect the fighting to be halted? 
  [Al-'Attas] We hope so, and once Sanaa complies, we will end 
the state of defense. 
  [Abu-Husayn] Do you have specific demands for Lakhdar 
Ibrahimi? 
  [Al-'Attas] Our demands are known. They are summed up as 
follows: First, a halt to the fighting. Second, send 
international forces to disengage the forces. Then we would 
continue to implement the Security Council resolution without 
any reservations or conditions. We are willing to engage in a 
dialogue, negotiations, and anything else except the imposition 
of unity by force of arms or the wish to achieve personal 
interests for a partisan alliance, as is currently happening 
between the [General People's] Congress and the [Yemeni] Reform 
Grouping in the north. 
  [Abu-Husayn] How do you view the positions of Britain and 
France on safeguarding Yemen's unity and nonrecognition of the 
new state? 
  [Al-'Attas] We have made contacts with them. They support 
the Security Council resolution, to which all states, including 
the DRY, have agreed. 
  [Abu-Husayn] Are you thinking of visiting a number of Arab 
capitals? What about the results of your visits to the Kingdom 
of Saudi Arabia and Egypt? 
  [Al-'Attas] They were very good. They were designed to 
exert all efforts and pressures to halt the ongoing war. I also 
intend to visit a number of Arab capitals. Especially as the 
military escalation by Sanaa is exposing the region to great 
dangers. Because the war is currently taking place on the 
borders of some fraternal countries, as in the northern area in 
Shabwah. At the least, the result is the emigration of huge 
numbers of homeless people and victims of war. 
  [Abu-Husayn] Foreign ministers of the Gulf Cooperation 
Council [GCC] issued a statement tacitly recognizing the DRY. 
What is your opinion? 
  [Al-'Attas] We welcome the statement issued by the GCC 
foreign ministers. We consider it a good start for establishing 
distinct and special relations. We also thank them for their 
supportive and strong stands aimed at securing a cease-fire. 
They must be given the credit for their resolution, which is 
nothing but the voice of reason. Because unity cannot be 
imposed by force of arms. Besides, reason prompts us all -- 
including Sanaa -- to respond to the Security Council 
resolutions in order to safeguard what is left of Yemen and to 
safeguard the region's security and future. 
  And finally, we must thank all the Gulf states, as well as 
Egypt, Syria, and Morocco, for their courageous stands regarding 
safeguarding Yemen's unity and their eagerness to spare it 
destruction -- something President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has not 
done. 
  [Abu-Husayn] How do you view the present U.S. position? 
  [Al-'Attas] The U.S. position is similar to ours. It 
supports the Security Council resolution, a halt to the 
fighting, and the call for a dialogue. We welcome that. The 
question of recognition is a formal matter, because we were a 
state in the past, and all is needed now is restore the 
situation to its previous status.

  [Text] Mr. Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, the prime minister, 
arrived in Abu-Dhabi today from Cairo after a two-day visit to 
Egypt. Mr. al-'Attas had met in Cairo with the Egyptian 
president, Muhammad Husni Mubarak, and held talks with the 
Egyptian officials on the current situation in Yemen. 
  In a press conference, the prime minister said that while 
democratic Yemen announced its preparedness to receive the 
fact-finding commission and to cooperate with it and facilitate 
its mission in order to achieve peace in Yemen and resort to 
dialogue, the Sanaa regime refused to comply with the Security 
Council [resolution] and the advice of the Arab leaders, among 
them President Muhammad Husni Mubarak of Egypt, Shaykh Zayid Bin 
Sultan Al Nuhayyan of the United Arab Emirates, King Fahd 
Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, king of Saudi Arabia, and the Syrian 
president, Hafiz al-Asad. He added that the Sanaa regime had 
(?accepted) conditional agreement on cease-fire and then broke 
it up on weak excuses. This proves that there is open 
contradiction in the decision making circle there. 
  He affirmed that the situation in the last 48 hours had 
witnessed a dangerous escalation. The Sanaa regime used in its 
attacks all destructive weapons, including rockets and 
long-range heavy artillery. He indicated that the residential 
quarters and utilities had been the targets of the rockets and 
warplane missiles. Al-'Attas described the shelling of Aden 
refinery as a sign of the times. He said that this operation 
had shocked the Arab and world public opinion.

  [Text] Al-Dammam, 8 Jun (WAKH) -- [Former Yemeni Prime 
Minister] Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas has announced that 
his country will ask the Sanaa government to pay war 
reparations. He said that the northern Yemeni troops have 
damaged the infrastructure in south Yemen and made thousands of 
Yemenis homeless. 
  In a statement to the Saudi newspaper AL-YAWM published 
today, al-'Attas expressed total amazement over the announced 
number of losses among the northern troops, which was put at 
613. Al-'Attas wondered whether this figure can be reasonable 
[words indistinct], given the use of various kinds of mass 
destruction weapons. 
  Al-'Attas welcomed the final statement issued by the 
Ministerial Council of the Gulf Cooperation Council, saying that 
this statement reflects the GCC members' eagerness to safeguard 
the security and safety of the Yemeni people in particular, and 
those of the region in general. 
  Al-'Attas affirmed that Sanaa has no control over the 
cease-fire decision [la tamluk qarar waqf itlaq al-nar]. That 
is why it has procrastinated over the implementation of the UN 
Security Council resolution, which demanded an immediate 
cease-fire, and failed to honor it since it was announced the 
evening before last. 
  Al-'Attas noted that the international recognition of the 
Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY] will make Sanaa observe a 
cease-fire. 
  He added that some 60,000 persons have been killed, while 
the 
number of people made homeless has exceeded 100,000.

  [Excerpt] Brother Muhsin Bin-Muhammad Bin-Farid, deputy 
prime minister and minister of planning and development, has 
said that defending the homeland is a life and death issue. He 
said that preparations were actively being made for a 
counterattack on the various fronts. In an interview for the 
Kuwaiti AL-SIYASAH, the minister stressed that the sons of the 
Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY] were prepared and fully 
determined to regain all their territory and to drive out the 
aggressive invaders from the gang of the al-Ahmar clan. He said 
there were thousands of the sons of the Shabwah and Hadramawt 
Governorates who were going to the fronts and performing battle 
feats as part of their sacred duty to defend the homeland. They 
were fighting with high morale because they had a just cause. 
  He noted that the citizens had [word indistinct] well and 
had 
expressed their joy at the declaration of the establishment of 
the DRY as constituting a fundamental change in their political, 
economic, and social life and a strong factor for changing the 
political and military balance in south Yemen in general.

<F P=106> [Interview with Brigadier General Haytham Qasim Tahir, </F>
"South Yemen's defense minister," in "his office at the Defense 
Ministry in Aden," by Zaki Shihab; date not given] 
  [Text] [Shihab] How do you assess the military situation 
on the fronts four weeks after the start of the fighting? 
  [Tahir] You know well that this all-out war in our country 
started, in effect, on 27 April 1994 with President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih's famous speech in which he declared war. Less 
than two hours after that speech, the 3d Armored Brigade, one of 
the brigades we moved to the northern governorates immediately 
after unity, was attacked. A few days later, the Ba Suhayb 
Brigade came under a treacherous attack in Dhamar. 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih then pushed his troops on various fronts, 
including Qa'tabah, al-Dali', al-Rahidah, Kirsh, al-Bayda', 
Mukayris, and Hurayb-Bayhan, and Bab el-Mandeb-Kharaz; that is, 
on the borders between the former North and South Yemens. 
Battles continue now for the fourth consecutive week. This 
war, which started in effect on 27 April, was prepared and 
planned in advance and many rehearsals were made. On the eve of 
signing the "Pledge and Accord Document" in Amman on 21 
February, units from the al-'Amaliqah Brigade attacked our units 
in Abyan. We, however, exercised self-restraint and did not 
retaliate. The same thing happened again when the 1st Armored 
Division of the Republican Guard attacked the 5th Infantry 
Brigade in Sufyan area in the Sanaa suburbs. That brigade was 
destroyed completely and its soldiers who survived were 
displaced. The final rehearsal was the attack against the 3d 
Armored Brigade in 'Amran on the same day (President) 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih declared war. 
  It thus became apparent to us that the northern president 
wants to exterminate not only his political opponents, but also 
every officer and soldier from the southern governorates. This 
was confirmed practically by the all-out war he launched on the 
various fronts and in which he made the villages, towns, and 
civilian installations a target for barbaric and random 
artillery, rocket, and air attacks. 
  [Shihab] How able are the southern forces to stand fast in 
the face of the northern troops, despite the other side's 
superiority in number and military equipment? 
  [Tahir] It is sufficient to say that (President) 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih and his advisers planned to settle the matter 
within hours, and at maximum in one or two days. This was 
frequently stated either by their president or his advisers, 
such as (Dr.) Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, (Dr.) 'Abd-al-'Aziz 
'Abd-al-Ghani, and (Foreign Minister) Basindwah. This was an 
illusion and a fantasy. The war has entered its second month 
now and our troops are still standing fast against the invading 
and aggressive forces that (President) 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has 
thrown in. He has taken advantage of the numerical superiority, 
not only of his regular troops but also of the thousands of 
citizens from the central areas. He used these citizens for two 
purposes: To serve as human shields in his aggressive war on 
the one hand, and on the other, to get these citizens killed 
and, consequently, to weaken these areas so that they will not 
pose any threat against him in the future. 
  Despite their smaller number, our Armed Forces have managed 
not only to confront and stand fast, but also to deal fatal 
blows to the aggressive troops and force them to retreat in more 
than one battle and on more than one front. This has actually 
happened on the Kharaz front, where three reinforced brigades -- 
the 1st 'Urubah Brigade, the 4th 'Urubah Brigade, and Khalid 
Barracks -- were defeated in a battle against one of our 
brigades. I can confirm that our Armed Forces are capable of 
defense and can stand fast. 
  [Shihab] As a former defense minister in united Yemen, how 
do you view the northern forces' capability of continuing the 
war? 
  [Tahir] I believe that the combat capabilities of the 
regular 
forces, dominated by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's family, have been 
exhausted. Thousands of civilians mobilized by tribal men ran 
away from the battles, were killed, or surrendered after they 
discovered the falseness of the slogans raised by al-Ahmar's 
clan -- slogans claiming that unity and legitimacy are being 
defended and that the south and the central regions are 
secessionists. 
  [Shihab] Battles are now raging in the southern regions, and 
your role is defensive. Will you launch an attack to expel the 
northern forces from your territories? 
  [Tahir] It is quite natural that battles are raging in 
southern regions as you have described them, because 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih's forces have been preparing for this 
comprehensive war against the sons of the southern governorates 
by massing and mobilizing all forces and means, at a time when 
we dealt with the unity in an emotional and innocent manner as 
if it were an irrevocable issue. Therefore, our combat 
operations are defensive. In other words, we are defending the 
sons of the southern and eastern governorates. At the same 
time, our forces dealt crushing blows to the hostile forces, 
inflicted on them huge losses in life and equipment, and forced 
them to retreat and withdraw on several fronts. 
  [Shihab] Do you have any idea of when the battle will be 
decided? 
  [Tahir] Our cause is just because we did not attack anybody. 
We are defending our people, who will support us regardless of 
circumstances or the duration of the war. 
  [Shihab] Aden seems to be besieged on three sides. Are there 
any plans to break the siege and link Aden again with other 
governorates in the near future? 
  [Tahir] Aden, as well as the southern and eastern 
governorates, suffered from the central government in Sanaa, 
which tried to impose the system of the Republic of Yemen. Aden 
also has suffered from the presence of the Sanaa regime's forces 
in Abyan and Lahij in the north and the east since the 
establishment of the unity. 
  State institutions in Aden, along with its honest and 
cooperative citizens, enabled Aden to rise again to carry out 
its duties as a capital of our young republic and even as a 
capital of all Yemen. It is the one that hosted the National 
Political Forces Dialogue and it was a venue for the national 
conference. 
  We are not only defending Aden, but also all the territories 
of the Democratic Republic of Yemen. All the sons of the 
northern governorates are taking part in this effort, especially 
the sons of the central regions who are impatiently waiting for 
the day of salvation from the domination of al-Ahmar's clan. 
  [Shihab] Some circles talk about northern penetrations in 
southern ranks, and some others say that commanders of some 
units were executed in the battlefield. Is this true? 
  [Tahir] It is quite natural that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih will 
find supporters within our units because we believed we had one 
state and one army. But the northern president and his 
supporters behaved in a conspiratorial and opportunist way. I 
can assure you that these elements are very few and do not 
affect at all our forces' defensive position. 
  [Shihab] In your opinion, was this breakthrough the cause 
of the northern Yemeni forces' success in penetrating deep into 
the southern territory? 
  [Tahir] The so-called northern forces' success in 
penetrating 
deep in the southern territory was first caused by the element 
of surprise in war; that is, the method of treachery followed by 
the forces of 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, in addition to the numerical 
superiority and the mobilization of thousands of tribal men. In 
view of all this, our forces had to absorb the surprise attacks, 
deal crushing blows to the attacking forces, and reorganize. 
  [Shihab] It was observed recently that your forces possessed 
new weapons and equipment. Did you obtain new weapons from 
abroad? 
  [Tahir] We have not obtained any weapons or equipment from 
abroad. The most important weapon we have is the well-trained 
Yemeni individual who is aware of the just cause he is adhering 
to; namely, the cause of defending his land and honor. 
  [Shihab] Southern military communiques say that your forces 
fired surface-to-air missiles that intercepted northern missiles 
and destroyed them over Aden. Does this mean that your forces 
possess enough of these missiles to ward off any heavy missile 
attacks on Aden? 
  [Tahir] The firing of surface-to-surface missiles by 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih's forces against homes of innocents citizens is 
a sign of bankruptcy in this losing war. These forces believed 
that they would be able to decide the course of this war within 
one or two days. Indeed, or defense units shot down a number of 
these missiles. 
  [Shihab] You have been quoted as saying that the northern 
forces employed chemical weapons in the Shabwah Governorate. Do 
you intend to retaliate by employing similar weapons? Do you 
have proof of your accusations? 
  [Tahir] What we have said were justifiable suspicions. Those 
who began this destructive war against an entire people and used 
savage shelling by all means of heavy weapons, including 
missiles, will not hesitate to employ whatever they lay their 
hand on. Our suspicions are strengthened by the relationship 
between 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Iraqi President Saddam Husayn, 
who is known for his longstanding hostility to our people. 
Presidential Council Chairman 'Ali Salim al-Bid's description 
of 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih as a "little Saddam" is not without 
significance.

  [Text] The popular resistance in Shu'ayb led by fighters of 
the liberation war with great courage and heroism repulsed 
yesterday the attacks of the gang of the al-Ahmar clan, 
inflicting on the enemy huge human and materiel losses. The 
popular resistance managed to kill a number of enemy officers 
and men of the invading forces. Among those killed was staff 
Colonel Muhammad 'Abdallah Haydar al-Sanhani, a relative of the 
leader of the gang of the al-Ahmar gang, who was [words 
indistinct] al-Hamzah and had been charged with leading the 
attack on Dhamar and the liquidation of al-Dali' and Shu'ayb. 
The popular resistance found in his possession orders from 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih charging him with the destruction of al-Dali' 
and Shu'ayb and killing their inhabitants without mercy, looting 
their possessions, and [word indistinct] their land, all of 
which is indicative of the savagery of the criminal and inhuman 
operations being conducted by the gang of the al-Ahmar clan and 
its (?hungry) retinue.

  [Text] An official source in the Ministry of Electricity 
and Water told the Yemeni news agency, Aden, that in 
continuation of the all-out war launched by the Sanaa military 
rulers against the people of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, 
particularly the brutal shelling of the economic and social 
establishments, the al-Ahmar gang's warplanes last Saturday [4th 
June] shelled the (?Aden- Lahij) water electricity generator and 
stopped pumping of water to the residential quarters in the 
capital, Aden. The Public Corporation for Water was able to 
repair the generator and pump the water. The enemy warplanes 
once again shelled the same generator yesterday by personal 
instructions of the head of the Sanaa ruling regime. The source 
confirmed that the Public Water Corporation is currently 
repairing the generator.

  [Text] Aden, 8 Jun (KUNA) -- Military officials in South 
Yemen announced today that the northern forces have continued 
their bombardment of Aden airport while the main oil refinery in 
Aden is still on fire for the third successive day. 
  These officials told KUNA that a number of 
surface-to-surface 
missiles landed on Aden airport at dawn today. The airport has 
for the last several days been under indiscriminate bombardment 
in a move to prevent military aircraft from flying from it. 
However, they did not report any casualties. 
  The Yemeni news agency in Aden has quoted security sources 
as 
having said that the village of Dar Sa'd, which lies 15 km from 
the capital, was subjected last night to an indiscriminate 
bombardment by the artillery of the northern forces which left 
18 people killed and no less than 23 wounded. The agency said 
the southern forces responded fiercely to silence the source of 
the fire while resisting to check the advance of these forces 
which seek to tighten the noose on the city from different 
directions. 
  On the other hand the capital Aden was still suffering from 
shortages of drinking water and foodstuffs, the prices of which 
have skyrocketed dramatically, according to some Yemenis. Yemeni 
citizens interviewed by KUNA said that the price of a kilogram 
[kg] of potatoes has risen by five times its price before the 
outbreak of fighting between the north and the south, with one 
kg reaching 50 Yemeni riyals in the last two days. (One dollar 
is the equivalent of 12 riyals at the official exchange rate) 
  An official in the government disclosed in Aden that former 
Algerian Foreign Minister Lakhdar Ibrahimi, the envoy of the UN 
secretary general, will meet with 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the 
secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party, tomorrow or the 
day after at the latest in Mukallah. Ibrahimi is due to arrive 
in Sanaa today from Cairo at the start of a new mission to halt 
the fighting which has been going on in Yemen since 4 May. 
Ibrahimi's mission as the UN envoy begins in accordance with 
Security Council Resolution 924, which calls for an immediate 
cease-fire.

  [Text] It seems that the UN Security Council resolution 
calling for an immediate cease-fire in Yemen has signalled, in 
fact and practice, the beginning of a process toward: 
  1. Secession and the return of the situation to what it 
was before April 1990 -- a state in the north with its capital 
Sanaa and a state in the south with its capital Aden. 
  2. Internalization after the failure of the local and 
internal efforts to reconcile the warring factions in Yemen. 
Added to this is the failure of regional and pan-Arab mediation 
efforts by the Arab brothers and neighbors and their Arab 
League. Following this national and pan-Arab failure, there is 
a need for an "international" solution to at least stop the 
bloodbath and end the massacres that the two sides have been 
carrying out with great appetite. 
  3. Intervention after the sides which have an interest 
with this or that side and which have aligned with the south or 
supported the north have contented themselves with closely 
follow-up the situation or secretly helping this or that side 
during the past month of fighting. 
  After this anticipation, caution, claim of neutrality, and 
non-disclosure of true positions and feelings and after the 
Security Council resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire, 
the external parties -- neighbors and non-neighbors -- will find 
enough cover to intervene publicly and to morally and 
financially support the side that they believe will achieve 
their objectives. 
  There is nothing better than an international umbrella which 
states will use as an excuse for their intervention. This is 
particularly so because up to the moment the Security Council 
resolution was issued, the parties to the dispute had embarked 
on a course leading to: 
  1. Secession. 
  2. Internationalization as a cover from beginning to end. 
  3. Active foreign intervention with politics and even 
with arms and forces. 
  The race of the two leaders, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid, ended in a tie. 
  Salih fired three long-range missiles on Aden -- its 
mosques, 
houses, and inhabitants. 
  Al-Bid responded by forming a government in the south under 
Haydar al-'Attas and including as members all those who can 
offer support in the battle for survival and existence. 
Al-Bid's traditional allies, his old rivals in the party and 
power struggle, and 'Ali Salih's foes in the north, such as 
'Abdallah al-Asnaj, are all qualified to join this government. 
  'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, with his missiles and his forces's 
activity around Aden and the roads leading to it, wanted to 
settle the situation militarily and from a strong position 
before accepting the UN Security Council cease-fire resolution. 
'Ali Salim al-Bid wanted to impose a fait accompli. He hoped 
that negotiations on an international or regional solution or 
settlement through mediation efforts and good offices would be 
held on the basis of this fait accompli, which offers two 
separate and disputant states--not two disputant regions within 
one state. 
  Before analyzing the situation and its future possibilities 
in light of the UN resolution, I would like to explain Egypt's 
stance on the crisis. 
  There is a mistaken feeling which has developed innocently 
or 
not-so-innocently in the Egyptian public and the Arab and world 
media that Egypt's stance essentially supports 'Ali Salim al-Bid 
and hence secession. Some consider support for secession an 
unforgivable sin. This mistaken feeling is translated by some 
inside and outside Egypt as reflecting hostility to President 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salim for his stand on the terrorists whom he has 
sheltered and to whom he has opened training centers where they 
plan and concoct plots under complete freedom without any 
restrictions. 
  The truth of the matter is different. Cairo's relations with 
Sanaa -- the Sanaa of unity or the Sanaa of the north -- is very 
good, especially with President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. 
  The reason is that Cairo has accurate data, containing 
numbers and names, on the size of this "presence" of "political 
Islam" groups on the land of Yemen. They include Egyptians, 
Sudanese, Palestinians, Lebanese, Algerians, Afghans, and others. 
  Egypt knows the powers that foster, protect, finance, and 
nurture these activities in and out of Yemen. It knows the 
"influence of the state," as represented by President Salih and 
his men and institutions, and knows the extent and limits of its 
ability to control. It knows about the power of the tribes and 
the leaders of "political Islam," their size, influence, and 
scope of control. 
  In many of its features, dimensions, and characteristics, 
this situation is similar to the relation between the authority 
of Sudanese President Lieutenant General 'Umar al-Bashir and 
that of "Shaykh Hasan," or Dr. Hasan al-Turabi and his [National 
Salvation] front. Despite the ranks shown on their shoulders 
and the military medals decorating their chests, the heads of 
authority in Sanaa and Sudan, Salih and al-Bashir, own but do 
not rule, and neither al-Turabi nor al-Ahmar carry ranks on 
their shoulders or military medals on their chest. 
  Cairo certainly knows what is happening on the Yemeni and 
Sudanese soils; it knows about the existence, the figures, the 
size, and the activity linked to violence and political Islam 
groups. 
  What interests us today is Yemen and the "extremist" and 
hostile presence there. We are interested in Yemen, both its 
northern and southern sectors, particularly during its time of 
unity from May 1990 to May 1994. 
  In the northern governorate of Sa'dah, there is a camp named 
Sinnarah that provides training in urban warfare, blowing up 
roads, and spreading armed anarchy. Among the members of this 
camp, there are Algerians, Tunisians, Sudanese, Libyans, 
Palestinians, and of course Egyptians, specifically 16 Egyptians. 
  There is (al-Raht) camp in the governorate of Lahij in the 
south. It belongs to the al-Jihad Organization and its training 
techniques focus on "sabotage" operations. Weapons, equipment, 
and supplies are sent directly to this camp from the capital of 
the north, or rather the capital of unity, Sanaa, via mountain 
paths across (Tawr al-Bahah). 
  In the governorate of Ta'izz, a major northern city, lies 
Rawnah camp, where a number of Egyptians belonging to the 
al-Jihad Organization and the Vanguards of Conquest receive 
their training. 
  There is also the camp of ('Ataq and Gharran) in the 
governorate of Shabwah, the oil-rich area of the south. 
  In all these camps, as well as in homes and hideouts and in 
the areas protected by northern army brigades like al-'Amaliqah 
Brigade, stationed in the south, there are active Egyptian 
elements. These elements arrive there, receive their training, 
then disperse to carry out the tasks entrusted to them. Cairo 
knows this and knows many other things. 
  It knows that Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar and his half brother 
'Ali Salim are among the major loyalists and active leaders of 
political Islam and its organizations, those of the "Iranian 
school," those led and financed by Usamah Bin-Ladin and his 
disciples, or those of the international organization in which 
Shaykh Hasan al-Turabi plays an important, powerful, and active 
role. 
  A number of integrated, conflicting, and interlinked factors 
are involved in that blend; they move it and guarantee its 
existence. That blend involves the temptation of money, an 
abundance of it. It involves the "suspicious" connection with 
the elements of international collusion that seek to keep the 
area under control by maintaining its backwardness and 
infighting, or by fanning tribal or regional fanaticism or local 
rivalry. It also involves love for adventure and a desire to 
seek a certain role, even through crime and terrorism, and 
finally involves a twisted and erroneous understanding of Islam, 
its message, and essence. 
  Ugly and serious as it might be, one thing is certain -- the 
fact that acting in the name of unity or partition, the central 
government in Sanaa exercises control only on "civilian" areas 
in and around big cities. Control beyond these limits is in the 
hands of tribes and their chieftains, who are backed by the 
groups and the "amirs and shaykhs" of political Islam, who are 
in actual control at present. 
  In this light, Cairo has realized that backing the civilian 
authority -- as represented in the head of state, his 
foundations and institutions and, particularly, his army -- is 
the only way to maintain and safeguard Yemen's march toward 
breaking free from tribalism and imams rule. This is the only 
way to guarantee an end to grudges, rivalry, and infighting just 
to oblige the "chieftain" or the leaders or amirs of 
organizations that pursue violence and terrorism in the name of 
religion. 
  When Cairo declared its stand through President Mubarak 
that unity cannot be imposed by force and maintained by 
bloodshed, it meant to prevent deepening the wound and meant to 
curb the dispute, division, and hatred caused by wars and 
destruction. It sought to preserve Yemen's forces, 
institutions, and lively and enlightened forces both in the 
north and the south. 
  If the experiment of the past four years could not build 
unitary institutions in the army, administration and in people's 
minds, the path is still open and the future is still full of 
hope provided that ties are maintained, partition is not 
consolidated by wasted blood in the north and the south, and 
Yemen's strength and resources are preserved. That is why the 
contacts by the two sides of the crisis Salih and Salim with 
President Mubarak have not ceased. 
  Let us go back to the beginning of the article. What will 
happen after the Security Council resolution to halt the 
fighting which, as we indicated, opened the way to 
internationalization, partition, and intervention? 
  One of the strategic experts concerned with the Yemeni 
crisis 
and its developments presents three possible scenarios after the 
Security Council's cease-fire resolution. 
  First, in his view, the north will declare that it has 
accepted the resolution, which it did. But at the same time it 
continues its action on the ground by striking at cities and 
homes, especially Aden, it completely rejects dialogue with the 
Socialist Party leaders, especially al-Bid and his men, and it 
demands dialogue with other Socialist Party leaders to be 
designated by itself. Through big, tempting promises, the north 
could impose on them its conditions and achieve the formula it 
is seeking which is naturally the continuation of the unity 
under its leadership and control. 
  Such a scenario is not applicable and is far from being a 
solution and settlement. It opens the door to a painful, 
drawn-out war of annihilation between the north and the south 
and also opens the door to a sharp division within the Socialist 
Party ranks and leaders and the southern leaders amid the 
tragedies of war and the effects of bombardment and destruction 
with an apparent superiority of the northern forces. 
  In second scenario, the north will accept the cease-fire 
through negotiations with the south and Socialist Party leaders, 
led by al-Bid. The conditions for this second probability are: 
  -The south and its forces should be able to hold out 
militarily and prevent the northern forces from capturing Aden, 
Hadhramout, and Mukalla through a reasonable and firm military 
position. 
  -This steadfastness by the southerners should be coupled 
with 
and backed by active, effective international pressure and 
sincere goodwill efforts forcing the northerners to initiate a 
dialogue and disengage the forces. This will pave the way for 
talk about unity at present and in the future or about any other 
formula. 
  In the third scenario, the Security Council's resolution 
will 
be practically rejected outright and the fighting and marches on 
cities and important junctions will continue even if the 
cease-fire remained in place while the true situation is the 
opposite. 
  Such a probability, as well as the blood and destruction 
caused by it every day and every moment and the potential 
foreign interventions in favor of this or that party may prompt 
the international community and the international organization 
to escalate its resolutions from a kind request for a cease-fire 
to punishing the violators of the cease-fire through the 
imposition of a blockade and economic and military sanctions and 
the like. 
  Such a worsening and crumbling situation will not be 
accompanied by only foreign and regional interventions from the 
neighbors but may also prompt many countries to promote the 
recognition and perpetuation of a complete separation between 
the north and the south and may subject the two sides of the 
crisis to the will of the parties that provide each side with 
money, arms, food supplies, and political support. 
  This picture in general reflects the situation in Yemen as 
it 
would be after the war continued and acts of destruction and 
shelling continued and went beyond all limits of what is 
prohibited, thus violating all laws. 
  Perhaps the voice of wisdom and reason and the call of 
patriotic conscience may preserve the Yemeni homeland or what 
remains of its elements of strength and life and what remains of 
the dreams and hopes of unity and merger.
