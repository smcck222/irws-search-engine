  [Text] Russia today expressed the hope that the forthcoming 
visit of the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, to Moscow will 
give a boost to economic and political relations between the two 
countries. 
  Addressing a press conference in New Delhi today, the deputy 
prime minister of Russia, Mr. Yuriy Yarov, said several 
agreements -- including investment guarantee pact and 
cooperation in science and technology -- will be signed during 
the visit. Responding to questions, he said Moscow gives 
priority to ensure uninterrupted supply of defense spares. On 
cryogenic engine technology, the Russian leader said experts 
from both the countries have reached an understanding for the 
supply of engines.

  [Text] New Delhi -- Union Minister for External Affairs 
Dinesh Singh will be out of action for the month as he is 
leaving or Monday for treatment in London. 
  Singh, who took over as External Affairs Minister a 
year-and-a-half ago, has kept indifferent health almost 
throughout the period. 
  Though Singh could not be contacted, his colleagues told 
INDIAN EXPRESS that the minister was leaving for London on 
Monday morning. He was likely to be away for a month, they said. 
  Through sheer coincidence, the top bureaucrat in the 
ministry 
is also not expected to be in Delhi for some days. Foreign 
Secretary K Srinivasan is also in a London Hospital; he flew 
there after catching malaria during his Bulgaria trip with 
President Shankar Dayal Sharma. 
  With an ailing cabinet minister at the top, much of the work 
is split among his two deputies, Ministers of State R L Bhatia 
and Salman Khurshid. 
  Bhatia has just returned from the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) 
Foreign Minister's Conference at Cairo, and Khurshid left on 
Sunday for a week-long trip to Kazakhstan, Kyrghizistan and 
Tajikstan. 
  With illness taking him to London, Dinesh Singh will be 
missing from the scene just when he might be needed at home. 
The Foreign Office should now be working at consolidating the 
gains of Rao's US visit, and another important summit is 
scheduled later this month when Rao flies to Moscow to meet 
President Boris Yeltsin. 
  Like always, Dinesh Singh's illness triggers off bouts of 
speculation about replacing him with a fitter man. The rumour 
mill has begun churning again; and Human Resource Development 
Minister Arjun Singh is now being mentioned as the man who might 
take over the ministry.

  [Text] New Delhi, June 7 (AFP) -- Suspected Muslim rebels 
kidnapped two British hikers in the northern state of Kashmir 
Tuesday as the Army patrolled a southern town after the murder 
of a Hindu leader, the PRESS TRUST OF INDIA said. 
Pushtu-language speaking rebels abducted 16-year-old Kim 
Housego and David Mackie, 36, at Aroo near the resort town of 
Pahalgam, the news agency quoted officials as saying in the 
Kashmir summer capital Srinagar. 
  No group has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping, the 
first of British nationals in Kashmir since 1989, when the 
Muslim separatist drive became violent. 
  A Foreign Office report from London said Housego's parents 
were also kidnapped but released later to transmit the demand of 
the rebels seeking the release of three comrades being held by 
Indian authorities. Housego's father David, formerly a New 
Delhi-based correspondent of the FINANCIAL TIMES, reported the 
abduction to police, officials said. 
  Meanwhile, Army soldiers patrolled the curfew-bound town of 
Bhaderwah in the southern district of Doda to prevent violence 
following the gunning down of Hindu leader Rocher Kumar of the 
Bharatiya Janata Party (Indian People's Party, BJP). Kumar was 
shot dead by unidentified militants in his house early Tuesday. 
His killers fled but the murder sparked clashes and arson 
attacks in which at least 10 houses were torched, officials said. 
  A curfew was clamped in Bhaderwah and the nearby town of 
Kishtwar, both of which are described as "communally sensitive." 
  Officials said 11 more people died overnight Monday in 
gunbattles linked to the Muslim rebel campaign for secession 
from India. India and neighbouring Pakistan have fought two of 
their three wars over the disputed state.

  [Text] In Jammu Kashmir, militants kidnapped two British 
tourists, demanding the release of three foreign mercenaries 
belonging to the Harkatul Ansar outfit. The incident took place 
near Pahalgam yesterday. One of the kidnapped is the son of a 
journalist formerly based in Delhi. The security forces have 
launched a manhunt to secure their release. Militants also 
looted two foreigners of their belongings and cash at gunpoint 
at Aroo near Pahalgam. 
  In another incident, four persons, including two militants 
have been killed in the valley. The security forces nabbed 
eight militants and recovered a large quantity of arms and 
ammunition during search operations. Meanwhile, the indefinite 
curfew imposed in Bhaderwah and Kishtwar towns of Doda District 
is continuing. The curfew was imposed in Bhaderwah town 
yesterday morning following the killing of a BJP [Bharatiya 
Janata Party] leader by militants and the death of another 
person in violent incidents. In Kishtwar, the curfew was 
clamped as a precautionary measure. Security forces are 
patrolling vulnerable areas of both the towns.

<F P=106> [Article by Abu-Sarhan: "The Cabinet Reshuffle"] </F>
  [Text] Market observers noticed on Monday [30 May], that 
the price of the dollar has dropped to 350 dinars. Some people 
said it was offered for 320 dinars but nobody bought it. In 
addition, there has been a visible drop in the prices of all 
supplies. This clearly indicates that there is no scarcity of 
items, which would force prices up due to increasing demand. 
This means these supplies have not been affected by supply and 
demand. Otherwise, the prices would have remained stable in 
spite of the cabinet reshuffle. At any rate, even if some 
changes do occur, they would be slight and not sudden. This 
confirms our past arguments that the increase in the price of 
the dollar is not the outcome of the blockade or the supplies 
that enter the country and the human consumption of these 
supplies. Rather, it is our firm conviction that there is an 
integral system made up of a group of people who have sold out 
to the foreigner. This group represents around 20-30 percent; 
70 percent of this misled group has been blinded by greed and a 
desire to amass money. The group that makes up the 20-30 
percent has foreign links, specifically with Saudi Arabia. This 
group manipulates the price of the dollar to bring about such an 
increase on the black market. 
  Therefore, and as a result of observing the financial market 
in al-Shurjah, we noticed yesterday, Tuesday [31 May], that a 
group of Kurdish traders, who are not well known, started to buy 
dollars at any price, paying 420 or 450 dinars, in an open 
attempt to raise the price of the dollar. 
  Here, we hope the security agencies and the Interior 
Ministry 
will work seriously and closely watch these developments. Had 
it not been for God's care for Iraq and its leader, many 
unexpected developments would have taken place. 
  The most important thing about the cabinet reshuffle, apart 
from the people's joy and the drop in prices, is that this 
reshuffle will make the source of decisions close to the 
executive tools, that is, close to the ministries and their 
leading personalities. 
  Another important point is that we should not judge the work 
of ministries until at least three months have elapsed, because 
the Iraqis are known for their initial rush, which soon 
subsides. These three months represent an observation stage to 
be followed by a scrutiny stage, which will reveal whether a 
certain ministry is really doing its job or is just posing for 
television.

  [Text] Baghdad, June 5, INA -- Prices of commodities 
particularly foodstuffs and vegetables have went down over the 
last few days since President Saddam Husayn has assumed 
premiership in addition to presidency. 
  Markets of vegetables and foodstuffs have seen a steady 
decrease in prices following the assumption of premiership by 
President Saddam Husayn. 
  Prices of vegetables have registered clear decrease, a kilo 
of tomatoes has decreased from 25 dinar to 12 ID [Iraqi dinar], 
while a kilo of potatoes went down to 30 ID while it was 50 ID, 
water melon price decreased from 80 to 30 ID per kilo. Also 
prices of foodstufffs such as cooking oil, sugar, flour and rice 
have gone down. 
  The increase in prices of commodities is attributed to the 
continuation of the sanctions which prevent Iraq from exporting 
its oil and eventually preventing it from importing even the 
foodstuffs. 
  The assumption of President Saddam Husayn to the premiership 
has led to this decrease in price of commodities. 
  Since his assumption of premiership, a few days ago the 
president has taken many steps to bring down prices. 
  The president has ordered to increase quotas of certain 
foodstuffs which are distributed by the government to every 
Iraqi within the ration system. 
  The amount of cooking oil increase of from 625 grams per 
capita per month to 750 grams. The president has also ordered 
the increase of the additional quota of cooking oil granted by 
government to civil servants from 1.5 kilo to 2 kilos.

<F P=106> [By Nabil al-Wadi and Latif al-Tayyib] </F>
  [Text] Interior Ministry inspectors have embarked on an 
intensive campaign covering major marketplaces in Baghdad's new 
areas: al-Hurriyah, al-Sadriyah, and the Malhani marketplace, as 
well as the vegetable marketplaces in al-Hillah, eastern 
al-Karradah, al-A'zamiyah, and al-Dawrah. On 28 and 29 May, 
AL-JUMHURIYAH noticed relative stability in prices and a rush by 
citizens to buy vegetables and fruit, which had seen prices 
skyrocket during the blessed 'Id al-Adha holidays. The price 
hikes were caused by the greed of shopkeepers and grocers who 
insist on maintaining this situation in the market, disregarding 
the suffering of citizens, especially low-income citizens. 
  At the beginning of their campaign, the men of the Economic 
Crime Combat Department made sure materials sold at the prices 
set by the state's agencies. In some cases, they took charge of 
direct selling to the public. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH toured the main fruit and vegetable 
marketplaces. It noticed a drop in prices in comparison with the 
'Id al-Adha prices. In interviews with AL-JUMHURIYAH, citizens 
expressed appreciation for this experience, hoping that prices 
will continue to drop or at least remain stable. Colonel Diya' 
Qaddah 'Abd-al-Ghaffar, chief of the Economic Crime Combat 
Department, spoke about the dimensions of the new campaign and 
its effective results to stabilize prices. He noted citizens' 
satisfaction with this campaign. He said that during the past 
two days, inspectors have reported many price violations, 
especially of vegetable and fruit prices. He said the fine for 
the first price violation has been set at 10,000 dinars. If the 
violation is repeated, the fine will be doubled. This is 
especially necessary because it has been noted that some vendors 
raise prices beyond normal ranges, overburdening low-income 
citizens. He told AL-JUMHURIYAH that the department has 
controlled the process of selling agricultural crops, obligating 
farmers to sell their crops at the marketing offices in 
accordance with official prices and under the supervision of 
economic crime combat men. He said this move has been effective 
in making available plenty of crops and commodities. He said 
this has resulted in increasing supply and reducing prices. 
  He said that this comprehensive campaign at marketplaces 
started after many citizens complained about conditions in the 
marketplaces and unjustifiable price increases. He said this 
campaign will continue "nonstop", to put an end to whoever is 
deluded into tampering with the people's subsistence. He said 
that during the past two days, inspectors closed 58 vegetable 
shops and confiscated their contents. They also seized large 
quantities of banned materials, such as imported cigarettes. 
Soft drinks factories, he noted, have been uncovered in many 
areas of Baghdad, especially in the al-Dawrah area. Samples of 
their products have been sent to laboratories to ensure their 
fitness for human consumption. 
  The colonel stressed that the objective of this campaign is 
to serve citizens and to end price violations and fraud in the 
marketplaces. He said the economic crime combat men have 
apprehended a large number of people who had impersonated 
economic security men, prompted by their greed to tamper with 
citizens' money and property. He said they had been wearing 
military uniform with guns on their waists, using vehicles 
similar to those used by the economic crime combat men, and 
carrying false identification. 
  The director of the Economic Crime Combat Department 
stressed 
to AL-JUMHURIYAH that all divisions of the department have been 
mobilized to implement the "new plan." The objective of this 
plan is to ease citizens' burdens, he noted. He said the coming 
days will witness true improvement in the situation, in terms of 
commodities availability, prices, and stability. He urged 
citizens to cooperate with inspectors by reporting violations 
and contacting the complaints section on 8878319 so immediate 
deterrent measures can be taken against violators.

  [Text] The Revolution Command Council [RCC] has issued a

competent agencies. 
  The following is the text of the decree: 
  In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate 
  The Republic of Iraq 
  The RCC 
  Decree No. 56 
  Dated 22 Dhu al-Hijjah, 1414 Hegira, corresponding to 2 June 
1994 
<H8>  Decree </H8>
  Based on the provisions of Paragraph A, Article 42 of the

  1. The party section command of the Arab Socialist Ba'th 
Party and the people's council in the region shall, separately, 
be given the following powers: 
  A. Closing wholesale and retail shops for six months if the 
owner of the shop -- or anyone who is doing the selling on his 
behalf -- violates the prices announced by the state's competent 
agencies. The party section command and the people's council may 
decide to detain the owner at the police center in the region 
for no more than six months. The decisions stipulated in this 
paragraph shall be made by majority. 
  B. If the shopkeeper repeated the violation stipulated in A, 
the party's section command or the people's council in the 
region may decide, by majority, to close the shop and cancel the 
license given to him or any other license under which the 
shopkeeper is given permission to sell or buy, and detain him 
for 1 year. 
  2. The shopkeeper against whom a closure, cancellation of 
license, or detention decision is issued for any of the two 
violations stipulated in Paragraph A of this decree shall have 
the right to appeal the decision issued against him at the 
branch command regarding the decisions issued by the section 
command and at the higher command commission regarding the 
decisions issued by the people's councils. This is done by a 
written request made by the shopkeeper or his agent within a 
week of the issuance of the decision. The party to which an 
appeal is filed should review the contestation within one week 
of its filing. It has the right to cancel, amend, or endorse, 
by majority, the decision that was contested. Its decision 
shall then be final. 
  3. The section command or the people's council in the region

<F P=106> [Special report: "Request for Mediation"] </F>
  [Text] Following the bloody clashes among the Iraqi Kurds, 
which started a month ago in northern Iraq and which has led to 
hundreds of deaths and wounded, recently Mas'ud Barzani, leader 
of the Kurdish Democratic Party; Jalal Talabani, leader of the 
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan; and Shaykh 'Uthman 'Abd-al-'Aziz, 
leader of the Islamic Movement of Iraqi Kurdistan--the heads of 
the conflicting groups in northern Iraq--have requested 
officials of the Islamic Republic of Iran to mediate in ending 
the bloodshed among them. This comes at a time when the Western 
forces deployed in northern Iraq are pretending that they have 
exerted great efforts to end the bloodshed! However, the Iraqi 
Kurds have documented proof in hand that shows that not only 
have the Western forces not taken any effective steps to this 
end, but they have been the major fomenter of these conflicts, 
hence their call for their leaders to ask the officials of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran to mediate in ending the bloodshed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Kurdistan Democratic Party Leader Mas'ud </F>
Barzani by Zuhayr Qusaybati; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Qusaybati] What is the latest on the security 
situation? Have the clashes and skirmishes stopped? 
  [Barzani] The security situation is moving toward 
relaxation. Efforts to disengage the forces are continuing in 
all areas. Everyone, with the participation of the Iraqi 
National Congress [INC] and the Kurdistan Front, is making 
commendable efforts to consolidate the cease-fire and separate 
the forces. These efforts have, to a large extent, been 
reflected on the ground. 
  [Qusaybati] What, in your view, is the way or the solution 
that would consolidate security? 
  [Barzani] I believe the solution that would consolidate 
security lies in faith in pluralism, democratic methods, and 
recourse to the people and to political dialogue to contain 
problems. I do not see any other solution. That is how it is 
with all democratic systems. The solution also lies in 
adherence to the decisions of the operations room and serious 
and responsible implementation of these decisions. 
  [Qusaybati] Do you really believe that a dispute over land 
is 
a good enough reason for an outbreak of fighting that is harmful 
to the region? 
  [Barzani] No, it is not a question of a piece of land. It 
has to do with ways of tackling problems and resolving a 
political matter, and it also has to do with the mobilization 
and education of cadres, and with the question of hegemony. At 
the beginning of the crisis I sent a cable to the [Patriotic] 
Union [of Kurdistan, PUK] and [Kurdistan] Democratic Party [KDP] 
officials in the Raniyah area, urging them both to act in unison 
to contain the problem in Qal'at Dizah, and I held them 
responsible for that. Contrary to my expectations, the PUK 
official in Raniyah dispatched a military force to Qal'at Dizah. 
And when a government delegation from both sides was in 
Raniyah, our forces' positions there were the target of 
occupation and looting. 
  Within three days, the fighting covered the areas of 
al-Sulaymaniyah and Karkuk. The PUK then moved its forces 
directly to Irbil. We can conclude from that that there was a 
premeditated plan. We have some evidence, which we do not wish 
to reveal now, supporting the theory of a military coup by the 
PUK. Despite the harm done to our forces, a meeting was held on 
4 May and leadership committees were formed to normalize the 
situation in all areas, but these committees made no progress. 
After 4 May, we had to resort to positive defense to stop the 
excesses of the PUK forces. 
  [Qusaybati] Jalal Talabani has told AL-HAYAH that Iranian 
Revolutionary Guard elements supported the KDP fighters and 
"Revolutionary Hizballah" with artillery shelling. What is your 
reaction to that? 
  [Barzani] We have been hearing that a lot and we have also 
heard that some Iranian Revolutionary Guard members were taken 
prisoner. We called on the PUK at the time to show these 
captives on the television screen so that the Kurdish people 
would know. We have also read statements claiming that the PUK 
was the target of a comprehensive plot with the participation of 
Iran, Turkey, our party, and the Islamic Movement in Iraq. Then 
we read that Jalal Talabani had asked Iran to invite the PUK, 
our party, and the Islamic Movement to Tehran, and to mediate. 
And there were other statements. At any rate, I do not know of 
and have not seen any Iranian participation in this dispute. 
  [Qusaybati] Talabani's statements and confirmations by 
Iraqi opposition sources seem to indicate that he feared an 
attack on his motorcade on his return to Kurdistan (from 
Damascus), and this delayed his return. Do you believe these 
fears are serious? 
  [Barzani] We have been awaiting Talabani's return for three 
weeks and I see no justification for the delay. His presence 
would certainly facilitate the cease-fire and solve many 
problems. Many attempts were made to secure Talabani's return, 
and Dr. Ahmad al-Jalabi (chairman of the INC Executive Council) 
and I sent a written message on 14 May assuring him that all 
precautions would be taken to ensure his safe return across the 
Syrian-Iraqi border. 
  Talabani wanted me to go to Zakhu to receive him. I have no 
objection to doing that, but I cannot leave my headquarters 
because of the situation and the efforts to consolidate the 
cease-fire. I told him that I would send a high-level 
delegation from the political bureaus of our party and the PUK 
to receive him. Fear of an attack on his motorcade in the area 
of Dahuk is unfounded. Treachery is not one of our 
characteristics. 
  [Qusaybati] The PUK has been critical of the 50/50 principle 
with your party (in jobs) and sees that as one of the factors 
contributing to the tension. 
  [Barzani] The 50/50 principle in the administration has 
caused major problems and has been one of the causes of tension. 
We believe that principle should be abolished in a democratic 
way, by going back to the people. We suggested that idea months 
ago and we promised to respect the result whatever it may be. 
The suggestions we made at our joint meetings calling for new 
elections were met with an extensive media campaign and other 
measures and manifestations reaching the point of direct 
aggression. Despite all that had happened, I did not expect 
matters to reach this dangerous level and did not expect a 
recourse to force to overturn the balances of power. 
  [Qusaybati] Turkey has announced that it is preparing for a 
meeting between you and Talabani. Do you see a need for such 
mediation? 
  [Barzani] Several friendly quarters have offered mediation. 
We viewed the Turkish initiative positively and a meeting was 
held between two delegations from the leaderships of our party 
and the PUK in Silobi. The meeting was positive. We are 
interested in all initiatives aimed at containing the crisis.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Adnan Husayn: "Barzani and Talabani Agree To </F>
Halt Armed Conflict"] 
  [Excerpts] London -- The Iraqi Kurdish leaders Mas'ud 
Barzani and Jalal Talabani have agreed to end the fighting that 
continued between their militias during the past month and to 
eliminate the effects of the most extensive armed clashes Iraqi 
Kurdish areas have witnessed since they were placed under UN 
protection in the spring of 1991. 
  Barzani and Talabani held a meeting the day before yesterday 
in Irbil, capital of the Kurdish region. It is the first 
meeting since the armed confrontations broke out early in May. 
[passage omitted] The two Kurdish leaders' agreement includes 
three clauses: 
  -- A total cease-fire in all areas, including the areas 
adjacent to the border with Iran in al-Sulaymaniyah Governorate 
(where Patriotic Union of Kurdistan militias clashed with groups 
of Kurdish Islamists) 
  -- To form an operations room for the border areas, to 
consolidate the cease-fire there. This room should include 
representatives from Barzani's party, Talabani's party, the 
Unified Iraqi National Congress, the Kurdistan Front, and the 
Islamic Movement of Kurdistan. 
  -- To hold similar meetings later to solve outstanding 
problems, fully normalize conditions, and eliminate the effects 
of last month's events in various spheres. 
  Independent Kurdish sources believe that Barzani's and 
Talabani's meeting "was necessary to halt the Kurdish fighting." 
However, they warned of the eruption of "further clashes" in the 
future "if the two parties do not backtrack on their 
monopolization of power" in Iraqi Kurdistan "and reorganize 
conditions to form a (local) parliament and a government in 
which all parties are represented."

  [Text] In an interview with KURDISTAN NWAY, which will be 
published tomorrow, Wednesday, brother Jalal Talabani, secretary 
general of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK], said 
disarmament is essential. He added: We hope that Kurdistan 
will become a region where only the regular forces carry arms in 
defense of our borders. 
  Asked to comment on Kurdistan Democratic Party leader Mas'ud 
Barzani's proposal for the disarmament of Iraq's Kurdistan and 
its protection by the international community, brother Talabani 
said the PUK is ready to take the necessary steps to implement 
this sacred objective. He added: It is essential that we 
ourselves take this step under the supervision of the Kurdistan 
region government. We could form a committee made up of the 
interior minister, minister of the peshmerga affairs, and the 
director of the police corps to achieve this objective, he added. 
  Brother Talabani pointed out that expediting the 
normalization of the situation and ensuring the return of 
security and order to the sons of our people in Kurdistan would 
contribute to creating the atmosphere and necessary grounds for 
establishing the rule of law, democracy, and human rights.

<F P=106> [Report by Zuhayr Qusaybati: "Talabani Meets With Barzani To </F>
Confirm Reconciliation and the Islamists Accuse Him of 
Negotiating With Baghdad"] 
  [Excerpts] London -- The Islamic Movement has renewed its 
campaign against the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK] led by 
Jalal Talabani, and it has accused the latter of sending a 
delegation to Baghdad to resume negotiations with the Iraqi 
Government. Talabani was due to meet yesterday with Kurdistan 
Democratic Party [KDP] Leader Mas'ud Barzani, his partner in the 
Kurdistan Front [KF] leadership, at the Shirin Palace Hotel in 
Shaqlawah for the first time since the fighting broke out 
between their two parties about a month ago. The fighting is 
believed to have left hundreds of casualties in northern Iraq. 
The purpose of the meeting is to confirm the reconciliation 
between the two parties. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, PUK sources have denied that Talabani sent an 
envoy to Baghdad to negotiate with the Iraqi Government. The 
Islamic Movement in Kurdistan had claimed that the Kurdish 
leader had sent Shaykh 'Abd-al-Latif al-Barzanji to Baghdad on 
22 May and that the efforts of the latter, which coincided with 
the Kurdish infighting, made no progress. 
  The sources said "al-Barzanji is an Irbil merchant who has 
no links with the PUK." [passage omitted]

  [Text] The fighting between the Democratic Party of 
Kurdistan [DPK] and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK] in 
northern Iraq has not ended, regardless of the many cease-fire 
agreements the two sides have reached until now. Although the 
sides have claimed that they are heeding the latest cease-fire 
agreement, an official of the National Congress of Iraq, which 
is made up of several groups that are opposed to Saddam Husayn, 
has said that uninterrupted clashes are continuing in Halabjah. 
The official, who prefers to remain anonymous, has said that at 
least 600 persons have been killed in the clashes thus far, the 
great majority of whom supported the PUK. 
  Meanwhile, it has been reported that DPK Leader Mas'ud 
Barzani and PUK leader Jalal Talabani have been unable to draw 
up an agreement to end the fighting. 
  The Western countries headed by the United States 
established 
an autonomous region in northern Iraq when Saddam Husayn moved 
against the Kurds after the Gulf War ended. The DPK and PUK 
took part in the parliament of the Kurdish administration with 
equal strength after the elections in 1992. The dispute between 
the two sides broke out on 1 May. An international effort has 
been made to establish a basis for peace between the two sides. 
Turkey has contributed toward that effort. However, the 
initiatives that have been made have failed to yield results 
thus far.

  [Text] Sanandaj (Kurdistan Prov.), June 7, IRNA -- The 
north eastern Iraqi cities of Banjwin and Qal'at Dizah have been 
taken over by forces loyal to Iraq's Kurdistan Democratic Party 
(KDP) and the Islamic Movement Party (IMP) on Tuesday [7 June]. 
  According to an IMP spokesman scores of forces of Iraq's 
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) were killed or injured in the 
clashes with the joint forces. 
  Latest dispatches from the area indicate that leaders of the 
warring groups are to start first round of their official talks 
in erbil on wednesday under supervision of the so-called iraqi 
national congress -- a loose grouping of various factions 
opposed to the regime in Baghdad -- to end the ongoing power 
struggle in Iraqi Kurdistan. 
  Irbil, the second major Kurdish city after Karkuk, has been 
declared capital of Iraqi Kurdistan by the self-proclaimed 
government of Kurds. The city is 15 kms away from the buffer 
zone which separates Kurdish controlled areas from the Iraqi 
forces.

friendship and cooperation. President al-Asad also expressed 
similar feelings and desire. 
  Concluding his statement, Tian Zengpei expressed thanks for 
the warm reception accorded to him, and wished Syria, under the 
leadership of President Hafiz al-Asad, more achievements, 
progress, and prosperity.

joint committee for economic, trade, scientific, and technical 
cooperation were signed at the State Planning Commission today. 
The minutes were signed for Syria by Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahim 
al-Subay'i, minister of state for planning affairs, and for 
India by Kamaluddin Ahmed, India's minister of state for trade. 
  The cooperation covers trade exchange through all possible 
means, including equitable deals, as well as economic 
cooperation in the fields of agriculture, industry, electricity, 
transportation, technological cooperation, training of technical 
cadres in the fields of electric energy, railways, education, 
health, in addition to cooperation between scientific research 
centers in both countries. 
  The Indian minister of state for trade and his delegation 
left Damascus this evening following a six-day visit to the

describing it as positive and useful. He also commended the 
growing relations of friendship and cooperation between the two 
countries in various fields, asserting the need to deepen and 
enhance them. 
  He further stressed India's positions that support Arab 
causes, pointing to Syria's efforts to achieve a just and 
comprehensive peace. He asserted that peace cannot be achieved 
in the region except by Israel's withdrawal from the occupied 
Arab territories, in line with the principles and resolutions of 
international legitimacy and the land-for-peace principle. 
  The Indian minister concluded by thanking the Syrian people 
and government for the warm reception and hospitality he and his 
delegation have been accorded. He also noted his admiration of 
the comprehensive progress made by Syria under the leadership of

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] In its meeting today, the 
Council of Ministers reviewed a number of agenda issues. Our 
correspondent for political affairs met with Information 
Minister Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, who spoke about the council 
decisions. 
  [Begin recording] [Al-'Anani] The first issue discussed was 
preparations for the expected visit to Jordan by Syrian Prime 
Minister Mahmud al-Zu'bi, who will head a delegation on a visit 
to Amman early next week to attend the meetings of the Joint 
Jordanian-Syrian Higher Committee. The Council of Ministers 
also discussed preparations for this expected visit since His 
Majesty King Husayn and His Excellency President Hafiz al-Asad 
asked the two governments to enhance bilateral relations to be 
in line with the agreement between the leaders of both 
countries. The Council of Ministers made preparations for 
political, economic, and financial files in order to develop 
relations with the brothers in Syria. 
  The second subject discussed by the Council of Ministers was 
a reconsideration of the local government and administration in 
Jordan. As a first step within the framework of a comprehensive 
reorganization system, it was agreed to promote four districts 
into governorates. These are 'Ajlun, Jarash, Ma'daba, and 
al-'Aqabah. This decision will be followed by other future 
decisions in order to complete this system. 
  [Correspondent Salim 'Ali Dhiyab] What are your views on 
[Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on] Peres' statements on the 
fixed borders in the Dead Sea area, and the meetings of the 
tripartite committee in Washington? 
  [Al-'Anani] Actually, the Israeli foreign minister's 
statement deals with the instability of the surface of the Dead 
Sea, which makes it difficult, in his view, to define or 
demarcate borders in that area. On the one hand, his statement 
may contain a positive sign that he accepts the concept or 
principle of demarcation of borders, and this is something we 
understand positively. As for placing technical obstacles for 
border demarcation, we believe this is something that should be 
left for technicians to assess. I think that there are 
technicians in Jordan who are fully aware of these issues, and 
know the reason for low and changing water levels in the Dead 
Sea, which is the Israeli excessive pumping from the sources of 
the River Jordan. 
  [Dhiyab] But why this statement at this very time, the 
beginning of the committee meetings? 
  [Al-'Anani] I don't know the exact reasons that he has said 
this, but we can now decide our position on his statement. We 
do not accept such statements as a reason for delaying the issue 
or for not adhering to the Jordanian rights to specify our clear 
share in the Dead Sea. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "News at Ten" program] </F>
  [Text] Jordan said current talks in Washington would place 
adequate emphasis on regaining its rightful share of water and 
securing recognized borders with Israel. 
  Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs and Information 
Minister Jawad al-'Anani said Jordan's water rights were 
embedded in international and regional agreements, and that it 
insisted on enforcing such agreements. He also blamed Israel 
for excessive water siphoning from the River Jordan and its 
tributaries. 
  Speaking to "News at Ten" reporter Maha al-Sha'ir, Dr. 
al-'Anani said it was important to settle the issue of how to 
divide water among the region's riparian states. The minister 
also stressed the need for reaching agreement on recognized and 
secure borders, and that technical problems should not stand in 
the way of the demarcation process. He said the current 
cease-fire line with Israel is not a good recipe for peace. 
  [Begin recording] [Al-'Anani] What is more important is that 
each country should live within recognized and secure 
boundaries. The current cease-fire lines do not constitute a 
recipe for permanent peace. Therefore, our insistence on 
demarcation boundaries is because we want to create also the 
atmosphere which would be conducive for permanent peace in the 
area. 
  [Al-Sha'ir] You referred to reports from Israelis that it is 
very difficult to put lines or border demarcations for that area 
of the Dead Sea for instance. 
  [Al-'Anani] Well, I think the foreign minister of Israel was 
specifically referring to the technical problems which might be 
encountered in trying to delineate boundaries in the Dead Sea 
itself. He might be referring, either to certain geological 
factors in that area or he was specifically referring to the 
fact that the surface of the Dead Sea was continuously shifting 
and moving because of over water siphoning that is taking place 
in the area, and we think that Israel is very much to blame for 
overdrawing from the River Jordan and its tributaries, which 
eventually thrown to the Dead Sea. And, therefore, while we 
acknowledge that there might be difficulty, but this does not 
construe any clear reason for not engaging in the demarcation 
process itself. [end recording]

    [Editorial report] Amman Jordan Television Network in 
Arabic at 1840 GMT on 6 June carried the 60-minute weekly 
program "Topical Issues" moderated by Jarir Maraqah. The 
program, which this week deals with the Middle East peace 
process and Jordan's stand vis-a-vis this process, hosts 
Jordanian Information Minister Dr. Jawad al-'Anani and 
journalist Salamah Ni'mat. 
  The program moderator begins by reviewing the peace process 
in light of the statements made by King Husayn after chairing 
the cabinet session on 4 June. Analyzing the new developments 
in the peace process, al-'Anani reviews the peace talks on the 
Arab-Israeli tracks saying that the peace process is continuous 
and changeable. He then says: "The Jordanian position basically 
derives its strength from a united Arab position on the external 
level and from its domestic impregnability on the internal 
front. We have our own circumstances, our own geography, and 
our own demography which are known by all. Therefore, those who 
fabricate rumors against Jordan or those who attempt to shake 
the Jordanian negotiating stand are in fact encroaching on 
Jordan's dignity in terms of demography and geography." He adds 
that Jordan intervened in light of the developments in the peace 
process "to guarantee Jordan's borders and geography." He says: 
"Therefore, border demarcation has become, for Jordan, a 
process that would avert the basic threat coming from Israel or 
from its attempts to tamper with this matter. Also, we should 
safeguard the demographic structure in Jordan. His majesty the 
king has always stressed that we are one people who have equal 
rights and duties." 
  Journalist Salamah Ni'mat speaks about weak Arab 
coordination 
and deviation of the peace process from the Madrid framework, 
saying that the PLO is interested in reaching an agreement that 
serves its strategic interests which might be different from 
Jordan's. He says that Jordan cannot wait until settlements are 
reached between Israel and the other Arab sides. 
  Turning to the agenda signed by Jordan and Israel, al-'Anani 
reviews the formation of the tripartite economic committee which 
will meet in Washington on 6 June, adding that "unofficial 
talks" will cover the issues of water and borders. He adds that 
Israel claimed that the Jordanian side delayed the talks because 
it insisted on not discussing the other issues, such as economic 
issues, before settling the issues of border and water, saying 
that these are basic Jordanian rights that must be addressed. 
He says that Jordan has always tried to convince the United 
States that Jordan does not want to obstruct the peace process, 
but wants to achieve specific things. He says: "If the Israeli 
side shows enough flexibility in Washington -- something which 
we will know soon -- and there is a need to form committees to 
discuss the border and water issues on the ground it will be 
useless to waste the opportunity by not forming technical 
committees here on the ground -- that is, in the region." 
  Asked if Jordan will resume talks on the Jordanian-Israeli 
track in Washington within the resumption of all talks or will 
agree on a new mechanism for implementation, al-'Anani says: 
"It is unfair to address this question to Jordan alone. The 
Madrid equation does not concern Jordan alone; it concerns all 
Arab tracks. If the Arab countries continue with the current 
method of negotiations, would Jordan return to Washington alone?" 
  Asked if Jordan is ready to host the meetings of 
Jordanian-Israeli committees, al-'Anani says: "If this comes 
within the framework of returning Jordanian territory and water, 
the answer is yes. A team should be present on this side and 
the other side. They should meet at the geographical site which 
should be defined, not in any other place." 
  Journalist Ni'mat then speaks about the Arab-Israeli 
normalization process and requirements of the peace process. He 
says that the majority of people does not attach great 
importance if talks with the Israelis are moved to Jordan. The 
information minister says that Jordan is prepared technically to 
hold direct talks on the issue of borders here on the ground. 
  The information minister then touches on future 
Jordanian-Palestinian relations and the importance of 
concentrating on priorities. He says that Jordan seeks to 
establish relations based on common interests. Ni'mat then 
reviews Palestinian-Israeli agreements and their impact on 
Jordanian-Palestinian relations. 
  Al-'Anani then speaks about the importance of stability and 
security to achieve and maintain peace.

<F P=106> [Interview with Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani by </F>
Ashraf Khalil in Amman; date not given] 
  [Text] [Khalil] I sense from your words that the Jordanian 
media have meager resources and that they fail to interpret 
reality. What are the problems? 
  [Al-'Anani] I believe that what is happening in the 
Jordanian media--particularly television--is a reflection of 
what happened to the economy in the wake of the Gulf crisis; 
namely, the closure of the markets, the occasional challenge 
posed by the laws, and the major changes within Jordanian 
society itself. I do not want to use the expression "we are at 
a crossroads," because it has lost its meaning due to overuse. 
The truth is that our country is going through a process of 
change that is clear in all its forms. What you hear about the 
imbalance in the media sector, official or otherwise, represents 
the state that precedes transformation. 
  [Khalil] Is there a state of confusion? 
  [Al-'Anani] Maybe. Anyway, I am not concerned about that. I 
believe that it is natural to be frank and clear in discussing 
this matter, so that everybody can feel that what is happening 
is not a normal situation but a temporary stage that precedes 
stability after the society shifts from one administrative 
approach to another and from a certain type of relation between 
the ruler and ruled to another. 
  [Khalil] How do you think we can meet these challenges? 
  [Al-'Anani] A major discussion has started and should be 
enhanced about the role of the media in a changing society. How 
should it be? How can we reconcile the homeland's priorities and 
the need for creativity? How can we free creativity from 
bureaucracy? All these questions should be raised at the present 
stage, where democracy is the main feature of change. It is the 
stage of freedom of creativity and expression. How can we 
harmonize the heritage of the past, when expression was 
restricted, with future ambitions to set expression free and 
help it reflect conditions in the homeland? I do not think that 
we can work out magical, practical, and ready-made solutions "in 
a nutshell" for all these matters. 
  [Khalil] To what extent do the Jordanian media reflect the 
democratic experience in the country? 
  [Al-'Anani] I admit that the media are not reflecting it as 
they should. The media should take the lead in that context, 
which they do not do at present. 
  [Khalil] Are parties and national powers allowed to appear 
on 
Jordanian television? What are the criteria governing your 
decision to allow this or not? 
  [Al-'Anani] That has not happened until now. Party leaders 
have not appeared on television. But there are plans to show 
the different parties and intellectual trends on television soon. 
  [Khalil] Speaking about the parties, you know that 
colleagues 
in partisan papers are not members in the Press Association. 
What is your position on this? And what is your role as 
information minister in wrestling more gains and rights for the 
men of the media? 
  [Al-'Anani] We are all going through a process of change 
that 
includes not only official institutions, but also private ones. 
Some of the features of dictatorship exist, even in private 
organizations, and not only in public ones. Party papers for 
example do not publish the views of those who oppose them. We 
have to enhance the democratic experience among all. As for the 
membership of the Press Association, I believe that the law must 
be enforced. In other words, a journalist must decide where he 
stands; he should be a member of the association. Being a 
member of a specific paper is not proper. 
  [Khalil] So you support the stand of colleagues in party 
newspapers? 
  [Al-'Anani] Yes. This is a wrong situation that should be 
rectified. That is why you find non-governmental institutions 
doing something and accusing the government of doing it, just as 
you accuse me now. 
  [Khalil] In light of reports that some journalists are 
being pursued by the security forces and others are being 
brought to trial, and noting that the Journalists Association is 
in a weak position, what are you doing to protect the men of the 
press? 
  [Al-'Anani] I differ with you, sir. Those journalists 
violated the publication law. In the past, newspapers would be 
closed and journalists would be pursued for such an offense. 
Now, however, we use civilized methods: We refer violators to 
the court, which is an independent and a just legal authority. 
If the court rules for the journalist, he goes free, and if it 
rules against him, he is punished like any other violator of the 
law. Let me tell you again--so that you can realize the 
magnitude of the change--that in the past, the journalist who 
violated the publication law was deprived of practicing his 
profession, and his newspaper was closed. 
  [Khalil] But I am talking about some articles in the 
existing 
law, articles that do not suit the democratic practice. 
  [Al-'Anani] Where are these articles? I do not think this is 
true. 
  [Khalil] For example, Publication Law No. 10 of 1993 
violates 
the journalist's right not to reveal to court the sources of his 
information. Also, Law No. 50 of 1971, on protecting the 
state's secrets and documents, denies journalists access to 
information and punishes them if they obtain any document 
described as top secret, confidential, or classified. The 
punishment for revealing any such document is at least 10 years 
temporary imprisonment with hard labor. 
  [Al-'Anani] Do you know of any country in the world without 
secrets that must keep out of publication? What would happen if 
these secrets were published? There are things that are harmful 
to national security, and the courts must be the judge there. 
  [Khalil] Are you saying that media men are not aware of what 
harms national security? 
  [Al-'Anani] I am not accusing anyone. But are there not 
secret documents in the biggest world democracies? Britain, for 
instance, keeps its documents secret and publishes them only 
after the passage of 30 years. 
  [Khalil] Who decides that certain information must remain 
secret? 
  [Al-'Anani] The people in charge, the people in government, 
and those concerned with the protection of the country's 
security and stability. 
  [Khalil] Are the government agreement with the IMF and the 
ordinary trials unpublishable information? 
  [Al-'Anani] Why not? 
  [Khalil] What is the role of the Jordanian media in clearing 
the Arab air, knowing that the leadership in Jordan is calling 
for healing the Arab rift and renouncing Arab differences? 
  [Al-'Anani] I do not think the Jordanian media are giving 
the 
subject of Arab reconciliation the importance it deserves. The 
Jordanian media are busy and preoccupied with domestic affairs. 
  [Khalil] Isn't this negligence? 
  [Al-'Anani] By whom? 
  [Khalil] By all the Jordanian media. 
  [Al-'Anani] If I say yes, you will rush to accuse me of 
interfering in the affairs of the private press and media. 
Forget about that. But as a media observer, I tell you that we 
must engage in a dialogue to define a general strategy to 
highlight the interests of the Arab nation and Jordan in its 
heart. 
  [Khalil] Allow me to change the topic of discussion to the 
area of peace. What is your and the Jordanian Government's 
stand on the project of a Middle Eastern market or network? 
  [Al-'Anani] I do not support this project. I also believe 
that Israel does not support such a project. But our analysts 
are behaving as though Israel is doing its utmost to establish 
such a market and as though the whole thing will take place and 
we will sit down to discuss and make efforts over something that 
Israel does not want in the first place. 
  [Khalil] But Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres 
expressed this view in his book A New Middle East. 
  [Al-'Anani] What Peres is saying is not new. There is a 
difference between the American and Israeli viewpoints regarding 
this point. However, is there an Israeli decision to establish 
a market extending from Iran to Morocco and including Israel as 
a part of it? I do not think so, but they might start marketing 
this big concept to you. They will start by gradually 
introducing such an idea on a small scale to include the 
triangle: Israel, Jordan, and Palestine. This is a region they 
can operate with. 
  [Khalil] Do you support such an idea? 
  [Al-'Anani] Of course I do not. 
  [Khalil] Why? 
  [Al-'Anani] I believe that Jordan and Palestine are not yet 
ready to compete with Israel. Second, I do not believe that 
Israel will approach this project in a balanced and reciprocal 
manner. In other words, it will keep its restrictions on 
imports, trade, and economy, but will want the Arab countries, 
mainly Jordan, to function within this reality. We reject this 
totally because Jordan is a sovereign and independent state. 
However, the problem lies in Jordanian-Palestinian relations in 
light of Israel's control over the economy of the West Bank, the 
Gaza Strip, and the rest of the occupied territories. Israel is 
trying to exploit this situation to involve Jordan. We have to 
be aware of this and confront it because Israel wants to take 
without paying anything in return. 
  [Khalil] Since you are on the front line with the enemy, 
what are your plans to confront the Israeli media? 
  [Al-'Anani] First, we need to talk about the peace process 
with a scientific and mature approach. We need to be frank with 
the people about this subject. We should not allow wild 
imagination to control the ideas of people regarding the topic 
of peace. 
  [Khalil] What do you mean by imagination? 
  [Al-'Anani] There are some fantastic and exaggerated 
theories evaluating Israel's size and fearing the results of the 
peace process. These are based on the false notion that whoever 
goes to negotiate capitulates to Israel's demands. This does 
not apply in the case of the Jordanian negotiators at all. The 
evidence is that more than two and a half years have gone by in 
the negotiating process, and we on the Jordanian track have not 
progressed a single step forward.

  [Text] Informed sources have said that the 
Jordanian-Israeli negotiations, which opened in Washington 
yesterday as part of the meetings of the Jordanian-U.S.-Israeli 
tripartite committee, are addressing bilateral and regional 
economic cooperation. 
  The sources added that the issues that will be raised in 
this 
context include ways of combating insects that cause losses to 
farmers in the Ghawr region, making use of the power linkage 
networks in the region, as well as banking and trade issues. 
  The talks are also expected to address the impact of the 
PLO-Israeli Paris economic accord on the economic agreement 
between Jordan and the Palestinian side and its possible impact 
on the memorandum of understanding between Jordan and Israel on 
economic affairs. 
  Political observers noted that the talks come in the wake of 
a series of contacts and meetings conducted last month between 
Jordanian and Israeli officials in several European capitals, 
including London. 
  Sources have asserted that a senior Israeli official met 
officials in the Jordanian Government and discussed with them 
economic issues, as well as the border and water issues. The 
Israeli side said it was willing to hold border negotiations on 
the basis of Resolutions 242 and 338. 
  Informed sources also said Syria has warned Jordan against 
holding bilateral negotiations with Israel on the water 
question, since it is a vital issue that concerns Syria as well. 
  Dr. Sa'id al-Tall, the deputy prime minister, visited 
Damascus recently and held direct talks with Syrian President 
Hafiz al-Asad.

<F P=106> ["Highlights" column by Fahd al-Fanik: "Unsigned Agreement"] </F>
  [Text] The trade and currency link with the West Bank is of 
great concern to Jordan. It is currently the most important 
economic issue because what is agreed today will govern this 
relationship for many years to come. However, Jordan continues 
to refrain from entering the real battle. 
  The interest in the Jordanian-Palestinian economic agreement 
is exaggerated. This agreement has not been signed because the 
Palestinian leadership does not consider it a priority, being 
busy pursuing more important things. It must be said that 
points in the draft agreement which the Palestinian leadership 
said needed more study are of no concern to anyone and can be 
deleted, and therefore, the delay in signing the agreement is 
intentional. 
  We say that the Jordanian interest in the economic agreement 
with the PLO is exaggerated because even if it takes place, it 
will be no more than a moral obligation, nonbinding and 
inapplicable except in as much as Israel allows. The autonomy 
government is not empowered to negotiate with Jordan and reach 
agreements with it because it has no foreign policy powers and 
no sovereignty to reach agreements with states. Thus, the 
agreement is no more than an agreement of intentions with the 
PLO in Tunis and not with the autonomous government. 
  Some Jordanian officials have reservations about the Paris 
Israeli-Palestinian economic agreement on the pretext that it 
does not give Jordan the economic advantages it had expected and 
were promised in the 7 January 1994 economic agreement with the 
PLO because the Palestinian side could not obtain more 
advantages for Jordan due to Israel's intransigence. 
  However, the question is: Why does Jordan expect the 
Palestinian side, which is weak and has no sovereignty, to 
obtain for it rights and economic advantages in the West Bank 
and Gaza? Why doesn't Jordan seek these rights and advantages 
within the joint Jordanian-Israeli-U.S. economic committee? 
When will the Jordanian officials stop evading confrontation 
and blaming the Palestinian side for accepting an agreement that 
gives priority to Israel's interests at Jordan's expense? 
  It is no secret that Mr. Yasir 'Arafat does not want strong 
economic relations with Jordan because he wants an independent 
state and is apprehensive of real or imaginary Jordanian 
domination. Dr. 'Abd-al-Fattah Abu-Shukr, member of the 
negotiating Palestinian delegation, said that the delegation did 
not receive any instructions from the PLO leadership during the 
first five rounds of talks and that the delegation did not 
return to Tunis at all during these rounds, contrary to what 
used to take place during negotiations with Jordan when 
facsimile messages were exchanged with Tunis every half hour 
because Tunis had apprehensions with respect to Jordan that did 
not exist toward Israel.

<F P=106> [By P.V. Vivekanand] </F>
  [Text] Amman--The government and the Lloyds Register are 
continuing negotiations and a deal could be concluded before the 
end of the month to have the London-based agency set up a 
presence at the port of al-'Aqabah to observe the enforcement of 
sanctions against Iraq, informed sources said Monday. 
  In the meantime, offshore interceptions and inspections of 
all al-'Aqabah-bound ships continue at the Tiran Straits in the 
mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba; but no diversion of vessels were 
ordered by the American-led warships enforcing the sanctions in 
the last one month, officials said. 
  A negotiatng team from the Lloyds Register visited Jordan 
two 
weeks ago for talks with Jordanian officials on the land-based 
sanctions verifications regime and reached agreements on most 
basic points, but several "minor points remain floating" in the 
air, one source told the Jordan Times. 
  "There are no major points of conflict and we expect major 
progress by next week," said the source. Another source said 
Lloyds Register officials were drafting the necessary agreements 
and these could be ready by next week. 
  "Both sides have agreed on most of the key points and a few 
issues, which are very minor in nature, remain to be sorted 
out," said the source without elaboration. 
  Under the agreed formula, Lloyds surveyors will be included 
in a committee made up of port and customs officials and a 
representative of the concerned clearing agent which will 
monitor all Jordanian imports and exports through the port as 
part of the customs procedures dictated by Jordanian law. 
  The Lloyds representatives could freely observe whether the 
goods tally with the concerned documents accompanying them and 
send reports to the U.N. Sanctions Committee. Beyond that, 
Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali has said, Jordan will not 
accept any "inspection" of Jordanian imports and exports since 
the Kingdom is not under any sacntions and is free to import 
whatever it wants. 
  All cargo addressed to consignees in Iraq will be inspected 
separately for adherence to the sanctions and those consignments 
will be allowed to leave the port only after approval by the 
Sanctions Committee wherever necessary. 
  Food and medicine are exempt from the sanctions and 
therefore 
do not need sanctions approval. Other items related to the 
production and distribution of food and medicine are also 
allowed, but they should have prior Sanctions Committee approval. 
  It is expected that the Lloyds presence at al-'Aqabah will 
cost nearly $3 million for the first year. Importers will pay 
the cost on the basis of the tonnage of their imports and the 
amount will be remitted to a special account, which in turn will 
be linked with an as-yet undesignated escrow account at the U.N. 
at the disposal of the secretary-general. 
  The sources noted that such an arrangement will have clear 
transparency of the amount that Jordanian importers pay and 
allow the importers to apply for compensation of equal amount 
from the U.N. 
  Diplomatic sources said the United States, the most hardline 
advocate of the sanctions against Iraq, had agreed to most of 
the points. No details were immediately available of 
disagreements if any. 
  Washington accepted the proposal to replace the sea-based 
inspection of al-'Aqabah-bound vessels by U.S. warships with a 
land-based verification system in April. The acceptance came 
after Jordan made its return to peace talks with Israel 
conditional on an end to the inspections, which cost the Kingdom 
more than $1 billion since the sanctions against Iraq were 
imposed in August 1990. 
  Importers and shipping agents have welcomed the Lloyds 
arrangements saying it would not only ease their financial 
burdens and logistical problems but will also encourage shipping 
lines to resume their regular services to al-'Aqabah.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Secretariat of the General People's </F>
Committee for Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation; 
date not given] 
  [Text] The U.S. assistant secretary of state has been 
quoted expressing his country's concern over the nuclear 
activities of a number of states, among which he mentioned the 
Great Jamahiriyah. 
  The Secretariat of the General People's Committee for 
Foreign 
Liaison and International Cooperation would like to remind the 
American official of the remarks made by the Directer of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency while visiting the Great 
Jamahiriyah at the head of a team of the agency's experts in 
January 1993 confirming what we have repeatedly announced and 
affirmed about Libya's noninterest in possessing weapons of mass 
destruction This prompted it to sign the nuclear 
nonproliferation treaty and to participate in all conferences 
seeking to ban the use or the threat to use weapons of mass 
destruction. 
  What has been said by the assistant secretary of state 
irrefutably confirms that nobody is able to believe the claims 
of the United States and this therefore erodes its credibility 
before the peoples of the world. Instead of warning the Great 
Jamahiriyah, this official should have referred to his country's 
measures against the Zionist entity which refuses to sign the 
nuclear nonproliferation treaty. Moreover, western sources 
friendly to that entity confirm its possession of nuclear 
warheads. Instead of warning it, the United States is supplying 
it with means to enable it to intimidate the states of the 
region by the threat of using those weapons against them. 
  The tone of warning and intimidation is no longer useful 
against the Great Jamahiriyah. American officials spare no 
opportunity to include its name whenever they circulate false 
and unfounded accusations.

  [Text] Mr. Muhammad al-Amin Khalifah, the chairman of the 
Arab Parliamentary Union and the speaker of the Transitional 
National Assembly [TNA], has called on the brothers in Yemen to 
respect the cease-fire resolution to stop the bloodshed and to 
save the resources of the sons of Yemen. Mr. Khalifah expressed 
hope that the Yemenis will embark on an objective dialogue to 
arrive at a lasting solution to the crisis and an agreement 
acceptable to all the brothers in order to consolidate stability 
in their country and work toward reconstruction and development. 
  Khalifah pointed out that the Arab homeland, which has been 
observing the strife in Yemen, aspired to see the role of a 
strong and united Yemen in supporting the march of the Arab and 
Islamic nations, in light of the stability which would be 
achieved by its sons. 
  The chairman of the Arab Parliamentary Union called on the 
Arab parliamentarians to direct all their efforts towards 
containing the crisis, overcoming its negative effects, and 
supporting the peace and reconstruction efforts. He appealed to 
the brothers in Yemen on the need to heed the voice of reason 
and wisdom, for which they had been renowned, and to deny the 
opportunity to anyone intending to ambush the Arab and Islamic 
nation, endeavoring to squander its resources and destroy its 
unity.

  [Text] Algiers, June 8 (AFP) -- Gunmen shot dead three 
people as they tried to prevent a car bomb attack against a 
hotel in an Algiers suburb, before the blast seriously wounded 
three others, the EL WATAN daily reported Wednesday [8 June]. 
  The three men gunned down were all guests at the El Andalous 
hotel in the Eucalyptus district, a Moslem fundamentalist 
bastion of the capital, which was targetted on Monday night. 
  The bomb placed in the boot of the vehicle then exploded, 
badly injuring three people and causing major damage, the 
newspaper reported. 
  The blast was the third car bomb attack since Islamic 
extremists began a guerrilla war against the Algerian 
authorities early in 1992 and subsequently began targetting 
civilians as part of their campaign. 
  More than 3,000 people are estimated to have been killed in 
battles between armed gangs and security forces and in terrorist 
attacks, which began after the army in January 1992 cancelled a 
general election the now outlawed Islamic Salvation Front was 
poised to win.

  [Text] The main opposition Union of Democratic Forces [UFD] 
lost several of its members yesterday. Some of them slammed the 
door and decided to form another political organization, called 
the Movement of Independent Democrats [MDI]. (Abel-aid Ould 
Kebde), the new party's leader, explains here to Salem Meshbouh 
Salem the reasons for his decision to pull out of the UFD: 
  [Begin recording] [(Kebde)] We are of the view that the UFD 
no longer provides us leadership, because it now serves merely 
as a shock absorber that enabled the government to carry out 
painfulessly, under the most ideal political and social 
conditions, reforms which in the final analysis were not reforms 
at all -- and I think the present frustrations of the 
independent press clearly show to what extent authoritarianism 
has surged back. All in all, when one takes stock of the 
democratization process, not much is left. 
  [Salem] Does this mean that the other movements which have 
supported you so far -- the Party for Liberty, Equality, and 
Justice and the [word indistinct] movement -- have also pulled 
out? 
  [(Kebde)] I think you are aware that we are right at the 
beginning of this process, and I understand that consultations 
between these two movements are under way. It appears that 
within the next 24 to 48 hours they will announce their 
decisions -- which could be to remain with the UFD. As I said, 
we are at the beginning of a process which could in due course 
involve other forces which were originally outside the present 
UFD, or informal forces formerly within that organization. I do 
not think it is possible to predict what is likely to happen 
next. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Addressing a large and very enthusiastic 
gathering this morning of the people of Kokiluyeh va Buyer, 
Ahmad Province, His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i said: [passage 
omitted] God is not happy with the tribal disputes in this 
province; and I, as your brother, am not happy with this 
situation either. Such unacceptable customs should be abandoned. 
  His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i criticized and rejected 
tyranny against women and girls in some regions of this province 
and said: Islam hates and detests any man who subjects his wife 
or daughter to cruelty. The Prophet of God condemns any man who 
relies on his physical ability to oppress a woman. The ugly and 
un-Islamic tradition practiced in some regions of the province, 
where girls are forced to marry against their will, must also 
end, because God's blessings are conditional and will only come 
to those who observe Islamic ethics and divine instructions. 
  Referring to the all-embracing propaganda and political 
efforts of the enemies of Islam and the intensification of the 
economic sanctions against the country, the leader of the 
Islamic revolution said: The enemy is trying to make the Iranian 
people despondent, to turn their backs on Islam. The enemy 
intends to create division among the people and the officials 
and intends to weaken the spirit of work and endeavor among the 
people. Despite all the hostile efforts against Islam's 
sovereignty, the spirit of faith, enthusiasm, allegiance to the 
Islamic Republic, hope for the future, and determination to 
continue the path of the revolution and the imam is observed in 
every corner of Iran. [passage omitted]. 
  The esteemed leader also described the claim of the United 
States to be the leader of the world's nations as a futile 
dream, a false hope. He said: Today it has become clear to the 
Americans, to their allies, and to their rivals in Europe and 
Asia -- and even to affiliated weak states -- that neither the 
United States nor any other power can lead other nations, 
because the nations will never again submit to oppression and 
imposed puppet leaders. The events in Palestine, in Africa, and 
in Europe demonstrate that Westerners -- particularly Americans 
-- cannot control the world. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Castro Turns Down Iranian Invitation </F>
To Form Axis To Confront United States"] 
  [Text] Tehran, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Well-informed 
Iranian sources said yesterday that Cuban President Fidel Castro 
has "diplomatically" turned down an Iranian invitation to form a 
new axis "to confront what the invitation termed U.S. 
imperialism's domination of the world." 
  The sources added that Castro proposed selling sugar and 
tobacco to Iran at low prices in return for 500,000 barrels of 
oil a year. 
  The Iranian proposal was submitted to Cuba by Construction 
Jihad Minister Gholam Reza Foruzesh, who has just concluded his 
visit to Havana, where he met with Castro for 40 minutes. 
During the meeting he handed Castro a message from Iranian 
President Hashemi-Rafsanjani. 
  The content of Hashemi-Rafsanjani's message has not been 
revealed. sources in Tehran, however, pointed out that the 
message reflected the new policy drawn up by Iran aimed at 
creating a new bloc of what it termed "struggling states" under 
its own leadership. In addition to Cuba, the countries 
concerned include North Korea, Iraq, Libya, Yemen (Sanaa), 
Sudan, Jordan, and Qatar. The idea came first from extremist 
elements associated with 'Ali Khamene'i, guide of the Iranian 
republic, who believes that Hashemi-Rafsanjani's policy of 
seeking to achieve accord with the West has produced no positive 
results. 
  The aim of forming this bloc, which -- according to the 
extremist elements -- seeks to extend its authority over the 
Nonaligned Movement, is to force the West in general and the 
United States in particular to reconsider its policy aimed at 
isolating Iran. 
  Support for the Pyongyang-Havana-Tehran axis comes from a 
group of black U.S. Muslims who set up offices in Tehran in 
1980. This group owns one of the English dailies published in 
Tehran by the "KEYHAN companies group," stronghold of extremists 
in Iranian media services. 
  The idea of forming an axis with Tehran was not, however, 
taken seriously in the Cuban capital, where Castro has on 
numerous occasions criticized the backward cultural and social 
policy of the Iranian mullahs. 
  Castro also rejected Iranian claims that Tehran would fill 
the "gap" left after the breakup of the Soviet Union, describing 
this as arrogant. 
  It is noted that the Cuban president is currently seeking to 
initiate a dialogue with the administration of U.S. President 
Bill Clinton to rescue Cuba from the economic deterioration and 
political chaos dominating it, according to analysts.

  [Text] A spokesman for our country's Foreign Ministry 
rejected the claim that Tehran supports one side of the conflict 
in Yemen and is dispatching military assistance to that country. 
He stated: From the start of the conflict the Islamic Republic 
of Iran clearly expressed its regret over the outbreak of the 
war and expressed its concern about the possible separation of 
the Muslim brothers in Yemen. He added: By adopting a neutral 
stance Iran has announced its readiness to mediate. 
  The Foreign Ministry spokesman stressed: Iran is in favor of 
Yemen's unity and resolving the existing disputes through 
peaceful means, bearing in mind the national interests of the 
people of Yemen.

<F P=106> [Weekly political newsletter by Dr. Mohammad Javad Larijani: </F>
"The Saudi Government and Some Major Concerns"] 
  [Text] 1. So far as the national interests of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran and other nations in the Persian Gulf are 
concerned, nothing is more important than the prevailing 
situation in and around Saudi Arabia. We are interested in 
having powerful neighbors and good relations with others. On 
this basis we believe that there are noteworthy reasons to make 
us concerned about the future of the Saudi system at home as 
well as its foreign policies outside its borders. 
  2. Our major concern about the internal situation of the 
Saudi rule stems from the change in U.S. policy in the way it 
approaches the Islamic movement--or what they call Islamic 
fundamentalism. Over the past decade the opinion of Washington 
politicians was often that another type of Islam should be put 
before the Islam of Iran so that the Islamic movement in the 
Muslim countries could be weakened. They believed that in 
implementing such a strategy, the prestige of the Saudi rulers 
in the world of Islam could be counted on and capitalized. 
Therefore, many mosques sprung up in Egypt, Algeria, Africa, 
Europe, and Asia built with Saudi money. However, it was not 
long before all these mosques turned into propaganda centers for 
"Muslim fundamentalism." The Algerian experience is extremely 
interesting. Saudi Arabia extended great financial assistance 
to the Islamic Salvation Front, but apparently when the Muslim 
masses began to move, the Koran and the holy teachings of the 
Prophet become more attractive than remarks by friends like Mr. 
Belhaj and his sort. The conclusion that Washington has drawn 
is extremely important: It believes that artificial movements 
cannot withstand the current Islamic movement which is the Islam 
of Imam Khomeyni, may his soul be sanctified. They concluded 
that in order to harness the Islamic movement, the Egyptian or 
the Algerian models should be used; that is, dictators without 
religion should seize power and violently crush popular 
movements and base the system not only on secularism but also 
adopt an "anti-religion" ideology or doctrine. It is not 
necessary to point out how much this policy is in line with 
America's "democracy" slogan and how disgraceful it is. The 
issue for us is the practical impact that this policy now has. 
It is within this framework that America intends to carry out a 
fundamental change in the Saudi ruling machinery. During some 
of my recent exchanges of views with European statesmen, I 
realized that the issue has gone beyond being only a strong 
viewpoint in the White House and has become a "European" issue 
as well. 
  3. The concerns that are felt should not only be a lack of 
trust in the future of the Saudi regime but also in the fact 
that over the past couple of years, Saudi rulers have played an 
active role in numerous tensions in the region. Looking at its 
differences with Qatar, with the United Arab Emirates, with 
Yemen in the form of border disputes and, finally, its 
provocation of the recent bloody and destructive conflicts 
inside Yemen, the most natural justification that can be given 
for these Saudi acts is that Saudi Arabia wants to inculcate on 
the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council that everyone should be 
under its control, or, in other words, that the said council is 
the "council of cooperation with Saudi Arabia!" Outside of 
their borders, they are afraid of the emergence of strong powers 
in the region. The unification of the two Yemens paved the way 
for the formation of a powerful country with a rich 
historical-cultural background, a vast territory, and a 
strategic position. It is precisely this that is creating 
problems for the Saudi rule! I think that some of Riyadh's 
"nervous actions" outside its borders may stem from its worries 
at home. But nobody in the Persian Gulf should believe that 
anything can be gained from fanning the flames of tension, from 
political instigations, and from territorial claims! Those who 
are weaker are more vulnerable. The stronger a rule, the more 
populous its territory, and the more experience it gains in the 
region, the more hopes for the future of the region it can give. 
I can never forget Sanaa's mistake in supporting Saddam's 
regime during the imposed war. But our nation and our government 
can and should focus their attention on the future and recall 
the heritage of cultural-historical-religious ties of Iran and 
Yemen instead of looking to the past. We should support Yemen's 
unity and oppose any type of separatist movement. Undoubtedly 
this does not stem from hostility toward our friends in Aden but 
from our profound affection for them. We consider the brothers 
in Aden to be citizens of Yemen and see their interests lie in 
the preservation of their country's unity. Our brothers should 
set aside the war and bloodshed and think of the future of Yemen 
as the strongest country in the south Persian Gulf. This is the 
future that awaits them; if only they knew.

<F P=106> [Article by Dr. Mohammad Javad Larijani, Tehran Majles </F>
deputy and member of the Supreme National Security Council: 
"The Satellite, Industry, and Culture"] 
  [Excerpts] 1. Let us comprehend the matter correctly. The 
controversy is not whether the satellite or its dish antennae 
are good or bad, lawful or unlawful! The question is of a 
certain form of social behavior. [passage omitted] 
  2. Let us discuss the matter of social conduct. Can anyone 
deny the deleterious effects of satellite transmissions on the 
mental and moral growth of youth? [passage omitted] 
  3. Now we come to the most crucial question: What should be 
done in the face of serious moral threats resulting from the 
proliferation of the various foreign transmissions. First of 
all, we should be aware that all of us, not only the government, 
but all individuals have a responsibility. If we accept this, 
we can be assured that not only can we help to stem this scourge 
but also to achieve a high level of success. This is only 
possible if all of us consider ourselves responsible, rise up 
against it, and carry out our duties. 
  The people should gain enough knowledge and information on 
the subject. This is a momentous obligation for the scholars, 
intelligentsia, and farsighted individuals in our society that 
should be conveyed by our mass media: radio, television, the 
press, the Majles and so on so that the message is conveyed to 
the masses. 
  Orators and preachers should enlighten the people on the 
issue at every opportunity. The people should not consider this 
issue as simply sensitivity toward all modernism [preceding word 
in English]. [passage omitted] 
  4. Should the government interfere in this matter? There 
should not be the slightest doubt. This is because the 
government is not a mere gendarme in an Islamic system to 
prevent murder and theft. It also has the responsibility of 
combating base thinking to maintain the moral wellbeing of 
society. 
  It is precisely for this purpose that a guardian has two 
kinds of jurisdiction: The first is that which bestows power on 
him and the second is to guide the people. For the second, it 
is imperative that a guardian should be a pious and devout 
theological scholar so that he has the necessary ability to 
guide. 
  What can the government do in this matter? Initially, it can 
make the people more aware of the issue and at a secondary level 
it should formulate certain useful laws and then compile 
regulations for the implementation of those laws. Perhaps it 
may not be so difficult to draw up a guidance program with the 
help of the government. The doubt lies in whether the 
government is able or qualified for such conduct, that is, 
whether it can ban the use of programs carried by foreign 
satellites. 
  Regarding its legal authority, there is no ambiguity on this 
matter in the Constitution. Even in the democratic systems 
based on liberalism [preceding word in English], which on 
principle should be indifferent to values, the issue of 
safeguarding public decency is an exception. It is for this 
reason that in many of the American states there are 
restrictions on the establishment of gambling dens, brothels, 
and how much bodily exposure is permissible. Similarly, a man 
cannot have more than one wife at a time and vice versa. 
However, the implications of public decency are unwritten in the 
West, but in our system they are very clear, sensible and in 
accordandance with the shari'ah. 
  Some people do not consider it proper that the government 
should impose a ban, even though there is no legal hindrance. 
Their main reasoning has two axes: The first is that banning 
the public from acquiring these programs will only increase 
their curiosity, and the second is that the government cannot 
impose laws on this matter, whether at the level of our current 
technology or when the acquisition of such programs becomes 
easier. It cannot go from house to house to supervise the 
implementation of its laws. [passage omitted] 
  5. What is the prospect for the future? One of the 
characteristics of our great contemporary revolution is that of 
operational information. Perhaps information in itself may not 
have progressed greatly, but it has maintained its swift and 
evolutionary course and it is the operational information that 
brought about revolutionary upheavals. [passage omitted] 
  6. To sum up: A. The future of communications is not in 
the proliferation of the use of the satellites by individuals. 
Instead, an important development will be the establishment of 
informational highways with ease, which will place a massive 
capability on informational traffic within reach of the home or 
workplace of individuals with the help of fiber optics. This 
information will not consist solely of television programs, but 
will also open up other vast horizons. 
  B. In the last few years of the 20th century, there is a 
suitable opportunity for the dear people of our country to be 
aware of these developments and to learn the correct and useful 
way of utilizing the current facilities. One should admit that 
the correct way of utilizing radio and television has not been 
spelled out to the people. One should not think that this 
consists merely of switching equipment on and off or knowing 
directions! If modern communications equipment is utilized with 
awareness (regarding information pollution), it can certainly be 
said that the usefulness of human life can be extended manifold. 
  This means that if today individuals can abandon their 
negligence in this field, their apparent lifespan of 60-70 years 
can become more useful than a mere existence of a few thousand 
years or more! In fact, age is a treasure that needs to be 
explored! 
  C. Just as it has been mentioned in the country's plan for 
economic and social development, the Communications Department 
should prepare itself to join the current modern trend of 
information. The social, cultural, and scientific departments 
of the country should prepare the people for optimum utilization 
and on how to remain safe from the harmful effects of satellite 
programs. A legal ban on the use of communications satellites, 
which is a temporary technology for individual use, will stress 
the cultural aspects of those programs that are permitted. Of 
course, the Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
should transmit a selection of these programs some hours daily 
for the benefit of the public.

  [Text] Beirut, June 7, IRNA -- Iran strongly condemns 
Israel's aggression on Lebanon particularly its recent air raid 
on Ba'labakk, a senior Iranian envoy told Lebanese President 
Ilyas al-Hirawi and Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz here last 
night. 
  The envoy, Foreign Ministry director general for Mid 
East-North African affairs, Hojjat ol-Eslam Kazem Khonsari, said 
the Zionist regime's plots were not restricted to Lebanon alone 
but were aimed at all nations of the region. He said the 
Lebanese people have the right to defend themselves against the 
Zionist regime. 
  Khonsari denounced the abduction of Mustafa Dirani on May 21 
by Zionist troops and said the silence of international circles 
against this latest act of state terrorism indicates their 
helplessness vis-a-vis the United States. 
  Dirani the leader of Lebanon's Momena (Faithful) movement, 
was kidnapped from his home in Ba'labaakk by a helicopter-borne 
team of Zionist commandos. 
  Meanwhile, Lebanese daily AL-NAHAR wrote in its Tuesday's 
edition that Khonsari's visit is aimed to bring calm to Lebanon 
and called it an effort to end the Zionists aggressions on 
Lebanon. 
  The daily said that in his meeting with Lebanese officials, 
the Iranian envoy underlined the need for coordination between 
the Lebanese Government and Islamic resistance at such a crucial 
juncture.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] The 51st rotational session of the Persian Gulf 
Cooperation Council, PGCC, foreign ministers concluded its work 
after two days of talks on international and regional issues 
Saturday June 5, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. In a part of the 
statement, PGCC calls for Iran-UAE talks on the disputed islands. 
  Following the release of this statement, a spokesman for the 
Iranian Foreign Ministry yesterday, Monday, June the 6th, said: 
Historical evidence shows that the islands have always belonged 
to Iran, and to resolve the differences the Islamic Republic of 
Iran welcomes holding of talks with the UAE, without any 
pre-conditions. 
  The Islamic Republic of Iran has, however, left the door 
open 
for talks as put forth by the spokesman of the Iranian Foreign 
Ministry yesterday. The spokesman said the invitation extended 
to the UAE's foreign affairs adviser is still valid. 
  The UAE, immediately after the Iran-Iraq war in 1988, 
without 
any hard evidence, claimed ownership over the Iranian islands of 
Greater and Lesser Tunbs and Abu Musa. The claims have so far 
worked as a media propaganda by the regional states and those 
fueling tension and crisis in the Persian Gulf region. 
  The PGCC statement has also protested against the anti-Saudi 
propaganda on the Iranian media during the hajj season. In this 
connection Dr. Mohammadi [not further identified] said: The 
Iranian media enjoys full freedom--something which the 
neighbours should understand. 
  The Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman rejected the claim 
that Iran has supported one of the sides in the Yemen conflict 
and has provided military assistance to that country, saying: 
From the outset of the conflict the Islamic Republic of Iran has 
clearly announced its stance expressing regret over the outbreak 
of clashes and concern over the division and separation of the 
Muslim brethren of Yemen. Also, the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
while opposing any kind of military operations and adopting a 
neutral stance, announced its willingness to carry out mediation 
in the conflict. 
  In this connection he added: Iran is deeply interested in 
preventing the foreign provoked dismemberment of Islamic 
countries and believes that differences among Muslims should be 
resolved through peaceful means. Therefore, Iran deeply regrets 
the killing of any Muslim in Yemen -- whether from the south or 
the north -- and calls on the warring sides to put an end to the 
war and begin talks, which should be aimed at preserving Yemen's 
integrity. Iran also calls on others to show restraint and not 
become a source for the dangerous escalation of the crisis.

  [Text] Tehran, 25 Farvardin [14 April] KEYHAN-E HAVA'I News 
Service -- After it became known that he was infected with AIDS, 
the second secretary of the Brazilian embassy in Tehran was 
expelled from Iran. 
  A Muslim diplomat in Tehran disclosed: Mr. Paulo Madrus, 
chief of the Commerce Section and second secretary of the 
Brazilian Embassy, had just arrived at his position in Iran and 
was hospitalized as an emergency case at one of Tehran's 
hospitals and his blood was tested. The test showed that his 
blood was infected with HIV, and this virus transmits AIDS. 
  It is said that after it was definitely determined he was 
infected with AIDS, the Iranian Foreign Ministry asked the 
Brazilian Embassy in Tehran to send him back to his country as 
soon as possible. His expulsion took place seven months ago 
(last year). 
  In a contact by KEYHAN-E HAVA'I with the Brazilian Embassy, 
an informed source in this embassy confirmed that Paulo 
Madrus, the chief of the Commerce Section and second 
secretary of the Brazilian Embassy in Iran, left Tehran seven 
months ago due to illness, but this source did not mention the 
nature of the diplomat's illness. 
  The same source confirmed that since the return of the 
aforementioned diplomat to Brazil, Hinaldo Esturani, another 
Brazilian diplomat, has taken over as chief of the embassy's 
Commerce Section. 
  In repeated contacts by KEYHAN-E HAVA'I with officials at 
the 
Foreign Ministry to determine if the report that the 
aforementioned diplomat was infected with AIDS and was expelled 
from Iran is true or not, they were unwilling to say anything 
about it, nor would they give any reason for their silence on 
the subject. 
  The aforementioned Muslim diplomat criticized the Foreign 
Ministry's behavior in this regard. He said: Unfortunately, it 
is observed that the behavior of Iran's Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs towards the foreign diplomats living in Tehran, 
especially Western diplomats, is negligent, and this leads to 
insolence on the part of many Western diplomats. 
  It is worth mentioning that last year also KEYHAN-E HAVA'I 
disclosed the infection of a Dutch diplomat with AIDS. It was 
known before this Dutch diplomat came to Iran that he had AIDS, 
but the Dutch Foreign Ministry sent him anyway. 
  In an answer to KEYHAN-E HAVA'I, the Dutch Embassy tried to 
deny that the Dutch Foreign Ministry had knowingly sent a 
diplomat infected with HIV to Iran, but the Dutch Embassy's 
efforts were of no avail in the face of the sharp public opinion 
response in Iran. 
  Based on information obtained from reliable sources, the 
Brazilian diplomat was also infected with AIDS before he was 
sent to his post in Tehran. 
  The Muslim diplomat who gave us the report that the 
Brazilian 
Embassy's commercial attache was infected with the AIDS virus 
said he had no information on whether or not the Brazilian 
diplomat infected with HIV was sent to Tehran knowingly and with 
specific intention by the Brazilian Foreign Ministry. 
  He emphasized that Westerners spread various diseases, 
including AIDS, with their careless behavior. He said: As a 
Muslim, I expect the Islamic Republic's Foreign Ministry not to 
deal passively with Western political leaders and diplomats and 
to make them understand the necessity to observe Islamic values. 
  It is worth mentioning that many Iranian physicians and 
specialists in contagious diseases have expressed concern about 
the relations between foreign diplomats in Tehran and some 
Iranian families. These specialists and physicians believe that 
casual relations could lead to the spread of AIDS among 
individuals who have close contact with foreign diplomats 
infected with this virus, and these kinds of relations could 
involuntarily lead to the spread of the HIV infection through 
the country. Specialists in contagious diseases thus advise 
Iranian families to avoid contact and relations with foreign 
diplomats.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Faramarz Qorabaghi] </F>
  [Text] News Service -- Late in the year 1371 [21 March 
1992-20 March 1993] a report made the rounds among foreign 
diplomats living in Tehran that the consul of the Dutch Embassy 
was infected with AIDS. This report was also published in some 
of the nation's press, but the Foreign Ministry made no comment 
on the publication to this report. 
  Also, last year we saw the quiet expulsion of a Brazilian 
diplomat from Tehran, and again the Foreign Ministry chose to 
remain silent on the subject. 
  The periodic publication of reports of this type shows the 
necessity for careful hygienic monitoring of the foreign 
diplomats living in Iran. Although some of the nation's 
officials believe that it is proper to look the other way on 
this matter, it must be emphasized that the hygienic monitoring 
of foreign diplomats is the lawful right of any country, 
including Iran. 
  Of course, the monitoring procedures must be such that they 
create maximum confidence for the appropriate officials. The 
Foreign Ministry can test the foreign diplomats living in Tehran 
after informing the diplomatic organizations in the other 
countries and coordinating this with the responsible domestic 
organizations, in order to ensure their physical health (it is 
worth mentioning that the fact that the Brazilian Embassy's 
second secretary and commercial attache was infected with AIDS 
became known only after he went to one of Tehran's hospitals for 
emergency treatment). 
  However, the fact that the Foreign Ministry is negligent in 
its monitoring of foreign diplomats in Tehran, especially the 
diplomats from non-Muslim countries, is not the only point 
deserving of criticism. Many other questions also arise. For 
example, why do officials in the Foreign Ministry think the 
publication of reports such as the one previously mentioned and 
providing this information to the public and the media will 
undermine the Foreign Ministry's relations with foreign 
countries? 
  The Foreign Ministry's officials are well aware that the 
media and the press in the Western nations have close ties to 
the diplomatic organizations in their countries. These ties are 
not confined to the exchange of information and reports. They 
even come into play in the incitement of public opinion and 
propaganda controversies; for example, we have seen repeatedly 
that some Western governments, before making a hostile political 
move against Iran, have aroused public opinion against Iran 
through their media. On the other hand, instances have been seen 
where first the Western governments have incited the public with 
litanies against Iran and then their mass media have undertaken 
a propaganda campaign, even going so far as to slander Iran. 
  In Iran, however, the Foreign Ministry behaves differently 
towards the media. With regard to the AIDS infection of the 
Dutch consul, for example, the Foreign Ministry remained silent 
despite its knowledge of this subject, and unfortunately when 
the Dutch Embassy lied in its answer to the publication of this 
report in KEYHAN-E HAVA'I, the Foreign Ministry continued this 
unbecoming silence. Now, some time later, the truth of the claim 
made by KEYHAN-E HAVA'I has been vindicated. Of course, some 
people may think that reports like this are not worthy of being 
published in respectable publications and are more 
characteristic of the sensationalist press. We must emphasize 
that we do not support the sensationalist press in any way, but 
one must not shun reporting on events, and "reality" must not be 
kept from the public. 
  The people and the press are asking: Why, when the Turkish 
Consulate in Urmia deliberately made fraudulent modifications to 
the electrical power meter in its consulate building, did 
Foreign Ministry officials fail to react to this illegal 
activity and put the seal of silence on their lips, as they have 
done in other cases? Indifference on the part of Foreign 
Ministry officials in cases like this is seen by public opinion 
as implicit acceptance and collaborative silence on the part of 
the aforementioned officials, and of course the Foreign Ministry 
does not agree with such an implication. 
  The matter of the expulsion of a Brazilian diplomat from 
Tehran because he is infected with AIDS is not something that 
should be kept from public view. 
  In expelling him, the Foreign Ministry has not made a 
mistake 
whose disclosure it should fear. When in countries like England 
even animals are quarantined when entering the country, it is 
natural that more attention than before should be given to 
health and hygiene in a country with several tens of millions. 
Monitoring the hygiene of foreign diplomats in Tehran is a small 
but very important step in this regard.

  [Text] Tehran, 14 Ordibehesht [24 April] IRNA -- The 
managing director of the Armenian language newspaper ALIK, which 
is published for Armenian compatriots in Iran, said: 
Publications for religious minorities in Iran are very active 
and there are no limitations on them. 
  Albert 'Ajamian, concession holder and managing director of 
the newspaper ALIK, gave an interview in which he discussed the 
social rights of religious minorities. He said: In order to 
understand the status of religious minorities in Iran, those 
advocating human rights may study the Constitution of 
Iran--which systematically specifies minority rights. 
  'Ajamian discussed Armenian press activities in our country. 
He said: Currently most of Iran's religious activities have 
publications, and there are no restrictions on obtaining 
concessions for a publication. 
  He also said: To publish its newspaper, the ALIK Religious 
and Cultural Society uses resources from the Ministry of Culture 
and Islamic Guidance, such as paper ration and printing 
equipment. 
  In conclusion, the managing director of the newspaper ALIK 
discussed the willingness of the Armenians in our country to 
broadcast a program over the Voice and Vision organization in 
the Armenian language. 
  The Armenian language newspaper ALIK is printed in Tehran 
and 
is sent to Armenians in more than 40 countries. 
  This newspaper, which began operating in 1310 [21 March 
1931-20 March 1932], publishes news about developments in Iran 
and the world; commentary, cultural and educational materials 
and reports on Armenians in the world. On various occasions it 
also prints Persian-language supplements.

  [Text] 11 Ordibehesht [1 May] -- Sixty percent of the 
current publications in Iran were added to the nation's 
publications market after the triumph of the Islamic revolution. 
  The First Press Festival News Staff reports that studies 
show 
that 40 percent of the nation's publications were born after the 
year 1368 [21 March 1989-20 March 1990]. 
  In Iran about 80 percent of the publications are published 
in 
the Persian language and the other 20 percent are published in 
other languages, mostly English and Arabic. This study shows 
that science, research, and the social humanities, with 19.2 
percent, is the largest group of publications in terms of area 
of activity. Ranking next are general magazines, with a 
13.9-percent share of the total. 
  The number of publications has increased dramatically at 
several points in the nation's history, including the period of 
the Constitutional Revolution, the era of the peak of the 
triumph of the Islamic revolution and the current period. 
  The year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] is unprecedented 
in the 157-year history of the nation's press in terms of the 
number and variety of its publications, and also in terms of the 
number of individuals employed in this profession. In this year, 
550 different publication titles were published. 
  Based on studies that have been done, the audience for about 
36 percent of Iran's press is the general public. Ranking next 
is publications targeted at various social groups. The women and 
children's group, with 29 percent of the total, ranks first 
among the targeted groups. In the area of specialist 
publications, statistics show that those with university 
specialties are the intended audience for 9 percent of 
publications. 
  Likewise, research on levels of education and the 
correspondence between fields of study and occupation shows that 
68.5 percent of Iran's newspaper journalists have university 
educations, and that 1.6 percent of them studied journalism. 
Most of those with higher education in the journalism fields are 
working as journalists in high-circulation newspapers. It is 
worth mentioning that about 13 percent of Iran's newspaper 
journalists are women.

  [Text] Rabat, June 07 (MAP) -- The Central Committee of the 
Socialist Union of Popular Forces (USFP/opposition) discarded 
the possibility for the party to participate in the government. 
The committee, which held a meeting over the weekend to discuss 
the political report presented by the assistant first secretary 
of the party Mohamed el-Yazghi, renewed attachment to the stands 
it explained in the statement adopted last December saying the 
December statement remains the basic platform for the USFP 
political action as there are no new data likely to dictate a 
change of these stands. 
  The committee which examined the latest political 
developments in light of the appointment of Abdellatif Filali as 
prime minister and the latter's consultations with political 
parties, took note of some of Filali's laudable commitments and 
intentions but saw no sign of a genuine change. The committee 
therefore discards the possibility to participate in the 
government. 
  The political report that was run Monday by the USFP daily 
'AL ITTIHAD AL ICHTIRAKI' on the other hand stressed the need to 
usher in political and constitutional reforms and pointed out 
that the credibility of any government is intrinsically linked 
to the genuine practice of democracy and the genuine respect of 
human rights. 
  The report also deemed it necessary for the government to 
carry on social dialog to reach solutions to pending problems. 
  The central committee of another opposition party, the Party 
for Progress and Socialism (PPS), held an extraordinary meeting 
Sunday during which the PPS secretary general informed the 
committee members on the consultations held by Filali with 
Moroccan political parties.

  [Text] Colombo, June 7 (AFP) -- Security forces Tuesday [7 
June] claimed heavy Tamil guerrilla casualties outside a 
strategic military base in northern Sri Lanka following a rebel 
pressure mine attack at a nearby naval facility. 
  Troops moved ahead of their outer defences at the sprawling 
Palaly military complex on the northern Jaffna Peninsula Monday 
and killed or wounded up to 20 rebels, a military statement here 
said. 
  Troops fired at guerrillas of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil 
Eelam (LTTE) at coastal Madagal village, which forms part of the 
Palaly defences. Palaly is the staging post for air force 
operations against Tigers in the region. 
  The military statement said ground troops also destroyed a 
tractor that was bringing rebel reinforcements to Madagal. The 
statement put the rebel casualties at "15 to 20," revising an 
earlier military figure of 40. 
  The fighting came just hours after a LTTE pressure mine blew 
up a Navy water bowser at the main Navy base on the islet of 
Karainagar, killing one sailor, the statement said without 
giving further details. 
  There have been similar mine attacks and the entire Northern 
Military High Command, comprising nine senior Army and Navy 
officers, was killed in a mine attack at another small islet 
near Jaffna in August 1992. 
  Karainagar is located just west of the Tiger-dominated 
Jaffna 
Peninsula. The LTTE is leading a violent seccessionist campaign 
in the northeast, home to Sri Lanka's two million-strong Tamil 
minority.

  [Text] President Yasir 'Arafat, president of the state of 
Palestine and chairman of the PLO Executive Committee, this 
morning received Mr. John McCarthy the ambassador of the United 
States in Tunis. 
  During the meeting President 'Arafat received two important 
messages from the U.S. Administration pertaining to the current 
situation and the implementation of the Palestinian-Israel 
agreement and also the U.S. Administration's efforts with the 
donor states before the meeting scheduled for 9 June 1994. 
  The meeting was an opportunity to review the current 
developments of the take over of the Palestinian authorities in 
Gaza Sector and Jericho. 
  President 'Arafat had asked the donor states to speed the 
fulfillment of their pledges to enable the Palestinian National 
Authority to discharge their duties and implement their 
obligations in development and construction each of which is an 
urgent and fundamental necessity to strengthen the foundations 
of peace. 
  On his part, the U.S. ambassador expressed the interest of 
the U.S. Administration in the success of the peace process and 
in enabling the Palestinian authorities of discharging their 
duties successfully and as soon as possible. 
  The meeting was attended by Dr Sami Musallam, 
director-general of President Yasir 'Arafat's office.

  [Text] Brother Abu-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'], member of the 
Palestinian National Authority, has announced that brother 
President Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] and his aides will return 
to Jericho and Gaza in late June. 
  In press statements published in the Tunisian capital 
yesterday, brother Abu-'Ala' added that brother Abu-'Ammar and 
senior Palestinian officials will not return to Jericho and Gaza 
Strip prior to the meeting due to be held by donor nations in 
Paris on 9-10 June. 
  It should be recalled that brother president Abu-'Ammar said 
in a statement to a U.S. television network that he will not 
leave for the autonomous areas unless the international 
community quickly fulfills its financial commitments to the 
Palestinian self-rule. 
  In his statements, brother Abu-'Ala' noted that the 
[Palestinian] leadership is facing acute financial problems. He 
added that this issue was raised by brother president Abu-'Ammar 
during a recent meeting he had with a U.S. Senate delegation in 
Tunis. 
  Brother Abu-'Ala' emphasized that the Palestinian 
administration badly needs the required funds to pay the 
salaries of Palestinian policemen and employees, and also to 
rehabilitate and rebuild Gaza and the West Bank, particularly 
since Israel has exploited the resources of these two areas and 
caused immense damage there. 
  Brother Abu-'Ala' also hoped that the Paris talks, which 
will 
follow up on financial and economic issues regarding the 
autonomy authority, will adequately and shortly settle the 
problem pertaining to the disbursement of pledged funds, which 
he said is worrying Palestinian leaders and strugglers.

  [Text] Arab diplomatic sources have told AL-SHA'B that 
while taking part in the conference of nonaligned countries' 
foreign ministers, Iraqi Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id 
al-Sahhaf met with Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa and asked Egypt to 
play a role in unifying the Arab fold, defining the elements of 
pan-Arab security, overlooking the events of the past, and 
developing bilateral ties between Egypt and Iraq. 
  The sources said the Iraqi foreign minister requested the 
reinstatement of the joint action committees for cooperation 
between Egypt and Iraq in all economic, social, and cultural 
fields and stressed Iraq's desire to mend its political 
relations with other Arab countries. He also called for an 
urgent Arab move led by Egypt to unify the Arab fold and clear 
the Arab air. 
  The Iraqi foreign minister affirmed his country's readiness 
for a serious contribution in the future to any measures led by 
Egypt or the Arab League to clear the atmosphere and plan for a 
successful Arab summit. 
  The sources added that Egypt told Iraq of the need to settle 
bilateral problems with Kuwait, especially the Kuwaiti 
prisoners, and to agree on a new method governing inter-Arab 
relations in the coming stage. 
  AL-SHA'B learned that Egypt turned down an Iraqi plan to 
develop bilateral ties between the two countries through 
ministerial committees and that Egypt postponed discussion of 
any issues concerning bilateral cooperation to a later stage.

  [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will 
arrive for another shuttle mission between Israel and Syria 
toward the end of the month. Our political correspondent Gadi 
Sukenik has learned that the political echelons were notified of 
this by the State Department. Our correspondent further learned 
that, in the meantime, peace talks coordinator Dennis Ross and 
his aides continue delivering secret messages between the 
leaders of Israel and Syria in an attempt to reach agreements 
and establish a better basis for the success of the U.S. 
secretary of state's visit to our region. 
  At the same time, Israeli sources denied the reports from 
Jordan regarding an arrangement that was allegedly reached on a 
withdrawal from the Golan. The sources said that the road to an 
agreement with Syria is still long. They believe that the 
report from Amman was designed to justify the Jordanian decision 
to resume the peace negotiations with Israel. 
  Minister Yosi Sarid said today that it can be assumed that 
the negotiations with Syria will resume in the near future, and 
it may be that the next round of talks will be more promising 
than the preceding ones. Mr. Sarid made the remarks during a 
tour of the Golan, and our correspondent Moti Eden heard him 
there.

you know, Lebanon is a country that just emerged from a long 
war. I agreed to become its prime minister because I knew that 
I could make a difference. Today, one and a half years after 
taking office, I can consider that the government achieved many 
of its goals and that as such, it has already made a difference 
as compared with those that came before. 
  [Nasr] So you consider that your action brought positive 
results, overall? 
  [Al-Hariri] Indeed. Very positive results, and this is a 
statement based on fact. First there was the stabilization of 
the Lebanese pound's exchange rate. Only a few years ago, the 
national currency's standing with respect to foreign currencies 
was a prime concern for the Lebanese. Regularly, and in every 
single news bulletin, there were special items monitoring real 
time variations in the local exchange rate. 
  Today, the Lebanese pound is stable and therefore is not an 
issue any more. This is already very important inasmuch as a 
stable foreign exchange market is the very foundation of the 
economy. Without it, there cannot be a successful reconstruction 
plan. 
  [Nasr] The economy may have pulled out of the hole, but 
recovery is still some way off! 
  [Al-Hariri] I never said you could rebuild an economy all at 
once and just wave away war's every disaster. However, results 
achieved so far are very promising. When I came into office, 
the reserves of the Bank of Lebanon were an estimated $450 
million. Today, they exceed $1.5 billion. Not to mention our 
balance of payments which shows a surplus. This is what gives 
Lebanon its almost unique character worldwide, and will let it 
become a large economic hub once again. 
  [Nasr] But all this does not seem to have had any immediate 
impact on daily life. I think in particular of the unavoidable 
threesome: electricity, water, and telephone, not to mention 
the awful roads. 
  [Al-Hariri] I am perfectly aware of people's impatience. But 
these are tasks that require very careful planning. We do have 
a plan, and this plan is being carried out according to a 
specific schedule. Every sector is concerned, including 
services, Beirut's international airport, which was in an 
unbelievable mess; we just finished straightening it up, and 
electricity, which, unfortunately cannot be supplied on a 
24-hour-a-day basis for at least another 17 months. 
  Any such enterprise takes time. You need to plan, call in 
experts, establish preliminary requirements, issue invitations 
to tender, negotiate prices... These are stages you cannot 
bypass, especially in a country like Lebanon, where each 
official has his own prerogatives. Bids from the various 
companies interested in the rehabilitation of the telephone 
network alone weigh in at 500 kg... Now this is what I call 
working! 
  [Nasr] Are not the connections between yourself and the 
reconstruction project for downtown Beirut a little too close 
for comfort? Is not this project a kind of "insurance" that 
would guarantee that you remain "indispensable?" 
  [Al-Hariri] Let me tell you right away that in a democracy, 
no one is indispensable. Institutions remain, and officials are 
hired or fired as part of this very specific framework. I would 
remind you, however, that my group became involved in downtown 
reconstruction well before I was appointed prime minister. 
Furthermore, I consider the government duty-bound to take an 
interest in this. No state could remain passive when the core 
of its capital is in ruins, it could not remain aloof and 
unconcerned just to avoid being charged with doing business. 
  [Nasr] Your very business-like style of government does not 
go down well in traditional political circles. 
  [Al-Hariri] Well, I would say that this is democracy. I 
became prime minister by being a member of Parliament. My 
political opponents are trying to do the same. This is the name 
of the game. Not only in Lebanon, but in all countries ruled 
through democratic institutions. 
  [Nasr] A major factor preventing Lebanese capital from 
flowing back and international investors from regaining 
confidence is indisputably the huge influence of Syria. Have 
you made a deal [last word in English] with the Syrians to 
retain some maneuvering space? 
  [Al-Hariri] Let me tell you one thing in all sincerity: I 
can assure you that since I became prime minister, the Syrians 
have not contacted me once on any issue directly connected with 
internal affairs. Before I took office, like everybody else, I 
was hearing that you could not appoint a civil servant or set up 
a project without Damascus' imprimatur. I am not in a position 
to comment on the way my predecessors did things, but as far as 
I am concerned, there is no truth to all this. 
  In fact, our relationship with the Syrians is based on two 
unchanging features: cooperation in internal security matters 
-- and I think all the Lebanese can see it is effective -- and 
coordinated foreign policies. 
  [Nasr] You happen to be a naturalized Saudi citizen, a 
privilege seldom granted an Arab national by the Wahabite ruling 
family. As the Lebanese prime minister, do you ever find 
yourself caught between Damascus and Riyadh's conflicting 
interests? 
  [Al-Hariri] Contrary to popular misconceptions, Lebanon can 
never find itself in an unpleasant situation with respect to 
Syria and Saudi Arabia, for a simple reason: Its relations with 
these two countries are very different in nature. 
Geographically, Syria could not be closer to Lebanon. We have 
common interests that cannot be dissociated. The two countries' 
populations are very close, and there are many obvious family 
ties. Moreover, many Lebanese people own land in Syria, while 
others work there. This is nothing new; ties between our two 
nations go back a long way. 
  Such is not the case for Saudi Arabia, which has no special 
interest in Lebanon. Riyadh has a very clear foreign policy 
which is limited to its sphere of influence. On the other hand, 
the Saudis help friendly countries, including Lebanon. 
Insisting that there is a power struggle between Damascus and 
Riyadh in Lebanon is ludicrous. I would even add that to my 
knowledge Saudi Arabia has never attempted to exert any 
influence on our country. 
  [Nasr] You visited France several times, meeting its top 
officials, not to mention businessmen, of course. Were tangible 
promises made with respect to funding specific reconstruction 
projects? 
  [Al-Hariri] Relations between France and Lebanon date back 
hundreds of years. The French have a special relationship with 
Lebanon, and so do the Lebanese with France. When a Lebanese 
says he is going to Europe, chances are he will end up in 
France. The reverse is just as true. When a Frenchman comes to 
the Middle East, you just know he will stop over in Beirut. 
There is indeed a very special relationship. 
  As far as tangible promises are concerned, on meeting French 
officials our requests were very specific. For the most part, 
these related to new equipment for internal security forces, the 
provision of spare parts for military equipment, and the 
construction in northern Lebanon of a 450-megawatt power plant. 
Furthermore, we reached an agreement in principle for 
increasing the capital of Middle East Airline. 
  [Nasr] Is there currently a will to renegotiate the 
agreement 
entered into by Paris and Beirut as regards General Michel 'Awn? 
  [Al-Hariri] To tell you the truth, I fail to see how that 
could be. You know that the agreement was concluded before I 
came into office. To my knowledge, none of the parties which 
developed it has shown any desire to have it renegotiated so far. 
  [Nasr] In the Washington bilateral talks, the Lebanese and 
Israelis still cannot seem to agree on anything. Jerusalem and 
the PLO entered into an agreement last September, while Jordan 
seems to be headed in the right direction. If this goes on, all 
Arab countries will end up signing a peace treaty with Israel, 
with the exception of Lebanon and Syria, which will be left 
alone in seeking an "overall solution." Is not Beirut mostly 
waiting for Damascus' "green light" before it forges ahead? 
  [Al-Hariri] Now listen carefully, I will say this only once: 
there can be no peace settlement in the Middle East that 
excludes Lebanon. This is no empty slogan; it is a fact. Even 
if all our Arab neighbors enter into a peace agreement with 
Israel, such an agreement will no be viable without our 
participation. The reason for this is obvious: All opponents 
to the agreement will converge here and will not sit still until 
they have wrecked it. 
  Beside, there is no reason for Lebanon to rush at a time 
when 
the Syrians themselves do not oppose the notion of a peace 
agreement with Israel. Why should we be in a hurry while 
Damascus has formally entered the process and has been overtly 
negotiating with the Israelis? 
  All that we ask for at this stage is full enforcement of 
Security Council Resolution 425, which provides for the 
withdrawal of Israel's army from the border zone it has been 
occupying in southern Lebanon. The Israelis will not hear of it 
and want us to rush into a peace treaty. However, there is 
nothing in Resolution 425 that requires Lebanon to conclude a 
peace agreement.

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
the chairman of the Presidential Council and supreme commander 
of the Armed Forces, has visited the 48 Revolution Camp. He was 
received by the brother commander of the camp, officers, and 
troops. They welcomed the brother leader president and 
expressed their happiness over the visit, which embodies the 
leader's eagerness to observe the situation of the sons of the 
valiant Armed Forces and take care of them. They also expressed 
their high readiness to perform the national duty of defending 
unity and protecting constitutional legitimacy, as well as 
protecting the homeland's achievements and gains. 
  During his visit, the brother leader president got 
acquainted 
with the qualification and training operations in the camp. He 
spoke to the troops, paying tribute to the high morale of the 
personnel of our valiant Armed Forces, which have embodied -- by 
championing the people's will of unity and protecting 
constitutional legitimacy -- the true belonging to the homeland 
and the deep faith in God, the homeland, the revolution, and the 
unity. 
  He added: Our Armed Forces have proven throughout all stages 
that they are the invulnerable shield of the homeland, the 
property of the people, and a tool to protect their 
achievements, security, and stability. The heroes in our Armed 
Forces have championed the Yemeni revolutions of 26 September 
and 14 October. Today, they are valiantly championing unity and 
are protecting it from all the challenges imposed by the gang of 
rebellion and secession that drove the homeland to war to 
implement its criminal secessionist scheme for a handful of 
filthy money and for the sake of its narrow selfish interests. 
  The brother leader president noted that the Yemeni homeland 
is passing through an important, decisive turning point to 
formulate a new era in light of the fortification of its unity 
and embodying the national aspirations to build a new Yemen on 
the basis of justice, democracy, comprehensive developments, 
respect for human rights, and a state of law and order and 
modern institutions. 
  The brother leader and supreme commander also asserted that 
the sons of our people and their Armed Forces have never 
refrained from making precious sacrifices to protect and 
safeguard unity. Unity is a great objective for which the free 
men of the sons of our people have struggled until it was 
achieved in a historic, bright action. Today, they will not show 
reluctance to pursue struggle and make sacrifices in order to 
face the criminal, secessionist gang that is trying to harm 
unity and set the clock back to the situation that prevailed 
prior to 22 May 1990. He noted that the epochs of separation 
have gone and will never return and that Yemen's strength and 
prosperity lie in unity, noting that without unity, there is no 
future for Yemen, because it is the source of pride, stability, 
and progress. 
  The brother president praised our Yemeni people's 
broad-based support for their brothers and sons in the Armed 
Forces in the battle to protect unity and democracy and defend 
constitutional legitimacy. He said this excellent national 
cohesion between our people and Armed Forces, the forces of 
unity and legitimacy, in various parts of the Yemeni homeland 
embodies the sincerity of national affiliation and feelings of 
national responsibility. He appealed for further national 
cohesion among the masses, particularly among the political 
forces and prominent figures on the national arena, to confront 
the secessionist scheme, which was hatched by the secessionist 
gang led by traitor and agent al-Bid and his clique, who sold 
themselves cheaply and wanted to push the homeland into the 
furnace of destruction in order to achieve their selfish goals. 
  The brother president noted the cease-fire violation by the 
gang of apostasy and secession. He said the Armed Forces have 
announced that they will abide by the resolution as of 2400 
yesterday in implementation of the UN Security Council 
resolution. That gang, he said, continued its aggressions and 
provocations against our Armed Forces and launched air raids 
against the positions of our Armed Forces on all axes at the 
time when our Armed Forces, the forces of unity and legitimacy, 
were abiding in full by the cease-fire resolution. He explained 
that the rebellious secessionist gang does not respect any 
agreements or conventions; violates all agreements and treaties 
with its criminal conduct and conspiratorial mentality; and does 
not fear God or care about the homeland. 
  The leader president urged the brother officers, NCO's, and 
soldiers to display further discipline and to deal well with the 
citizens and to offer them all cooperation and care, and to 
treat well their brothers who were deceived by the secessionist 
gang when they join or surrender to the forces of unity and 
legitimacy. He said: Those are your brothers and comrades in 
arms. He noted the wrong indoctrination and deceptive 
propaganda the secessionist gang is trying to promote among the 
deceived ones against their brothers and comrades in arms in the 
Armed Forces and against all citizens in general. 
  He called again on the remaining deceived brothers to 
quickly 
join the ranks of unity and legitimacy and to take advantage of 
the general amnesty law. He said they will be received and 
treated very well and will get all of their rights just like 
their colleagues in the Yemeni Armed Forces.

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
Presidential Council chairman and supreme commander of the Armed 
Forces, has stressed that our country welcomes UN Security 
Council Resolution No. 924 and all its article. He said our 
country has expressed readiness to cooperate with international 
efforts to resolve the crisis in our country. Those remarks 
were made during a news conference held by the brother president 
at noon today. The news conference was attended by 
correspondents of Arab and international news agencies and print 
and electronic news media. The brother president explained said 
that no dialogue is possible with the secessionist elements in 
the command of the [Yemeni] Socialist Party [YSP], but with YSP 
unionist elements. He explained that some unionist elements are 
helpless and controlled by the secessionist elements. As soon 
as the crisis is over, he explained, those unionist elements 
will come out and make their stands public. 
  The brother president also noted that the entry of the 
legitimate forces into Aden will be a political decision. He 
said this is in order to avoid further material and human 
losses, preserve human lives in Aden, and for humanitarian 
reasons. 
  The brother president noted that the future of the genuine 
Yemeni state will be prosperous and developed, based on the 
state's institutions, represented by the legislative authority, 
and on modern and developed laws regulating the activities of 
the new state, such as the local government law, which gives 
wide authorities to governorates, thus easing centralization. 
At the same time, he stressed that promises for applying local 
government jurisdiction will be honored. This is unlike the 
behavior of some YSP leaders, who falsely raised the slogan of 
giving power to local governments and demanded that strict 
centralization be eased and authorities be granted to local 
government. 
  The brother president stressed that the local government law 
will be applied after order is restored and constitutional 
amendments are held. 
  The brother president explained that the YSP secessionist 
elements are demanding and appealing for a cease-fire at a time 
when their warplanes are launching raids on the forces of unity 
and constitutional legitimacy on the entrances of Aden. Their 
appeals, he said, are only meant to draw the sympathy of foreign 
public opinion and to portray themselves as being wronged. 
  The brother president indicated that in light of the new 
world order, our country has welcomed UN Security Council 
Resolution No. 924. This is despite the fact that this 
resolution is considered interference in domestic affairs [words 
indistinct] cease-fire resolution unless [words indistinct] the 
legitimate forces.

<F P=106> ["A Standpoint" column by Salah al-Mukhtar: "The Leadership </F>
and the Requirements To End the Blockade"] 
  [Text] The most significant element in the joint reaction 
from the Iraqi people's various sectors to leader President 
Saddam Husayn's assumption of the post of prime minister is that 
the people are now more optimistic about the future and that the 
next months will see major positive changes in favor of the 
Iraqi people. 
  A quick review of the events of the 17-30 July revolution in 
1968 will show those who want to understand the course of events 
that the leader president has emerged triumphant from all his 
missions, enjoying the support of the Iraqi masses, who took 
more pride in their jihad and their great accomplishments and 
gains. 
  Today, as we enter the last 10 days of the blockade, it is 
no 
longer secret that after the enemy, regardless of its names and 
colors, gave up all hope of succeeding in his conspiratorial and 
hostile plans to divide Iraq and destroy its people, resorted to 
its last card in this conflict, hoping that this card will 
achieve what it had failed to achieve through the comprehensive 
military aggression and barbaric blockade. 
  U.S. awareness that it has lost the logic and the argument, 
that world public opinion, including that of the American 
people, has begun to understand Iraq's positions; and that the 
overwhelming majority of nations have begun to prepare 
appropriate plans to deal with Iraq in the near future without 
the economic blockade, whether or not the United States agrees, 
has made the United States feel that it is inevitably about to 
lose another strategic conflict in a world that has begun to 
slip away from the grip of the United States. Therefore, the 
United States has begun either to use additional destructive 
means or to strengthen the old ones. 
  We will not exaggerate if we say that the principal aim of 
the United States is to increase difficulties in the life of 
Iraqi society by further weakening the Iraqi economy and making 
the people unable to shoulder the extraordinary inflation that 
resulted from the blockade and greed. Therefore, efforts over 
the past months have focused on easing the negative economic 
impact of the blockade so citizens do not despair. 
  But these efforts have clashed with the fact that the 
current 
challenge for the Iraqi people is unlike any other challenge 
that has threatened any people in history. For the first time, 
a four-year comprehensive blockade has been clamped on a nation, 
and for the first time, all intellectual, psychological, 
financial, and economic energies have been used to destroy the 
potential of Iraqi society. Therefore, many solutions were 
ineffective, despite good intentions. 
  As a result, it was extremely necessary for the leader 
president to assume the direct responsibilities of the prime 
minister. His unique leadership capabilities, his deep and 
far-sighted strategic vision, and his comprehensive experience 
in dealing with conflicts and solving complicated crises 
constitute a strong basis for an effective solution to problems 
in the daily life of the masses. 
  Yes, the leader's assumption of the responsibilities of the 
prime minister will guarantee for the people a solution to 
years-old outstanding problems and will constitute a natural 
framework for state organizations to carry out their duties in a 
different way based on resisting the blockade in untraditional 
ways. This is a studied Iraqi reply to the current mobilization 
of hostile energies to destroy Iraq. 
  The battle to break the blockade in the near future is no 
longer a dream or hope, but has become a reality about which the 
enemy -- ahead of the friend -- is talking. 
  The coming months will certainly be decisive. Therefore, the 
blockade-breaking battle, which is considered the most serious 
and the most honorable battle of the Arab fate, along with its 
great changes, plans, and sides, should be defined and 
engineered by the great leader, Saddam Husayn, who dispels 
darkness and despair and creates hope. Let us stand behind the 
leader more firmly, deriving lessons from the Mother of Battles, 
foremost of which is sticking to the symbol of Iraq's unity, 
Saddam Husayn.

<F P=106> [By 'Umar Kallab] </F>
  [Text] In a three-hour meeting held in the portrait gallery 
of the Parliament House, Prime minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali 
presented explanations to House members and answered their 
questions. Reactions differed on the meeting. While some House 
members regarded it as successful and satisfactory, others said 
it was an ordinary meeting in which nothing new was presented. 
House Member 'Abdallah al-'Akayilah asked reporters to rest 
because there was nothing new for them. 
  AKHIR KHABAR acquired the text of the dialogue at the 
portrait gallery. Speaker Tahir al-Masri welcomed the prime 
minister, saying he hoped the meeting would succeed and that the 
prime minister would give the members satisfactory answers to 
their questions, whose highlights had been discussed outside the 
gallery. Al-Masri confined the questions to five points: 
inter-Arab relations, particularly Jordan's relations with 
Egypt, Syria, and Yemen; Jordanian-Palestinian relations; public 
liberties; the mechanism of employment in the government; and 
the Washington tripartite talks. 
  Al-Masri concluded by emphasizing his request that the 
members of the House be thoroughly briefed. 
  Al-Majali began by speaking about Jordanian-Egyptian 
relations, voicing great satisfaction with the recent 
Egyptian-Jordanian talks and the agreements reached, saying that 
Egypt treated Jordan with high esteem and that issues are 
proceeding very well and that Jordan is continually following up 
the implementation of these agreements by telephone. 
  On Jordanian-Syrian relations, al-Majali said that during 
his 
majesty's recent visit to Syria, Jordan was surprised when the 
Syrians demanded more than coordination, alluding to a form of 
unity. Jordan voiced its firm stand on such issue, pointing out 
that it is prepared to promote relations with the Syrian 
brothers provided a calm and objective study is made first in 
order to make any form of a union a success. On the 
Syrian-Israeli track, al-Majali said "it seems" that the Syrians 
have covered a good measure of coordination with the United 
States and it was obvious from their talks that things are 
proceeding well on the Syrian track. 
  On the Jordanian stand on the Yemeni crisis and the official 
media position, which some of the House members regarded as 
biased in favor of the north, al-Majali said: We take sides 
only with unity and legitimacy. Unity has been democratically 
chosen by the Yemeni people and we respect it. 
  Al-Majali criticized 'Ali Salim al-Bid, explaining to the 
House members that when he came to Amman to sign the Pledge and 
Accord Agreement, al-Bid was accompanied by his wife and 
children. However, he kept them on the plane and alighted 
alone. He said that al-Bid's talks with his majesty continued 
until 0200 in the morning. Al-Majali said that al-Bid was so 
late in coming that Prince Hasan took him from the airport by 
helicopter to gain time and that his delay was intended to rob 
the negotiations of the needed time and prevent a discussion of 
all issues. This shows that al-Bid did not want unity. This 
was basis of the Jordanian position. 
  Al-Majali rejected al-Bid's charges and accusations that 
Jordan assisted the north and affirmed Jordan's clear stand on 
this issue. 
  Al-Majali then spoke about the Jordanian-Palestinian 
relations, declaring his dissatisfaction with what is happening. 
He said the talks now are not on the desired level. Meetings 
are held then working committees are formed. Jordan names its 
committee members but the PLO stalls and does not name its 
committee members. In the latest meeting, talks lasted until 
midnight and issues were proceeding satisfactorily but the head 
of the Palestinian delegation, Ahmad Quray', asked the head of 
the Jordanian delegation to give him some time to consult with 
the leadership in Tunis. They went and never returned to sign 
what had been agreed upon. 
  On the issue of public liberties, al-Majali stressed the 
importance of internal security and said that his government 
gives it its utmost concern. He said: I do not deny that there 
are certain excesses here or there but the government is 
determined to respect liberties. He said the number of those 
detained by the intelligence department is 20 and that the 
department assured him that the moment they are interrogated, 
those who prove to be innocent will be released and the others 
will be referred to court. He said the department has allowed 
their relatives to visit them. 
  On the issue of civil service appointments, al-Majali said 
the government explained this in the press and said that the 
civil service appointments system will be revised. He noted 
that this is an administrative issue and it should not be 
interfered with. He said that government will accept any 
observations by House members on this issue. 
  On the Jordanian-U.S.-Israeli talks in Washington, al-Majali 
said that this is an economic issue and has no political aspects 
but an attempt to explore the region's economic and political 
conditions. The prime minister's explanations on this point were 
not sufficient. 
  The House members then directed their questions at the prime 
minister. Twenty members spoke, focusing on both internal and 
external policies. The Islamic Action Front members noted that 
the prime minister was appointing his relatives and in-laws to 
special posts. The prime minister categorically denied this 
charge and challenged them to show him a single instance of this 
kind. 
  Member Bassam Haddadin questioned the government's lack of 
neutrality on Yemen and noted that there were signs of a 
separate solution between Jordan and Israel. Al-Majali answered 
by saying that the position toward Yemen is neutral and the 
government is neutral. He also said that it is impossible for 
Jordan to accept a separate solution with Israel.

  [Text] During a news conference this morning, the president 
of Iran answered questions raised by correspondents from 50 
countries on domestic issues, the country's economy, Iran's 
foreign relations, and other issues. Our correspondent sent in 
the following report: 
  During this news conference the president, noting that at 
present all the country's resources are being employed for 
reconstruction, stressed that the Islamic revolution's values 
are being maintained and strengthened daily. He added: We raise 
our thoughts in connection with the Islamic revolution, those 
who are interested accept it, but this does not mean 
interference in the affairs of others. 
  Referring to the country's hard currency problems and the 
state's economic readjustment policies, he said: The new 
policies announced are a continuation of the same policy which 
aims to keep a single parity exchange rate for foreign currency. 
We plan to clarify the true rate of foreign exchange in line 
with supply and demand. I think that in future the currency 
exchange rate will be fixed at a level below the present market 
rate. 
  Referring to the country's 8 percent economic growth rate, 
the president added: The economic readjustment policies are 
going ahead well, and at present our markets are saturated with 
domestic products. 
  In reply to a question asked by a Lebanese corespondent on 
relations between the president and the esteemed leader of the 
Islamic revolution ['Ali Khamene'i], the president said: I have 
shared the same trench with the leader of the Islamic revolution 
for the past 40 years, and I regard his eminence as the most 
pious individual to be the country's leader. According to the 
president's remarks, some sort of jealousy by the foreign media 
is observed in this connection. 
  A Japanese correspondent asked a question on the possible 
amendment of the Constitution when President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani's second four-year term ends. The president 
replied: We are more interested in implementing the 
Constitution. If I performed my duties well during the last 
eight years, there will be no need to seek reelection. 
  About the satellite receivers and the government's plans, 
the 
president referred to the Majles investigation and refused to 
make further comments in order to deflect any prejudgement. 
  In reply to a question raised by the Voice and Vision 
correspondent on future relations between Iran and Britain in 
the wake of exposure of espionage at the Iranian Embassy in 
London, the president drew the correspondent's attention to the 
negative consequences of this action of Britain. He added: This 
evil deed by the British has created an atmosphere of insecurity 
and mistrust in relations which will have negative consequences. 
We do not wish to see the existence of such an atmosphere among 
countries. Nevertheless, the president stressed: I do not see 
any need to take the initiative to sever ties with Britain. 
  Regarding other foreign policy issues, the president 
referred 
to Egypt as an Islamic country, and efforts are under way to 
resume relations. He said the war in Tajikistan is against the 
interests of its people and the government. He described 
Azerbaijan as the victim in the Karabakh conflict. 
  In response to another correspondent's question, he referred 
to the fact that at the moment all the resources of the country 
are being used for reconstruction. Commenting on the export of 
the Islamic revolution the president said: We announce our 
ideology to the world. Anyone who wishes will accept it. This 
does not mean interference in the affairs of others. 
  While condemning Iraqi violations and the record of the 
Ba'thist Party toward Iran, the Iraqi people, and Kuwait, the 
president criticized the measures taken by the Saudi Arabian 
Government toward Iraq, and Saudia Arabia's lack of coordination 
with other countries of the region. 
  In response to a question from the correspondent of the 
Chinese news agency on the presence of the American editors in 
Iran and the effect on relations between the two countries, Mr. 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani said: Their presence will have no effect on 
Iranian-U.S. relations. However, it can clarify some facts for 
the American people. 
  In response to a question from the AFP correspondent on the 
normalization of relations with the United States, the president 
said: We have not cut our commercial ties, but we give priority 
to countries other than the United States. Regarding political 
relations, we really do not trust the United States. It has 
repeatedly announced its readiness to hold talks, but as we do 
not see any good intentions there, we do not believe it is right 
to begin talks. The releasing of our assets, properties, and 
frozen funds in America could be a way of proving their good 
intentions [hosn-e niyyat]. 
  In response to a question from the correspondent of THE 
GUARDIAN from England about whether Iran regards the British 
Government as an obstacle to the establishment of an Islamic 
government in Bosnia, the president said: There are certain 
indications that the British Government has not cooperated in 
repulsing the Serbian aggression. However, we will leave our 
final judgement to the future. 
  Concerning Iran's position toward the developments in Yemen, 
the president of the Islamic Republic of Iran said: We believe 
in the unity of the two Yemens and we are against its 
dissolution. However, if the people of that country adopt a 
different policy we will have no particular views. 
  Concerning the fictitious [vahi] claim of sovereignty over 
the Iranian islands in the Persian Gulf by the United Arab 
Emirates [UAE], he said: The UAE Government has no acceptable 
claims which it can raise in international organizations. If 
anyone wishes to lay hands [dastrasi] on these islands he should 
pass through a sea of blood. 
  Concerning privatization in the national economy and the 
attraction of foreign investment, the president said: 
Privatization is a policy which started in the First Five-Year 
Development Plan and which will continue to the end of the 
Second Plan. We will continue our work in this field on a 
gradual basis in accordance with the Constitution. 
  About attracting foreign capital to the country, he said: 
From a legal point of view, there is no prohibition against 
attracting foreign capital. In accordance with the law, we will 
give a positive response to the request of all those who are 
willing to invest in Iran. 
  Regarding the money which is owed to the Islamic Republic of 
Iran by a number of foreign countries, Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani 
said: The funds owed to us are not such that they could be 
written off against our debts. For instance, we are owed money 
by Germany for building a nuclear reactor in Bushehr, but the 
courts should pass judgement on this. Or, for instance, America 
also owes us a great deal of money which it must repay. 
  Concerning the successes achieved during the First Five-Year 
Plan, the president said: All the details of the plan and the 
policy of economic readjustment have produced positive results. 
If the price of some items rose this was due to economic 
improvement [as heard]. 
  The president added: During the First Five-Year Plan many 
projects were implemented. Their implementation would not have 
been possible without the policy of economic readjustment. Now 
industrial companies have been formed in every part of the 
country and they are active. The president added: Supporting 
the deprived and the oppressed will not necessitate a reduction 
in the country's economic growth. In the First Five-Year Plan 
we took some measures which have paved the way for greater 
attention to be paid to the deprived areas. Now we also have a 
number of projects for providing social welfare which will be 
submitted to the Majles in the near future. He added: On the 
basis of this plan those whose income is below the acceptable 
[ma'qul] level will be covered by social security. We hope that 
this issue will be completely solved by the end of the Second 
Plan. 
  Concerning the press, the president said: Our expectation 
from the press is that they deal more deeply with existing 
problems. They should help to clarify the issues. They should 
understand the general policies of the system and should act 
within that framework. The president listed sloganeering and 
populism [awamzadegi] as the defects of the press in our country.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Three Experts in Iranian Nuclear </F>
Program Abducted"] 
  [Text] Tehran, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Gunmen have 
abducted a Chinese engineer and two of his Iranian companions in 
southeast Iran. 
  A statement issued by the Interior Ministry in Tehran 
yesterday pointed out that the Chinese citizen, whose identity 
is still unknown, was working on the uranium mining project in 
Rudan. The policy of developing uranium resources is considered 
part of Iran's nuclear program; that is, with technological 
support from China and North Korea. It is believed that the 
three abducted people handle very sensitive information 
concerning Iran's nuclear program. It is not clear whether the 
abduction operation is political in nature or was carried out by 
a gang of robbers active in that area. 
  The abduction of foreign nationals over the past few months 
has become a big problem for the government in many parts of 
Iran. In January, a 22-year-old Australian tourist disappeared 
while en route to Shiraz, capital of the south. There has been 
no news of him since. In February and March, three North Korean 
technicians, said to have been working on military projects near 
the Gulf, were abducted. They still have not been released. 
  Last month, the body of a North Korean man was found near 
Ahvaz, capital of Khuzestan. It was said that someone lured him 
there and killed him for unknown reasons. 
  The government has advised foreign nationals not to leave 
major cities alone. Excursions organized for European tourists 
have been canceled or their routes altered to avoid the danger 
of being attacked by armed gunmen on the road. 
  The Iranian Interior Ministry's report shows an increase in 
all types of crimes, from small-scale riots to organized and 
large-scale armed robbery and murder. This coincides with the 
smuggling of thousands of weapons from Pakistan and Afghanistan 
to all parts of eastern and southern Iran. Sometimes convoys of 
smuggled goods and drugs travel for hundreds of miles inside 
Iranian areas, protected by armed groups and supported by 
personnel carries and tanks. 
  The number of foreign nationals working in Iran is estimated 
at about 18,000, compared with 1.2 million before the mullahs' 
revolution in 1979. But there are also 2.2 million Afghan 
refugees, 1.2 million Iraqi refugees, mostly Kurds and Shiites, 
and at least 1.2 million illegal immigrants from Pakistan, 
Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, and Tajikistan.

  [Text] Tunis, June 7 (AFP) -- PLO Chief Yasir 'Arafat, 
emerging from a five-day isolation due to illness, warned 
Washington on Tuesday [7 June] that he might put off a visit to 
the self-rule enclave of Jericho, a source close to the PLO said. 
  'Arafat told the US ambassador to Tunis, John McCarthy, 
"clearly and firmly" that he would not travel to Jericho unless 
he received a guarantee of international aid for Palestinian 
autonomy, the source said. 
  He said the PLO chairman wanted assurances that the 
Palestinians would receive monthly payments of several million 
dollars to keep self-rule on track in the West Bank town and the 
Gaza Strip. 
  McCarthy, in turn, told 'Arafat that the United States 
wanted 
the Palestinian self-rule authority to take up its 
responsibilities "as soon as possible," the Palestinian news 
agency WAFA said. 
  It reported that 'Arafat, who was "feeling better" according 
to his aides, also met Russian ambassador Boris Shchiborin to 
discuss the aid issue, amid demands from donors of assurances on 
how their money would be spent. 
  They were the first official meetings for the PLO leader 
since he took refuge in his rooms five days earlier because of 
illness. 
  Arafat, coughing and looking tired, said last week during an 
interview with the US television network CBS from the PLO 
headquarters in Tunis that he had a cold. 
  But Palestinian and hospital sources said he had been 
suffering from heart problems and was being monitored by doctors. 
  The PLO chief is scheduled to travel to Jericho in mid-June, 
for a visit during which a 24-member Palestinian authority 
headed by Arafat is due to be formally sworn in to run the 
autonomous areas. 
  WAFA said 'Arafat on Tuesday also telephoned Norwegian 
Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore Godal, whose country heads a liaison 
committee in charge of coordinating the aid. 
  The PLO leader could travel to the French capital on Friday, 
the source close to the organisation said.

  [Text] Brother President Yasir 'Arafat had today a 
telephone conversation with the Mr. Godal, the Norwegian foreign 
minister. 
  The conversation dealt with the latest development in the 
Palestinian-Israeli peace process and the means for bolstering 
it by starting the rebuilding process as soon as possible. 
  They also talked about the International Coordination 
Committee of the donor-countries and the need to fulfill its 
pledges by giving monies to the Palestinian authority in order 
that the latter would meet its development and rebuilding 
pledges in the self rule areas.

<F P=106> [Report by Bitte Hammargren: "Foreign Ministry `No' to </F>
Money for PLO"] 
  [Excerpt] The Swedish Foreign Ministry is saying a 
categorical "no" to contributing to the wage costs of the 
9,000-man Palestinian police force which has the difficult task 
of being responsible for security in Gaza and Jericho. Recently 
the new UN assistant secretary general, Norway's Terje Rod 
Larsen, called for international help to finance the police 
force. Without a functioning police force in Gaza there will be 
chaos, Terje Rod Larsen warned. 
  The PLO's coffers are more or less empty. The situation is 
so precarious that the Palestinian policemen in Gaza are not 
even having their wages paid to them. 
  The Foreign Ministry's message is the same which PLO leader 
Yasir 'Arafat heard from Prime Minister Carl Bildt during his 
visit to Stockholm in November last year. 
  However, Sweden is prepared to help with the training of the 
Palestinian police. 
  The Police High School in Solna has drafted a training 
program, said Alf Samulelson, Aid Minister Alf Svensson's under 
secretary of state. 
  The Swedish proposal, which has been passed on to the PLO, 
is 
about teaching forensic procedures and traffic surveillance.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with PNA member Ahmad Quray', in Tunis, </F>
by Sa'id Mu'addi in the studio; date not given; from the "With 
the Events" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] PNA [Palestinian National Authority] 
member Ahmad Quray', the expenses required by the Palestinian 
Authority are not small, especially those needed to run the 
police. Where will the money come from to cover these expenses? 
  [Quray'] In the long run, the Palestinian authority will 
have no problem coming up with the money. But in the interim, 
the donor nations are duty-bound to make available all the 
finances required for the security forces and other departments 
of the authority. I cannot make sense of this hesitation and 
foot-dragging in providing the finances for the Palestinian 
authority. We cannot overstate the importance of this factor, 
if the peace process is to be kept going and its momentum 
maintained. 
  [Mu'addi] It is now a month since the Israeli-Palestinian 
accord was signed, and yet the Palestinian authority, which has 
to tackle major challenges, has still to become operational. 
What's the delay? 
  [Quray'] We trust the Palestinian authority will be 
operational before long. Cadres of the PNA were supposed to 
begin all their duties in earnest so the transformation could 
become visible to the Palestinian man in the street, and in 
order for the world to witness the Palestinians' ability to 
deliver. The security forces are now deployed, and I think 
ordinary Palestinians are happy with their performance. We 
trust the bureaucracies will become operational soon. 
  [Mu'addi] The tax and customs crews have not begun their 
work yet, which may result in reduced revenues. When will that 
be? 
  [Quray'] At the moment, strictly speaking, there is no tax 
collecting agency to raise money to pay for the PNA's expenses. 
We have no choice but to organize the tax collecting authority. 
We hope that, now that there is a Finance Ministry, this 
department will institute this agency soon. 
  [Mu'addi] How do you propose to quicken the slow pace of 
implementing the economic agreement and opening the Israeli 
market to goods from the West Bank and Gaza Strip? 
  [Quray'] The Israeli side is, inexplicably and inexcusably, 
responsible for the slow pace. We had thought they would be 
anxious to put the agreement in place without reneging on any of 
its clauses, particularly given that, in this equation, they are 
the stronger side. I just cannot understand, nobody can 
understand, why there are obstacles to the export of Palestinian 
agricultural produce to the Israeli market. If this clause is 
not implemented, what else is left of the agricultural 
agreement, or even the trade accord, to implement? Of all 
matters, there should not be any foot- dragging on this thing. 
The Israelis are in a position to settle this issue promptly. 
Their temporization is inexcusable. 
  [Mu'addi] Mr. Ahmad Quray', Thank you so much. 
  [Quray'] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Hasan Abu-Libdah, deputy director </F>
general of the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and 
Reconstruction, by Sa'id Mu'addi; place and date not given; from 
the "With the Events" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Hasan Abu-Libdah, deputy director 
general of the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and 
Reconstruction, good evening. 
  [Abu-Libdah] Good evening to you. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Hasan, has the $5 million -- the first 
installment of the money committed by the donor nations -- 
materialized? 
  [Abu-Libdah] The Palestinian leadership represented by 
brother Abu-al-Lutf [Faruq Qaddumi] signed the transfer 
application about two weeks ago. We should receive that sum any 
minute; it will be used to cover some pressing needs. 
  [Mu'addi] The staff at the Palestinian Economic Council for 
Development and Reconstruction is busy preparing lists of cadres 
and institutions promised by the PLO to the donor nations. Are 
you through with this task? 
  [Abu-Libdah] Let may say, to begin with, that we promised 
the donor nations to revamp certain institutions, and success in 
that effort will decide the fate of international aid. We did 
that job by constituting the Palestinian Economic Council for 
Development and Reconstruction. Other institutions are being 
founded, now that the members of the Palestinian National 
Authority have been named. We delivered on all our legal and 
official commitments demanded by the donor nations. We are now 
waiting for the donor nations to deliver on their end. 
  [Mu'addi] It seems that this week the donor nations will 
convene a session in Paris. What is their agenda? Will the 
matter be settled there? 
  [Abu-Libdah] That will be a meeting of the secretariat of 
the donor nations. It will address a number of the issues that 
have been preoccupying us. They will consider our effort to 
draw up a budget for the national authority. Hopefully, we will 
be able to convince these nations to make good on the promises 
they made in January, 1994 and to plug the anticipated deficit 
in the budget of the Palestinian Authority, both regarding the 
Palestinian police and the central administration. Beyond that, 
we are preparing a number of documents, through which we hope to 
fill the needs of the authority so it can begin its operation. 
Let me make it clear that, since it signed the Oslo accord, the 
Palestinian side has done all it can to meet the conditions 
required to qualify for the international aid that was pledged 
to us. We are at a crossroads. If the donor nations fail to 
meet their obligations, we will be hard pressed to fulfill our 
commitments toward the Palestinian-Israeli agreement. In my 
opinion, the peace process must not be built solely on verbal 
promises. We are at a stage when we most need for the verbal 
pledges to be converted into reality. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Hasan Abu-Libdah, deputy director general of 
the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and 
Reconstruction, thank you. 
  [Abu-Libdah] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Report by radio correspondent Ahmad 'Ubaydat; from the </F>
"With the Midday Events" program] 
  [Text] In a news conference held by Hasan Abu-Libdah, 
deputy director general of the Palestinian Economic Council for 
Development and Reconstruction, PECDAR, at the PECDAR 
headquarters in al-Barid suburb, northern Jerusalem, Dr. 
Abu-Libdah expressed the hope that all problems hindering the 
payment of funds by donor states will be overcome within the 
next few weeks so that the payments can be devoted to production 
and work, and to set up the infrastructure and the 
establishments of the Palestinian authority. He added: 
  [Begin Abu-Libdah recording] Since the signing of the 
agreement, several quarters have raised Palestinian expectations 
concerning what will come out of this agreement economically. 
The donor states pledged more than $2 billion last October, and 
renewed pledges of more than $643 million last January. Five 
weeks after signing the agreement, we have received only $5 
million deposited in bank account in Cairo to pay part of the 
Palestinian police force's salaries. We signed an order to draw 
nearly $6.5 million two weeks ago from the funds available with 
the bank, and we have not received anything so far. We expect 
to receive this sum soon. 
  Now the international community is being tested. Either we 
cooperate, on both the Palestinian and international levels, to 
realize the requisites for implementing this agreement and the 
donor countries will fulfill their commitments, or we will 
together witness the collapse of the peace process on the 
Palestinian-Israeli level. The Palestinian National Authority 
will not be able to carry out its duties in Gaza and Jericho and 
meet its commitments toward the sons of our people in terms of 
services and the expected economic progress -- it will not be 
able to fulfill these commitments if it does not overcome the 
budget deficit and if it does not receive enough support to 
carry out a host of vital projects on which we have been working 
for the last few months. [end recording] 
  Answering a question on whether the budget of the 
Palestinian 
Authority was endorsed by the Palestinian leadership, and how 
much this budget is, Dr. Abu-Libdah said: 
  [Begin Abu-Libdah recording] Yes, the budget has recently 
been endorsed by the Palestinian leadership. We are speaking 
about a budget that begins with this month and ends late this 
year. It is more than $360 million if we add the requirements 
of the Palestinian police force to this budget. Without the 
budget of the Palestinian police force, it will be about $220 
million. Out of this sum, there is more than $126 million in 
expected deficit. As for the police budget, the situation is 
much worse than this. [end recording] 
  The temporary liaison committee of the donor countries will 
convene a meeting in Paris next Thursday. The Palestinians will 
present the Palestinian budget for 1994, which was worked out in 
cooperation with the World Bank and the International Monetary 
Fund.

  [Text] After holding his first meeting with 
representatives of the autonomy in Jericho, Environment Minister 
Yosi Sarid said that considering the prevailing conditions, he 
found the Palestinian Authority organized. Sarid asserted that 
Israel had no complaints with regard to Palestinian control over 
the area. Sarid was speaking after a meeting with several 
Palestinian officials, including Faysal al-Husayni, Jibril 
al-Rujub, and a representative from the Gaza Strip. 
  The meeting was held at the al-Aqsa base, formerly known as 
the Hanan army camp. After the meeting, Yosi Sarid said it had 
been held with the approval and encouragement of Prime Minister 
Rabin. Sarid pointed out that issues related to Jerusalem were 
not raised at the meeting in Jericho, nor did the participants 
discuss the order prohibiting Jibril al-Rujub from leaving the 
Jericho area. In reply to a question, Minister Sarid said that 
negotiations for continuing the peace process would resume soon. 
  Faysal al-Husayni said that the atmosphere at the meeting in 
Jericho had been positive, noting that problems pertaining to 
the daily life of the Palestinian populace had been discussed. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1100 GMT on 8 June 
adds: 
"Referring to Orient House in East Jerusalem, Sarid said that 
its status will not change and that all Palestinian Authority 
institutions will be located only in the Gaza and Jericho. 
  ["Minister Sarid reprimanded the settlers at the ancient 
synagogue in Jericho for their provocative behavior toward the 
Palestinian policemen, but noted that he does not propose 
evacuating them from the site. Our correspondent Moti Amir 
reports that two armed Israeli security guards are posted at the 
entrance to the synagogue. According to a military source, 
these are soldiers in civilian clothes, and their presence was 
coordinated with the Palestinians. The settlers claim that the 
two were hired as security guards to protect them. 
  ["Sarid noted that Former Chief Rabbi Shlomo Goren's halakic 
edict sentencing 'Arafat to death is serious. The man is 
deranged, Sarid said, and he should not be taken seriously 
because his status is of no relevance."]

  [Text] Palestinian leaders are continuing widespread 
political activities in East Jerusalem, which are coordinated 
with the Palestinian Authority in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
The Palestinians are now saying that they are prepared to renew 
the negotiations with Israel on the transfer of authorities in 
the other West Bank towns. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Amir] The furor surrounding the letter 
written by Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has led to a 
confidence crisis among Palestinian leaders. The affair has 
been exploited by Palestinian supporters of the peace process 
who oppose the Gaza-Jericho First agreement and believe that it 
is detrimental to the Palestinian cause. Faysal al-Husayni, as 
if to highlight the political activities at Orient House, 
received a delegation of foreign consuls in his office and 
Palestinian leaders continued yesterday to hold discussions on 
Jerusalem's current situation as well as its future. A 
Palestinian source pointed out that although the famous letter 
sent to the Norwegian foreign minister was not addressed to the 
PLO, the letter's contents had undoubtedly been coordinated with 
the PLO. To prove his point, the source noted that he had a 
copy of the letter before it was signed by Foreign Minister 
Peres, which was dated 9 September. 
  Jamil al-Tarifi, a member of the higher liaison committee 
and 
one of 'Arafat's closest aides, yesterday emphasized that at the 
time, the letter of commitment guaranteed that the Palestinian 
delegation could carry out the political activities in East 
Jerusalem that were necessary in order to conduct negotiations 
with Israel. Al-Tarifi asserted that it was impossible to 
separate the political activities of PLO institutions in East 
Jerusalem and the activities of the autonomy institutions, which 
will indeed be located in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, as 
stipulated by the agreement. 
  [Al-Tarifi, in English] Everybody knows that we have many 
institutions in Jerusalem. It will be as it is, and of course 
it's a Palestinian institute and we will not change anything on 
it. So, nobody can cut the relations between the Palestinians 
and their leadership, which is PLO and one of its organizations 
PPA [sentence as heard]. 
  [Amir translates above remarks into Hebrew and continues] 
Al-Tarifi expressed the assessment that now, following the 
establishment of the Palestinian Authority, the negotiations 
with Israel on the transfer of authorities could be resumed. 
Al-Tarifi said that the Palestinians would demand authority 
over more than the five spheres of health, education and 
culture, tourism, social welfare, and direct taxation stipulated 
by the Gaza-Jericho First agreement. 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0500 GMT on 8 June adds 
that 
"the PLO has rejected an Israeli proposal to release hundreds of 
Palestinian prisoners tomorrow after Israel demanded that the 
prisoners remain in the Gaza Strip before returning to their 
homes until their original prison terms were over. This was 
stated by Jamil al-Tarifi, a member of the Palestinian 
Authority. Al-Tarifi said that Yasir 'Arafat had instructed him 
over the telephone yesterday to reject the release proposal and 
said that the Israeli offer contravened the Cairo agreement. He 
expressed the hope that this was merely a misunderstanding and 
that an agreement would be reached on the release of the 
Palestinian prisoners."]

  [Text] Jerusalem, June 8 (AFP) -- The PLO has rejected an 
Israeli offer to release 2,500 Palestinian prisoners on 
condition that they serve out their time in the self-rule area 
of Gaza, a member of the Palestinian Authority said Wednesday [8 
June]. 
  "The Israeli conditions are to send them to Gaza to finish 
their sentences," authority member Jamil al-Tarifi told AFP. 
  "During this time they would not be under police custody or 
in prison they would just have to stay in Gaza." 
  PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat had spurned the offer, al-Tarifi 
said. 
  "According to the Cairo agreement for autonomy, 5,000 were 
to 
be released as a first step with no such conditions" he pointed 
out. 
  "The prisoners also refuse this option." 
  Al-Tarifi said Israel was prepared to free 2,500 inmates on 
Thursday provided the PLO agreed to keep them all in Gaza. "As 
far as we know they will now not be released." 
  'Arafat had appointed 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya, who took part 
in the self-rule negotiations in Egypt, to head a coordinating 
committee for security which will review the prisoner problem 
with the Israeli authorities. 
  Al-Yahya arrived in the autonomous enclave of Jericho on 
Tuesday. 
  About 8,000 Palestinians are still held in Israeli jails. 
Out of the 5,000 due to be released within five weeks of the 
signing of the May 4 self-rule deal, only 1,700 have so far been 
set free. 
  Israel has given no reasons for the hold up nor confirmed 
that it had offered to free 2,500 with the above conditions.

<F P=106> [Report by Linda Sherzer -- italicized passages in English; </F>
speakers identified by on-screen caption] 
  [Text] Palestinian leaders in East Jerusalem today accused 
Israel of violating their rights by restricting their political 
presence in the city. Our correspondent Linda Sherzer reports 
from a meeting that took place at Orient House today: 
  [Begin recording] [Sherzer] When foreign consular officials 
came to Orient House for a briefing from the Palestinians 
regarding the situation in the city, they were told that, 
excluding Foreign Minister Peres' letter on Jerusalem, Israel is 
trying to undermine the Palestinian status in the city. At the 
same time, they denied claims that Orient House has become a 
colony of the autonomy directorate. 
  Are you effectively running the autonomy from these 
offices in East Jerusalem? 
  [Faysal al-Husayni] No, no, no, not at all. 
  [Sherzer] Despite the Israeli warnings that it might shut 
down Orient House and other Palestinian institutions, al-Husayni 
and his colleagues are determined to strengthen their status in 
the city. In a meeting at Orient House last night, the 
participants decided to recommend that a special fund be set up 
to support the Palestinian status in the city, mainly through 
constructing residential buildings on waqf-owned land. 
Al-Husayni seeks to establish a special council on Jerusalem 
affairs and will devote himself to this issue alone. It was 
further declared that institutions such as this represent all of 
the Palestinians, not only the residents of Jerusalem. 
  [Mahdi 'Abd-al-Hadi] No Palestinian National Authority 
can maintain its credibility, its future, and its -- what you 
call it -- law and order position without its linkage to 
Jerusalem. And you cannot close the file of Jerusalem by 
telling us: this institution yes, this maybe, and this is 
questionable. It is not a question of institution. It is a 
question of life and death for us. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] The formation of the Union of Palestinian 
Contractors [Ittihad al-Muqawilin al-'Arab] was announced in 
Tunis yesterday, with its main headquarters in Jerusalem. 
During its meetings, which were held in Tunis over the last two 
days, the union's constituent conference elected the union's 
council, which includes 15 members, and appointed five advisers 
to the council. 
  In a final statement issued after its meetings, the 
conference stressed the need to organize Palestinian contractors 
in the service of the process of development and construction in 
the liberated Palestinian territories. The statement reads: 
  The new situation which emerged after the peace agreement 
and 
the declaration of the national Palestinian authority on the 
land of Palestine has brought a new reality to the Palestinian 
people and its economic activities, including Palestinian 
enterprises which were disbanded into a number of unions and 
associations in and out of the homeland because of occupation 
circumstances and the division of the Palestinian land. 
[passage omitted] 
  The constituent conference of the Union of Palestinian 
Contractors was held 30 May-1 June 1944 in Tunis, under the 
chairmanship of the president of the state of Palestine, Yasir 
'Arafat. The conference was attended by a number of contractors 
from inside and outside the homeland, a number of guests and 
observers from several countries and international 
establishments, a number of ambassadors in Tunis and 
representatives of a number of banks and financial and 
development establishments. [passage omitted] 
  Palestinian contractors taking part in the conference 
discussed the issues on the agenda. The issues are as follows: 
  1. The statute of the Union of Palestinian Contractors 
  2. Directives on categorization of contractors 
  3. Public tender system and related directives 
  4. General conditions for civil works contracts and a 
unified contract between the owner and the contractor 
  After extensive discussions of the articles of the draft 
rules, regulations and directives, the conference endorsed them 
and recommended their submission to the head and members of the 
National Authority Council for approval. 
  The consitutent conference approved the merger of all 
previous unions and private associations of contractors in the 
new union, which will represent all Palestinian contractors 
inside and outside the homeland, and urged them all to join. 
  The conference announced the formation of the Union of 
Palestinian Contractors on 1 June 1994, with Jerusalem, the 
capital of the state of Palestine, as its main headquarters. 
The union will have branches in a number of Palestinian towns 
in accordance with the council's decision. 
  The union's council is composed of 15 members: Dawud al-Zir 
as president of the union; Muhamad Hijazi and Bashir Dallul as 
vice presidents; Khalid Abu 'Isha, Mu'ayad Rif'at al-Madi, 
Hashim Abu Sha'ban, 'Umar Abu al-'Arayis, Walid al-Ahmad, Safwat 
Mushtaha, Samih al-Tubaylah, Wa'il Abu Laylah, Lutfi Rizq, Mahir 
al-Tawil, Riyad al-Sha'ir, and George Rizq as members. The 
following have been appointed as advisers to the council: 
  Yusuf al-Hayik, Salman Abu Sittah, Khalil al-Sarraf, 'Umar 
Muhana, and 'Adil Zahran. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] President Yasir 'Arafat [Abu-'Ammar] today sent 
a cable of support to the participants in the conference of the 
International Union of Journalists [IUJ] convened since 
yesterday at the National Hotel in occupied Jerusalem. [passage 
omitted] 
  Brother President Abu-'Ammar said that the press has never 
played such an important role in an international issue such as 
the role it has played in the Palestinian cause and the Middle 
East crisis over the last three decades. This was due to the 
region's sensitivity and importance compared with other parts of 
the world and the peoples of the world, a factor that explains 
the need to deal with the peace process in objectivity and 
justice, so as to reach a just solution guaranteeing our 
people's inalienable rights, freedom and independence. 
  President 'Arafat called on the conferees to support the 
peace process and our people's efforts to build their national 
institutions, economic structure and infrastructure so that they 
can feel and enjoy the fruits of peace and look forward to a 
promising future in which stability, security and cooperation 
prevails between all the countries and peoples of the Middle 
East. 
  'Arafat stressed that the Palestinian National Authority, 
which was formed a few days ago to manage our people's affairs 
until free and open general elections are held, is committed to 
its obligations regarding peace and the freedom of the 
individual, the freedom of thought, the freedom of work and the 
freedom of the press for the sake of a real interaction in the 
open Palestinian society. [passage omitted] 
  It is worth mentioning that this conference, the first of 
its 
kind to be held in Jerusalem, will be held over three days at 
the invitation of the League of Arab Journalists and the 
International Journalists' Union to discuss the challenges 
facing Palestinian journalists. A number of journalists are 
unable to attend because of the closure of Jerusalem. 
Journalists also suffer from imprisonment, beatings and bans as 
occupation authorities still think with a mentality of 
occupation and not one of neighborliness; the proof is the 
closure of Jericho and Gaza and Jerusalem, brother Sai'd 
'Uraykat said. Furthermore there are the increasing practices 
of the settlers and the army against our people.

<F P=106> [By Muhammad Salamah] </F>
  [Text] Shaykh As'ad Bayyud al-Tamimi, leader of the Islamic 
Jihad Movement-Bayt al-Maqdis, has said that he has turned down 
an offer by President Yasir 'Arafat to accompany him to Jericho, 
viewing such a trip as accepting Israel's domination. 
  Asked by AKHIR KHABAR if he was offered a part in the 
Palestinian National Authority, Shaykh al-Tamimi said that 
President Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] had contacted several 
Palestinian figures, including his son, Nadir al-Tamimi, 
offering them the portfolio of the Religious Affairs Ministry. 
Nadir, he said, is now in Tunis. 
  Shaykh al-Tamimi added: This is a personal contact rather 
than coordination between the Palestinian leadership and the 
Islamic Jihad Movement-Bayt al-Maqdis. 
  Asked whether Dr. Nadir has agreed to participate in the 
Palestinian Authority, Shaykh al-Tamimi said: Although this is 
a personal affair, I oppose it because such participation in 
principle means bargaining. Therefore, I urge Nadir to reject 
it. 
  He added: If the self-rule area is expanded to include the 
whole West Bank, I will agree to enter these territories to 
establish an Islamic opposition party, but not to participate in 
the Palestinian Authority.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Al-Shaqaqi: Arrest of `Jihad' </F>
Members Will Redouble Its Operations Against the Occupation"] 
  [Text] Damascus, AL-HAYAH -- Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, 
secretary general of the "Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine," 
has stated that he held "indirect contacts" with Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat and the PLO leadership for the release 
of Jihad member Hani 'Abid who had been detained by the 
Palestinian police. He emphasized that the participation of the 
other Palestinian forces in the autonomy elections was "a good 
reason for us not to participate in them." 
  In an interview with AL-HAYAH, al-Shaqaqi said that the 
military operations carried out by the "Islamic Mujahidin 
Forces" (QSM) [al-quwa al-islamiyah al-mujahidah] attached to 
the Movement "demonstrated that the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza 
was not real, that Israeli sovereignty is still there, and that 
the authority in the Palestinian administration is Israel." 
  He said that, in his view, "the Palestinian security forces 
abducted Hani 'Abid to use him as a political hostage to make us 
stop our jihad operations." He added that he told the PLO 
leadership and President 'Arafat "indirectly that the arrest of 
our brothers would escalate military action against the 
occupation to prove to them (the PLO leadership) that they 
cannot blackmail us by detaining one of our brothers in the 
Movement." He also said that as long as long as 'Abid remains 
in detention "we will escalate military action, and (his 
continued detention) will not be a reason to stop (military 
action) as they hope. We will redouble our operations against 
the occupation until they convince us that the occupation has 
come to an end and that there is no Israeli presence in Gaza." 
  Asked why they have not been killing Palestinian "agents" or 
"collaborators" as the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) has 
been doing, al-Shaqaqi said: "We are extremely careful 
regarding the question of collaborators. The cases where the 
Jihad Movement killed collaborators were clear and flagrantly 
self-confessed. We do not act on mere suspicion or personal 
interrogation." He ruled out the possibility of the Jihad 
Movement killing "collaborators because the Palestinian police 
force is there and that matter is ultimately left to it." 
  After he reaffirmed his "absolute refusal to participate in 
the autonomy elections," AL-HAYAH remarked that other parties 
have contacted 'Arafat and are willing to do so. He replied: 
"That is a very good reason for us not to participate. Some, 
even a small minority, should uphold what is right, say no to 
this game loud and clear, and be the people's conscience."

  [Text] The Shin Bet several days ago uncovered an 
assassination attempt against Jibril al-Rujub, head of the 
Palestinian preventive security service. Al-Rujub, who was in 
Tulkarm that day, was informed he had better cancel a planned 
visit to Nabulus because he can expect an unpleasant surprise 
there. 
  The tension between the Palestinian police and Hamas 
[Islamic 
Resistance Movement] in the Gaza and Jericho autonomy areas is 
increasing.

  [Text] Meetings of the tripartite Jordanian-U.S.-Israeli 
economic committee were concluded in Washington yesterday 
evening. Addressing media and press correspondents on the 
results of these meetings, Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of 
state for cabinet affairs and information minister, said: 
  [Begin recording] First, one of the most important results 
is 
that the Jordanian and Israeli sides were able -- through the 
meetings held in connection with the meeting of the tripartite 
economic committee -- to reach a detailed agenda on the issue of 
the Jordanian territory. 
  Within this framework, it has been agreed to form a 
committee 
whose task is to come to the region to demarcate the Jordanian 
borders in accordance with what was agreed in the joint agenda 
signed last September. Thus, we have reiterated a basic 
principle; namely, Jordanian borders will turn from cease-fire 
borders to internationally-recognized borders. This affirms 
Jordan's territorial integrity, thereby ending any ambitions 
toward these territories and safeguarding the Jordanian entity. 
  We, of course, agreed on two basic principles: The first 
principle is that we should return to the [British] mandate 
agreement on border demarcation; and second, these borders must 
be demarcated on the ground. 
  The second important dimension reached is related to water. 
We know that the issue of water is a very sensitive issue for 
Jordan. It is also directly linked with the rights of Jordanian 
sovereignty. Israel used to take from the Jordanian waters in 
the Jordan and al-Yarmuk Rivers; that is, it takes more than its 
share agreed on in the international and regional agreements 
organizing this relationship. Therefore, another committee will 
be formed to fairly redistribute water in harmony with Jordan's 
rights in this regard. 
  Also, it has been agreed that the Jordan Valley project 
will be viewed as a full-blown project, according to which there 
will be discussions for developing its infrastructure. Big 
projects that will be discussed later will be launched there in 
the future. That is, we have endorsed the launching of some 
studies that will pave the way for the launching of big 
development projects in the Jordan Valley. You may recall, in 
particular, that the most important project in this regard is 
the desalination project, or the project of extending a canal 
linking the Red Sea to the Dead Sea. This project is a Jordanian 
plan and proposal in the first place, and came in response to 
Israeli plans to build a canal linking the Mediterranean to the 
Dead Sea. 
  Regarding the talks held within the context of the 
tripartite 
committee, it has been agreed that the U.S. side will prepare a 
paper on the Jordan Valley, and the projects planned to be 
carried out there. However, this effort will be confined to the 
realm of studies at present. This is because the implementation 
of such projects is unthinkable before an agreement is reached 
on the issue of borders. 
  With respect to economic issues, particularly in light of 
the 
agreement signed between the PLO and the Israeli side on the 
issue of banking and trade, the Jordanian side explained the 
impact of this agreement on the Jordanian economy. This is 
because this agreement somewhat restricts the freedom to export 
Jordanian commodities to the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The 
Israeli side agreed that it is possible to expand the prospects 
for Jordanian exports to the Palestinian territories. 
  Additionally, it has been agreed that Jordan will be 
informed 
of any future plans or proposals, let us say, to issue a 
Palestinian currency so that Jordan may adopt measures that 
could protect its currency. Jordan will be given sufficient 
time to take such measures. 
  According to the agenda signed, it transpired that some 
issues can be discussed at the trilateral level. That is why a 
Jordanian-Palestinian-Israeli economic committee was called on 
to meet to discuss some issues at the trilateral level, to 
discuss them and resolve them appropriately. 
  In a nutshell, these are the most important results reached. 
In my view, these results are very important for Jordan. This 
is because they protect and contribute to safeguarding Jordan's 
identity, demographic makeup, and territorial integrity. [end

<F P=106> [Report by Randah Habib from Amman] </F>
  [Text] Next month Washington will launch a working plan to 
carry out economic projects between Jordan and Israel after 
these two countries have surmounted the most important obstacle 
to the progress of their bilateral negotiations, by forming a 
committee in Washington yesterday to demarcate joint borders. 
The committee will rotate meetings in Jordan and Israel 
starting in July. 
  The U.S. plan is based on two studies; the first is 
Jordanian 
and the other Israeli, which were presented in Washington. 
Washington will deduce the joint points included in the two 
studies to formulate a plan that is acceptable to both sides in 
order to be discussed by the tripartite committee in Washington 
next month. 
  The Jordanian file includes, in particular, the two seas 
canal plan, to link the Red Sea with the Dead Sea, while the 
Israeli plan speaks about linking the Mediterranean with the 
Dead Sea. 
  This Jordanian plan enjoys Washington's support, which 
considers it more realistic and useful, and closer to 
implementation. 
  Moreover, Amman no longer opposes the holding of the 
international economic conference on its territory. It will be 
held here next year, after a preparatory conference has been 
held in Morocco in November. 
  These developments come at a time when Prime Minister 
'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali is preparing to reshuffle his cabinet 
today in which he will introduce approximately 10 deputies. 
This will allow the participation of the legislative council in 
the decisions of the executive branch at a time when Jordan has 
expressed its readiness to sign a border agreement with Israel 
without waiting for the conclusion of a peace treaty.

  [Text] Jeddah, June 6, SPA -- The Minister of Finance and 
National Economy, Muhammad Aba-al-Khayl, who is also the 
representative of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the IDB's 
[Islamic Development Bank] board of governors, opened on Monday 
[6 June] a symposium on the fringes of the 151st meeting of the 
bank's executive managers. 
  Addressing the opening ceremony, Aba-al-Khayl, on behalf of 
the Saudi Government, welcomed the participants and emphasized 
the steadfast determination of the government of Custodian of 
the Two Holy Mosques, King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz to support all 
Islamic joint action projects. 
  "The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which is honoured by the 
Almighty Allah to house the two holy harams, has been sparing no 
effort to reinforce the Islamic solidarity, cooperation and 
cohesion between all Moslems of the world with noble and welfare 
initiatives which led to the creation of a number of Islamic 
organizations," he said. 
  "Moreover, the role of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is not 
merely confined to the establishment of the existing Islamic 
organizations, but is also continuing to extend the unlimited 
moral and material support to these organizations which are 
located in the kingdom or elsewhere," Aba-al-Khayl said. 
  He affirmed that the kingdom will continue to extend 
whatever 
necessary support is required for the activities of the IDB 
(Islamic Development Bank) which was set up to dedicate 
cooperation between Islamic states. 
  The finance and national economy minister expressed deep 
satisfaction over the excellent performance of the IDB as a 
leading Islamic economic institution and expressed confidence 
that the bank would realise aspirations of member states. 
  Aba-al-Khayl said the paid capital of the IDB has increased 
to dlrs 8.4 billion from two billion dollars and the number of 
its member states now totals 47 with the joining of a number of 
Central Asian states. 
  He cited the necessity of maintaining the firm financial 
performance of the IDB. 
  Addressing the gathering, Dr. Osama Faqih, president of the 
IDB welcomed the participants and spotlighted the great 
achievements accomplished by the IDB in the framework of the 
noble objectives for which it was established. 
  Praising the distinguished financing policies being pursued 
by the IDB, Faqih expressed delight that the bank had managed to 
develop successful financing policies that suit the Islamic laws 
in all banking dealings. 
  For this purpose, he said, the Islamic Institute for 
Research 
and Training was set up in 1993 to make adaptation of modern 
financing techniques. 
  He said the bank is giving priority for financing 
commodities 
and products of Islamic origin and expressed confidence that the 
bank will continue to develop its methods to extend services for 
the entire Islamic world.

  [Text] Occupied Jerusalem, QUDS PRESS -- A Palestinian 
National Authority [PNA] official has said the PNA has decided 
to form a Palestinian shadow government in east Jerusalem to 
face the recent Israeli measures. 
  The PNA minister, who asked not to be named, asserted that 
"there will be no official announcement of the government" that 
will run Palestinian economic and social activities in Jerusalem. 
  According to the Palestinian source, the PNA "has stopped 
short of announcing the formation of the shadow government and 
announcing officially the creation of a special ministry for 
Jerusalem affairs in order not to embarrass the Israeli 
government or weaken its domestic political position." However, 
the recent Israeli statements on the future of Palestinian 
institutions in Jerusalem and the moves under way to pass 
legislation against these institutions "could prompt the 
Palestinian leadership to adopt steps to escalate the situation 
and prevent the Israeli government from changing the status quo 
of the city to weaken the Palestinian negotiating stance" before 
starting the final negotiations that will determine the fate of 
the city, as the Palestinian minister put it. 
  The Palestinian official told QUDS PRESS the shadow 
government, which could be headed by Palestinian leader Yasir 
'Arafat, will comprise several ministries, including "social 
affairs, housing, tourism and antiquities, education, sports and 
youth, health, and awqaf" in addition to any other ministries 
the PNA thinks are necessary to consolidate the Palestinian 
presence in the city. The official added that "the activities 
of these ministries will not be carried out in public unless the 
Israeli authorities adopt measures against Palestinian 
institutions in east Jerusalem." 
  The Palestinian official further said the government's 
activities include renovating houses and supporting other 
activities that contribute to intensifying the Palestinian 
presence "to bolster the negotiating position" of the PNA. The 
official asserted that the PNA has decided to hold consultations 
with the Palestinian opposition forces in order to coordinate 
action to preserve the city of Jerusalem. The Palestinian 
minister added that "political views could be different but we 
are agreed on the need to maintain the Arab presence in 
Jerusalem." The source did not reveal when the consultations 
will begin which, he said, "might not be publicized in the 
beginning, taking into consideration the political position of 
the Palestinian forces."

  [Text] Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi asserted today that Israel has 
been grossly violating the agreement with the PLO and curtailing 
the freedom of action of the Palestinian institutions in East 
Jerusalem. This gross violation creates facts on the ground 
prior to the discussions about the permanent arrangement, 
'Ashrawi said. In a news conference she called today, Hanan 
'Ashrawi declared that the Independent Palestinian Committee for 
Civil Rights headed by her will be the comptroller of the 
autonomy and the Palestinian state. 'Ashrawi will fill this role 
after she received the approval of Yasir 'Arafat and the 
Palestine National Council. Our correspondent Avi Lifshitz 
reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Lifshitz] Following the media and 
parliamentary uproar in Israel over Shim'on Peres' letter on the 
issue of Jerusalem, it is interesting to see how things look 
from the other side. 'Ashrawi, a Palestinian leader in the 
territories and the former spokesperson of the negotiating team 
with Israel, believes that the measures taken by Rabin to 
curtail the activities of the Palestinian institutions in East 
Jerusalem constitute a violation of the agreement with the PLO. 
  ['Ashrawi, in English] I think that Israel is violating the 
agreement by trying to deal unilaterally with postponed issues. 
I think these are illegal. By law, Jerusalem, East Jerusalem, 
is part of the occupied territories. No amount of unilateral 
annexation, or manipulation, or distortion of the law by Israel 
is going to change that fact. 
  [Lifshitz translates the above and continues] It further 
came out in the news conference that 'Ashrawi will be the Myriam 
Ben-Porat of the Palestinian autonomy. She presented the 
Independent Palestinian Committee for Civil Rights which will be 
the comptroller of the newly-established Palestinian Authority 
and, according to her, also of the future Palestinian state. 
This, with the approval of 'Arafat and the endorsement of the 
PLO institutions and the Palestinian Authority. This committee 
will not confine its work only to the boundaries of the 
autonomy, she said. 
  ['Ashrawi, in English] We are not restricted to one phase, 
like Gaza-Jericho, or one geographic location. We will deal 
with Palestinian issues throughout the Palestinian territories. 
  [Lifshitz translates the above and continues] We will 
operate everywhere, including Judaea and Samaria, 'Ashrawi said. 
The new body has the right to investigate irregularities, 
access information, and monitor processes in the making. 
Already, it has approached senior PLO officials and managed to 
solve the problem of the property of absentees in Jericho. 
  By heading the audit committee -- which, incidentally, will 
reside in East Jerusalem -- 'Ashrawi is probably saying that she 
has disqualified herself from being a member of any executive 
council of the autonomy. [end recording]

  [Text] Amman, AL-DUSTUR -- Nabil 'Amr, political adviser 
to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, will leave Amman today 
for the occupied Palestinian territories on his first visit 
since 1967. 
  'Amr said he will visit his relatives and hold contacts and 
consultations with Palestinian political forces and nationalist 
figures in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to pursue efforts made 
last year to set up a Palestinian democratic grouping. 
  'Amr said this grouping is a developed formula of the 
initiative proposed by 116 Palestinian personalities from inside 
and outside the territories in a memorandum that called for 
enhancing democracy in the Palestinian arena inside and outside 
the territories. 
  'Amr added that this initiative does not conflict with the 
fact that he is a member of Fatah or with his official duties in 
the PLO. 
  'Amr worked as director general of Palestinian radios for 10 
years, and then as a media adviser to the Palestinian president, 
and ambassador to the Soviet Union for five years.

  [Excerpt] A few hours ago, terrorists opened fire at the 
hothouses of Kfar Darom in the Gaza Strip, but nobody was hurt. 
An IDF [Israel Defense Forces] unit arrived on the scene and 
opened fire at the terrorists, who fled in two Peugeot 404's. 
  Last night, the IDF set out in hot pursuit of a Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement] terrorist squad into the area of 
the autonomy. The three terrorists who opened fire at an IDF 
patrol fled in the direction of Rafah. Our forces did not 
sustain any casualties. During the pursuit, hundreds of local 
inhabitants gathered and threw stones at the soldiers in a bid 
to prevent them from catching the perpetrators. According to 
Palestinian sources, five local Palestinians were injured by IDF 
gunfire during this pursuit. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Gaza, from Mustafa al-Sawwaf, AL-NAHAR Documentation 
and Press Office -- Dr. Ibrahim al-Yazuri, one of the leaders of 
Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] in the Gaza Strip, has 
stressed the need for postponing talks on forming a political 
party until things settle down and we can see how democratic the 
self-rule authority will be. 
  He said that the notion of forming an Islamic political 
party 
is good for presenting concepts from an Islamic perspective 
under the National Authority. But, he added, there are 
drawbacks, such as the need to obtain a permit from the 
Authority to set up such a party. This Authority has not been 
elected or established by the masses. 
  Al-Yazuri continued by saying that he is inclined to form an 
opposition front that includes all factions opposed to the 
agreement because this front, unlike a party, would not need a 
permit from the Authority. According to al-Yazuri, the 
Authority established by the agreements signed in Oslo and Cairo 
has conceded many Palestinian rights and there is nothing 
positive about it other than the return of the Palestinian 
police and deportees. 
  Al-Yazuri denied recent statements made by Major General 
Nasr 
Yusuf [commander of the Palestinian police] that the latter has 
contacted or met with Dr. al-Yazuri to discuss last week's 
incidents of kidnapping and killing agents. He stressed that he 
has no knowledge of such meetings or contacts, adding that this 
claim is baseless.

  [Text] Damascus, Ramallah, from Rashid Hilal -- Dr. George 
Habash, secretary general of the Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], has stated that, despite its 
refusal to participate in the self-rule authority's security and 
executive establishments, the PFLP will remain among the masses 
and keep its establishments because it is part of the social 
fabric of Palestinian society and its social structure. He said 
that the PFLP will not take a negative stand toward the 
establishments that serve the citizens but will seek to improve 
them and develop their social and national acts and performance 
in a way that serves our policies and views while extending the 
necessary services to the citizens. 
  In an exclusive statement to AL-QUDS, Dr. Habash said that 
the way the Palestinian forces who reject the agreement will 
confront the Palestinian self-rule authority will not go outside 
the pragmatic forms which are now known to everyone -- 
political, and media struggle. He added: These forms will 
remain valid and suitable even after the implementation of the 
agreement. Any change in these forms will remain within this 
framework and we will not deviate from it as a rule, unless the 
Palestinian authority resorts to violence against the masses and 
forces that reject the agreement. He stressed that he will not 
be the first to resort to violence. 
  Habash noted that the loopholes in the agreement and its 
inherent contradictions are not enough to bring it down, but 
action is needed to turn the slogan of foiling the agreement 
into a practical one. He said that the forces rejecting the 
agreement are determined to formalize their opposition through 
effective and influential popular, mass, and political actions. 
  Habash stressed that these forces will seriously work to 
complete the widely based national and Islamic front and rebuild 
the PLO on national, democratic, and struggle bases in 
accordance with the national program and charter so as to allow 
as much participation as possible by most sectors of our people 
inside and outside the territories.

<F P=106> [Report from Jerusalem] </F>
  [Text] A report by the Palestinian Information Center on 
Human Rights, affiliated with the Arab Studies Association, 
yesterday published statistics on the planning policy and the 
demolition of Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem, as part of 
the extensive popular plan the center is launching against the 
demolition policy pursued by the Jerusalem Municipality. 
  The report estimates the number of Palestinian families who 
lack proper housing in East Jerusalem and who have been forced 
to live in shelters and tents, or in homes occupied by one or 
two other families, at 21,000. 
  According to the report, this is the direct result of the 
authority's policy of demolishing homes and expropriating lands 
and its discriminatory housing policy that restrict landowners' 
use of their lands. 
  The center provided documented facts revealing that over 210 
Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem have been demolished by the 
Israeli authorities for reasons related to construction licenses 
since 1986. 
  The report revealed that 50 Palestinian homes are being 
demolished in East Jerusalem every year. Of the total area of 
the city of East Jerusalem, which is 73,000 donums, 29,000 
donums have been, or are waiting to be, expropriated soon to 
build Jewish settlements. Palestinians are allowed to build on 
10,000 donums, while 35,000 donums are being left without 
planning, the report says. 
  According to the report, Palestinians have been licensed to 
build on 14 percent of East Jerusalem lands, on which 
Palestinians have already built homes. Buildings in Palestinian 
neighborhoods cannot exceed two stories, while those in Jewish 
suburbs rise as high as eight stories. 
  The report notes that Palestinian citizens in Jerusalem pay 
26 percent of the cost of services provided by the municipality, 
although they received only 5 percent of these services. The 
property taxes ranged from 14 to 39.2 new shekels per square 
meter in 1994. 
  Illustrating the policy of discrimination against citizens, 
the report pointed out that the Israeli Government provided 
subsidized homes for 70,000 Jewish families in the settlements 
of East Jerusalem alone, against 555 for Palestinian families. 
The structural plan for Jerusalem reserves over half the area 
of East Jerusalem for Jewish settlements and institutions. 
  The report cites a sampling study by Dr. Bernard Sabila 
[name 
as transliterated], political science lecturer at Bethlehem 
University, that provided the following estimates of 
Palestinians who emigrated with their families since 1967: 
  - 16,917 have emigrated to other countries since 1967; 
  - 12,080 moved outside the limits of the municipality; 
  - 12,500 reside in north Jerusalem; and 
  - 7,630 were abroad prior to 1967 and accordingly never 
obtained Jerusalem identity cards.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Ahmad 'Ubaydat] </F>
  [Text] The Israeli-Palestinian Civil Committee is set to 
reconvene within two weeks to work out arrangements for the 
early empowerment of the rest of the civil departments in the 
West Bank. This was disclosed by Jamil al-Tarifi, coordinator 
general of the Palestinian civil authorities. I asked him about 
an Israeli proposal that a number of Palestinian prisoners be 
freed with the proviso that they are confined to the Gaza Strip 
until they serve out their terms, attorney al-Tarifi said: 
  [Begin recording] [Al-Tarifi] When it became clear that 
this was the intention of the Israeli Government, I was 
instructed late last night by President 'Arafat to reject the 
decision. The Cairo agreement calls for the release of 5,000 
detainees, with the release of the rest to be negotiated later. 
There is nothing in the Cairo agreement to suggest that, once 
freed, the detainees should be confined to Gaza or Jericho, 
except in unusual cases; both the Israelis and we know what 
these are. The restrictive clause does not apply to all of the 
detainees. 'Arafat has instructed all agencies of the 
Palestinian authority in the occupied territory to reject the 
Israeli proposal. Major General 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya, who 
arrived from Amman yesterday, has been named as head of the 
Palestinian side to the joint Security Committee. He will 
address the issue at the negotiating table, God willing. 
  ['Ubaydat] I asked attorney al-Tarifi whether a particular 
supplier has been contracted to feed Gaza with electricity? 
  [Al-Tarifi] A ship owned by a Canadian-Norwegian company is 
to dock at Gaza and feed the Strip with 100 megawatts. In the 
interim, our electricity needs will continue to be filled by the 
Israeli National Electricity Grid. 
  ['Ubaydat] I asked al-Tarifi about the lack of stamps and 
postal orders and exit permits in the Post Office in the Jericho 
region. 
  [Al-Tarifi] Palestinian postage stamps are under production.

<F P=106> [Article by Bashir al-Barghuti: "To Prevent Differences </F>
From Taking a Turn for the Worse"] 
  [Text] Difficulties and restrictions imposed by the Cairo 
agreement itself have started to emerge from the moment it was 
implemented. The Israeli side has thwarted the attempts to 
contain or bypass them. Not a single day passes without Israeli 
measures that aim to remind the Palestinian side of the 
limitations of its role and of its responsibility toward what 
Israel regards as its security interest. 
  It would be an extreme simplification to suppose that all 
the 
problems could be solved in closed rooms without this resulting 
in measures in Gaza and Jericho that would affect the 
Palestinian citizen and limit his freedom and his ability to 
pursue his ambitions toward his national objectives. 
  I do not think that anyone in our country or our citizens 
abroad considers the Cairo agreement to be a fulfillment of 
their national objectives or their liberation from the yoke of 
occupation. The occupation laws remain, and changing or 
annulling them depends on the Israeli side's approval. The 
streets of Gaza and Jericho are open for the armed settlers as 
well as for the Israeli army. None of the clauses of the 
"Gaza-Jericho First" agreement contain any reference to the 
possibility of developing it outside the context of the concepts 
of the Israeli Labor Party's program, specifically to the 
concepts of the Jordan River as Israel's security border, of 
withdrawal from the populated areas, and of keeping the 
settlements, or the majority of them. 
  Therefore, it would be naive to suppose that the 
antioccupation activities will stop because the Cairo agreement 
has been signed or because the Palestinian police have started 
to patrol the streets of Jericho and the Strip. 
  While acknowledging that no one wants internal fighting or 
the fabrication of problems with the Palestinian police, we 
should not forget the presence of the Israeli side and the 
duties imposed by the Cairo agreement on the Palestinian side 
toward the antioccupation activities. These might, 
unintentionally, lead to friction and tension. We started to 
feel some of its aspects in the past few days, such as the 
firing on the Jewish synagogue in Jericho, the arrest of armed 
agents in the area, and the Palestinian side's compulsion to 
hand them over to the Israeli police after showing Israeli 
identity cards. Similar incidents took place in Gaza, such as 
the killing of two persons accused of being Israeli agents. 
  We hope that these incidents will remain very limited and 
that they will be dealt with patiently and wisely. But the 
nature of the exceptional situation in which the Cairo agreement 
has placed us makes it a situation fraught with unhappy and 
possibly grave expectations. 
  Hence, matters should not be left to chance. The literal 
implementation of the Cairo agreement in an area where armed men 
from the Israeli army and settlers move alongside the 
Palestinian police and other Palestinian parties will increase 
the dangers of friction. Throwing just one stone might create a 
major problem. Such problems could also arise in cases where a 
Palestinian citizen commits a security violation outside the 
Palestinian police's jurisdiction, in which case the latter 
would be required to arrest and hand him over to the Israeli 
police. 
  Should such cases happen -- and we hope they will not -- 
they 
will then be a source of tension, more doubts, and unease. The 
important thing is that this should not develop into friction 
between Palestinian citizens and that the differences should 
remain political and expressed democratically and in a civilized 
manner. This necessitates the presence of a Palestinian body 
that includes supporters and opponents or members acceptable to 
these two sides. It should comprise independent Palestinian 
figures with political and social weight who are respected by 
all. The body would constitute "a panel of jurors" that will 
rule on differences between the national forces and prevent 
these differences from developing into some sort of fighting 
that will only benefit the enemies of our people. 
  It is a great mistake to suppose that administrative tools 
alone are enough to resolve all possible serious problems. The 
presence of a "panel of jurors" will not harm the Palestinian 
authority, especially as it has already accepted a 
Palestinian-Israeli civilian committee for cooperation and 
coordination that monitors the activities of its departments and 
the extent of their adherence to the agreement. Since this is 
the case, why should there not be "a panel of jurors" from 
outside the Palestinian authority that can monitor the extent of 
this authority's adherence to the conditions of national unity 
and the Palestine National Council's resolutions, for the sole 
purpose of preventing differences from assuming grave dimensions

  [Text] Kuwait, 4 Jun -- The United Kingdom's ambassador to 
Kuwait stressed that British-Kuwaiti relations were deep and 
solid, and expressed his country's keenness to increase and 
develop these relations in various fields, particularly trade 
and defense. 
  In a statement to AL-QABAS newspaper, published here today, 
Ambassador William [Hugh] Fullerton said Britain "puts great 
importance on its relations with the State of Kuwait and these 
relations have been characterized by consistency and strength." 
  He added that on the political, trade, and defense level, 
the 
relations between the State of Kuwait and Britain were 
"progressing continuously as has been illustrated by the mutual 
visits of senior officials from the two countries and the visits 
of the British naval units to Kuwaiti ports and the royal 
airforce. For instance, seven trade missions visited Kuwait 
during the last few months at the end of which trade agreements 
were concluded. 
  William Fullerton stressed the need "to continue the 
imposition of economic sanctions on the Iraqi regime in order to 
comply with the UN resolutions, on top of which is the 
recognition of Kuwait and its sovereignty and the release of the 
captives detained by the Iraqi regime." 
  The ambassador made clear that "Kuwait enjoys a democracy 
with special vitality where Diwaniyahs [guest houses] exist 
alongside the National Assembly and there is an interest in 
human rights issue in Kuwait." 
  William Fullerton stated "Britain is keen to have balanced 
relations with all the region's countries and believes that 
stability in the region does not come by waging wars."

  [Text] London, June 7, IRNA -- Former Saudi Arabian 
diplomat, Muhammad 'Abdallah al-Khalawi says he is adding his 
voice to a growing number of moderate, educated Saudi 
intellectuals, who can no longer tolerate the abuses of power by 
the present regime in Riyadh. 
  This voice, he declares, will not be stilled by bribery or 
character assassination, nor stifled by threats, from stating 
its legitimate demands to ensure that political freedom and best 
interests of the peace-loving people of Saudi Arabia are 
recognized. 
  Al-Khalawi defected from being the first secretary at the 
Saudi mission to the United Nations in New York after writing a 
letter to heir apparent [Crown Prince] 'Abdallah last month 
stipulating his "sincere opposition" to the Riyadh government. 
He laid out that he opposed policies based upon family 
favoritism, corruption and the purposeful incitement of hatred 
among various social and sectarian groups, which he said, were 
to divide and weaken the social fabric of the Saudi people. In 
addition, he spoke against steps taken taken by the regime in 
the international arena that involved itself in "wars and 
enmities with Muslim countries, both Arab and non-Arab" and 
entering into nuclear arrangements without necessary legal 
guarantees. 
  The former Saudi diplomat has since sought political asylum 
in the United States and made known his views to the Committee 
for the Defense of Legitimate Rights in Saudi Arabia (CDLR), 
which moved its office to London in April this year. 
  His defection is the first from a senior political figure 
and 
is seen as a coup for the committee, set up last year by a group 
of Saudi academics calling for moderate reforms to the 
autocratic rule of the royal family. In a letter to the CDLR, 
al-Khalawi suggested that he had been subjected to a kidnap 
attempt and a visit from Saudi intelligence since writing the 
letter. He said that he was first made an offer to buy his 
silence before threats were made to his life and those of his 
close family both in New York and in Saudi Arabia. The governor 
of Riyadh, Prince Salman, is also understood to have asked his 
relatives to bring him back from the U.S. or failing this, to 
stay in exile themselves. 
  The former diplomat said he also has proof of the severe 
violations of human rights that have been going on in Saudi 
Arabia from almost 14,000 secret documents he collected while 
being first secretary at the United Nations for the past four 
years. His letter to the heir apparent set forth demands for 
the elimination of such wrongdoings, which he said he could no 
longer tolerate.

  [Text] Riyadh, 8 Jun (SPA) -- The Saudi press tackled in 
their editorials a number of regional and international issues. 
  Concerning the situation in Yemen the daily `AL-YAWM' 
stresses that what is happening in sisterly Yemen, the 
continuation of the conflict between the north and the south, 
saddens every Arab Muslim. 
  Despite Yemen's announcement that it will positively respond 
to Arab, Islamic, and international appeals for a cease-fire, 
the paper goes on to say, the war is still raging between the 
north and the south [of Yemen] and human and material losses on 
both sides are mounting. 
  The ideal, logical, and only solution to the Yemeni 
conflict, 
the paper adds, is to stop the gun fire, to place the supreme 
Yemeni interests over personal interests, and to listen to 
reason in order to save what can be saved of human and material 
resources in Yemen. 
  For its part, the daily `Al-MADINAH' notes that battles 
taking place in Yemen in the name of unity does not harm only 
the perpetrator, it also harms the whole world's view of Arabs. 
  The paper says: While the world is seeing a trend toward 
integration through dialogue and the ballot box, the Yemenis are 
resorting to the sword instead of dialogue and to murder instead 
of the ballot box. 
  The paper goes on to say: Many Yemeni people, on both sides, 
have fallen victim in the name of unity. Large economic 
installations have been destroyed in the name of prosperity that 
will come with unity and hundreds of thousands of Yemenis have 
been made homeless in the name of reuniting them. What kind of 
logic governs what is happening and what should the people 
believe? Is it what they hear about the noble objectives or the 
death, destruction, and displacement of people that they see? 
  The paper says that the demand for an immediate cease-fire 
stated in the GCC ministerial council's communique and its 
emphasis on the impossibility of achieving unity by force is a 
clear message to the warring brothers in Yemen.

  [Text] Sanaa, June 8 (AFP) -- UN special envoy Lakhdar 
Ibrahimi urged the warring sides in Yemen Wednesday [8 June] to 
stop fighting and start negotiating as battles raged outside the 
southern bastion of Aden. 
  Ibrahimi arrived from Cairo and was due to hold talks later 
with northern government officials, before meeting President 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih on Thursday. 
  "The in-fighting between brothers must stop and must stop 
now, and give way to resuming negotiations," Ibrahimi, a former 
Algerian foreign minister, said as he arrived on a fact-finding 
mission. 
  He has been sent under the terms of a UN Security Council 
resolution adopted last week calling on Salih's forces and those 
of his southern rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid to cease hostilities 
immediately. 
  A ceasefire announced Monday by northern leaders collapsed 
within hours, and the UN has reported that up to one million 
people could be in need of humanitarian aid following the month 
of fighting. 
  Salih warned Wednesday that the war would last longer 
because 
the international community had become involved in the conflict. 
  "Bilateral, direct discussions are the best way. Since it 
has become an international issue the conflict will take much 
longer." 
  And he added that international observers in Yemen would be 
"a flagrant interference in our internal affairs." 
  Meanwhile, 27 civilians, mainly women and children, were 
killed and 45 wounded in an attack on Dar Sa'd village 15 
kilometers (10 miles) north of Aden, officials at the 
al-Jumhuriyah hospital said. 
  The morgue in the southern city was reported to be 
overflowing, and head doctor Muhsin 'Awad told AFP "we have 20 
bodies outside the morgue." 
  Southern officials accused the north of shelling the village 
late Tuesday. 
  More shelling could be heard from Aden on Wednesday. 
  Correspondents reported that female militia forces from the 
south's Yemen Socialist Party were deployed Wednesday at 
roadblocks on routes leading into Aden to press gang men into 
fighting. 
  Ibrahimi told reporters on his arrival that he was starting 
his mission "with an open mind and a very strong desire to help 
the brothers in Yemen solve their problems."

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
Presidential Council chairman, today received brother Lakhdar 
Brahimi, personal envoy of UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali. During the meeting, the two sides discussed 
issues related to Lakhdar Ibrahimi's fact-finding mission in our 
country. 
  The president welcomed the UN secretary general's envoy. He 
reiterated our country's compliance with UN Security Council 
Resolution No. 924 on the situation in the Republic of Yemen, 
and its readiness to extend all possible support to guarantee 
the success of the mission of the UN secretary general's envoy. 
  The Presidential Council chairman also stressed that the 
forces of unity and legitimacy are fully abiding by the 
cease-fire, but the gang of rebellion and secession deliberately 
refuses to respond to and violates UN Security Council 
Resolution No. 924 in an attempt to internationalize the 
internal crisis in our country. He pointed out that the only 
thing that could prove the gang of rebellion and secession has 
responded to the resolution is for it to stop firing artillery 
shells at the positions of our Armed Forces at the entrances of 
the city of Aden, and pledge not to use what remains of the 
warplanes this secessionist gang has used to bombard the forces 
of unity and legitimacy along all axes. 
  The brother president said he has instructed our Armed 
Forces 
to observe a cease-fire as of 1800 [1500 GMT] today in 
implementation of UN Security Council Resolution No. 924, and to 
give a third chance to the rebellious and secessionist gang, 
hoping that this gang will not repeat its violations of the 
cease-fire, and will not continue its aggression against our 
Armed Forces. He emphasized that the forces of unity and 
legitimacy will fully and decisively comply with the cease-fire 
at all axes. 
  Brother Lakhdar Brahimi has expressed appreciation for the 
cooperation of the brother president and the officials in our 
country, for their care to make his mission a success, for 
complying with UN Security Council Resolution No. 924, and for 
doing all that will restore stability and security to Yemen. 
  Attending the meeting were Muhammad Salim Basindwah, 
minister 
of foreign affairs, and ambassador Muhammad Hadi, director of 
the Arab Department at the Foreign Ministry.

  [Text] Brother Muhammad 'Abdallah al-Batani, minister of 
social security and social affairs, met with UN Secretary 
General Butrus-Ghali in Geneva yesterday. He conveyed to him 
the greetings and gratitude of brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council. He 
explained in detail the situation in our country, particularly 
after the war criminal, traitor agent 'Ali Salim al-Bid, has 
fomented sedition among the sons of the Armed Forces in order to 
attain his treacherous conspiratorial aims. The brother 
minister told the UN secretary general that the secessionist 
gang does not represent the south or the Socialist Party, but 
only itself, and that it broke away from legitimacy and national 
unity. He said broad popular sectors as well as all leaders, 
members, and cadres of parties and sons of the Yemeni people do 
not agree with the secessionist clique's explosion of the 
situation or its treacherous secession announcement. He told 
him that unity took place peacefully and was blessed by the 
people and recognized by the Arabs and the world. He added that 
elections took place and a referendum on the constitution was 
held and that the claim that the unity was imposed by force is 
baseless. On the contrary, he said, there are attempts to 
impose secession by force by this deluded secessionist gang. He 
indicated that those who demand peace do not want or desire 
peace or even the existence of a strong and sound Yemen. 
  The UN secretary general expressed his desire to convey his 
greetings to the brother chairman of the Presidential Council. 
He said neither he nor the Security Council is biased toward 
any party, but there is right and wrong and there is no 
neutrality between the two. 
  Yahya Jaghman, our ambassador in Geneva, attended the 
meeting.

  [Text] The Council of Ministers held a regular meeting 
today under Acting Prime Minister brother Dr. Muhammad Sa'id 
al-'Attar. The Council listened to a report by Foreign Minister 
Muhammad Salim Basindwah on the latest political developments in 
Yemen and the preparations under way for receiving brother 
Lakhdar Ibrahimi, UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's 
envoy. 
  The Council also listened to a report presented by Interior 
Minister brother Brigadier General Yahya al-Mutawakkil on the 
stable security situation throughout the governorates of the 
republic, especially in the southern and eastern governorates. 
  The Council was briefed by brother Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman 
'Abd-al-Qadir Bafadal, minister of supply and trade, on the 
stable supply situation throughout the governorates of the 
republic. 
  The Council noted with great appreciation and pride the 
stands of our people in all governorates, especially in the 
southern and eastern governorates, and their support for the 
forces of the constitutional legitimacy and their unparalleled 
cooperation to defeat the secessionist scheme, which sought to 
fragment the country and harm a great historic achievement that 
the Yemeni masses looked forward to throughout the ages, 
represented by the reunification of the homeland on 22 May 1990. 
  The Council was briefed by the Defense Ministry on the 
military situation. In this regard, the Council praised the 
great efforts being exerted by the Armed Forces and security 
personnel to maintain our people's gains and national unity, 
consolidate security and stability, and thwart the intentions of 
those dreaming of harming Yemen's most sacred gain. 
  Meanwhile, the Council noted its extreme regret for certain 
states' statements, which reflect unprincipled stands on what is 
going on in our country. The Council hoped that these states 
will reconsider their stands in a manner that proves that they 
are really interested in preserving Yemeni blood and 
discouraging the secessionist rebels in order to safeguard 
Yemen's national, legitimate right to reinforce its unity and 
ensure its and its neighbors' security and stability. The 
Council reiterated that Yemeni unity is not only a national 
Yemeni gain, but also an Arab gain which had been wholeheartedly 
aspired to by all Arab masses.

brother Lakhdar Ibrahimi, envoy of the UN secretary general to 
our country on a fact-finding mission. The brother president 
underlined the commitment of our Armed Forces' -- the forces of 
unity and legitimacy -- to the letter and spirit of the UN 
Security Council resolution. He emphasized that this was 
despite the secessionist gang's breach of the cease-fire 
resolution and its refusal to be bound by it with the object of 
influencing world public opinion and calling in international 
forces to monitor the cease-fire. He said that we reject this 
in part and parcel. The ongoing war is not one between two 
countries or two systems of government; it is one between the 
Yemeni people and secessionist elements within the [Yemeni] 
Socialist Party [YSP] command. Yet, within the context of the 
new world order, we consented to the resolution and are prepared 
to deal with it, despite our deep conviction that the resolution 
amounts to blatant interference in our internal affairs. In this 
particular case, the Security Council undoubtedly curried favor 
with certain Arab regimes that sponsored the resolution, 
although permanent members of the council were not convinced of 
the resolution on the grounds that it constitutes meddling in 
our internal affairs. The consent of these states was only to 
please the resolution's sponsors. 
  The president emphasized that the military option has been 
forced on the homeland and the people by the rebellious 
secessionist gang. He said we are for dialogue, to which we 
committed ourselves as long ago as nine months when the crisis 
was stage managed by the secessionists who were paid for it, 
just as they were paid for the secession and the fratricidal 
fighting and the souls of the martyrs and the Yemeni blood that 
has been spilled. 
  The Yemeni state, the brother president added, will have a 
bright future and modern state institutions, with streamlined 
local government in order to cut back on centralization, and 
provincial administrations armed with sufficient powers, once 
the relevant amendments are introduced. 
  The brother president stated his interest in keeping up the 
dialogue with the unionists within the YSP. We are not prepared 
to talk with those who proclaimed secession and plotted against 
Yemeni unity and cashed in on the internecine fighting and 
secession. There can be no dialogue with these treasonous and 
criminal elements, now that they arrest warrants have been 
issued by the Republic's prosecutor general. 
  The remarks were made at a news conference the brother 
Presidential Council chairman held for local, Arab, and world 
news media. At the outset of the conference, he welcomed them 
and noted that this was the second such meeting with journalists 
since the traitor and war criminal al-Bid declared the invalid 
secession and formed the secessionist government. It also comes 
on the heels of the Security Council's resolution. The Yemeni 
Government said it will cooperate with all its clauses. 
  Regrettably, we had to make a decision, which we 
communicated 
to the UN secretary general, the Arab League secretary general, 
and the Islamic Conference Organization's secretary general, 
welcoming the resolution and declaring our intention to deal 
with its clauses. 
  Most regrettably, however, the treasonous secessionist 
elements refused to be bound by the resolution. The UN 
secretary general and international organizations have been 
informed of the breaches of which the secessionists are guilty. 
  Taking questions from journalists at the news conference, 
the brother chairman of the Presidential Council was asked what 
the forces of legitimacy were waiting for before they entered 
Aden, and if the delay is for military, political, or 
humanitarian reasons. Entering Aden is a political decision, he 
said, so as to avert as much material destruction as possible on 
humanitarian grounds, because the secessionist fighters are 
using citizens as human shields. If we do not send forces into 
Aden, this is out of our concern for the lives of civilians. 
  President Salih was asked about what measures could secure a 
cease-fire and whether he would sanction the presence of 
observers to monitor a cease-fire. We have informed the UN 
chief, the president said, that the secessionists have turned 
down the Security Council resolution and pursued their air 
attacks on the forces of legitimacy and the units positioned at 
the Aden Governorate's main approaches. We informed the UN 
secretary general that the separatists rejected the resolution 
despite their announcement that they were bound by it, which is 
not true. This is because the scenario of the command of 
apostasy and secession in the YSP calls for pursuing the 
hostilities to influence world public opinion under the pretext 
that the cease-fire is not holding, thus it may be possible to 
call in international forces to monitor the cease-fire. This we 
reject in part and parcel. We consented to the resolution, the 
president said, although we regard what is taking place in our 
country as an internal affair. The ongoing war is not one 
between two countries or two systems of government, but between 
the Yemeni people and secessionists within the YSP command. 
  Asked about the method of observing the cease-fire, the 
brother president said this is for the legitimate leadership to 
decide; the secessionists have to submit to the Security Council 
resolution, or else they will have to submit to the force of 
Yemeni legitimacy's military. 
  Asked how he felt about the Gulf Cooperation Council's 
stance 
on the situation in Yemen and whether he deemed it personal or 
political meddling in Yemen's domestic affairs, the brother 
president said: We had wished that efforts and good offices 
would be brought to bear by neighboring states on the bilateral 
level. We never wanted these efforts exerted by the brothers to 
adopt such a resolution at the Security Council. This is 
because if these efforts had been made within the framework of 
bilateral contacts and relations, they would have been welcomed, 
and we might have arrived at better results, short of escalating 
the situation and going to the Security Council so the Yemeni 
issue would be dealt with within an international framework. If 
the neighbors had cared for Yemeni blood, they would have 
refrained from adopting such decisions and meddling in our 
internal affairs, and consequently the matter would probably 
have ended. 
  The brother president noted that interference in our 
country's internal affairs could prolong the conflict. He hoped 
that others would stay out of this affair and stop their 
diplomatic activity out of concern for Yemen. He said that if 
they halt this activity, then probably the problem would be 
solved immediately. However, the more they act politically and 
the more they interfere in Yemen's internal affairs, the longer 
the conflict will continue in our country. 
  Asked what if the sons of Aden say they are not willing to 
join legitimacy, the brother president said: The Yemeni people 
are one and the operations carried out at the entrances of Aden 
are against rebellious elements that have departed from 
constitutional legitimacy. We are doing our best to spare 
civilians any harm. We are opposing the rebellious elements 
that are entrenched behind the civilians. When those elements 
are arrested or if they surrender or flee, then the government 
is fully prepared to move all the state institutions to Aden 
Governorate to provide all food and medical supplies, rebuild 
the city, and repair telephone, electricity, and water networks, 
and others. 
  The brother president added: We are preparing for a campaign 
in which all institutions and bodies will improve the conditions 
of Aden, whose status as a commercial and economic capital will 
be better than its status before the establishment of unity on 
22 May 1990 and during the interim period, during which the 
separatists had attempted to tighten their grip on the heroic 
city of Aden, the commercial and economic capital. Thus, Aden 
will be just like the political capital, Sanaa, which 
accommodates the sons of Yemen from all the governorates of the 
republic, and not from a certain region or faction. 
  The government will also provide care and attention so that 
Aden will witness prosperous trade activity in the future, since 
it is considered a free zone. Its status will be better than 
ever before, especially after evicting what is left of the 
forces of traitors and secessionists. There will be civilian 
police in Aden to maintain order, but it will not be the way it 
was before -- an arsenal of weapons in the hands of the 
secessionist, which they had inherited from the socialist camp, 
in addition to the weapons they acquired during the interim 
period, particularly since 19 August [1993] after the veil was 
lifted from the face of the traitor, agent, deviator al-Bid. 
  The brother president reiterated that the status of Aden 
will 
be better than any other capital, as a major port of the Yemeni 
Republic. We will give it our utmost attention and care, he 
said. 
  Answering a question on how differences between brothers had 
turned into a war in which the loser will be the Yemeni people, 
the brother president said: We had wished that the brothers 
would not turn personal and bilateral differences -- that could 
happen between one country and another for cumulative reasons -- 
into settling scores. We regret that these differences have 
claimed the lives of the sons of the Yemeni people in return for 
settling scores. The people should have blamed each other at 
bilateral meetings and through dialogue and diplomatic channels. 
If the differences are between persons, governments, or 
leaders, then these should not be allowed to harm the Yemeni 
homeland, which will have negative repercussions on bilateral 
relations between the neighboring countries. 
  In reply to a question on whether he is willing to discuss 
all issues, including the issue of unity, with the other side, 
which is setting the precondition of a cease-fire for any talks, 
the brother president said: There can be no dialogue with the 
secessionists. Dialogue can be held only with the leaders who 
have been subdued by the secessionists, who have received a 
price for the blood of the Yemenis shed on the Yemeni scene. 
There can be no dialogue with the secessionists. God willing, 
if the UN Security Council resolution is complied with, and if 
the unity-orientated elements operating in Aden are allowed to 
come out and make their voices heard, then we can hold a 
dialogue with them. However, there can be no dialogue with the 
elements whose names were mentioned in the decision issued by 
the Public Prosecution Office. This is because these elements 
are behind the ordeal being experienced by the homeland. They 
will either be apprehended and tried, or they will have to leave 
the homeland, just as the Hamid-al-Din family left it. This is 
because they are more dangerous than the Hamid-al-Din family. 
Some traitors have begun to make arrangements for their 
departure for some Arab and foreign capitals. 
  The brother president noted that traitor al-Bid, the 
archleader of this gang, is currently making preparations to 
flee the country. He added that the forces of legitimacy will 
continue their efforts to pursue him. God willing, they will 
manage to apprehend him. 
  When queried about the future of inter-Arab ties against the 
background of the Yemeni crisis and the conflicting Arab stands 
on it, given the fact that the Gulf crisis has caused a wide 
rift in inter-Arab ties, the brother president said: It is our 
hope that the repercussions of the Gulf crisis will become a 
thing of the past. The repercussions of this crisis should not 
affect the situation in Yemen, because Yemen had nothing at all 
to do with what happened during the Gulf crisis. This is 
reminiscent of the unfair campaign and the biased media, which 
attempted to misrepresent Yemen's stand during the Gulf crisis. 
During that campaign, it was alleged that Yemen had tactical 
and strategic missiles, Iraqi aircraft, and an Iraqi army on its 
soil; and that this was part of a scheme. As a matter of fact, 
it has become clear to the entire world that all these 
allegations were baseless. This harmed the credibility of some 
media organizations that promoted these allegations to the Arab 
and world public. He noted that this media bias and 
misrepresentation of facts is being repeated at present. The 
situation in Yemen is being misrepresented. Most regrettably, 
some fraternal Arabs are engaged in this to settle some scores 
in bilateral ties. These Arabs seek to take advantage of what 
is taking place in Yemen nowadays. He regretted this, and hoped 
that the Arab media will shoulder their responsibilities toward 
the Arab nation's causes. 
  The brother president noted the misrepresentation of facts 
carried out by some media organizations, which transmitted 
footage of the legitimacy forces while they were engaged in 
military operations, and claimed that these forces were the 
forces of apostacy and secession. Thus, these media 
organizations lost their credibility, because the Arab public is 
aware of their bias. 
  The brother president reiterated that these practices 
prompted our people to line up in a mammoth support of their 
unity. These practices also enabled them to identify those who 
oppose their unity. 
  Asked about his expectations concerning the visit of the 
envoy of the UN secretary general, the brother president said: 
First, we have faith in political dialogue. Since the eruption 
of the crisis, we have made immense efforts to reach a solution 
with the secessionists. This dialogue lasted almost nine 
months. It resulted in the drafting of the accord document. 
This document reflected our sense of responsibility, which was 
dictated by a desire on our part to avoid the situation 
currently plaguing the homeland and avert a military solution. 
  The brother president added: We welcome political dialogue. 
We do not believe that the military solution is the only 
possible solution. However, it was imposed on us by the 
secessionists, who received huge amounts of filthy money. They 
had been supplied with weapons before they decided to espouse 
the war option. During the crisis, they were supplied with a 
squadron of Sukhoi aircraft, not to mention a quantity of 
self-propelled guns enough to equip two battalions, received 
from Bulgaria and Hungary. The cost of each of these guns was 
$5 million. Some 400 tanks in the possession of the 
secessionists have been seized, not to mention almost 500 guns, 
approximately 300 track armored vehicles, wheeled armored 
vehicles, and large amounts of ammunition. 
  The brother president indicated that he has information 
regarding new contracts to purchase one MiG-29 aircraft 
squadron, several T-82 tanks, and tactical missiles. 
Nonetheless, he affirmed that the fate of these weapons will be 
similar to that suffered by previous weapons. They are 
incapable of confronting the Yemeni people. 
  The brother president called on those who are paying for 
these weapons not to repeat the mistake. He said: We say to 
those who are financing the purchase of such weapons not to make 
such a mistake again and to try to invest the money to rebuild 
what was destroyed by the war, so they will be highly 
appreciated by the Yemeni people. 
  The brother president welcomed the envoy of the UN secretary 
general and reiterated our country's readiness to cooperate with 
him to render his mission a success. Asked what will happen if 
the Unites Nations insists on dispatching international 
observers to monitor the cease-fire, the president noted that 
our country complies with the letter and spirit of the UN 
security Council. He said: We will not defy international 
legitimacy, but the separatist gang is the one that violates the 
cease-fire and gambles on instigating public opinion -- by 
claiming that our Armed Forces are not complying with the 
cease-fire -- to call in international forces. This will be 
rejected. 
  Asked about development issues and whether Yemen will 
reconsider some agreements concluded in the field of oil 
investments and in other fields, the brother president said that 
all aspects of life will be reviewed, particularly the 
agreements ratified outside the homeland by some elements of the 
separatist gang, such as [former prime minister] al-'Attas and 
[former oil minister] Bin-Husaynun. He said the government will 
be reorganized on a modern and developed basis, government 
administrative and economic institutions will be also 
reorganized, and democracy and freedom of press will be 
consolidated. He noted that the separatist leaders were one of 
the factors of frustration over the past four years, since the 
transitional period. Those leaders, he added, did not want our 
people in the southern and eastern governorates to enjoy the 
fruits of unity. The brother president that everything will be 
reviewed to guarantee that every governorate in the republic 
will enjoy the goodness of unity. He noted that the traitors 
from the separatist elements were a stumbling block to social, 
political, and cultural progress despite the political slogans 
raised in their political platform. He said: They were not 
concerned about our people's interests inasmuch as they were 
concerned about their personal interests. The big evidence of 
this is that they withdrew part of the people's money and 
deposited them in their bank accounts in Europe and elsewhere. 
  The brother president said that thanks to the efforts and 
cohesion of all people we will proceed toward achieving 
agricultural and industrial development and digging out mineral 
and oil resources to benefit our Yemeni people. He stressed 
that the government will offer all facilities and support for 
national and foreign investments to build the Yemeni homeland, 
noting in this regard that observers and journalists have 
noticed the great progress we achieved in the field of 
development before unity. However, the factors of apostasy and 
secession in the YSP worked, in the wake of establishing the 
unity, toward aborting the development, as they frustrated our 
people in Aden, Lahij, Abyan, Shabwah, Hadhramaut, and 
al-Mahrah. This is because these elements have nothing but 
political platforms. They exploited all potentials, state 
revenues, and loans for their own interests during the pre-unity 
period. However, when we make promises to our people, we keep 
these promises. 
  The president said: We will work to expand participation in 
the government so that this participation will include all 
influential political forces and producing forces which will 
join hands to rebuild what was destroyed by the destructive war 
and achieve comprehensive awakening. He noted that the 
difficult ordeal facing our people now has produced this 
splendid coherence to defend unity and democracy, safeguard 
security and stability, and confront all the secessionist 
elements that tried to undermine the gains of the people, 
expressing his satisfaction with national coherence. 
  The president then wished the pressmen success in their 
work.

al-Iryani, minister of planning and development; Ahmad Hasan 
al-Lawzi, minister of information; and a number of officials.

<F P=106> [Interview with President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih in Sanaa by </F>
Amir Taheri in London; date not given] 
  [Text] [Taheri] After more than five weeks since the 
fighting began, do you believe that resorting to force was 
unavoidable? 
  [Salih] That question suggests that it was Sanaa which 
resorted to force. We would like to stress to you that we went 
to impossible lengths to avert the fighting. It would take a 
long time and numerous pages to explain all that in detail. 
Nevertheless, we are willing to reply to any suggestion that 
Sanaa was working for a military solution to the crisis, which 
was prepared and stirred up by known leaders in the Socialist 
Party who were preparing to implement its military aims at least 
10 months before the fighting began. Numerous states have 
irrefutable evidence of this, namely the arms supplies which 
were delivered secretly to al-Mukalla and Aden ports with 
financing from some states in the region. 
  Sanaa is certain that al-Bid's return to Aden on 19 August 
1993 and his remaining there until the day he moved (to 
Hadhramaut) and his refusal to return to Sanaa after the signing 
of the Pledge and Accord Document in Amman on 20 February, after 
Aden's failure to engage in a long-term confrontation with the 
al-'Amaliqah forces in Abyan on the same evening the signing 
took place...all this was part of the conspiracy which resulted 
in the current state of war. So Sanaa cannot be accused of 
preparing for this war. And if you have any doubts in this 
connection, we want you to provide evidence of your doubts so we 
can reply to them more clearly. 
  [Taheri] What can the Yemeni leadership achieve through 
military confrontation that it cannot achieve through 
negotiation? 
  [Salih] We confirm to you that negotiation and dialogue were 
the Presidential Council chairman's preferred option. The 
military option was imposed by the other party, because his real 
aim since he fabricated the crisis on 19 August 1993 was to 
impose secession by force -- which so far he has failed to 
achieve. 
  Thus we stress that the political leadership in Sanaa can 
achieve all its aims through dialogue as long as this dialogue 
is based on constitutional legitimacy, adherence to Yemeni 
unity, and compliance with the results of the 27 April 1993 
elections. But if the secessionists are seeking to achieve 
through dialogue what they have failed to achieve by force, they 
will suffer a more severe failure than their military failure. 
  [Taheri] Under what conditions would the Yemeni leadership 
be willing to accept a halt to the operations, starting with 
agreeing to the cease-fire? 
  [Salih] A cease-fire is not a problem for us, because our 
Armed Forces have been able to destroy the huge military 
equipment the rebels inherited from their close relations with 
the Warsaw Pact and as a result of the huge supplies they 
purchased before and after fabricating the crisis through 
al-Bid's return to Aden, and with finance from some Gulf 
Cooperation Council states. However, we do not conceal that we 
are very concerned that the Security Council resolution is 
nothing but a prelude to new accusations to be fabricated 
against the Republic of Yemen and its political leadership for 
the sake of passing new resolutions or justifying blatant 
interference in our internal affairs, especially as we had 
bitter experience in the early sixties during the conflict 
between monarchists and republicans. 
  [Taheri] Under what conditions and within what framework 
do you expect the Security Council to play a role in ending the 
armed conflict? 
  [Salih] We are certain that the Security Council's role in 
ending the existing dispute cannot transcend the existing 
legitimacy. Proof of this is the situation the government of 
north Cyprus has been experiencing for about 20 years. You know 
who is behind it. But we cannot ignore the possibility that 
Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas may become a second Denktas. However, 
he cannot achieve at the international level more than his 
opposite number has achieved. 
  [Taheri] Are you demanding the restoration of the situation 
that existed before the fighting erupted? Or is your government 
willing to negotiate a new formula for unity with the southern 
leadership? 
  [Salih] The Yemeni leadership is demanding nothing from 
anyone under the legitimate unity announced on 22 May 1990 on 
the basis of legal and constitutional foundations governed by 
the laws in force in what used to be called the Yemen Arab 
Republic and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. The 
Republic of Yemen was established on the basis of the 
constitutional rules and legal stipulations that governed the 
two countries. After the announcement of the unified state, the 
Constitution, over which we negotiated for 10 years, became the 
foundation of the new entity. After the announcement of the 
Republic of Yemen, a referendum was conducted on the new state's 
Constitution, on which the inhabitants of the republic 
overwhelmingly agreed. Nearly three years after the state was 
announced, general elections were held, and the world attested 
they were honest. Then the coalition government you know was 
formed. Despite all this, the secessionists relied in their 
announcement on House of Representatives members loyal to them, 
who had been elected by the people under the Constitution of the 
Republic of Yemen and the electoral law ratified by the House of 
Representatives, whose speaker was a prominent member of the 
Socialist Party, which is now seeking a new legitimacy for 
itself. So can there be any other demands for us to submit to 
the secessionists except the abolition of their decision to 
secede? If that is not achieved through legitimate channels 
internationally, I am certain that the Yemeni people are capable 
of achieving their unionist aims. And we stress to you that the 
preceding means that we are not willing to accept any formula. 
  [Taheri] Are there any mediation efforts which enjoy the 
Presidential Council's support? Or is the aim to achieve a 
decisive and complete victory on the battlefield? 
  [Salih] We believe that it is the secessionists who 
desperately need to achieve a decisive military victory on the 
battlefield, because that is the only way to prove their 
legitimacy. As for the legitimate authority in the Republic of 
Yemen, it does not need to do that, because it cares very much 
about every citizen's life, and shedding citizens' blood cannot 
be a means to prove its legitimacy. It is the rebels who need 
to prove their legitimacy by shedding the Yemenis' blood. 
  On that basis, we have confronted them firmly and 
powerfully, 
because we know who is behind them. And we can clearly tell you 
now that we are not fighting a party that obtained 25 percent of 
the citizens' votes. It represents a minority that cannot be 
relied on. We are facing a foreign scheme.

  [Text] A number of political parties and organizations in 
the Republic of Yemen have stressed that the Yemeni people are 
capable of destroying a band of rebellious adventurers who have 
acquiesced in plunging our people into a painful and bloody 
conflict that can only advance the interests of the enemies of 
Yemen and the attempt to take it back to the pre-May 1990 era. 
  The political parties and organizations also stand ready to 
confront all the conspiracies that are targeting Yemen and to 
make sacrifices in the cause of its national rights -- unity, 
democracy, and freedom. 
  A statement, issued by 24 political parties and 
organizations, said that what the rebels are doing today is a 
cheap attempt to forcibly slice off a part of the Republic of 
Yemen. The Yemeni masses, who on 22 May 1990, thronged to the 
streets to celebrate the inauguration of the Republic of Yemen 
and the realization of unity -- the dream of their fathers and 
forefathers -- and [word indistinct] self-determination. The 
masses, who said yes to the 15 May 1991 Constitution of the 
Republic and went to the polls in the first free and fair 
elections in the region -- even in the Arab world at large -- 
are the same masses who are now taking a determined stand 
against their rebellious and adventurous enemies. 
  The remarks made by the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] on 
Yemen, added the statement, amount to a serious precedent that, 
rather than advance security and stability in the Peninsula, 
opens the road for many conflicts in each of the states of the 
region and creates the potential for negative and unwanted 
consequences. The statement paid tribute to the brother State 
of Qatar's lone voice at the ministerial session of the GCC with 
respect to the unity of the Republic of Yemen. All Arab states

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, "envoy of the </F>
South Yemeni president to the United Nations," by Hanan al-Badri 
in Washington; date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Al-Badri] What steps will 
the southern leadership take if Sanaa backtracks on its 
acceptance of the cease-fire? 
  [Al-Dali] We have in our hands the constitutional and legal 
right to defend ourselves against any attack or invasion by the 
Sanaa authorities. And we -- the victims of aggression -- are 
internationally entitled to seek assistance from any friendly or 
fraternal state. So in accordance with international law, we 
are entitled to seek foreign assistance. 
  [Al-Badri] Will the confrontation escalate if Sanaa does not 
comply fully with international law? And we ask: Why have you 
not over the past two weeks used Scud missiles, as you have a 
stockpile of them? Is it because you have been subjected to 
pressures urging you to comply with the diplomatic efforts 
seeking to achieve the aim of securing recognition for the south? 
  [Al-Dali] I would like to stress that we support the policy 
of nonescalation. Because we indeed wish to end this conflict. 
But our adherence to the policy of nonescalation does not at all 
mean that we are unable to retaliate. If the situation 
escalates today, tomorrow, or after tomorrow, we will reply 
powerfully. As for the use of the Scud batteries, our military 
commanders should be asked about it. They know what should be 
done in these conditions. At any rate, we can, of course, 
resort to using this type of missiles to protect civilians from 
air raids. 
  [Al-Badri] But what about the recognition issue, which is 
one of the most important issues Sanaa is concerned about? 
  [Al-Dali] I believe that international recognition of Aden 
is proceeding unhindered. It will most certainly take place. 
And we feel that the Sanaa rulers have begun to lose control of 
the situation and express -- in word and deed -- the state of 
alarm and confusion they are experiencing. 
  [Al-Badri] We heard that you have obtained strong promises 
from the permanent member states of the Security Council of 
their move toward granting recognition. 
  [Al-Dali] As I said, recognition of Aden is most certainly 
on the way. Very soon fraternal states and then friendly 
states, first and foremost the permanent member states of the 
Security Council, will announce their recognition of Aden as an 
independent political entity, as was the situation in the past. 
  [Al-Badri] Did you raise with the Americans and the United 
Nations the issue of sending international forces to protect 
civilians in the south and observe the cease-fire? 
  [Al-Dali] I personally did not raise that matter, nor was I 
assigned to do so. But if the situation becomes critical, we 
will demand that. We rely in an action like that on the 
foundations of international legitimacy and the UN Charter.

  [Text] Dr. Sayf Sayil Khalid, Politburo member and member 
of the Central Committee of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], 
met today with the citizens of the town of Dar Sa'd following 
the haphazard artillery shelling launched from the Sanaa regime, 
which targeted the populated living quarters in the town of Dar 
Sa'd. Some families and innocent children were victims of this 
shelling. Dr. Sayf Sayil praised the high morale of the citizens 
and their persistence and readiness to resist in the face of the 
conspirators on the security, stability, and welfare of the 
people. 
  In this connection he called for the necessity of organizing 
the popular resistance to protect our beautiful city against the 
conspiracies of the enemies. He said: We will not allow Aden 
to be occupied, no matter what. He emphasized that the citizens 
of the capital, Aden, are considered to come from all the 
villages and regions of Yemen and that going to the resistance 
fronts reflects the real pattern of unity of the sons of the 
Yemeni people. 
  In the context of his talk with the citizens of the sons of 
Dar Sa'd, Dr. Sayf Sayil indicated that the inhabitants, men and 
women, all of them joined the Armed Forces to defend Aden. He 
said that this mad war had targeted the Yemeni people, whether 
on a human, economic or military scale. The instigators and 
causers of this war will be cursed by history, he said, adding 
that the will of the people is stronger than the will of the 
crazy adventurous rulers. Victory will be only with the people, 
he said.

  [Text] Our informed military sources in Sanaa inform that 
there is an obscure difference between the ranks of the 
commanders and officers in north Yemen on the issue of the 
failed war which was led by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih against the 
people in the Democratic Republic of Yemen. The information 
says that secret meetings were held during the last three days 
between the groups of the non-Sanhanian [not further identified] 
commanders, which made 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih issue orders to 
collect all the forces and means that remain with him and to 
raise his photographs [as heard] on them in 48 camps in an 
attempt to delude the others that he is still strong after it 
had become certain to him that his recent directives to enter 
Aden had failed. The sources confirmed that time for 'Ali Salih 
is no more gold [as heard] and he is now thinking of what will 
secure the establishment of the regime of the iron fist in Sanaa.

  [Text] Informed diplomatic and political sources in Aden 
are certain that Iran's vigorous pursuit of the question of the 
islands and its threats against the United Arab Emirates [UAE] 
come within the framework of the total coordination, alliance, 
and solidarity between this state, known for its stern 
fundamentalist system, and the military ruling regime in Sanaa, 
which is backed by the tribal fundamentalist and extremist 
Reform Party. This party is known for its close links with the 
jihad movement and fundamentalist groups in the Arab states and 
elsewhere in the world. These sources express the view that 
constant and intense contacts are being maintained between the 
governments in Iran and Sanaa within a period of less than a 
week. 
  In this respect the two foreign ministers have met while 
officials in Sanaa, the last of whom was 'Abd-al-Wahhab 
al-Anisi, the secretary general of the Reform Party, have met 
the Iranian ambassador more than three times. The sources 
stress that the pressure brought to bear on the UAE is an 
attempt to shift it away from the clear stances it has adopted 
towards the destructive war launched by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
against the people in the south of Yemen. The sources are 
surprised by this alliance now formed between Iran and Sanaa, 
recalling that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih stood strongly on the side 
of Iraq during its war with Iran and sent to Iraq over 10 
brigades to fight on Iraq's side against Iran.

  [Text] Eyewitnesses have confirmed that the head of the 
ruling regime in Sanaa, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, has personally 
executed a number of his military commanders and officers whom 
he had sent to the battlefronts, particularly those whose forces 
were routed under the blows of the forces of the young 
Democratic Republic of Yemen. The eyewitnesses, who arrived in 
Aden from Sanaa, said that the criminal, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
had executed a number of commanders of the fronts in Kharaz, 
Karish, Tawr al-Bahah and Hadramawt. The eyewitnesses also 
confirmed that the fundamentalist, Colonel 'Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar, 
and the criminal Muhammad Abdallah Salih, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's 
brother, have executed many of the commanders and officers of 
the units providing supplies, provisions and communications 
after their failure to provide their units with the necessary 
supplies for the fighting, which was thought to last less than 
24 hours.

security organs in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] in Aden have 
arrested a number of Jordanians and prevented Jordanian families 
from leaving Aden for Jordan, under the pretext that Jordan is 
participating in the war at the side of President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih. It has also been learned that Jordan is holding 
intensive contacts through other parties to release the 
Jordanian nationals held as hostages. 
  Legal Jordanian sources said: What Aden has done is strange 
and a violation of international law. The sources added that the 
Jordanians are defenseless and have not participated in the war. 
Consequently, the sources said, the safety of the Jordanian 
nationals is the responsibility of the authorities in the south 
who should not restrict the movement of or arrest those 
Jordanians.

in Hadramawt. An authoritative source at the military and 
administrative joint command of the coast of Hadramawt that the 
so-called Amir of Jihad in the Republic, Ahmad Barasin, alias 
Abu Mahdi, was killed on 7 June in the battle which took place 
between our heroic forces and the enemy group which tried to 
infiltrate the Hadramawt Province. The source added that the 
group, which was led by Barasin, was routed. It is noteworthy 
to recall that Barasin was one of the leaders of the so-called 
al-Jihad Organization in Yemen. He was accused of the terrorist 
explosions which took place in the provinces of the republic in 
previous years.

  [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 9 (AFP) -- Two northern warplanes 
were shot down on Thursday [9 June] as they bombed Aden airport 
in south Yemen, witnesses said. 
  Four planes bombed the airport area, but one slammed into 
the 
sea and a second crashed into the city's residential Shaykh 
'Usman district after running into anti-aircraft fire, they said. 
  Northern warplanes launched a second raid half an hour 
later. 
  There were no immediate details of casualties. 
  Southern warplanes based at the airport have taken part in 
bombing runs to try to stop the northern advance on Aden which 
was declared the capital of an independent state last month.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by "a responsible source at the Defense </F>
Ministry"; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpt] Our air, naval, and ground Armed Forces have 
repulsed the iniquitous and aggressive and treacherous attacks 
launched by the military ruling regime in Sanaa today on all 
fronts. Our forces were able on the Abyan, Karish, Tawr 
al-Bahah, and Kharaz fronts to defeat the invading aggressors 
having delivered against them crushing blows and inflicting on 
them the following human and material losses: four enemy 
aircraft shot down, the destruction of three tanks, six Katyusha 
rocket-launching vehicles, and three (Dushka) crews; five tanks, 
four Katyusha-launching vehicles, and three crews captured; 
hundreds of enemy officers and men killed, and numbers of others 
captured or surrendered. Our heroic forces continue decisively 
to repulse and pursue the remnants of conspiracy, aggression, 
and invasion pressed by the military ruling regime in Sanaa on 
all the battlefronts for the 45th day since the start of their 
aggressive destructive war against our people. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "An Islamic Party Takes Up Arms </F>
Against the Salvation Front"] 
  [Text] Algiers, AL-HAYAH -- Some members of the Algerian 
Transitional National Council members are trying to collect 
signatures on a petition calling for the release of the Islamic 
Salvation Front [FIS] leaders and an end to the state of 
emergency. The deputies trying to promote the petition say that 
the aim is to "support dialogue and national reconciliation." 
AL-HAYAH has learned that the party most opposed to that 
petition is the Islamic "Jihad and Unity Front" which is 
represented in the National Council by Nouari Bousnan (aged 41) 
and Kerghali Saeed (40). Sources close to that front have told 
AL-HAYAH that its leader has formed an armed battalion for 
combating "terrorism" (the word used by the authorities to 
describe the Salvation Front) in the province of El Bouira (120 
km east of the capital), active in Rabta mountains and in 
Boufadil [as transliterated] in the hills of the Kadiria 
District. The same sources confirm that the security forces 
have reinforced that battalion with some soldiers and that the 
initial results of the combing operations "have been 
encouraging." According to Algerian observers, this is the 
first time an Islamic party has participated in military 
operations alongside the Algerian security forces.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati by </F>
Nur-al-Huda Zaki in Cairo; date not given -- first paragraph is 
introduction] 
  [Text] The Iranian foreign minister views the discussions 
held by the foreign ministers of the Nonaligned Movement [NAM] 
in Cairo as a positive development in the progress of NAM. He 
says the countries of the South and the Third World realized at 
the conference that the strengthening of NAM will be in their 
interest. I asked him: What role is left to the movement now 
that the Eastern camp has collapsed? He replied: It is true 
that the Eastern camp has collapsed and gone, but subservience 
continues. Nonalignment means non-subservience. If we believe 
in this idea, we will notice that because one of the blocs 
collapsed, the other bloc is trying to strengthen its control 
and hegemony. Iran strongly believes in the need to maintain 
NAM. 
  [Zaki] Mr. Minister, you met with Egyptian Foreign Minister 
'Amr Musa. What did you discuss? 
  [Velayati] We had a good dialogue with the Egyptian side. 
There is increasing understanding between Iran and Egypt on the 
need to cooperate on regional and international issues. 
  [Zaki] Did you discuss the exchange of ambassadors between 
Cairo and Tehran? 
  [Velayati] We did not discuss that. 
  [Zaki] Did you touch on the relations between Tehran and 
Khartoum? 
  [Velayati] We did not discuss that subject either. 
  [Zaki] Have you discussed Egypt's accusations that Iran 
supports the extremist Islamic trends in Egypt? 
  [Velayati] We discussed the subject of the Islamic trends as 
a whole and as a general principle. But the accusations against 
Iran were not discussed, and were not raised in the first place. 
  [Zaki] But what is your comment on these accusations? 
  [Velayati] In general and in principle, the revival of 
Islamic values and thought cannot be ignored by anyone; nobody 
can or wants to ignore this fact. The signs of such revival are 
clear everywhere, so much so that even the pro-secularism in the 
Islamic world are now introducing their talk with "in the name 
of God, the merciful, the compassionate." I personally have 
seen this. I have also noticed that the number of Muslim women 
who wear Islamic dress has increased in recent years. This is 
not a sign of extremism, but the Western countries are trying to 
stop this trend. When Muslims return to their religion and 
somebody says that Iran forced them to do so, then this is an 
insult to them. 
  [Zaki] Excuse me, we are not talking about Islam as a 
religion and a way to worship. We are discussing political 
Islam and Iran's position on the extremist Islamic groups that 
are now confronting the civil authorities in some Arab 
countries. What is Iran's position toward those groups? 
  [Velayati] Islam is a religion of politics, and without 
politics there is no Islam. Those who argue against our opinion 
are politicizing Islam but in their own way. We do not believe 
Islam is the religion of staying in mosques. The Prophet, may 
God's peace and blessings be upon him, established a practical 
and actual government. If we want to follow the Prophet's way, 
we cannot tell those who govern in Mecca: You govern and we 
pray. But if we want a new Islam, then that is a different 
story. 
  That the Islamic countries are now returning to Islam 
reflects Muslims' disappointment with Western values. Iran did 
not tell Muslims to [sentence incomplete as published]. 
  [Zaki] But some governments are actually accusing Iran of 
supporting internal unrest in their countries. 
  [Velayati] When governments of some countries face problems 
on the domestic scene, the easiest way is to accuse foreign 
quarters. 
  [Zaki] Is there a relationship between Britain's position 
toward Iran and Iran's Islamist policy? 
  [Velayati] Britain's position toward us is certainly linked 
to the Islamic position. The Islamic countries are increasingly 
worried at Britain's stance toward the Muslims in Bosnia. The 
Islamic majority in the world is convinced that Britain's bad 
position toward the Bosnian Muslims has led things to the edge 
of tragedy and prevented a tangible solution to the problem. 
  [Zaki] Why did you not play an effective role--you are a 
major Islamic country? 
  [Velayati] Concerning Bosnia, we did all we could. Iran was 
behind all pro-Bosnia moves in the United Nations, the Islamic 
Conference Organization, and the Nonaligned Movement. 
  [Zaki] I am talking about military assistance. 
  [Velayati] I will quote the Bosnian president: "Iran 
extended all possible assistance, and proposed sending military 
aid. After that, THE WASHINGTON POST reported that Iran is 
providing military assistance to Bosnia..." and the 
responsibility lies with the newspaper." [quotation marks, 
ellipses as published] 
  [Zaki] Mr. Minister: You have met with the Iraqi foreign 
minister. Are we going to see a promotion of Iranian-Iraqi 
relations? 
  [Velayati] The issue with Iraq is different. We are engaged 
in complex [murakkabah] talks; we are moving toward reducing 
problems and then solving them. 
  [Zaki] When will you visit Baghdad? 
  [Velayati] After a month, or perhaps 40 days.

  [Text] Among the topics discussed during yesterday's 
meeting between the foreign ministers of Greece and of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran in Tehran included the further 
expansion of the Islamic Republic's relations with the European 
Union [EU] and Greece, the Balkan crisis, and the expanding 
relations between Tehran and the Central Asian republics and the 
Caucasus. 
  During the meeting Karolos Papoulias, Greek foreign minister 
and the current head of the EU, underlined the need to further 
expand relations between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the 
EU--something that can play an effective role in solving current 
problems in various parts of the world. The Greek foreign 
minister stressed that the EU's stance on the issue of the three 
Persian Gulf islands is that bilateral talks between Iran and 
the United Arab Emirates [UAE] should be strengthened. 
  At this meeting Velayati also welcomed the expansion of 
Tehran's relations with the EU and with Greece and said: The 
Islamic Republic of Iran, a country which enjoys stability in 
the region, plays a fundamental role in political equations. 
The foreign minister added: The Islamic Republic of Iran has 
always supported a peaceful solution of the misunderstandings 
with the UAE on the basis of its 1971 agreement with that 
country. He once again emphasized that regional security could 
not be possible without the cooperation of the Persian Gulf 
littoral countries.

  [Text] Tehran, June 8, IRNA -- Greek Foreign Minister 
Karolos Papoulias said here Wednesday [8 June] that talks 
between Iranian and European officials would help remove any 
obstacle in the way of relations between Iran and the European 
Union (EU). 
  Greece is now trying to improve Iran-EU relations and help 
them have "good" ties, the Greek foreign minister said in a 
joint press conference with his Iranian counterpart 'Ali Akbar 
Velayati. 
  He departed Tehran after the conference. 
  The minister expressed hope that the present impediments to 
the relations between some European countries and Iran would be 
removed. 
  Referring to the Bosnian issue, Papoulias said despite 
problems facing Europe, it is now trying to solve the issue. 
However, he admitted that the question has remained unsolved 
for europe. 
  Papoulias, terming the Bosnian issue as a European problem, 
maintained that the issue could be solved through peaceful means 
and that there would be no military solution. 
  EU member states and the permanent members of the United 
Nations Security Council in the latest meeting on the Bosnian 
crisis reached the conclusion that the Bosnian issue could be 
resolved solely through negotiations between the warring sides. 
  Velayati termed as "positive" Papolias talks with Iranian 
officials which he said focused on international issues, 
especially relations between EU and the Islamic Republic of Iran 
and on growing ties between Tehran and Athens . 
  On the issue of human rights, Velayati said that Iranian 
officials, based on their Islamic beliefs and ideology, believed 
that human rights should be respected by all countries. 
  He added that the recent meeting of the foreign ministers of 
the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) in Cairo approved that human 
rights should be observed by the third world countries with 
regard to their beliefs and ideologies. 
  Papoulias, who arrived here on Tuesday for a two-day 
official 
stay at the head of a high ranking delegation, conferred with 
president Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani and his iranian counterpart 
'Ali Akbar Velayati. 
  Papoulias and Velayati in two rounds of talks discussed 
expansion of Tehran's relations with the EU and Greece, the 
crisis in the Balkans and issues relevant to Central Asian and 
Caucasus republics.

  [Text] The U.S. Government affirmed once more its flagrant 
interference in the internal affairs of sisterly Algeria and is 
poking its nose into matters which do not concern it. 
  The U.S. President called on the Algerian Government to 
hold, 
what he called, a dialogue with the Islamic Salvation Front 
[FIS]. 
  The U.S. revealed in a press conference held in Paris 
yesterday that there were contacts between the U.S. Government 
and a number of FIS elements who are described as terrorists in 
Algeria. 
  This is not the first time that such statements have been 
issued by U.S. officials on the internal situation in Algeria in 
an attempt to dictate specific policies to this Arab country.

  [Text] Cairo [Words indistinct] JAMAHIRIYAH NEWS AGENCY -- 
An authorised source at the Arab Libyan follow-up bureau in 
Cairo has confirmed that the Great Jamahiriyah was, and still 
is, one of the most keen countries on the achievement of 
international justice, and that the Great Jamahiriyah constantly 
asserts its full commitment to the implementation of 
international law. 
  In a comment made by the authorised source regarding the 
international welcome for the implementation of the 
International Court of Justice ruling in respect of Aouzou, he 
said that the great Jamahiriyah is renowned, with the testimony 
of the world and its international body, for such plausible 
conduct, which endorses legal settlement for disputes. The 
Great Jamahiriyah previously committed itself to the ruling of 
international law regarding the continental reef with each of 
Malta and Tunisia. The Great Jamahiriyah followed the same line 
of conduct in respect of its neighbour, Chad, thus giving one 
example after the other in the settlement of disputes through 
legal means, the thing which was praised by the spokesman on 
behalf of the United Nations secretary general, who paid tribute 
to the Great Jamahiriyah for implementing the International 
Court of Justice ruling on Aouzou. 
  The source went on to say: At the time when the Great 
Jamahiriyah re-asserts its commitment on the implementation of 
international law based on judiciary legitimacy and the rule of 
law, we find that other states claiming to lead the so-called 
new world order, act towards the violation of international laws 
and conventions and has not implemented resolutions previously 
issued by the International Court of Justice, such as the ruling 
in favour of Nicaragua, despite their claim for the sovereignty 
of international legitimacy. This makes us raise the question: 
What international legitimacy do they really want or claim, the 
force of law or the law of force?

Jesus, God's peace be upon him. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] As is well-known, Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat began a visit to Morocco today. 
  At the Rabat-Salle VIP lounge he made a statement in which 
he 
praised the stances of His Majesty King Hassan II toward the 
Palestinian issue, in particular, and Arab issues, in general. 
[passage omitted] 
  On the meeting of the countries offering aid to the 
self-rule 
areas that will begin in Paris tomorrow, the Palestinian 
president said: 
  [Begin 'Arafat recording] I received an important message 
yesterday from Mr. Warren Christopher on the occasion of the 
donor countries' conference, which--God willing--will begin its 
meetings in Paris tomorrow. This message demonstrates a 
clear-cut U.S. stance that is supportive of this process and the 
Palestinian authority. It urges all donor countries to follow 
the example of the U.S. Administration in offering urgent and 
immediate aid to the national authority to enable it to perform 
its duties, particularly because we need great potential in the 
first days to be able to carry this heavy burden. [end 
recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] Leader President Saddam Husayn, may God preserve 
him, has said: At this stage, it has become clear to everyone 
that the leadership has begun to take care of some details. 
This change is for known reasons, the most important of which 
is that the leadership does not want the negative details of 
life to turn into a phenomena leading to laxity and apathy 
toward solvable issues. In life, he who believes in grand 
principles should not say that there are insoluble issues. It 
could be that not all matters are as one might wish, but nothing 
is insoluble. Some solutions may need time and capabilities 
that happen to be unavailable. But to impair the human will, 
this will lead to impotence, which starts as a feeling and turns 
into an effect with universal impact. Therefore, it is 
impermissible for the Ba'th state to age, grow old, or become 
flabby. It should remain youthful and wise at the same time. 
  These remarks were made during a meeting between the leader 
president and a number of writers, journalists, and editors in 
chief. Hamid Yusuf Hammadi, minister of culture and 
information; 'Udayy Saddam Husayn, head of the Cultural Forum in 
Iraq; and Nuri Najm al-Marsumi and Naji Sabri al-Hadithi, under 
secretaries of the Ministry of Culture and Information, attended 
the meeting. 
  His excellency, may God watch over him, added: Based on 
this, the leadership began to take care of issues that used to 
be within the tasks of ministers or directors general. This is 
because when small things impact on large and medium issues 
concerning the peoples' psychological makeup, and impact real 
life on the level of economics and politics, then the 
leaderships' actions derive their legitimacy from what we have 
just described in the people's life. The leadership wants the 
people to be happy. In accordance with our concept, happiness 
does not always come from material life, but when the stage and 
circumstances affects the material life of the people, it is 
necessary for the leadership to play a role in generating a 
feeling of happiness. 
  His excellency said: Within the historical context of rights 
and duties, the Iraqis have proven that they are qualified to do 
their duties, and that they deserve to enjoy their rights. 
Here, there will be no need to invoke history to interpret 
citizens' stands in light of the past, but this needs constant 
awareness. Under difficult circumstances, if awareness is not 
as it should be, there will be no strength to overcome an ordeal 
or a difficult circumstance, even though there is genuineness. 
  During the meeting, discussions dealt with a host of issues 
related to citizens' lives and daily affairs, the role of media 
in providing the citizens with new information and analyses, and 
in bolstering their awareness in a way to promote their strength 
and determination to overcome the effects of the unjust blockade 
on our great Iraq.

Assembly Mr. Sa'di Mahdi Salih met today Mr. Hans Sterchen, the 
chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee in the German 
parliament. 
  Mr. Salih reviewed the dimensions of the imperialist-Zionist 
reactionary plots against Iraq to impair the unity of its people 
and territories in an attempt to stop its development drive in 
all spheres. 
  He pointed out to the impact of the continued sanctions 
which 
imposed on the Iraqi people and their suffering because of the 
sharp shortage in medicine and equipments. 
  The chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and his 
delegation expressed the hope that the unjust sanctions would be 
lifted in order to put an end to the suffering of the Iraqi 
people. 
  During the meeting both sides also discussed the 
parliamentary relations between Iraq and Germany. 
  The German parliamentary delegation arrived in Baghdad 
earlier today on several days visit at the invitation of the 
National Assembly.

expressed his delight for visiting Iraq which he described as a 
country of civilizations and history across the ages. 
  He added that during his visit he would hold talks with the 
Iraqi officials on best ways to restore the relations between 
Iraq and Germany, stressing that Iraq could play a prominent 
role to serve peace and security in the region. 
  He concluded by saying that the German delegation would 
extend help to Iraq in the health and medical fields to ease the 
impact of the sanctions.

<F P=106> [Report by Zuhayr Qusaybati: "Fierce Fighting in Northern </F>
Iraq Threatens To Torpedo Reconciliation Between Kurds"] 
  [Excerpts] London -- Fierce fighting broke out yesterday 
in northern Iraq and seemed to threaten collapse of the 
reconciliation agreement between Kurdish leaders Mas'ud Barzani 
and Jalal Talabani. A source close to the Patriotic Union of 
Kurdistan [PUK] (led by Talabani) has told AL-HAYAH that "forces 
of the Kurdistan Democratic Party [KDP] (led by Barzani) as well 
as Islamic Movement forces and Iranian forces launched a major 
attack at dawn on the city of Qal'at Dizah" which is under the 
control of the PUK forces. 
  Meanwhile, Major General Hasan al-Naqib, member of the 
Presidential Council of the Iraqi National Congress [INC], has 
rejected Presidential Council Member Barzani's proposal calling 
for Iraqi Kurdistan to be declared a demilitarized "UN 
protectorate." In a statement to AL-HAYAH from his headquarters 
in Salah-al-Din, al-Naqib said that "any international 
trusteeship over any part of Iraq would not solve the internal 
problems, even if it did not further complicate these problems." 
He emphasized that "the real solution to the Kurdish question 
must be within a national unified Iraqi framework." [passage 
omitted] 
  Al-Naqib said that "the recent regrettable incidents between 
the Kurdish brothers prove that the only way to solve problems 
is dialogue and negotiation. That is one of the lessons which 
must be learned about settling differences between Kurdish and 
non-Kurdish patriotic opposition forces." He urged the Kurds to 
"show wisdom and farsightedness, let reason and logic prevail, 
and give priority to the main struggle against the dictatorial 
regime over the secondary conflicts." [passage omitted] 
  In al-Naqib's view, "the real solution to the Kurdish 
question must be within a national unified Iraqi framework 
acceptable to the Iraqi people -- Arabs, Kurds, and minorities 
-- and enjoying regional and international support." [passage 
omitted] 
  On the fighting which flared up again yesterday, a source 
close to the PUK said that "the joint attack launched by the 
KDP, the Islamic Movement, and Iranian Revolutionary Guard 
forces is supported by artillery batteries and rocket launchers 
in the Iranian area of Sar Dasht. The PUK forces have succeeded 
in recapturing the city of Qal'at Dizah (5 km from the 
Iraqi-Iranian border) whose inhabitants had to move out as a 
result of heavy shelling." He added that "the three forces on 
Monday attacked the cities of Sayyid Sadiq and Banjwin east of 
al-Sulaymaniyah and were defeated by the PUK forces." 
  He admitted that "the fierce battles" threaten to torpedo 
the 
reconciliation agreement reached between Barzani and Talabani 
after last month's fighting between their parties.

  [Text] Al-Sulaymaniyah, northern Iraq, 9 Jun (INA)--Pitched 
fighting has continued in various areas in the al-Sulaymaniyah 
Governorate between Jalal Talabani's troops on the one hand, and 
the forces of the so-called Islamic Movement and the gunmen of 
the Kurdistan Democratic Party allied with it on the other. 
  Today's edition of the newspaper AL-'IRAQ published here 
today quoted news reports originating in the al-Sulaymaniyah 
Governorate as saying that the most violent battles witnessed 
there were those waged in Qal'at Dizah, Banjwin, and Halabjah. 
The reports added that the gunmen of Mas'ud Barzani managed to 
kick Jalal Talabani's loyalists out of Qal'at Dizah and 
completely occupy the entire city after killing several of these 
loyalists. Jalal Talabani's loyalists fled the city, leaving 
behind them the bodies of their dead and wounded. Moreover, 
hundreds of citizens fled the city to neighboring villages and 
mountain caves, seeking shelter and safety. 
  The news reports also confirmed that battles continued in 
the 
areas surrounding the al-Sulaymaniyah Governorate. The elements 
of the so-called Islamic Movement, which supports Mas'ud's 
group, are attempting to control some areas inside the city of 
al-Sulaymaniyah, the reports added. Tension and fear spread to 
other areas and places in the Autonomous Region of Kurdistan 
because of the mistrust between the two groups of Mas'ud and 
Jalal.

  [Text] Cairo, 6 Jun (INA) -- Iraq has protested to the Arab 
League General Secretariat against the continued facilities 
provided by the rulers of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to U.S., 
British, and French aircraft violating Iraq's airspace, noting 
that this poses a serious threat to Iraq's security and 
sovereignty. 
  In a letter addressed to Arab League Secretary General Dr. 
'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, Iraq's permanent representative said these 
aircraft continued their violation of Iraqi airspace during the 
period 24-31 May. They carried out 352 sorties flying from 
their bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. 
  Iraq's representative asked that the letter be circulated, 
along with a list detailing the violations, to the Arab member 
states to acquaint them with these regrettable facts.

  [Text] Al-Basrah, 7 Jun (INA)--On 3 June, the aircraft of 
the vile 30-state aggression dropped four flares southeast of 
the headquarters of the 3d Army Corps in the al-Dayr area in the 
al-Basrah Governorate, east of the Shatt al-'Arab waterway.

  [Text] Intensive efforts are being exerted in all 
governorates to complete the harvest and marketing of wheat and 
barley. Meetings are being held and measures are being taken to 
provide the requirements for completing this national campaign 
on time. 
  In Baghdad, Governor Qa'id Husayn al-'Awwadi, who is also 
chairman of the governorate's Harvest and Marketing Committee, 
discussed the progress of the harvest and marketing campaign and 
the execution percentage with the heads of the administrative 
areas. 
  During the meeting, which was attended by the comrades 
secretaries of al-Rashid and Abu-Ja'far al-Mansur party 
branches, the conferees said it is essential for the heads of 
administrative areas to personally follow the harvest and 
marketing campaign, observe any obstacles, overcome them, and 
punish those held responsible. 
  In Ninawa, efforts continue to carry out the wheat and 
barley 
harvest and marketing campaign in the administrative areas in 
the governorate. Comrade Ahmad Khalaf Hamadah, secretary of the 
al-Walid group in the Mosul party branch, told AL-THAWRAH that 
the barley harvest has reached 80 percent in Tall 'Afar District 
and al-'Ayadiya region, and 20 percent in Rabi'ah and Zamar 
areas. He said efforts are still being intensified to finish 
the wheat harvest on time. 
  The committee supervising the harvest and marketing campaign 
in Dhi Qar held an expanded meeting to discuss the campaign and 
the stages which have been covered so far. During this meeting, 
which was attended by Governor Salah 'Abbud Mahmud and heads of 
the administrative areas, the conferees affirmed the role of the 
subcommittees in following up the work of harvesters throughout 
the day and to urge and compel peasants and farmers to market 
all their crop and to take firm measures against those who fail 
to do so. 
  The campaign for harvesting wheat and barley began in the 
plantations of al-Suwayyib, Saddamiyat al-Qurnah, and al-Nashwah 
in al-Basrah Governorate yesterday. During his supervision of 
the farmers, Governor Lutayyif Mahal Humud called for the best 
and maximum use of agricultural machines and for manual harvest 
of smaller areas. 
  Al-Muthanna Governorate has carried out 70 percent of the 
manual harvest of wheat and barley in the al-Samawah, 
al-Rumaythah, and al-Khadir Districts, and in the al-Majd, 
al-Hilal, al-Warka', and al-Najmi Subdistricts. Governor Muhsin 
Khadir al-Khafaji said harvest operations are continuing to 
cover the remaining areas. He said 32 harvesters are being used 
daily to carry out the harvest in all areas on time. He said 
the current grain season is excellent thanks to the great 
efforts exerted by the agricultural committees in order to 
achieve self-sufficiency and to abort the unfair blockade on our 
struggler people.

<F P=106> [Report by Qasim al-Ma'mar] </F>
  [Text] Our righteous peasants and farmers are making 
greater efforts in the general national campaign to harvest 
wheat and barley in all parts of the country. 
  Sajar Zubayr Ja'atah, president the General Federation of 
Cooperative Peasant Societies, told AL-THAWRAH: The necessary 
measures have been taken to bring this campaign to a successful 
conclusion. Supervisory committees have been set up and 
Executive Bureau members have been appointed in various 
governorates to coordinate with the local federation branches 
and unions on how to overcome any obstacles facing the campaign. 
  Ja'atah added: Priority has been given to the manual 
harvesting of small plots belonging to families of martyrs, 
POW's, and the missing in action. The mechanized harvesting of 
large areas of wheat and barley is continuing at the same time. 
  Ja'atah called on peasants and farmers to work to complete 
the harvest by the established deadlines, avoid waste, sell all 
their crops to the receiving stores, centers, and silos, and 
block those who tamper with prices and those who hesitate to 
market their crop. 
  The president of the federation praised the unlimited care 
and attention given by the beloved leader of the people Saddam 
Husayn to the agricultural sector. He pointed out that 
meritorious prizes and rewards will be given to outstanding 
peasants in the harvest and marketing operations, according to 
the rules.

<F P=106> [Article by AL-THAWRAH correspondents] </F>
  [Text] The country's governorates are currently witnessing 
great efforts and intensive activities to carry out the plan for 
harvesting and marketing wheat and barley. Governors are 
following up operations and officials are holding meetings and 
making field visits to meet the requirements of the campaign. 
  In Najaf, the mechanized harvest of wheat and barley, which 
began on 25 April and continued for 25 days, was completed 
yesterday. Governor Karim Hasan Rida, who is also chairman of 
the Higher Harvest Committee, said the committee followed the 
progress of the campaign through seven subcommittees and that 
13,000 peasants and farmers and 169 harvesters took part in the 
campaign. 
  In Babil, Iskandariyah Subdistrict witnessed a large-scale 
campaign for the mechanized harvest of wheat and barley. 
Several harvesters were used in the campaign, which was 
supervised by Governor al-Hakam Hasan 'Ali and the comrade 
secretary of the Babil party branch. 
  In Diyala, the Higher Harvest and Marketing Committee held a 
meeting with harvester owners and agricultural teams to discuss 
the progress of the campaign, the obstacles facing this 
campaign, and the means of overcoming them. During this 
meeting, which was attended by Governor Tu'mah Du'ayyif Qitan, 
the conferees affirmed the importance of operating harvesters at 
full capacity and carrying out the plan of maneuvering these 
harvesters from one area to another in order to cover the entire 
cultivated area, complete the campaign on time, and ensure all 
the other requirements. 
  In Dhi Qar, the agricultural committees supervising the 
campaign for harvesting wheat and barley continue their expanded 
meetings to discuss the progress of the campaign. A meeting 
attended by Governor Salah 'Abbud affirmed the importance of 
using harvesters in the most efficient manner possible, to 
maneuver these harvesters from one administrative unit to 
another, and to urge the peasants to sell all of their crop to 
the marketing centers. The committees in charge of the 
marketing centers have also been instructed to pay the prices of 
the crops to the peasants and farmers on the spot. 
  In another development, title deeds for 380 housing plots 
have been distributed to deserving families in al-Rifa'i 
District. The distribution took place at a ceremony during 
which the beneficiaries expressed their great appreciation to 
leader President Saddam Husayn. In a statement to AL-THAWRAH, 
Dhi Qar Governor Salah 'Abbud praised the efforts being exerted 
to prepare as many housing plots as possible so that they can be 
distributed to other beneficiaries this year. 
  Agricultural teams in Karbala' Governorate have carried out 
80 percent of the campaign for harvesting and marketing wheat 
and barley. Governor 'Abd-al-Khaliq 'Abd-al-'Aziz said the 
governorate has made all the necessary preparations to complete 
the campaign even before the deadline. He added that the 
governorate has assigned four marketing centers in the 
provincial capital, 'Ayn al- Tamr, and al-Hindiyah districts and 
al-Husayniyah subdistrict. 
  The campaign for harvesting and marketing wheat and barley 
continues in Ninawa Governorate. Governor 'Abd-al-Wahid Shannan 
Al Ribat, who is also head of the agricultural committee, 
supervised the harvest and marketing operations in Sinjar and 
al-Ba'aj Districts. During a meeting with peasants and farmers, 
the governor called for redoubled efforts to complete the 
mechanized harvest and to deliver the crops to the receiving 
centers so as to ensure food for the sons of the steadfast Iraqi 
people. The meeting was attended by the comrade secretaries of 
Ninawa and Musul party branches.

<F P=106> [Report by Najwa 'Abd-al-'Aziz] </F>
  [Text] Counselor 'Abd-al-Sami' Sharaf-al-Din, Public 
Attorney at the Higher State Security Prosecution Office, 
yesterday decided to remand in custody members of a Muslim 
Brotherhood organization for 15 days pending investigations. He 
ordered the items seized with the members to be sent for 
examination by forensic and laboratory experts. 
  Security men have arrested 11 members of the organization in 
several governorates. They include doctors, education experts, 
furniture dealers, students, and civil servants. Investigations 
conducted by District Attorney Sharif 'Abd-al-Nabi and Hisham 
Badawi with the organization members have uncovered secret cells 
formed by the organization in four governorates. According to 
the investigations, the new organization is an extension of the 
"Salsabil" organization uncovered a few years ago. The 
prosecutors charged members of the new organization with forming 
a consultative council, planning the overthrow of the regime, 
and preparing antiregime organizational documents and leaflets. 
The members used computers to keep information, and computer 
discs have been seized. The defendants informed officials on the 
remaining members of the organization in the other governorates. 
The prosecutors charged them with joining a secret organization 
that seeks to overthrow the regime.

<F P=106> [Interview with Muslim Brotherhood Deputy Guide Mustafa </F>
Mashhur by Khalid Sayyid Ahmad; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Ahmad] Is the Muslim Brotherhood a lawful group? 
  [Mashhur] The Muslim Brotherhood group has been in existence 
and operating since 1928. A decision dissolving the group was 
issued in 1948, but was revoked in 1951. In January 1954, a new 
decision dissolving the group was issued and most of its members 
were arrested. Later, we got out of prison and resumed our 
activity, which was tantamount of a revocation of that decision. 
Since then, no decision has been made to dissolve the group. 
Now the government claims that the group has been dissolved, 
and a lawsuit on the matter is still pending before an Egyptian 
court. Despite all this, we are a lawful group that promotes 
God's words by reason, not violence. 
  [Ahmad] How do you view the issue of violence and extremism? 
  [Mashhur] We do not believe in violence, because it distorts 
Islam's image. We have emphasized this position several times. 
Violence is a disease that can afflict a society. I can confirm 
that none of the Muslim Brotherhood members have taken part in 
any acts of violence. We did not even try to seek retaliation 
or vengeance against those who practiced violence against us 
while in detention. Although we reject the use of violence, we 
must not hold the youth who use violence fully responsible. The 
state shares in a major part of the responsibility. It has 
permitted a group of communists to distort the image of Islam. 
It also did not try to solve many of the economic and social 
problems, not to mention the way it is handling the issue of 
violence, which depends on the policy of physical liquidation. 
All this forces the youngsters to use violence. 
  [Ahmad] Is the idea of mediation [between government and 
Islamists] still on the table? 
  [Mashhur] We did not interfere in the issue of mediation and 
we did not impose ourselves on the government, because it did 
not ask us to. We are just trying to express our opinion in 
this problem, because the matter requires more dialogue, an end 
to repression, unleashing of freedoms, and the application of 
ordinary laws so that this predicament could be overcome. 
  [Ahmad] What is your opinion on the issue of national 
dialogue? 
  [Mashhur] The subject was raised eight months ago. Despite 
this, the government excluded some political forces that are 
active in the Egyptian society and relied on parties that have 
no presence in the society. The matter needs dialogue, 
understanding, and individuals freely elected by the people so 
they can represent them and express their views and needs. 
  [Ahmad] Who will represent the Islamists at the national 
dialogue table? 
  [Mashhur] The Muslim Brotherhood has been excluded so far, 
but we could say that some writers who belong to the Islamic 
current could represent the Islamists. As for the Labor Party, 
it represents itself and does not represent the Muslim 
Brotherhood. The same goes for the Muslim Brotherhood, which 
cannot represent the Labor Party. 
  [Ahmad] Is reaching power one of your goals? 
  [Mashhur] We are always accused of attempting to reach for 
power, but power does not interest us. All we want is the 
application of the Islamic shari'ah, which comes from God. If 
someone applies and rules under the Islamic shari'ah, we will 
stand behind and support him. 
  [Ahmad] Do you believe in dialogue with the other side 
[secularists]? 
  [Mashhur] There is no direct contacts or dialogue with them. 
We say what we believe and they say what they believe. But many 
of the National Progressive Unionist Grouping Party's members 
abuse us, because the Islamic line bothers them. Despite this, 
whenever there is a public issue that relates to freedoms in 
Egypt and requires dialogue, there is no reason why such 
dialogue cannot be held, because it serves the common good.

  [Text] Cairo, 9 Jun (MENA)--The newspaper AL-AKHBAR has 
stated that the United States' objection to the Security 
Council's doing its duty in condemning the latest bestial 
Israeli aggression against south Lebanon, which constitutes a 
serious violation of the sovereignty of an independent state, 
makes Washington lose a great deal of credibility, at least in 
the Arab world and in most countries of the third world. In an 
editorial published today, the paper stressed that what is even 
more serious is that U.S. attempts to save Israel from the 
consequences of its aggressive actions will encourage Tel Aviv 
rulers to continue their blatant behavior with impunity. This 
attitude threatens the peace process in which the U.S. 
Administration states it plays the role of partner. 
  AL-AKHBAR noted the surprise caused by U.S. President 
Clinton's attempts to bar the Security Council from passing a 
resolution condemning the Israeli aggression, which left 
approximately 130 people dead or injured. The paper also noted 
the denunciation of the Israeli behavior by many Western nations 
at a time when peace negotiations are supposed to be taking 
place with the participation of Israel, Syria, and Lebanon. 
Voicing hope that Washington will reconsider its stance, the 
paper stated that if Washington does not want to condemn its 
ally or at least advise it to exercise self-restraint, it should 
allow the international organization responsible for deterring 
the aggression the opportunity to do its duty.

  [Text] Dr. Usamah al-Baz, first Foreign Ministry under 
secretary and director of the President's Office for Political 
Affairs, has stated that Egypt is closely watching the situation 
in fraternal Yemen out of its concern for the Yemeni people's 
interests and the Arab nation's interests in this strategic part 
of the Arab homeland. He said that Egypt hopes fighting among 
the sons of fraternal Yemen will stop as soon as possible. It 
also hopes that the Arab League and UN efforts on this regard 
will succeed. 
  Al-Baz made this statement after receiving Lakhdar Ibrahimi, 
envoy of UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali, who later 
departed for Sanaa.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin by </F>
Shlomo Ganor, in the studio on 8 June -- recorded in Hebrew with 
Arabic subtitles; translated from the Hebrew] 
  [Excerpt] [Ganor] Dr. Beilin, what agreements were reached 
between the Israeli and Jordanian delegations in Washington 
during their two-day session? 
  [Beilin] I think that a much more solid common denominator 
was reached, an additional tier was laid for the Declaration of 
Principles signed on 14 September last year. The most important 
thing is that the talks will continue next month in our region, 
apparently both in Jordan and in Israel. I hope that the 
proximity of the talks will also make them more intensive and 
that we will be able to reach agreement on all the issues on the 
agenda in the next few months. 
  [Ganor] To what do you attribute the change in the Jordanian 
position? 
  [Beilin] I do not regard myself as an expert on Jordanian 
affairs. Last September I thought we would be able to score 
quick progress. For some reason, it was the Jordanians that 
slowed down the rate of progress. I am glad that today they are 
willing to facilitate the process, and I hope this will end in a 
peace agreement with us. 
  [Ganor] Does the change in the Jordanian position indicate 
that a similar change can be expected to take place in the 
Syrian position? 
  [Beilin] I find it difficult to believe that the 
Palestinian, 
Jordanian, and Syrian tracks are unrelated. I believe that we 
have a very good chance of reaching an agreement with Syria 
within a relatively short period of time, that is, within 
several months, because we have a common denominator regarding 
three issues: A willingness to reach peace; a willingness to 
implement a withdrawal on the Golan Heights; and a willingness 
to have intensive U.S. involvement in order to facilitate the 
process. Granted all this, I believe it will be possible to 
complete the whole process. 
  [Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television Network in Hebrew at 
1700 
GMT on 8 June adds: "U.S. and Israeli sources say that Syria 
will agree to move the talks with Israel to our region in the 
near future and hold them in al-Qunaytirah on the Golan Heights 
and possibly in Tiberias as well. The sources added that 
Jordan's agreement to hold the talks in al-'Aqabah and Elat was 
given only after receiving the OK from Damascus."] [passage

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay </F>
Gur by Ya'aqov Eylon and Mikhal Gazit; place not given -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Eylon] Mr. Gur, is the 
attitude emanating from Amman inspired by Damascus? 
  [Gur] No. Unfortunately, Damascus is still unyielding. So 
far the Damascus attitude has been projected through the actions 
of Hizballah, rather than peaceful advances. That is why I 
attach such great significance to the Jordanian awakening. 
  [Gazit] Do you really believe Jordan awakened of its own 
accord, that it was not affected by the green light it has 
reportedly received from al-Asad? 
  [Gur] It is my opinion that it was an independent Jordanian 
decision. I do not know how far-reaching their decision is, but 
it is definitely not the result of Syrian prodding. I hope it 
will mature and progress. If it affects Syria in a positive 
direction, it will be doubly welcome. For myself, I see it as a 
new line adopted by Jordan, which does not want to be left out 
of the process -- which could happen, what with the continuing 
implementation of the arrangement between us and the 
Palestinians. 
  [Eylon] What they do want, Mr. Gur, is 320 square km between 
the port of al-'Aqabah and the Dead Sea. 
  [Gur] I am very well acquainted with the disputed issues. 
All these issues can be settled. I can tell you in no 
uncertain terms that there is no reason why Israel and Jordan 
should not reach an understanding quite quickly for the benefit 
of both sides. As far as Israel is concerned, such an 
understanding is important for the future of the negotiations 
with the Palestinians too, because it opens up new, important, 
and very consequential options for the next phases of 
negotiations. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Aluf Ben and 'Aqiva Eldar] </F>
  [Excerpts] The United States is drafting its own proposal 
for an Israeli-Syrian peace arrangement, in an attempt to break 
the impasse in the peace negotiations between the two countries. 
Information recently obtained by senior officials in Jerusalem 
indicates that the U.S. peace team is now formulating the U.S. 
position on issues disputed by Jerusalem and Damascus, although 
the administration has not decided yet whether the U.S. 
intervention should start as soon as during Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher's upcoming shuttle tour scheduled for the end 
of June, or whether it would be preferable to wait till the end 
of the summer. 
  It was further revealed that yesterday, senior U.S. 
Administration officials told Israeli officials that Damascus 
had encouraged Jordan to launch normalization moves with Israel 
at once, in a bid to prepare the ground for Syrian advancement 
toward a peace agreement with Israel. [passage omitted] 
  Information reaching Jerusalem indicates that the emerging 
U.S. Administration proposal is based on the premise that Israel 
will withdraw from the entire Golan Heights; it focuses on 
detailed specifications of security arrangements, normalization 
steps, and arrangement implementation timetables. 
  The administration is currently weighing whether 
Christopher's upcoming tour is the right time to present the 
U.S. position. According to information received in Jerusalem, 
Dennis Ross favors immediate U.S. intervention, while the 
secretary of state prefers to let Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad "stew in their own juices" 
for two or three more months, until they either agree to 
relinquish their rigid stances or ask for U.S. intervention in 
the negotiations. 
  U.S. and Israeli sources are convinced that Syria is behind 
the positive change in Jordan's stand at the tripartite talks in 
Washington. They believe that President al-Asad does not want 
to launch rapprochement steps with Israel before Jordan, and his 
positive signals to Jordan gave rise to expectations for a 
crucial development in the upcoming meeting between President 
Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher.

  [Text] Muhammad Ibrahim, a 29-year-old Syrian citizen, was 
detained for 15 days on the orders of the 'Akko Magistrate's 
Court. The young man surrendered himself to Israel Defense 
Forces forces three days ago. 
  Our correspondent Yo'el Dar reports that the Syrian man is 
suspected of infiltrating Israel. He told the court that he 
fled Syria so as to receive medical treatment for scars left on 
his body by electric treatments he had been given by Syrian 
doctors. The judge ordered that the man be given a medical 
examination before a verdict is passed.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by </F>
Me'ir Einstein on 9 June; place not given -- live or recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Einstein] Mr. Prime Minister, 
we know the PLO has been trying to establish political facts in 
Jerusalem. What is the government doing about it? 
  [Rabin] We launched consultations on the Jerusalem situation 
two or three weeks ago, even before the public storm broke out. 
Organizations providing the Palestinian residents of the 
territories with services have been established over the years; 
some of them are fully justified. These include the Supreme 
Islamic Council, which is responsible for Temple Mount, a sacred 
site frequented by Palestinians from Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza. 
This council has been in charge of religious services since 
1967. There is the al-Maqasid Hospital, which has existed under 
different governments for many years, and which serves residents 
in and outside East Jerusalem. There are institutions in other 
fields devoid of any political significance. 
  We intend to explore the situation. As Israeli law applies 
to united Jerusalem, we may be forced to initiate special 
legislation to avert any PLO attempt to set up bodies of 
governing nature in Jerusalem. The PLO pledged that all 
Palestinian Authority bodies would be in Jericho during the 
interim period. We will insist on it even if special 
legislation is needed to ensure it. 
  [Einstein] What about Orient House activities? 
  [Rabin] If Mr. Faysal al-Husayni wants to be member of the 
Palestinian Authority, he will have to reside in Jericho. If he 
wishes to remain in Jerusalem, he will have to waive membership 
in the Palestinian Authority. 
  [Einstein] Does this mean we are going to close Orient 
House? 
  [Rabin] We will check the legal aspects. In fact, the 
attorney general has been doing it for about two weeks. A 
discussion on the issue was held in my office and a similar 
discussion was held at the Ministerial Committee on National 
Security Affairs. The discussions dealt with moves we should 
take to ensure that the agreement is adhered to and that all the 
governing authorities and their institutions be situated in 
Jericho, and not in Jerusalem during the interim period. 
  [Einstein] Thank you very much, Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin.

<F P=106> [Political correspondent Gadi Sukenik video report] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister Rabin this evening attacked both the 
Likud and 'Arafat on the East Jerusalem letter issue. He said 
that the PLO chairman was lying when he spoke about the issue in 
Johannesburg. Rabin told our correspondent Gadi Sukenik a short 
time ago that no attempt was made to conceal anything in the 
Jerusalem letter issue. Rabin says that 'Arafat's remarks 
constituted a fallacious attempt to create a link between the 
interim arrangement in the territories and East Jerusalem. 
Rabin added that whatever is taking place in Jerusalem at the 
present time is none of the PLO's concern. Rabin added that if 
Faysal al-Husayni resides in Jerusalem and occupies Orient House 
he will not be a member of the Palestinian Authority, because a 
total separation will be preserved between the autonomy areas 
and East Jerusalem: 
  [Begin Rabin recording] Wherein did 'Arafat lie? He said he 
received a letter from us, but no letter was addressed to him 
regarding Israel's policy in East Jerusalem during the interim 
arrangement period. Two, he said this issue was linked to the 
Gaza-Jericho First agreement. This issue was not raised in any 
form or shape in the negotiations we held with 'Arafat during my 
visit to Cairo. Three, 'Arafat tried -- with the Likud's help 
-- to link the letter sent to the Norwegian foreign minister 
explaining our policy -- as publicly described by the foreign 
minister in the Knesset -- to the Gaza-Jericho First agreement 
or to the interim arrangement. This is all a lie, and this is 
what Minister Shahal said. [end recording]

Peres for his letter to the Norwegian foreign minister regarding 
the Palestinian institutions in Jerusalem. Mr. Sharon told the 
Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that these 
institutions were established during the tenure of Yitzhaq

this issue in almost every government session and demanded a 
halt to Orient House activity, but most of the ministers used to 
react by bursting out in laughter.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "No Explanation"] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday the foreign minister raged and fumed, but 
failed to convince. The deeper he sank, the more his colleagues 
deserted him: Shahal denied responsibility, Aloni doubted the 
merit of his explanation, and the prime minister's bureau was 
conspicuously silent. The resulting -- and well-founded -- 
impression was that the publicized letter was not all there was. 
That there was more. And if that was not enough, a close 
perusal of the publicized text of the letter -- which was 
supposed to have been written by experienced diplomats -- made 
one wonder about its grave inconsistencies. 
  The government's credibility plummeted, and the Jerusalem 
issue acquired a more critical edge. How valid are the prime 
minister's pronouncements about "united Jerusalem, Israel's 
eternal capital," when the foreign minister refers to eastern 
Jerusalem (not even "East Jerusalem") as a distinct unit? 
  The angry Peres offered no convincing explanations, and 
certainly no solutions. The grave problems created by his 
letter, by 'Arafat's interpretation of the letter, and by the 
circumstances surrounding its nonpublication and publication can 
be at least partially attenuated by immediate, categorical 
action, such as a bill banning PLO political activities in 
Jerusalem and prohibiting the use of PLO emblems in the city. 
Yet time is the most crucial factor in this matter. They can 
do it with utmost speed, if they so wish.

  [Text] A public forum for Jerusalem was established 
yesterday in a meeting held in the office of Economy and 
Planning Minister Prof. Shim'on Shetrit in Jerusalem. The forum 
is composed of settlement leaders and Labor Knesset members 
[MK's]. It has been learned that the group drafted a platform 
for political action for Jerusalem and the Jerusalem precinct. 
  The forum was launched by the heads of the Jerusalem area 
local councils of Efrat, 'Etzyon Bloc, Giv'at Ze'ev, and Ma'ale 
Adumim. Besides Minister Shetrit, the forum includes Deputy 
Minister Masha Lubelsky and Labor MK's 'Imanu'el Zismann, Rafi 
Elul, Avigdor Qahalani, Gid'on Sagi, Ya'aqov Shefi, Yoram Lass, 
Ra'anan Kohen, Yosi Vanunu, Shlomo Buhbut, and Salih Tarif. 
  Other participants were Reserve Major General 'Uzi Narqis, 
Prof. Yehoshu'a Porat, Local Authority Center Chairman 'Adi 
Eldar, Prof. Yitzhaq Parnas, and the mayors of several cities, 
including Nazareth and Ashqelon. 
  The participants defined the forum's objective: building up 
settlements in the Jerusalem environs and creating territorial 
contiguity from Jerusalem to its surrounding towns and 
settlements. This is in view of the recent Palestinian 
pronouncements and attempts to make gains in Jerusalem during 
the interim period. 
  The forum demanded that the implementation of the 
construction plans in local councils around Jerusalem be 
expedited and additional construction plans be carried out in a 
bid to create a Jewish territorial contiguity in the Jerusalem 
district.

    [Editorial report] The HA'ARETZ supplement of Tel Aviv 
HA'ARETZ in Hebrew on 3 June carries a 5,000-word report by 
Mikhal Peleg on pages 36, 37, 38, and 40, on the issue of 
Jerusalem. 
  Peleg asserts that in the 27 years since East Jerusalem was 
conquered, "Israel has done all it could to make the city one -- 
and Jewish. Yet one united Jerusalem -- the only national 
consensus that survived the evils of conquest -- does not exist 
in reality. In real life, the capital is a patchwork of Jewish 
neighborhoods densely interspersed with enclaves of alienated 
Arab population surviving in dire conditions. The border which 
once separated the two parts of Jerusalem has disintegrated into 
dozens of border lines of an elusive yet very tangible nature, 
and they are never crossed. The alienation between the two 
populations has created a situation no Israeli Government ever 
intended; construction and development were invested in the 
judaization of Jerusalem, and the discrimination practiced 
against the city's Arab residents made them a separate entity. 
Now it is easy for the Palestinians to demand separation 
because separation is already there." 
  Peleg goes on: "The battle for Jerusalem did not end with 
military occupation. It has been going on since 1967 through 
vast investments in infrastructure and the expedited 
construction of Jewish neighborhoods over the entire annexed 
territory, even at the expense of irreversible damage to scenery 
and the city's special character. Today, East Jerusalem alone 
is inhabited by 160,000 Jews, versus about 155,000 Arabs. The 
takeover campaign is complemented by several steps: a 
wide-scale expropriation of Arab lands -- 26,200 dunam to date; 
systematic restrictions on Arab construction; and the deliberate 
disregard for basic services to the Palestinian population. 
Over the years, Jerusalem's Arab residents have opted for 
passive resistance, which was mainly reflected in the scant 
participation in municipal elections (6 percent after the 
outbreak of the intifadah in 1989, less than 10 percent in the 
last elections)." 
  Peleg states that Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert believes the 
unofficial separation between the two parts of Jerusalem is "a 
temporary situation. Olmert plans to invest in improvements in 
the Arab city, and he accuses Teddy Kollek of neglecting and 
totally ignoring the Arab population's needs. He says he needs 
140 million shekels of government funds to bring that part of 
the city up to date." 
  "Two cities exist side by side in Jerusalem: In one of them, 
new neighborhoods are built at a rate unparalleled in the entire 
State of Israel. Thousands of housing units are built and 
enormous investments are made in infrastructure, roads, 
landscape planning, street illumination, shopping malls, 
industrial and trade regions. Israel has built 60,000 housing 
units for Jews in areas annexed in 1967 alone, and 10,000 more 
are currently under construction. On the other side, there is 
another city, which can be hardly called a city. It is made up 
of isolated enclaves which look like dusty rural areas; one- or 
two-story houses, hardly any sidewalks, many unpaved roads, few 
street lights, most of which do not work, several streets 
sharing a single garbage collection receptacle, no playgrounds 
or parks." 
  "Jewish neighborhoods receive electricity from the Israeli 
Electrical Corporation. Arab neighborhoods receive theirs 
through the mediation of the East Jerusalem Electricity Company, 
a Jordanian-owned firm whose plants near Shu'fat were deserted 
when it was forced to stop producing power and made to buy it 
from the Israeli corporation. To reach West Jerusalem and the 
Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem, one uses Egged buses; 
the Palestinians have buses operated by small private companies 
from nearby villages, such as Abu-Dis and al-'Ayzariyah." 
  Peleg maintains that to facilitate Jewish construction in 
Jerusalem, the government has been expropriating and freezing 
Arab land. "In addition to the 73,000 dunam annexed in 1967," 
"26,200 dunam of privately owned Arab land were expropriated in 
1968, 1970, 1980, and 1990." To accommodate construction plans, 
another 2,300 dunam will be expropriated in the near future; 
tens of thousands of housing units for Jews were built on that 
land. That was how Gilo, Talpiyyot East, Neve Ya'aqov, Pisgat 
Ze'ev, and other neighborhoods sprouted. Another 35,000 dunam 
of unused Arab-owned land in East Jerusalem were frozen, that 
is, construction is prohibited on them. The Arabs have been left 
with a 9,500-dunam area on which they may build. 
  "A method of transferring lands to Jews was established 
under Teddy Kollek. The method consisted of marking map areas 
featuring privately owned Arab land in green. This was the sign 
allegedly indicating that the land was earmarked for public use 
and parks, and that construction was prohibited there. A few 
years after the land was marked green, some of it was 
expropriated and Jewish neighborhoods were built on them. For 
example, the Rekhes Shu'fat neighborhood, to be inhabited by 
Canadian ultra-Orthodox Jews, is in initial stages of 
construction, and planning has begun for two new neighborhoods, 
Har Homa and Sha'ar Mizrah between Neve Ya'aqov and the French 
Hill as well as a residential Jewish area in the heart of the 
Arab Ra's al-'Amud neighborhood." 
  Peleg adds that while "West Jerusalem has a master plan, all 
East Jerusalem has are local master plans which, for years, 
referred only to the Jewish neighborhoods. Only six Arab 
neighborhoods have received official license to date, while 
eight others have been waiting for approval for 10 years. In 
1980, a municipal committee submitted a plan which indicated a 
need for 18,000 additional housing units for the city's Arab 
population. Nothing of this materialized. The Arab population 
grew from 114,000 in 1980 to 155,500 today. On the basis of 
five persons to an apartment, about 26,000 housing units for 
Arabs should have been built in East Jerusalem. As a result of 
the shortage and the overcrowded conditions, 5,000 housing units 
were built -- many without a license. In 1990, for instance, 
3,000 building permits were issued; of these, only 150 were for 
Arabs. Former city council member Sara Kaminker, who had been 
Kollek's adviser on Arab neighborhoods until her protest 
resignation, has amassed information indicating that about 
21,000 Jerusalemite Arab families are homeless." 
  Peleg maintains that "the war over Jerusalem has changed 
after the Palestinians began, for the first time, to take action 
to improve their positions. Last November, a committee 
initiated by Faysal al-Husayni was set up. Its objective is to 
establish the National Council for Jerusalem-Palestine and to 
outline an action plan for the interim period. The committee, 
which is headed by Dr. Mahdi 'Abd-al-Hadi from PASSIA 
(Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International 
Affairs), has practically drafted a plan for every municipal 
council department, from construction planning and 
infrastructure down to services, such as education, health, 
culture and religion, public security, and tax collection, 
including a blueprint for a Palestinian police force in East 
Jerusalem. PASSIA holds workshops from which local leaders and 
professional teams are gradually emerging." "In other offices 
related to Orient House, such as the Palestinian Geographical 
Center, Israeli takeover of Arab lands is meticulously 
documented, and each change is immediately noticed. In 
addition, they draw maps for future negotiations." 
  Khalil Tufakji, the Palestinian Geographical Center 
director, 
"claims that Ehud Olmert is trying to continue the Jewish 
expansion eastward, to the area outside metropolitan Jerusalem's 
boundaries, through the Sha'ar Mizrah neighborhood due to be 
built beyond road No. 9, linking Ma'ale Adumim to Pisgat Ze'ev." 
  "Palestinians have a vested interest in launching the debate 
on Jerusalem before the two years stipulated in the agreement 
are out: Their argument is that by then, they may have no land 
to discuss. The Israeli Government is also aware of the fact 
that the mounting tensions in the city and the operation of its 
Palestinian institutions -- most notably Orient House, which 
even today is acting as a Palestinian municipal center and a 
quasi Foreign Ministry -- will force it to deal with the problem 
earlier than expected."

  [Text] The missing navigator Ron Arad has not been located 
in Iran. Iranian President 'Ali Hashemi-Rafsanjani said this in 
a news conference in Iran today. Rafsanjani emphasized that 
Iran has nothing to do with Ron Arad's fate. He also 
surprisingly declared Iran will not oppose the Middle East peace 
process in practice, despite its opposition in principle to any 
agreement with Israel. 
  A senior activist in the organization of Mustafa al-Dirani, 
who was abducted to Israel, said in Beirut today that Iran is 
actively aiding any organization hostile to Israel. 
  In reaction to Rafsanjani's comments, this evening, Israeli 
security sources said Israel continues to regard Iran and its 
satellites as responsible for Ron Arad's fate.

  [Text] Major General Uri Sagi, head of the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] Intelligence Branch, said today that he believes 
that the basic goals of the PLO and Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] will not change, although they are undergoing a 
pragmatic adaptation to the political reality. Our 
correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that Gen. Sagi made the remarks 
at the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. 
  Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu said he had obtained 
information from the defense establishment according to which 
the government intends to free 400 Hamas and Islamic Jihad 
activists, and inquired as to the impact this move would have on 
the security situation. Gen. Sagi said he cannot deny this 
information, adding that it is obvious that if those prisoners 
are released, some of them will engage in terror activity.

  [Text] Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq assesses that within one 
to one and a half years the political situation will clarify and 
we will know whether the region's leaders are ready to recognize 
Israel's security needs and reach normalization with it. If 
this does not happen, we will reach an impasse, according to the 
chief of staff. Lieutenant General Baraq also said that even if 
full peace and security arrangements are achieved, Israel will 
still need to preserve its military power and superiority for 
many years to come in the 21st century. He also said that 
terrorism will accompany us for a long time to come, and that we 
must also prepare to confront nonconventional dangers emanating 
from Iraq, Iran, and Libya. Our correspondent Haviva Roger 
reports that the chief of staff was addressing Haifa Technion 
graduates.

will positively recommend to his president Israel Aircraft 
Industries products, particularly Kfir planes. At the end of 
his visit he called on Israeli high-tech firms to establish 
production and marketing systems in the Philippines that could 
serve as a basis for all Southeast Asia. Romulo also said his 
country would be glad to help Israel in promoting relations with 
Muslim states in the area, whom he believed would establish full 
ties with Israel as the peace process advanced.

  [Text] Minister Shulamit Aloni has said that the Labor 
party is disintegrating and the functioning of all its bodies 
has been disrupted. Every wheeler-dealer wants to be a Knesset 
member and there is unbridled competition between hawks and 
doves, she said. Aloni cautioned that this disintegration might 
lead to the collapse of the peace process and to a war in which 
Egypt would also take part. According to her, Meretz must make 
the government's basic guidelines more pronounced and make sure 
that it abides by its commitments. 
  In response, Labor Secretary General Nisim Zvili told our 
party affairs correspondent Shmu'el Tal that Meretz's peace is 
not Labor's peace. He noted that Labor had been dealt a blow, 
but is currently recovering and not disintegrating.

<F P=106> [Report by On Levi] </F>
  [Text] Without an additional allocation of 300 million 
shekels, it will be impossible to complete the Gaza Strip 
fencing work. Senior defense establishment officials said this 
yesterday in a special meeting held in the defense minister's 
bureau attended by the prime minister and finance minister. 
According to the security officials, the lack of funds prevents 
progress in the work and approval for the additional funds is 
essential now. The discussion was not completed yesterday; 
treasury officials are slated to give their reply early next 
week. 
  In a special session convened in Rabin's bureau in Tel Aviv, 
the heads of the defense establishment -- Chief of Staff Baraq, 
Defense Ministry Director General David 'Ivri, and Brigadier 
General Mikha'el Navon, the chief of staff's financial adviser 
-- presented their additional budgetary requests to Finance 
Minister Shohat, Budget Department head David Brodet, and 
Accountant-General Re'uven Kokolevich. Senior defense 
establishment sources say the sum required is approximately 300 
million shekels, stemming from the high costs of Operation 
Rainbow -- the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] redeployment plan in 
Gaza and Jericho. So far, the defense establishment has 
received an additional allocation of 200 million shekels, based 
on the understanding that there will be no more financial 
requests for the redeployment. The costs of Operation Rainbow, 
however, have grown immensely, and now an additional 300 million 
shekels are necessary for financing additional portions of the 
fence surrounding the Qatif Bloc settlements and the fence 
surrounding the Gaza Strip. 
  The participants did not enter details concerning the 
additional budget required, but rather presented it in general 
terms. Rabin and Shohat agreed that joint Defense Ministry and 
Finance Ministry teams review the defense establishment's 
request over the next few days and will submit their conclusions 
early next week.

in turn sold the weapons to fugitives from Nabulus, Bayt Lahiyah 
in the Gaza Strip, and Tulkarm.

  [Text] With regard to the reasons that necessitated a 
cabinet reshuffle, Information Minister Dr. Jawad a-'Anani has 
said: 
  [Begin al-'Anani recording] We all know that His Majesty 
King Husayn is eager to have strong cooperation between the 
legislative and executive authorities. In order to promote the 
Jordanian economy and upgrade the level of its performance and 
achievement, and also to work out the appropriate legislation 
required by the coming phase, stronger cooperation between the 
legislative and executive authorities must be effected. This 
explains the primary reason for the cabinet reshuffle and the 
nature of this reshuffle. 
  Moreover, we know that the entire region will witness 
developments that have begun to surface as a result of the peace 
process and the events taking place in the region. In fact, 
this will basically make Jordan the focus of attention. Jordan 
will have a clear and effective role in these events. This 
requires us to pool, unify, and concentrate all our resources 
and direct them toward continuously making Jordan a strong and 
impregnable country under its Hashemite leadership. In brief, 
these are the most important reasons for the cabinet reshuffle.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam </F>
al-Majali, in Amman, by Antoine 'Awn, in London; date not given 
-- recorded] 
  [Text] ['Awn] In Amman, Jordanian Prime Minister 
'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali today announced a major reshuffle of his 
cabinet, bringing in 18 ministers, including 10 
parliamentarians. This move comes hours after Amman and Israel 
reached an agreement in Washington to define future trade and 
economic relations between the two countries, as our 
correspondent 'Aziz Fahmi reports. To clarify the reasons for 
this cabinet reshuffle, we contacted the Jordanian prime 
minister and asked him about the significance of the timing of 
the reshuffle and its connection with the Washington agreement. 
  [Al-Majali] I do not think it has any connection with that. 
The real significance is that we feel that the entire region is 
passing through a very delicate situation regarding the 
possibility of the existence of a new regional order and the 
much talked about Middle East market. Therefore, the executive 
and legislative authorities must cooperate and the whole nation 
must take a common stance. 
  ['Awn] Mr. Prime Minister, Syria has maintained that the 
Jordanian-Israeli agreement is a violation of the principle of 
comprehensive peace. Is it really? 
  [Al-Majali] Sir, first we do not think that Syria feels like 
that. We and Syria are in full agreement. We have always 
maintained each of the four tracks has its own peculiar 
character, and therefore the acceleration on any of the tracks 
is natural. We are fully committed to a comprehensive solution 
on all fronts, including, of course, the Syrian Golan Heights. 
This is a basic principle of our policy. We believe in a 
comprehensive solution. But the speed of movement on any track 
is good for the other tracks and not harmful to them. 
  ['Awn] You were quoted as saying in a parliamentary session 
that the Syrians have reached an agreement with the Israelis on 
the principle of withdrawal from the Golan. On what did you 
base your statement? 
  [Al-Majali] The statement was based on remarks made here and 
there, particularly the statements made by the American sponsor, 
his repeated visits, and the possibility of another visit. All 
these indicate that there is a possibility of progress on the 
Syrian-Israeli track. We hope it will happen, we strive for 
it, and we desire it because we think it is good for all of us: 
for Syria and for us.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam </F>
al-Majali, in Amman, by Ashraf 'Abd-al-'Aziz, in Cairo; date not 
given; from the "Dialogue From Afar" program -- recorded] 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] First, let us shed light on the new cabinet 
reshuffle in Jordan. 
  [Al-Majali] When it was first formed, this government, which 
I had the honor of leading, began a new experiment, what we call 
separation of executive and legislative powers, and no one from 
the House of Representatives took part in it. The experiment 
was very good. The non-presence of a deputy in that government 
or in any government should not be interpreted as preventing 
deputies from being ministers. This is totally wrong. There is 
a large number of deputies who have the capability of performing 
successful ministerial work. 
  Under the new reshuffle, 10 new deputies from various 
parliamentary blocs and various provinces in Jordan joined the 
cabinet. Eight new members also entered the cabinet so this is 
a cabinet reshuffle, not reformation. 
  We always believe in a measure like in the military; a group 
or platoon is in the trenches and is replaced by another group 
and the process is repeated. We have a good rotation process 
and most times it bears fruit. Of course, it has some negative 
aspects, but it also has good, positive aspects. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] But surely you have a specific view of a new 
phase that Jordan will witness in light of this new cabinet 
reshuffle. 
  [Al-Majali] As you know, the entire region is experiencing a 
delicate phase covering a regional order and the so-called 
Middle Eastern market. Al these issues are delicate and require 
very close cooperation between the executive and legislative 
authorities and require the whole country to stand together and 
envisage a good future for the state. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Moving from the cabinet reshuffle to the 
peace talks, there is a Jordanian-Israeli negotiations committee 
holding its sessions in Washington to discuss the border and 
participation in water resources. Let us learn about Jordan's 
view put forth by that committee. 
  [Al-Majali] As you know, Jordan signed an agenda with Israel 
on 14 September last year and the agenda is clear, especially in 
the bases on which it relied. Of course, the basic topics of 
that agenda include the withdrawal from the Jordanian 
territories, our right to water, and the issue of refugees and 
the displaced, in addition to various other topics. It was 
agreed to list these issues in an agenda to enable us to 
negotiate on them and the bilateral talks assumed this task. 
Even in the negotiations on the four tracks, the Arab brothers 
agreed that each track has its own characteristics and thus its 
progress should be different but what is important is that all 
tracks should make the final line. 
  Before the negotiations stopped because of the Hebron 
incident, there was an agreement to form a tripartite 
U.S.-Jordanian-Israeli committee to discuss a host of issues, 
including those listed on the agenda. We received information 
that Israel is now ready to form a joint committee to demarcate 
the border correctly prior to withdrawal from the Jordanian 
territories and committees to discuss legitimate shares of 
water. These two basic points have always been on the agenda 
but we were unable to initiate their discussion seriously. 
Through the tripartite committee we are now able to do that and 
hence came the meetings in Washington to emphasize these points 
and put the agreement into a mechanism [last word in English]. 
According to the agenda, the two sides should agree on a 
mechanism and phases for the negotiations to proceed on each 
topic. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Israeli suggests that a new road linking 
'Aqabah and Elat be opened. What is Jordan's stand on this 
proposal? 
  [Al-Majali] There are many points on the agenda that 
stipulates that all parties should cooperate in projects in the 
region that are beneficial to all sides concerned. These 
projects include, for example, a canal between the Red Sea and 
the Dead Sea and a road linking Egypt and Jordan via Elat. 
These are projects for the future and the discussion now is on 
whether they can or cannot be examined. There is an agreement to 
study these projects. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Moving on to Arab issues, what preoccupies 
the Arab arena is the current situation in Yemen. What is 
Jordan's view on what is happening in Yemen? 
  [Al-Majali] Jordan's stand is firm and has not changed since 
the problem began when the president and vice president asked 
His Majesty King Husayn to help them resolve the issue between 
them. A dialogue committee was formed, the Amman accord was 
concluded, and what happened afterward is known. 
  We believe in unity. We have an absolute faith in unity and 
do not believe in separation because a separation that takes 
place in Yemen might take place in any other Arab country. We 
are against this. We are not against the south at all but 
against the idea of separation. We support unity and oppose 
infighting no matter what the reason.

<F P=106> [Report by a staff correspondent with agency dispatches] </F>
  [Excerpt] Jordan on Wednesday [8 June] described as highly 
important and significant the agreement the Kingdom reached with 
Israel to start negotiations on demarcating their borders and 
water sharing, issues the Jewish state has been avoiding since 
the begining of the Arab-Israeli peace process in September 1991. 
  Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani said: "We have affirmed 
one basic principle: The ceasefire lines will change to 
international and recognised borders, which stress the unity of 
Jordanian territories, preempt any designs on them and preserve 
the Jordanian entity." 
  He said the two sides had based their agreement on two main 
points: That the British mandate coordinates will be the 
reference for defining the border and that the borders will be 
delineated on the ground. 
  Dr. al-'Anani was talking to reporters after two days of 
Jordanian-Israeli talks in Washington under the auspices of a 
trilateral commission which also includes the United States 
produced the agreements. 
  The information minister said another major breakthrough was 
an agreement to work out a fair division of the waters of the 
Jordan and Yarmuk rivers now being exploited by Israel at the 
expense of Jordan. Regional and international conventions will 
be the basis for determining the share of each side, he said. 
  "We also agreed to look at the Jordan Valley project as a 
comprehensive project to discuss the development of its 
infrastructure and to develop large projects which will be 
discussed for the future," he said. 
  "We agreed to conduct a number of studies that will pave the 
way to establish large development projects in the area," Dr. 
al-'Anani said. 
  In this context the major project is a desalination project 
linked to a Jordanian-proposed canal connecting the Red Sea to 
the Dead Sea and this proposal will be studied closely, Dr. 
al-'Anani said. 
  The minister said a Jordanian agreement to accept the 
presentation of an American paper on the Jordan Valley did not 
mean that the Kingdom was dropping its reservations over 
launching such projects before the border and water issues are 
settled. "In the framework of studies at the present time, we 
cannot think of such projects except after reaching an agreement 
on the border issue," Dr. al-'Anani said. 
  Regarding the economic issues, especially in light of the 
agreement reached between the Palestine Liberation Organisation 
(PLO) in April on banks and trade, the Jordanian side clarified 
the implications of such an agreement on the Jordanian economy, 
because it limits, to a certain degree, Jordan's freedom of 
exporting its goods to the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Dr. 
al-'Anani said. 
  The Israeli side agreed to the expansion of Jordanian 
exports 
to the Palestinian territories and also agreed that if there 
were any proposals in the future to issue a Palestinian 
currency, Jordan would be notified before hand to give it 
sufficient time to take measures to protect its currency. 
  "It also became clear that there were issues to be discussed 
trilaterally: A proposal was made calling for a 
Jordanian-Israeli- Palestinian economic committee to discuss 
some of the issues in order to develop it and to finalise it in 
a proper way," Dr. al-'Anani said. 
  "In my opinion, these are very important results for Jordan 
because it achieves and contributes to asserting the geographic 
and demographic unity of Jordan," the minister told reporters. 
  The delegates from Israel and Jordan signed three documents 
setting out a detailed agenda for further talks. 
  The first text concerns water, energy and the environment, 
the second addresses security and the third concerns the border 
and other territorial issues. 
  The security text pledges that Israel and Jordan will draw 
up 
security arrangements and discuss confidence measures between 
the two sides. 
  The two countries decided to begin negotiations on their 
border dispute in July, together with talks on development 
projects. 
  The final border decision must refer to the boundary drawn 
up 
in 1922 by Britain, which then held the Palestine mandate, when 
it set the borders for Transjordan. 
  Jordan hopes to regain a strip of about 360 square 
kilometres 
from the Gulf of Aqaba to the Dead Sea, as well as two square 
kilometres south of Lake Tiberias in the Jordan valley. [passage

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Restoring Territorial and Water Rights First"] </F>
  [Text] Undoubtedly, Jordan is extremely eager to render the 
peace process a success on all tracks to help achieve just and 
comprehensive peace. 
  Nonetheless, Jordan will not accept any peace. For the peace 
that Jordan is striving to achieve is the peace that would 
return all rights, be they territorial or otherwise, to their 
lawful owners. While negotiating with Israel within the context 
of the tripartite economic committee, which also includes the 
United States, Jordan will not accept to embark on economic 
coordination with Israel before the latter gives it back its 
territories, before its borders with Israel are demarcated, and 
before its usurped water rights are restored. 
  As His Majesty King Husayn has repeatedly said, Jordan will 
not abandon a single iota of its territorial or water rights. 
In the same vein, Jordan will not conclude a separate peace 
agreement with Israel. 
  This firm Jordanian position is widely known to Israel, the 
U.S. Administration, and the fraternal cordon states. 
  Consequently, when it insists on economic or noneconomic 
coordination with Jordan before the latter restores its 
territorial and water rights, and before all issues that need to 
be addressed are resolved, Israel spikes the peace process and 
shows a desire to thwart the negotiations. 
  If Israel actually seeks economic coordination with Jordan, 
or any other Arab party for that matter, it must recognize the 
legitimate rights of the Arab sides, and subscribe to the 
relevant international legitimacy resolutions and the principle 
of trading land for peace, as well. 
  It must comply with UN Resolutions 242, 338, and 425, and 
express a willingness to withdraw from the occupied Jordanian 
territories, the Golan, and southern Lebanon. This must precede 
any talk of economic or noneconomic cooperation with this or 
that Arab country. But when it persists with its ground, sea, 
and air attacks on fraternal Lebanon, destroys its cities and 
villages, and damages the houses of Lebanese citizens, Israel 
creates insurmountable difficulties in the path of peace and 
pushes for a military escalation in the region--a development 
that could paralyze the peace process and demolish its very 
foundations.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Isam Qadamani] </F>
  [Text] Minister of Communications Dr. Tariq al-Suhaymat 
has reiterated Jordan's willingness to fully cooperate and 
coordinate with the Palestinian National Authority [PNA] in the 
areas of post and communications. 
  In statements to AL-RA'Y, the minister added that Jordan's 
Ministry of Communications has supplied the PNA with a copy of 
the Ministry's structural organization, as well as job 
descriptions of the Ministry's components, sections, and 
institutions at the request of PNA Minister of Post and 
Communications 'Abd-al-Hafiz al-Ashhab, who held talks with 
several Ministry officials in this regard. Al-Ashhab also 
obtained details about the Jordanian telephone system. 
  Dr. al-Suhaymat added that the Palestinian side requested to 
benefit from the Jordanian expertise so that Palestinian cadres 
may learn from them. He noted that Jordan will provide the 
Palestinian self-rule authority with experts, technicians, and 
engineers in the field of postal services and communications. 
Additionally, Jordan will provide training to several PNA 
employees working in this field at Jordanian institutions. 
  Al-Suhaymat indicated that the talks with al-Ashhab also 
touched on effecting a direct telephonic linkage between the 
Jordanian telephone network and the network expected to be 
established in Gaza and Jericho. He asserted Jordan's readiness 
to implement this linkage once the PNA requests this. 
  When queried further on the issue, Dr. al-Suhaymat said that 
Jordan will effect a direct telephonic linkage with the 
Palestinian side only in Gaza and Jericho at present, and in the 
West Bank later. He noted that there will not be any kind of 
telephonic linkages with or through Israel pending the outcome 
of the peace talks. He added: "It is premature to speak of a 
linkage with Israel at present." 
  Dr. al-Suhaymat indicated that Jordan has officially and 
repeatedly urged the world states not to relay telephone calls 
from Israel to Jordan. 
  With respect to cooperation in the field of postal services, 
the minister of communications said that Jordan, in talks with 
the Palestinians, has expressed its full readiness to transport 
the mail coming from various parts of the world to the 
autonomous areas via the King Husayn Bridge and vice versa in 
accordance with the norms and methods currently in force. 
  Dr. al-Suhaymat added that the Palestinian self-rule 
authority must obtain an international telephonic code for its 
communications so that it may gain complete independence from 
Israel in this regard. He went on to say that this would be 
less costly than using the Israeli network. 
  The minister indicated that Jordan will witness great 
developments in the field of communications once peace is 
achieved. He added that the Communications Corporation is making 
enormous efforts to implement its projects over the next few 
months to prepare for the start of the 21st century.

  [Text] Amman (J.T.)--The government's decision to raise by 
10 percent the basic salaries of civil servants aims at 
improving the living conditions of government employees and 
giving them incentive towards better and more productive work, 
Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali said Sunday. 
  Speaking at a meeting held at the Central Bank of Jordan 
(CBJ), Dr. al-Majali said the government was also seeking reform 
in its public administration system and improve the performance 
of employees. 
  Dr. al-Majali's statement came less than 24 hours after the 
government's announcement that the 437,000 serving government 
workers, military personnel and pensioners will get a raise of 
10 percent that would not be less than JD [Jordanian dinars] 10 
per month. The increase takes effect on July 1, 1994. 
  Finance Minister Sami Qammuh said the decision was taken to 
give the civil servants a raise "within the government's 
financial means." But, he added, a special committee of experts 
is continuing to study other measures intended to improve 
government employees' conditions and raise their efficiency and 
performance. 
  Mr. Qammuh told a press conference on Sunday that the 
government hoped the committee would end its study and submit 
recommendations to the govenrment in the next few months. 
  Another committee had been entrusted with studying matters 
related to state-owned lands on which govenrment housing units 
could be set up to benefit government employees, he said. This 
committee would be given long-term soft loans provided by the 
state, the minister said. 
  Mr. Qammuh said that while the 10 percent increase benefits 
government civil and military personnel and the pensioners, 
employees excelling in their performance would be granted other 
allowances depending on the degree of their progress and their 
production. 
  Mr. Qammuh said the economy was moving ahead "with firm 
strides towards further growth and stability." 
  Economic indicators in the first few months of this year 
point to continuing economic growth in various sectors of 
production and service despite the "wait-and-see situation in 
view of the prevailing circumstances in the region," Mr. Qammuh 
said. 
  "We hope to see all Jordan's economic objectives achieved 
with the completion of the economic restructuring programme 
agreed on with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)," the 
minister said, adding that the accomplishments of the past two 
years had exceeded expectations. 
  Mr. Qammuh said that exports rose from JD 213 million in the 
first four months of 1993 to JD 292 million in the first quarter 
of this year and imports declined from JD 697 million in the 
first four months of 1993 to JD 644 million in the same period 
of 1994. 
  The deficit in the fiscal budget has narrowed from JD 69 
million to JD 21.7 million in the first four months of this 
year, largely due to a decline in expenditure and a rise in 
revenues, the minister said. 
  Mr. Qammuh said that an upsurge in the construction business 
provides another indicator of the improvement of the general 
economic situation. 
  In the first four months of last year 2,889 building 
licences 
were issued against 4,232 in the same period of this year while 
the area built during this period this year amounted to nearly a 
million square metres, up from 635,000 square metres in the same 
period of last year, the minister said. 
  Mr. Qammuh noted that intial issues in Amman Financial 
Market 
(AFM) in the first four months of 1994 amounted to JD 79.2 
million compared to JD 48.1 million in the same period of 1993. 
  Mr. Qammuh said the government expects Jordan to achieve a 
5.5 percent growth at current fixed prices in the gross domestic 
product (GDP). Inflation, he said, is expected at five percent. 
A reduction in the fiscal budget by 6.4 percent over the 1993 
figures is also expected. 
  A reduction in the budget deficit from 6.4 percent of the 
gross domestic product in 1993 to 5.4 percent this year is also 
expected, Mr. Qammuh said. 
  The government expects a reduction of the deficit in the 
current balance of payments from JD 648 million in 1993 to JD 
546 million this year, he said.

<F P=106> [By P.V. Vivekanand] </F>
  [Text] Amman--The Jordanian economy performed well in the 
first five months of 1994 and could be expected to register a 
growth between five and six percent during the year, Central 
Bank of Jordan (CBJ) Governor Muhammad al-Nabulsi said Tuesday. 
  Briefing the local media in an informal meeting at the CBJ, 
the governor also said the Kingdom had to adopt more 
rationalisation and belt-tightening measures with a view to 
gaining optimum benefit from the utilisation of resources. 
  Dr. al-Nabulsi cited as examples the amount the government 
spends on higher education with little direct returns and the 
indirect subsidies offered to consumers in the water and energy 
sector and said revenue collection should also be improved. 
  Exports improved by 20 percent and imports showed a 15 
percent decline in the first quarter of this year when compared 
with the corresponding period in 1993, but the trend could 
change during the rest of the year, Dr. al-Nabulsi said. He 
expected inflation to remain under five percent. 
  Some sectors of the economy did show stagnation, but other 
sectors performed better than expected to make up for the 
shortfall and project an overall growth, he said. 
  The nature of investments is in "the right direction" and 
expatriate remittances have also improved, the CBJ governor said. 
  Jordan hopes to open debt rescheduling talks with the Paris 
Club of creditor governments later this month on repayments 
maturing until the date of an agreement, he said, adding that 
the amount covered would be in the region of $420 million 
including principle and interest. 
  The Kingdom would also be seeking to reschedule dues to the 
Paris Club maturing in another 18 months--until the end of 1995. 
  He estimated that the Kingdom would have to pay around $400 
million for streamlining the expected agreement with Paris Club. 
  Jordan has scored impressive success by implementing the 
economic restructuring and recovery programme agreed with the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF), but there are shortcomings in 
adopting corrective measures in the water and energy sector, Dr. 
al-Nabulsi said, noting that the water and electricity tariffs 
did not actually reflect the cost of production and distribution. 
  Jordan is expected to receive $180 million in assistance 
from 
the IMF and World Bank in three years to help its balance of 
payments, and the Kingdom has already received the first tranche 
of $14 million, he said. However, the delays in implementing 
the corrective measures were also delaying further payments. 
  "It is not simply a matter of consumption," he said. "We 
have to adopt major measures in the water and energy sectors in 
terms of realistic tariffs." 
  In the banking sector, the CBJ was switching to "indirect 
controls" rather than direct measures such as ceilings on credit 
facilities and restrictions on the activities of commercial 
banks. The objective, Dr. al-Nabulsi said, is to influence the 
policies and decisions of commercial banks in a manner that 
would serve the economy and ensure the best utilisation of 
available resources. 
  So far this year, commercial banks have remained within the 
indirect limitations of credit facilities that the CBJ is forced 
to adopt as recommended by the IMF. It was the first time in 
several years that the limits were respected and adhered to, 
avoiding problems for the authorities to regulate the situation. 
  Developed countries use securities and bonds as a tool to 
control excess liquidity and inflation, Dr. al-Nabulsi pointed 
out, adding that Jordan adopted the certificates of deposit 
system eight months before it was supposed to have started it 
under the IMF programme. 
  The relative slump in the Amman Financial Market (AFM) 
cannot be taken as an indicator of the economy's performance 
since individuals and institutions motivated by speculative 
interests are the main players in the bourse, Dr. al-Nabulsi 
noted, adding that the stock market cannot be seen as a 
productive sector contributing to national growth. 
  The CBJ had no direct role to play in the AFM except perhaps 
controlling the involvement of commercial banks and financial 
institutions in portfolios. 
  At the same time, Dr. al-Nabulsi noted that the decline at 
the AFM was around four to five percent since the beginning of 
the year and described it as insignificant compared with the 30 
percent drop posted in the Tel Aviv exchange and the general 
recession in other stock markets around the world. 
  The CBJ will continue to maintain restrictions on transfers 
in order to prevent capital flight, but does not plan any 
additional regulations, the governor said. Such regulations 
only apply to residents, he added. 
  Jordan is prepared to face any eventuality resulting from 
possible negative economic and monetary measures adopted by the 
Palestinian self-rule authority, including the possible issuance 
of a Palestinian currency, he said. 
  The logic in the situation is that any such measure will 
affect both Jordanians and Palestinians on both sides of the 
river, and, as such, it is unlikely that Jordan would face any 
serious problems, whether in terms of capital flight or even the 
possible dumping of the Jordanian dinar, Dr. al-Nabulsi said. 
  "It is not a zero-sum game," where one will lose everything 
to the benefit of the other, he said, noting that a majority of 
the Palestinians in the occupied territories maintain their 
savings in the Jordanian dinar. 
  Dr. al-Nabulsi noted that Jordanian commercial banks have 
started operating in the occupied lands after a 27-year hiatus 
and this offers the CBJ direct monitoring of the situation there. 
  Commercial institutions may transfer Jordanian money to the 
occupied territories as economic development of the area picks 
up momentum, but the presence of the Jordanian banks is the best 
means for the CBJ to exercise its options to defend the 
Kingdom's monetary system, he added. 
  In any event, "we are well prepared to deal with any 
eventuality," he said. 
  The CBJ governor said between JD 350 and JD 400 million 
remain in circulation in he occupied territories. 
  There are many solutions to the issue and the best is an 
integration of the Jordanian and Palestinian currencies as and 
when the Palestinians issue their own tender, Dr. al-Nabulsi 
said. 
  In the meantime, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) 
has agreed that the self-rule authority in the occupied 
territories would use the dinar in all their internal official 
dealings, including salaries and taxes, he said.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz affirmed to the 
editors' doyen, Milhim Karam, that Lebanon refuses to equate 
resistance operations and the occupier's acts of aggression. He 
noted that resistance leaders' maturity and wisdom have foiled 
the Israeli attempt to strike at the internal front. 
  Buwayz voiced his hope that U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher will come to the area with clear and new proposals.

  [Text] Ba'labakk, Lebanon, June 9 (AFP) -- Pro-Iranian 
Hizballah guerrillas released six Lebanese men and a retired 
Syrian soldier hours after kidnapping them in Syrian-controlled 
eastern Lebanon, Syrian military officials said Thursday [9 
June]. They were freed overnight Wednesday after the Syrian 
military command in the al-Biqa' Valley threatened to arrest 
Hizballah militants in retaliation, the officials said. 
  The men were seized in the Ba'labakk region after three of 
them were seen taking photographs outside the home of 
Hizballah's former secretary general Shaykh Subhi al-Tufayli. 
Two of the men were identified as Lebanese expatriates who had 
returned to their home villages after long stays in the Gulf 
state of Qatar and the United States. 
  Security sources said the seven could have been taken in a 
Hizballah sweep to investigate the kidnapping on May 21 of 
pro-Iranian guerrilla leader Mustafa al-Dirani who was seized 
from his home in a raid by Israeli commandos. Moslem 
fundamentalist leaders have charged that the commandos were 
assisted by local accomplices. Hizballah has been on alert 
since June 2 when Israeli warplanes killed 32 guerrilla trainees 
on a base near Ba'labakk. 
  Israel hopes al-Dirani can supply vital information on 
missing Israeli airman Ron Arad shot down in south Lebanon in 
1986.

    [Editorial report] Beirut AL-'AHD in Arabic devotes most of 
its 27 May 1994 edition to reactions to the abduction of Mustafa 
al-Dirani, a leader of the Believers Resistance, by a "Zionist" 
commando unit. On pages 2, 3, and 17 the paper publishes 
approximately 3,500 words of remarks by Hizballah Secretary 
General Hasan Nasrallah at a news conference held on 24 May to 
lash out at the kidnapping operation. 
  On page 5 the paper publishes an approximately 550-word 
report on a statement issued by the Bloc of Loyalty to the 
Resistance [Hizballah's parliamentary group] condemning the 
kidnapping of al-Hajj Mustafa al-Dirani, "a symbol of the 
Believers Resistance." The statement says: "This cowardly 
operation was a blatant defiance and an impudent provocation 
against the resisting Lebanon. It also clearly reveals the 
policy of indifference being pursued by the authority regarding 
the country's primary issues, foremost being the political and 
military confrontation of the Zionist designs of hegemony." 
  On the same page, the paper publishes an approximately 
250-word report on an address delivered by scholar Ibrahim Amin 
al-Sayyid, chairman of the Bloc of Loyalty to the Resistance, 
during a memorial service. Having accused the state of inaction 
on the abduction of al-Dirani, al-Sayyid says: "The Lebanese 
people are no longer living under the protection of a state 
because it is incapable of achieving security and safeguarding 
the people's dignity." 
  On page 6, AL-'AHD publishes an approximately 3,000-word 
text 
of a statement issued by representatives of the Lebanese and 
Palestinian nationalist and Islamic parties and forces at the 
end of their meeting held at the invitation of the Believers 
Resistance to discuss the Israeli "act of piracy" in kidnapping 
al-Hajj Mustafa al-Dirani, a leader of the Believers Resistance; 
the date of the meeting was not given. Among those attending 
the meeting was Hizballah Political Bureau Chairman al-Hajj 
Husayn al-Khalil and representatives of "the Socialist Arab 
Ba'th Party, the Progressive Socialist Party, the Syrian Social 
Nationalist Party, the Socialist Labor Party, the Nasirite 
Popular Organization, the Union Party, the Islamic Amal 
Movement, the Congress Party, Fatah Movement--the Revolutionary 
Council, the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine, the Popular 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, the 
Islamic al-Da'wah Party in Iraq, the Islamic Group, the Islamic 
Resistance Movement--Hamas, the detainees follow-up committee, 
the Muslim Ulema Council, the Jabal 'Amil Ulema Committee, the 
secular conference, and the Democratic Front for the Liberation 
of Palestine." The conferees issued a statement, which says in 
part: "The participants demand that the Lebanese Government 
adopt a stance commensurate with the popular position expressed 
by the conferees to withdraw from the settlement negotiations, 
which continue to represent a cover for ceaseless Zionist crimes 
and attacks." The statement adds that "the conferees stress the 
need for the authority to adopt the option of resistance in the 
face of the enemy's plans and to support our resisting people in 
all fields and domains for the sake of liberating the land and 
safeguarding the holy places." 
  On page 7 AL-'AHD publishes approximately 1,000 words of 
statements by various Lebanese officials and deputies in 
reaction to the kidnapping operation. His Eminence Shaykh 
Zuhayr Kanj, member of the Muslim Ulema Council, "notes that the 
timing of the operation, just five days after Warren 
Christopher's visit to the region, indicates the State 
Department's involvement in the operation." He blames the local 
authority and the Lebanese Government for negligence toward "the 
act of piracy." Kanj calls on the prime minister to "resign 
immediately because he is no longer capable to run the country 
and because his policies have proved futile." 
  On page 9 the paper publishes an approximately 700-word 
interview with Deputy al-Hajj Muhammad Yaghi, member of the Bloc 
of Loyalty to the Resistance, place and date not given. He 
condemns the kidnapping of al-Hajj al-Dirani and says: "We must 
tell the Lebanese authorities that after the Zionist act of 
piracy that dereliction and negligence on the part of the 
government toward the basic issues, including the confrontation 
of the Zionist enemy's schemes and plots, are unacceptable 
policies for which the government must be held accountable." 
Yaghi adds: "It is useless to lodge a complaint with the 
Security Council as long as the U.S. Administration is the 
international power broker and also the unrepentent supporter of 
Zionist terrorism." He adds: "The only useful recourse is to 
support the resistance with every available means because 
resistance is the only appropriate reply to the continuing 
aggression and arrogance." 
  On the same page, AL-'AHD publishes an approximately 
2,000-word political and security analysis by Ibrahim 
Shams-al-Din of the kidnapping operation. The writer refutes 
the Israeli objectives and excuses behind the kidnapping 
operation, noting that the kidnapping will not give Israel any 
information about the whereabouts of Israeli navigator Ron Arad, 
simply because al-Dirani knows nothing about the Israeli pilot. 
The writer then discusses the "principles that should be upheld 
by the government to eliminate the loopholes that contributed 
toward the success of the terrorist operation." Shams-al-Din 
adds: "It is necessary that the government change the list of 
its priorities and give precedence to the issue of liberation. 
The government should close the gaps through which the Zionists 
penetrate the homeland's security and sovereignty." 
Shams-al-Din goes adds that "the Lebanese authority should take 
sufficient interest in the cause of the Lebanese detainees held 
in Israeli prisons. The government should investigate the 
recent kidnapping operation and unveil the identity of the 
collaborators, who, according to various stories, guided the 
enemy forces to the landing spot and to roads leading to the 
house of al-Dirani."

  [Text] Cairo, 9 Jun (MENA) -- Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr 
al-'Attas, who has been appointed prime minister in south Yemen, 
has warned that the persistence of the crisis will lead to major 
escalation and produce gloomy regional repercussions, including 
possible internationalization of the crisis. 
  In an interview with the newspaper AL-AHRAM published today, 
al-'Attas said: We are now limiting our efforts on reaching a 
cease-fire and agreeing on a formula for future conditions in 
the country. If Sanaa insists, however, on maintaining the 
crisis, the future will be bleak. 
  Al-'Attas praised Egypt's historic support for Yemeni 
interests since the 1970's up until the breakout of the recent 
ferocious civil war that Egypt, under the leadership of 
President Mubarak, is trying to stop. 
  Al-'Attas affirmed that if the northerners continue the war 
and escalate hostitilies, many countries may hasten to recognize 
the Democratic Republic of Yemen. 
  Al-'Attas accused Iraq of intervening to help Sanaa in the 
current fighting. 
  He said the war has undermined the union and made the 
division of Yemen a fact. He remarked that Yemen cannot be 
stable if it continues to comprise two warring states and for 
this reason a formula must be found that would preserve each 
state's independence while still maintaining some relationship 
between them.

  [Text] Tripoli, 8 Jun (JANA) -- JANA's local affairs editor 
condemned the frantic attack launched by some British newspapers 
against Mrs. Queenie Fletcher, the mother of the English 
policewoman who was killed in London in 1984, as a result of the 
statements which she made during her visit to the Great 
Jamahiriyah a few days ago. 
  Mrs. Fletcher said [words indistinct] her visit to Libya 
gave 
her the opportunity to see the effect of the sanctions and the 
unjustified harm they caused to the Great Jamahiriyah. 
  She added: "I would like to say that I do not wish the death 
of my daughter to be exploited in order to impose sanctions on 
the Libyan people." 
  She expressed her wish that political relations between the 
Great Jamahiriyah and Britain should be restored to their 
previous state and that there would be no problems between the 
two countries. 
  The editor stressed that the British press campaign [words 
indistinct] the statements of Mrs. Fletcher and her initiative 
in visiting the Great Jamahiriyah could only be interpreted as 
official British sensitivity to any sincere attempt to get at 
the truth, or even fear that the truth, which is far removed 
from the falsification of facts to serve premeditated political 
ends, will be reached. 
  Otherwise why should Mrs. Fletcher's statement that she did 
not want her daughter's death to be exploited for the purpose of 
imposing sanctions on the Libyan people be received with this 
British media commotion? The British press's rejection of this 
statement implies direct support for the exploitation of the 
death of Mrs. Fletcher's daughter to achieve political aims, 
namely support for what the British Government has done in this 
regard. 
  The editor asks how the wishes of British citizens that 
their 
country's relations with other states should be free from 
problems can be turned into a crime, in the eyes of the British 
press, for which British citizens are held accountable and as a 
result of which they have pressure put on them to modify their 
position. 
  A press which adopts the policy of falsifying the facts and 
twisting the truth in order to serve political aims and cause 
harm to people is a press which speaks in the name of the devil 
and which works for the dominance of evil and hatred in the 
world.

<F P=106> [Report by Walid Abi-Murshid: "Iraqi Plan To Market Oil Via </F>
Foreign Front Companies"] 
  [Text] London -- Well-informed Iraqi sources stress that 
Baghdad has begun to implement a new marketing strategy for its 
oil sales under the direct supervision of Iraqi President Saddam 
Husayn's son, 'Udayy. 
  The new marketing policy relies on Iraqi-Iranian cooperation 
in connection with export facilities and on a network of front 
companies registered abroad as foreign companies, even though 
they are in practice owned by the Iraqi Government. 
  To this end the Iraqi Oil Ministry has set up two broker 
companies abroad under foreign names: the first in Amman to 
represent the seller (the Iraqi Government) and the second in 
Cyprus, headed by an Iraqi citizen, to represent the buyer. 
Under this arrangement Iraqi oil deals are concluded directly 
between the broker company in Amman (represented in the Iraqi 
Oil Ministry) and the Cypriot broker company (represented in the 
buyers) with a view to conceal the source of the oil sold. 
  The Iraqi sources say that the first deal concluded by the 
two companies in question involves exporting 6 million tons per 
year of Iraqi crude oil -- that is equivalent to 120,000 barrels 
a day -- at a value reaching $360 million. The price in this 
deal is set at $10 a barrel (provided it is changed according to 
market price fluctuations). Baghdad gets $5 from the price and 
Iran $3, on the basis that the Iraqi oil is transported to Iran 
either by land or sea -- via Umm Qasr port -- and then 
re-exported via Bandar-e Khomeyni. 
  As for the buyers, they consist of two quarters so far: a 
consortium comprising several international companies and an 
export and import company owned by East Europeans who have been 
dealing with Baghdad since the days of the Eastern bloc. They 
are now playing the role of broker between Baghdad and their 
governments. 
  The deal with the East European team includes exporting arms 
and military spares to Iraq in return for oil imported by the 
Cyprus-based company. 
  The Iraqi sources say that the Iraqi contract with the 
buying 
party includes opening a letter of credit by the buyer in a 
certain bank in Paris. 
  After the buyer receives the bill of lading, he orders the 
transfer of the sum to be paid to the Cyprus-based company's 
account in the same bank. 
  The Iraqi sources add that most of these sums are diverted 
to 
finance the Iraqi armament plan.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Udi Segal] </F>
  [Excerpts] Jerusalem perceives the Washington encounter as 
a genuine breakthrough between Israel and Jordan. The 
breakthrough was manifested in the agreement to set up working 
groups on specific issues, and especially the agreement to move 
the talks to Elat and al-'Aqabah. 
  Political elements said that following Israeli-Jordanian 
contacts held before the encounter, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
consented to discuss borders -- an issue which Israel had 
earlier opposed discussing -- while Jordan consented in 
principle to move the talks to the region. [passage omitted] 
  A senior Foreign Ministry source said, however, that the 
process would be long, possibly a year or two. He explained 
that objective difficulties, such as border demarcation and 
water resources control are part of the cause, but mainly he 
based his estimates on the assumption that al-Asad will not 
permit Husayn to clinch a separate deal with Israel. 
  What caused the turnabout in King Husayn's foreign policy? 
Jerusalem elements point to several reasons. King Husayn 
believes that a breakthrough on the Israeli-Syrian track is 
imminent. He, too, is aware of the intensive U.S. mediation, 
and he is afraid of being left out of the process. Syria, too, 
finds the presence of another partner convenient. Members of 
the Israeli delegation to talks with Jordan, who returned home 
last night, said their impression from the encounter with the 
Jordanians was that al-Asad had given Husayn a green light to 
make progress, albeit up to a certain point only, because he is 
not about to allow Jordan to sign a separate peace agreement. 
  An additional reason has to do with the Palestinians. 
Husayn, who was skeptical about the Israeli-PLO agreement, is 
now witnessing the implementation of that agreement, and he does 
not want facts -- particularly in the economic sphere -- to be 
established on the ground without his involvement and without 
consideration for Jordanian interests.

  [Text] Asked by the Jordanian News Agency about statements 
attributed to him regarding the occupied Syrian Golan, published 
by the London-based newspaper AL-HAYAH yesterday, Prime Minister 
Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali has asserted that the statement 
attributed to him was untrue and distorted. 
  Dr. al-Majali added: We reject any attempts to distort our 
strategic relations with sisterly Syria. We deal with Syria 
with full confidence in the unity of both our objective and 
fate, and also out of the desire to reach a comprehensive peace 
that will safeguard the rights of all of us and secure the 
implementation of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, on 
which the peace process is based. 
  Dr. al-Majali said: We look forward to discussing all issues 
of mutual interest during the meetings of the Joint 
Jordanian-Syrian Higher Committee, which will be held in Amman 
at the beginning of next week in order to achieve the policies 
of the two leaders; namely, His Majesty King Husayn and his 
brother His Excellency President Hafiz al-Asad, in a way that 
will achieve the utmost degree of cooperation and coordination 
between the two fraternal countries.

  [Text] The Russian delegation led by Mikhail Petrovich 
Kolesnikov, the Russian Armed Forces chief of staff, left 
Damascus today. President Hafiz al-Asad received the delegation 
for two full hours. 
  The Russian Armed Forces chief of staff signed with his 
Syrian counterpart, Lieutenant General Hikmat al-Shihabi, 12 
documents related to cooperation in the technical military field. 
  Mikhail Kolesnikov, head of the Russian delegation, termed 
this as a new starting point in Russian-Syrian military 
cooperation. 
  These documents were signed against the background of the 
agreement on military cooperation in the technical field that 
was signed in April between Syrian Defense Minister Lieutenant 
General Mustafa Talas and Russian Deputy Premier Oleg Soskovets. 
This agreement has paved the way for the resumption of military 
cooperation between the two countries, especially since the USSR 
was the main exporter of arms to Syria before its collapse.

  [Text] Mr. Ceslovas Jursenas, speaker of the Lithuanian 
parliament, and his delegation arrived in Damascus this evening 
on a four-day visit to Syria. 
  He was received at Damascus International Airport by 
'Abd-al- 
Qadir Qaddurah, speaker of the People's Assembly, and Shakir 
Is'ayyid, chairman of the Arab and Foreign Relations Committee 
in the Assembly. 
  Mr. Jursenas said upon arrival that he was glad to be 
visiting Syria. There have been no parliamentary relations 
between our two countries previously, he noted. During this 
visit, we want to get to know Syria first-hand and boost 
bilateral ties, particularly in parliamentary affairs, Mr. 
Jursenas told SANA. 
  This is the first time we have visited an Arab state since 
our independence. Our nation, he added, welcomes contacts and 
relations with Syria in particular and the Arab states in 
general. He emphasized that his country is particularly 
interested in the Middle East and the ongoing peace talks. 
Lithuania, he stated, supports the return of the occupied 
territory to its rightful owners. 
  The Lithuanian parliament speaker concluded his statement by 
saluting Syria and its people.

<F P=106> [Report by Salwa al-Ustuwani: "Velayati Concludes Talks in </F>
Damascus Which He Describes as `Very Positive'"] 
  [Excerpts] Damascus -- [Iranian Foreign Minister] Dr. 'Ali 
Akbar Velayati left Damascus yesterday for his country after a 
two-day visit to Syria during which he delivered a message to 
President Hafiz al-Asad from Iranian President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani. He also held meetings with Hizballah leaders 
at the Iranian Embassy in Damascus. [passage omitted] 
  Before departing from Damascus International Airport 
Velayati 
told reporters that his visit and talks in Damascus had been 
"very positive" and "extremely friendly." [passage omitted] 
  At another level, a Syrian official has told AL-SHARQ 
AL-AWSAT that Israel believes that by its aggression against 
Lebanon "it can bring about changes that would achieve what it 
wants and complement what it achieved in the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement." The official added that "the Israelis have 
forgotten -- or, rather, they deliberately pretend to have 
forgotten -- that the attacks will not get them the peace they 
are seeking. Because the foundations of peace are clear and the 
principles and terms of peace are more than clear. And anyone 
searching for peace must be fully committed to implementing UN 
resolutions. Aggression and threats of more extensive aggression 
will bring about nothing but further tension and will destroy 
the last opportunity to salvage the peace process, which has 
reached an impasse as a result of the Israeli positions opposed 
to any real peace. 
  The Syrian official pointed out that Tel Aviv -- as all the 
facts indicate -- is seeking not only to cause strain in the 
situation in the region, but also to push the region toward an 
atmosphere of war. 
  The Syrian official said that the United States and the 
international community are urged to put an end to the Israeli 
aggression aimed not only against Lebanon, but the U.S. 
initiative and the peace process as well.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] Under the headline "The Peace Process and the U.S. 
Problem," the newspaper AL-BA'TH comments on U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher's upcoming tour of the region, saying: 
What is important is to know how far the peace process has gone, 
and to evaluate the efforts made by the full partner in this 
regard. The United States has chosen to play the role of a full 
partner. This U.S. commitment has placed responsibility on the 
shoulders of the U.S. Administration. It has made it incumbent 
on the U.S. Administration to honor the terms of reference 
agreed upon for the peace process it launched. That is, this 
commitment requires the U.S. Administration to uphold the 
relevant UN resolutions, and the principles of international 
legitimacy, as well. 
  In this regard, there is no room for anything called 
neutrality, or the role of a mailman. For the United States 
does not have responsibilities only in its capacity as the 
actual sponsor of the peace process, but also in its capacity as 
the greatest power on Earth at present, and as a member of the 
UN Security Council, not to mention its responsibilities with 
regard to UN resolutions. Given all this, there is no room for 
neutrality. The United States can either be a supporter or an 
opponent of international legitimacy. 
  The paper adds: We in Syria support international 
resolutions and charters. In the same vein, we support the 
principles and objectives of the peace process. We have agreed 
to participate in this process on the basis of the parameters 
the United States proposed to regional players. We have 
cooperated to make this process a success, because we actually 
look forward to attaining a just and comprehensive peace. 
  The paper indicates that Israel, which is opposed to 
international legitimacy, has defied the international community 
and rebelled against it. Worse still, it has violated the 
resolutions of the world body. Hence, the problem lies in the 
Israeli position. The paper adds: We are not asking the United 
States to side with either Syria or the Arabs. What we are 
demanding is that the United States support the terms of 
reference of the peace initiative it has launched. Moreover, we 
are asking it to uphold international resolutions. Any 
departure from this would be a concession to those who have 
rebelled against such legitimacy and acted against peace. 
  AL-BA'TH concludes by saying: If the U.S. Administration is 
to play its role as a full partner in the peace process in a 
convincing manner, it should not succumb to the lame Israeli 
reasoning, which is grounded in usurpation, occupation, and 
aggression. This is a must if the region is to be rid of the 
vicious circle of escalation, tension, wars, and bloodshed. 
  Under the headline "From the Peace Opportunity to War," the 
newspaper AL-THAWRAH says: Israel, which has constantly managed 
to avert any progress in the stalemated peace talks, has 
exacerbated the situation and driven the region to the point of 
explosion under the very nose of the entire world community in 
order to kill the current peace opportunity once and for all. 
  The paper believes the constant and escalating Israeli 
aggression against Lebanon poses the greatest challenge to the 
international community, which has seen how Israel has dealt 
successive blows to the peace process, which in turn has turned 
into crossword puzzle entangled by Israeli conditions, excuses, 
and aggressive practices. 
  The paper urges the international community and the United 
States to put an end to Israeli belligerence and arrogance, to 
Israel's disregard for international resolutions and the 
international community's efforts to achieve a just and 
comprehensive peace. It also calls upon them to immediately 
halt all forms of Israeli aggression. 
  Concluding its commentary, the paper says: Unless the 
international community shoulders its responsibilities by 
deterring Israeli aggression, this aggression will push the 
region in the direction of an explosion, whose results are 
unpredictable. 
  In another commentary entitled "Where is Justice," the 
newspaper AL-THAWRAH says: The situation in southern Lebanon 
has seen a serious deterioration. It has become a hotbed of 
tension that threatens to drown the region in an endless 
whirlpool of violence and chaos, thanks to the constant Israeli 
attacks on southern Lebanese villages and towns. 
  The paper explains that the continuation of this serious 
situation in southern Lebanon, caused by the escalation of 
constant Israeli attacks, will cause the peace process to 
collapse and dash all the hopes for a just and comprehensive 
peace in the Middle East. 
  The paper holds Israeli leaders responsible for this 
uncomfortable situation, and also for the failure of the 
stalemated peace process to bear fruit.

  [Text] Jordanian Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali 
has denied the statements attributed to him regarding the 
occupied Syrian Golan, published by the London-based newspaper 
AL-HAYAH yesterday [as heard], saying that these statements were 
untrue and distorted. 
  In a statement to the Jordanian News Agency yesterday, Dr. 
al-Majali added: Jordan rejects any attempts to confuse its 
strategic relations with sisterly Syria. Jordan regards Syria 
with absolute faith in common objectives and destiny to reach a 
just and comprehensive peace that will safeguard the rights of 
all of us, and ensure the implementation of UN Security Council 
Resolutions 242 and 338, on which the peace process is based.

<F P=106> [Report by Sana' al-Imam from Damascus] </F>
  [Text] Damascus today strongly criticized the Jordanian 
paper AL-RA'Y, which in recent articles has called on the 
Jordanian Government to conclude an agreement with Israel as 
soon as possible to make sure Jordan is not isolated and its 
role is not marginalized, especially since Arab coordination 
among the frontline states does not exist, as the paper put it. 
  In its editorial today, the government newspaper, TISHRIN, 
said that these opinions are preparing the way for the peddling 
of a really bad plan. The paper added that such a plan would 
isolate Jordan from the Arab world and tamper with its national 
unity. These calls are made by hired writers to inject Zionist 
poison into Arab awareness with the objective of pushing it 
toward capitulation. 
  The official Syrian newspaper refuted the opinions of the 
writer of the article, who said that Syria has abandoned Jordan, 
that it is only considering a separate solution, and that an 
agreement between Syria and Israel is imminent. The paper said 
that these statements are prematurely seeking to distort the 
essence of the Syrian position. This is because Syria has never 
called for throwing oneself into Israel's arms, and has always 
announced its commitment to the principle of a comprehensive 
solution and the need for the implementation of Resolutions 242, 
338, and 425, and for Israel's withdrawal to the pre-4 June 1967 
border in return for comprehensive peace. 
  The paper wondered: What progress has been achieved to make 
the Jordanian writer call for expediting the signing of a 
separate agreement with Israel before it is too late? The 
negotiations with Israel are still moving in a vicious circle. 
The U.S. secretary of state has admitted this and said that the 
gap is too deep between the two stands. Even Rabin said that 
matters on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks are at a stalemate. 
  TISHRIN said: Arab coordination does exist, and Syria was 
the first to insist on coordination among the Arab parties. 
Even Jordanian officials have recently spoken, following King 
Husayn's visit to Damascus, about the importance of coordination 
and integration with Syria. This means that the writer of the 
articles considers the statements of Jordanian officials on 
their adherence to the principle of a comprehensive solution and 
coordination with the Arab parties mere maneuvering for local 
audiences for the time being.

<F P=106> [Report by Salwa al-Ustuwani: "Damascus Renews Its </F>
Rejection of `Majdal Shams First' Plan"] 
  [Excerpts] Damascus, Cairo, Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- 
Damascus has informed Washington of its rejection of the Israeli 
peace plan conveyed by U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher during his recent shuttle tour of the region, known 
as the "Majdal Shams First" peace plan. 
  Well-informed sources in Cairo have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT 
that the Israeli plan includes a three-phase Israeli withdrawal 
from the Golan Heights; the first phase includes a withdrawal 
from three out of five villages on the Heights. [passage 
omitted] 
  The sources pointed out that Israel does not want to 
implement an integrated peace process at once on all 
Arab-Israeli tracks. It is seeking to conduct partial and 
phased implementation on each track individually, with a 
transitional phase after the implementation of each peace plan. 
  Well-informed Syrian sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT 
that 
Washington held meetings the evening of the day before yesterday 
with Syria, Lebanon, and Israel in preparation, the sources 
believe, for a discussion of the issue of Christopher's return 
to the region to continue his efforts regarding the peace 
process. [passage omitted] 
  In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT a Syrian official held 
Israel responsible for increasing tension in the region and 
pushing the peace process toward collapse. 
  The official said that "Israel continues to deliberately 
escalate the situation and work to create a climate and 
conditions for continuing the war and exposing the Lebanese 
people's lives to danger and annihilation -- which threatens to 
destroy the peace process." The Syrian official stressed "the 
resoluteness of the Lebanese and Syrian position in the 
negotiation process, and no one can separate the two tracks." 
  The official added that "Israel's aggressive practices 
against Lebanon have exceeded all limits. No one can remain 
silent about them, they must be confronted. Israeli aggression 
must be confronted." The official urged the international 
community to put an end to the policy of murder and destruction 
which has become an integral part of Israel's strategy for the 
occupation of southern Lebanon. 
  The official described Israel's practices in southern 
Lebanon 
as terrorist actions, pointing out that this puts the region as 
a whole in a troubled and serious atmosphere and brings to mind 
the atmosphere of the war Israel is once again seeking. The 
official said: "Thus a prompt move is needed to stop Israeli 
practices, provocations, and the positions adopted by Yitzhaq 
Rabin's government," adding that Israel would be very mistaken 
if it believes that it can continue to have a free hand to 
strike as it wishes. It must realize well that Lebanese 
resistance is stronger than Israeli aggression, because it is a 
legitimate right and supported by international legitimacy."

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] Today's press commentaries address the objectives of 
the ceaseless Israeli attacks on Lebanon, and Israeli officials' 
threats to launch a large-scale aggression. 
  Under the headline "The Future of the Peace Process," the 
newspaper TISHRIN says: The peace process has become a target 
for Israeli officials, who were compelled to attend the Madrid 
conference in the first place, thwarted the Washington talks, 
disavowed the essence of the U.S. peace initiative, and made a 
deliberate effort to scuttle U.S. efforts. 
  The paper adds: Judging by Israeli acts, one can safely say 
that Israel's acts run counter to the principles and objectives 
of the peace process. For, the shelling and bombardment of 
villages and towns in southern Lebanon, the displacement of 
Lebanese civilians, the destruction of their property, and the 
killing of innocent people in premeditated barbarous air raids 
have become the order of the day for Israeli officials. As for 
their political discourse on peace, it is merely deceptive talk 
designed to delude the world public. For, the peace talks have 
not registered the slightest progress on the Syrian and Lebanese 
tracks. As for the Gaza-Jericho accord, it has pushed the 
opportunities for peace further away, and dealt a painful blow 
to the efforts to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the 
Middle East. 
  TISHRIN urges the international community, headed by the 
United States, to intervene to put an end to Israeli aggression, 
which is targeting Lebanon, just as much as it is targeting the 
U.S. initiative and the peace process. 
  The paper wonders: Has not the region been pushed further 
away from the desired just and comprehensive peace? Why has 
United States failed to push the peace process in the right 
direction, given that it has committed itself to play the role 
of a full partner and honest broker? 
  TISHRIN concludes by saying: The failure of the 
international community to put the necessary pressure on Israeli 
leaders to make them comply with its resolutions and principles 
has encouraged them to perpetrate further massacres and crimes, 
and to demonstrate total disregard for the peace process and 
international legitimacy, as well. 
  The newspaper AL-THAWRAH addresses the same issue, saying: 
Given the serious Israeli escalation of the military situation 
in southern Lebanon, the international community must have 
become fully convinced that the Rabin government holds the peace 
process in contempt. For judging by its words and deeds, one 
reaches the conclusion that this government seeks to frustrate 
the hopes for a just and comprehensive solution in the Middle 
East, and to create further obstacles and difficulties that can 
only exacerbate the situation and render it more precarious. 
  AL-THAWRAH adds: The Israeli military buildup in southern 
Lebanon, as well as the constant Israeli attacks there make it 
impossible for observers to identify any single Israeli positive 
step. This is certainly not an indication of an Israeli desire 
to achieve peace in the full sense of the word. 
  Concluding its commentary, the paper says: The Tel Aviv 
government must understand that the party that is seeking peace 
cannot work to stoke fires in southern Lebanon, nor can it 
resort to military power and arrogance to force its dictates and 
conditions on others. Nor can it, for that matter, flaunt its 
defiance of the relevant international resolutions, and the 
principles cherished by the international community. For peace 
has its own well-known components and requirements. Once the 
Rabin government declares its commitment to these components and 
requirements, and renounces its policy of provocation and 
aggression, then, and only then can there be talk of just and 
comprehensive peace. But, given the current state of affairs, 
one can say that Israel is as far as it can ever be from peace. 
Worse still, nobody can trust the sincerity of its peace claims. 
  For its part, the newspaper AL-BA'TH comments on the same 
issue, reiterating that the continuous Israeli attacks on 
Lebanon are indicative of Israel's aggressive character, and 
also of its disregard for regional security and peace, and the 
entire world community as well. 
  The paper believes that this Israeli policy has been 
supported by the position of the international community, 
represented by the United Nations and the UN Security Council in 
particular. This is because Israel is the only party in the 
world that escapes punishment whenever it perpetrates 
aggressions against the Arabs, kills innocent civilians, and 
destroys their houses. 
  In this regard, the paper notes the massacre Israel 
perpetrated on Thursday [9 June], which resulted in the death of 
scores of Lebanese civilians. Israel has persisted with its 
aggression and massive military buildup on Lebanese territory, 
the paper adds. 
  The paper wonders: Will Israeli acts lead to just and 
comprehensive peace in the region? 
  The paper explains that had Israel been actually seeking 
peace, it would have, at least, declared a commitment to the 
terms of reference of the peace process; that is, it would have 
expressed a willingness to implement the relevant international 
resolutions, which provide for complete and full withdrawal from 
the occupied Arab territories. Nonetheless, what we, along with 
the entire world community, have seen is Israel doing its best 
to keep the region away from true peace. 
  The paper concludes by saying: The requirements, components, 
and obligations of just and comprehensive peace are too clear to 
be obscured. They have been recognized and identified by the 
entire international community. He who wants to see the region 
enjoying security, stability, and peace must, first and 
foremost, make a total commitment to implementing the relevant 
international resolutions. As for the policy of aggression and 
threats, it will only create further tension, and consequently 
kill the last opportunity for saving the peace process.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: The Israeli leaders are trying to group 
contradictory things together. They also believe they can 
convince the world that they are saying and doing the right 
things. These leaders are carrying out flagrantly savage 
attacks on Lebanon and destroying homes over the very heads of 
their peaceful civilian inhabitants. At the same time, they 
allege that these attacks are not directed against the peace 
process and will not affect it. 
  The Israelis are also carrying out acts of piracy and 
abduction and encroaching upon the sovereignty of a UN member 
state. Moreover, they daily threaten Lebanon with an open war. 
In their statements, however, the Israelis are trying to 
convince the world that all this does not mean they have 
abandoned the peace process or the objective of obtaining peace. 
But how can a reasonable man be convinced that the large 
military buildup in the occupied part of southern Lebanon as 
well as the threats, the continued shelling of southern Lebanese 
villages and towns, and the beating of war drums can be in 
harmony with the atmosphere of peace? 
  It is impossible to put summer and winter together. Israel's 
contradictions and allegations will convince anyone. If the 
Israelis believe they can mislead the world and portray their 
savage attacks as a defense of Israeli security, they are 
undoubtedly deluded. This is because the actions of the 
Lebanese national resistance are a result, and not a cause, of 
occupation. Thus, as long as the occupation continues, the 
resistance will continue because it is the Lebanese people's 
right, as acknowledged by all international laws and norms. 
  If Israel is working to achieve its security, as it claims, 
all it has to do is to comply with UN resolutions, particularly 
Resolution 425 which calls on Israel to unconditionally withdraw 
its forces from southern Lebanon. It has become well known that 
Israeli security has never been threatened and that the opposite 
is actually true. In other words, Arab security is currently 
threatened, and for more than half a century the Arabs have been 
subjected to Israeli aggression. Moreover, the Arab territories 
are still under occupation at a time when Israeli aircraft, 
artillery, tanks, and warships bombard and destroy Arab 
villages, towns, and houses in Lebanon and other Arab 
territories and kill Arabs. So, it is not the opposite that is 
taking place. 
  For those who want further confirmation and information on 
who is the aggressor and who is the victim, and who is the 
executioner and who is the victim, the records of the United 
Nations, specifically the UN Security Council, are replete with 
resolutions condemning Israel for its aggressions against the 
Arabs 
  From this premise, the security excuse is not convincing. 
Israel is trying to use this card to cover up its real stand 
and reason for escalating its aggression against Lebanon. On 
one hand, Israel wants to bring the utmost pressure to bear on 
Lebanon to confuse it and force it to submit to its conditions 
which Lebanon rejected at the negotiation table. Israel wants 
to separate Lebanon from Syria and to end coordination between 
them as part of its policy of dealing with the Arab parties one 
after the other, thus making it easier for it to impose its 
conditions and will on them and to drag them into partial 
agreements and separate deals that would secure its hegemony and 
control over the land it occupies. 
  What is more important is that by carrying out aggression 
and 
threatening to wage an open war against Lebanon, Israel would 
thus resort to the most effective means for torpedoing the peace 
process because a just and comprehensive peace limits its moves, 
checks its designs for expansion, and demarcates its borders 
which, as yet, have been demarcated only on the basis of the 
well-known Zionist concept of the borders from the Euphrates to 
the Nile. 
  By igniting the situation in Lebanon, Israel brings the 
region to the brink of war and makes it move far from the peace 
which the entire world seeks to establish in this region whose 
people have been afflicted with wars and destruction since 
Israel's establishment. 
  It goes without saying that the absence of a deterring 
punishment of the agressor, the adoption of two yardsticks, and 
the failure to adopt a firm stand toward the recurrent Israeli 
attacks against the Arabs, encourage Israeli leaders to continue 
threatening the opportunities for peace, and push the region to 
the brink of war. 
  Had the international community been as firm and as decisive 
as it was in other areas in confronting the aggressor and 
forcing it to implement UN resolutions, Israel would not have 
continued its defiance of the international community, and peace 
in the region would have been closer than at any other time. 
  Israel is exposing peace and security in the region to 
unfathomable dangers. The international community, specifically 
the sponsors of the peace process, should take the initiative 
before the opportunity is lost and peace is endangered.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] Under the headline "The Dangers of Reckless Israeli 
Behavior," TISHRIN says in its editorial today: After the 
signing of the Cairo agreement on the implementation of the Oslo 
deal, Israel increased its aggression in southern Lebanon, 
intensified its daily shelling of residential areas there, and 
carried out a glaring act of piracy when it kidnapped a Lebanese 
citizen, thus violating all international agreements and human 
rights. 
  TISHRIN adds: It is worth noting that that terrorist 
operation took place under the direct supervision of Yitzhaq 
Rabin himself, something which proves that the Israeli political 
and military decisionmaking is controlled by a terrorist 
mentality. Moreover, Israel launched a savage raid on the 
Ba'labakk area, and is now amassing more troops and equipment 
and escalating its expansionist, aggressive language against 
Lebanon. 
  The paper indicates that through that behavior Israel is 
seeking to escalate regional tension, kindle war and aggression, 
and ruin the peace climate in order to undermine the peace 
process and destroy all its bases. Israel is also seeking to 
undermine the process of national reconciliation in Lebanon, 
thus reaffirming that it sought and still seeks to control 
Lebanon and its resources. The paper stresses that separate 
deals neither achieve peace in the region, nor provide peace and 
stability for Arabs or restore their rights. Nor have they 
ended Israeli intransigence, arrogance, and aggressive, 
expansionist behavior. 
  The paper says that Israel has violated the principles of 
the 
peace process and is now pushing the region to war and 
confrontation, thus defying the will of the international 
community and the U.S. initiative for peace in the region. 
  The paper reiterates that Syria and the Arabs have joined 
the 
peace process to restore the occupied Arab territories and the 
usurped Arab rights. 
  Concluding its editorial, TISHRIN says: If the international 
community and the United States in particular are interested in 
the success of the peace initiative, they must work to curb the 
unruly aggressive Israeli behavior and to pressure the Israeli 
Government into compliance with the principles of a just, 
comprehensive regional peace.

  [Text] Gentlemen: No doubt, each Israeli attack on 
Lebanese territory and citizens is also an attack on 
international legitimacy, a violation of international law, and 
a threat to the regional peace process. 
  By escalating its attacks in such a provocative manner 
against Lebanon and its citizens, villages, and residential 
areas, Israel not only shows disregard for the international 
community's will, but also deliberately complicates and 
aggravates the regional situation and pushes this region toward 
the brink of an abyss so that Israel can implement its schemes, 
maintain its occupation of the Arab territories, and evade the 
obligations of a just and comprehensive peace. 
  Israel still refuses to withdraw from the occupied Arab 
territories in accordance with the Security Council resolutions 
and the land-for-peace principle. Beyond this, Israel is still 
approaching the peace process as an occupying force that adheres 
to the gains of occupation from an arrogant and dominating 
position. 
  Israel has proven this through its hostility toward the 
peace 
process and through its maneuvering and tricks. By escalating 
its attacks on Lebanese territory, Israel once again confirms 
that it will not abandon its aggressive and expansionist 
ambitions designed to annex the Arab territories and drag the 
Arabs into making concessions and relinquishing their own rights 
by mixing the regional cards and evading all that would make 
Israel comply with the terms and components of the peace process. 
  More than two and a half years have passed since the peace 
process began and there has been nothing yet to indicate that 
Israel is ready to withdraw from the Golan and southern Lebanon. 
Added to this is what continues to take place both in and with 
regard to the occupied Palestinian territories before and after 
the Oslo agreement. 
  All events and developments before and after the Oslo 
agreement confirm that Israel only needs a group to follow its 
orders, implement its instructions, and take part in repressing 
the Palestinian people on their own territory, which iw exactly 
what the Lahd mercenaries in southern Lebanon are doing against 
the Lebanese people and their townships and villages. 
  The savage Israeli shelling of al-Biqa', the Israeli 
military 
buildup in the occupied part of southern Lebanon, and the Lahd 
troops' joining of the Israeli forces in shelling the southern 
Lebanese villages, townships, and cities have all revealed an 
important fact that no one should forget; namely, that the 
aggressive Israeli character, which practices abductions, 
killings, and destruction, is placing the entire region in a 
turbulent and feverish atmosphere and in a volatile situation, 
especially since these practices recall the atmosphere which 
Israel wants. 
  As Israeli aggressions has exceeded all limits, it is 
necessary to confront this belligerence through an international 
response that will end the policy of killings and destruction. 
Moreover, the international community, which is eager to 
maintain the peace process, should take the initiative and stop 
the continuous Israeli encroachments and oblige Israel to comply 
with the UN resolutions. 
  Israel's refusal to implement Resolution 425 and other UN 
resolutions, which call for Israeli withdrawal from the occupied 
Arab territories, is a flagrant rejection of international 
legitimacy and disregards the principles of international law 
through aggravating the situation in southern Lebanon, spreading 
the atmosphere of war in it, and continuing the shelling of 
southern Lebanese villages, townships, and cities. 
  Hence, confronting the aggressive Israeli character is not 
only a duty and right for the Lebanese people--who have 
emphasized the importance of, and need for, continuing the 
resistance and rallying around it--but is also an Arab and 
international responsibility that first stems from the need to 
expose and foil the Israeli objectives and pressure Israel into 
complying with the terms and components of the peace process, 
led by full withdrawal from the Golan and southern Lebanon.

  [Text] Damascus (SANA) -- The Joint Syrian-Lebanese Water 
Committee held a meeting at the Ministry of Irrigation yesterday 
attended by Nasri Khuri, secretary general of the Higher 
Syrian-Lebanese Council. 
  Later, Khuri made a statement to the Syrian Arab News Agency 
correspondent on the topics which were studied by the committee. 
He said: At its previous meeting in Beirut on 3 February 1994, 
which was devoted to studying the subject of building a dam on 
the Orontes River, the Joint Water Committee set up a joint 
technical committee to explore the river course from the source 
to Lake Qattinah in order to inspect the existing gauge station, 
determine the new stations required, and study the flow of water 
both at the surface and underground levels for the longest 
period possible. 
  Khuri added: "The joint technical committee had carried out 
its exploration of the Orontes River course, held several 
meetings to review its findings, and submitted its report to the 
main committee." 
  Khuri said: "Yesterday's meeting was devoted to studying the 
facts contained in this report. It was agreed to adopt the 
technical committee's recommendations on gauging the annual 
average flow, revamping and operating the existing gauge station 
on the Lebanese side, and studying the building of a hydraulic 
station on the same side. This is in addition to the adoption 
of several other recommendations." 
  The secretary general explained that the Joint Water 
Committee decided to devote its next meeting, which is scheduled 
to be held in Beirut on 20 June, to studying the question of 
current and future water needs to be supplied by the Orontes 
River course and to begin accumulating data on the needs to be 
supplied by the southern al-Kabir River. 
  Khuri expressed the hope that all studies on the Orontes 
River would be completed prior to proposing future solutions 
concerning the exploitation of the river and consequently the 
signing of a Syrian-Lebanese agreement on whatever is reached in 
this regard.

<F P=106> [Report by Daniyel Ben-Simon and Moti Bassok] </F>
  [Text] Knesset Member [MK] Ra'anan Kohen, member of the 
Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, claims that 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and Jordan's King Husayn held a 
secret meeting in London. According to Kohen, the two leaders 
met on 2 June to wrap up the details of the negotiations between 
the two countries. 
  MK Kohen yesterday queried Minister Peres: "I learned from 
foreign sources," Kohen writes, "that the foreign minister met 
King Husayn in London on Thursday, 2 June. I was told that 
during the meeting, the directions of the negotiations between 
us and Jordan were agreed on." 
  In his query to Peres, Kohen notes that "the efforts to 
promote the negotiations with Jordan deserve praise and 
encouragement. I would like to ask: Is this report true? If 
it is, what can you tell us about the proceedings of the 
meeting? Does the honorable minister believe that progress on 
the Jordanian track is linked to progress in contacts with 
Syria?" 
  Two days ago, Minister Yosi Sarid said he believes that the 
negotiations with Syria are now in high gear. He believes that 
Peres met central figures during his tour abroad in order to 
promote the negotiations. Sarid noted that he does not know of 
a meeting in London between Peres and Husayn. He stressed that 
Prime Minister Rabin was the key figure in drafting the 
understandings between Israel and Jordan. Sarid expressed his 
certainty that the understandings with Jordan were made with 
Syria's knowledge, and that the negotiations between Israel and 
Syria are making satisfactory progress. 
  Moti Bassok reports that the Foreign Ministry determinately 
refused to comment on the Peres-Husayn meeting. It is worth 
noting that in the tripartite meeting with the Israeli and U.S. 
delegations in Washington on 6 and 7 June, the Jordanian 
delegation showed much openness and willingness to advance which 
very much surprised its interlocutors. 
  A senior Israeli delegation source noted that there is no 
doubt that the Jordanian delegation was given explicit 
instructions from King Husayn to pull the cart of negotiations 
with Israel out of the mud they have been stuck in since 14 
September 1993, and to move forward on many areas, including the 
sensitive issue of borders. 
  According to the source, Husayn fears that if he continues 
his foot-dragging policy, the Palestinians and the Syrians would 
leave him behind without an agreement with Israel and in a very 
sensitive security and political situation. It appears that 
Husayn was also given a go-ahead from the Syrians because it is 
very important for President al-Asad to be portrayed as working 
toward a comprehensive Middle East arrangement and as caring for 
the entire Arab world.

<F P=106> [Interview with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by </F>
correspondent Yaron Deqel on 9 June; place not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Our political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen reports 
that high-level sources have confirmed that Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin held a secret meeting with King Husayn a few days 
ago. It was that meeting which led to the breakthrough in the 
talks between Israel and Jordan. Our correspondent Yaron Deqel 
today asked the prime minister about the secret contacts. 
Yitzhaq Rabin neither confirmed nor denied the meeting. 
  [Begin recording] [Deqel] Mr. Prime Minister, has progress 
with Jordan been achieved in the wake of some type of secret 
talks which were held recently? 
  [Rabin] I will not address myself to the reasons that led to 
this progress. I think there are many reasons, the main one 
being Jordan's willingness to make slow moves toward a peace 
treaty. Will this treaty be signed before progress is made with 
Syria, or not? I do not have an answer. [end recording] 
  [Later during the broadcast, political correspondent 
'Imanu'el Rosen relays a live report from Tel Aviv, stressing 
that "the recent breakthrough with Jordan was surely not 
accidental. A process of several weeks, of three weeks at 
least, involving secret contacts, away from the media, had taken 
place. The details of the recent meeting in Washington were 
concluded more than two weeks ago. Incidentally, even some of 
the delegation members were not aware of the nature of the 
agreement. In short, we were told by high-level sources that a 
meeting did take place between Yitzhaq Rabin and King Husayn. 
The prime minister's bureau refuses to confirm this meeting, 
but states that very high-level contacts indeed took place."]

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Terje Rod Larsen, UN assistant </F>
secretary general responsible for the Middle East, by Bjorn 
Lindahl in Oslo on 1 June] 
  [Text] Oslo -- "As of yesterday Israel stopped paying for 
the civilian administration in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. What 
is important now is that the money from the rest of the world 
arrives in the bank so that the Palestinian police force can be 
paid its wages and can find somewhere to live. The situation in 
Gaza is very serious." 
  So said Terje Rod Larsen, the new UN assistant secretary 
general with responsibility for the Middle East. Wednesday [1 
June] should have been his first working day, but a funeral in 
Oslo meant that he asked for a postponement for a couple of days 
and together with his wife and close aide, Mona Juul, he found 
time for an interview with SVENSKA DAGBLADET. For the past nine 
months the two have been involved in what has been called family 
therapy between Israel and the PLO. 
  We met at Terje Rod Larsen's office at Fafo, the Trade Union 
Center for Research, Investigation, and Documentation where he 
was the director before he was appointed a Norwegian Foreign 
Ministry ambassador and subsequently one of the five UN 
assistant secretaries general. 
  Mona Juul works as head of division at the Norwegian foreign 
minister's office. 
  Together they formed the core of the secret Oslo channel 
which led to the agreement in principle on Palestinian 
self-rule. Since the results of this work became known, the 
role of the channel has decreased. 
  "But the need for a non-public channel remains. As recently 
as last night I was contacted by one of the sides," Terje Rod 
Larsen said. It is uncertain what will happen to the channel in 
the future. 
  "Norwegian Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore Godal has already had 
several meetings with both sides and is available if the sides 
wish it," Mona Juul said. 
  It is not only in the Middle East conflict that Norway plays 
a key role. In June peace talks between the guerrillas and the 
government in Guatemala will begin in Oslo. There is also an 
ambition that Norway should mediate in conflicts in Sudan and 
Sri Lanka, as well as in the former Yugoslavia, where former 
Foreign Minister Thorvald Stoltenberg is UN mediator. 
  Just as the Norwegian media showed little restraint when it 
came to giving Norway the credit for the fact that Israel and 
the PLO finally reached a peace agreement, there has been tide 
of small-minded criticism inside the Norwegian Foreign Ministry 
recently that too many resources are being used on peace work in 
distant countries which does not benefit Norway economically. 
  "There is not enough shopkeeping and too much ideology and 
missionary work at the Foreign Ministry. We have clearly taken 
over Sweden's role as everyone's benefactor. The Swedes have 
scaled down the moral steering of their international 
relations," a Norwegian Foreign Ministry official pointed out. 
  For Terje Rod Larsen a view like this borders on the absurd: 
  "The Oslo channel was a `low-budget film' where the costs 
were limited to the wages of three to four people and airline 
tickets. 
  "The United States has spent more than $50 million on the 
multilateral peace negotiations without any results." According 
to Larsen, these were doomed to failure. 
  "The Americans skipped the first stage of international 
negotiations which consists in sounding out in what areas there 
is a desire to reach an agreement. The PLO has a delegation of 
160 in Washington, and Israel has a similar number. The whole 
thing turned into a permanent press conference at which both 
sides were simply speaking to their home publics. 
  "There is something called press freedom, but freedom from 
the press can be just as important for the democratic process. 
If the sides are not given time to build confidence in each 
other, it is impossible to achieve results," Larsen said. 
  "But it is important that nothing is concealed afterward, 
once the sides have reached agreement. That is why we have 
tried to be as open as possible afterward," Mona Juul added. 
  The appointment of Terje Rod Larsen as assistant secretary 
general has also been criticized as an attempt by the United 
Nations to buy some of the glory surrounding the Oslo agreement. 
  "The United Nations would never have been able to play a 
role 
like the one Norway played. The Israelis have always been very 
skeptical toward the United Nations and have often felt unjustly 
treated, because they have had the majority of members against 
them in the General Assembly so many times," Mona Juul pointed 
out. 
  Norway's involvement in the autonomous Palestinian areas is 
greater than that of any other country. As well as the informal 
channel Norway is also responsible for coordinating foreign aid 
to the autonomous areas and to the police force. 
  Norway also has the largest group of observers in Hebron and 
is represented in the multinational peace negotiations which are 
held in Washington. 
  In money terms Norway will donate 250 million kronor 
[currency not specified] over 5 years. 
  "I will continue to work in all four areas, but as a 
representative of the United Nations," Terje Rod Larsen said. 
Within a month he expects that with the help of the heads of the 
UN body for aid for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA [United Nations 
Relief and Works Agency], development body UNDP [United Nations 
Development Program], and Unicef he will put forward a plan for 
the coordination of the work of the United Nations. 
  "UNRWA is the biggest UN organization and has 8,000 
employees 
on the West Bank and in Gaza. Alongside the Palestinian 
administration it will play a major role in the work of building 
up the economies of the Palestinian areas. 
  "In the short term the new Palestinian administration is 
facing the acute problem that while the international aid group 
has promised $2.2 billion -- or 14 billion kronor -- in aid over 
five years, almost none of this is in the bank. There is only 
the $2 million which Norway has given, $5 million from the 
United States, and a promise of 10 million Ecu (91.14 million 
kronor) from the EU [European Union] that has not yet been paid 
out to run the Palestinian police force, which when complete 
will consist of 9,000 policemen. 
  Each policeman is expected to cost $1,600 per month -- and 
this means that the total cost per year will be around $170 
million. 
  "The police force is crucial if chaos is to be prevented in 
Gaza. If the police do not receive money for themselves and 
their families, their loyalty will rapidly evaporate. It has 
even been necessary to distribute Israeli military rations to 
provide food for the day. In addition the Palestinian 
administration takes over responsibility for the 7,000 
Palestinians who were employed by the Israeli military 
administration. 
  "Norway has called a very important meeting of the 
aid-giving 
nations in Paris for 9-10 June. At this meeting they will have 
to demonstrate a willingness to redirect some of the money they 
have promised so that a larger share can be used to meet 
day-to-day costs. The problem is that most countries have taken 
the money from their aid budgets and have tied it to specific 
projects," Terje Rod Larsen said. 
  Next on Terje Rod Larsen's agenda are talks in New York with 
UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and the U.S. 
Administration. A reconnaissance tour of the autonomous areas 
will follow.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-Jabbar al-Barghuthi from Tunis] </F>
  [Text] Palestinian Leader Yasir 'Arafat has affirmed that 
he will not deceive his people regarding the deteriorating 
financial situation that the PLO is experiencing. In an 
interview with AL-QUDS, he asked: How could I enter my country 
with this deadly financial crisis? I must have something in my 
hand with which I will be able to ease the suffering of my 
struggling people. Nevertheless, the date of my return and the 
return of the Palestinian leadership will be determined shortly, 
God willing. We will announce this to all in due time. 
  'Arafat said: The donor states will meet tomorrow. I will 
attend the meeting to secure approval for the aid that the donor 
nations will provide when they set a definite date, despite 
their several considerations and their relatively harsh 
bureaucracy, which requires that they must await the result of 
their study of our projects and our return to the homeland. 
  He added: We will remind the donor states that they must 
keep their promises. We must not let them promise us and then 
not keep their promises. They have promised us funds to help us 
build our future state. It is the future and the obligations it 
incurs. We must continue our efforts with these states to 
persuade them of our projects, our country's infrastructure, and 
the state it has reached. 
  On his view of the Palestinians' future and what the masses 
should do to contribute to this future, Abu-'Ammar ['Arafat] 
said: Our future is proceeding, God willing, in steady steps 
toward better times. Having set foot on our chaste land, we 
will achieve what we have all aspired to in terms of 
establishing a state, stability, freedom, and democracy. 
Naturally, this will be achieved through the cohesion and 
solidarity of all the sons of our people, the ending of hatred, 
and the unification of efforts to build with strong fists, which 
will continue to work day and night. We will not look backward 
but always forward, leaving behind us the false slogans and the 
subversive and tendentious rumors. 
  Regarding the Israelis' attempts to impose a fait accompli 
that Jerusalem is their capital, he said that holy Jerusalem is 
in his conscience, mind, and heart. He said that as long as 
there is a Declaration of Principles and an agreement to discuss 
the issue of Jerusalem, whatever the Israelis say is for local 
consumption and to satisfy the motives of various sectors of the 
Jewish people. 
  He said: They use the Torah as a reference. We use what is 
much more recent, the "Umari Covenant" [Pledge by Caliph 'Umar 
Ibn-al- Khattab who opened Jerusalem in 637 A.D.]. Holy 
Jerusalem is occupied and is an indivisible part of the 
territories occupied in 1967. All the states of the world 
approve this principle. They also approve the principle of 
withdrawal from the occupied territories in return for peace. 
  He said that regardless of the passage of time, there will 
be 
no abandonment of our holy Jerusalem, the capital of our 
independent state. There is no need for anyone to reassure us. 
With our own efforts, no matter how tiring they may be, our 
Jerusalem will remain for us. 
  On the rumors circulating regarding his health, the 
Palestinian leader said that he is well and in good health. It 
was a passing illness. He said: We will not pay attention to 
the hostile rumors. We must always try with all our efforts and 
with our people's very high ethics to turn the foes into 
helpers. We are a people with high ideals and we love everyone. 
Our honorable motives are to build our country. We extend our 
hand in peace to the whole world without exception. 
  Concluding, he said: How great are our Palestinian people 
with their ethics, morals, and struggle. How can I not be in 
good health when the people are with me and I am with them? I 
sincerely pray to God to enable me to do my best to serve this 
magnanimous people.

  [Excerpt] Brother Faysal al-Husayni, member of the 
Palestinian National Authority, yesterday said that the 
Palestinian leader, President Yasir 'Arafat, could arrive in 
Jericho at the end of this month. Al-Husayni added that 
'Arafat's arrival depends on the results of today's meeting 
between Palestinian officials and officials representing donor 
countries in Paris. 
  The donor countries have pledged over $2 billion to the 
Palestinian self-ruled areas over a period of five years, but so 
far only $5 million have come from the United States. The 
latter had promised to give $500 million. 
  In a statement to the press, al-Husayni said that he could 
not give a precise date for 'Arafat's arrival in Jericho, but 
added: I hope that this will be in the second half of this month. 
  In reply to a question on whether the timing of 'Arafat's 
arrival is linked to the conference of donor countries in Paris, 
al-Husayni said: There is a link of this kind. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The prime minister said this morning that Faysal 
al-Husayni would have to move to Jericho if he planned to run 
autonomy affairs. Surprisingly enough, Faysal al-Husayni did 
not reject the suggestion. Here is what he told Qol Yisra'el's 
English department correspondent Dick Winter: 
  [Begin recording] [Al-Husayni] I do not know if it was 
meant as a threat. In any event, if Mr. Rabin means that I 
should leave my home here and move to Jericho, I do not think it 
is a statement [preceding word in English] he should have made. 
  [Winter] What about your office? 
  [Al-Husayni] If he was referring to the offices, I have an 
office right here, where I conduct activities that are part of 
the peace process [preceding two words in English]. I will 
pursue that part which is not related only to the interim 
agreement. If, however, he was referring to activities 
pertaining to the Palestinian rule, then we can discuss the 
matter and see how to proceed. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Moti Amir] </F>
  [Excerpts] The drama that started when the Palestinians 
learned that 286 prisoners -- including 128 people who had 
served life terms -- would be released and transferred to the 
autonomy ended at the entrance to Jericho at daybreak. We have 
learned once again that agreements reached between Israel and 
the Palestinians are not implemented automatically. The 
prisoner release followed an understanding reached between 
Brigadier General Yom-Tov Sami' and General Ziyad al-Atrash, the 
leaders of the supreme liaison committee, but the Palestinian 
leadership in Judaea and Samaria complained about it to 'Arafat, 
claiming it violates the Cairo agreement. In response, 'Arafat 
fired Gen. al-Atrash, who is based in Gaza, and replaced him 
with Gen. 'Abd-al-Razzaq Yihya. 
  At the same time, the Palestinians in Jericho were told to 
block the roads and prohibit any of the freed prisoners from 
entering. The outcome was an inevitable confrontation between 
Israeli and Palestinian representatives at the Vered Yeriho 
junction, at the entry to the autonomy. The first bus with 18 
prisoners entered Jericho despite the roadblock, and the 
prisoners alighted at the Hanan camp, but the Palestinian 
policemen loaded them onto police vehicles and returned them to 
the regional liaison office. 
  Faysal al-Husayni, Jamil al-Tarifi, Sa'ib 'Urayqat, Jibril 
al-Rujub, and General al-Hajj Isma'il arrived at the site and 
informed the Israeli representatives that there was no 
agreement. Only those who had served life terms would enter 
Jericho, and the others would be sent to their homes, they said. 
They negotiated for some five hours at the entry to the 
regional liaison office at the Vered Yeriho junction, while 
approximately 270 prisoners waited on buses near Jericho and 
another 20 waited near the negotiators at the liaison office. 
  During the negotiations, telephone consultations were held 
with Deputy Chief of Staff Amnon Shahaq and the prisoners' 
leader in Nabulus prison. At daybreak, the Palestinians 
proposed a compromise whereby all the released prisoners would 
enter Jericho except for 13, who would be sent to their homes in 
Judaea and Samaria, on condition that Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin's bureau would send a reply within 48 hours to their 
request to meet with Rabin on this issue. The proposal was 
later accepted in a discussion with Major General Shahaq. 
Thirteen prisoners who did not serve life terms were sent to 
their homes in Judaea and Samaria, and the remainder entered 
Jericho. 
  At the conclusion of the extended negotiations, Colonel 
Herzl, a member of the liaison committee, said that to him this 
was not a compromise but the implementation of the agreement 
reached with the Palestinians. [passage omitted] 
  During the negotiations, the released prisoners pressured 
their leaders to make sure that they are not returned to jail. 
Although their proposal was accepted, the Palestinian leaders 
were far from pleased. 
  [Begin recording] [Amir] Are you satisfied? 
  [Al-Tarifi] No, I am not satisfied. 
  [Amir] Why? 
  [Al-Tarifi] Because they are cheating us. [end recording] 
  On the other hand, Faysal la-Husayni said they would uphold 
the agreement reached: 
  [Begin recording] [al-Husayni] There is an agreement. We 
will make sure that something good comes out of it. 
  [Amir] Do you hope to receive an answer from the prime 
minister within 48 hours? 
  [Al-Husayni] I hope that something good will come of it.

<F P=106> [Report by Muhammad 'Amirah in Jericho] </F>
  [Text] Jericho Mayor Jamil Sabri Khalaf has tendered his 
resignation to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat without 
stating the reasons. Although President 'Arafat rejected the 
resignation and asked Khalaf to remain in his post until general 
elections are held next month, Khalaf has decided to stay at 
home. 
  Lieutenant Colonel Munthir Irshayd, the Palestinian 
Administration official in Jericho, who was appointed to this 
position by 'Arafat after the implementation of the first phase 
of self-rule, has denied Israeli media reports about the arrest 
of the mayor. 
  In an exclusive statement to AL-DUSTUR, Irshayd said such 
Israeli rumors are part of Israel's psychological warfare and 
that the man (Khalaf) chose to stay at home without any coercion 
or pressure.

<F P=106> [Report by Salamah Ni'mat: "Al-Majali Reaffirms Jordan's </F>
`Displeasure' With 'Arafat's `Procrastination'; `Palestinian 
Golan' Obstructs Agreement Framework Between Syria and Israel"] 
  [Text] Amman -- Jordanian Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam 
al-Majali has stated that there is an "agreement of views" 
[tawafuq] between the United States and Syria on the "main 
lines" of a Syrian-Israeli agreement on the Golan Heights, and 
that what is obstructing the achievement of an agreement 
framework is a dispute over a strategic piece of land known as 
"the Palestinian Golan." Parliamentary sources have revealed to 
AL-HAYAH that al-Majali told the deputies in a closed session 
held the evening of the day before yesterday that "there is an 
agreement of views" between the United States and Syria on the 
main lines of a settlement, "but Israel still has reservations 
regarding al-Himmah triangle which Syria considers to be its 
own." The sources quoted al-Majali as saying that Syria "is 
requesting that the triangle be given back to it on the grounds 
that it had belonged to Syria since 1938." 
  Al-Majali said Egypt considers the triangle, known as "the 
Palestinian Golan," to belong to the Palestinians, and therefore 
negotiations on it should be between Israel and the PLO, 
according to parliamentary sources. Al-Himmah triangle is 
located at the point where the territories of Syria, Israel, and 
Jordan meet (north of the Jordanian kingdom). 
  Al-Majali also revealed that there is a border dispute 
between Jordan and Syria, and another dispute over water quotas, 
although he did say that relations are "at their best." 
  At the secret session of the House of Representatives, 
al-Majali also revealed that, during King Husayn's recent talks 
with President Hafiz al-Asad in Damascus, Syria asked of Jordan 
a level "higher than coordination" in their bilateral relations. 
The parliamentary sources interpreted the Syrian request as a 
call for some form of integration or unity. 
  The sources told AL-HAYAH that al-Majali told the deputies 
that the reply to Syria was briefly that Jordan "believes in 
coordination provided relations are not based just on slogans 
and emotions but rather on reason and a scientific approach." 
  He also said a Syrian delegation headed by Prime Minister 
Mahmud al-Zu'bi and including Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' 
will visit Amman on Saturday [11 June] for the meetings of the 
Syrian-Jordanian Higher Committee, which will be meeting for the 
first time since the Gulf crisis to discuss development of 
economic and political bilateral relations. 
  He told the deputies that Syrian-Jordanian relations are at 
their best, with the exception of "some problems" related to 
water quotas and border posts. The parliamentary sources said 
Jordan is still urging Syria to stop exceeding its share of 
water from al-Yarmuk River. 
  It is worth noting that Israel is also taking a part of 
Jordan's share in the Jordan and al-Yarmuk rivers. 
  The same sources said the border dispute is over a Syrian 
request to replace al-Ramtha border post with a border post in 
the area of Jabir on the border between the two countries. 
Jordan agrees to the introduction of a border post in Jabir, 
provided the border post at al-Ramtha remains. 
  The prime minister also said King Husayn contacted the 
Syrian 
president the day before yesterday, and the latter confirmed 
that the Syrian delegation will arrive in Amman on Saturday. 
  The sources quoted al-Majali as saying that the Syrians are 
still refusing to participate in the multilateral negotiations 
"to avoid discussion of the issue of water rights, particularly 
our rights to water controlled by Syria." 
  Reviewing Jordanian-Palestinian relations, al-Majali 
expressed Jordan's displeasure with Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat's procrastination, failure to coordinate with Jordan, 
and disregard for Jordanian interests. 
  The parliamentary sources also quoted al-Majali as saying 
that "we talk a lot about Palestinian coordination with Jordan, 
which we seek and hope for, but in practical terms it is 
nonexistent." He pointed out that the Palestinian coordination 
committees "come for a meeting every time his excellency 
President 'Arafat comes, and we explain the situation clearly 
and underline the seriousness of the matter for us both, and 
point out that coordination does not mean that we would lead or 
dominate them...." 
  He added: "We thought that, by virtue of our experience as a 
state, we were qualified to help and aid them in their affairs 
as they are about to build their own entity...but President 
'Arafat always insists on speaking in generalities, and he 
ignores details and the work of the (joint) committees." 
  Al-Majali added that when the PLO sent Ahmad Quray' 
(Abu-al-'Ala'), head of the PLO Economic Department, to Jordan 
with the aim of arriving at an economic agreement after the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement was signed in Paris; "an agreement 
was reached, but they postponed the signing...and that remains 
the case to this day." 
  He said that, in his view, what is going on now "is an 
attempt to drag (Jordan) along, in that the Israelis and the 
Palestinians reach agreement and then drag us along. We 
categorically reject that." 
  He added: "In the past, we excused them because their 
attention was focused on survival, symbols, and sovereignty and 
they had no time to discuss details...but at the latest meeting 
we told them that there will be no excuse after today and that 
we care about our own interests as they do about theirs...and 
that if we decided to work alone that would harm them more than 
it would harm us." 
  Commenting on al-Majali's statements, Deputy 'Abd-al-Karim 
al-Kabarati, speaking on behalf of some of his colleagues, said 
he supports the general policy of the government in its endeavor 
to protect Jordan and its interests "proceeding from constant 
Jordanian principles and adapting to regional and international 
changes and to the realities on the ground so that Jordan may 
continue to be a player and not become just a playground as its 
enemies want it to be." On Jordanian-Palestinian relations, 
al-Kabariti said "inasmuch as we are eager to save as much as we 
can of the elements of unity between the two banks (of the 
Jordan River), and although I believe that we should lay down 
the basis and rules for building future unitary relations 
between the two states, God willing, equally, we should not 
allow these genuine feelings to prevent us from carefully 
examing President Abu-'Ammar's ['Arafat's] policies and his 
extreme indulgence in tactics at the expense of strategy to the 
point of ignoring the historical and geographical facts which 
link our two peoples and countries, and even his clear 
insistence on moving in the opposite direction to these 
facts...." 
  Al-Kabariti urged the government "not to be embarrassed to 
talk about this matter in detail, and to let all the 
informational, political, and popular forces participate in a 
balanced and objective way. The public should be reassured that 
we resolutely and sincerely turn our attention to Palestine and 
its interests without the slightest interst in hegemony or 
control but without that undermining our determination, above 
all, to protect Jordan's interests, particularly its security, 
future, and economy, and without becoming captives of 
courtesies, meetings, and minutes which are the prevailing order 
these days." 
  Twenty deputies spoke during the closed session which lasted 
about three hours. They covered the various issues raised by 
the prime minister.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Step on a Long Road"] </F>
  [Text] The results of the tripartite 
Jordanian-U.S.-Israeli committee in Washington -- with regard to 
the Jordanian-Israeli talks -- are considered a step on a long 
road. This step could lead to achieving tangible progress in 
the peace process if the Israeli intentions are honest and if 
the Israeli leaders give momentum to the requirements of this 
process. 
  If these results can be seen as a turning point in a 
negotiating track that has lagged behind for several months, 
this will be a beginning surrounded by all kinds of dangers. At 
the front of these dangers is Israel's possible return to its 
traditional course known for its evasion of requirements, 
maneuvering over texts and words, and attempting to gain time. 
We still remember well those Israeli methods. 
  In light of all this, we must not be overoptimistic or 
propagate peace scenarios and bilateral or regional cooperation 
plans before everything becomes clear. That is, we must not be 
so before Israel rids itself of the mentality that it is the 
dominating force, and before it agrees on restoring all 
legitimate and recognized rights. 
  Therefore, we view the results of the tripartite meetings 
and 
the results they produced -- in terms of the agreement on a 
detailed agenda for the Jordanian-Israeli talks -- as a first 
step on a long way and the beginning for all possibilities, 
including positive possibilities. This will be achieved if 
Israel's intentions are honest and if the spirit of 
reconciliation and peace triumphs over the spirit of hegemony 
and military and ethical superiority.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said that today's 
stabbing in Jerusalem was not connected to the political changes 
happening in the region but was part of the ongoing war against 
murderous organizations which sought to kill Jews. These 
organizations tried to murder Jews in the past, are continuing 
to do so, and will pursue their attempts in the future, the 
prime minister told our correspondent Shmu'el Tal upon leaving a 
meeting of the Labor party bureau. Mr. Rabin nevertheless 
pointed out that in recent weeks, the number of terrorist 
attacks had dropped to a certain extent. 
  The prime minister said that Jordan was demonstrating a 
readiness to reach a peace treaty with Israel and this was 
greatly facilitating the negotiations between the two countries. 
The very discussion of the elements of a peace treaty was 
important in itself, Rabin said, and one should hope that within 
the framework of these efforts, steps would be taken to 
strengthen normalization between the two countries -- for 
example, with regard to free movement and the Elat-Egypt highway. 
  As for the negotiations with Syria, the prime minister said 
that the gaps between the parties' positions were still large 
and he did not expect a breakthrough or what he described as a 
miracle.

moderator Shlomo Ganor and political correspondent Eli Nisan on

  [Text] [Ganor] Good evening, Mr. Minister. Mr. Peres, 
upon the completion of the withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, 
would it be correct to say that we are at a crossroads in the 
political process? How should we proceed and what path should we 
take? 
  [Peres] I would only like to remind you that about nine or 
10 months ago nobody believed that the Gaza-Jericho matter would 
become a reality so quickly. After we reached the Oslo accord 
it was stated that the accord would be very difficult to 
implement in the area. We now have an agreement which was 
implemented in the area. So far -- God willing, as they say -- 
matters are working better than what we thought. 
  [Ganor] Where do we stand? 
  [Peres] We should continue now. We have four arenas: the 
Palestinian one--we should decide how to proceed on it; the 
Jordanian; the Syrian; and the entire Middle East. I know I 
have not mentioned Lebanon, but this is because I believe 
Lebanon can be discussed in the Syrian context only. 
  [Nisan] Mr. Peres, has the performance of the Palestinian 
Authority met the expectations from it so far? 
  [Peres] There were various expectations, but the majority 
thought it would not work at all. Yesterday I saw people who 
went through Jericho and said they simply could not believe 
their eyes. The police were there and order prevailed, and the 
same applies in Gaza. In my opinion, the main problem is an 
economic one. If the laborers from the territories are prepared 
to come here for work and knives are used for cutting bread 
rather than stabbing people, the situation in Gaza and Jericho 
can change at once. 
  [Ganor] This is in line with the World Bank demand that 
Israel lift the closure and enable the laborers to come to 
Israel for work, thus alleviating the economic distress. The 
question is whether you will recommend to the government that 
the closure be lifted. 
  [Peres] The closure is being lifted gradually and carefully. 
After all, the closure is not an Israeli caprice. This is a 
measure aimed at preventing the murder of people by laborers, 
including those who have worked at the same work place for 
years. If we realize that the opening of all gates to work does 
not involve danger, they will certainly be opened wide. 
  [Nisan] Mr. Peres, you noted the economic problem. The 
donor countries which pledged funds to the Palestinian Authority 
are not funneling them. The question is what role Israel plays 
here. Will Israel be willing to extend general and financial 
aid to this authority? 
  [Peres] Not only will Israel will be willing to do so, but 
it is doing so already. In fact, we paid about 20,000 wages in 
May in Gaza, and reference is not only to Civil Administration 
workers, but also to other work places, in order to relieve the 
distress caused by unemployment. This month we supplied 
medication for another three months. Licenses were issued to 
more than 10,000 laborers to come work in Israel. If all the 
other countries somewhat advance the implementation of their 
cash commitments, Israel will do the same. 
  [Nisan] Is Israel exercising its influence and moral power 
to get the European countries and international bodies to aid 
the Palestinian Authority? 
  [Peres] Absolutely. Participating in the discussions by the 
donor countries are the director general of the Foreign Ministry 
together with the person in charge of the territories. We will 
surely tell the donor countries what the practical needs are, 
and why it is important to act quickly and not leave a vacuum 
which can definitely endanger the implementation of the accord. 
  [Ganor] Mr. Peres, at a Labor faction meeting this week you 
warned that if the momentum in the negotiations with the 
Palestinians does not continue, the intifadah may erupt anew. 
When do you intend to start the negotiations on early 
empowerment for the Palestinians in Judaea and Samaria? 
  [Peres] I think all parties want to rest a little, 
particularly from unnecessary speeches. Look, there were two 
processes here. There was a practical process of introducing 
basic changes on the ground, and a verbal process which angered 
the entire world. We need the clouds of verbosity to disperse 
so that the change in the area can be observed, at which time I 
believe we will be able to resume the negotiations with the 
Palestinians. 
  [Ganor] The clouds of verbosity come from the other party: 
'Arafat's statements, for instance. 
  [Peres] Yes. He simply may not be aware of all the facts 
or, alternatively, he made totally unnecessary remarks. In 
Johannesburg he said, for example: Look, I am hesitant about 
signing. I hesitated because I was not prepared to sign before 
I received a letter on the Jerusalem issue. In Cairo he was not 
given any letter on the Jerusalem issue. Our denial was true 
and genuine. No negotiations over this took place in Cairo. We 
did not know then that he was referring to Holst's letter. 
Holst's letter was written much earlier. Cairo was not 
necessary for that. 
  [Ganor] However, for all practical purposes, Mr. Peres, 
you are already starting the Jerusalem segment of our program. 
What is the attitude of Israeli officials in Jerusalem toward 
the Palestinian declarations that East Jerusalem will ultimately 
become the capital of the Palestinian state? 
  [Peres] We regard this as mere dreaming, not reality. Look, 
we cannot forbid people to dream, we cannot stop people from 
talking. However, in my opinion -- and we have also told the 
Palestinians this -- we are very adamant about our position. 
Jerusalem will not be redivided. It will not be a Berlin. We 
shall establish neither barriers nor walls there. A city can 
only be the capital of one country. One cannot have two 
capitals in one city because that would mean a division of 
Jerusalem. It is the historical capital of Israel and Israel's 
capital today. We added that we have no intention of harming 
the Palestinian residents of Jerusalem or their existing 
institutions. In summation, I would say that in the political 
sense, the issue of Jerusalem is closed and it will remain the 
united capital of Israel, whereas from the religious aspect it 
will remain an open, spiritual center for the three monotheistic 
religions. 
  [Ganor] What should the Palestinians watching our program 
understand from your reply? 
  [Peres] That everything is open from the religious aspect. 
We will respect every sentiment, every prayer, and every 
religious need. We will not sacrifice Jerusalem to radical 
political plans. One should recall that throughout all of 
history, Jerusalem was never an Arab capital and one should also 
recall that the Jewish people never had any other capital but 
Jerusalem. 
  [Ganor] Mr. Peres, which steps does the Israeli Government 
intend to take in order to maintain the current status quo in 
East Jerusalem and prevent it from being undermined by the other 
side? 
  [Peres] We have made ourselves very clear. The Palestinian 
Authority must handle autonomy-related affairs from Jericho. We 
will not countenance any transfer of institutions from Jericho 
to Jerusalem. This violates the agreement and the nature of 
Jerusalem. 
  [Ganor] Are we talking about legislative steps, orders, or 
limitations on some people who are members of the Palestinian 
Authority in order to prevent them from establishing 
representations in Jerusalem? 
  [Peres] If people uphold the law, then no other laws will be 
necessary. The existing laws are sufficient. First, we expect 
them to uphold the existing laws. For example, there is no room 
for Palestinian police in East Jerusalem. There is only one 
police force, one army, and one government. Educational, 
religious, and medical institutions, on the other hand, could 
definitely be permitted. 
  [Ganor] But these were not the institutions the government 
was referring to when it said it would enact legislation to 
prevent any changes to the status quo in East Jerusalem. 
  [Peres] We are now looking into the issue. If the status 
quo has been broken, which is apparently the case here and 
there, we will examine whether these breaches can be rectified 
through existing laws or whether additional legislation is 
called for. The issue is still not clear. It may very well be 
that any deviations from the law may be rectified through the 
use of existing legislation and no new laws are necessary. 
  [Ganor] Mr. Peres, the issue of Jerusalem, at least 
according to the reports, was the main bone of contention. Two 
days before the signing of the Oslo agreement, 'Arafat almost 
refused to sign. 
  [Peres] One day before, yes. 
  [Ganor] A day before. What happened? How was 'Arafat 
persuaded that he could concede on the issue of Jerusalem? 
  [Peres] Look, from the very beginning we said that we were 
offering the Gaza Strip plus Jericho. This, in order to 
establish the administrative institutions of the Palestinian 
autonomy in Jericho. We said that on no account would we ever 
agree to the establishment of these institutions in Jerusalem. 
On that dramatic night in Stockholm when we were constantly on 
the telephone with Tunisia, I explained very forcefully to them 
that it was either Jericho or no agreement. That was their 
choice. On the other hand, we stated what I am saying now as 
well. All the existing insitutions in Jerusalem will be 
preserved. We have no intention of harming people or 
institutions. We do not wish to offend their dignity or 
sensitivities either. I made a clear promise to that effect. 
  [Ganor] Does raising the Jerusalem issue at this stage not 
expedite the discussion of the permanent arrangement? 
  [Peres] No, not at all. Whoever proposes discussing the 
permanent arrangement now is actually perpetualizing the 
conflict. Let us say we start discussions on the permanent 
arrangement and they raise the issue of Jerusalem. I cannot see 
where an agreement can provide a solution with regard to the 
issue of Jerusalem, certainly not today. If you want to 
highlight the fact that we cannot reach agreement then this is 
possible. But what is the point? I would like to say that 
today the problem is more one of relations than borders. Some 
people think that if we demarcate borders then relations will 
improve. I think that if we establish a new relationship then 
we will be able to demarcate the future borders. Let us take 
the example of Hebron. There are 120,000 Arabs and 500 Jews in 
Hebron. Would this be a problem if relations were good? In 
Ma'alot Tarshiha there are both Jewish and Arab communities. Is 
there any problem there? Are there any problems in Yafo or in 
Haifa? Arabs and Jews can therefore live together when they 
have a different relationship. What we all should be doing now 
is improving relations so that neither side is afraid of the 
other. Therefore, we should also watch what we are saying. 
Today, people want barriers and barbed wire fences. That is no 
way to live or to maintain peace. We need understandings and we 
need to prove that human beings can live together even if they 
belong to different peoples. 
  [Ganor] Mr. Peres, with regard to your letter to the 
Norwegian foreign minister, some people say that the very fact 
that a letter was sent to the PLO grants the PLO a position of 
patronage and preeminence in East Jerusalem at the expense of 
other Islamic and Christian elements. 
  [Peres] First, the PLO is not mentioned in my letter. The 
word PLO is not mentioned. That is the reason I wrote it to the 
late Norwegian Foreign Minister Holst and not to 'Arafat, 
although the contents of the letter are not secret and can be 
made known to everyone. This is to demonstrate that the 
Jerusalem issue had not been decided, let us say, in favor of 
'Arafat. Nothing of the sort was decided. We know that the 
Jordanians are sensitive about the Waqf. We will not take any 
religious authorities from Jordan and give them to another 
party. We have no intention of changing the status quo to the 
benefit or the detriment of anybody. We will neither intervene 
nor meddle in inter-Arab relations. 
  [Ganor] In order to end the chapter on Jerusalem, which will 
certainly be discussed further in the future, let me ask you if 
the Israeli Government will accede to Yasir 'Arafat's request to 
visit Jerusalem if he indeed submits such a request? 
  [Peres] Leave something for a future interview. Why should 
we answer all the questions now? No such request has been 
submitted and I therefore cannot give you an answer. 
  [Ganor] But in principle? 
  [Peres] We will discuss the matter in principle when it is 
put to the test. 
  [Ganor] With your permission sir, let us move on to Jordan, 
the second topic of discussion we posited at the beginning of 
our program. Can the understandings reached during this week's 
talks in Washington between Jordan and Israel be viewed as an 
opening toward the reaching of a peace treaty between the two 
countries? 
  [Peres] Definitely. I think that significant progress has 
been made although obstacles can still be raised. After all, 
any child can see the necessity of peace with Jordan. The 
possibility of reaching this peace is also evident. One does 
not need a telescope to see this as well as the fact that the 
time has come and that both the Jordanians and the Israelis will 
greatly benefit from peace. The entire Syrian-African Rift -- 
and I keep on saying this -- between Lake Tiberias and Elat, 
instead of being a wasteland of hatred and separation can become 
a fertile valley supplying jobs to thousands of workers from 
both sides of the Jordan River, both Jordanians and Israelis. 
We can attract hundreds of millions of dollars in investments 
for water desalination plants, tourism ventures, agriculture. 
There are extraordinary plans and companies are interested in 
investing. I heard the Jordanian information minister say that 
Jordan would not miss the train. We feared that the Syrians 
were holding them back. If the Syrians do not hold them back 
then there are no hindrances to Jordanian-Israeli relations. I 
keep on saying this. We told the Jordanians that we can discuss 
borders and water issues if they are serious about peace. If 
they seriously intend to reach peace then the time has come to 
do what is necessary for the benefit of both peoples and peace. 
  [Ganor] Mr. Peres, in light of your remarks and in light of 
the agreements and understandings reached with the Jordanians 
this week at the committees and economic talks, do you expect 
Jordan and Israel to sign a peace treaty in the coming year? 
  [Peres] I do not want to commit myself to dates. I do not 
expect anything; I merely act. I cannot tell you what will 
happen. Things do not happen by themselves. As a representative 
of the Israeli public and a cabinet minister, I can state that 
we have to act continuously and resolutely to release the 
citizens of both Jordan and Israel from this artificial state of 
war. There is no need or foundation for this. It is a total 
waste of time. The sooner we achieve it, the greater service we 
will have done our peoples, and it is a pity that things have 
been put off for so long. 
  [Ganor] If not peace, do you anticipate at least a 
normalization in relations with Jordan in the near future? 
  [Peres] The difference between normal relations and peace is 
not great. Peace means normalization. What else is 
normalization? But you know, I am a practical man and we must 
welcome everything that promotes peace. 
  [Ganor] What is behind Amman's dramatic change over the last 
week? Was it a green light from Damascus? 
  [Peres] I cannot tell you. I was not at the meeting between 
President al-Asad and King Husayn. They may also have concluded 
that progress is possible and each party should act 
independently. One must also take into account the 
implementation of the agreement with the PLO on the Gaza Strip 
and Jericho. There is also something that I have been saying 
all the time: we are a three-sided triangle. No side should 
act against the others. It is better that we work together as a 
triangle, at least in the economic sense. On numerous occasions 
I proposed that we cooperate together on economic issues in a 
Benelux-style arrangement, that is, economic cooperation between 
three countries. Politically, we should act as two separate 
entities: a Palestinian-Jordanian entity and an Israeli entity. 
  [Ganor] But Jordan rejected your idea to host an 
international economic conference in Amman? 
  [Peres] Jordan says that it rejected the proposed date, not 
the idea itself. Now Jordan has announced that it has adopted 
my conference proposal but at a later date. The Jordanians 
claimed that if the conference was held before progress in the 
negotiations then the world would get the impression that Jordan 
could be bought with a conference. Some kind of payoff. I do 
not subscribe to this view. I think that this conference was 
not held with the intention of buying off anyone but rather to 
build things. I think that such a conference would have 
facilitated, not held up, the negotiations. 
  [Ganor] Would it not compete with the conference that you 
and King Hassan last Friday agreed to hold in Morocco? 
  [Peres] Yes, it is now understood that the second 
international conference--if such a conference is indeed held in 
Jordan--will take place at the beginning of 1995. The 
conference in Morocco is scheduled for the end of October or the 
beginning of November. After a year, or nine months, it can be 
continued in Jordan. 
  [Ganor] Still, Saudi Arabia is creating obstacles to the 
entire issue of lifting the anti-Israel boycott. 
  [Peres] Saudi Arabia is beginning to be problematic. We 
still remember how Saudi Ambassador to the United States Bandar 
arrived in New York to meet with Jews, to tell them that Saudi 
Arabia is peace-oriented, that if settlements cease and the 
Palestinians are recognized, then certain things will follow. 
To my great regret, a delay occurred in, say, Saudi support for 
peace. At the meeting of the working group in Qatar recently, 
on arms control -- on supervising the level of armament and on 
disarmament -- the Saudis were totally negative. 
  [Ganor] Did Israel or the United States chastise the Saudis 
about this? 
  [Peres] What do you mean by chastising? We say this to the 
Americans too. The Saudis may be angry at the Gulf emirates 
which do not abide by the Arab Peninsula's discipline and the 
like, but it is very difficult for us to decipher Saudi Arabia's 
conduct. Saudi Arabia needs to decide whether it wants or 
opposes peace. If it opposes peace, we will reach our 
conclusions. It is not us who threatens Saudi Arabia. Saudi 
Arabia knows precisely who threatens it. In general, many Arab 
countries know that if there is any threat, it emanates from 
Teheran, not from Jerusalem. If Saudi Arabia wants chaos in the 
Middle East, of continued wars, of a continued arms race, it can 
surely conduct a negative policy, but it is about time it 
decides where it is heading. 
  [Ganor] Mr. Peres, what do you learn from the Syrian 
position about its readiness to break the deadlock on the 
Israeli-Syrian track? Is there a change in the Syrian position 
on the eve of Warren Christopher's possible arrival in the 
region this month? 
  [Peres] I would not say that a breakthrough has been 
achieved yet. Look, if Syria truly wants a normalization of 
relations, it should start with normalization in contacts. 
Again, desiring high-level meetings, of heads of state or 
ministers, is not an Israeli caprice. The point is that our 
people are very skeptical about what Syria truly wants. Nobody 
doubts that Syria wants the Golan Heights back, but is Syria 
truly prepared to go for acceptable security arrangements? Is 
Syria truly prepared to give peace without tricks, without 
additions or deletions? There is a doubt here, and it is 
incumbent on the Syrian leaders to appear publicly and openly in 
the negotiations with us so as to reach results. 
  Let me tell you, the negotiations we held with the PLO were 
very difficult. They were difficult both for them and for us. 
Take that night in Cairo, for example: The Israeli delegation 
-- the prime minister, the foreign minister, army people, and 
others -- was convened in one room; the 'Arafat-led PLO 
delegation sat in a second room; and President Mubarak, 'Amr 
Musa, Warren Christopher and his aides, sat in a third room. It 
was possible then to move from one room to another and smooth 
things out, surmount obstacles, and come up with creative 
solutions at moments of crisis, and it was that night which 
enabled the negotiations to emerge from their infancy and assume 
adulthood. It is impossible to conduct negotiations by 
exchanging formal opinions constantly. After all, formally 
speaking, we do not have an agreement: We and they want 
different things, so how are the differences bridged? They are 
first bridged through meetings and negotiations by those who are 
allowed to put up the bridge. In my opinion then, there are two 
types of discussions. There is a discussion on contents, and 
there is a discussion on method [last word in English]. It is 
the method at least which should be changed. If one wants a 
normalization in relations, one needs a normalization in 
contacts, in negotiations. 
  [Ganor] Over the past two weeks, since the secretary of 
State's visit to the region, was there a short circuit between 
Jerusalem and Damascus, or has Washington engaged in contacts 
through diplomatic channels in an attempt to build the bridge 
you are discussing? 
  [Peres] I believe that Washington constantly tries to 
establish a bridgehead, on the Syrian side as well as on ours, 
and I think it is this which decides the date of Christopher's 
visits to the region. In other words, he wants to come when he 
has enough cement in his hand to start building some bridgehead. 
  [Ganor] Does he have cement in his hand then? 
  [Peres] Not enough, in my opinion. 
  [Ganor] Have U.S. proposals been conveyed to both sides over 
the last two weeks? 
  [Peres] No, I do not think so. Nor do I think the Americans 
want to act this way. They are very cautious. They do not want 
to appear as people who impose their opinion on others. 
  [Ganor] Do you expect the United States to increase its 
involvement, perhaps in the future, if no solution is found on 
the Syrian-Israeli track? 
  [Peres] I believe in the sincerity and seriousness of the 
United States. I really believe that just like Israel it seeks 
a comprehensive peace in the Middle East. Therefore, Washington 
will not cease its efforts. The frequency of these contacts and 
of the shuttle diplomacy also depend on the reactions of both 
sides. 
  [Ganor] Are the gaps between the positions of both sides 
still large? 
  [Peres] There is still a gap between the positions of both 
sides in all three domains. 
  [Ganor] Nevertheless, the Jordanian prime minister was this 
week quoted as saying that Syria and Israel had reached an 
understanding in principle and the only things left open were 
the period over which the withdrawal would stretch and the 
abrogation of the Golan Law. You know Dr. al-Majali. Are you 
prepared to comment on this? 
  [Peres] Look, it is apparently easier for every prime 
minister to be optimistic with regard to other countries. Let 
us concentrate on the Jordanian track in the negotiations with 
Jordan and on Syria with the Syrians. 
  [Ganor] What can we expect from the secretary of State's 
impending visit? 
  [Peres] The continuation of the attempts to lay a bridgehead 
between the two parties. 
  [Ganor] You do not like predicting dates, but you always 
said that the window of opportunity was either closing or 
opening. Can we expect a breakthrough in the negotiations with 
Syria in 1994? 
  [Peres] I said that the window of opportunity was about to 
close with regard to the dates. I never gave dates for windows 
to open. Let me explain what I mean by this. Elections are 
scheduled to be held in Israel in November 1996. One can assume 
that the country will be in an uproar one year ahead of that, 
primaries and arguments, and the Norwegian Law [reference to a 
law stipulating that cabinet ministers lose their Knesset seats 
in order to permit their faction to increase its size]. We are 
already in the middle of 1994, with the grace of God. 
Politically speaking, we have one year or 15 months to operate 
at the most. Everyone can see that and that is the window of 
opportunity that is closing. The possibility to take political 
action without running smack into pre-election turmoil. Now, I 
believe that within that period it is possible, but I cannot 
promise that it will happen, to move on to a second stage in the 
negotiations with the Palestinians and make significant progress 
in the negotiations with Jordan, which are crucial in my view. 
If there is a breakthrough with Syria, I will be very pleased. 
  [Ganor] Let us end our program on this optimistic note. 
Thank you for being with us, Mr. Foreign Minister.

<F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Eytan Rabin] </F>
  [Excerpts] An alert was declared yesterday along the 
northern border and in south Lebanon following resumed exchanges 
of fire between the terrorists and the IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] and SLA [South Lebanese Army]. At the same time, there 
is no intention of reinforcing the army along the border and 
inside Lebanon, although the alert is being maintained. 
[passage omitted] 
  Sources in the defense establishment said yesterday that 
mainly Hizballah is responsible for the shooting yesterday, 
although it may be that other organizations took part in the 
activity against the IDF. Army sources stressed that Hizballah 
has quickly recovered from the air raid on the organization's 
camp in Ba'labakk last week and resumed activity in the security 
zone. This activity is comprised of firing katyushas, as well 
as placing roadside bombs, remote-control explosive charges, and 
trip wire charges. 
  IDF soldiers have been instructed to intensify patrols in 
the 
coming period in view of possible attempts by Hizballah 
terrorist squads to infiltrate into the security zone. Major 
General Yitzhaq Mordekhay, commander of the Northern Command, 
yesterday stressed that, despite the resumption of the firing of 
katyushas last week and yesterday, the terrorists have not 
violated the agreements made at the close of Operation 
Accountability last year. It is assumed that U.S. and Syrian 
pressure made Hizballah stop firing katyushas at Israel last 
week. At the same time, an IDF Intelligence Branch source said 
recently that it is not inevitable that the firing of katyushas 
at the northern settlements will resume. [passage omitted] 
  [Tel Aviv 'AL-HAMISHMAR in Hebrew on 9 June carries on page 
2 
a report by Aharon Klein and Betzal'el 'Amiqam citing remarks by 
Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur at the Knesset yesterday, 
during a discussion of the events on the northern border. Gur 
said: "The message the Syrians have received over the last two 
weeks is that they have no chance of closing the qualitative gap 
between us. If they consider going back on the peace process, 
they will know what they are faced with." Gur is further cited 
as saying that "we will not accept terror, not even if it is 
supported by Syria, and it is important that the Syrians know 
this."]

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Rumors spread through 
Jerusalem last night that Prime Minister Rabin had recently met 
with Jordan's King Husayn. This followed a report broadcast on 
Israel's second television channel that the two leaders last 
week held talks in Washington. When later asked by reporters if 
a meeting with King Husayn took place, Rabin responded: I did 
not meet him this week. Sources close to the prime minister 
refused to deny or confirm the report. The Prime Minister's 
Office would not comment on the matter. Sources in Washington 
said Rabin had not been in the United States since last March. 
  Meanwhile, the office of Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has 
denied claims that he met King Husayn earlier this month in 
Europe. Knesset Member Ra'anan Kohen raised the question two 
days ago in the Knesset.

<F P=106> [Interview with 'Allamah Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah by Rif'at </F>
Sayyid Ahmad in Beirut's southern suburb; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Ahmad] The Arab and Islamic situation is now 
experiencing changes and events, especially in light of 
developments in the Arab-Zionist conflict. What is your general 
assessment of this situation in light of these changes? 
  [Fadlallah] When we discuss the negotiations that seek to 
end 
this conflict, we note a prominent, vital point in these 
negotiations. This point is that there is an Israeli decision 
in line with a U.S. decision, and which is encouraged by the 
United States, to turn the Arab world into one bloc that does 
not react to any Zionist action or any Western interests, 
especially those of the United States. The aim is to change the 
term "Arab moderation" into "Arab capitulation." They are 
trying to minimize its effect and express it in terms in line 
with the new world order because the Arabs want to incorporate 
themselves into this order. 
  Thus, we have noticed that Zionism, in coordination with the 
United States, worked to humiliate the Palestinian negotiator 
and exhaust the Palestinian people during the negotiations 
phase. This caused political confusion to the negotiators, who 
accepted the negotiations as a transitional measure that will 
eventually lead to an Arab regime lacking the structure of a 
state. This regime, which does not enjoy the people's support, 
will join all other Arab regimes that suffer separation between 
their officials and peoples. This will create complexities for 
the self-rule officials as soon as the rule begins touching off 
political and security disorder in which they will be unable to 
adjust to the experiment that Israel said it will monitor prior 
to deciding its stance on subsequent self-rule negotiations. 
  Israel will work to benefit from all contradictions in the 
arena and will use them to cause political and security chaos in 
the Palestinian situation. Israel will tell the world that the 
Palestinian people are not qualified to govern themselves. 
Therefore, we must know that there is a plan to cause confusion 
for the Palestinians through the negotiations and that there is 
a plan to humiliate the Palestinian man who will move to strike 
out and kill. In such a situation, massacres will be committed 
in the Palestinian arena and daily killings will occur without 
any U.S. response except general talk about mutual violence. 
  On the other hand, we notice that the jihad operations 
carried out by Islamist Palestinians have attracted much 
attention from U.S. officials to the extent that they deal with 
'Arafat based on his rejection of these operations. They want 
'Arafat's rejection to be expressed in harsh words and strong 
denunciation, not just regret, when the United States is 
satisfied with just expressing regret for all massacres of 
Muslims committed by the Jews. 
  We notice that the Israelis--with encouragement from the 
United States--are working to demoralize the Palestinians so 
that they will not contemplate any rejectionist stance as a 
prelude to demoralizing the Arab and Islamic spirit. It is in 
this context that we view Zionism's handling of the question of 
ties with Syria which still stands with considerable 
steadfastness through its demands countering the Israeli demands. 
  We notice that Israel sought to empty the Geneva summit of 
every substantial point that would give Syria moral strength in 
the view of the U.S. public and administration and we notice 
that Israel is seeking through its statements to humiliate the 
Syrian position. 
  From this quick review, we can deduce a political fact in 
the political reality and the negotiations, namely that the 
negotiations must result in the submission of the Arab spirit to 
the Israeli character by imposing all sorts of political and 
security pressures on the Arab arena so that the Arab will have 
no choice but to say no to war and yes to all the morale-sapping 
stands required of him. 
  In view of this, we believe that the Islamists -- who are 
aware of their nation's issues of freedom through their belief 
in one God and in freedom for all forces in the universe -- are 
the ones confirming the movement of freedom through their jihad 
activities, their political belief, and all their actions that 
aim to restore vigor to the nation in one way or another. 
  [Ahmad] Moving on to the Lebanese file, I have noticed 
several internal political developments in Lebanese life since 
my arrival in Beirut, including the opening of the old Christian 
files. In light of your experience and your role in Beirut, do 
you believe that what is happening now is a sign that Lebanon's 
health has been restored following the reconciliation, or is it 
the start of a new stage in the internal struggles? 
  [Fadlallah] I believe that there is a point that we must 
stress, namely that the harsh or lenient Lebanese decisions made 
in the domestic arena, which are influenced by more than one 
foreign side, do not stem from a purely internal Lebanese 
reality. Even the issue of rebuilding the state, which is a 
popular demand made by all Lebanese people, came as a result of 
foreign decisions which had unleashed the war in Lebanon by 
exploiting the Lebanese contradictions inside the country. They 
were the ones that brought about peace when war stopped being of 
any use or benefit to this international party or that regional 
one. Therefore, there is a decision made through the al-Ta'if 
accord which is wholly American, though it is under an Arab 
umbrella and has Lebanese signatures. It was American-born but 
was implemented by the Arabs. The al-Ta'if accord includes the 
rebuilding of Lebanon in its calculations. The U.S. plan is 
this: to eliminate the French influence which is active to a 
great extent within the Maronite and Christian ranks and 
possibly within some Islamic ranks that are appendages to 
political Maronism. 
  The U.S. policy is to sweep away the French influence from 
its positions, even as some of the latter are opening their eyes 
to the new U.S. atmosphere. There is a French need for 
influence that finds an advanced position for itself in 
Christianity and specifically Maronism, through which it can 
implement its policy by exploiting sectarian emotions. 
Therefore, I believe that the plan is to rebuild the state in a 
way that will establish U.S. influence in Lebanon. The United 
States is planning Lebanon's future in a way that will make it 
part of the future regional order and therefore there will be a 
country that has the power to oppose any European, Islamic, or 
Arab influence. 
  This is the plan. It is not the signal of a new phase in 
sharp internal Lebanese instability that leads the country to 
war because we believe that the intra-Lebanese war is over 
because it is of no use any more to any international or 
regional party and is not locally possible because the Lebanese 
have exhausted all their energies in the war. 
  [Ahmad] Turning to political issues, the region, including 
Lebanon of course, is being groomed for the so-called Middle 
East market which, we believe, stands for finalizing greater 
Israel. The word "market" is misleading and does not stand for 
the truth. What is your assessment of that concept and the 
general schemes associated with it? 
  [Fadlallah] I cannot confirm the issue of greater Israel. 
First; judging by the nature of the political, economic, and 
social climate being prepared for the region, the next stage 
does not give Israel more than it is already taking from the 
Arab-Israeli conciliation. Second; monitoring America's 
actions, we see that it is trying to adjust the area to its 
wishes, so that nothing passes unless it goes through America. 
Even if Israel can afford to put some pressure on the U.S. 
Administration in the Arab-Israeli conflict, we know that it 
cannot exert such pressure when it comes to the American-Israeli 
economic conflict. In other words, the Zionist lobby cannot 
pressure the American administration into making concessions to 
Israel. What can happen is the facilitation of Israeli 
transactions in parallel with American ones. 
  America seeks a free hand in the oil-rich areas. If it is 
trying to preclude any European, Russian, Japanese, or Chinese 
role in oil-related matters, how can it make Israel a partner? 
Israel, for its part, is planning a partnership with Europe and 
America in that field. Therefore, I believe that the issue of a 
Greater Israel is a finished dream. 
  There is another matter, however. Raising the issue of the 
Middle East as a substitute for the Arab world derives from 
plans to establish Israel as a natural member of the region. 
Normally, Israel could not be part of a region made up of 
Arabs. But if that region is turned into a Middle East, Israel 
can be part of it. This is particularly true when we realize 
that there is a future plan to divide the regional security 
system into sections, with Turkey and Israel in the forefront, 
giving Arabs a role inferior to that of Turkey and 
disproportionate to the size of Arabs at the international 
level. This is what makes us think that we have to undertake a 
careful study of the region's economic market -- the water 
economy, the oil economy, and the agricultural and industrial 
economy -- against the American-European dispute concerning the 
export of consumer or military goods to the Arab world. 
  Monitoring the future, we have to see economic matters in 
their strategic perspective; whereas security-wise, we have to 
view the future in light of the confrontation with the Islamic 
inclination or the difficult conflicts involving native or 
national movements that reality generates. 
  We also have to monitor the new plan America might work out 
by encircling the Islamic Republic of Iran through a Middle East 
steered by the American strategy that is open to other 
strategies in the region. 
  [Ahmad] Are we content with the role of bystander or do you 
have a specific vision of this confrontation? 
  [Fadlallah] We talk about monitoring because we are trying 
to 
analyze reality and future prospects. But in the meantime, we 
are not neutral regarding that reality. As Islamists, we seek 
to revive the Islamic inclination by all means possible. We 
have our own rational and diligent study that measures reality 
against objectives to distort that American-Israeli plan. As 
Islamists, we proceed on the basis of integration with 
pan-Arabists, that is if they are determined to free the Arab 
political, security, and economic aspects from the American fist 
and if they have not already sunk in the dreams America is 
trying to make them live by using words like moderation and so 
on. 
  I believe that we have to relate with nationalists, 
pan-Arabists, and even with the Marxists who adopt a creed 
different from ours. [passage omitted] 
  [Ahmad] A final word by Your Eminence to your readers in 
Egypt. 
  [Fadlallah] As I speak about the great Islamic homeland in 
Egypt, I tell all our kinsfolk, brothers, and fellow citizens 
that they should preserve Egypt as a strength for Arabs, 
Muslims, and Africa and as a source of strength for anyone who 
seeks freedom and justice. 
  We believe that the Egyptian nation is one of the best and 
most honest, open and loving nations. We do not count on the 
regime--any regime--to stand against this intelligence game but 
believe that, with its Islamic awareness, Christian openness, 
and originality, the Egyptian nation will foil this intelligence 
game. 
  We want to say to the Egyptians--the regime and people--that 
the regime will not benefit from this kind of bloodshed, neither 
now nor in the future because the international ploy does not 
want this nation to be stable. God has urged us to argue our 
cases in an amicable way, to promote the cause of God with 
wisdom and friendly advice, to act with goodness to turn our 
enemies into friends, to be patient over our differences and 
problems to know how to reconcile our differences and solve our 
problems. 
  We are sad, very sad, about what is happening in Egypt and 
do 
not believe that the Islamists mean harm to Egypt or to its 
people. Perhaps some people differ with them over certain 
methods and concepts but we can only say that they are loyal to 
the Egyptian people and the Islamic cause. We remind the 
Egyptians of what Imam 'Ali said about the renegades and we do 
not want to talk about the Islamists as renegades or talk about 
the regime this way. We are not in the habit of characterizing 
people but we seek the idea: "Do not fight the renegades for 
their mistakes because anyone who seeks right and errs is not 
like one who seeks and does what is wrong." 
  If you claim that the Islamists are wrong--indeed, some of 
them use the wrong methods for rightful ends--try to initiate a 
broad and the best kind of dialogue to caution them about what 
is wrong if there is anything and in this case their Islamic 
origins will lead them to retreat from the wrong if they are 
convinced. Those who believe that the state's engagement in 
dialogue means a loss of prestige for the state are mistaken, 
because the state's prestige is commensurate with the protection 
it offers to its people and its persuading them to integrate 
with it. 
  I ask all our regimes: You have fought wars against Israel 
that destroyed your economy, security, and policy and are now 
talking about peace with the Jews who are the fiercest enemies 
of the believers but why don't you talk about peace with the 
Muslims who believe in God, His messenger, and the world 
hereafter? They might err in their interpretations and methods 
but they were not wrong in testifying that there is no god but 
God, that Muhammad is his messenger, that the Koran and the 
world hereafter are true, and that anyone who does not care for 
Muslims is not a Muslim. 
  Come to common agreement with the Muslims, come to common 
agreement with people of other religions, come to common terms 
with all the oppressed who seek freedom against all arrogant 
people.

<F P=106> [News conference by Mohammad Kazem Khonsari, director </F>
general of Middle East and North African affairs in the Iranian 
Foreign Ministry, with unidentified correspondents after his 
meeting with Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri in Beirut on 8 June 
-- recorded] 
  [Text] [Khonsari] In the name of God, the compassionate, 
the merciful. Within the framework of my meetings with senior 
officials in this fraternal country over the past two days, this 
morning I met with His Excellency Prime Minister Rafiq 
al-Hariri. After conveying condolences to the martyrs of the 
recent massacre during the barbaric Zionist aggression against 
Lebanon, we discussed regional and international issues, and 
bilateral relations. We agreed on the need to expand and deepen 
bilateral relations and joint cooperation in various spheres. 
  Regarding developments and events in the region, especially 
the repeated attacks by the Zionist enemy on Lebanon, our views 
were completely identical. We agreed that the Zionist enemy 
cannot influence Lebanese policy or the resistance by the 
Lebanese sons through attacks, threats, and evil acts. The 
resistance is fully supported by the Lebanese Government. If 
the Israeli attacks and threats have any effect, it is only to 
strengthen the unity and cohesiveness of the Lebanese people and 
Lebanese Government in their steadfastness against the Zionist 
enemy. This was stated by His Excellency Prime Minister Rafiq 
al-Hariri who said: We support the resistance. Resistance is 
the Lebanese people's legitimate right and the government will 
support it. 
  [Correspondent] We are grateful that you have helped 
Lebanon. 
There are reports that there were Iranian victims among those 
killed in the Israeli raid on a Hizballah position in the 
Ba'labakk area. Are these reports true? 
  [Khonsari] This is not true at all. This is the first time 
that I have heard that. 
  [Correspondent] Is there any new information about the fate 
of the abducted Iranians? 
  [Khonsari] I have no knowledge of this. Of course, we expect 
the Lebanese Government to pursue the right course and follow up 
on the fate of these hostages, particularly as they were Iranian 
diplomats kidnapped on this land. We have no accurate knowledge 
of their fate. The entire Iranian people and Iranian 
Government, certainly the families of these brothers, are always 
waiting to hear positive news about the fate of these brothers 
and the necessary measures to free them. 
  [Correspondent] President Hashemi-Rafsanjani says that the 
abducted Iranians are in Israel? 
  [Khonsari] One possibility is that they are alive and 
prisoners of the Zionist enemy. 
  [Correspondent] Are there plans for you to conclude 
agreements on developing bilateral relations with the Lebanese 
Government? 
  [Khonsari] We, the Islamic Republic of Iran, are ready to 
have comprehensive cooperation in all the spheres that Lebanon 
desires. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you.

  [Text] Commenting on [U.S. Secretary of State] 
Christopher's expected return to the region within the framework 
of the U.S. Administration resuming its efforts to invigorate 
the Syrian-Israeli track, informed Syrian sources emphasize that 
since the Madrid conference -- not to mention the Geneva summit, 
where Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton reached 
understanding and agreement on activating the process for 
comprehensive peace -- Syria has welcomed every U.S. effort to 
invigorate the peace process. 
  The sources told Radio Monte Carlo that Israeli statements 
after Christopher left the region, particularly Rabin's 
statements that the negotiations on the Syrian and Lebanese 
tracks are frozen, mean that Israel does not welcome the U.S. 
secretary of state's return to the region, and that Israel, 
through its statements, appears to be dictating to the U.S. 
sponsor how to act and move in the peace process. 
  The sources held Israel responsible for the delay and the 
stagnation in the peace process, and said that during his recent 
visit to the region Christopher had communicated to Israel the 
Syrian concept of the peace process, after which he directly 
left Israel for Washington. This shows he sensed a negative 
response from Israel on the Syrian peace concepts, which are 
within the framework of the realization of international 
legitimacy and the UN resolutions.

<F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Ahmed Benbitour by Gerard </F>
Nicaud; place and date not given: "Quickly Mobilize Our 
Credits"] 
  [Text] [Nicaud] You signed an agreement with the Paris Club 
on Thursday [2 June] evening. Are you satisfied? 
  [Benbitour] The rescheduling is based on an economic program 
that was examined with the IMF. The agreement we signed with 
the Paris Club reduces the foreign debt by $5 billion (out of a 
total of $26 billion -- LE FIG-ECO editorial note). As we hope 
that these credits will be made available quickly, the 
rescheduling should make it possible for us to finance the 
program. 
  [Nicaud] When taking the IMF, the World Bank, and the 
European Union into account, how much money do you hope will be 
made available? 
  [Benbitour] A total of $1 billion from the IMF, another $1 
billion from the other institutions, and $5 billion from the 
rescheduling. This does not include bilateral assistance in the 
form of commodity credits. 
  [Nicaud] Did France make a special effort? 
  [Benbitour] France stated that it would maintain the level 
of 
the financing facilities that it has previously made available 
to us (5-6 billion French francs -- LE FIG-ECO editorial note). 
However, the most important thing is the quick availability of 
the credits. Indeed, when launching a recovery program, 
negative effects such as the rise in the price of products 
following a devaluation (dinar was devalued by almost 50 
percent) come immediately, whereas positive effects come later. 
This difficult period for the people must be limited. It is a 
question of credibility. 
  [Nicaud] Does this rescheduling not come too late? 
  [Benbitour] It comes at the right time. Over the last six 
years, foreign debt has represented 75 percent of export 
earnings. In 1993, it rose to 86 percent and it could have 
exceeded 90 percent this year if there had been no rescheduling. 
  As you know, Algeria lives mainly on its exports of 
hydrocarbons. In 1991, Algerian oil was worth $21 a barrel. 
This year, we have planned the budget on a $15 basis. Each 
dollar less per barrel represents a $500 loss in income for the 
whole year. In six years, Algeria had to cut its imports by 
half. Because of a lack of supplies, namely, spare parts, the 
industrial sector is operating only at 50 percent of capacity. 
  [Nicaud] The Paris Club agreement complements a readjustment 
program jointly developed with the IMF. What are the next steps? 
  [Benbitour] We will concentrate our efforts on reducing the 
budget deficit from 9.2 percent of GDP last year to 3.2 percent 
in 1994. This objective is possible due to the devaluation of 
the dinar. 
  [Nicaud] With 2 million people out of work, unemployment 
remains the number one problem in Algeria. What impact do you 
expect your program to have on employment? 
  [Benbitour] Nearly 250,000 people enter the labor market 
each 
year. Up till now, the government has granted money to anyone 
whose income does not exceed a certain amount. We would now 
like to give compensation to those who engage in public utility 
activities. This requires a complete remodeling of the system. 
Besides the gas industry, we are targeting growth in those 
sectors employing a large number of workers.

  [Excerpt] The effective beginning of the period following 
the accord on rescheduling the public debt seems to be 
characterized by the government's control of available data and 
by drawing the main lines of the strategy in order to avoid as 
much as possible any negative repercussions -- all while 
eliminating any possible difficulty in the postagreement period. 
  All this transpires before highlighting the positive effect 
of the agreement, which often emerges in the long run. The 
statement by Finance Minister Ahmed Benbitour falls within this 
context. Benbitou stressed that the most important thing was the 
speed with which the loans obtained up to date from the IMF, in 
accordance with the agreement, will be used. Bachir Hedibel 
reports: 
  [Hedibel] During the period following the Paris Club 
agreement, which is the same period preceded by the transitional 
agreement with the IMF, the government will work to focus its 
efforts on reducing the budget deficit, so the latter will reach 
3.2 percent next year. This is the content of the statement 
made by the finance minister. 
  Benbitour hopes today for a speedy use of the loans granted 
to Algeria by the IMF or other financial institutions, or in 
accordance with the agreement with Paris Club. [passage omitted]

  [Text] [Announcer] Following the agreement with the Paris 
Club on the rescheduling of Algeria's official debts, conditions 
of the agreement and modalities of the repayment of the debts 
were the main topics of the news conference held yesterday by 
Minister of Finance Ahmed Benbitour. More details with 
Abdelkader Djeridi. 
  [Djeridi] Minister of Finance Ahmed Benbitour stated at 
yesterday's news conference that the agreement on rescheduling 
Algeria's official debts, signed on 31 May 1994, stipulated a 
gradual repayment as from the fifth year [1999]. 
  The minister of finance pointed out that such a method, 
known 
as a shared repayment, was different from the method drawn up by 
the Houston Club for debtor countries with a low income. 
  As concerns Algeria, whose $5 billion in debts were 
rescheduled over 16 years with a four-year grace period, it 
would be paying from the fifth year 1.39 percent of the original 
loans. It would be paying 2.17 percent in the sixth year, 3.06 
percent in the seventh year, 4.08 percent in the eighth year and 
so forth. Accordingly, in eight years Algeria would have paid 
10.7 percent of the original loan and in 10 years 22.5 percent, 
he added. 
  Houston conditions would, according to the minister, have 
cost the country 28.6 percent more in 10 years. 
  The minister of finance also pointed out that the agreement 
with the Paris Club would allow Algeria to go back to the 
financial markets. He affirmed that the agreement, which was 
supported by a letter of intent, would open the way for another 
meeting with the Paris Club next year. 
  As far as commercial debts were concerned, Mr Ahmed 
Benbitour 
pointed out that talks on the technicalities were under way 
between Algerian banks and foreign banks in order find out 
whether such debts could be refinanced or rescheduled with the 
London Club. In either case, however, commercial debts would not 
exceed the amount of the official debts that were recheduled 
recently. 
  As far as banking system was concerned, the minister said he 
would support any initiative to set up private banks for the 
sake of creating competition within the Algerian banking system. 
  [Announcer] On the other hand, the minister of finance has 
given more details on the agreement with the Paris Club, and 
asserted that Algeria had big development potential, had made a 
great leap forward in the economic reforms, and had the ability 
to find solutions. 
  [Djeridi] Mr Benbitour has affirmed that Algeria has, in 
addition, human, hydrocarbon, agricultural, and huge 
infrastructural potentials which could be developed further. 
When these winning cards are well utilized, Algeria can 
overcome its crisis, he added. However, population growth, 
which is serious, would create huge social demands and require a 
production mechanism which would reach 50 percent of its 
potential. 
  In this context, Ahmed Benbitour pointed out that Algeria 
could achieve growth of 3 percent this year and 6 percent in 
1995, without having to look for further investment. The 
potential of the existing installations was sufficient to meet 
such a target as long as there was a good supply of semifinished 
raw materials. 
  In a second stage, production could be increased to more 
than 
70 percent through industrial restructuring, more investment, 
and fruitful partnership. 
  At his news conference, Minister of Finance Ahmed Benbitour 
dwelt on the economic program. It is based on economic growth 
through developing the gas sector as well as small and medium 
companies, creating jobs and economic stability, and controlling 
the money supply and inflation.

  [Text] Following the satisfaction recorded by the European 
troika, the European Union is to order the release of a $150

Algeria and four other countries will also benefit from loans 
from the Islamic Development Bank [IDB]. The IDB is to grant 
Algeria a $6.5 million loan to be spent on papier mache exports.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 9 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Algeria has 
requested Malaysia's help to present its proposal for the 
establishment of ties between the Maghreb Union and ASEAN. 
  Algeria, this year's chairman of the Maghreb Union, made the 
request at a meeting between its foreign minister, Mohamed Salah 
Dembri and his Malaysian counterpart Abdullah Ahmad Badawi 
during the latter's four-day visit from June 5 to the country. 
  Senior officials of both countries were also present during 
the meeting. 
  A statement issued by the Malaysian Foreign Ministry 
Thursday 
[9 June], said Abdullah had promised to present Algeria's 
proposal at the annual meeting of ASEAN's foreign ministers in 
Bangkok next month. 
  He believed that there would be no objection to the proposal 
since ASEAN had established ties with several regional groupings 
such as the Gulf Cooperation Council, Rio Group and European 
Union. 
  Hopefully a meeting between ASEAN and the Maghreb Union 
could 
be held during this year's session of the United Nations (UN) 
General Assembly, the statement said. 
  During the visit, Abdullah also called on Algerian President 
General Lamine Zeroual, and held discussions with Prime Minister 
Mokdad Sifi. 
  During the bilateral discussions, both foreign ministers 
also 
felt that closer ties between Algeria and Malaysia could further 
strengthen the South-South cooperation particularly within the 
framework of Group-15. 
  Both countries also agreed on exchange of experience in 
economic development, training, technical cooperation, trade, 
investment, education and culture. 
  Being Islamic countries emphasising on development for the 
people, Malaysia and Algeria agree on exchange of ideas between 
their Islamic intellectuals on Islam and development, the 
statement said. 
  On enhancing economic cooperation, Malaysia and Algeria had 
agreed to look into and sign several agreements including those 
on economic, scientific and technical cooperation, investment 
protection and assurance, and waving of visa's requirement.

  [Text] Cairo, 9 Jun (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has 
urged U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to support the 
nonaligned foreign ministers's call for convening an 
international conference on Bosnia to be sponsored by the United 
Nations. 
  This came in a message from 'Amr Musa to Christopher on this 
resolution. 
  Musa clarified that the objectives of this conference are to 
immediately apply the cease-fire and to put an end to all 
military activities under the supervision of the peace-keeping 
forces. In addition, the other objectives are to turn 
Bosnia-Herzegovina into a safe-haven and guarantee that the 
regional borders and sovereignty are not harmed. 
  MENA has learned that Musa sent a similar message to French 
Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and Douglas Hurd, British secretary 
of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs, about the 
extensive efforts Egyptian diplomacy is exerting to support the 
Bosnian cause.

Department's statement indicates that the United States is 
trying to involve itself in the situation in Yemen and dictate 
certain policies on that country. Instead of getting alarmed 
over Yemen, the United States would do well to stop interfering 
in its affairs and hatching plots against its unity.

  [Text] Rabat, June 08 (MAP) -- King Hassan II Tuesday 
presided at a ministers' council after the Prime Minister and 
Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation Abdellatif Filali 
presented him the members of the new cabinet. 
  During the council, the sovereign, who underlined Filali's 
qualities and renewed his trust to the cabinet members, pointed 
out that the responsibility of each minister is full and not 
dependent on conjuncture and that all the cabinet members should 
shoulder this responsibility without any reservation to lead the 
country towards the sought social peace and prosperity. 
  King Hassan II stressed the virtues of dialog that all the 
ministers, together or separately, should kindle with all the 
partners and all the institutions. The sovereign laid a special 
emphasis on the good relations that the government should have 
with the parliament and with the political groups and trade 
unions represented in the legislative assembly. 
  King Hassan II also underlined the necessity to carry on 
work 
on the major dossiers especially those of privatization and 
attraction of new investments and urged the cabinet to grant 
permanent attention to the issues of employment and education. 
He said the creation of jobs should be at the forefront of the 
cabinet concerns. As to the educational issue, he said he is to 
address shortly a message on the matter to the parliament as 
announced in the throne day speech last March 3rd. 
  Filali then took the floor to express thanks to King Hassan 
II for the trust he showed him by appointing him prime minister 
and renewed his attachment to the royal instructions and 
commitment to abide by these instructions in his policy. Filali 
underlined his unshakable confidence in the sovereign's 
perspicacity and wisdom and in the virtues of dialog.

  [Text] An Israeli delegation headed by 'Oded 'Eran, 
Foreign Ministry deputy director general, is currently in 
Morocco discussing ways to improve economic relations between 
the two countries. 
  Jerusalem believes that despite the fact that King Hassan is 
still hesitant to establish diplomatic relations with Israel, in 
his meeting with Foreign Minister Peres last week he agreed to 
take energetic steps to improve economic relations between the 
two countries. 
  The Foreign Ministry delegation left for Morocco to prepare 
for Israel's participation in the talks of the working group on 
Middle East economic development in the framework of the 
bilateral talks. The deliberations of this committee will open 
in the Moroccan capital of Rabat next Thursday and will last 
three days. This will be the fifth round of talks for this 
committee, and it will be attended by 30 delegations, 14 of 
which will come from Arab countries. 
  The talks will mainly focus on the development of regional 
transportation in the Middle East, and cooperation between the 
countries on issues of tourism and agriculture. An effort will 
be made for the first time to informally discuss the 
institutionalization of cooperation. 
  The Israeli delegation will be headed by Prof. Ya'aqov 
Frenkel, Bank of Israel governor, and Uri Savir, Foreign 
Ministry deputy director general. It will also include 
representatives of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], the Foreign 
and Finance Ministries, and the Bank of Israel. The delegation 
will also be accompanied by a group of Israeli reporters.

that additional efforts must be made to boost this relationship. 
He made reference to exchanges in the field of agricultural 
products between the EU and Morocco. 
  Mr. Hans van den Broek, praised the leading role played by 
Morocco as an element of stability in the Maghreban, Arab, and 
international arenas, both at the political and economic level. 
  At a news conference, which he held this afternoon in Rabat, 
he said that he was happy to have been received by His Majesty 
King Hassan II and described the talks he held with Moroccan 
officials as serious and fruitful. He emphasized the utmost 
importance that the EU accords to establishing a genuine 
partnership with Morocco proceeding from its conviction that 
European stability is linked to the stability of the Arab 
Maghreb region. 
  He said that coincident with his visit to Morocco, the time 
had come for the European bloc to adopt a realistic policy that 
fulfils the aspirations of the Moroccan and European sides, with 
the intention of opening up broad horizons for bolstering 
economic cooperation at all levels. 
  Mr. van den Broek announced in this regard that at the end 
of 
the current month, the European parliament would undertake a 
study of the situation in the Arab Maghreb region. [passage

  [Excerpts] Rabat, 8 Jun -- The military court in Rabat, 
which since last Monday has been hearing the case of eight 
people (six Moroccans and two Algerians) accused of "breaking 
the laws related to arms, ammunition and collaboration," will 
begin to debate the core of this case after [word indistinct] on 
Wednesday beginning at 1600. [passage omitted] 
  This case is related in particular to the possession of

  [Text] Tunis, 9 Jun (MENA)--Sudanese Foreign Minister 
Husayn Abu-Salih has affirmed the depth of Egyptian-Sudanese 
relations and the importance of maintaining these relations at 
the proper level to benefit the Egyptian and Sudanese peoples. 
  In an exclusive interview with MENA in Tunis, where he is 
attending the meetings of the OAU Ministerial Council, Abu-Salih 
said that at times this relationship becomes strained or tense. 
This is the case now, when it has reached a "saddening" level, 
but we must do everything possible to maintain this relationship 
at an appropriate level. 
  The Sudanese minister stressed that the issues under dispute 
between the two countries, including Hala'ib, are quite simple; 
finding a solution to this issue will be much simpler than 
anyone expects. 
  Abu-Salih criticized the media in the two countries, saying 
that the media should be positive instead of indulging in 
vituperations that do not serve the two countries' interest. 
  He said that the current tension between Egypt and Sudan was 
caused by the two countries' foreign ministers failure to hold a 
meeting as scheduled. He underlined the need to hold this 
meeting in Khartoum "to demonstrate the Sudanese Government's 
stand to the Sudanese public." 
  He expressed full confidence that he and Egyptian Foreign 
Minister 'Amr Musa will work together to resolve all the 
disputes between the two countries. He stressed the need for 
confidence between the two countries and for this not to be 
hampered by "some simple events, such as when Khartoum Province 
took over some houses that belong to Egyptians there." He said 
that the image of the Sudanese Government must be changed. 
  Speaking about the Hala'ib problem, Abu-Salih said: We do 
not want to complicate this problem, because the relationship 
between Egypt and Sudan is too great to allow this issue to move 
from a "bilateral framework into international forums."

  [Excerpt] Tunis, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Sudanese Foreign 
Minister Dr. Husayn Abu-Salih has stressed that no transient 
problems or differences can harm crucial relations between Sudan 
and Egypt. 
  Abu-Salih, who is heading his country's delegation to the 
OAU 
Foreign Ministers Council meetings in Tunis, told AL-SHARQ 
AL-AWSAT that, "no matter how we describe the phase 
Sudanese-Egyptian relations are experiencing, we in Sudan 
believe that we must overcome minor things and move toward the 
major and sublime aim of restoring relations between the two 
countries to their normal course in the interests of the two 
peoples who have existed in the Nile Valley for thousands of 
years." 
  Dr. Abu-Salih attributed the strain in relations between 
Sudan and Egypt to "the lack of mutual trust between the 
Sudanese and Egyptian sides. Thus we must work sincerely to 
restore trust between the two sides." 
  The Sudanese foreign minister stressed that "a serious 
bilateral dialogue is the only way to build strong and sound 
relations between Egypt and Sudan." 
  He said optimistically and confidently that, "whatever the 
problems, we are confident that we will work to restore our 
relations to their normal status in which the Sudanese and 
Egyptian people see their common destiny." 
  Asked about his country's support for extremist movements, 
the main cause of the strain in relations between Sudan and the 
countries suffering as a result of this phenomenon, Abu-Salih 
said, "We are against religious, and even nonreligious, 
extremism. We advocate moderation and believe that many of the 
accusations leveled at Sudan in this connection are absolutely 
baseless." 
  He added that his country "is seeking to lay the foundations 
for serious action among all the Arab states in order to move 
toward solidarity and to secure all the factors that serve the 
security and stability of all the peoples of the Arab and 
African regions." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Mobile forces have safely finished opening the land 
route linking Renk with Malakal, which had been closed for more 
than 10 years. In a press statement, a coordinator with the 
people's defense in the Upper Nile State, 'Abd-al-Halim Adam, 
stressed that the scattered remnants of the rebellion's army in 
the region have suffered a collapse of morale, and a great 
number of them have expressed their wish to surrender. 
  He said that government soldiers, the people's defense, 
people's police, and the national service, with the support of 
the citizens, participated in the opening up of the road. 
  Meanwhile, the command of the people's defense has called on 
all combatants to enlist in the Misk al-Khitam Brigade, which is 
currently heading toward the operational zone. The deadline for 
enlisting is 13 June, at Mawlid Square in Khartoum. 
  This comes as a support for national unity, development 
plans, and the defense of peace in the country.

  [Excerpt] Observers have not been able to find a reason for 
the escalation of the Sudanese measures against Egypt at this 
particular time. According to exclusive information available 
to AL-'ARABI, the reason is this: The Sudanese opposition radio 
station has begun its transmission and is now heard in Khartoum. 
The Sudanese Government holds Cairo responsible. 
  However, according to information, the opposition radio is 
being hired from an overseas country for $500 per hour, is 
transmitting to Sudan through satellite, and Cairo has 
absolutely nothing to do with it. In fact, Egypt had rejected 
numerous requests from the Sudanese opposition to allow the 
radio to transmit from Cairo, and this has worsened the 
relations between the two sides for several months. 
  The radio was launched by the personal efforts of some 
academic and military elements independent of the Sudanese 
opposition group. Those elements tried to activate the 
opposition in light of the poor performance of the National 
Sudanese Grouping as a result of disagreements between the Ummah 
Party and the Sudanese Communist Party over the grouping's 
internal structure. The disagreements also led to differences 
between the two main parties, the Ummah Party and the Democratic 
Unionist Party [DUP], and this necessitated the presence of DUP 
Chairman Muhammad 'Uthman al-Mirghani in Cairo to try to contain 
the crisis. 
  The danger of the opposition radio, which began two hours of 
transmission daily, is that it ends the isolation of the 
Sudanese citizen and obstructs the regime's media hegemony. 
This is a threat to the regime itself, especially given the 
worsening domestic problems. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by 'Adnan Husayn: "Iraqi Opposition Stresses </F>
Situation in Kurdistan Under Control"] 
  [Excerpts] London -- An Iraqi opposition official has 
stressed that the situation in Iraqi Kurdistan is now under 
control after a month of armed conflict over power between the 
Kurdistan Democratic Party [KDP], led by Mas'ud Barzani, and the 
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK], led by Jalal Talabani. The 
conflict resulted in the deaths of at least 600 ordinary 
citizens from the two sides. 
  Dr. Ahmad al-Jalabi, head of the [Unified] Iraqi National 
Congress Executive Bureau, told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT over the 
telephone yesterday from his residence in the city of Salah 
al-Din in north Iraq that "life has returned to normal" in most 
Kurdish areas since the meeting held last Sunday between Barzani 
and Talabani. [passage omitted] 
  Asked about the clashes that broke out the day before 
yesterday in the Qal'at Dizah and Halabjah areas near the border 
with Iran, al-Jalabi said that the National Congress, which has 
been entrusted with the task of disengaging the warring 
militias, sent forces belonging to it to these areas yesterday 
"to disengage the forces and prevent fighting from breaking out 
between them." 
  PUK (Talabani) sources accused joint forces of the KDP 
(Barzani) and Kurdish Islamic organizations, which are accused 
of collaborating with Iran and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, 
of attacking PUK positions in these areas. But sources from 
Barzani's party have denied that the KDP forces participated in 
these clashes, which they said took place between "PUK forces 
and Islamic Movement forces only." 
  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that a tripartite meeting 
bringing together leaders from Barzani's party, Talabani's 
party, and the Islamic Movement was held yesterday in Irbil to 
discuss ways of stopping the clashes in the border areas.

  [Text] Baghdad, June 5, INA--Arab and International 
Relations Committee of the National Assembly is currently 
working out a plan for the coming period on the political moves 
to illustrate Iraq's viewpoint vis-a-vis UN Security Council 
resolutions and expose attempts by some parties to prolong the 
imposition of the anti-Iraq sanctions for realizing political 
purposes unrelated to the original texts of the UN resolutions. 
  Vice-chairman of the committee Taha Ahmad al-Dawud was 
quoted 
by a local daily as saying that the plan aims at urging the 
world politicians and parliamentarians, and those of Britain and 
the U.S. in particular to work for lifting the anti-Iraq 
sanctions and holding the U.S. and Britain responsible for the 
death of tens of thousands of Iraqis and the destruction of 
Iraq's infrastructure. 
  The plan, moreover, will make it clear that the continuation 
of the economic blockade runs counter to human rights and 
Washington's and London's claims and boasts of being the ardent 
advocates of human rights, said Mr. al-Dawud. 
  He went on to say that invitation will be sent to a number 
of 
world MPs to visit Iraq for dialoge and to get acquainted with 
the negative consequences of the U.S.-allied aggression and the 
continuation of the UN-imposed economic sanctions. 
  The committee's plan also aims at urging the world MPs to 
exercise pressure on their governments towards lifting the 
embargo. 
  Moreover, the National Assembly, through its Arab and 
International Relations Committee will work for holding talks 
with MPs of the Security Council member-states in addition to 
exchanging letters with heads of the world parliaments on their 
stands and Iraq's stand vis-a-vis UN Security Council 
resolutions and allegations and claims aired by iraq's enemies 
to divert the world's attention from the recent positive 
development in the stands of a number of the UN Security Council 
member-states and in a bid to manipulate the world public 
opinion, Mr. al-Dawud concluded.

  [Text] Baghdad, 6 Jun (INA)--The Iraqi National Assembly 
has appealed to the world parliaments and the international and 
Arab organizations concerned with the health, environment, and 
development affairs, as well as to popular gatherings, world 
environmental parties, and the forces which love good and peace 
to pressure their governments into playing an effective role to 
lift the blockade imposed on Iraq. 
  In a statement issued today on the world environment day, 
the 
assembly pointed out that the Iraqi people are denied the 
simplest requirements of life; namely, food and medicines, with 
the full knowledge of the UN organizations. It also pointed to 
the practices pursued by such UN institutions on the pretext of 
protecting human rights. 
  The statement added that safeguarding the world environment 
should emanate from curbing the U.S. policy which is hostile to 
the world states and people. In this regard, the statement 
pointed to the aggressive war against Iraq which destroyed 
drinking water purification stations, sewage disposal stations, 
fuel tanks, and oil wells. This resulted in the worst 
environmental disaster in the world. 
  The statement stressed the need for consolidating and 
continuing the efforts to safeguard both the environment and 
public health as a prelude to lifting the unfair economic 
blockade on the Iraqi people because it would be another 
environmental and health gain on the international level.

  [Text] London, AL-HAYAH -- The Kurdistan Democratic Party 
[KDP], led by Mas'ud Barzani, has stressed that the "initiative" 
taken by the Kurdish leader Barzani for the declaration of Iraqi 
Kurdistan as a "UN protectorate" is "of a temporary nature 
linked to the downfall of the Iraqi regime, and would not affect 
the issues of democracy for Iraq and federation for Kurdistan." 
  A KDP spokesman in London has told AL-HAYAH that the 
initiative "is based on Chapter 12 of the UN Charter, defining 
UN protection and trusteeship." He emphasized that the Iraqi 
Kurdish region "requires a definition of status under 
international law on which dealings with the Kurdish 
administration would be based." 
  Barzani had linked his proposal to the "failure" of the 
Kurdish administration experiment, especially the powersharing 
between his party and Jalal Talabani's party (Patriotic Union of 
Kurdistan [PUK]). He particularly underscored the 
demilitarization of Iraqi Kurdistan. 
  The spokesman pointed out that the proposal-initiative has 
"political, economic, and humanitarian dimensions and, at any 
rate, it is up for discussion locally (in the Kurdish areas), at 
Iraqi resistance level, and at the international level. There 
is an urgent need for a stable political situation in northern 
Iraq." 
  He said that "one point in the initiative's favor is the 
regime's violation of international law and the fact that it has 
completely blockaded Kurdistan, thereby isolating it from the 
rest of Iraq." He drew attention to the importance of "securing 
a more stable economic situation in that the international 
community should take more serious measures to tackle the two 
blockades: the local and the international." He affirmed that 
"there should be a more stable political situation after 
demilitarization." 
  It is worth noting that Barzani's proposal calling for the 
demilitarization of northern Iraq and for making it a UN 
protectorate came after a month of fighting between his party's 
forces and the forces of Talabani's party. 
  The KDP spokesman confirmed that future meetings between the 
two leaders "would be devoted to the discussion of ways of 
ending the crisis and finding alternatives to this experiment." 
He emphasized that the KDP did not take part in the fighting 
which broke out the day before yesterday in the area of Qal'at 
Dizah near the Iranian border. He said the fighting was between 
Talabani's forces and forces of the Islamic Movement. 
  PUK sources have denied yesterday's IRANIAN NEWS AGENCY 
report that the KDP and the Islamic Movement's forces seized 
control of Banjwin and Qal'at Dizah. The sources did not say 
how many casualties fell in the fighting of two days ago. The 
agency had quoted an Islamic Movement official as saying that 
the PUK suffered a large number of casualties. It also expected

<F P=106> [Statement by unidentified spokesman on 8 June; place not </F>
given] 
  [Text] In response to a query on the focus of the prime 
minister's visit to the Russian Federation and India-Russian 
ties, the spokesman stated that the focus of the visit would be 
on lifting of the existing level of relationship to 
qualitatively higher levels and to new stages. The talks in 
Moscow would concentrate on the future in terms of bilateral 
cooperation regarding our attitudes towards international issues 
and what the two countries can do together in Asia and in the 
world. At the summit level the leaders will naturally not 
discuss minor matters of detail. 
  Elaborating further, he said that it was very clear even 
before the actual break up of the erstwhile Soviet Union that 
our relationship with Russia would be qualitatively different. 
One of the major tasks of our diplomatic efforts accordingly 
was to establish friendly and cooperative relations with the 
Russian Government. Since the emergence of the Russian 
Federation and our recognition that it was a successor state of 
the erstwhile USSR, bilateral ties were undergoing a process of 
consolidation and adjustment to the new realities. In this 
phase, right upto the visit of President Boris Yeltsin to New 
Delhi, various political and economic issues and parameters of 
trade and commerce were defined. The next logical phase is to 
raise the relationship to a qualitatively new level.

  [Text] In the Kashmir Valley, efforts are on to secure 
safe release of militants near Pahalgam two days ago. Three 
other members of the trekking team have returned to Srinagar. A 
number of organizations have appealed to the militants to 
release the innocent trekkers. 
  Two Pakistan-trained militants were killed in Kupwara 
District in an encounter with the security force. Four 
militants were arrested and a large quantity of arms and 
ammunition was recovered. 
  [Hong Kong AFP in English at 1307 GMT on 9 Jun 94 in a 
similar report adds the following: "Kashmiri separatist groups 
Thursday demanded the immediate release of two British hikers 
kidnapped by Moslem militants while trekking in the Himalayas. 
  ["The Indian authorities, meanwhile, rejected the demand by 
the Moslem rebels who snatched the two British nationals that 
three of their imprisoned leaders be freed in exchange for the 
hostages. 
  ["David Mackie, 36, a video producer from London, and Kim 
Housego, 16, the son of the former Financial Times correspondent 
in New Delhi, were abducted in the Himalayan foothills southeast 
of here by three heavily-armed men claiming to be members of the 
militant outfit Harkat-ul-Ansar or Movement of Friends. 
  ["In a note left for Kim Housego's father, David, the 
kidnappers demanded the release of three of the group's leaders 
from Indian jails and warned foreign tourists to stay out of 
Kashmir. 
  ["`Their release is not possible,' a government official 
told 
AFP. 
  ["The latest kidnapping was forcefully condemned by the two 
most powerful Kashmiri Moslem militant groups, the Jammu and 
Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) which seeks independence for 
Kashmir and the pro-Pakistan Hizbul Mujahideen. 
  ["`Such moves help India at the international level,' the 
JKLF said in an unconditional appeal for the release of the 
Britons. 
  ["The Hizbul Mujahideen, or Party of Moslem Warriors, called 
on the kidnappers to immediately release the Britons in the 
interests of the Kashmiri separatist movement. 
  ["`We have offered our help to identify these people,' said 
Majid Jehangir, the second-ranking leader of the Hizbul 
Mujahideen, which helped rescue a Portuguese engineer who was 
kidnapped by a group opposed to a power project in the state two 
years ago. 
  ["Both the JKLF and the Hizbul Mujahideen raised the 
possibility that the kidnapping may be the handiwork of Indian 
agents seeking to discredit the secessionist movement. 
  ["In a statement released here Wednesday, the 
Harkat-ul-Ansar 
claimed responsibility for the kidnapping and said it was done 
to attract world attention to human rights abuses by Indian 
troops battling the insurgency. 
  ["The Jamiat-ul-Islami, the Hizb's political wing, denounced 
the abduction by the group and appealed for the release of the 
two `guests' without `delay or harm.' 
  ["`It is unwise to commit such a human rights violation and 
then suggest that it would help focus world attention on gross 
rights abuses by Indian security forces,' said Jamiat leader 
Ghulam Mohammed Bhat."]

  [Text] Honored listeners, an official spokesman at the 
Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY] Defense Ministry has issued 
the following statement to the YEMENI NEWS AGENCY, Aden: At a 
time when the sons of our Yemeni people, brothers, and friends 
were looking forward to the declaration of the cease-fire, with 
effect from 1800 this evening, 9 June, in implementation of UN 
security resolution No. 924, and in response to the sincere 
efforts of Mr. al-Akhdar al-Ibrahimi, the UN secretary general's 
envoy to Yemen, our forces deployed on the Abyan and Lahij axes 
were subjected to a comprehensive surprise attack and 
concentrated artillery barrage, which was launched by the forces 
of the ruling military regime in Sanaa. This attack is still in 
progress. The Armed Forces of the DRY, which are absolutely and 
totally observing the cease-fire resolution in effect from 1800 
this evening, so as to prevent the shedding of Yemeni blood in 
respect and appreciation for the good and sincere efforts of the 
UN envoy, affirm to the masses of our people in the DRY their 
complete ability to repel the cowardly aggressors, and to force 
them into respecting the international authority and its 
resolutions. The Defense Ministry wishes at the same time to 
praise the good efforts resulting from the high degree of 
responsibility on the part of the UN envoy, and to appeal to the 
UN Security Council to take stern measures against this raging 
aggressor, who not only sheds the blood of our Yemeni people, 
but defies the will of the whole international community.

  [Excerpt] Aden, Yemen, June 10 (AFP) -- Northern heavy

Ambulances rushed to the scene, but there was no immediate 
casualty toll available. 
  The bombardment cut off electricity supplies to several

  [Excerpts] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council, along with Shaykh 
'Abd-al- Majid al-Zandani, member of the Presidential Council, 
met yesterday evening with several representative dignitaries, 
notables, and social figures from the Yafi' District in the 
Lahij Governorate. [passage omitted] 
  The brother chairman of the Presidential Council spoke at 
the 
meeting, expressing his thanks and gratitude for the high 
national unionist spirit demonstrated by the sons of Yafi' 
District, the heroic strugglers who have shown true belonging to 
the homeland and faith in unity. He noted that the secessionist 
rebels, led by the traitor and agent al-Bid, have imposed 
challenges on unity by their plots and pursuit of their 
destructive selfish interests. 
  He said the broad national support for the Armed Forces, 
which are defending unity and legitimacy, demonstrated by the 
sons of the Yemeni people all over the Yemeni homeland, is a 
sincere expression of the meaning of unity for our people. 
Unity means pride, dignity, existence, and the fate for all 
Yemenis. It is not possible to imagine the present and future 
of Yemen without unity. The masses of our people have zealously 
and eagerly stood up for unity to bolster it, baptizing it with 
the pure blood and the precious sacrifices of the sons of our 
people and their Armed Forces in order to preserve and maintain 
unity. 
  He added that unity deserves all sacrifices. Our people are 
willing to make more sacrifices and they will defend their 
unity, even if they have to use stones if weapons are not 
available. They will uphold the slogan of unity or death. 
  The brother president praised the stands of the sons of the 
Yafi' District, who have valiantly confronted the gang of 
secession and rebellion and defeated it in more than one 
location. The sons of Yafi' have proven to be strong strugglers 
who are loyal to principles and to the homeland's causes and 
unity. 
  He said our people are today formulating a new history in 
their life and effort to make a prosperous, stable future which 
cannot be imagined without unity. He pointed out that our 
struggling Yemeni people, who have been hardened by experience, 
have championed their will all along and are today capable of 
defeating this new challenge imposed by the criminal 
secessionist gang on unity. The Yemeni people will emerge 
victorious, God willing, because the will of the people derives 
from the will of God. He said all efforts will be mobilized in 
the next stage to repair and reconstruct what has been destroyed 
by the war imposed by the secessionists on the homeland and to 
build a new Yemen based on unity, democracy, comprehensive 
development, broad popular participation, building modern 
institutions, establishing law and order, respecting human 
rights and social justice. 
  The meeting was attended by brother Yahya al-Ra'i, member of 
the House of Representatives.

  [Excerpts] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
Presidential Council chairman, today received brother Lakhdar 
Brahimi, personal envoy of UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali. During the meeting, the two sides discussed 
issues related to Lakhdar Brahimi's fact-finding mission in our 
country. [passage omitted] 
  Following the meeting, Presidential Council Chairman Lt. 
Gen. 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih said that his meeting with brother Lakhdar 
Brahimi was useful regarding the mission he is entrusted with as 
an envoy of the UN secretary general. He noted that the 
Republic of Yemen has previously announced its compliance with 
UN Security Council Resolution No. 924, and its readiness to 
deal with all its clauses. He added that it is fully ready to 
implement this resolution. He said: A cease-fire was 
immediately announced for the past two days. Very regrettably, 
the rebels and violators of the constitutional legitimacy are 
the ones who reject this resolution. 
  The Presidential Council chairman reiterated the Republic of 
Yemen's compliance with the UN Security Council resolution, 
saying: We will cooperate to implement it in letter and spirit 
in order to avoid any repercussions that might occur in Yemen 
and the region. 
  Answering a question by television Channel One on the 
results 
of his meeting with the Presidential Council chairman, brother 
Lakhdar Brahimi said: I very thankful to and appreciate his 
excellency the president, who gave me this time despite the fact 
that he is very busy and has huge responsibilities. I can say 
that our talks were very good. We spoke about the current 
situation in this country, which is dear to all of us. The 
brother president has reassured us that the decisions that will 
be made in the future will please all the Yemenis and the 
international community. 
  Answering another question on the Yemeni Government's 
understanding of UN Security Council Resolution No. 924 on the 
situation in the Republic of Yemen, Lakhdar Brahimi said: The 
Yemeni Government has expressed its stand toward this 
resolution, and explained this stand. What concerns me in this 
resolution is the mission I am carrying out. 
  He added: I reiterate that I am proud because the brothers 
in the Republic of Yemen have accepted me to carry out this 
mission. In fact, the talks that were held with the brother 
president today prove that there is confidence and full 
readiness to carry out this mission. As for the Republic of 
Yemen's stand toward this resolution, it was expressed through 
official stands inside and outside this country, and the United 
Nations was informed of this. 
  Replying to a question on the measures he is planning to 
take, brother Lakhdar Brahimi said: We are continuing our 
contacts with the brothers in the Republic of Yemen. These 
meetings will continue to complete the information so that we 
can present the report that is required from us.

  [Excerpts] Our special correspondent in Yemen, Ahmad Birru, 
has reported on the atmosphere prevailing in Sanaa in the wake 
of UN Envoy Lakhdar Brahimi's talks and the cease-fire decision. 
[passage omitted] 
  Ahmad Birru met with Brahimi and asked him about the results 
of his contacts with the Sanaa officials yesterday and today and 
the talks he will be holding with the southern officials. He 
also asked him to give an evaluation of the seriousness of the 
new cease-fire decision. Brahimi said: 
  [Begin Brahimi recording] I had the honor to hold a long 
meeting with his excellency the president of the republic at 
noon today. I will be meeting a number of party leaders. 
Tomorrow I will meet with members of parliament. I will then 
leave Sanaa to continue my contacts elsewhere. 
  Perhaps at 1500 [1200 GMT] you heard a news item from Sanaa 
radio to the effect that the Government of the Republic of Yemen 
has decided to implement a cease-fire as of 1800 [1500 GMT] 
today. We greatly hope that this time the cease-fire will hold. 
Moreover, the brothers in the Yemeni Republic affirm that they 
are prepared to enter into a dialogue with the other side but on 
principles which they believe are essentials for such a 
dialogue. I believe that this is an encouraging beginning. We 
hope that little by little, this country will be extricated from 
its current affliction. [end recording] 
  Our correspondent was careful to explore all aspects of 
Brahimi's mission in Sanaa and directed the following questions 
at him: 
  [Begin recording] [Birru] The Yemeni Government is prepared 
to hold a dialogue with the other side. Does this mean that the 
exception to the leaders of the secession has been waived? 
  [Brahimi] They say that they have certain principles. It is 
not for me to list these principles because if we forget one of 
them, we will have problems. You may ask the Yemeni brothers 
and they will tell you what they are. Whether or not these 
principles will be acceptable to the other side, we do not know. 
However, I consider it to be a good step when I am told that 
they are prepared for dialogue but with certain conditions. 
Well, I say you are welcome, let us see these conditions and 
consult with the other side. 
  [Birru] Will you meet with the leaders of the other side in 
Aden, al-Mukalla, or in an Arab country? 
  [Brahimi] The important thing is to meet with the brothers 
and talk to them. The venue is immaterial. This means we will 
make the necessary arrangements for this to take place. 
  [Birru] The answers you received in Sanaa were positive and 
encouraging? 
  [Brahimi] Undoubtedly. 
  [Birru] Will you return to Sanaa shortly? 
  [Brahimi] I think I will return to Sanaa but I do not know 
when. 
  [Birru] Thank you. [end recording] 
  Brahimi did not reveal the place for which he will be 
leaving 
tomorrow to meet with the southern leaders. However, sources 
close to him said that he will be leaving for the Jordanian 
capital, Amman, where he will meet with southern Yemeni leaders, 
among whom is believed to be 'Ali Salim al-Bid.

  [Text] Brother Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN secretary general's 
special envoy, yesterday met with leaders of political parties 
and organizations in the Republic of Yemen. 
  At the outset of the meeting, Brother Dr. Qasim Sallam, 
secretary of the Yemen Regional Command of the Arab Socialist 
Ba'th Party, acting on his own behalf and on behalf of Yemeni 
party leaders, welcomed Brother Lakhdar Brahimi as a 
representative of international legitimacy, which our country 
and government welcome. He said: Undoubtedly, events in our 
country are of interest to the entire world because the Yemeni 
people now find themselves in a difficult situation brought 
about by a small group that rebelled against constitutional 
legitimacy and the Yemeni people's will, as well as the will of 
history. 
  On his part, Brother Lakhdar Brahimi said he hopes the 
Republic of Yemen will be able to overcome the current state. 
He noted the importance of dialogue to establish peace. 
  The brother party leaders spoke during the meeting, 
stressing 
that Yemeni unity is the Yemeni people's fate and future. They 
will not relinquish it because it was a great achievement of our 
people on 22 May 1990, following a long struggle by the Yemeni 
people through the various stages of the Yemeni national 
movement. They kept that dream, which lived in the mind of the 
people for scores of years, until they achieved it by the 
establishment of the Yemeni Republic on 22 May 1990, the Yemeni 
people's plebiscite on the Constitution, and the general 
elections on 27 April 1993 within the context of political and 
party pluralism. 
  The party leaders noted that what is going on in Yemen is 
not 
a war between the north and south as portrayed by hostile media, 
but, rather, a war between the Yemeni people and the 
secessionist clique in the Socialist Party that rebelled against 
legitimacy and the constitutional institutions, fabricated the 
political crisis, and imposed a war on the people. 
  The brother party leaders then engaged in a lengthy 
discussion on the situations in our country and their dimensions.

  [Text] A meeting was held at the Ministry of Planning and 
Development today with a number of the ambassadors to our 
country from fraternal and friendly states, as well as officials 
from certain international organizations. 
  Mutahhar 'Abdallah al-Sa'idi, deputy minister of planning 
and 
development, spoke at the meeting about the emergency needs 
faced by the country in the fields of health, water, sewage, 
electricity, and education that have resulted from the military 
operations carried out by the secessionist clique in the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP] leadership. He said many of these 
facilities were damaged during these military operations. 
  He also spoke about the pressing need to extend urgent aid, 
food and shelters to the citizens who were harmed during that 
period. 
  'Awni al-'Ani, representative of the UN program in Sanaa, 
spoke during the meeting. He stressed the urgent need for this 
aid, hoping that these states will cooperate, either directly, 
or within the framework of the United Nations, to extend the 
necessary aid. He noted that committees to assess damages will 
begin their work as soon as possible to determine the actual 
needs. 
  The under secretary of the Public Health Ministry attended 
the meeting.

<F P=106> [Report on telephone interview with 'Abd-al-'Aziz </F>
'Abd-al-Ghani, member of the Yemeni Presidential Council and 
assistant secretary general of the General People's Congress, in 
Paris, by unidentified correspondent in London; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, member of the 
Yemeni Presidential Council and assistant secretary general of 
the General People's Congress, has cast doubt on the truth of 
the voice recording of the telephone conversation which Aden 
intercepted and attributed to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
which included orders to continue the fighting despite the 
cease-fire announcement. He said that "modern recorders can 
forge anyone's voice. And the phrases I read in AL-SHARQ 
AL-AWSAT contain terms the president does not usually use. 
Anyone's voice can be imitated." 
  He was speaking to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT over the telephone from 
his residence in Paris. [passage omitted] 
  'Abd-al-Ghani said: "We want a dialogue with the brothers in 
the Socialist Party, except those against whom a decision was 
issued by the prosecutor general. We do not believe that the 
Socialist Party is working against unity. It is the elements 
which exploded the situation militarily and squandered the Yemen 
Arab Republic's capabilities." [passage omitted] 
  He pointed out that the "secessionists exploited the 
cease-fire announced on the eve of 'Id al-Adha to safeguard the 
people's lives and capabilities. So they continued their 
rebellion and announced the secession. Then the Security 
Council adopted a resolution, which we accepted for the sake of 
public welfare and to prevent matters from escalating and 
worsening, even though we opposed it on the grounds that the 
crisis is an internal affair. But they still announced the 
formation of a government." 
  He stressed that Sanaa's acceptance of the Security Council 
"proceeds from its emphasis on unity and the sovereignty of the 
Republic of Yemen over all its territory." Then he said: "We 
had wanted from the outset to implement the Security Council 
resolution, but the others' arbitrariness prevented us. And 
when we set a date for the cease-fire, they sent their aircraft 
and naval units to shell the targets of legitimacy, as attested 
by reporters who were present in the sites." 
  He criticized the statement issued in Abha [Saudi Arabia] by 
the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] ministerial council. He 
said, "I do not believe that the position taken by the GCC after 
we did our utmost to improve relations with them is in the 
interests of any state, Is the aim is to settle scores, it is 
erroneous."

  [Text] During its session today under Speaker Shaykh 
'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, the House of Representatives 
listened to a report by Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim 
Basindwah on the political and diplomatic position on the 
current developments in our country. The foreign minister 
explained that many sisterly and friendly states, including the 
UN Security Council permanent member states, support Yemeni 
unity and democracy. He indicated that many of these states 
stress that they cannot deal with a secessionist government, 
that they are not ready to deal with anything outside the 
framework of Yemeni unity, and that what is going on in the 
Yemeni arena is an internal affair that concerns the Yemeni 
people. 
  Addressing deputies, Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim 
Basindwah added: We have in hand very strong cards, represented 
by the fact that Yemeni unity has crowned the Yemeni people's 
longstanding struggle and was achieved peacefully and 
democratically. Afterward, the Republic of Yemen's Constitution 
was put to popular vote, winning full popular support throughout 
the Republic of Yemen. Afterward, general elections were held. 
Those elections, which are the source of constitutional 
legitimacy, have shown which party enjoys more popular support. 
  The foreign minister asked the people's deputies to help 
Yemeni diplomacy in all that serves Yemeni interests and 
supports unity. 
  The deputies expressed extreme appreciation for the Foreign 
Ministry's ability to deal with political issues and anything 
that will support Yemeni unity. 
  Meanwhile, the House stressed that the secessionist 
elements' 
move of forming a secessionist government is null and void, 
deeming it a flagrant insistence by the secessionist clique on 
violating UN Security Council Resolution 924 and a glaring 
breach of the UN Security Council cease-fire resolution, which 
demanded a peaceful settlement within the framework of the 
Republic of Yemen. 
  Earlier, the House listened to and approved the minutes of 
its previous session. The House will continue its work on 
Sunday to discuss a number of issues and topics on the agenda, 
including some financial and supply issues, and other issues 
that will be raised for discussion. The parliamentary committee 
following up the developments experienced by our country will 
complete within three days the tasks that the House has 
entrusted to it. It will submit a report to the House during 
the next session, which will be held Sunday morning, God willing.

<F P=106> [Interview via correspondence with 'Ali Salim al-Bid, </F>
"president of the Democratic Republic of Yemen and secretary 
general of the Socialist Party," in Aden, by Amir Taheri in 
London; date not given] 
  [Text] [Taheri] After the war has entered its fourth 
week, do you believe that resorting to the use of arms was 
unavoidable? 
  [Al-Bid] According to Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar and General 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, who prepared for this war, that is true. 
As for us, we refused to think about or prepare for war. We 
exerted every effort to spare the Yemeni people war, the most 
recent example being the Pledge and Accord Document, which the 
other side rejected completely. Then it pushed Yemen into this 
war, which has destroyed everything: most recently oil, 
economic, and service installations, especially in the capital, 
Aden, despite the Security Council resolution. 
  We are defending, not attacking. We are defending our right 
to live, our honor, our rights, our homes, and our land against 
the barbarous military invasion and occupation. 
  [Taheri] Do you see the current conflict as a civil or 
international war? 
  [Al-Bid] Both cases apply to the current situation in Yemen. 
On the one hand we set up a unified state peacefully, and this 
state needed efforts to complete its structures. It needed to 
be looked after and safeguarded. But the "Shaykh and the 
general" did not comprehend that and remained prisoners of the 
mentality of annexation, looking at the south as a branch that 
had joined the roots and as a field for tax collection, 
usurpation, and obtaining a livelihood. 
  On the other hand, being two completely equal parties, 
regimes, countries, and so on, we are entitled to present our 
case as an international case, as the party represented in the 
Yemen Arab Republic is waging a war. Because the building of 
the new entity still has not been completed, and the reality has 
made it difficult to achieve that, and Sanaa has rejected all 
that Aden is offering or has offered. In fact the situation has 
reached the point of declaring a war to eliminate an entire 
people. So it is a dual matter, as you can see. 
  [Taheri] Are you willing to accept a temporary return to the 
situation that existed before the fighting broke out as a 
condition for a cease-fire, provided it is followed by 
negotiations between the two parties? 
  [Al-Bid] Gen. 'Ali Salih unilaterally declared a state of 
emergency, abolished enforcement of the Constitution, and waged 
a war. What is required is to halt the fighting and create 
normal conditions first and then hold negotiations between the 
two parties that have equal rights and duties. 
  [Taheri] You demanded Arab and international intervention to 
end the war. What is the nature of the intervention you are 
thinking of? Is it supposed to involve peacekeeping forces? 
  [Al-Bid] We support any Arab and international efforts to 
end and halt the war at this point, whether through 
negotiations, by sending observers to withdraw the forces, or, 
if necessary, by sending peacekeeping forces. Because the 
continuation of the war would lead to its escalation and to the 
intervention of parties that do not want stability for the 
region. 
  [Taheri] How would you assess the course of the war so far? 
  [Al-Bid] The course of the war is clear. As far as he ['Ali 
Salih] is concerned, the aim has been defined since he launched 
the war, namely to destroy our military and civilian 
institutions, to occupy the south, and to impose a military 
regime on the two parts of Yemen, especially after the collapse 
of the regime's military "myth" about the existence of a 
"democratic" atmosphere after the achievement of unity and scope 
for the press and free expression. 
  As for our aim, it has always been to defend ourselves 
peacefully under artillery bombardment. We take up the arms 
available to repel the aggressor. 
  [Taheri] Among the proposals mentioned in Western diplomatic 
sources there is one calling for a cease-fire first and a 
general referendum in Yemen on unity within about a year. Do 
you believe that such a formula could form a part of the 
endeavors being made to end the fighting? 
  [Al-Bid] The unity was achieved with a political decision, 
and it was also ended by them with the decision to wage a war on 
us. It is an all-out war in which they have used every dreadful 
and barbarous thing, most recently the fatwa announced the day 
before yesterday on Sanaa radio and issued by someone claiming 
to be a Muslim. He stated that it is lawful to seize southern 
areas. And indeed their forces are doing that and plundering 
everything, raping women and embarking on actions that conflict 
with Islam, ethics, and manhood. 
  It is happening not only in the areas they have occupied, 
but 
also in northern areas, specifically al-Bayda', Ta'izz, Ibb, and 
Ma'rib. 
  It is unrealistic to talk about a referendum while military 
rule and the military option exist. However, we are willing to 
accept it [a referendum] in the southern areas when normal 
conditions are secured under UN supervision. I confirm to you 
our agreement beforehand to what the people in these areas want.

<F P=106> [Interview with Engineer Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, "prime minister </F>
and finance minister in southern Yemen" by correspondents Falih 
al-Saghir and Sa'ud al-Rayyis; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [AL-YAWM] How do you explain the Arab evasion 
concerning the recognition of the Democratic Republic of Yemen 
[DRY]? 
  [Al-'Attas] This is due to the ambiguities of the current 
situation. But now that the issue has been discussed by the UN 
Security Council, I believe the time is very appropriate for 
Arab and friendly countries to explicitly specify their stand in 
order to avert further destruction of our people, which the 
northern leadership carries out. [passage omitted] 
  [AL-YAWM] Do you believe recognition of the DRY will 
increase 
the chances of halting the war? 
  [Al-'Attas] Recognition will keep Sanaa from continuing what 
it insists on carrying out. 
  [AL-YAWM] What is the actual number of dead and homeless? 
  [Al-'Attas] There are no accurate figures about how many 
have been killed. But we estimate the number of dead at 60,000 
and those made homeless at hundreds of thousands. 
  [AL-YAWM] What do you have to say to Sanaa's statement that 
the southern forces were the ones to hit the Aden refinery? 
  [Al-'Attas] Two northern Air Force squadrons, each 
comprising 
four planes, raided the refinery. These are lies. It is very 
shameful for them to resort to such lies. [passage omitted] 
  [AL-YAWM] What about the shortage of medical and food 
supplies? Is there any assistance in this respect? 
  [Al-'Attas] The war in Yemen has resulted in an acute 
shortage of medical and food supplies. We do not have the 
medical supplies needed to treat those wounded in the war that 
was ignited by the Sanaa leadership against our people in the 
south. 
  There is also a shortage of food supplies as a result of the 
war that obstructs their shipment to southern Yemen. We appeal 
to our Arab brothers and our friends to send us medical supplies 
and food. 
  [AL-YAWM] Will you ask Sanaa for war reparations? 
  [Al-'Attas] Certainly. Although the war has harmed all the 
Yemeni people, the Sanaa leadership launched it. [passage 
omitted] 
  [AL-YAWM] Are there foreign elements other than the Iraqis 
within the northern forces? 
  [Al-'Attas] Yes, there are Sudanese elements, beside the 
Iraqis. Iraq assists the northern forces. Jordan also provides 
spare parts for aircraft and other equipment. We have 
information that they received new aircraft and spare parts for 
the Phantoms they have from Jordan. They also received other 
forms of technical assistance and pilots. We know the pilots 
that carry out the raids are not Yemenis but are Iraqis and from 
other nationalities.

  [Text] The Presidential Council in the Democratic Republic 
of Yemen [DRY] has welcomed the statement of the chairman of the 
Security Council and the U.S. State Department, and the 
declaration of al-Akhdar al-Ibrahimi, the UN envoy, concerning 
the full and unconditional commitment to the cease-fire. It 
declared that it will strictly abide by it, and expressed hope 
that the aggressor will cease fire, and stop reinforcement of 
its forces. It added that experiences had proved to the world 
that we have truly complied with the Security Council Resolution 
No. 924 immediately -- it was issued on 1st June 1994, and that 
the Sanaa regime indicated its compliance only on the mass 
media, while it ordered its forces to continue its aggression. 
This is proved by the voice of the head of the Sanaa regime. 
[sentence as received] Therefore, we repeated the necessity of 
the immediate arrival of international observers to control the 
cease-fire and disclose any violations. The Presidential 
Council said that the Security Council Resolution No. 924 and 
the statement of its chairman and the U.S. State Department did 
not put any conditions for the implementation of this 
resolution, while the Sanaa regime is putting preconditions 
which are unacceptable to all. We also declare our preparedness 
to facilitate the mission of the al-Akhdar al-Ibrahimi, and 
cooperate with him in the capital, Aden, while the Sanaa regime 
is delaying him in Sanaa and reinforcing its front positions, 
and moving its hardware in order to continue its aggression. 
  As we declare our commitment to the security council 
resolution, the Sanaa regime continues to launch air raids on 
the vital establishments, including Aden airport, in order to 
hinder its traffic and prevent the arrival of the UN envoy in 
Aden. It also shells at random the civil quarters in Aden and 
the vital establishments.

<F P=106> [Report by Taj-al-Din 'Abd-al-Haqq: "Al-Asnaj: Aden Battle </F>
Will Not Be the Last"] 
  [Excerpt] Abu Dhabi -- 'Abdallah al-Asnaj, foreign 
minister of the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY], has said 
that the Aden battle will not be the last battle between the 
north and the south. And that the sons "of south Yemen, who 
fought British imperialism for many years, will fight the new 
imperialism wrapped in the cloak of unity." 
  In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT prior to his departure 
for Kuwait after a brief visit to the [United Arab] Emirates 
accompanied by Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, prime 
minister of the DRY, al-Asnaj said that the south is not just 
Aden and the battlefield with the Sanaa forces extends to all 
the territory of the DRY. Asked whether he expects open Gulf 
recognition of the DRY, al-Asnaj said: "The issue at present is 
the consolidation of the cease-fire, which Sanaa tries to get 
around every time." 
  He said that what Sanaa says publicly conflicts with what it 
is doing on the ground, as it is continuing the aggression, 
hitting residential areas. 
  He added that the DRY has appealed to the UN secretary 
general to compel the Sanaa rulers to respect Security Council 
Resolution 924 and to observe the cease-fire by deed, not word. 
  He pointed out that DRY services have intercepted telephone 
conversations in the voice of the Sanaa ruler, in which he urges 
his forces to speed up their military operations and destroy 
villages and residential areas. 
  Asked whether al-'Attas will request Gulf and Arab 
recognition of the DRY during his current tour, al-Asnaj said: 
"The recognition issue depends on our steadfastness on the 
ground." He pointed out that fraternal and friendly states "are 
awaiting [the outcome of] current developments in Yemen to 
announce that." 
  He said that the international community sympathizes with 
the 
right to self-determination for south Yemen. It also condemns 
the aggressive operations launched by the Sanaa government. 
  Al-Asnaj praised the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] 
resolution issued at the GCC foreign ministers meeting. He said 
the resolution contains an open call for a cease-fire and for 
renouncing the use of force, and is in line with Security 
Council Resolution 924. 
  Asked whether southern forces have received military aid 
from 
Arab states, al-Asnaj said, "we are aware of regional conditions 
and do appreciate them. We are asking for nothing at this stage 
beyond condemnation and work to halt the continuing war launched 
by the Sanaa rulers." 
  On his assessment of the U.S. role, al-Asnaj said: "We are 
in touch with the United States and the permanent member states 
of the Security Council." He also said: "We are satisfied with 
the U.S. position, which is in line with the position declared 
by the GCC states." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Fax interview with Salim Salih Muhammad, assistant </F>
secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP) and member 
of the Aden Presidential Council, in London; by an unidentified 
AL-SHIRA' correspondent in Beirut; date not given] 
  [Text] [AL-SHIRA'] Was your presence and that of other 
south Yemeni leaders abroad when the war broke out a coincidence 
or was it planned? 
  [Muhammad] I was on a mission to brief Arab presidents and 
kings on the other side's preparations for war and to appeal to 
them to intervene to prevent it. The other party, however, went 
ahead with its preparations and the war broke out while I was 
receiving medical treatment in London. 
  [AL-SHIRA'] What were your expectations before going abroad? 
How do you view the military situation now? What areas are 
under 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's control and what areas remain in 
your hands? 
  [Muhammad] When Yemeni unity was peacefully and 
democratically attained, certain influential circles in Sanaa 
were not happy with the way it was brought about. So they 
created difficulties and challenges from the first day, 
including assassinations, the abolishing of the new state's 
institutions, involvement in the Gulf war, undermining the 
economy, and finally making the decision to begin the current 
war. There is now fighting in Ta'izz, Lahij, Abyan, Shabwah, 
and Ma'rib. The two capital cities are subjected to missile 
attacks and air raids. The northerners are losing thousands of 
troops and hundreds of tanks and other vehicles for every small 
advance they make into al-'Anad Base or Abyan. No matter how 
many areas 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih controls, the logic of force and 
its consequences are unacceptable. The outcome of occupation 
and invasion will be overturned sooner or later. An examination 
of Yemeni history will illustrate this point. 
  [AL-SHIRA'] Are you preparing yourselves for a war of 
attrition? Where are you getting the weapons? 
  [Muhammad] We did not begin the war. We do not want war at 
all. The area that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih is now invading fought 
off the British Empire, the Turks, and the Portuguese. It has 
been a graveyard for invaders. There is strong resistance 
despite the ferocity of the battles. 
  [AL-SHIRA'] Are you afraid Aden will turn into another 
Sarajevo? 
  [Muhammad] Although our army is much smaller and our areas 
are less populous than the north, the heroic steadfastness of 
our warriors has upset their numerical superiority. Aden's 
quicksand and mighty waves will drown the forces they are 
massing to attack the city. 
  [AL-SHIRA'] Why has the oil not been attacked yet? 
  [Muhammad] We respect the investments and interests of 
others. We have the capability to hit Ma'rib and al-Hudaydah but 
we wish to protect the Yemeni people's interests and other 
people's interests. The other side, however, has struck at these 
interests by hitting Aden's refineries and is trying to approach 
and control the oil installations in Shabwah. 
  [AL-SHIRA'] Was there no alternative to your separation? 
  [Muhammad] What other response do you expect from people who 
find war, destruction, and death imposed on them? What other 
option is there? 
  [AL-SHIRA'] Don't you think that giving up power for the 
sake 
of unity is a worthwhile sacrifice? 
  [Muhammad] We were idealists and gave up power for the sake 
of unity. We accepted a two-way and even a three-way 
partnership and believed that this idealism would find a 
favorable response. The bitter facts proved that the other side 
wished to dominate us, abolish our rights, and monopolize 
everything. We discovered that the unity we had dreamed of was 
not realized in substance or form. We will leave this to 
political analysts to judge later and decide which side wanted 
unity and which side is actually separatist. 
  [AL-SHIRA'] Have you been using the tactic of luring the 
northerners to the south to prolong the war and sap their 
capabilities for a political purpose? Are you trying to get 
Arab-international intervention that will formalize the current 
status? 
  [Muhammad] The next few days will answer this question. 
  [AL-SHIRA'] What is the actual U.S. position on the issue? 
Is it true that coordination between you and the United States 
began when [Yemeni Socialist Party Secretary General] 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid visited the United States and met with U.S. Vice 
President Al Gore? 
  [Muhammad] We hope that the U.S. attitude will be consistent 
with the U.S. position on the new world order and its views on 
democracy, human rights, renunciation of violence and terrorism, 
rejection of military dictatorship, and respect for all nations' 
mutual economic interests on an equal basis. The Sanaa party 
does not respect these principles, judging by its atrocious 
conduct before and during the war. 
  [AL-SHIRA'] How do you assess the roles played by the Arab 
countries? 
  [Muhammad] There is no effective Arab role. It has been 
paralyzed since the Gulf war. The Egyptian, Saudi, Syrian, and 
Emirian appeals to end the fighting are welcome but what we 
actually need is a firm Arab position to end the war and make 
the two parties accept dialogue to reach solutions satisfactory 
to both sides. As to the Iraqi position on the issue, the 
statement issued by the National Command [of the Iraqi Arab 
Ba'th Socialist Party] and the attitudes shown by their 
representatives at the Arab League demonstrates Iraq's position. 
Iraqi officials are also making visits and sending Republican 
Guard experts and experts in other fields to the north. We used 
to believe that Iraq was concerned with improving its poor 
economic conditions instead of meddling in other people's 
affairs but it appears that the militarist mentality that ruined 
many of our Arab countries is now shared by the Iraqi regime and 
the Sanaa regime. 
  [AL-SHIRA'] When will the Arabs and the world recognize you? 
Why has this recognition been delayed? 
  [Muhammad] Arab and international circles acknowledge that 
there are two Yemens. Recognition that we are two equal parties 
exists. How else would you explain the referral of this issue 
to the Arab League and the UN Security Council? The 
representatives of south Yemen were accorded the same level of 
reception as the representatives of the north.

  [Text] An official source in the Democratic Republic of 
Yemen [DRY] welcomed the American stand concerning the necessity 
of Sanaa's obligations to the UN Security Council's resolution 
on cease-fire and not to impose unity by force. 
  In a statement to the Yemeni news agency, Aden, the source 
also praised the communique of the Arab Gulf countries, members 
of the Cooperation Council, and the communique of the ARE [Arab 
Republic of Egypt] expressing thanks to the fraternals in the 
Gulf and Egypt for their positive stand which shows eagerness 
about Yemen's land and people. 
  The source added: We announce our thanks to the Arab 
community and the world community, which rejected the law of 
force, destruction and bloodshed, and we would like to confirm 
our obligation to the Security Council Resolution No. 924 and 
that Sanaa is trying to deceive the world just as it did in the 
night of the blessed 'Id al-Adha when it announced a cease-fire 
and gave its orders to its forces to resume fighting. 
  The source said: We are picking up signals of orders by the 
head of the Sanaa regime to these forces in the fighting fronts 
to regather and mobilize themselves in an offensive position on 
our country. And, as for us, we will commit ourselves to the 
resolution of the world community and we will not do any 
military action except in defense against the awaited attack.

  [Text] Military sources in Aden have revealed one of the 
barbaric methods used by the military command in Sanaa with the 
pilots who carry out air raids on the Democratic Republic of 
Yemen. The same sources told the YEMENI NEWS AGENCY, Aden, that 
the Air Force Command of the bloody al-Ahmar family is making 
the ejectable seats on military planes inoperative. These seats 
are used by pilots to bail out when their planes have been hit. 
  The sources added that this method used by the influential 
military commands without the pilots' knowledge confirms the 
disregard these commands have for the lives of the pilots who 
carry out these savage raids. These sources recalled a similar 
method used by Iraqi military commands with their pilots during 
the Gulf War and said that this method currently used by the 
military commands in Sanaa confirm beyond any doubt the 
involvement of Iraqi military expertise in the dirty war waged 
by the al-Ahmar gang against the Democratic Republic of Yemen.

  [Text] Salih Abu-Bakr Bin-Husaynun, the minister of oil 
and minerals and military commander of the interior axis, 
praised the state of Kuwait's principled stand. He praised 
Kuwait's press for its covering of the events. Mr. Bin-Husaynun 
said in a contact with the AL-QABAS newspaper, published today, 
that the northern forces had attacked yesterday morning the 
southern forces at al-'Akbar/Askar axis, and that after violent 
fighting several northern tanks were destroyed and 11 soldiers 
were taken prisoner. Bin- Husaynun said that the battle on this 
axis had begun on 2 June, when the Maghawir forces tried to 
infiltrate into Khash'in al-Ayn, and were repelled by our forces 
after fierce fighting. Our Armed Forces destroyed a tank 
squadron and took 15 soldiers prisoner. The enemy ran away, 
leaving back a number of artillery, and killed and injured 
soldiers. Last Tuesday [7 June] the northern forces launched an 
attack, despite the cease-fire declaration. The enemy suffered 
the destruction of seven tanks, and the death of soldiers and 
imprisoning of others, and the shooting down of a MiG-21 
warplane.

    [Editorial Report] The following review of the 31 May issue 
of Cairo 'AQIDATI summerizes articles that are Islamic in nature. 
<H5>  Contents: </H5>
  1. 'Ulemas Talking to Repentant Youths Interviewed 
  2. Mufti Reconciled With Opponents 
  3. Awqaf Minister Reports on Pilgrimage 
  4. Pilgrims, Saudi Government Blamed for Mecca Chaos 
  5. Columnist on Uselessness of Dialogue With Repentant 
Youths 
  6. Al-Azhar Shaykh Notes Need To Educate Youths in Islam 
  7. Article Terms Age `Age of Dialogue' 
  8. Islamic Media Evaluated as Low-Voiced 
  9. Islamic University Professor Interviewed 
  10. Columnist Angry Over Media Unfairness Toward Egypt 
  11. Chief Editor Defends Newspaper's Stances on Islam 
<H5>  'ULEMAS TALKING TO REPENTANT YOUTHS INTERVIEWED </H5>
  Page 1 carries a summarized 150-word report on the 
"dialogue" 
recently broadcast over television between 'ulemas and 
professors from al-Azhar University and "repentant youths." The 
moderator of the dialogue was Hilmi al-Buluk, who explains the 
"secrets behind this dialogue" to 'AQIDATI. He says the idea of 
a dialogue was born "when a large number of youths announced 
that they have returned to the correct and righteous religion 
and renounced extremism." 
  Pages 10 and 11 carry a detailed report on interviews with 
Hilmi al-Buluk and some of the 'ulemas and professors who 
participated in the dialogue. Al-Buluk says: "The idea of 
holding these meetings stemmed from the desire of a group of 
youths currently serving their prison sentences to discuss their 
experiences. We immediately responded to this need." He 
maintains that when the dialogue went on for over six and a half 
hours, he offered to stop it, but the youths themselves were 
keen on continuing. He explains how the 'ulemas who conducted 
this dialogue were chosen. "The 'ulemas for the most recent 
meetings were professors at al-Azhar University, who are, 
undoubtedly, highly educated and well-versed in jurisprudence, 
each in his own field," al-Buluk adds. 
  Dr. Nash'at 'Abd-al-Jawad, professor of philosophy and 
doctrine at al-Azhar University, claims that the "responsibility 
for aggravating this extremist thinking is a joint one between 
al-Azhar and the state." He accuses the state of not having 
"paid any attention to al-Azhar's 'ulemas, and placed them in 
the tenth rank." The state realized it had to find another way 
to confront this problem, he says, so it resorted to freedom of 
expression of ideas and discussion with clarity and frankness. 
It "could not find anyone better than the al-Azhar 'ulemas to 
express themselves in this language," 'Abd-al-Jawad states. He 
concludes that they were interested in listening to the youths 
and in making the youths hear their opinions, "and whoever is 
more capable of convincing the other party will obviously win, 
and that course will be adopted." 
  Dr. Muhammad 'Abd-al-Sami' Jad, professor of Islamic call 
and 
education, clarifies: "The most important short-term result of 
this open dialogue and frank discussion is the response of these 
youths whose minds were fogged up. The long-term results 
include the increased turnout of the youths to such meetings of 
their own free will to rectify their thinking after realizing 
the error in their ways. Officials in all sectors must increase 
the number of such meetings because the youth comprise 60 
percent of Egypt's population." 
  Jad accuses those who initially called for dwarfing the role 
of al-Azhar and its 'ulemas, and distancing them from 
participating in and expressing their opinion on events, of 
being the major reason for spreading such erroneous thinking. 
"It is time," he announces, "for people to get the correct 
Islamic knowledge from the true source and from the specialized 
'ulemas." 
  Dr. Muhammad 'Abd-al-Fadil al-Qawsi, another religion 
professor at Cairo University, explains that from this dialogue 
emerged the fact that these youths were misinterpreting a set of 
Koranic verses stipulating how the government should be run. He 
maintains that certain factors-- unemployment, lack of religious 
awareness--made them susceptible to influence from any ideas 
cloaked with a veneer of religion. He also stresses that the 
Islamic media could be an eye-opener for these youths and could 
guide them back to the path of righteousness. The report 
concludes with a statement by al-Azhar Professor Dr. Isma'il 
al-Daftar who says that they are always ready to talk to the 
youths if given the chance to do so. 
<H5>  MUFTI RECONCILED WITH OPPONENTS </H5>
  Page 1 also carries a short 100-word report by Mahmud 'Ushub 
that 'AQIDATI has learned that al-Azhar University professors 
have managed to reconcile Mufti of the Republic Muhammad Sayyid 
Tantawi with Dr. Sha'ban Isma'il and others regarding the 
dispute between them, which had reached the courts. Both sides 
have agreed to resolve the matter out of court. 
<H5>  AWQAF MINISTER REPORTS ON PILGRIMAGE </H5>
  A 100-word report on page 1 says the awqaf minister is 
preparing a detailed report for the prime minister on the 
activities of this year's pilgrimage delegation to Mecca. The 
report contains the positive and negative aspects of this 
pilgrimage. It also proposes forming an independent agency to 
organize the Egyptian pilgrimage. 
<H5>  PILGRIMS, SAUDI GOVERNMENT BLAMED FOR MECCA CHAOS </H5>
  Samir Rajab's 400-word column "Rightfully I Say" on page 1 
blames both the pilgrims and the Saudi Arabian Government for 
the chaos during the pilgrimage in Mecca, which leads to many 
deaths each year. He says the Saudi Arabian Government should 
organize processions better. He calls for improving conditions 
at the pilgrimage site. 
<H5>  COLUMNIST ON USELESSNESS OF DIALOGUE WITH REPENTANT YOUTHS </H5>
  Basyuni al-Halawani's 700-word column "In All Frankness" on 
page 6 entitled "Dialogue With the Repentant Youths and the 
Morals We Have Learned" maintains that this dialogue is useless 
since these youths have already joined the righteous path. He 
proposes that "effective dialogue from which we expect results 
should be with the other elements who still believe in the ideas 
of violence and extremism." Continuing, he recommends that 
confronting terrorism should take place on many levels. Once 
the security level succeeds, confronting extremist and terrorist 
thinking is the responsibility of the 'ulemas and Islamic 
intellectuals. "The real confrontation of extremist thinking," 
he concludes, "dictates that we should confront those people who 
hoist slogans on the freedom of thinking and expression and 
attack everything that is Islamic. They are no less dangerous 
than the terrorists who carry arms and kill innocent people." 
<H5>  AL-AZHAR SHAYKH NOTES NEED TO EDUCATE YOUTHS IN ISLAM </H5>
  Page 7 carries an article by al-Azhar Shaykh Jad-al-Haqq 
'Ali 
Jad-al-Haqq who advocates that the youth in Egypt should be 
taken care of and educated properly in religion so that they do 
not misinterpret religious texts or behave contrary to God's 
teachings. He cites many Koranic verses with regard to this 
point. He concludes that the first and final reference for 
correct Muslim behavior is the Koran itself and that by reading 
it and following its teachings correctly, we will be guided by 
its light. 
<H5>  ARTICLE TERMS AGE `AGE OF DIALOGUE' </H5>
  An article on page 11 entitled "The Age of Dialogue and 
Reconciliation Thinking" signed by the initials M.Y. praises the 
dialogue between al-Azhar 'ulemas and repentant terrorists. The 
writer notes: "With the number of returning youths, the Islamic 
call has gained a new group of people who have kept company with 
deviant thinkers, and learned about them and about their 
objectives and secrets. Therefore, they will be more competent 
and effective in spreading the call among their former brothers 
who have yet to return to the righteous path." The writer also 
notes that the preparatory meeting to form the national dialogue 
committee was held at the same time. "Both these meetings and 
others," he concludes, "clarify that we are now in an age that 
we can safely call the `Age of Dialogue.' Experience has proven 
to us that dialogue is the only way out for a nation from its 
crisis and problems." 
<H5>  ISLAMIC MEDIA EVALUATED AS LOW-VOICED </H5>
  Page 18 is dedicated to Islamic media issues. In a 250-word 
report, Muhammad 'Abd-al-Sami' Shabanah, counselor at al-Azhar, 
evaluated Islamic media, claiming that it has "a very low 
voice." However, he believes that in comparison to other forms 
of media, the radio is "splendid." He then claims that visual 
Islamic media needs a great deal of work in order to rise to the 
required level. 
<H5>  ISLAMIC UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR INTERVIEWED </H5>
  Page 20 features an interview by Tariq 'Abdallah with Dr. 
'Abd- al-'Aziz al-'Ubaydi, professor of Islamic history at the 
social sciences college in al-Imam Muhammad Bin Sa'ud Islamic 
University. He analyzes the dangers to the Islamic nation from 
outside, such as cultural and economic siege imposed by the 
enemy, and from inside such as inter-Muslim differences. 
<H5>  COLUMNIST ANGRY OVER MEDIA UNFAIRNESS TOWARD EGYPT </H5>
  The same page carries a 200-word column by 'Adil Dayf in 
which he expresses his anger over the media's unfairness in 
reporting acts of violence in Egypt, as compared to reporting in 
the United States, Europe, Russia, and the former Soviet 
republics. He concludes that the reason for this is: "The 
media's total bias to the West, total disregard for our nation, 
and complete hostility to us." He addresses western media 
asking them "not only to be fair, but to be just and to reveal 
the truth, no more." He closes his column by claiming that 
security in Egypt is much better than that in any other

<H5>  CHIEF EDITOR DEFENDS NEWSPAPER'S STANCES ON ISLAM </H5>
  On the back page of 'AQIDATI, Chief Editor Al-Sayyid 
'Abd-al-Ra'uf writes his "A Call To Reason" column in which he 
defends his newspaper and refutes claims that it is the 
"civilian wing of terrorism." He highlights the fact that the 
newspaper's objective from the beginning was to enlighten people 
about true Islam. He uses the recent dialogue between the 
'ulemas and repentant terrorists as an example to show that the 
'ulemas are the prime source on Islam. The 'ulemas are the ones 
"capable of guiding our youths, who have the seeds for real 
belief in their hearts, by the hand from the path of sin to the 
path of righteousness, from hostility to society to 
reconciliation with it, from killing and destruction to repair 
and construction." Defending the 'ulemas' role in educating the 
people and propagating the true religion, he concludes: "These 
dialogues very clearly order the rats of culture to go into 
their holes or stop their fervent screams heard by no one but 
themselves."

  [Excerpts] Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul has asserted 
that the Lebanese Army is not stopping the resistance because 
the resistance is carrying out activities against the 
occupation. He affirmed the official Lebanese stance that when 
Israel withdraws from the south, the Army will be ready to take 
on its security duties. We guarantee that there will not be any 
operations against Israel through the south. Minister Dallul 
today received doyen of Lebanese editors Milhim Karam, who 
interviewed him on current issues. [passage omitted] 
  On the Army's preparedness to assume all security duties in 
the country, Minister Dallul said the Army has progressed a 
great deal, but we are preparing it to be able to restore 
security to the south when Israel withdraws. [passage omitted] 
  Doyen Karam asked whether the Army was strong enough in the 
south, especially after some U.S. doubts about this were voiced 
by Ambassador Hambley. Dallul answered: If the United States 
or Ambassador Hambley are suggesting that the Army is not 
confronting the resistance, then this true, because the 
resistance is carrying out activities against the occupation. 
Does Washington want us to strike at the resistance in the 
interest of the occupation? The Army's deployment in the south 
is strong and extensive. When Israel withdraws, the United 
States will see that the guarantees we are talking about are 
serious. But for us to turn into a police force that protects 
the occupier is something we shall not do. It would be treason 
to our country. 
  Minister Dallul denied that the Government has any 
information about Israeli pilot Ron Arad. When his plane was 
downed, there was no legitimate authority in Lebanon. We all 
know that, he said. 
  He added that extensive investigations are taking place with 
regard to those who cooperated with Israel by allegedly leading 
the occupants of the two Israeli aircraft to al-Dirani's home to 
kidnap him. The defense minister refused to discuss judicial 
investigations regarding the assassination of [Dany] Sham'un and 
the church blast, because this is a judicial matter. 
  With regard to holding Ja'ja' in the Defense Ministry, he 
said: As defense minister, I have to allocate one of the prisons 
belonging to the ministry in which to hold the prisoner. So I 
chose the Defense Ministry's building so that he can be properly 
interrogated, and for his own sake. As for the way he is being 
treated, it has become well-known: He asks for juice, toast, or 
yogurt, and gets whatever he wants. The orders for the food he 
wants are placed in the name of the officers guarding him rather 
than in his own name in order to protect him. I believe that 
his life is more secure inside the Defense Ministry prison than 
anywhere else. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Algerian Foreign Minister 
Mohamed Salah Dembri delivered a speech which revolved around 
the issues of Palestine and Middle East issues. The main points 
of this address are in a report prepared by Mohamed Soukou: 
  [Begin Soukou recording] In his address to the OAU foreign 
ministers, Mohamed Salah Dembri highlighted Algeria's support 
for the Palestinian people's struggle to regain their legitimate 
national rights, considering the Washington agreement on 
self-rule in Gaza and Jericho as the first step toward imposing 
peace in the Middle East region. 
  On the other hand, he considered the agreement signed in 
Cairo on the implementation of this verdict an important 
achievement toward the establishment of Palestinian authority in 
reality within the framework of an independent Palestinian state 
with Jerusalem as its capital. 
  When he reviewed the situation in the Middle East, Dembri 
pointed out that Algeria saw that the peace process in the 
Middle East necessarily hinged on a comprehensive Israeli 
withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories. 
  At the end of his speech, Dembri called on the African 
countries to send a collective call to the peace-loving 
countries in the Middle East and the international community to 
support the peace process in the region. [end recording]

  [Text] Washington, 10 Jun (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak 
has stated that the Jewish settlements in the occupied 
Palestinian territories and the Jerusalem issue are the most 
critical problems confronting the Middle East peace process. 
Regarding the settlements, he said everything depends on how 
the Israelis and the Palestinians handle this issue, which is 
more difficult and complicated now than it used to be when the 
Camp David Accords were signed. As to Jerusalem, the president 
emphasized its special status among the adherents of Islam, 
Christianity, and Judaism all of whom attach a sacred character 
to the city. 
  These remarks came in an interview conducted by the 
well-known television commentator Dan Rather and broadcast by 
CBS Television early today. 
  In response to a question, President Mubarak said that 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat wishes to go to Jericho but 
is delaying the trip until the funds he promised the 
Palestinians become available because it will be difficult for 
him to go there "empty-handed." 
  President Mubarak emphatically denied any prospect of 
Egypt's 
becoming "another Iran." He declared: "Egypt cannot turn into 
an Iran or any other country. It is an ancient country with 
very deep roots and a 7,000-year old civilization." 
  He added: "We are able to confront terrorist acts in this 
country." 
  Concerning the greatest current threat to the peace 
operation, President Mubarak said: "The main obstacle is the 
settlements and how the Palestinians and Israelis handle this 
issue." 
  Asked if that is the primary problem, President Mubarak 
said: 
"Yes. I remember that there were 48 small settlements when the 
Camp David Accords were signed. Now there are 180 settlements 
and this makes the problem much more difficult and complicated 
than ever before. Also, there is the Jerusalem issue which is a 
sacred place for Arabs, Muslims, Christians, and Jews." 
  On whether he doubts Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat 
will 
go to Jericho this month, his excellency replied: "I recently 
heard that he is ready to go but is postponing the trip until 
the aid funds become available. I believe he wishes to go but 
if he arrives there empty-handed, it will be a very difficult 
matter for his people to accept." 
  Asked if Yasir 'Arafat will able to govern after a life of 
armed struggle, President Mubarak said: "Let's be realistic. 
'Arafat is facing tremendous difficulties but he is the best 
man for this mission now. I know him very well." 
  In answer to a question about whether Yasir 'Arafat can do 
what Nelson Mandela did in South Africa, namely forgive, 
President Mubarak said: "I believe that 'Arafat is willing to 
forgive. They can unite and cooperate for the good of the 
people." 
  On whether he thinks it is time to reduce the economic 
sanctions on Iraq, although President Saddam Husayn is still in 
power, President Mubarak remarked: "It is a problem. We 
sympathize with the suffering Iraqi nation but not with Saddam 
Husayn himself." 
  In answer to a question on whether he favors selling Iraqi 
oil on the international market at this time, his excellency 
said: "If it is for the people's good and if the revenue from 
such sales can be controlled and used to bring prosperity to the 
people, then I agree." 
  Asked if Iran poses a major threat to regional peace and 
security, President Mubarak said: "The Iranians are dead set 
against the peace process." 
  Regarding the possibility that Egypt might turn into another 
Iran, President Mubarak said: "Egypt will never be another Iran 
or any other country. Egypt is a country with a long history 
and a 7,000-year civilization. We are quite able to confront 
terrorist acts in this country."

  [Text] A spokesman for the U.S. State Department has voiced 
his government's belief that Sudan harbors members of what he 
described as international terrorist organizations. It is well 
known that Western countries -- foremost among them the United 
States -- are the ones who harbor terrorist organizations, 
provide them with weapons, and allow them to train on their 
territory. The United States and other Western countries are 
the ones who abet the leaders of these terrorist organizations 
and send them to carry out assassinations, acts of subversion, 
and destabilization plots in many parts of the world.

  [Text] The United Nations has announced the postponement of 
the voter identification operation with regard to the 
self-determination referendum in Western Sahara. Our 
correspondent has more details: 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Voter identification for those 
who are to take part in the self-determination referendum in 
Western Sahara, which was supposed to begin today in Laayoune, 
has been postponed until next week for logistical reasons. The 
United Nations announced the news from Rabat today, confirming 
that the transportation of Moroccan and Saharan notables to 
registration locations raised some technical problems. 
  According to a UN-Moroccan joint statement signed at the end 
of May in Rabat by the Moroccan interior minister and Erik 
Jenssen, acting special envoy of the UN secretary general, all 
Saharans concerned with the referendum had been informed that 
voter identification would begin today in Laayoune.

<F P=106> [News conference by President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani </F>
with domestic and foreign media correspondents in Tehran on 7 
June -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] In the name of God, the 
compassionate, the merciful. I will not give an introduction. 
I shall wait for questions from reporters so that we make more 
use of the time. You can start. 
  [Unidentified correspondent, in English with superimposed 
Persian translation] I have two questions. My first question 
is, how do you see the international oil market? My second 
question is, has there been any improvement in the relations 
between Iran and the United States after the visit of the 
American journalists? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] About oil, it seems the rest of the 
year 
will be the same, or a little better. About the second 
question. I do not think the presence of editors of American 
press in Iran would have any fundamental effect on relations. 
It could only clarify more the truths for the Americans. We 
shall have to see what conclusions they draw from those truths. 
  [GUARDIAN correspondent, name indistinct] Two questions. 
First of all, does the Iranian Government believe Britain's 
policy on former Yugoslavia precludes the creation of a strong 
country by Bosnian Muslims? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] In that respect there is evidence the 
British Government does not cooperate properly in repelling 
Serbian acts of aggression. Of course, final judgement should 
be based on further investigation, or one should wait for the 
future. 
  [GUARDIAN correspondent] Second question. What is the 
president's reaction to the remarks by Mr. Zhirinovskiy in the 
Soviet Union who said we have to go south, which includes Iran? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] We consider those remarks as those of 
an 
irresponsible person. We attach no value to them for us to show 
an official reaction. 
  [KUNA correspondent, name indistinct, in Arabic] Hello. 
During your meeting with the students and teaching staff of 
Amir Kabir industrial university last week, you accused the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia of creating trouble and annoyance to 
some of its neighbors, including Iraq. Your Excellency, you 
know very well that the Iraqi regime was, and still is, the 
source of problems in the region. It started with its 
aggression against Iran in 1980, with the ambition of seizing 
the oil wells of Khuzestan and under the pretext of defending 
the eastern gate of the Arab nation. It then used chemical 
weapons against the Kurds in north Iraq, in Halabja. Then 
followed the invasion of Kuwait and the various immoral and 
inhuman crimes it committed there. It also committed various 
crimes against the Iraqi people in the north and in the south 
and has continued, up to the present, to use tanks, guns, and 
aircraft against its people. Would it be more beneficial, Your 
Excellency, if, instead of accusing the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 
of creating problems for Iraq, you had offered advice to the 
tyrant of Baghdad to abide by the international resolutions 
pertaining to the recognition of the sovereignty of the state of 
Kuwait, its independence, and its international borders. 
  This is the first question. If you allow me I have another 
question. It was also during your meeting with the students and 
lecturers of Amir Kabir university when you said satellite 
technology would not constitute an obstacle in the way of our 
exporting the Islamic revolution. Your Excellency, such 
utterances about the export of the revolution were made by some 
Iranian officials at the beginning of the revolution and caused 
a cooling in the relations and a schism between Iran and its 
neighbors in the region. Your Excellency, why is there this 
insistence on making such slogans concerning the export of the 
revolution? It had been better if you had concentrated your 
efforts on rebuilding Iran and overcoming its economic and 
social problems. Thank you. 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] About his first question, we have 
already -- both verbally and practically -- condemned Iraq's 
acts of aggression, and we still do. Iraq -- and particularly 
the Ba'thist party of Iraq -- has acted very badly towards its 
own people, us, and the people of Kuwait. About the question on 
Saudi Arabia, we have said Saudi Arabia is not doing the right 
thing to save the people of Iraq, and they are not coordinating 
their effort to resolve the Iraqi issue. 
  About his second question, it was not a question of 
exporting 
the revolution, as they are constantly accusing us. The 
question was, that with the existence of foreign satellites in 
Iran, how do we raise the issue of exporting the ideology of the 
Islamic revolution? I have said that we put forward our ideology 
whether there are any satellites or not. That is what we have 
always said. We have never said we would take our revolution to 
other countries. We say we put forward our ideas, and if 
anybody is interested, they could accept those ideas. Followers 
of any ideology would do the same. It is not interfering in the 
affairs of others. In practice we are now using all our 
facilities to build our own country; we do not use them abroad. 
  [Ghoroghi, Iranian TV correspondent] In the name of God, 
the compassionate, the merciful. Mr. President, regarding the 
discovery of a bugging device at the Iranian Embassy in London, 
could you say how Tehran-London relations will be from now on? 
Furthermore, the information minster has announced that the 
greater dimensions of the affair will be revealed later. Could 
you expand on this issue if possible? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] Well, the information minister will 
later announce in an appropriate time what he intends to say. 
However, the consequence of the British violation has created 
insecurity in relations and an atmosphere of mistrust, which is 
negative. We do not wish to see the creation of insecurity and 
mistrust among countries that have representation in other 
countries. 
  [Ghorighi] With regards to foreign currency fluctuations, 
how 
do you see the implementation of the policy on the single 
currency rate, which started last year? And from a government 
point of view, what is the price for a regulated foreign 
currency and when will it be successful? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] The new policies we announced as of 
last 
week are a continuation of the single-currency-rate policies. 
With these policies we intend to regulate demand and supply in 
the market to allow the actual realization of a single rate. We 
predict that in the coming months and with regulation of demand 
and supply in the market, the real price of currency will become 
clear. But it is not possible to predict precisely. I think 
the price will be less than what it is in the free market now. 
  [Takashi] Hello, Mr. Hashemi. I am Japanese correspondent 
Takashi. I have one question. Three years from now your 
excellency's term of presidency will come to an end, and under 
the Constitution you will have to step aside. Do you wish to 
continue, or make certain changes in the Constitution to enable 
you to continue your presidency? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] Those quiet Japanese make such a hue 
and 
cry. It is interesting. [Hashemi-Rafsanjani laughs] We would 
rather the Constitution were not changed and implement it as is. 
If I carry out my duties well during these eight years, I think 
there would be no need for my re-election and matters would, God 
willing, progress. 
  [Amiriyan, IRNA correspondent] I have two questions for your 
Excellency. The first is, what is the situation regarding 
privatization and the private sector in the country, and how far 
have things progressed regarding attracting foreign investments? 
My second question is, are Dr. Velayati's visit to Egypt and 
his talks with his Egyptian counterpart signs of change in 
Iran's Middle East policy? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] [passage omitted] About foreign 
investment, it is permissible under our laws, and we are 
agreeable. If some people wish to invest in Iran within the 
bounds of our laws and constitution, they would be accepted. 
  About Dr. Velayati's trip to Egypt, it is not a change in 
our 
Middle East policy. First, travelling to Egypt has never been 
forbidden. Our ministers have gone there in the past; Egyptian 
ministers have also come to Iran. Those comings and goings will 
continue. Second, the nonaligned movement session was there. 
Irrespective of relations with the host country, it was natural 
for Iran, which is an effective country in the nonaligned 
movement, to have an active participation in it. When the 
United Nations has a session in America, we take part. As you 
have seen, that happens every year. 
  [Notalli Nowari, LIBERATION correspondent, in English] Mr. 
President, I have two questions. My first question concerns 
satellite television, which you mentioned earlier. I wonder 
whether his excellency has watched any satellite television 
programs? Do you think the programs on satellite television are 
a threat to the youths in this country and should be banned? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] This is a new issue in our country and 
has created various discussions by people with various tastes. 
As you are aware, a draft bill has been put forward in the 
islamic majles. naturally, the deputies have the opportunity to 
discuss it there, and you too will hear the discussions through 
the majles. Our regime's view will be the majles's outcome. 
  [Nowari] What is your position? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] I do not want to express any view 
before 
that discussion becomes ripe, because our prejudgement might 
influence the views. We expect the views to be expressed freely 
and the issue to become clear to the people. We will make a 
decision at the appropriate time. 
  [Nowari] I am sorry to insist, but you did not answer my 
question of whether you yourself had watched satellite TV? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] I do not have that much time to sit and 
watch television. I might watch sometimes if an opportunity 
presents itself and there is something interesting. 
  [Heydarzadah, ETTELA'AT correspondent] Please, could you say 
whether Iranian diplomacy in Central Asia has so far been 
successful despite American measures and the fact that they 
threw wrench in the work? How do you assess the 
political-economic prospect of these relations? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] Please repeat. 
  [Heydarzadah] [repeats question] 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] We think the grounds for cooperation 
between Iran and Central Asian countries are so vast, natural, 
and essential that no one can prevent them. It is possible 
their dimensions may be reduced occasionally as a result of 
foreign pressure. But, Iran and Central Asia naturally complete 
[mokamal] each other. They need many things we have in Iran, 
and we need many things they have. The proper routes that 
connect Central Asia to the rest of the world pass through Iran. 
We are in the process of connecting the railway system. We 
have joined land routes. Customs offices have been set up. 
Airline routes and sea routes and communication systems have 
been set up. No one can change these facts. 
  [Muhammad Baqir Shar'i, correspondent of Beirut's AL-DIYAR, 
in Arabic] I am very interested in Iran and the Islamic 
revolution, and I come from a country which is very interested 
in your country and nation. My question is that, as it was you 
who proposed Khamene'i to the post of the leadership of Islamic 
revolution, is the relation between the two of you still of a 
special nature? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] I do not think that any one who knows 
us 
can have any doubt about the fact that my relation with the 
eminent leader is one of the most cordial and sincere relations 
which can exist between two human beings. We have been together 
in the fronts of struggle for more than 40 years now. Since the 
revolution, too, we have always been together. 
  Even before the demise of the Imam, the arrogant media used 
to talk of my differences with Khamene'i. At that time, I said 
during a Friday prayer sermon: We are so close in our tastes and 
ideas that I am prepared to sign a blank piece of paper and give 
it to him to write down what would in fact be my opinions and 
thoughts. Apparently, he had the same idea too, although I 
cannot remember the details. We really are like that, and so 
far we have not had any unresolvable differences. We sometimes 
conduct negotiations [mozakereh] and discussions [mobaheseh]. 
But we always agree with one another. I consider him at 
present to be the most suitable person for the post of 
leadership of the country, and he, too, has the same kind of 
trust in me in my present capacity. I think that some kind of 
jealousy exists about our friendship, and that is why the 
foreign media sometimes react the way they do. All this used to 
happen when he was not the leader yet, let alone now that he is 
the leader. 
  In our Constitution, the relationship between the president 
and the leader is such that disputes are totally meaningless. 
The method of work is such that a number of decisions and 
general policies are in the hands of the leader, and every one 
should obey him. On the other hand, executive affairs are with 
the president, who receives the leader's approval and blessing. 
  There is, thus, no need to worry. The future is going to be 
even better than the past. 
  [Baqir Shar'i] Some of the economic difficulties the country 
is passing through are the making of foreign hands. There are 
people who say that one of the presidential candidates had 
received a larger number of votes than expected -- is this 
something to do with the economic difficulties? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] The extent to which Iran's economic 
problems are discussed, in reality, it is not as such. Our 
facts and figures are so obvious for all that judgment is easy. 
In this five-year plan, we had an average growth of eight 
percent, which is one of the better economic growth rates in the 
world. Not many countries could have such a growth rate in five 
subsequent years. We have fully reduced the shortcomings in our 
budget. We have well strengthened our infrastructure. We have 
passed well through the readjustment period, which is a 
difficult period and normally has social consequences. The 
largest phase of it has passed. If you visit our bazaars now, 
you will see how full they are. Our products in all fields -- 
agriculture, industrial, animal husbandry, fishery, etc. -- meet 
the country's demand to a large extent. We have reduced greatly 
our need for foreign currency with our work on the 
infrastructure. And in the second plan, our need for foreign 
currency might be approximately half that of the first plan. 
You have seen how this sort of readjustment has been 
implemented in other countries, such as Russia and some others, 
and how this is being implemented in Iran. We do not have a 
problem such as the one that has been talked about. Off course 
there are shortcomings in our country, as in many other 
countries, which is quite natural and is being removed. 
Naturally, the shortcomings and the issues which are the result 
of a period of readjustment might increase or decrease the 
number of some votes. This is not a very unnatural matter. 
  We have had vote fluctuations in previous general elections 
as well. The leader of the revolution was elected for two 
terms. At that time, the number of votes cast for him in his 
second term was reduced, similar as in my second term. This is 
not an issue that we want to give it a serious thought. You can 
see that the number of votes in our country are much higher than 
in other countries that hold free elections. We won around two 
thirds of the votes in our free elections, and that is in this 
situation of transformation from the difficult policy of 
readjustment and reconstruction. 
  A president who carries out the policy of readjustment, who 
carries out the process of reconstruction after the war and the 
earthquake, as well as carrying out many infrastructure tasks at 
the cost of reducing expenditures, and still gains two-thirds of 
the people's votes in a free elections, should be considered 
very successful, in my opinion -- not with difficulties . 
  [Unidentified Lebanese correspondent, in Arabic] Your 
Eminence, do you believe that the countdown has started against 
the Islamic movement in Lebanon? This can be observed in the 
wake of the abduction of Al-Dayrani, the struggling member of 
the Believers Resistance, and also the recent massacre in 
Ba'lbak. Do you also believe that there is a regional Arabic or 
local Lebanese collusion to demonstrate that the global and 
regional powers intend to liquidate the Islamic movement in 
Lebanon and to eliminate resistance against Israel? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] There is no doubt that the power 
centers 
of the world would very much like to smash the Islamic movement 
in Lebanon. This is definitely true, even if the recent event 
had not taken place. We have no doubt that major powers of the 
world-- particularly the West--are against the Islamic movement 
in Lebanon. Of course, the recent developments were further 
indications of the past signs. 
  [HAMSHAHRI correspondent Ebrahimi] Mr. President, during 
your 
speech at the press festival, you pretended as though the 
government's behavior toward the press has been correct. 
Whereas the press has responded, to some extent, vindictively. 
In your opinion, what are the qualities of an ideal press in 
the Islamic Republic? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] We do not wish to specify what a good 
press should be. It is, however, clear from my speech at the 
press festival that we expect the press to study issues more 
deeply. It is unprofessional for the press to resort to slogans 
and demagogy to become popular. The press should help to 
clarify facts. They should approach issues analytically, 
instead of provoking blind sentiments. 
  Another point raised was that the press should understand 
the 
regime's general policies and deal with issues within that 
framework. I gave an example of the British press and their 
response vis-a-vis the recent problem with Iran. In connection 
with a question, the British press responded in a particular 
manner and alleged that an Iranian official had forged a 
document. I said that it seems the British press, as a whole, 
adopts coordination toward certain issues supported by their 
government. 
  [Ebrahimi] My next question is about the economic 
readjustment policy. Five years after the first five-year 
economic development plan, I would like to know your views on 
the positive points and the problems of adopting the economic 
readjustment policy? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] In my view, all the achievements of the 
first plan and of the economic readjustment were positive. The 
issue raised is the problem of some price rises. This was one 
of the objectives. We have to raise prices to their real level 
if we wish to achieve a healthy economy. Subsidized prices will 
never allow an economy to take shape. 
  Perhaps we can say, as a point of weakness, that some 
merchants, producers, or importers took advantage of this free 
atmosphere created by the readjustment policy to overcharge the 
people. This was bearable at the time when there were shortages 
of commodities; however, this cannot be tolerated now. We have, 
therefore, planned to stop the practice of overcharging. We, 
however, believe that it is in the country's interest to reach 
real prices. A large portion of the resources used to subsidize 
some commodities unfairly in the past is now transferred to 
reconstruction. 
  Great tasks were fulfilled in the country. Power stations, 
highways, ports, and large steel and aluminum factories were 
built. Telecommunication were expanded. A number of 
universities were set up. Deprived areas were developed. 
Irrigation projects, including sprinkler irrigation systems, 
were implemented. Dams were built, and many other large 
projects were completed. None of these would have been possible 
without the economic readjustment policy. [passage omitted] 
  [Indian correspondent (?Sukimra Golgani), WEEKLY NEWS] I 
have two questions. What is your opinion about the current 
situation in the world economy? 
  My second question concerns the countries of Southeast Asia 
and the present state of economic cooperation in that area. I 
must point out that there is very good economic cooperation in 
Southeast Asia, but in our part of the Asian continent, the 
field of economic cooperation has not developed as such. In 
view of your talks last year with the Indian prime minister 
about economic cooperation, I would like to ask what tangible 
steps have been taken and what more can be done toward this 
important task in order to enable us to expand our economic 
cooperation like the Southeast Asian countries? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] It is correct to say that cooperation 
between other Asian countries is not as good as cooperation 
between east and Southeast Asian states. We have two fronts in 
our own area. One is the ECO [Economic Cooperation 
Organization], and we have extensive plans for cooperation 
within that organization. The other front, which we must pay 
more attention to, is cooperation with countries such as India, 
Malaysia, and the Indian subcontinent countries in general. 
  Our negotiations with Mr. Rao have paved the ground for this 
process; however, one of the obstacles we face is the present 
situation in Indo-Pakistan relations. We must try to improve 
the ties between these two countries. In our negotiations, we 
also talked about the transfer of Iranian natural gas to 
Pakistan and India. This can only materialize if these two 
states enjoy cordial relations. We think that, in view of the 
potential enjoyed by India, Iran, and other countries such as 
Malaysia, we can have a very large economic unit here. Our 
progress has not been ideal, but we are satisfied with the 
agreements reached so far. [passage omitted] 
  [RESALAT correspondent] If government decisions are based 
on plans and expert advice, why are certain decisions regularly 
revised? Does that not shift resources from construction and 
manufacturing areas to bogus tasks and middlemen? 
  For example, the multitudinous decisions of the Foreign 
Exchange Committee have caused severe fluctuations in exchange 
rates so that the dollar rose by 50 tomans in one day. That 
resulted in investors becoming foreign exchange middlemen 
instead of investing their foreign currency in manufacturing and 
in their having an overnight windfall of 50 million tomans with 
a 1 million toman investment. Are the revisions of these 
decisions to continue? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] In transition from one state to 
another, 
those decisions are sometimes necessary. All those problems are 
not caused by changing decisions. There are numerous factors in 
the country today. Attempts by middlemen, false propaganda, and 
an adverse atmosphere created by certain media have had a 
combined effect. In addition, the amount of foreign currency 
bought and sold on the market cannot be compared with the total 
foreign currency that we spend in the country. For example, 2 
million dollars is not a large sum compared to 30 or 40 million 
dollars a day, which is our foreign currency expenditure in the 
country. 
  The exchange rate fluctuation is partly due to psychological 
conditions. Each of those decisions have their own reasons. 
During transition, decisions are sometimes changed; of course, 
these are not fundamental decisions. 
  [RESALAT correspondent] My next question is that, although 
you say that Iran is owed more than it owes, why have we signed 
debt rescheduling agreements with a number of countries? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] Their debts to us are not such that 
they can be substituted for our debts to them. For instance, 
Germany owes us with regard to the Bushehr nuclear power 
station, where we spent around 7 billion German marks, but the 
Germans did not finish the work. They owe us that sum plus the 
due compensation. This case has now gone to the court, which is 
to issue a verdict. Once this verdict is issued, then we can 
consider that sum as money owed to us. Or, for instance, there 
is the large investment we made at the Krupp. This, however, is 
investment and cannot be considered as a debt to us. Only if we 
sell our shares there can we accept the proceeds as payment of 
our debts. 
  Yet one more example is America's hefty debt to us. This is 
money that the Americans are in no hurry to return to us. We 
say that the Islamic Republic of Iran is owed a lot of money 
abroad. However, there are certain conditions necessary for 
receiving these payments, and these conditions have not come 
about as yet. 
  France, too, used to owe us a lot of money. Part of these 
debts have been paid to us, while as payment for the rest of it, 
we have been made a partner in a huge uranium enriching plant. 
Of course, we can sell our shares and have the money instead. 
  The answer, therefore, is that the situation is not such 
that 
Iran has no money and has lots of debts. We indeed have large 
investments, and when these are exchanged, the country's 
creditworthiness will not be marred. 
  [Italian correspondent Andre Corvatorrio, CORRIERE DELLA 
SERA] In some European countries, investigations are going on 
concerning the assassination of Iranian dissidents living 
abroad. In some cases, it has been shown that there is some 
connection between these cases and Iranian citizens and 
officials. How do you evaluate these investigations, and how 
does Iran react to them? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] What the esteemed reporter said was a 
mere claim, since the investigations thus far have not been able 
to ascertain that Iranian officials have been involved in the 
incidents. There are court cases ongoing in France and Germany 
right now. In general, however, we say that all of these 
reports are false propaganda. We do not know the causes of 
these incidents, although our guess is that these are due to 
factional infighting abroad. It really is not the policy of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran to deal with the opposition in this 
way. Despite all the efforts by those opposing us, they still 
have not been able to prove one single case. I would like to 
ask you to mention a proven case, if you know of one, so that I 
can explain here. 
  [Corvatorrio] There was a case published by TIME magazine, 
as 
well as the case of Bakhtiyar. My question is: What is Iran's 
position toward the trial of these people abroad? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] We comply with international laws. 
Where we have an extradition agreement, these people should be 
extradited to Iran. Where we do not have such an agreement, we 
have no opposition to a fair trial for these individuals. Of 
course, we expect that foreign governments should refrain from 
false propaganda and improper methods of investigations. If 
they seek to misuse their powers in the course of these trials, 
then we naturally oppose them. However, if we witness fairness, 
then we can accept the court verdict. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent Farid Hashemi] This question was also asked 
by a foreign reporter. However, another aspect is in question. 
Considering the record of many western--particularly 
American--media in distorting news and facts about Iran, I 
wanted to ask why was it necessary to invite editors of American 
newspapers to Iran? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] The Islamic Guidance Ministry 
apparently 
invited them. We think it is not a negative step; it is a 
positive action. We believe newspapers in the world have 
certain facilities at their disposal and can inform the people 
to a great extent. 
  You know that there is a great deal of false propaganda 
against Iran in America. That event was like the news 
conference that is happening now. Well, we should not think 
that every person who holds a pen in America is an agent of 
arrogance. There are free and liberal people who write the 
truth in many parts of the world. 
  So far, we have not decided to cease trading with America. 
On the whole we do not think that severance would be right. 
You are probably aware that much of our military equipment from 
the past is American. Many of our factories and much of our 
expensive machinery is American, and so forth. They require 
spare parts. They require repairs. They should be looked 
after. If you say we should throw away those great national 
assets, that would not be logically right. They cannot be 
replaced either. 
  For example, Iran Air's planes are all Boeing, which belongs 
to the Americans. Their repairs sometimes need to be carried 
out in places that are affiliated with the Americans, or at 
least it is necessary to obtain their permission. As a reporter 
are you suggesting that we should sever all that? 
  [Hashemi] Excuse me, that was not the question. 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] I am saying that trade on a wide scale 
cannot be severed if there are certain problems. It is not 
right for you to agitate feelings like this. The Americans also 
need trade with Iran. We are selling large quantities of oil to 
America. Of course, it does not go to America directly. We sell 
it elsewhere, and the Americans take it from there. Are you 
saying we should not sell that oil? 
  [Hashemi] I was speaking symbolically, about America as a 
symbol. 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] In my opinion, that symbolism is 
somewhat common, of the garden variety. 
  [ITAR-TASS correspondent Alexey Kozyrev] Mr. President, I 
have three questions related to your foreign policy. What is 
your opinion on the second round of talks to be held in Tehran 
soon between the Tajikistan Government and their opposition 
groups? 
  The next question is about the Iranian proposal two months 
ago to mediate in the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 
Does Iran intend to mediate, or is it going to remain an 
observer until others start mediating? 
  My final question is about relations between Iran and Egypt. 
Iran maintains diplomatic ties with such Islamic countries as 
Turkey and Kazakhstan, and with other countries that have 
established relations with Israel. Why should Iran maintain 
ties with those other countries--for instance, with Turkey, 
which enjoys close ties with Israel--while it has broken ties 
with Egypt? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] About the Tajikistan talks, we are 
doing our best. In our opinion the war is not in the interest 
of the people or the government of Tajikistan. A free 
environment should be created there through democracy, and 
anyone who wins elections can run the country. We are striving 
to implement this policy. 
  About Karabakh, we consider Azerbaijan to be the aggrieved 
party, and we are striving to end this conflict. Our efforts 
have not succeeded thus far, but we have not given up in 
despondency. We are prepared to mediate whenever we feel that 
the war can be terminated. We believe it will be in both 
Armenia's and Azerbaijan's interests, as well as in the interest 
of the Karabakh people, to end this war and to resolve the 
dispute through political means. We once became very active, 
but it became clear that the ground was not ripe yet. We 
currently plan to prepare the ground to help again. 
  About Egypt, our significant dispute with Egypt began after 
Camp David. We believe the Camp David accords led to a division 
between the Arabs and other Muslims. Israel exploited this 
issue immensely, and the Muslims and Arabs lost heavily. The 
Palestinians incurred massive losses. We severed our ties with 
Egypt for this reason. They have not abandoned the path that 
they adopted during Sadat's presidency. This is why our 
relations with Egypt are cool; otherwise, we regard Egypt as a 
great Islamic country, and we would like to work with them when 
circumstances permit. We hope they will pay attention to our 
remarks. 
  [JOMHURI-E ESLAMI correspondent Pur-Eskandar] In the name 
of God, the merciful, the compassionate. We have heard that in 
the process of merging the three ministries involved with 
industries, there is talk of selling to the private sector the 
steel and other nationalized industries, as well as the 
organization for promotion of industries. You have stressed 
during the course of this conference that all these processes 
will take place in accordance with the Constitution. My 
question, however, is whether or not it will be the case that 
the ministries concerned will be weakened as a result of the 
sale of important industries to the private sector? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] Of course, this merger has been put 
forward by the Majles and not by the government. What the 
Majles has voted for is the merger of the two Ministries of 
Industries and of Heavy Industries. Some people talk of the 
merger of the third ministry, but we hope that this does not 
take place. 
  As far as the sale of the steel and other mother industries 
are concerned, we do not agree with such a move, and we have no 
plan to do such a thing. Apparently, the Majles will not take 
this step either. It seems that a proposal had been put forward 
in a certain Majles committee. 
  [Pur-Eskandar] [passage indistinct] 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] Well, this has merely to do with 
individuals, and one should not attribute it to the Majles or to 
the government. 
  [Pur-Eskandar] But the collection of these individuals may 
begin a process.... 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani, interrupting] This will probably be 
contrary to the Constitution. If it proves to be so, then the 
Guardian Council will reject it. This is supposing that such a 
move receives the approval of the Majles, an approval that I 
consider to be very remote. The Majles, of course, is free and 
independent, and the deputies have a free vote. If they vote in 
favor of such a move--and if the Guardian Council does not 
reject the bill--then this will become a law and will have to be 
implemented. However, I do not think that such an outcome is 
likely. 
  [Pur-Eskandar] My second question concerns the recent 
remarks 
by the leader of the revolution, when he stated that we should 
not expect any help from the Satanic powers and should instead 
implement divine punishments [hodud]--even though the Satanic 
powers accuse us of violating human rights. As the head of the 
executive power, what means would you deploy to confront the 
plots of global arrogance? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] Sometimes the issue has to do with 
propaganda. In this case, it is clear that they have more 
propaganda means at their disposal than we do. We should also 
convey our ideas to the world as much as possible. Compared 
with them, we really have much more to say about these issues 
since the real violation of human rights, in its real sense, is 
being carried out every day by those who point an accusing 
finger at us. 
  The events in Bosnia-Herzegovina today are a test case that 
can reveal their intentions. Alternatively, one can look at the 
incidents in Palestine and Lebanon during recent days. The 
Americans are even preventing the UN Security Council from 
giving a hearing to Lebanon's complaint. Why should it be that 
a government that has the right of veto in the Security Council 
chooses to prevent the complaint of an independent government to 
be put forward? It is therefore quite clear that they are not 
honest. 
  If the issue has to do with propaganda, then you media 
people 
should perform your duties. However, if we are talking about 
what is actually taking place in reality, then we claim that the 
Islamic Republic of Iran observes human rights more strictly 
than any other country within the framework of Islamic tenets 
and our Constitution. We are prepared to state and argue this 
anywhere in the world. 
  [Pur-Eskandar] I thank you for your reply to the people and 
to the readers of JOMHURI-E ESLAMI. 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] Thank you. 
  [INDEPENDENT correspondent Charles Richards] I have two 
questions. Does the Islamic Republic of Iran share the aims of 
the Marxist IRA and seek the creation of a united Ireland? The 
second question: Is Mr. Arat, the Israeli pilot, in Iran? 
Whether he is in Iran or not, what is Iran prepared to do to 
help secure his release? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] Both issues, in our view, are part of 
the fabricated propaganda against the Islamic Republic. About 
the IRA, we have said before and have denied that there is a 
connection between it and the Islamic Republic authorities. It 
is a matter concerning Britain and the Irish. I think, due to 
their weakness in protecting themselves in Britain, they needed 
to say that their opposition is receiving help from abroad--to 
justify their weakness somehow. There was absolutely no truth 
in it. 
  About the Israeli pilot, we think probably they have raised 
the issue as a preemptive measure because the Israelis are 
accused of the kidnapping of Iranians in Lebanon some years ago. 
Whenever anybody has said this to us, we have told them to 
bring any document or evidence that states that any part of this 
matter is connected to Iran, and we would start our 
investigation from that point. They have not given us any 
evidence yet. Everyday they go to a government that is friendly 
with us and raise the issue to cover up the issue of the four 
Iranians who were innocently abducted in Lebanon and 
disappeared. No reporter ever comes here to ask who is 
responsible, who should answer. 
  Here is a pilot who has gone and bombed a place, and his 
plane has crashed. Whatever his fate--and we see that they ask 
about him--no one asks about our missing persons. I do not know 
why the feelings of you westerners are one-sided. What was the 
next question? 
  [Richards] Do you deny that the Israeli pilot is in this 
country? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] Certainly. He is not here. It is a 
fabrication by the Israelis, as I said, to cover up the fate of 
the four Iranians. You ask the Israelis about the fate of the 
four missing Iranians. 
  [ABRAR correspondent Khalili] Mr. President, there have been 
questions regarding the British issue, but they have not been 
answered. The anti-Iranian propaganda in the West--and 
particularly in Britain, with accusations of terrorism--are 
intended to put the Islamic Republic on the defensive. Here, 
however, we see no serious attempt by the government. It seems 
that the new wave of accusations is an attempt to prepare the 
grounds for greater pressure at the Naples meeting to compensate 
for the failure of the Tokyo meeting. Britain failed to secure 
European cooperation in pressuring Iran at that meeting. 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] I do not refute your statement that our 
propaganda is not as strong as theirs. 
  [Khalili] My reference is to government action. I think the 
government has no serious action here. 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] They have made accusations, and our 
response is the same. When there are active measures, our 
reaction will also be active measures. What, in your opinion, 
could be an active measure against such propaganda? 
  [Khalili] Well, London has recently violated diplomatic and 
conventional norms, including the placing of a microphone at the 
Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran. In such cases, the 
westerners themselves sometimes go as far as severing relations. 
Has the government thought about this? This is my question. 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] We do not see the need to take the 
initiative in severing relations. Relations were severed once. 
Both countries understood that they have certain cooperation. 
They need us for some things; we need them for others. Well, 
things come together in many places. Severing of relations will 
not change anything. In principle, we do not particularly 
benefit from a policy of severing relations, except in 
particular cases and for exceptional reasons--as in the case of 
Egypt. 
  I think the existing weak relations must exist for ordinary 
dialogue. We have many students in Britain. If we bring them 
all back it would cause damage. If they want to stay, someone 
has to look after their affairs. There are many Iranians there. 
There are, naturally, ordinary economic relations and the like. 
We have to see our interest in its totality. Yes, of course, 
we have to reciprocate their actions in kind. Your view is that 
there should be an offensive policy instead of a defensive one 
at times. 
  [Khalili] A policy of reciprocation in kind, as you said. 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] There is reciprocation in kind. At no 
place have we abandoned reciprocation in kind. Even in some 
places, as they say in war, offense is the best defense. That 
is correct. In political affairs too, we must go on the 
offensive at times. 
  [Khalili] My second question is regarding the policy of 
economic adjustment. Does the government have a policy of 
supporting the salaried classes, beside maintaining some of the 
subsidies? Your excellency recently said that management of 
life for those on a fixed income has become somewhat difficult. 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] This is indeed the case. I accept that 
wages should rise according to price increases. We raised wages 
at one stage. This year they will naturally increase according 
to employment laws. We should plan to compensate for the wages, 
however, if there is a backlog. We have done so with the 
workers. 
  [Khalili] It has not been implemented for government 
employees. 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] It has been done for workers. We have 
added the 22 percent inflation to wages. I think we should do 
something for the employees, and we are preparing this. 
  [AFP correspondent Millot, in English] Mr. President I have 
two questions. The United States have become again the first 
trade partner of Iran. How long do you think Iran will be able 
to delay political normalization of its links? 
  [Millot] The second question is: Foreign minister, Dr. 
Velayati is to go to Baghdad soon. How do you see the prospects 
of this trip and what is the main condition for an improvement 
in relations? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] Regarding America where the reporter 
said we are economic partners: I have said that we never 
stopped our economic relations with America. We have weakened 
them. We won't buy from America if we find goods from other 
places. We give priority to the non-American goods. America 
does the same with us. Regarding political relations: We really 
don't trust America to have good intentions. It opposed our 
movement and bothered us prior to the revolution. Since the 
revolution, it has always been the enemy of the revolution. You 
continue to see the examples which we can present. They claim 
to have an interest in talks to resolve the issues. But since 
we don't see good intentions in America, we don't think it wise 
to start negotiations. Because probably there are wrong 
intentions in these proposals. We have told them: If you have 
good intentions you should actually prove this in at least one 
case, for instance with our claims, we said. For the past 15-16 
years, we have had large amounts of money and valuable goods 
blocked in America. There are no conditions. The money is in a 
certain account there. America can, as a sign of good faith 
release our money. This would be a sign of good faith if they 
are serious. When the issue of hostages in Lebanon came up, the 
mediators... [pauses] the UN general secretary who was a 
mediator told us that if we helped with the release of Western 
hostages in Lebanon the U.S. reaction would be to release your 
assets. Well we did. We helped and the Western hostages, 
including the Americans in Lebanon, were freed. But we 
witnessed that the Americans failed to carry out the promise of 
the UN general secretary, the most senior figure who had made 
promises to us. Is this not an indication of enmity? This is 
sufficient reason for us to mistrust them. From our point of 
view, the Americans should first of all actually prove their 
good intentions. We are yet to see this. [passage omitted] 
  The visit by Dr. Velayati to Iraq is aimed at improvement of 
ties. Certain provisions of the resolution, which we have both 
agreed on have not yet been implemented. We still have problems 
to do with the issue of PoWs, the existing mines planted on the 
borders, the dredging of the Arvand River [Shatt al-'Arab], and 
a number of other issues. He is going to negotiate, and if the 
suitable ground is prepared and all solutions are acceptable to 
both sides, then we can hope for progress. 
  [TEHRAN TIMES correspondent Sajjadi] My question concerns 
the 
future prospects for Iran-Syria ties. In view of the fact that 
one of our original incentives to expand our ties with Syria was 
that country's position in the front line of struggle against 
the Zionist regime, and considering the current round of 
negotiations between Syria and the Zionist regime about the 
issue of the Golan Heights, what is the future prospect for our 
ties with the Syrian Government, should the said negotiations 
produce an agreement? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] We have a lot of trust in the Syrian 
Government, and we are not worried that the Syrians may 
sacrifice their interests or the interests of the Palestinians. 
For this reason, we are optimistic about our ties with Syria. 
Hafiz al-Asad is a strong and powerful man, with a great sense 
of responsibility. 
  [Sajjadi] My next question concerns the internal strife in 
Afghanistan. It is said that the United Nations has a new plan 
about bringing Najibollah back to power and topple the forces 
currently on the scene in that country. What is the position of 
the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran toward this plan, 
and in general toward the internal strife in Afghanistan? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] These are rumors. I consider it as very 
remote that the United Nations should think that it is possible 
to bring back someone whom the people have overthrown with Jihad 
and armed struggle, especially as the people are still in 
possession of weapons. Of course, the Afghan forces are not in 
harmony with one another. But although they argue and bicker, 
they would still resist against such a move. 
  [Sajjadi] Does the Islamic Republic of Iran have any plan to 
lend more effective support to the Afghan situation? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] Right now we have a delegation in 
Afghanistan trying to resolve the ongoing disputes. However, 
the task ahead is very arduous. 
  [Unidentified ANATOLIA correspondent, in English] Mr. 
President, I come from a Muslim country. I have lived in Iran 
for the past two years. In my country, the same as other 
countries, there are some problems. I have heard that it is 
said in Iran that Islam and its instructions are the only 
solution to all problems. But during the past two years of 
living in Iran, I have seen that Iran is suffering from the same 
problems that exist in other countries. The examples are: A 
very high inflation rate, foreign debt, and the fact that Iran's 
income ranks it somewhere between the rich and poor countries. 
Faced with all these, can we say that Islamic instructions are 
the best solution to Islamic countries' problems? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] When we say we are Muslims, it does not 
mean all our problems will be solved. We think we can solve our 
problems within Islam's framework, but it takes time. We must 
solve our problems gradually. As you can see in Iran today, 
conditions are better than the neighboring countries that are 
not committed to Islam. We still do not believe that Islam has 
been fully implemented in Iran. We must implement it gradually. 
The series of problems you mentioned, including the economic 
difficulties, can be solved in the long-term by relying upon 
foundations of the Islamic instructions. [passage omitted] 
  [SALAM correspondent Nuri-Shemirani] Mr. President, the 
price 
of goods -- according to policies for regulating the economy -- 
are set on the basis of supply and demand and the performance of 
the market. Do not the new pricing policies mean a diversion 
from the past policies and do they not confuse producers? Also 
do they not create problems for the production security and 
economic security that you had in mind? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] I believe not. You see regulation does 
not mean that we do not set prices. If you refer to your own 
archives, you would be able to find out that during the first 
years that we opened up to trade we mentioned, at that time, 
that when there is a shortage of goods then price controls will 
cause everything to go underground and will create hoarding such 
as the black market and multiple prices. But under the 
conditions when goods are in the market in a normal way then it 
is the time for setting prices. Even if you go to the countries 
whose economies are the most free in the world you still see 
price controls. When you go to any store, in any country, you 
can see that there are price tags on their goods. We do not 
intend to impose unrealistic prices on goods. There are a 
series of goods that are monopoly goods. We set the price of 
those monopoly goods, which are chiefly controlled by the 
government and we have no problem with them. For example, lump 
sugar, sugar, tea, steel and so on. [passage omitted] 
  We believe that this does not contradict our regulating 
policies. Perhaps from the point of view that we do not allow 
any overcharging to take place, the customer being misled and 
unknowingly buying some product for many times its price, that 
will stop such things taking place. 
  [Nuri-Shemirani] My second question is, up to a point, 
similar to that of previous questions asked by other friends. 
The implementation of regulating policies has had some negative 
effects on the low-income strata of society during the past few 
years. Do you not think that such effects have caused some 
problems for the success of the regulating policies, even if we 
say, for argument's sake, that the regulating policy is correct? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] Our plan was to increase wages for the 
wage earners even somewhat more than inflation. Those working 
for themselves will naturally set their own tariffs accordingly. 
For example, like the newspapers, who themselves increase their 
prices or increase charges for their advertisements. There are 
also some who earn no wages and have no income. Every year's 
budget has allocated a great deal of money, through the [Imam's] 
Relief Committee and other foundations, for them. We have also 
helped them a great deal. That is the policy and the plan is a 
comprehensive one, but you may even know of some cases that have 
not benefited from that; general policy has considered all the 
cases, but still there may be cases that we have not seen. 
  [British correspondent Podlin from Channel Four Television, 
in English] Mr. President, part of my question was answered by 
somebody else, but I will repeat it. 
  After 15 years, the model of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
has 
had no imitators and very few close friends, even in the Muslim 
world. 
  [Interpreter] He is from the British Channel Four. It is 15 
years now that the Islamic Republic of Iran has been created as 
a model of an Islamic state. During that time very few 
countries have emulated Iran, and Iran has few friends in the 
world. Many of the Western states are still regarding Iran with 
animosity and great fear. Do you feel that Iran will eventually 
have to distinguish between the practical economic and social 
needs of the country, and what are the sum total of the 
ideologies of the country? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] We really do not see any need for such 
a 
change of method. We do not think that just because the Islamic 
revolution has been realized our ideology is in conflict with 
our needs. What did occur was that because of the revolution 
the interests of some developed countries of the world were 
threatened or that of some of the non-populist powers [qheyr-e 
mardomi] were threatened. They stood against us. They either 
make false propaganda against Iran; or they imposed the war 
against us; or they create economic problems through economic 
blockades and sanctions, etc. [sentence as heard] Those things 
have no correlation with Iran's ideology in that form, they are 
mostly related to Iran's independence-seeking policy. If, 
within the framework of Islam we were ready to pay the 
foreigners the same ransom that the Pahlavi regime used to pay 
in the past then may be these things would not have come about. 
There really does not seem to be any need for a change in 
ideology. The problems that you referred to were predictable 
for us and we are eliminating them gradually. 
  [Podlin] Thank you. 
  [Correspondent Fazel from KAR VA KARGAR] Your Excellency, 
you 
have always placed emphasis on expanding the social welfare 
system, alongside the implementation of economic regulation 
policies. However, it is witnessed that the Social Welfare 
Organization has cancelled a number of its undertakings to the 
wage-earning strata; such as the receipt of franchise from 
workers at present or omitting a number of medical drugs from 
their list of medical assistance. I would be grateful for some 
explanation. 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] Of course, the Social Welfare 
Organization has increased its payments significantly during the 
recent years. If you refer to the data available at the Labor 
Ministry, you will see that the said organization has sharply 
increased its payments. However, if it has reduced payments in 
specific areas, these reductions have been matched by increased 
payments to those receiving benefits and income supplements. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Fazel] I have one more question in connection with your 
support for the sale of factory shares to the workers. It has 
been witnessed that the National Industries Organization has 
been selling the shares of a number of factories it controls to 
real or corporate entities. I would be grateful if you would 
explain. 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] We have a bill in this connection, 
which 
has been approved by the cabinet. According to this bill, the 
employees receive priority in being granted 33 percent of the 
factory shares. There is however a deadline involved, and if 
the employees do not come forward within this set deadline, then 
the shares can be sold to other applicants. If an arrangement 
different to this has been seen at any place, then the case must 
receive due attention. 
  [Fazel] Thank you. 
  [DALLAS MORNING NEWS correspondent, name indistinct, in 
English] The first question is that the government of Husni 
Mubarak in Egypt continues to charge Iran with financing Islamic 
militants... [correspondent's voice fades to interpreter] 
  [Interpreter] She is from the DALLAS MORNING NEWS. She has 
two questions. The Husni Mubarak administration still believes 
that Iran is responsible for the unrest by Islamists in that 
country. Could you make a statement on that? [passage omitted] 
  Second question: What are the results of the efforts that 
are being made by the supporters of Islam in Egypt and Algeria 
for overthrowing the governments of those countries? How much 
do you think the Iranian revolution has affected those countries? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] As for our intervention in the internal 
affairs of Egypt, to be fair, it is not true. We have 
repeatedly asked for one instance of that to be given to us. 
Not one instance has been given. Some of the Egyptian media 
themselves have expressly said that we have no proof so far for 
the claims made by some of the Egyptian authorities. The same 
applies to Algeria. 
  As to our view: Our view is that people's opinion must be 
respected. You yourself -- whether in America, Britain, or 
wherever -- have the same claim. You yourselves seriously raise 
the issue of democracy, at least for others, or for yourselves, 
even if you do not support it. Well, when close to 70 percent 
of the people in Algeria voted for a group why should their vote 
be null and void. None of those who claim support for democracy 
has given an answer to that question -- those same people who 
support the Algerian Government. In our view the correct course 
is to respect people's opinion. If they do not have elections 
they should officially say that it is a dictatorship. But those 
who hold elections, well, they should respect the people's vote. 
We seek the second alternative -- that elections should be held 
and the vote should be respected. Then if those who come to 
power were unable to perform or perform badly then the people 
will not vote for them in the next session. That is our view. 
  [Correspondent, name indistinct, in English] Could you 
please answer the question to what extent the Islamic revolution 
here has had on Islamic movements in Algeria and Egypt. 
  [Interpreter] Could you please respond to this part of my 
question: To what extent has the Islamic revolution in Iran 
influenced the operations that go on in Egypt and Algeria. 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] I cannot truly specify Iran's influence 
now. It definitely has had some effect. Anyway, a revolution 
was easily successful in Iran; and in war showed valor; made the 
world notice; it is building its' country by itself and making 
it independent. Those things are inspirational for many. Of 
course, in Arab states there have been liberation-seeking ideas 
before Iran's revolution. You certainly know that in Egypt 
there were Islamic movements before us. When we ourselves were 
struggling we took inspiration from the Egyptians to a certain 
extent, from the era of their struggles. In Algeria the people 
embarked on jihad before us and liberated their country. 
Algeria was a progressive country. It is not so that they 
should now come and merely emulate us. Our path assists them 
also. The fact that an Islamic government was established and 
succeeded in going through so many conspiracies is definitely 
inspirational for other nations. Nations are not uninformed 
after all; they become informed these days. The people in the 
world understand many things nowadays that they did not 
understand before. 
  [Correspondent Qotbi of KEYHAN HAVA'I'] Mr. President, my 
colleague from HAMSHAHRI asked a question. I would like further 
explanation. While senior government managers and experts 
refrain from giving interviews to the press, how could the press 
be expected to give all-round coverage of the country's 
policies? If you wish I could give you examples. 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] If it is as you say and the officials 
refrain from explaining, you are right in saying that you have 
difficulty in reporting facts. But I do not think it is so, 
because our ministers -- each about their own sector -- are 
ready to answer any questions and give any explanations you 
want. You should ask specifically and we will tell them to 
answer any questions you have. It is not our policy to leave any 
question unanswered. 
  [Qotbi] My second question is about the UAE [United Arab 
Emirates]. If we assume that the UAE, backed by super powers 
that support the UAE's claim, is able to somehow substantiate 
and legitimize that claim, what would Iran do? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] The UAE could, under no circumstances, 
substantiate that claim, which would be acceptable by 
international centers, because we have very strong documents. 
The UAE is not even prepared to talk. We say, come and talk, 
but they place preconditions. 
  [Qotbi] I mean if they go to the Security Council and, 
backed 
by the superpowers, substantiate their claims. 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] They would not achieve anything. I said 
at the Friday prayers once that if anyone except Iran intends to 
lay a hand on those islands there would be a bloodbath. Iran 
would under no circumstances forego that right, whoever is 
behind it. In our view, to whichever court it is taken, if 
justice prevails, the UAE would be convicted. [passage omitted] 
  [AL-'ALAM correspondent al-Dahrani, in Arabic] Your 
Excellency, President Hashemi-Rafsanjani, what is your stance 
regarding the recent events in Yemen, especially as there have 
been important developments in the civil war in that country, 
such as the involvement of the Security Council last week, the 
GCC's recognition of the separation of the South, and the 
massing by Saudi Arabia of troops on the border with Yemen? 
Another question: What is the truth about the accusations made 
a couple of days ago by the southern leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid 
about Iran standing on the side of North Yemen? I have another 
question after these. 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani, in Arabic] On the actual question of 
Yemen, we ourselves believe that Yemen should remain united. We 
are against Yemen's disintegration; but if the people of Yemen 
decide otherwise then Iran will take no action. But our view is 
that it is not in the interests of Yemen that it be 
disintegrated. On the allegations that we have supported one of 
the sides, that is totally false. We declared that we are 
against the civil war in Yemen and will not help either of the 
sides. That is usually so in all cases, let alone in the case 
of Yemen, which is a Muslim state and for which we have 
affection. We are not even prepared to help one of the sides of 
the civil war in a faraway country. 
  [Al-Dahrani, in Arabic] The second question, Mr. President, 
is if the criteria for your relations with the Arab countries 
depend on the nature of their relations with the Zionist entity, 
how will the Iranian Government deal with these countries, that 
is, the Arab countries, if they normalize relations with Tel 
Aviv, given that there have been several steps in this regard at 
the commercial and political levels? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] Of course if they do such a thing it 
would affect our relations. Our relations will become somewhat 
weaker; but that does not mean the severance of relations. The 
reason we severed our relations with Egypt was because Egypt 
took the first step toward the Camp David agreement and the 
breaking of the Muslims' line of defense. That was a special 
move. If others also join them, we shall not cut our relations 
with all of them. Currently we have relations with many 
countries who deal with Israel. But friendship and sincerity 
would be damaged. 
  [Al-Dahrani, in Arabic] My last question is a brief one; it 
is about yourself. What do you intend to do once your second 
term as president ends? Are you thinking of taking a different 
job, or are you thinking of taking another political job? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] For 40 years, since I began the 
struggle, I have devoted myself to the revolution and to our 
country. At any time or in any situation, I shall do whatever I 
think useful for the people, and I am not particular about what 
that work is. 
  [REUTER correspondent Yusef Azmeh, in English with 
superimposed Persian translation] In the foreign currency 
sector, there have been allocations of foreign currency, import 
restrictions, and changes in economic policies. Also, reforms 
are being undertaken. I would like to know what the power of 
the state is in carrying out those tasks. It seems that the 
state has not shown much power in carrying out those tasks. 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] In what? 
  [Azmeh] In determining the foreign currency rate of 
exchange, 
import restrictions, and on the whole, the carrying out of 
economic reforms. I would like to know how much power the 
government can exert in this regard. 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] I think that we have full power to 
adjust the markets. Our program in the first Five-Year 
Development Plan was to spend a great deal of foreign currency 
during the first three or four years for delayed work and 
infrastructure. It is in the second plan that the foreign 
currency commitments of the first plan will gradually be paid. 
The same thing has happened again. We are under the present 
price conditions getting $12 to $13 billion annually in hard 
currency for oil, and we have around $5 billion worth of nonoil 
exports. Our foreign currency requirements, according to our 
accurate calculations, are much less than they were during the 
first plan because now we produce many of the raw materials, and 
our big tasks, such as setting up power stations, refineries, 
and petrochemical units, have now been carried out. We will 
certainly have adjustments in the market. We think that the 
Central Bank is capable of managing a policy for the foreign 
currency prices in rials to stay at a particular point that we 
consider appropriate. 
  Our foreign debts have been well scheduled. We have a debt 
of about $17 billion which has been scheduled from now until the 
year 2000. We will be repaying some $2.5 to $3 billion of our 
debts annually. The rest of the foreign currency will be in our 
own hands for our day-to-day requirements. 
  [Azmeh] Can I go back a moment? One of the criticisms that 
we 
hear all the time from people in Iran is that because you've 
been changing policies, you decided you're going to abolish 
different exchange rates. Now you've come back to them. You 
wanted to get rid of subsidies, now you've slowed down getting 
rid of subsidies. It's creating a lot of uncertainty in the 
market and a lot of uncertainty in the economy. 
  [Interpreter] One of the criticisms levelled against Iran 
that we hear is that the policies change -- for example, 
regarding subsidies or other matters -- and that creates 
uncertainty regarding Iran's market. What is your view about 
those changes of policy? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] Give us instances. When we announced an 
adjustment, we announced a gradual adjustment. We have repeated 
many times that in the course of 10 years we will gradually 
carry out the adjustment. In the past five years, about 60 to 
70 percent of the adjustment has been carried out, in, for 
example, bread and fuel, energy on the whole, and some 
pharmaceuticals. Some things remain which will be dealt with in 
the next five years. No change has been implemented in our 
economic policy in principle. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] There is talk of a creeping 
political movement aimed at weakening you and competing with 
you. On the other hand there are rumors about the leader 
rejecting your resignation. What political movement is it? Is 
it not one that seeks to slow down the country's economic 
reforms? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] I think those rumors are being spread 
in 
the country by counterrevolutionaries. We do not have a 
creeping movement seeking to weaken the government. We really 
do not have any organized movement. It has never occurred to me 
to resign, for anybody to reject my resignation. As I said, 
since I started my political activities 40 years ago, I decided 
to serve this system for the rest of my life. I will work 
wherever I can serve better, and at present, I can serve best as 
president. I think there is no better place for me to serve at 
present. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] A Majles deputy talked about 
it. 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] I have not heard it. Who was it? It is 
definitely a lie. If he has said it somewhere, it is definitely 
not true, because there has been no such rumor and it would not 
even occur to me. 
  [Italian news agency correspondent Parhan] Mr. President, 
for 
some time now you have stretched the hand of unity toward 
Islamic countries, but there is no prospect of agreement between 
you and them. Do you not believe that in addition to political 
differences, there may be religious differences that prevent 
that agreement? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] Do you mean sectarian differences? 
  [Parhan] Shiite-Sunni differences. 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] I think it unlikely that there are 
Shiite- Sunni differences between Islamic countries at the 
government level. For our part, we do not have any. I think 
those gentlemen's problems are mostly political and concern 
their connection with large countries, such as America and 
Britain, and so forth, in large issues. [passage omitted] 
  [Interpreter] As a result of the Armenian aggression 
against Azerbaijan, more than 1 million people have been made 
homeless. In these hard times, our people thank you for your 
fraternal assistance. 
  This is my question. A period of six months was envisaged 
for giving assistance to the homeless people of Azerbaijan. 
That period will soon expire. Does the Islamic Republic of 
Iran intend to continue its assistance to the Azeri people at 
the end of that period? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] Yes, we intend to continue the 
assistance as long as you need our help and we have resources. 
Right now you are in need and we are able to assist, to 
continue. [addresses audience] Well, if you have any questions, 
ask them. 
  [Unidentified member of the audience] Several questions 
remain. 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] Well, since I am still sitting here, 
you might as well tell me. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] During the imposed war, the 
agriculture sector showed the least vulnerability. That sector, 
according to experts, has enjoyed good growth. Taking into 
consideration economic, political, and demographic developments 
worldwide, where foodstuffs embody the pressure levers and 
strategic points, what plans have you envisaged for the 
development of the agriculture sector and the improvement of the 
situation of agricultural producers? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] We envisage acceptable figures for the 
second plan for controlling waters, for constructing canals, for 
setting up drip or spray irrigation, for mechanizing and 
incorporating lands, for supporting agricultural intermediary 
industries, for supporting farmers and the guaranteed purchase 
of farmers' products, and much more. We hope in the second plan 
to become totally self-sufficient in economic products and in 
some cases to be exporting. 
  [KYODO correspondent Yasushi Konji, in English] Mr. 
President, I would like to ask about the relationship between 
Iran and North Korea. The countries around North Korea, 
including Japan, now understand that that country, North Korea, 
is developing a nuclear weapon. Some reports say that North 
Korea also provides nuclear technology and ground-to-ground 
missiles to Iran. Other reports say these two countries are 
cooperating in the development of these weapons. What are your 
views on this issue? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] That information is not correct. 
First, we do not intend to seek nuclear weapons. You know that 
the International Atomic Energy Agency visits Iran regularly and 
all our installations are under their inspection. They have 
repeatedly confirmed that Iran is planning peaceful utilization, 
not a military application, of nuclear technology. Second, 
about North Korea, we do not know at all whether they have 
nuclear capabilities or not. Even if they have, we are not 
interested in receiving such technology from anybody, no matter 
who. 
  [Konji] Mr. President, the international community regards 
North Korea's plan to develop nuclear weapons as a threat to 
peace. What is your position on this? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] We are not in favor of nuclear weapons 
proliferation. Of course, alongside this, we seriously believe 
that others must be disarmed too. No one should possess nuclear 
weapons. Those who think they should possess these weapons and 
others should not, they are wrong. This way of thinking is 
dangerous for the world. Those who are threatened by nuclear 
weapons would think of matching the threat, and this leads to 
proliferation. We must all cooperate, particularly the 
Japanese, who were victims of a nuclear catastrophe. They 
should help more to eliminate nuclear weapons in the world. 
  [Spanish news agency correspondent Beatrice Salas, in 
English] Mr. President, after 15 years of the revolution the 
system of the Islamic Republic of Iran is stable and as you say 
you have two thirds of the support of your people. When will it 
be the time for the others to express their opinion in political 
parties, not Islamic, please? 
  [Interpreter] Fifteen years after the Islamic revolution the 
system of the Islamic Republic of Iran is stable. What will 
you do to convey the views of the Islamic Republic of Iran to 
other countries? [passage omitted] In order to convey and 
spread Iranian views in other countries? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] To the extent that we have the ability 
to propagate our thoughts -- through our radio, through our 
media, through our meetings, through seminars, and through 
taking part in international organizations -- we express our 
views. 
  [Salas] Another light question please. I come from a very 
happy country and I can say that colors is very important for 
the spirit. Can we have ladies the permission of your 
excellency to wear Islamic dresses? For example, your regional 
dresses are full of color and Islamic and not these black 
chadors. 
  [Interpreter] She asks if it is possible for ladies to make 
use of different colors in their dress, instead of the black 
chador as hejab [Islamic dress]. 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] Of course it is possible. The color 
black has not been chosen as an Islamic color. In Shiite 
history, in Islamic history the color black was used by 
Bani-'Abbas [the Abbasid caliphate] as their distinctive sign. 
We, the Shiites, had different colors. Our women are also free 
to choose any color they wish. They decide what they wish to 
wear, the same as you, who are wearing a black coat now. 
  [Salas] Can they wear their regional dresses? 
  [Interpreter] Could it also be done with their regional 
dresses? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] It can be done everywhere. We have not 
chosen any color as the desired Islamic colour. In my remarks I 
have told the ladies that they can choose. However, in our 
society at the moment, black is regarded as a dignified and 
formal colour. Therefore, most people use it, and we have no 
opposition to this color. 
  [Salas] Thank you very much. 
  [NHK correspondent Re'isi, in Persian] Greetings. I have two 
questions. First, the course of the Middle East talks has to 
some extent been reactivated. Mr. 'Arafat has compared the 
recent PLO agreements with Israel with the Hudaibiyyah peace 
agreement [between Prophet Muhammad and some of his enemies in 
Mecca]. What are your views on this? Is Iran against the 
establishment of a Palestinian government led by the PLO or not? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] We do not regard what is taking place 
as 
real peace. We believe it is onesided. In this way the right 
of the Palestinian people is being wasted. If a correct course 
is accepted... [pauses] Of course, these issues need to be 
discussed. For instance, if they accept that all the Palestinian 
refugees can return to Palestine and if there are free elections 
there -- the same as took place in South Africa -- then one can 
say that there is real goodwill toward peace. However, the way 
that they keep 4 or 5 million, 4 million Palestinians as 
refugees outside Palestine, and only raise the issue of autonomy 
in a small corner of Palestine, in return for which all the 
correct stances that which had been adopted by the Islamic and 
Arab world are given up, and everyone is forced to accept a 
compromise [sazesh] -- we believe that this path will not lead 
to a correct outcome. We have also announced our views. 
However, as regards practical interference, executive action, or 
the physical prevention of developments -- as far as these are 
concerned, we have not done so and we will not do so; but our 
view is what we have repeatedly expressed. 
  Now, as to who should be in charge if a government were 
formed in Palestine, that is a matter for the Palestinian 
people. Whoever is chosen by the Palestinian people is what 
they have desired. At the moment, we do not know who they will 
elect if a small Palestinain government is formed. 
  [Qatar AL-RAYAH correspondent al-Azab al-Tayyib al-Tahir, 
in Arabic] Peace be upon you, Mr. President. Mr. President, 
are there any Omani efforts to overcome the current tensions 
between Iran and Saudi Arabia? The other question is: There are 
currently certain ideas over the setting up of a Middle Eastern 
common market. What is Iran's position regarding this market, 
particularly in view of the fact that Iran is regarded as a 
would-be member country? Thank you, Mr. President. 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] Regarding Saudi Arabia, we continue to 
take the initiative and we try to solve our problems with the 
[Saudi] Arabian Government and to have sincere Islamic and 
neighborly relations. Although we have certain complaints from 
them, nevertheless, in view of the importance of the issue we 
are trying to solve our problems. 
  Concerning the common market among Islamic countries, we are 
among those who proposed it. Of course, it requires certain 
political and economic groundwork, prerequisites, and 
conditions. It is not a very urgent matter. We spread the idea 
and at a good and appropriate time, God willing, it will be 
implemented. 
  [KEYHAN correspondent Habibzadeh] Peace be upon you. Your 
Excellency, Mr. Rafsanjani, unfortunately, the issue of the 
three Persian Gulf islands has been turned into a complex 
question. It seems that this matter has been excessively 
prolonged and others are misusing the issue. Has the Islamic 
Republic of Iran any plans for settling this matter? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] The issue of the islands? 
  [Habibzadeh] Yes. 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] Our proposal was... [pauses] We invited 
the UAE foreign minister to come here for discussions, returning 
the visit of Mr. Velayati, who went there. We believe that 
bilateral talks are the solution to the problem. This is our 
plan. 
  [Correspondent, name indistinct] Mr. President, can you say 
that you and your government have no opposition to you inside 
the country? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] We have opposition. Why should we 
claim otherwise? We have counterrevolutionaries, both inside 
and outside the country. There are also some who are not 
counterrevolutionaries but who do not accept government policies 
and oppose them. They are active too. Look at all the 
magazines and publications in Iran and see how much opposition 
there is. 
  [Correspondent] What is the policy of the Government of Iran 
on Kashmiri Muslims? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] On Kashmiris, our initial view was that 
UN resolutions should be implemented, that India and Pakistan 
should cooperate, and that, in accordance with UN resolutions, 
the rights of the people of Kashmir should be realized. 
  [Muhammad Mahdi from Lebanon] Peace be upon you. Your 
Excellency, Mr. President, in the Middle East region talks and 
negotiations are under way between Arab governments and Israel 
on ways of solving what is known as the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
How do you see this settlement in general, and do you think 
that there are any other ways apart from military means to end 
this conflict? Thank you. 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] I have already answered a part of your 
question. As to various methods, whether they should be 
military or nonmilitary, we also regard it as possible that one 
may use other weapons and other means in order to regain the 
rights of the Palestinians. We accept that such a possibility 
exists. If the issue is taken seriously, we will be able to put 
forward some clear proposals. 
  [JAHAN-E EQTESAD correspondent Bitaraf] I hope you are not 
too tired. Concerning youth, as we can see in society not much 
has been done, although newspapers write about it and officials 
make announcements. What are your views regarding the youth 
issue? This is my first question. 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] I am also aware of this issue. The 
needs of the young people are greater than what we are doing for 
them at the moment. We have started fundamental work in the 
Supreme Youth Council. We have started discussions on all the 
different issues that concern the young, such as guidance, 
sports, radio and television, employment, marriage, and other 
similar topics that will be gradually announced. I think this 
will be a long-term undertaking. It is difficult for us to 
achieve satisfactory results immediately in all these issues. 
  [Correspondent Bitaraf] Your Excellency, Mr. President, 
during the first plan the stock market was in practice not 
included in the course of privatization [as heard]. Do you have 
any plans for reactivating the stock market during the second 
plan or not? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] To say that it was not included is not 
correct. We attached importance to the stock market in the 
first plan. During the first two years, the stock market became 
very active. After the revolution, the stock market declined 
during the war. During the first plan it was made active. It 
stagnated for a couple of years, but again during last year the 
stock market has been active. A few days ago, when I opened the 
computerized site of the stock market, it was reported to me 
that in the entire period before the revolution they had 190 
billion rials of dealings in the stock market, but during the 
past five years of the first plan they have had 1,500 billion 
rials worth of dealings. During last year we have had the 
highest figure. I think that during the second plan as the 
factories come into production the stock market will be made 
more active. Our factories were in a bad state during the war. 
The stock market does not accept [as heard]. Many factories 
wish to participate, but they could not provide the necessary 
degree of confidence that the stock market requires. In the 
past five years, the performance of many companies and factories 
has gradually improved. The stock market admits them with 
greater speed. I think that during the second plan we shall 
witness a more satisfactory growth. 
  Is that all? Well, we thank you for your patience and we 
hope that the issues that were raised here will be reflected in 
the media truthfully and correctly. God be with you. Goodbye.

  [Text] In his Friday prayers sermons in Tehran today, 
Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, the acting Friday prayers leader of 
Tehran, stressed: The Saudis act in harmony with America, and 
their inability to stage and manage the magnificent hajj rites 
has now become abundantly clear. 
  The acting Friday prayers leader of Tehran referred to King 
Fahd's remarks on 'Id al-Qurban [Feast of the Immolation--20 May 
1994], saying: By exploiting the resolvable differences between 
Iran and the United Arab Emirates concerning the Abu Musa 
Island, the Saudis seek to blackmail us. Although they 
constantly state that hajj is not a stage for political issues, 
nonetheless Fahd, in his speech on 'Id al-Qurban, tried to 
achieve the political objectives of the Saudi Government. 
  Ayatollah Jannati then referred to the Enjoining Good, 
Prohibiting Vice Week, which is to start on 11 June and called 
for the media to pay serious attention to this principle so as 
to clarify and explain it to the public. He emphasized the need 
for everyone to be sensitive toward this principle, and said: In 
the fight against vice, one must not stop at peripheral issues; 
instead, efforts must be made to resolutely confront the 
fundamental vices that constitute the root of corruption. In 
this way, major sources of corruption must be pursued and dealt 
with. 
  In another part of his remarks, the acting Friday prayers 
leader of Tehran alluded to the government's recent call to 
retailers to place price tags on their goods. He said: We hope 
that this step may constitute a good method for confronting 
those responsible for high prices. 
  He also referred to the occasion of Muharram [first month in 
lunar calendar] and said that extensive mourning ceremonies 
should be staged in the best possible way during this period. 
He added: Just as the eminent leader of the revolution has 
said, during this month, one must refrain from superstitious 
acts.

  [Text] Sanaa, 9 Jun (INA)--Yemeni press sources have 
reported that the legitimate Yemeni forces have recently been 
able to impose their full control over the military positions of 
the forces of rebellion and secession in the city of Aden. 
  Military reports published today by the newspaper ITHNAN WA 
'ISHRUN MAYU, issued by the Yemeni General People's Congress 
[GPC], said that the Yemeni Armed Forces are currently stationed 
in the areas of al-Mansurah, al-Haswah, al-Mina', Madinat 
al-Sha'b, and al-Burayqah areas inside the city of Aden after 
they imposed their full control on the Salah al-Din garrison, 
and the al-Jala' and Saba' brigades in the city. 
  The military reports said that the Yemeni forces were able 
to 
tighten their control on all the military positions established 
by the rebels inside the city, and to clear these areas of 
military resistance. 
  The paper said that the legitimate forces have imposed their 
full control on the Aden Airport in the Khormaskar area, which 
is being besieged by the legitimate forces. 
  The paper added that a number of military commanders, who 
were misled by the secessionists, were captured by the 
legitimate forces, including the commander of the secessionists' 
3d Armored Brigade, who is called al-Baqri and who had earlier 
fled 'Imran area, north of Sanaa, at the beginning of the war. 
  The reports said that several secessionist military 
personnel 
fled into the quarters of the city of Aden and began to use 
civilians as human shields to protect themselves. 
  In another development, military reports revealed that the 
legitimate forces are in control of important areas and 
directorates in the Hadhramaut Governorate, east Yemen. These 
reports added that the legitimate forces imposed their control 
on the areas of Yafi', east of the city of al-Mukalla, the 
stronghold of 'Ali Salim al-Bid. These forces have also captured 
the areas of al-'Abr, Bi'r 'Ali, and Brum, approximately 30 km 
west of al-Mukalla. 
  The legitimate forces also advanced into vast areas in the 
Hadhramaut Governorate, which the secessionists have planted 
with mine fields in an attempt to obstruct the legitimate 
forces' advance toward the city of al-Mukalla, which is now 
besieged from all directions by the legitimate forces. 
  The military sources said that the legitimate Yemeni forces 
are now in control of the Hadhramaut Governorate, with the 
exception of three positions taken by the secessionists as 
strongholds. These areas are al-Mukalla, Sihut, and al-Riyan 
Airport.

Prophet which changed the course of world history, your sons 
from the combatants of the Armed Forces, and the People's 
Defence carried the message of this nation's first combatants to

determination of men, struggle by the brave, faithful Sudanese 
nation, and belief in the unity of the country. In response to 
the stratagem of the enemies, routing the scattered remnants of 
the treacherous army of the rebellion, your brave sons from the 
Armed Forces and the Peoples Defence at 0900 this morning on 11 
June, invaded enemy positions in the usurped town of Kajo Kaji 
bravely and forcefully restored to the bold an honored and 
respected wedding feast. Praise be to God. The scattered 
remnants of the outlaws' army fled leaving behind their 
equipment and abandoning their positions. 
  O you, the generous people of Sudan, the Armed Forces which 
is advancing from one position to another in order to restore to 
this country its respectability, power, and territorial 
integrity, confirms to the distinguished people of Sudan that it 
will [words indistinct] in defence of this soil and its people,

At the same time it stresses to the rebel John Garang and to 
all who help him that the path of peace and the vision of peace 
is as clear as the midday sun and the march of the proverbial 
heroes who recaptured Kajo Kaji today will continue until final 
victory is achieved by God's grace. 
  We hope this message will be accepted. Congratulations to 
the distinguished and heroic people of Sudan. Congratulations 
to the Armed Forces and the People's Defence. God is great and 
glory be to Sudan.

  [Text] Ambassador Melissa Wells, the special envoy of the 
American President Bill Clinton, arrived in Khartoum today. She 
was received at the airport by al-Sayyid 'Umar Yusuf Baridu, 
first undersecretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and his 
excellency the American ambassador to the Sudan together with 
some officials. 
  Ambassador Melissa Wells, who was appointed during the past 
two weeks by the American president, will concentrate her 
mission on the support of peace efforts and humanitarian aid. 
It is to be noted that Wells had visited the Sudan formerly in 
1981. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, Melissa Wells, special envoy of U.S. 
President Bill Clinton to Sudan, gave Sudan television the 
following report: 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] I want to ask 
you about your purpose for visiting Sudan. What are you going 
to do? Have you any message for the president? 
  [Wells] I was just recently, a couple of weeks, appointed as 
President Clinton's special representative on the Sudan, and my 
brief in this job is to promote the regional peace effort that 
is currently under way to bring an end to the war in the south 
and to help smooth delivery of humanitarian assistance. And, 
yes, I will be carrying a letter for President Bashir from 
President Clinton. 
  [Correspondent] Will your visit be (?focused on) relations 
or 
it is an informal (?visit)? 
  [Wells] No, I hope that we can engage constructively in a 
dialogue as concerns the peace in the south. I have to my right 
here the president's ambassador to your government Donald 
Petterson who covers a much broader, wider range of issues and 
does so from day to day. My focus is specifically in terms of 
promoting the peace effort. 
  [Correspondent] Have you visited any countries before you 
came to Sudan? 
  [Wells] Yes, I started out in Kenya, then went to Uganda, 
Ethiopia, I have just come from Eritrea and now I am here. 
  [Correspondent] You are going to visit Waw [southern Sudan] 
and (?rebellion) have you visited Sudan before? 
  [Wells] Waw I have been to before, when I was just telling 
my 
friends here that my family and I made a long, lovely trip 
through the Sudan in December 1981. And we had some mechanical 
difficulties in Waw and so we spent a few days there and I 
remember how very generous the people were. They have beautiful 
melons in Waw and we bought a lot of them because, you know, not 
much food to buy along the way. And as we left at night, we 
were driving at night to avoid the heat, they saw us leaving and 
they pushed all these melons as gifts through our window. It 
was very touching. 
  [Correspondent] In Kenya and Uganda did you find or meet 
John 
Garang? 
  [wells] No, no I have not met Mr. Garang. I hope to meet him 
later. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abdallah al-Hajj: "Nahnah Tells AL-HAYAH: </F>
Salvation Front's Split Was Expected"] 
  [Text] Jeddah -- Mahfoud Nahnah, leader of the Algerian 
Reform Grouping Movement (HAMAS) [as published; HAMAS is 
acronymn for Islamic Society Movement], has cast doubt on the 
ability of the leaders of the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] to 
stop the current acts of violence in Algeria. He affirmed that 
the use of arms "will never resolve the Algerian crisis." In a 
statement to AL-HAYAH in Jeddah, he urged a return "to the 
sensible option and the need for all political partners in the 
Algerian arena to sit together around the dialogue table, lay 
down their arms, and convince each other by reasonable and 
legitimate methods." 
  He drew attention to the fact that HAMAS has chosen 
dialogue. 
He added that "dialogue in the end led to closer views and led 
to a meeting between the Algerian defense minister and the FIS 
leaders in prison." Referring to the "split within FIS," he 
said that "such a thing was expected and will continue until the 
appearance of evidence to the contrary, especially after one of 
the FIS founders declared that the issue of the current violence 
in Algeria can be resolved neither by Cheik Abbasi Madani, nor 
by Cheik Ali Belhadj, nor by Cheik Abdelkader Sahraoui -- which 
proves that the violence has gone too far and is out of control." 
  Nahnah warned against interference by "opportunists, the 
economic mafia, criminals, fools, thieves, and people with 
ulterior motives acting under the cover of the prevailing 
violence in Algeria." He reaffirmed that the policy of taking 
up arms "will never solve the Algerian crisis." 
  Nahnah criticized the "exploitation of Islam, culture, and 
democracy for personal gain and the involvement of these matters 
in the issue of national dialogue in Algeria." He urged 
"everyone to give up and sacrifice his personal interests in 
favor of Algeria's general interests and the unity of its 
people." 
  He spoke of the need to "purify the dialogue issue" and 
called on the people concerned to "join the dialogue without 
seeking to settle historical, economic, or political scores, 
because such a dialogue would take us to safe shores at the 
earliest possible time and the least cost." 
  Nahnah urged the Algerian leadership to "declare frankly 
that 
it is not hostile to Islam and to clarify its position on the 
question of foreign aid and the way of settling the Algerian 
state's debts." He criticized the "tardiness of successive 
Algerian governments in rescheduling debts." He called for "a 
frank declaration of the reasons for and causes of its delay in 
settling this matter." 
  He also stressed that the old economic laws and regulations 
should be abolished and new laws promulgated to free the 
economy, investments, and specialization. He urged the current 
Algerian Government "to announce its boycott of the members of 
the former socialist regime and its bankrupt symbols, and to 
have the full courage to move on to a new political, economic, 
and social phase." 
  He warned "the Islamists and those who promote the 
ideologies 
of al-Khawarij and al-Hashshashin [renegades and assassins, old 
Islamic sects] and seek to foment sedition and chop off heads 
without clear reasons" that they "will meet the same fate as the 
al-Khawarij and al-Hashshashin in history." 
  On the current situation in Algeria, Nahnah said: "Algeria 
is witnessing blind sedition. Our motto will continue to be 
dialogue, tolerance, and the abandonment of personal interests 
in favor of the nation's higher interests, particularly that of 
upholding God's religion without conflict with the divine 
teachings, either in words or in deeds in society." 
  He praised the style of President Liamine Zeroual's 
government in dealing with "the FIS and in bringing together the 
political partners around the dialogue table, and releasing some 
FIS leaders." He asked: "If that is going to continue, what is 
the point of killing people and spilling blood on Algerian soil?"

<F P=106> ["Closeup" column by Salamah Ahmad Salamah: "Israel's Long </F>
Arm"] 
  [Text] Those who think that Israel's long arm of aggression 
will not seek to attain its goals under peace are receiving 
indications to the contrary that what Israel fails to attain by 
tricks it, will try to attain through terrorism and aggression. 
The latest Israeli aerial attack on south Lebanon, which killed 
45 civilians as they slept, is proof that Israel at peace is not 
much different from Israel at war. It was Israel that abducted 
Lebanese leader Mustafa al-Dirani on the pretext of 
interrogating him to learn the fate of an Israeli pilot who was 
kidnapped in 1986. When some Hizballah members retaliated with 
certain trivial and heedless operations, not against the Israeli 
forces but against Israel's agents in the security strip 
established by Israel in south Lebanon, Israel used these 
incidents as a pretext to launch a bestial operation against 
what it called Hizballah bases in south Lebanon. 
  This barbaric aggressive behavior was not condemned by the 
United States. The aircraft that launched the aggression are 
U.S.-made. There are also indications that the United States did 
not oppose the abduction operation to get Lebanese Shiite leader 
Mustafa al-Dirani. U.S. newspapers published reports that the 
CIA requested that he be handed over secretly to interrogate him 
to obtain information about the death of a U.S. hostage in 
1989. This means that the United States, which fights 
terrorism, does not mind taking part in it if there are some 
good results. 
  The Israeli aggression against Lebanon makes one believe 
that 
the U.S. peace efforts to resume the negotiations between Syria 
and Israel have reached a deadlock because of lack of desire on 
the part of the Rabin government to enter serious negotiations 
to achieve a total Israeli withdrawal from the Golan. For no 
sooner had Christopher returned to Washington and declared that 
he would not return to the region late in June as scheduled to 
resume his efforts, than Israel found that the atmosphere was 
ripe to deal several strikes here and there. Rabin seems to 
want to regain some respect in opposition rightist circles and 
face the wrath of the settlers whose fierceness was curtailed by 
certain measures taken within the framework of the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement. 
  Thus, the "peace efforts" seem like a successful public 
relations campaign in favor of Israel, enabling it to continue 
its occupation of Syrian and Lebanese territories and exhausting 
Arab water, as a recent UN report noted, and obtaining arms from 
the United States and the West in return for that fragile 
agreement with the Palestinians.

  [Text] A number of Egyptian and Israeli businessmen have 
agreed to set up a joint venture to build an oil refinery in 
Alexandria at a cost of $1 billion. The refinery will be run by 
a joint company made up of representatives from the Israeli 
specialized group "Merhav" [name as published] and an Egyptian 
company called the "Salim Group." The Egyptian Government has 
promised to buy at least 20 percent of the oil produced by the 
refinery, which will begin operating in early 1997. A plot of 
land has already been bought for the refinery and an agreement 
has been reached with the quarters that will supply the refinery 
with oil. Ambassadors of the two countries have taken part in 
preparing for the meetings between the businessmen.

  [Text] JANA's international affairs editor has commented on 
remarks made by an assistant U.S. Secretary of State, who said 
that his government does not hide its concern over the so-called 
the nuclear capabilities of some states, including the Great 
Jamahiriyah. 
  The editor said: These statements, which U.S. officials are 
not weary of reiterating, can no longer be believed by anyone. 
In fact, they have become the object of world ridicule for 
several reasons, the most important being: 
  1. The Great Jamahiriyah has repeatedly affirmed that it 
does 
not have the capability to possess nuclear weapons and has not 
even thought of possessing them. Nuclear weapons are not the 
subject of its interest, which focuses entirely on planning, 
preparing, and implementing programs to build its economy and 
have sufficient water and food, despite the unjust measures used 
by the imperialist states to obstruct this and deprive the 
Libyan Arab people of the chance make progress on their land. 
  2. The U.S. official was not embarrassed to claim that his 
government feels concern over the countries he mentioned, 
including the Great Jamahiriyah. Who feels concern toward whom? 
The small people seeking to build development and progress on 
the basis of adhering to their sovereignty and independence are 
the ones who feel concern over the nuclear states and their 
arsenals of weapons against mankind, environment, security, and 
peace in the world and over these states' blackmail behavior 
against small people to sequester their independence, rob their 
wealth, and impose tutelage on them. 
  3. If the U.S. Government really cares for world security 
and 
stability, it should have focused its attention on the Israeli 
enemy, who has proudly declared before the world that it 
possesses nuclear bombs and weapons of mass destruction. 
Although this constitutes a real danger to the security, peace, 
and stability of the region and the world, the U.S. 
Administration is not worried by it. On the contrary, it has 
supported and participated with the Israelis in developing these 
weapons and helping them acquire more of them. 
  The editor went on to say: We are not surprised by this U.S. 
stand because we know the reasons why the U.S. Government has 
not taken any measures against the Israelis. Foremost of these 
reasons is that no U.S. president can win the U.S. presidential 
elections and enter the White House without the funds and 
support of the Jews. We also know that the real capital of the 
United States is not Washington but Tel Aviv. 
  Regarding the warnings and threats contained in the U.S. 
official's remarks, the U.S. Government is the first to realize 
that this style is futile with the Great Jamahiriyah and its 
free and sovereign people.

  [Text] Rabat, Jun. 10 (MAP) --- Moroccan Premier Abdellatif 
Filali presented Thursday to the parliament the broad lines of 
the action program of the new government in matters of economic, 
social, cultural and foreign policies. 
  Priority will be given to the completion of territorial 
integrity through the consecration of the return of the Saharan 
provinces to the homeland and the carrying on of efforts for the 
settlement of the territorial dispute with Spain over Sebta and 
Mellilia and the neighboring islands, the new prime minister 
said. 
  Filali solemnly said the government 'will see to it that 
nothing put at stake the legitimate recovery by Morocco of its 
Saharan provinces and that the rights and peace of Moroccan 
citizens be strictly respected'. 
  Concerning Sebta and Mellilia, Filali said wisdom and shared 
interests recommend that Spain and Morocco resort to dialog and 
understanding to settle the dispute over the Presidios. 
  The government deems that King Hassan II's proposal to set 
up 
a reflection cell as the best means to reach a solution that 
respects Morocco's sovereign rights and preserves Spanish 
economic interests. 
  Underlining the national mobilization around the territorial 
integrity issue, Filali said 'We hope that we can rely on this 
same mobilization to address, together, the sensitive internal 
issues we are facing up regarding the promotion of human rights, 
the improvement of the public service, the sound management of 
justice on the one hand and the improvement of the living 
standards of our co-citizens, of employment and of education on 
the other'. 
  Filali pledged that the government will endeavor to 
consolidate the state of law and to see to it that all citizens 
enjoy their rights before listing all the initiatives made in 
this field during the past years. He said the government 
undertakes to further promote the respect and protection of 
human rights and to resolutely act to enhance the civil and 
political rights of citizens, improve their economic, social and 
cultural rights and consolidate the rights of women, children 
and vulnerable populations. 
  At the economic and financial scale, Filali said the 
government will carry on efforts for the modernization of the 
Moroccan economy through the adoption of 'an economic and social 
policy based, in the short run, on maintaining the major basic 
balances and curbing public deficits'. 
  The government also pledges 'to speed up the privatization 
process' and to continue the quest for a sustained development 
particularly in matters of employment. 
  In this regard, Filali underlined that employment upgrading 
will be at the core of the action of the government, which will 
encourage all job-generating projects. 
  In the social field, the government 'will strive to meet the 
basic needs of the population in matters of housing and health 
through the development of a social solidarity network.' 
  The government will also 'continue, in line with the royal 
guidelines, discussions with the economic and social partners 
within a franc, responsible and constructive dialog with a view 
to edifying a prosperous society that opens new horizons for the 
lower layers of the society.' 
  The prime minister stressed Morocco's will to efficiently 
participate in the edification of the grand Maghreb and to help 
Arab countries settle the Middle-East problems. 
  As to Moroccan-European relations, Abdellatif Filali said 
these relations which 'have developed through years are still 
marked by some disequilibrium in trade, economic and financial 
matters'. Moroccan-European discussions on a new partnership 
accord 'are facing serious difficulties and suffer from a 
divergence in approach and vision', the prime minister said, 
adding the offer made by the union concerning a new partnership 
form was deemed insufficient by Morocco, which presented, last 
February, counter-proposals to the union based on a 
geo-strategic vision. 
  'Morocco cannot conclude a new accord with the union, unless 
it is founded on sound and balanced bases, guarantees a genuine 
and a mutually beneficial partnership and meets Morocco's 
requirements in social and economic matters', he said. 
  The prime minister undertook to inform the parliament on the 
evolution of these questions and renewed his will to open up the 
channels of dialog with the parliament and create a new climate 
that consolidates the dignity of institutions. 
  The governmental declaration, made following the setting up 
last Tuesday of a new cabinet, will be discussed by the 
parliament as of next Monday before the confidence vote.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Jordanian Handshake"] </F>
  [Text] For the first time in the history of 
Israeli-Jordanian relations Jordan has agreed to host the 
bilateral talks in its territory. For the first time it is 
willing to host an official Israeli delegation for at 
international economic forum. These two developments are enough 
to indicate the change in Israeli-Jordanian relations over the 
last week. There are in addition, however, reports on a series 
of economic projects of great importance to both Jordan and 
Israel which are in an advanced stage of negotiations. Among 
these projects are the Red Sea-Dead Sea Canal Project; a joint 
park in the 'Arava; establishing a civilian tourism 
subcommittee; building a road from al-'Aqabah to Taba via Elat, 
and establishing a tripartite Israeli-Jordanian-Palestinian 
framework for dealing with banking and financial issues. 
  This assortment of issues indicates that Jordan views the 
peace process not merely in declarative terms, but as a means to 
advance and implement its vital interests. Jordan no longer 
regards itself as the guardian and representative of the 
Palestinian problem. From now on it will try to compete with 
the Palestinians over the benefits accruing from the peace 
process. 
  The Gaza-Jericho agreement undoubtedly facilitated the 
Washington talks this week. Jordan's concern lest it will lose 
economic strongholds such as the banks and the supremacy of the 
Jordanian dinar to the Palestinians also contributed to the 
success. These strongholds harbor a lot of political power 
which can influence the functioning of the Palestinian autonomy 
as well as Jordan's economy, which is at a dangerous low. 
  Israel, for its part, has always wanted to maintain normal 
neighborly relations with Jordan, and such relations have 
existed de facto. The open bridges policy inaugurated by Dayan, 
the generally calm border maintained by Jordan, and the secret 
meetings between Israeli leaders and King Husayn only 
strengthened the relations between the two countries. Israel 
and Jordan have both regarded each other as strategic partners 
for foiling the establishment of a Palestinian state. 
  Israel is interested both in the autonomy's success and in 
strengthening Jordan's status in the region. In fact, the two 
are mutually dependent. Without cooperation with Jordan the 
Palestinian economy will crumble and will become a dead weight 
on Israel's economy; without cooperation with the autonomy, on 
the other hand, the Jordanian economy might suffer deeper 
unemployment, a loss of income, and the rise of radical elements. 
  Now that the Palestinian problem has been detached from the 
negotiations with Jordan and has become an independent problem, 
negotiations with Jordan can become an easier affair. It is 
relatively easy to solve the border demarcation problem between 
Israel and Jordan, because this border does not constitute a 
strategic buffer as does the Golan Heights. Other controversial 
issues can be solved via reasonable negotiations. With a 
modicum of goodwill these negotiations will resemble 
negotiations between friendly countries. 
  It is still hard to assess whether Jordan has proceeded with 
Syria's blessing or despite its opposition. Syria has still not 
given up its efforts to delay the process until negotiations 
with it score significant progress. Until the agreements are 
signed, we should be cautious in our assessment of the process. 
There is no doubt, however, that the quick progress made in 
negotiations with Jordan could facilitate the negotiations with 
Syria and Israel's acceptance by the entire Arab world.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Dan Margalit: "After the Revolution"] </F>
  [Text] The government logged a political achievement in 
its agreement with Jordan. Even the opposition did not find 
fault in it. If the prime minister's meeting with the Jordanian 
monarch gave birth to an agreement to conduct further 
negotiations in Elat and al-'Aqabah instead of Washington; and 
if there will now be deliberations on demarcation of borders and 
jointly combating terrorism, as well as the distribution of 
water resources, this will mark important progress. Even if in 
practice most of those components already exist, formalizing 
them in a joint, official, and signed document is significant. 
  Yitzhaq Rabin and Shim'on Peres, who were weaned on the 
Hashemite theory in Israeli foreign policy, remain loyal to it 
despite the historic breakthrough they made in the dialogue with 
the PLO. They feel they have achieved a great deal up to now, 
but they appear to be depending on King Husayn to reach another 
bilateral agreement with them, which would lead to full peace. 
If that is the case, they will be disappointed. 
  In November 1993, Peres returned from extensive discussions 
with King Husayn in Amman. They agreed on a far-reaching 
document. The king did not want to leave the ceremony to his 
brother, the crown prince. He insisted on including his 
signature on the agreement. After that, Peres pursued him like a 
groom chasing after a reluctant bride, and repeatedly heard from 
the monarch that the wedding ceremony would be held "in the 
spring" and then "in the summer," and now the best we can hope 
for from these warm ties is the fall and autumn leaves. 
  Why do Rabin and Peres believe that Husayn cannot trick them 
a third time? Because there is a limit? Because one cannot go 
on cheating forever? There are people who really do not dare 
deceive and cheat, but there are leaders for whom the third time 
is easier than the first. Husayn, who is ailing and left 
yesterday for medical tests in the United States, is one of them. 
  The renewed clinging to Husayn is due to the political 
weariness of the prime minister and foreign minister. Historian 
Arnold Toynbee once explained that a leadership cannot carry out 
two revolutions. It is possible that the gambit with the PLO 
along the Oslo-Washington-Cairo axis was a revolution by Rabin 
and Peres, or by one of them, and that they do not have any more 
steam to continue on to other destinations. This fatigue also 
explains their tortuous and bewildering stands about the 
uncovering of the Jerusalem document following a thorough 
parliamentary investigation by Dan Meridor and Ben Begin. 
  Under these conditions, Rabin and Peres do not have the 
strength to race ahead to full autonomy as the stage before a 
permanent solution. It is easier for them to hope that the 
Palestinians will not manage to organize elections or uphold for 
long the (so far successful) Gaza-Jericho agreement. In fact, 
there is a new target date: By the 1996 Knesset elections, 
Rabin and Peres want to make do with the early empowerment stage 
on the West bank. That is much less ambitious than the year of 
strategic decisionmaking they had earmarked for 1994. 
  The alternative to quickened negotiations with the 
Palestinians is not pulling back to the granting of sewage, 
education, transportation, and tourism rights to the residents 
of Janin and Nabulus. Yasir 'Arafat received an undertaking to 
hold serious negotiations and Israel has an interest in 
fulfilling that promise. It would be wrong to treat subclauses, 
in themselves sound, as an adequate alternative. 
  Rabin and Peres are not advancing the negotiations with 
Hafiz 
al-Asad. True, that is difficult. Al-Asad came under 
constructive criticism in recent weeks. He is stubborn and 
archaic, and immersed in a long gone world. His guests found 
him worried that he will end up like Nicolae Ceaucescu, who 
started by opening a narrow skylight to a new gust of wind and 
was hurled away by a hurricane. For the first time, western 
leaders refer to al-Asad as an "idiot." 
  Al-Asad wants the entire Golan Heights, and is even 
including 
al-Hammah, which did not belong to Syria prior to 1967. He is 
demanding the demilitarization of the eastern Upper Galilee, 
which will return Tel Hay to the days of Yosef Trumpeldor in 
March 1920. His stubbornness over the time factor for the 
withdrawal and the security arrangements are annoying. 
  Patience has so far characterized the Israeli position in 
the 
negotiations and it seems that it is being replaced by 
desperation and preparations for a anemic scenario: to reach 
the 1996 general elections with early empowerment in the pocket 
and an advanced Israeli-Jordanian agreement. 
  That will not happen, and that cannot be all there is. If 
the government focuses only on those two important but secondary 
elements, Labor will move into the opposition benches. If the 
idea is to disrupt the political settlement, then Israel has 
better governments for the job.

<F P=106> [Report by Moti Bassok] </F>
  [Text] Several weeks ago, former Jerusalem Mayor Teddy 
Kollek invited Jordanian King Husayn to come to Jerusalem and 
pray at the Temple Mount mosques. The appeal to Husayn was made 
with the knowledge of Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres. So far, Kollek has not received an 
answer. 
  Kollek contacted Husayn through a third party associated 
with 
the former mayor and the king. The mediator made a special trip 
to Jordan to deliver the invitation. Kollek suggested that 
Husayn come to Jerusalem openly, aboard a special helicopter, 
and pray at the graves of his forefathers in the city. The 
climax of the visit was to have been festive prayers at the 
Temple Mount mosques. Kollek suggested that Husayn return to 
Jordan after the prayers, without meeting any Israeli officials. 
Kollek advised Rabin and Peres before making the proposal, and 
they expressed no opposition. 
  Kollek confirmed the details of this report yesterday. 
According to him, he has not yet received the king's reply, 
although a few weeks have passed since the invitation was given. 
In the interim, the king underwent ear surgery, and he is 
currently in the United States for medical treatment. It is not 
clear whether he intends to respond to the former mayor's offer. 
  It is not clear whether Kollek's offer to Husayn was made at 
his own initiative, as the former mayor of Jerusalem, or whether 
it was made at Rabin and Peres' request. In any event, the 
offer was meant to serve important Israeli interests, as well as 
obvious Jordanian interests, at this critical juncture for both 
parties. Had Husayn accepted the offer, he would have prayed 
publicly on Temple Mount, under extensive media coverage, before 
Yasir 'Arafat, and this would have lent support to his demand 
for involvement in the management of the Muslim holy sites in 
Jerusalem. 
  A Husayn visit at this time could help Israel resist the 
pressure for an 'Arafat visit to Temple Mount and help weaken 
the Palestinian demand for control over East Jerusalem and the 
Muslim holy sites. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0500 GMT on 13 June 
reports that "Teddy Kollek expressed regret over the fact that 
his proposal to Jordan's King Husayn to visit Jerusalem and pray 
at the Temple Mount mosques before Yasir 'Arafat was leaked to 
the press." Kollek said "that so far, he has not received any 
reply from Jordan with regard to his proposal."]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Peace Now leader Tzali Reshef in </F>
Tunis, following his meeting with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat on 
10 June, by Yoram Ronen -- live] 
  [Text] [Ronen] 'Arafat will not be coming to Jericho next 
week. Why has he put off his arrival in the autonomy? 
  [Reshef] We neither asked him nor got an answer to that 
question. At the same time, 'Arafat and his men reiterated that 
they intend to come to Jericho within the next few weeks. In 
fact, we saw that the entire entourage has completed its 
preparations for its arrival in the land.... 
  [Ronen, interrupting] Their land. 
  [Reshef] Our land, their land; the land both of us will have 
to share, as all of us realize at this point. I must say I 
encountered a very optimistic approach and a great deal of faith 
that as soon as they arrive things will work out, that their 
dialogue with their people and our people will be better. The 
atmosphere here is very encouraging for an Israeli. You expect 
to arrive at the headquarters -- a quasi-military command -- of 
an organization that fought you for many years, but you 
encounter an administrative system getting ready to deal with 
daily affairs as government ministries in our country do. 
  [Ronen] As you probably know, what worries Israelis is that 
'Arafat and his men intend at a very early stage to try to bring 
the negotiations forward, including on the question of 
Jerusalem. Did you discern any such intentions in your meeting 
with 'Arafat? 
  [Reshef] The purpose of our meeting was to convey a rather 
tough message to 'Arafat concerning the reverberations in Israel 
of his remarks in Johannesburg and elsewhere, and to tell him 
that through such talk he is destroying the peace process with 
his own two hands. We told him that the faith of the Israeli 
people in the peace process and its willingness to make progress 
was largely up to him. I think his answer to us, one of total 
commitment to the peace process, was a kind of reaction to our 
message. We explicitly asked him about the battle for Jerusalem 
and when Jerusalem would be put on the negotiating table. 
'Arafat categorically replied that all the administrative 
functions of the autonomy would be located in Jericho and that 
Orient House was going to keep a very low profile. He emphasized 
that he does not want to create a crisis over the issue of 
Orient House because there are no intentions to upgrade the 
profile of its activities. Quite the contrary, he said, Jericho 
is going to become the center. 
  [Ronen] Does 'Arafat plan to come to Jerusalem to pray at 
the al-Aqsa Mosque, as he has said several times? 
  [Reshef] He did not say anything of the sort, and we did not 
ask him about it. At the same time, the messages he conveyed 
throughout the conversation were ones of great faith that the 
process will advance. We also presented the difficulties 
expected in the interim arrangement, such as the continued 
existence of the settlements. He told us in English: Where 
there is a will there is a way [previous nine words in English]. 
In other words, he believes all the difficulties, such as the 
settlements and other issues, will be overcome. I have the 
feeling that the very fact that they are getting a piece of land 
to start administering and that they see some light at the end 
of the tunnel puts them in a much more optimistic mood and they 
see a rosier picture of the chances of pursuing the process than 
we do. In this respect, we found a very conciliatory man who 
very much wants to pursue the process. This far exceeded our 
expectations before the meeting. 
  [Ronen] Tzali Reshef in Tunis, thank you very much and have 
a safe journey home. 
  [Reshef] Thank you and see you soon.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Ministry Director General </F>
Uri Savir by Me'ir Einstein; place not given -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Einstein] I understand that 
the issue of Jerusalem and the location of the Palestinian 
economic authority were also discussed at the meeting of the 
donor countries in Paris. I believe the issue first came up in 
the document submitted by the PLO which stated that the economic 
authority would be established in Jerusalem; however, you 
managed to foil this intention and the economic authority will 
be set up in Jericho. 
  [Savir] We told the Palestinians that we were very 
interested in promoting the agreement between us. We said that 
a great deal of time had been wasted over words and that we were 
facing a test, a new reality, which would require patience since 
things do not change for the better within a day. We said that 
the time had come to improve conditions on the ground, and, at 
the present stage, the autonomous areas were in the Gaza Strip 
and Jericho. Second, we promised to cooperate in these efforts 
on condition that they complied with the framework of the 
Declaration of Principles [DOP]. According to the DOP, all the 
autonomy institutions must be in the Gaza Strip or Jericho. 
This was stated by the Norwegian chairman at the meeting and 
also by Nabil Sha'th at the concluding news conference. 
  [Einstein] It was decided at the conference to transfer $42 
million to the autonomy in order to meet expenses for the next 
three months. What will happen after that? 
  [Savir] Look, there are commitments to provide $720 million 
this year. The donor countries contributed $42 million for 
current expenses above the $130 million previously agreed upon. 
I think that at the beginning of the process, a greater 
emphasis was placed on investments because the various countries 
and their industries seek to profit from investing in joint 
projects by Israel and the Palestinian autonomy in the 
territories. I think that not enough thought was devoted to the 
need to give the autonomy a chance to get itself established and 
pay the first salaries before they can collect taxes and customs 
duties. Afterwards, the autonomy will have to start financing 
itself through taxes and its agreement with Israel. Also, 
investments in infrastructure will improve financial conditions. 
I believe that what is important is that the international 
community gave this agreement a very great chance for success. 
There are many areas of tension in the world but in this case 
there was a meeting of representatives from over 40 countries, 
led by the United States, the EC, Japan, the Scandinavian 
countries and others, who said that they wanted the autonomy and 
its relations with Israel to succeed, and the Palestinians will 
now have to prove that these funds will indeed be used for the 
development of the economy. It is important that everyone learn 
to equate peace with economic improvement. That is the really 
big test. 
  [Einstein] When will there be another conference of the 
donor countries? 
  [Savir] Approximately one month from now in Paris. This 
mechanism is very important not only to recruit contributions 
and future investments but also to monitor the auditing 
processes of the Palestinian economic institutions which are 
currently being established. At the conference, the 
Palestinians reported the establishment of their new economic 
body PECDAR [Palestinian Economic Committee on Development and 
Reconstruction]. The donor states insist on knowing where the 
money is going and what the autonomy's budget is. They are 
working closely with the World Bank and these issues will be 
examined periodically and the Palestinians realize that they had 
better cooperate in these processes. We should also help, 
because ultimately the real test lies in bringing about an 
economic improvement that leads to greater stability and 
security. 
  Following the Israeli withdrawal and the PLO's assumption of 
control in the area, the Palestinian residents will want to see 
their lives improve. The international community will want to 
examine these processes on a regular basis, at least at the 
beginning. The atmosphere at the talks was very good. The 
Palestinian delegation told us that a great deal of time had 
recently been wasted on various statements and that we must 
continue implementing and promoting the DOP in the field and get 
back on track with regard to establishing an entirely new 
relationship between the Palestinians and Israel. [passage

  [Excerpt] At today's weekly cabinet session, Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin reiterated that special steps would be 
taken to prevent the PLO from establishing governing 
institutions in Jerusalem. Such activities include preparations 
for PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat's arrival in the territories. 
Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Raz] The cabinet held a routine meeting 
today, contrary to recent sessions which were called urgently to 
deal with political crises such as housing shortages and the 
Kupat Holim sick fund debt. The focus of today's session was on 
Jerusalem. This, at least, was the impression given by Economy 
and Planning Minister Shim'on Shetrit. 
  [Shetrit] It is conspicuously evident to us that clear steps 
will be necessary to prevent the establishment of PLO political 
institutions of a governing nature, as opposed to the 
professional and non-profit institutions which existed in the 
past. 
  [Raz] What about a visit to Jerusalem by 'Arafat? 
  [Shetrit] Such a visit to Jerusalem was not discussed today, 
and the prevailing assessment is that it will not take place. 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1000 GMT on 12 June adds 
that "the ministers were briefed by security officials on 
political developments and the situation in the territories and 
the Palestinian autonomous areas. The cabinet still does not 
know the date of 'Arafat's planned visit to the Gaza Strip and 
Jericho." IDF radio notes that "the ministers were also briefed 
on developments on the Jordanian track, and the ministers 
expressed the assessment that despite all their fuss, the 
Syrians had been informed in advance." 
  [In a recorded passage, Minister Shim'on Shetrit says: "We 
received the impression that except for some lip service, there 
is no real Syrian opposition. This is a comprehensive process 
which pertains to the entire Middle East, and Jordan realized 
almost at the last minute that it could miss the train. It is 
good that Jordan recognized this fact, and the way it is 
participating in the process is very encouraging."] 
  [Raz] Here is what Agriculture Minister Ya'aqov Tzur had to 
say. 
  [Tzur] In my opinion, police activity is showing good signs 
in the field. I personally drove through Jericho several days 
ago and I must say that seeing a Palestinian police base in what 
used to be the Hanan camp and witnessing the joint patrols and 
the quiet in the town indicate a good potential. Therefore, as 
I understand things, the sooner 'Arafat arrives the better for 
the pushing of the financing of economic activity. Let us hope 
that 'Arafat arrives in the Gaza Strip and Jericho not just to 
visit but in order to stay. 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1000 GMT on 12 June also 
reports that the cabinet discussed steps to prevent the 
establishment of Palestinian governing institutions in 
Jerusalem. In a recorded passage Agriculture Minister Zur says: 
"I think that the prime minister's unequivocal statements on 
this matter deterred the Palestinians from making statements and 
adopting positions which contravened the agreement."] 
  [Raz] Minister Tzur definitely sounded optimistic. The 
assessment is that 'Arafat will prefer to fly between the Gaza 
Strip and Jericho via helicopter. The cabinet also prefers this 
option which is much easier from the security standpoint.

  [Text] Beirut, AL-HAYAH -- Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri 
yesterday received Mohammad Kazem Khonsari, the Iranian foreign 
minister's adviser and head of the Middle East and North Africa 
Department, at the head of a diplomatic delegation accompanied 
by Iranian Ambassador to Lebanon Hamayon 'Alizadeh. 
  Khonsari, who earlier visited President Ilyas al-Hirawi, 
Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri, Foreign Minister Faris 
Buwayz, and some Islamic spiritual leaders, said after the 
meeting: "I conveyed to his excellency condolences for the 
martyrs who died in the latest savage Zionist aggression against 
Lebanon. We then discussed regional and international issues as 
well as bilateral relations which we agreed to enhance and 
strengthen with joint cooperation in all fields." 
  He added: "We discussed developments in the region, 
especially the repeated attacks on Lebanon by the Zionist enemy. 
There was identity of views and we agreed that the Zionist 
enemy cannot influence the Lebanese policy with attacks, 
threats, and troublemaking, nor can it affect the Lebanese 
people's resistance which is fully supported by the Lebanese 
Government." He also said that "if anything, all the (Israeli) 
attacks and threats increase the people's and government's unity 
and solidarity against the Zionist enemy. We are with the 
resistance which is a legitimate right of the Lebanese people 
and which has the government's support." 
  On the rumor that some Iranians were among the victims of 
the 
Israeli raid on a Hizballah position in 'Ayn Kawkab east of 
Ba'labakk, Khonsari said: "That is not the case at all. This 
is the first time we have heard such talk." 
  Asked if he had any information about the Iranian diplomats 
who were kidnapped in Lebanon in 1982, he replied: "I have no 
information on that. We expect the Lebanese Government to 
explore the fate of these hostages as it deems fit, particularly 
as they were diplomats kidnapped on this territory. We have no 
accurate knowledge. The Iranian people, the Iranian Government, 
and the families of those brothers all always await positive 
news about them and the necessary measures to free them." 
  On Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani's assertion that the 
four kidnapped people are in Israel, Khonsari said that "one 
possibility is that they are alive and held prisoner by the 
Zionist enemy." 
  He said that Iran is ready "for comprehensive cooperation in 
all fields desired by Lebanon." 
  Meanwhile, a delegation from the International Political 
Studies Center attached to the Iranian Foreign Ministry headed 
by Khadem Haqiqat has visited the Lebanese University and 
discussed with its president, Dr. As'ad Diyab, the possibility 
of direct scientific dialogue between the people concerned. The 
delegation also visited the Arab Information Center. 
  Elsewhere, Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz said yesterday that 
the temporary truce between Lebanon and Israel does not mean 
that the latter will stop its aggressions against Lebanon. He 
added that "the Lebanese people's unity worries Israel and the 
latter has always tried to drive a wedge between the Lebanese 
state and the resistance but we will not fall into that trap." 
  Editors' doyen Milhim Karam quoted him as saying that 
Iranian 
Envoy Khonsari's visit to Lebanon "has been useful and has 
somewhat contributed to the enhancement of trust between the 
state and the resistance. Iran is known to have good relations 
with the Lebanese resistance and that is why it has used that 
weight to effectively contribute to the consolidation of the 
Lebanese entity on foundations that cannot collapse." 
  Buwayz believes that the United States "is not playing the 
role required of it as a mediator, conference sponsor, and 
effective element in the Madrid conference and the entire peace 
process. It is just being a postman but that is not its role. 
It should be playing an effective part." He expressed the hope 
that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher "would bring 
clear U.S. proposals." 
  He said that he "did not agree with those calling for 
withdrawal from the negotiations because withdrawal would play 
into Israeli hands and we will not do it." He praised the work 
and effective presence of the Lebanese Army in the south, adding 
that "we are not stepping up the Army's presence for fear of an 
Israeli strike but the Army has been there for two years and 
that has moral, practical, and military significance."
