Beirut] 
  [Excerpt] Editors Doyen Milhim Karam has cited Chamber of 
Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri as saying that the government will 
be better protected and more prestigious and dignified if it 
lifts all restrictions on the audio and visual media, provided 
that these media are really Lebanese. Birri stressed to the 
editors' doyen that he is one of the advocates of organized 
opposition. He renewed his call for General Michel 'Awn to

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The indictment against Samir 
Ja'ja' and others contains the results of the interrogations of 
the detainees and the information available to the competent 
security and judicial authorities. It reveals that many of the 
accused have received training in Israel and that they had links 
with Israeli intelligence. The interrogations also showed that 
some of them are accomplices in other crimes, such as the 
assassinations of Dani Sham'un and Dr. Ilyas al-Zayik and the 
attempted murder of ministers Elie Hubayqah and Sulayman 
Franjiyah. The indictment points out that the accused possessed 
forged passports and travelled between Cyprus, Juniyah [port in 
Lebanon], and Israel. It also stresses that the accused 
received huge amounts of money for implementing their tasks at 
the direct orders of Ja'ja'.

<F P=106> [Interview with former Hizballah Secretary General Shaykh </F>
Subhi al-Tufayli by Nisrin Nasir-al-Din and Zaynah Ma'luli; 
place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [AL-DIYAR] Shaykh Subhi al-Tufayli, how are 
you? What role are you playing? 
  [Al-Tufayli] As a citizen of this country, I have a right to 
express my opinion. I like our clear rights to be respected. 
Acting on this premise, I don't believe in imposed regimes. 
The al-Ta'if Accord is a formula for a regime on which the 
Lebanese people were not consulted. Therefore, I reject this 
regime. Accordingly, anything that stems from this regime is 
illegitimate because the Lebanese people have not decided on it. 
Therefore, I am an opponent of the regime. 
  Furthermore, I don't believe anyone has the right to 
reconcile with the Zionist entity, which is an oppressor and 
usurper. The Lebanese regime is wrong in trying to reconcile 
with the Zionist enemy. [passage omitted] 
  [AL-DIYAR] What are your specific differences with the 
Lebanese regime? 
  [Al-Tufayli] I oppose the regime's many executive and 
procedural actions. I cannot accept a regime that does not stem 
from the will of the Lebanese or a majority of them. A 
referendum must be held on any formula proposed to the people. 
If the people accept this formula, then they will be 
responsible for their decision. 
  The Chamber of Deputies--which was appointed or elected--was 
elected on the basis of a formula which the people did not 
approve. The formula determined the Chamber, the Chamber did not 
devise the formula. A formula which is not presented to the 
people is not respected, and must not be respected by anyone. 
  [AL-DIYAR] Does this mean you are not pleased with the 
Chamber of Deputies? 
  [Al-Tufayli] The nature of Lebanese officials is essentially 
bad. This is very regrettable. I am not revealing something 
new. The officials in Lebanon, regardless of their positions, do 
not care about the Lebanese people's interests and views. All 
Lebanese officials are interested in is pleasing the party in 
power. For example, in the past the French had the power and 
Lebanese officials were anxious to know whether the French were 
pleased with them. Today the same thing is happening with the 
Syrian brothers. If the Syrians are pleased, there is no 
problem even if the Lebanese people curse these officials. This 
is not the work of honest officials. These officials are 
irresponsible. 
  Hypocrisy is the hallmark of past and current Lebanese 
officials. With such a mentality, we cannot say the people 
govern in Lebanon. The people do not govern at all. From a 
reading of the situation, we emerge with the conclusion that the 
majority of the people are not pleased with the formula or with 
the officials. If some of them are pleased, it is for personal 
reasons or out of fear. [passage omitted] 
  [AL-DIYAR] You have spoken about the Syrian role. What 
about the Iranian role in Lebanon? 
  [Al-Tufayli] The Iranian role is not political. Regardless 
of their abilities or inabilities, the Iranians have not 
interfered in political affairs. The Iranians have two roles. 
The first role is to support the resistance, transfer military 
expertise to it, and back it financially so it can buy weapons 
and other things. The second role is in helping the people dig 
water wells and rebuild destroyed houses, assisting the poor, 
and other social activities. That is all what they have been 
doing. 
  [AL-DIYAR] But they have interfered on some issues? 
  [Al-Tufayli] I don't believe the Syrians consult the 
Iranians. The decision is ultimately a Syrian one. The work the 
Syrians are doing in Lebanon is Syria's responsibility even if 
others consult it. 
  [AL-DIYAR] How are your relations with the Syrians and 
Iranians? 
  [Al-Tufayli] Good; there are no problems. 
  [AL-DIYAR] Are there contacts? 
  [Al-Tufayli] Contacts are held according to need. I am 
usually frank with the Syrians and Iranians. They know this. 
Therefore, the relations are stable and there are no problems. 
  [AL-DIYAR] How are your relations with Hizballah and what 
are the points of disagreement with it? 
  [Al-Tufayli] In fact, there were two viewpoints regarding 
the [parliamentary] elections. I don't like to participate in 
activities I don't believe in. Since I did not believe in the 
formula adopted for the elections, I told my brothers: I will 
not join in this political venture. However, I am at your 
service in other matters. [passage omitted] 
  [AL-DIYAR] What information does al-Hajj al-Dirani have on 
pilot Ron Arad? 
  [Al-Tufayli] In my capacity as a former Hizballah secretary 
general, I know details about Hizballah. Therefore, I can say 
that Ron Arad is not being held by Hizballah or the Iranians. 
The proof is that at some point in the past Hizballah and the 
Iranians carried out a serious search for Arad. This means he 
is not being held by them. 
  [AL-DIYAR] Can we identify the party that might be holding 
Arad? 
  [Al-Tufayli] Some people say the Syrians are holding him. 
However, the Syrians have not only denied this, they have also 
carried out a search for him. Therefore, it is probable that 
Arad died or was killed. Arad disappeared about the time of the 
aggression against Maydun. For example, some of his guards 
might have reacted and killed him in a moment of anger. There 
is no proof of this; I am just trying to explain the riddle. If 
he had returned to Palestine, they would have announced this. 
No one in Palestine has claimed that he is alive or dead. 
There is no reason for anyone to hide him. Therefore, there is 
a high probability that he died or was killed. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The dispute between Hizballah Secretary General 
Hasan Nasrallah and Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah has 
intensified after Nasrallah backed the publication of a book 
entitled Observations on Sayyid Fadlallah's 
Method.The dispute has grown to include their entourages 
and loyalists. Asked about this issue, Fadlallah declared: "I 
do not trust any of Hizballah's leaders... without exception." 
  A dispute has likewise surfaced between Nasrallah and 
Hizballah Consultative Council member Shaykh Muhammad Yazbik, 
who is also director of Hizballah's religious school in 
Ba'labakk. Nasrallah has been giving cover to Shaykh Yazbik's 
rivals. One sign of the dispute was Nasrallah's insistence on 
employing Shaykh As'ad Balluq at the school. Shaykh Yazbik 
insisted on expelling Balluq. 
  Nasrallah realizes that he has lost all his religious 
credentials and his credibility inside Hizballah and is giving 
serious thought to his future after he leaves the secretary 
general's post. He has established and will be director of the 
Islamic Institute for Education, which supervises the Imam Mahdi 
schools in several Lebanese areas. It should be noted that the 
funds that Nasrallah is spending on this institution are 
actually part of Hizballah's budget. He urges Hizballah members 
to be economical and then diverts the party's funds to expand 
his institution. Nasrallah refuses to employ any one in the 
institution who is not blindly loyal and obedient to him. 
  Observers note that military operations carried out by the 
Islamic Resistance have recently been few and feeble. The 
reason is the secretary general's appropriation of funds for his 
own institution. He is also using Hizballah media to make 
publicity for the Imam Mahdi schools. 
  [A brief report on page 9 of the same issue of AL-SHIRA' 
reads: "Recent organizational changes in Hizballah indicate that 
former party secretary general Shaykh Subhi al-Tufayli will 
regain his influence over Hizballah's decisionmaking process."] 
  [AL-SHIRA' also reports on page 10: "The Zionist enemy's 
criminal abduction of the Believers Resistance official Mustafa 
al-Dirani from his house in Qasr Naba provided Hizballah 
Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah with an opportunity to make a 
grand entrance into al-Biqa' following recent negative attitudes 
and resentment against him by area residents and party members. 
Some of his few supporters in the area sought to invent 
occasions for him to attend to give the impression that he is 
still strong in al-Biqa'. The results were disappointing. 
During the al-Ghadir Day poetry festival in Marjat Ra's al-'Ayn 
in Ba'labakk, Nasrallah's loyalists did all they could to 
mobilize a large party turnout but the area's ulema boycotted 
the festival and only 18 out of 100 al-Biqa' scholars attended. 
Hizballah Consultative Council member Shaykh Muhammad Yazbik 
was also absent."]

  [Text] Ba'labakk, Lebanon, June 11 (AFP) -- Two members of 
the Iranian-backed Hizballah tried to kidnap a German woman 
historian in the Syrian-controlled al-Biqa' Valley on Saturday, 
the woman and witnesses said. 
  "It was a bad 10 minutes," Nepta Anngret, 45, a historian 
from Berlin's museum of ethnography, told AFP. 
  She was on her way from her hotel in Ba'labakk to the famous 
Roman ruins of this ancient al-Biqa' Valley town when two young 
men approached her and said: "Hizballah, follow us." 
  "They were very young guys. One was around 16 and the other 
18," Anngret said. 
  "I refused to follow them so one of the youths grabbed my 
arm 
and tried to drag me away. Passersby intervened and escorted me 
back to the Palmyra (hotel) but one of the guys followed me 
there," she said. 
  She said the other young man drove away in a car but quickly 
returned to the hotel to get his friend. 
  Hotel staff and witnesses confirmed the kidnapping attempt. 
  Anngret has been staying at the Palmyra Hotel for a week to 
carry out research at the Roman temples of Ba'labakk. 
  "I've been in Lebanon for a month. People here are very nice 
and I plan on continuing my research before packing up in 10 
days time," she said, stressing that the incident had shaken her 
up but not frightened her. 
  It was the first reported kidnapping attempt of a Westerner 
since the last Western hostage was released in 1991 following a 
wave of abductions during the Lebanese civil war. 
  Hizballah militants seized six Lebanese men and a retired 
Syrian soldier from the Ba'labakk region Wednesday but freed 
them the next morning after the Syrian military command in the 
al-Biqa' threatened to arrest Hizballah militants. 
  The seven were abducted after some of them were seen taking 
photographs outside the home of the former Hizballah secretary 
general al-Shaykh Subhi al-Tufayli. 
  The Iranian-backed guerrillas have been on alert since June 
2 
when Israeli warplanes killed 32 guerrilla trainees on a base 
near Ba'labakk.

  [Text] Tyre, Lebanon, June 11 (AFP)--The Iranian-backed 
Hizballah is planning a major anti-Israeli operation to avenge 
32 trainees killed in an Israeli air raid on June 2, one of its 
leaders warned Saturday. 
  "We are preparing an operation that will surprise the 
world," 
al-Hajj Hasan Huballah told AFP. 
  Israel devastated a Hizballah training base in the 
Syrian-controlled al-Biqa' Valley of eastern Lebanon on June 2, 
killing 32 trainees and prompting retaliatory rocket attacks. 
  Huballah said the Katyusha rockets, which fell harmlessly on 
northern Israel, were not a riposte. 
  He expected further Israeli military operations and 
"assassinations" of Hizballah leaders as part of a US campaign 
to crush opposition to Arab-Israeli peace talks. 
  "We're passing through a very dangerous phase. 
  "There is an American plot aimed at liquidating all those 
who 
oppose the Middle East peace process and Israel has been charged 
with carrying it out," Huballah said. 
  But Hizballah leaders had taken strict measures to preempt 
any attack. "Senior leaders have moved out of their homes, 
changed cars and their daily routine," he said. 
  The air raid came less than two weeks after Israeli airborne 
commandos kidnapped Mustafa al-Dirani, a Muslim guerrilla chief 
with close links to Hizballah, from his home in the al-Biqa'. 
  Israel hopes al-Dirani will supply key information on 
missing 
Israeli airman Ron Arad whose plane was shot down over south 
Lebanon in 1986. 
  Lebanon branded the abduction and the air raid acts of 
piracy 
and protested to the United Nations. It also vowed not to 
disarm Hizballah until Israel dismantled its self-declared 
"security zone" in south Lebanon. 
  The Arabic-language daily AL-HAYAH, quoting Lebanese 
officials, reported Saturday that the United States submitted an 
Israeli warning to the Lebanese authorities. 
  Israel would attack Lebanon if Hizballah carried out its 
threat to launch suicide-operations against Israeli interests 
around the world, according to the report.

  [Text] The General Directorate of Public Security decided 
tonight to stop the Future Television station's transmission due 
to violations of the cabinet decision of 23 March 1994, which 
banned the audio and visual media from transmitting direct or 
indirect political news and programs. 
  Future Television transmitted on its news program "Tonight's 
World" a report on the inauguration of the Sidon municipality 
building. The report included the political speech delivered by 
Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri, thus violating the cabinet 
decision on the transmission of political news.

  [Text] A responsible source today made a statement to SPA 
in which he said: Both AFP and AP reported yesterday [11 June] 
that 'Abd-al-Karim 'Ali al-Iryani, Yemeni minister of planning 
and development, told AFP that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia had 
become a party to the Yemeni conflict and that it was supplying 
the southerners with weapons. 
  The source said: We are not surprised by such completely 
fabricated allegations and lies coming from 'Abd-al-Karim 'Ali 
al-Iryani, whose hostile positions toward the Kingdom have been 
known for a long time, and this is not the first time that 
al-Iryani has violated the truth. In fact, he has made similar 
statements and allusions several times in the past weeks. 
  The source concluded his statement by saying: It is 
noteworthy that the picture conveyed to the custodian of the two 
holy mosques by Mr. Lakhdar Ibrahimi, the current mediator, from 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih is completely different in spirit 
and substance from the statements of al-Iryani to whom, were it 
not for our eagerness to clarify facts about him for public 
opinion, we would not have given any importance.

<F P=106> [Report by Nadim Kawash] </F>
  [Text] Abu Dhabi, June 12 (AFP) -- The French Giat 
Industries is pressing ahead with a major offset weapons deal 
with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and local officials said it 
will reap benefits for their oil-reliant economy. 
  Officials at the Giat Offset in Abu Dhabi said the 
multi-billion- dollar tank deal signed with the UAE last year 
was proceeding without hurdles and several projects would be set 
up in the Gulf state. 
  "There are no problems at all. We are going ahead with the 
deal and there will be several civilian projects here," one 
official said. 
  He declined to elaborate but UAE offset officials said the 
projects covered farming, banking, industry and other sectors. 
They said they would be set up jointly with national investors. 
  Giat won the tank deal after strong competition from US and 
British companies participating in an international defence show 
in Abu Dhabi in 1993. 
  Under the deal, worth between three billion and four billion 
dollars, it will supply 436 Leclerc main battle tanks from the 
start of 1995. 
  Experts said Giat was awarded the contract after it made a 
more attractive offset offer, including investments yielding 
nearly 60 percent of the deal's value. It was the UAE's biggest 
ever offset deal. 
  Giat President Pierre Chiquet said after the deal was signed 
that projects in the UAE would generate more than two billion 
dollars in 10 years and their turnover in the long run could 
exceed the value of contract. 
  Early this year, the semi official daily Emirates News said 
Giat had decided to restructure its offset programmes in the 
UAE, revising some projects and cancelling a contract with the 
French Offset Partners to supervise projects in the UAE because 
of contractual disagreements. 
  "The deal is going smoothly and there is no doubt it will 
have a positive impact on the economy," a UAE offset official 
said. "It will help us in our efforts to obtain technology and 
diversify the economy." 
  Giat has already launched a project under the offset deal, a 
gas- powered central air-conditioning fabrication facility. 
  Quoting Giat sources, the UAE daily Khaleej Times said on 
Sunday the company would soon embark on a project to build a 
residential complex in Abu Dhabi to accommodate Giat offset 
staff and their families. 
  A Giat spokesman refused to comment on the report, which 
said 
the UAE authorities had agreed to allot a plot of land for the 
project. 
  "The project includes 80 villas to house 300 French families 
expected to come to the country from June next year," Khaleej 
Times said. "They will live in the UAE during the entire 
duration of the deal -- 10 years." 
  It said some of them would be assigned to carry out military 
programmes, including training, maintenance and logistic follow 
up while the others will join the offset members already sent to 
oversee civilian projects. 
  France is the UAE's top arms supplier, which has joined 
other 
wealthy Gulf Arab states in bolstering their armed forces 
following the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. 
  Officials said the UAE would likely sign military deals 
worth 
one billion dollars a year until 2000. 
  "They all will be on an offset basis," one official said. "I 
think many companies will be interested because our offset 
programme is flexible." 
  The UAE introduced offset programmes five years ago in a bid 
to attract technology needed for its drive to build an 
industrial base to lessen reliance on unstable oil earnings. 
The programme stipulates that arms suppliers re-invest in 
projects that should yield up to 60 percent of the deal's value.

of the Presidential Council, accompanied by Mr. Sulayman Nasir 
Mas'ud, the member of the Presidential Council, today fulfilled 
the Friday prayers in al-Aydrus Mosque in crater. After the 
prayers, the vice chairman delivered a speech to the 
worshippers. He said: 
  We had tried before entering the authority to rectify the 
matter, and the Arabs and Muslims had also tried their best, but 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih refused. We had only to fight that group 
in order to defend our homeland. The vice chairman indicated to 
the strange decision made by Dr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Daylami last 
Monday [6 June] over Sanaa radio, in which he allowed the 
killing of all of us with our women and children -- not only the 
rulers. He said that his decision included the weak people, and 
we have tape recordings to prove the issue of this decision over 
Sanaa radio. 
  Mr. al-Jifri told the audiences that we have nothing 
remaining except to fight on all battlefronts and here in the 
capital, Aden, in order to refute the false rumors. He said: 
You must know that our sons are fighting on all battlefronts, 
and we must know about their fate.

  [Text] An official source in the Democratic Republic of 
Yemen says that the head of the Sanaa regime has announced that 
he ordered the dispatch of a convoy of food and material 
supplies for the citizens of Aden Governorate. The source 
denounced this announcement, adding that Aden Governorate's 
population is not beggars, and it cannot accept charity from 
those who aggressed on its homeland. The source said that the 
head of the Sanaa regime should rather stop shelling the 
residential quarters and civil establishments in Aden, and 
killing of the elderly, women, and children, in implementation 
of the decision by Dr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Daylami, who allowed 
the killing of women, the elderly, and children. 
  He added that such a decision is not approved by religion, 
morals, or human rights. Aden is also inaccessible, and it is 
not in need of the charity of those who try to destroy it. He 
should rather lift the injustice, corruption, and hegemony from 
our brothers in the north, who are fighting to get rid of his 
regime. 
  The source expressed regret and sadness that a people like 
those in the north remain under the rule of such people, who try 
to destroy everything in democratic Yemen, and try to prevent 
water from reaching Aden, and destroy the electricity station 
and Aden's international airport and vital establishments, and 
set its refinery on fire -- though 30,000 persons depend on it 
for their living. They also threatened to prevent navigation in 
the Gulf of Aden, which receives foodstuffs and medicines. Then 
there may be a claim that they will send medicine and food for 
Aden's population. [sentence as heard]

  [Text] In an interview with the BBC, Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim 
al-Iryani, minister of planning and development, has asserted 
that our country is strictly adhering to the cease-fire. 
  He said: We continued to watch the situation from 1800 
yesterday until midnight, and all positions in Aden Governorate 
were sending successive cables saying that the rebels had not 
stop their artillery shelling. 
  He said: Our country has informed the United Nations of 
this, and reaffirmed that we are continuing to adhere to the 
cease-fire in spite of the continuous shelling of the Armed 
Forces' positions by the rebels. 
  Dr. al-Iryani expressed the belief that the rebels and those 
who support them have no interest in the cease-fire because 
their objective is to summon foreign forces onto Yemeni land. 
He said: They do not have any consideration for Yemeni 
sovereignty. He added: The objective of the rebels is 
unreasonable and illogical, and shows no respect for the 
homeland's sovereignty. As for our position, the cease-fire is 
our only concern. 
  Answering a question on reports that the Gulf states intend 
to recognize the rebels, al-Iryani replied by saying: This will 
be considered a continuation of aggression against the 
sovereignty, unity, and safety of Yemen, and an attempt to 
perpetuate the shedding of Yemeni blood.

of yesterday's cease-fire agreement. He stressed that the 
conflict can be solved through dialogue between the concerned 
parties, but such a dialogue is still not possible as the south 
wants a complete halt to battles and full northern commitment to 
a cease-fire before anything else. As for the conditions of the 
north, here is 'Abd-al-Salam al-'Ansi, chairman of the General 
Committee of the General People's Congress, which is led by 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, speaking to our correspondent 
Ahmad Birru in Sanaa. 
  [Begin al-Anisi recording] To agree to dialogue, the 
following conditions should be met: 
  1. The Socialist Party should issue a decision abrogating 
the secession decision. 
  2. It should clearly and frankly announce its acceptance 
of the results of the parliamentary elections held on 27 April 
[1993]. 
  3. It should announce its commitment to the 
constitutional legitimacy and to dealing with the institutions 
accordingly. 
  4. The dialogue should take place in Sanaa. 
  5. The dialogue should not last more than five days. 
  6. The 16 Socialist Party members subpoenaed by the 
public prosecutor should not take part in the dialogue. [end

  [Text] Informed military sources have unmasked the ruling 
military regime in Sanaa by finding out that it has never been 
serious at any time in observing the cease-fire declared by the 
head of the regime following his meeting with Lakhdar Brahimi, 
the special envoy of the UN secretary general. 
  The military sources reported that the northern commander of 
the military axis in Ta'izz had asked the northern units on the 
battlefronts to send a military crew to collect a cable which he 
described as extremely important. The sources confirmed the 
arrival of this cable to the fighting areas at 1730 today. It 
has become clear that the cable contains orders that the war 
operations are to continue and that the cease-fire is to be 
ignored. 
  Meanwhile, the sources have reported that the Popular 
Resistance in the (Amlin) center in al-Dali' Province repulsed 
an infiltration attempt by a gang of the regular forces of the 
military ruling regime in Sanaa two days ago [8th June]. The 
Popular Resistance succeeded in defeating the gang and forced it 
into retreat after destroying two military crews and capturing a 
large lorry carrying military supplies and ammunition belonging 
to the forces of the military regime in Sanaa. Meanwhile, the 
Popular Resistance is gaining strength in the various areas in 
driving out the aggressive invaders.

<F P=106> [Report by Laurence Peter] </F>
  [Text] Sanaa, June 10 (AFP) -- Yemen's northern President 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih on Friday called for a new ceasefire in the 
five-week civil war and proposed ways to make it stick this 
time, an official spokesman said here. 
  His government presented the United Nations with a proposal 
for the ceasefire to take effect at midnight on Friday (2100 
GMT) in compliance with UN Security Council resolution 924 
adopted last week, he said. 
  Salih told members of a special military committee to 
"supervise the ceasefire by holding the first meeting at a place 
called Gool," between Sabir and Dayr al-Sayyid villages at 11 
a.m. (0800 GMT) on Saturday, the spokesman said. 
  Sabir is along the front line about 25 kilometers (15 miles) 
north of the southern stronghold of Aden. 
  The military committee of southern and northern officers was 
formed under a February accord reached in Jordan and aimed at 
ending a political crisis between the north and south. But the 
crisis erupted into civil war on May 5. 
  The new proposal came after Salih agreed to a ceasefire 
during talks Thursday with UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, but which 
collapsed around three hours later. A ceasefire for midnight on 
Monday also broke down hours later. 
  Both sides have accused the other of failing to honor the 
pledge to stop fighting. 
  There was no immediate word from the south on the "new 
initiative." 
  Sanaa has "put forward a new initiative confirming its 
keenness to maintain a ceasefire based on UN resolution 924, 
despite successive ceasefire violations by the dissidents since 
6 p.m. Thursday," the spokesman said in the statement. 
  Salih describes as dissidents the forces loyal to his 
southern rival and former vice president 'Ali Salim al-Bid, who 
declared a separate state with Aden as its capital on May 21. 
  "These violations are still continuing up to this moment," 
the spokesman charged. 
  "Although the government forces have abided by orders of 
President Salih not to return fire, the dissident forces have 
continued their violations by launching heavy air and sea 
attacks on government forces in Aden and Abyan, inflicting heavy 
casualties and damage," he said. 
  "The Yemeni government told its permanent representative at 
the United Nations to keep the UN Secretary General (Butrus 
Butrus- Ghali) well informed about all these violations," he 
said. 
  It also told its representative to "submit new ceasefire 
initiatives provided the dissidents abide by it with effect from 
12 midnight on Friday in order not to give the dissidents a 
chance to continue shedding Yemeni blood and executing their 
criminal plans," he said. 
  Brahimi left the northern capital Sanaa earlier on Friday, 
saying he was "disappointed" that Thursday's ceasefire had 
collapsed but that he had still made a good start. 
  He was due in Saudi Arabia for talks with Saudi officials 
about the conflict. Southern sources said he will meet with 
al-Bid and other officials in the southeastern port of Mukalla.

Party [YSP] and its Political Bureau announce the death of the 
brother struggler Qa'id 'Ali Muhammad Salah, Central Committee 
member, first secretary of the party's organization in Lahij

  [Text] Brother Ambassador 'Abdallah al-Ashtal, our 
country's permanent representative to the United Nations, has 
presented a message to UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali including a new initiative by brother Lieutenant 
General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential 
Council and supreme commander of the Armed Forces. The message 
states the following: 
  The Republic of Yemen emphasizes its concern to observe a 
cease- fire in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 
No. 924. This is despite the secessionist rebels' repeated 
flagrant cease- fire violations since 1800 on 9 June--the date 
set by brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
Presidential Council chairman and supreme commander of the Armed 
Forces, after his meeting with Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN secretary 
general's envoy. These violations were still continuing up to 
the time this message was drafted. Although the forces of 
legitimacy and unity complied with the the Armed Forces supreme 
commander's order not to respond to those violations, the 
apostate and secessionist elements persisted in their cease-fire 
violations, intensifying their air and naval bombardment of our 
forces in Aden and Abyan governorates, resulting in material and 
human losses among their ranks. Despite all that, the 
Government of the Republic of Yemen has instructed the permanent 
representative to inform the UN secretary general of all those 
violations and to submit a new initiative, on condition that the 
rebels abide by the cease-fire as of midnight last night, 
Friday, 10 June. Out of the Government of the Republic of 
Yemen's concern not to allow the apostate and secessionist 
elements to continue the letting of Yemeni blood within their 
criminal scheme, the brother chairman of the Presidential 
Council has instructed members of the Yemeni military committee, 
which had been set up by a decision by the chairman of the 
Presidential Council and supreme commander of the Armed Forces, 
to supervise the cease-fire by holding its first meeting in a 
specific place named (Ja'ulah), located between Sabir and Dar 
Sa'd villages, at 1100 today, Saturday, 11 June.

  [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 11 (AFP)--Fierce artillery duels 
erupted near the southern stronghold of Aden on Saturday 
breaking the latest ceasefire in Yemen's five-week-old civil war. 
  Explosions could be heard from the centre of Aden marking an 
end to a lull in fighting after the ceasefire called by the 
north came into force at midnight (2100 GMT) Friday. 
  A southern spokesman also accused the north of launching an 
air raid Saturday on the Aden oil refinery but said the 
warplanes missed their target. 
  The refinery, some 15 kilometres (nine miles) west of Aden, 
was hit earlier in the week in northern air raids, and six oil 
storage tanks were set ablaze. 
  Earlier, northern army units loyal to President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih halted their bombardment of Aden and nearby 
villages, an AFP correspondent in the city said. 
  Jumhuriyah hospital in Aden, where the fighting has cut off 
drinking water supplies to the 500,000 residents, reported no 
new casualties since the ceasefire. 
  The government in Sanaa proposed a joint military commission 
to supervise the ceasefire but southern leaders insisted on 
international observers. 
  "The joint military commission formed at the time of unity 
no 
longer exists," said the southern leadership, which declared a 
breakaway Yemen Democratic Republic on May 21.

  [Text] Sanaa, 11 Jun (MENA)--Yemeni Planning Minister Dr. 
'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani has said that what he described as "the 
forces of apostasy and secession" have rejected the new 
initiative by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih to stabilize the 
cease-fire in Yemen; the proposal would have gone into effect at 
1800 yesterday. In a statement to a MENA correspondent in Sanaa 
he said that the "rebels" are continuing to fight with all types 
of weapons. He stressed that the "the forces of unity and 
legitimacy have completely abided by the cease-fire." He said 
that the "rebels" had refused to attend the Yemeni Military 
Committee meeting in the (Ja'walah) area, between the villages 
of Sabir and Darb al-'Amr near Aden, which had been scheduled 
for 1100 Saturday morning.

  [Text] Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, chairman of the 
Presidential Council, met this morning brothers Haydar Abu-Bakr 
al-'Attas, the chairman of the Council of Ministers; 'Abdallah 
'Abd-al-Majid al- Asnaj, deputy premier and foreign minister; 
Muhsin Abu-Bakr Bin Farid, deputy premier and minister of 
planning and development; and Salih Ubayd Ahmad, minister of 
transport and communications. 
  The prime minister briefed his brother the chairman of the 
Presidential Council on the outcome of the tours made by him and 
his deputies to Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates 
[UAE] and Kuwait as well as on his meetings with the leaders of 
those countries and their briefings on the latest developments 
in the Yemeni crisis and the war imposed on our Yemeni people by 
the gang of the bloody al-Ahmar family. 
  Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid welcomed the patriotic personality 
of al-Ustadh 'Abdallah 'Abd-al-Majid al-Asnaj who returned to 
the homeland to participate with his brothers in building the 
Democratic Republic of Yemen, a new modern state, a state of law 
and order. The brother chairman of the Presidential Council 
expressed his satisfaction about the outcome of the tours made 
and praised the stand of those countries and their leaders on 
the side of the cause of our Yemeni people as well as their 
efforts at the Arab and international levels to stop this 
destructive war which causes concern for the security and 
stability of Yemen and the region. Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid 
reiterated the unilateral and strict commitment of the 
Democratic Republic of Yemen to the decision of the UN Security 
Council Resolution No. 924 on the cease-fire. 
  He stressed that all efforts must be concerted to implement 
the Security Council resolution and to compel the Sanaa military 
regime, which is challenging international legitimacy and is 
violating the council's resolution, to abide by the cease-fire 
resolution, stop the war and resort to peaceful dialogue to 
tackle the political situation.

  [Text] A responsible military source at the Ministry of 
Defense of the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY] has made the 
following statement to the Yemeni News Agency, Aden: 
  The forces of the ruling military regime in Sanaa resumed 
this morning, Saturday [11 June], their desperate attempts to 
advance toward the Governorate of Aden from different fronts. 
Artillery and missile attacks continued on the residential 
quarters in the approaches to Aden. A number of aircraft 
attempted to strike Aden refinery but our air defenses 
intercepted them. The air raid of the hostile forces failed to 
achieve their objective. 
  All this is taking place in spite of the so-called new 
initiative put forward by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih through his 
representative at the United Nations in which he claimed his 
wish for a cease-fire. This indicates that the ruling military 
regime in Sanaa is continuing its political and media game to 
deceive the Arab and international public opinion while at the 
same time it is continuing its desperate attempts to storm Aden. 
This is a dream in the mind of that regime under its head who 
is arrogant and blood-thirsty. This objective is impossible to 
achieve. The Armed Forces of the DRY supported by thousands of 
our people who have enlisted in their ranks have taken the 
responsibility of defending the DRY and its sovereignty, and 
will never allow the new invading aggressors to continue 
inflicting their folly and recklessness against the lives and 
possessions of our people. Defeat is awaiting the aggressors 
and victory is near, God willing.

  [Text] Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
Presidential Council chairman and commander in chief of the 
Armed Forces, today visited the Dhamar Governorate. He was 
greeted by brother officials and a number of the governorates's 
shaykhs, notables, and community leaders. 
  The brother president visited al-Quds Camp in Dhamar and 
Dhafar Camp in [word indistinct]. He was received by the 
brother commanders of the two camps, officers, non-commissioned 
officers [NCO's], and the ranks. They expressed their gladness 
over the brother president's visit to familiarize himself with 
their conditions. They stated their high state of preparedness 
to fulfill their patriotic duty and to make sacrifices in the 
cause of defending the homeland and its unity and its gains and 
democratic, developmental, and other achievements and 
confronting the gang of rebellion and secession that has sought 
to destroy and tear up the homeland. They emphasized that 
Yemeni unity lives in the heart and conscience of every worthy 
citizen. The Yemeni unity, they emphasized, is the culmination 
of the fight of strugglers and the sacrifices of our people's 
martyrs and their Armed Forces. They stressed that all 
sacrifices are nothing when made for the sake of the homeland. 
They noted the depth of their loyalty to God, the homeland, the 
revolution, and unity, and their support for our patriotic 
leadership under brother 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, who has shown 
himself to be a unionist leader dedicated to the nationalist 
principles and the causes of the homeland and its unity. 
  The brother chairman of the presidential council, commander 
in chief of the Armed Forces, spoke to the brother officers and 
NCO's and ranks of the Armed and Security Forces. He paid 
tribute to their high morale and the heroic performance of the 
Armed and Security Forces who have proved loyal to principles 
and who have kept their promise to God. They were truly the 
soldiers of right, revolution, and unity, who have rallied to 
the will of their people at all times and written bright pages 
of acts of heroism in defense of our people's right to a free 
and decent life. He indicated the challenges the homeland is 
having to tackle following the actions taken by the gang of 
rebellion and secession. President Salih reviewed this gang's 
diabolical scheme through which it has sought to tear apart the 
homeland's unity, which was forged on 22 May 1990 as a fruit of 
a long struggle and (?unique) sacrifices. The gang, he said, 
has forced this war on the homeland with the aim of destroying 
it and set out to ignite sedition among the sons of the one 
homeland to gratify their destructive selfishness and to serve 
their own ends, indifferent to [word indistinct] the chaste 
Yemeni blood that has been spilled. The brother president noted 
the devastation this has caused to the homeland. 
  All conspiracies targeting unity and democracy have crashed 
and will crash on the rock of the steadfastness and awareness 
and strong will of our people and their Armed Forces, the 
president said. He noted the gang of rebellion and secession's 
cease-fire violations committed within the context of their 
defiance of the will of the international community. This 
separatist, rebellious gang in the [Yemeni] Socialist Party, 
lacking all values and betraying all principles and covenants, 
has had no qualms about perpetrating the ugliest crimes against 
the homeland and the people. The gang is continually violating 
the cease-fire and flouting the UN Security Council resolution. 
We would like to reiterate here, added the brother president, 
that if this murderous gang will not be bound by the cease-fire 
resolution and continues to breach it -- it is the fourth 
opportunity this gang has been given to abide by the resolution 
-- the forces of unity and legitimacy are going to force it into 
respecting and abiding by it. 
  The brother commander in chief of the Armed Forces 
reiterated 
our country's commitment to all the clauses of the Security 
Council resolution. He stressed that our valiant Armed Forces 
continue to be fully observant of the cease-fire resolution 
despite the recurring acts of aggression on their positions by 
elements of this rebellious gang, which is in its last gasps of 
breath [word indistinct] destruction of all vital economic 
installations before its departure, including the Aden refinery 
and the electricity plant at [word indistinct] and other 
facilities as an act of revenge on the homeland and an 
expression of hatred for the Yemeni people and their 
achievements. 
  The brother president applauded acts of heroism by members 
of 
our valiant Armed Forces, who spearheaded the battle of honor 
and dignity for the homeland and people in the cause of unity, 
democracy, and constitutional legality. They have proved 
valiant heroes fearless of death in that they are fighting the 
cause of right against wrong. They are also fighting for the 
great principles and achievements that our people have fought 
for -- unity and democracy, above all. He exhorted the brother 
heroic officers and NCO's of the Armed and Security Forces to 
show increased vigilance and awareness and to be prepared to 
fulfill their patriotic duty. A great people stand behind you 
[words indistinct] your generosity and sacrifices so that the 
banner of Yemeni unity stays hoisted over the [word indistinct] 
Yemeni homeland. Unity means pride, dignity, glory, and 
stability. No matter what the cost and the sacrifices our 
people and our Armed Forces may have to make, there can be no 
abandonment of unity. There is no future for Yemen without 
unity, asserted the brother president.

legitimacy will have to defend themselves. Brother 
'Abd-al-Ghani said the Republic of Yemen welcomes the mission of 
Lakhdar Brahimi, based on its acceptance of the UN Security 
council resolution on the situation in Yemen. 
  Asked about acceptance of the resolution, brother 
'Abd-al-Ghani said we [words indistinct] dialogue and we have 
borne [words indistinct] its [word indistinct] for nine [words

unity. But the separatist rebels were not serious and [words

with unionists within the [Yemeni] Socialist Party [YSP], not 
with those who proclaimed secession. Our dialogue with the 
unionists will be within the context of the Republic of Yemen 
and Constitutional legality, considering that the YSP is a 
patriotic party that has a presence throughout the republic's 
governorates. There are many top officials of the YSP in the 
Central Committee and in the House of Representatives, as well 
as party branch chiefs in the governorates who condemned the 
action taken by secessionists in the YSP.

  [Text] Staff Brigadier General brother 'Abd-al-Malik al- 
Sayyani, chief of the General Staff has emphasized that our 
Armed Forces -- the forces of unity and legitimacy -- have been 
fully observing the cease-fire resolution decision made by 
Lieutenant General brother 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the 
President Council and commander in chief of the Armed Forces, 
following his meeting with brother Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN 
secretary general's envoy. He indicated the government's 
response to the UN Security Council Resolution 924 on the 
situation in the Republic of Yemen and [word indistinct] and its 
compliance with all its clauses. In contrast, he added, the 
gang of rebellion and secession in the [Yemeni] Socialist Party 
leadership [words indistinct] international legitimacy the way 
it has engaged in crime and rebelliousness against national 
legitimacy and standing against national unity and consensus. 
  In statements published by the newspaper 26 SEPTEMBER today, 
he said our valiant Armed Forces will remain bound by the 
cease-fire resolution even if the treasonous separatists breach 
it and no matter what their flimsy pretexts to invite outside 
interference in their attempt to internationalize the Yemeni 
crisis. What is taking place in our country, he emphasized, is 
a domestic affair, which the forces of unity and legitimacy have 
managed to contain. They have also succeeded in defeating the 
rebellious elements. 
  He indicated that the great (?role) of the forces of unity 
and legitimacy to stand up to the gang of apostasy and secession 
has been reinforced by the remarkable popular cohesion shown by 
all our people's sectors [words indistinct] to stand behind the 
fighters in the battle for unity and democracy against the 
enemies of the Yemeni people and homeland. The Armed Forces 
that have defended the revolution and its gains are more capable 
[words indistinct] and aborting all conspiratorial attempts 
against it.

  [Text] Sanaa today publicly and directly accused Saudi 
Arabia of involvement in the Yemeni war by helping the 
southerners and providing weapons to them, deeming Saudi Arabia 
a party to the dispute, as Yemeni Minister of Planning and 
Environment 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani put it. 
  The northern minister said Saudi Arabia is supplying the 
south with weapons it is purchasing from certain eastern 
European nations, such as the Ukraine, Bulgaria, Hungary, and 
Poland via al-Mukalla Port, where southern leader 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid is staying. 
  Al-Iryani said the Sanaa Government has conclusive evidence 
that al-Bid is being supplied with weapons -- which he described 
as limitless -- from Saudi Arabia. 
  The Gulf Cooperation Council states, except for Qatar, have 
implicitly recognized the Democratic Republic of Yemen 
proclaimed by al-Bid two weeks after the eruption of battles. 
  The northern official also revealed that the contacts made 
by 
Sanaa with some of the leaders of the Yemeni Socialist Party 
[YSP] in the south have failed. This shows, in his opinion, 
that the politicians in the south no longer have any influence 
on military affairs. He added that Lakhdar Brahimi, the special 
envoy of the UN secretary general, did not propose anything new 
in his talks with officials in Sanaa and was satisfied with the 
suggestions made in the international resolution on Yemen. 
However, Sayf Sa'il, member of the YSP Political Bureau, said 
in Aden that he was optimistic about Brahimi's efforts, saying 
the main purpose of the mission is to enact a cease-fire because 
negotiations can never achieve anything as long as there is no 
cease-fire. 
  The two parties are still divided over how to monitor the 
cease- fire. The northerners want a joint military committee to 
be formed. The southerners, however, insist on deploying 
international observers. This prompted al-Iryani to say that 
the southerners want to internationalize the crisis. 
  Northern Yemeni Justice Minister 'Abdallah Ghanim said the 
southerners' demand for international disengagement troops is 
open aggression against Yemen's sovereignty and independence. 
Ghanim cast doubt on the credibility of the United Nations, 
which, he said, uses double standards and adopts its resolutions 
without heeding the right of peoples and countries to bar 
interference in their internal affairs. Ghanim said there are 
parties that support the position of the rebels. He said: We 
find it strange for these parties to offer such support and we 
ask them to stop it because it leads to more bloodshed, as he 
said.

  [Text] Our correspondent in Yemen, Ahmad Birru, has met 
with 'Abd-al-Qadir Ba Jammal, the Yemeni deputy prime minister, 
and asked him about the conditions set for dialogue with the 
southern leaders and his stand on the neighboring Gulf states, 
which implicitly supported the establishment of the Yemeni 
Democratic Republic in south Yemen. 
  [Begin recording] [Ba Jammal] We have laid down what we 
might 
call the principles of dialogue, the principles and bases of 
dialogue. These are nine principles [as heard]. We announced 
them and handed them officially to Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi. First 
of all, there is unity, the constitutional legitimacy, and the 
cancellation of the secessionist decisions. Then there is the 
unity of the Army--what remains of the Armed Forces and the 
vehicles and equipment should join and be restored to the 
legitimate forces. Also, the dialogue must be in Sanaa and be 
fixed at five days, and no third party should be involved in the 
dialogue. 
  [Birru] You said that the war was designed and produced 
abroad. Can you give as tangible proof of this interference? 
  [Ba Jammal] In fact we have many complaints against certain 
states in the region; that is, the Arabian Peninsula. 
Regrettably, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia always speaks much 
about Yemenis, its love for the Yemenis, and the stability of 
Yemen but regrettably the facts are the opposite of this. 
  [Birru] Have there been any contacts between Yemen and these 
neighboring states so they can change their stand toward...? 
  [Ba Jammal, interrupting] We appeal to the Arab and Muslim 
brothers in Saudi Arabia, for the sake of our neighboring 
relations and for the sake of humanity, to leave Yemen alone.

<F P=106> [Report by Lutfi Shatarah] </F>
  [Text] London -- 'Abdallah al-Asnaj, foreign minister of 
the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY], has accused Jordan of 
involvement in the ongoing fighting in Yemen alongside the 
forces loyal to the Sanaa leadership. He told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT 
over the telephone from Abu Dhabi that 30 Jordanian military air 
engineers are equipping Northern U.S.-made F-5 fighter aircraft 
with spare parts -- "which has helped to restore their 
combat-readiness, thus enabling them to participate in recent 
battles." 
  Al-Asnaj said that "the DRY authorities are investigating 
this involvement with the Jordanian quarters concerned and with 
a number of Arab states, on the grounds that this involvement is 
one of the factors contributing to escalating the war." 
  It is worth mentioning that a high-ranking Western 
diplomatic 
source, who asked to remain anonymous, told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT 
that "some reports say that Yemen is obtaining arms from 
Russia." The sources added that "Jordan may be the channel 
through which the arms are imported for Sanaa." 
  Al-Asnaj pointed out that Northern aircraft, which have 
resumed their attacks recently, "are bombing civilian targets in 
the Aden suburbs." He stressed that "the DRY will cooperate 
with any measures taken by the Security Council to secure a 
cease-fire, and may apply to the Council again if [UN secretary 
general's envoy Lakhdar] Brahimi's mission fails."

  [Excerpts] Sanaa, June 11 (AFP) -- Northern warplanes 
Saturday bombed the airport in the city where southern leader 
'Ali Salim al- Bid is based, a military spokesman said here 
after a third ceasefire in Yemen's civil war collapsed. 
  The attack on al-Mukalla, the first air raid on an airport 
to 
be announced by Sanaa since war broke out five weeks ago, 
"caused heavy damage to the airport and warplanes" based there, 
the spokesman said without elaborating. 
  There was no immediate confirmation of the raid which came 
hours before southern officials expected UN peace envoy Lakhdar 
Brahimi to hold talks with al-Bid in al-Mukalla. 
  Yemen's northern President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih called a 
second ceasefire for Thursday during talks with Brahimi in 
Sanaa, and then declared another truce for midnight Friday. 
  All ceasefires, including one declared here on Monday, have 
collapsed with north and south blaming each other. 
  Northern artillery meanwhile fired about six shells that 
landed near the airport in Aden, 300 kilometers (180 miles) to 
the west of al-Mukalla, and other neighborhoods, starting fires 
and damaging homes, southern officials said. 
  Officials at the Al-Jumhuriyah hospital said 18 civilians 
were wounded. 
  Explosions could be seen and heard from the center of Aden 
as 
rival forces fought artillery duels about 20 kilometers (12 
miles) away -- evidence of the collapse of the ceasefire called 
by the north for midnight (2100 GMT) Friday. 
  Southern officials said that northern warplanes also tried 
to 
hit the refinery in Little Aden. 
  Aid workers said offices of an Athens-based company working 
at the refinery, the Consolidated Contractors Company, was hit 
and set ablaze, but there were no casualties as the offices were 
empty. 
  The refinery, some 15 kilometres (nine miles) west of Aden 
and vital for the south's armed forces, was hit last Sunday in 
northern air raids, and six oil storage tanks were set ablaze. 
  Earlier, northern army units had halted their bombardment of 
Aden and nearby villages, an AFP correspondent in the city said. 
  Running water was restored to some neighborhoods after 
repairs were made to part of the pumping station that was 
shelled last week, city officials said. [passage omitted] 
  Southern officials said on Aden television late Friday that 
they had recaptured almost all of the eastern oil-producing 
Shabwah province from northern forces after several days of 
heavy fighting. 
  UN special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, meanwhile, arrived 
Saturday 
in the Saudi city of Jeddah from Amman after holding talks 
earlier this week in Sanaa as part of a peace mission. He also 
aims to meet southern leaders. 
  In Sanaa, a government official met with a UN mission 
seeking 
to organize relief for victims of the war, the official northern 
news agency SABA' said. 
  In Geneva, the International Committee of the Red Cross said 
one of its ships was waiting off Aden for safety guarantees 
before unloading emergency medical supplies for war wounded.

<F P=106> [Report by Maher Chmaytelli] </F>
  [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 12 (AFP) -- Northern Yemeni 
gunners opened fire on the breakaway southern Yemeni capital 
Aden Saturday, killing two people and wounding 22, the 
al-Jumhuriyah Hospital reported. 
  Shells continued to fall sporadically on the city centre 
Saturday evening [11 June], causing fires and destroying several 
houses, after a third ceasefire in Yemen's five-week-old civil 
war collapsed. 
  The worst-hit areas were Khormaksar near the airport, 
Mansurah and Ma'allah. 
  A northern spokesman earlier Saturday announced that north 
Yemen planes attacked the airport in al-Mukalla -- where rebel 
southern leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid has his headquarters -- and 
"caused heavy damage." 
  Al-Mukalla is located 700 kilometers (400 miles) east of 
Aden. 
  In the Ma'allah district here meanwhile a bomb exploded 
under 
a car, wounding three. Southern officials said the "sabotage" 
had been carried out by "elements of the Jihad fundamentalist 
movement, who are trying to destabilise the city." 
  Explosions could be seen and heard from the center of Aden 
as 
rival forces fought artillery duels about 20 kilometers (12 
miles) away. 
  The north had declared a ceasefire to take effect midnight 
Friday, proposing a joint military commission to supervise the 
truce. But southern leaders insisted on international 
observers, a proposal already ruled out by the north. 
  The south nonetheless vowed to observe the ceasefire and to 
"act only defensively," but violent artillery duels around Aden 
continued throughout Saturday. 
  Two other ceasefires have been broken after only a few hours 
this week, with north and south blaming each other. 
  South Yemen proclaimed itself independent on May 21, four 
years after North and South Yemen had merged to form a fragile 
union and weeks after fighting broke out between the two sides. 
  Political leaders in the unified state, at odds 
ideologically, had never been able to agree on the 
administration of the country. 
  There was no immediate confirmation of the airport attack, 
which came hours before southern officials had expected UN peace 
envoy Lakhdar Brahimi to hold talks with al-Bid in al-Mukalla. 
  Brahimi met earlier with King Fahd of Saudi Arabia in Jeddah 
and with the northern Yemen president, 'Ali Abdallah Salih in 
Sanaa to promote support for UN Security Council resolution 924 
calling for an immediate ceasefire and political dialogue. 
  The north has accused Saudi Arabia of supplying the south 
with arms from eastern Europe. 
  Here in Aden, running water was restored to some 
neighborhoods after repairs were made to part of a pumping 
station shelled last week, city officials said. 
  But electricity is still being rationed and occasional power 
cuts have plagued the city since its power station was hit 
Friday. 
  A member of the ruling southern Yemen Socialist Party 
council, Sa'ib Sa'il, said two standby stations had been put in 
service to guarantee power supplies. 
  In Geneva, the International Committee of the Red Cross 
announced that one of its ships was waiting off Aden for safety 
guarantees before unloading emergency medical supplies for the 
wounded. 
  A Red Cross official told journalists in Aden Saturday that 
nearly 2,000 soldiers and civilians were being held in detention 
in north and south Yemen because of the civil war, which he had 
left thousands dead and wounded.

  [Text] A responsible source has stated the following: 
  The Government of the Republic of Yemen has stressed its 
sincere commitment to UN Security Council Resolution 924. To 
this end, brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
Presidential Council chairman and supreme commander of the Armed 
Forces, issued repeated instructions to the forces of legitimacy 
and unity to abide by the cease-fire, and he set specific hours 
for that. The latest decision in this regard was conveyed to 
brother Lakhdar Brahimi, representative of the UN secretary 
general, who expressed appreciation for this new attempt and 
hoped that it would be complied with. However, the apostate and 
secessionist gang deliberately and premeditatedly insisted on 
aborting all those decisions in the hope that it would be able 
to peddle its criminal scheme against the homeland. 
  To put an end to this gang's plotting and treason, and out 
of 
concern to enable brother Lakhdar Brahimi to fulfill his mission 
successfully, the brother chairman of the Presidential Council 
and supreme commander of the Armed Forces set a new date for the 
apostate and secessionist gang to comply with the cease-fire, 
starting Friday midnight, 10 June. That decision was 
accompanied by the new initiative of entrusting the Yemeni 
military officers of the military committee, which had been set 
up by a decision of the supreme commander of the Armed Forces, 
with the mission of supervising the cease-fire. The committee 
had been slated to meet at 1100 yesterday, Saturday, 11 June. 
Although the mischievous secessionists' knew that that 
initiative and new date for their compliance with the cease-fire 
was conveyed to the United Nations, the permanent UN Security 
Council member states, the Gulf Cooperation Council states, and 
the Arab League, they persisted in their arrogance, exposing 
their ill intentions, of which we had been aware. Thus, they 
violated the UN Security Council resolution, hoping they would 
able to continue their plotting against the homeland's unity and 
safety. In this context, they have been continuing their 
ground, naval, and air bombardment of the positions of the 
forces of legitimacy and unity in the Aden Governorate up to the 
time this statement was drafted. 
  Persisting in defying the will of the Yemeni people and 
international legitimacy, the elements of apostasy and secession 
declared rejection of the military committee's supervision of 
the cease-fire implementation. They demanded that international 
forces be sent to the homeland. The Government of the Republic 
stresses that this is merely a new attempt to violate the 
homeland's sovereignty and independence, and that that demand 
has exposed premeditated intentions against UN Security Council 
Resolution 924. They want to abort the basic element of that 
resolution, which is ceasing fire in preparation for holding a 
dialogue. The Government of the Republic of Yemen has informed 
the UN envoy of its absolute readiness to start a dialogue 
immediately. However, the apostate and secessionist elements' 
ill intentions have been proved by the fact that they have 
demanded that international forces be brought in. 
  Concluding his statement, the source said: The criminal, 
conspiratorial schemes concocted by the plotting and agent gang 
will be confronted. This gang's continued cease-fire 
violations, which aim to achieve treasonous objectives, will be 
confronted firmly and forcefully. This gang must bear the 
consequences of its conspiracy. Seeking to dismember the 
homeland and shed the Yemeni people's chaste blood, this 
conspiracy proves this gang's treason and subservience. And 
soon will the unjust assailants know what vicissitudes their 
affairs will take [Koranic verse].

  [Text] Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
Presidential Council chairman and commander in chief of the 
Armed Forces, yesterday visited the Dhamar Governorate. He was 
greeted by brother officials and a number of the governorates' 
shaykhs, notables, and community leaders. 
  The brother president visited al-Fatah Camp in Dhamar and 
Dhafar Camp in Yarim. He was received by the brother commanders 
of the two camps, officers, non-commissioned officers [NCO's], 
and the ranks. They expressed their gladness over the brother 
president's visit to familiarize himself with their conditions. 
They stated their high state of preparedness to fulfill their 
patriotic duty and to make sacrifices in the cause of defending 
the homeland and its unity and its gains and democratic, 
developmental, and other achievements and confronting the gang 
of rebellion and secession that has sought to destroy and tear 
up the homeland. They emphasized that Yemeni unity lives in the 
heart and conscience of every worthy citizen. The Yemeni unity, 
they emphasized, is the culmination of the fight of strugglers 
and the sacrifices of our people's martyrs and their Armed 
Forces. They stressed that all sacrifices are nothing when made 
for the sake of the homeland. They noted the depth of their 
loyalty to God, the homeland, the revolution, and unity, and 
their support for our patriotic leadership under brother 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih, who has shown himself to be a unionist leader 
dedicated to the nationalist principles and the causes of the 
homeland and its unity. 
  The brother chairman of the presidential council, commander 
in chief of the Armed Forces, spoke to the brother officers and 
NCO's and ranks of the Armed and Security Forces. He paid 
tribute to their high morale and the heroic performance of the 
Armed and Security Forces who have proved loyal to principles 
and who have kept their promise to God. They were truly the 
soldiers of right, revolution, and unity, who have rallied to 
the will of their people at all times and written bright pages 
of acts of heroism in defense of our people's right to a free 
and decent life. He indicated the challenges the homeland is 
having to tackle following the actions taken by the gang of 
rebellion and secession. President Salih reviewed this gang's 
diabolical scheme through which it has sought to tear apart the 
homeland's unity, which was forged on 22 May 1990 as a fruit of 
a long struggle and dear sacrifices. The gang, he said, has 
forced this war on the homeland with the aim of destroying it 
and set out to ignite sedition among the sons of the one 
homeland to gratify their destructive selfishness and to serve 
their own ends, indifferent to sacrifices and to the chaste 
Yemeni blood that has been spilled. The brother president noted 
the devastation this has caused to the homeland. 
  All conspiracies targeting unity and democracy have crashed 
and will crash on the rock of the steadfastness and awareness 
and strong will of our people and their Armed Forces, the 
president said. He noted the gang of rebellion and secession's 
cease-fire violations committed within the context of their 
defiance of the will of the international community. This 
separatist, rebellious gang in the [Yemeni] Socialist Party, 
lacking all values and betraying all principles and covenants, 
has had no qualms about perpetrating the ugliest crimes against 
the homeland and the people and about disregarding all values, 
principles, and norms. The gang is continually violating the 
cease-fire and flouting the UN Security Council resolution. We 
would like to reiterate here, added the brother president, that 
if this murderous gang will not be bound by the cease-fire 
resolution and continues to breach it -- it is the fourth 
opportunity this gang has been given to abide by the resolution 
-- the forces of unity and legitimacy are going to force it into 
respecting and abiding by it. 
  The brother commander in chief of the Armed Forces 
reiterated 
our country's commitment to all the clauses of the Security 
Council resolution. He stressed that our valiant Armed Forces 
continue to be fully observant of the cease-fire resolution 
despite the recurring acts of aggression on their positions by 
elements of this rebellious gang, which is in its last gasps of 
breath and which is destroying all vital economic installations 
before its departure, including the Aden refinery and the 
electricity plant at al-Hiswah and other facilities as an act of 
revenge on the homeland and an expression of hatred for the 
Yemeni people and their achievements. 
  The brother president applauded acts of heroism by members 
of 
our valiant Armed Forces, who spearheaded the battle of honor 
and dignity for the homeland and people in the cause of unity, 
democracy, and constitutional legality. They have proved 
valiant heroes fearless of death in that they are fighting the 
cause of right against wrong. They are also fighting for the 
great principles and achievements that our people have fought 
for -- unity and democracy, above all. He exhorted the brother 
heroic officers and NCO's of the Armed and Security Forces to 
show increased vigilance and awareness and to be prepared to 
fulfill their patriotic duty. A great people stand behind you, 
rallying around you, supporting your efforts, and watching your 
generosity and sacrifices so that the banner of Yemeni unity 
stays hoisted over the united Yemeni homeland. Unity means 
pride, dignity, glory, and stability. No matter what the cost 
and the sacrifices our people and our Armed Forces may have to 
make, there can be no abandonment of unity. There is no future 
for Yemen without unity, asserted the brother president. 
  The brother president was accompanied, during the visit, by 
Interior Minister Brigadier General Yahya al-Mutawakkil.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah has said 
that Yemeni unity is an existent reality that was not imposed by 
force, adding that the separatist elements in the [Yemeni] 
Socialist Party [YSP] leadership are resorting to fighting to 
impose secession by force. He noted that Yemen is one state in 
terms of land and people and that the Yemeni people adhere to 
their unity which is an expression of their will. 
  In a statement to the Qatari radio broadcast yesterday 
evening, Basindwah noted that the secessionist gang violated the 
cease-fire announced by the Yemeni Government before the arrival 
in Sanaa of brother Lakhdar Ibrahimi, envoy of the UN secretary 
general. He added that this gang intensified naval and aerial 
bombardment of the forces of unity and legitimacy to call in 
international observers, something which is unacceptable. He 
said the military confrontation is not between sides, but 
between the legislative government and a gang rebelling against 
legitimacy and seeking secession.

  [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 12 (AFP) -- Aid workers hoped 
Sunday to be able to unload urgently-needed medical supplies for 
Yemen's war wounded from a Red Cross ship stranded off the coast 
of Aden for 24 hours awaiting security guarantees. 
  The Bonsella has been off the port city since Saturday 
trying 
to unload its cargo destined for Yemeni hospitals where stocks 
are rapidly running out, the International Committee of the Red 
Cross (ICRC) said. 
  Sandro Barana, head of the ICRC delegation in Aden, said 
they 
hoped to be able to enter the port on Sunday after obtaining 
guarantees from rival north and south leaders. 
  The Bonsella had tried on June 7 to enter the port but was 
prevented by the fighting. 
  The ICRC has been providing aid to both sides in the Yemen's 
civil war which broke out on May 5 between troops loyal to 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his southern rival 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid. 
  Northern Yemeni gunners killed two and wounded 22 in Aden 
late Saturday in the latest round of fighting which has seen 
three ceasefires collapse.

  [Text] The House of Representatives convened under Speaker 
'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar this morning. The session was 
attended by brothers Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman 'Abd-al-Qadir Bafadl, 
minister of supply and trade; 'Ali Salih al-Salami, minister of 
finance; Khalid 'Abd-al-Salam Karman, minister of legal affairs; 
Muhammad Ahmad al-Junayd, governor of the Yemeni Central Bank; 
and Jamal Muhammad 'Abduh, deputy minister of transport; along 
with representatives of public supply corporations. 
  Representatives of the government reported on financial, 
supply, and economic matters and set out ways to promote the 
country's national economy and put its financial and monetary 
affairs in order. They emphasized that the government is 
capable of moving and continuing to meet the public requirements 
for food items and basic services throughout the Republic of 
Yemen and those of official and private organizations to keep 
the developmental process going. 
  The House then heard a brief report about the special 
parliamentary committee it assigned to study the developments 
that our country has witnessed [words indistinct] in connection 
with forming parliamentary delegations to be sent out to 
brotherly and friendly states and the other functions of the 
committee. 
  House Speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar then 
reported to the deputies about the outcome of his meeting with 
brother Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN secretary general's special 
envoy to the Republic of Yemen. The meeting was good, and 
Brahimi came out with the impression that the Yemeni people were 
wedded to their unity and resolved to stand up to the 
rebellious, separatist elements. What is happening in Yemen, 
Brahimi was told, is a domestic affair, the house speaker added. 
  The House of Representatives is to reconvene tomorrow 
morning, Monday, God willing.

<F P=106> [Report by Souleimane Nimer] </F>
  [Text] Mayfa'ah, Yemen, June 12 (AFP) -- Northern Yemeni 
forces are closing in on the home turf of southern leader 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid and were Sunday posted 55 kilometres (33 miles) 
from the port city of al-Mukalla in Hadhramaut Province. 
  It was the first time since the civil war broke out five 
weeks ago that President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's troops were 
reported to be in Hadhramaut, with the fighting so far centred 
around Aden and Shabwah provinces. 
  Al-Bid, who declared a breakaway southern state on May 21, 
has been based in his home town of al-Mukalla for several weeks, 
after moving from his political headquarters in the southern 
port of Aden. 
  UN peace envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi was Sunday headed for 
al-Mukalla to meet al-Bid, after visits to Sanaa, Amman, the 
Saudi city of Jeddah, and Muscat. 
  "Our forces are ready to mount an assault on al-Mukalla 
within 48 hours, once we have received the order from the 
military command in Sanaa," Colonel 'Abdallah 'Aliwi told an AFP 
correspondent in Mayfa', west of the port. 
  The first northern lines were around 55 kilometres (33 
miles) 
from al-Mukalla, in a mountainous a?ea overlooking the coastal 
town of Burum on the Arabian Sea. Another officer said the 
forward positions were established Thursday night. 
  The two sides fight artillery duels and southern warplanes 
carry out raids over the northern army posts, he said. 
  Three soldiers were wounded on Saturday as shells crashed 
around 20 metres (yards) from an army escort for journalists 
touring the region. Northern units hit back with rounds of 
artillery fire. 
  "If the southern bombardment keeps up, we will be forced to 
resume our advance toward Burum and al-Mukalla," said Colonel 
'Ali Haydar Salih, head of the army's 5th Brigade which was 
fortifying its positions. 
  On the road from 'Ataq in the neighbouring oil province of 
Shabwah and Mayfa'ah, northern troops have total control. 
  But the route was filled with craters, which northern 
officers said were caused by southern air raids. The empty 
casings of anti- aircraft rockets littered the sides of the road.

  [Excerpt] An official source in the Democratic Republic of 
Yemen [DRY] has issued the following statement to the Yemeni 
News Agency, Aden: The Sanaa regime has continued to play the 
cease-fire declaration game by first stating the timing of a 
cease-fire and then throwing its forces into a new act of 
aggression by striking at residential quarters and vital 
installations. It then claims the DRY is the one breaking the 
cease-fire. Yesterday the (?collapsing) Sanaa regime said we 
had broken the cease-fire. 
  For the fifth time they declared a cease-fire and then 
ordered their forces to attack on all fronts, while sending 
their aircraft and launching their shells and missiles against 
peaceful residents and vital installations. They made several 
such attacks this morning on the Aden refinery and its civilian 
airport and mounted attacks and shelling on all fronts. Our 
forces and people are heroically resisting and are exhibiting 
legendary steadfastness. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Brother Dr. Sayf Sa'il Khalid, member of the 
Political Bureau and secretary of the Yemeni Socialist Party 
[YSP] Central Committee, met yesterday with representatives of 
newspapers and news agencies both Arab and international who are 
in Aden to cover the events and destructive war waged by the 
Sanaa regime against our people in the Democratic Republic of 
Yemen. During the meeting Dr. Sayf Sa'il briefed the press and 
news agency correspondents on the latest developments in the 
military and political situation in the Yemeni arena. 
  During his briefing, he said that the social and political 
forces, which were organizing and pushing the war were 
fossilized fundamentalists, besides some shaykh-based and 
backward tribalist forces and some totalitarian bureaucratic 
civilian and military leaders in the Sanaa regime. He said that 
the basic objectives of these forces was not the defense of 
unity but the imposition of a backward, fundamentalist, 
military, totalitarian and dictatorial regime in Yemen which 
would strike down everything relating to modernism, democracy, 
and civilization, thus taking Yemen many steps backward. He 
said that the victims of this war were the Yemeni people who had 
no control over their affairs regardless of their groups or 
whether they were elderly people, heroes, men or women. The war 
had consumed thousands of people, destroyed the economic and 
military foundations of Yemen, and destabilized the moral and 
cultural ideals of the Yemeni people [passage omitted] In his 
reply to a question connected with the position of the 
Governorate of Aden, Dr. Sayf Sa'il said that Aden would be a 
hard nut to crack and we would not allow it to fall, whatever 
the price. He pointed out that great victories had been achieved 
in the governorates of Shabwah, al-Dali, and Radfan and yet one 
should not talk about victories in this war because the Yemeni 
people were its fuel. 
  With regard to the position relating to the UN Security 
Council decision and the mission of Lakhdar Brahimi, the envoy 
of the UN secretary general, Dr. Sayf Sa'il said: We welcomed 
the Security Council resolution when it was issued and announced 
our commitment to it. However, the other side is the one that 
violates this resolution. It verbalizes its commitment to it 
but on the ground it practices the opposite under the illusion 
of achieving victories and imposing a fait accompli. This is 
false and deceptive for those laboring under it. 
  In conclusion, he referred to the importance of the role of 
Lakhdar Brahimi and said: We are awaiting his arrival in Aden 
because the urgent task is to stop the war and later settle the 
dispute through dialogue.

<F P=106> [Report by Taj-al-Din 'Abd-al-Haqq] </F>
  [Text] Abu Dhabi -- Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, 
prime minister of the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY], has 
said that Aden does not object to the dispatch to Yemen of an 
Arab deterrent force to observe the cease-fire and disengage the 
forces. 
  He said this in a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT in Abu 
Dhabi 
yesterday. Al-'Attas said that the DRY's priority now is "a 
cease-fire and then to discuss the procedures for disengaging 
the forces and deploying observers." 
  He added that the DRY urges the Gulf Cooperation Council 
[GCC] states and Egypt, to which the credit for the UN Security 
Council resolution goes, to continue their role in the Security 
Council so that the council may continue to implement its 
resolution and take the necessary measures for that in 
accordance with the stipulations of the UN Charter. 
  Al-'Attas said that "Recognition of the DRY is not our 
priority, because recognition has become a reality since war 
broke out. The pressing question now is to halt the war." He 
pointed out that northern forces have recently -- having failed 
to achieve the aims it had set for themselves -- resorted to 
hitting residential areas and civilian and economic 
installations. Al-'Attas said that Aden's contacts with the GCC 
states have borne fruit over the past two days, as the United 
States has issued a new statement expressing utmost concern over 
the continuation of the fighting and openly expressing its 
position calling for an immediate halt to the war. 
  He stressed that the continuation of the war will result in 
numerous complications, and that "the northerners' insistence on 
continuing it reflects despair and loss of control." 
  On the Arab League's exclusion from the diplomatic efforts 
Aden is making, al-'Attas said that "the DRY has from the outset 
referred to the Arab League, and contacts are continuing with 
it, as a meeting has been held with the Arab League secretary 
general." 
  He pointed out that the league supports the UN Security 
Council resolution, but the conditions the Arab League is 
experiencing are not helping it to take a decision. He said 
that "the DRY welcomes any role by the league in the framework 
of the UN Security Council resolution."

  [Text] House of Representatives Speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah 
Bin- Husayn al-Ahmar this morning met with brother Lakhdar 
Brahimi, envoy of UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Butrus Ghali. 
Brother Dr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab Mahmud, staff member of the House 
Speaker's Office, and several House deputies attended. 
  At the outset of the meeting, the brother House speaker 
welcomed brother Lakhdar Brahimi in his second home, the 
Republic of Yemen. He added: We thank you for bothering to make 
this trip to achieve the mission assigned to you--a humanitarian 
Arab mission. It is a duty that must be performed by a 
well-known Arab figure, like you. This is because you are a 
fraternal Arab who believes in Arab unity and bringing the 
peoples of various countries together. God willing, your 
mission will be a success. We will support you. 
  Shaykh al-Ahmar affirmed that what is taking place in the 
Republic of Yemen is a domestic affair. Brother Shaykh 
'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar discussed Yemeni unity, saying: 
Yemeni unity has been blessed by all fraternal Arabs, who have 
deemed it a step along the road of the desired Arab unity, which 
has long been the dream of the Arabs. The Arabs have deemed 
unity the Arab nation's (?sublime) objective. 
  Brother al-Ahmar reiterated that any laxity toward Yemeni 
unity would be a departure from this objective, which we all 
seek to achieve. 
  During this meeting, the brother House speaker also 
explained 
the joint unity-orientated action from the outset until it was 
crowned by the proclamation of the Republic of Yemen in 1990. 
Unity was achieved through democratic methods, dialogue, and 
peaceful means. It enjoyed the broad support of all sectors of 
the people, al-Ahmar said. 
  The House speaker indicated that Yemen--territory and 
people--has always been united. But, apparently, there were two 
distinct regimes. 
  Shaykh al-Ahmar elaborated on the crisis since its eruption, 
noting that certain elements within the leadership of the 
Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] fabricated it, until these elements 
caused a flare-up in the military situation on 27 April 
1994--the first anniversary of the parliamentary elections held 
in united Yemen. 
  The House speaker concluded by saying: The most important 
issues are Yemeni unity, democracy, and legitimacy. He affirmed 
that unity is the most important thing that concerns the people 
and their representatives. The choice they are facing is 
between either safeguarding unity or death, he contended. 
  For his part, brother Lakhdar Brahimi, envoy of the UN 
secretary general, spoke, saying: Yesterday and the day before 
yesterday, I had the honor of meeting several officials, headed 
by the brother Presidential Council chairman. I have also met 
with representatives of the political parties. Today, I am 
meeting with you. The mission I am conducting at the 
instructions of the UN secretary general is aimed at enabling me 
to find the facts pertaining to the situation of the brothers in 
this country, and informing them that the international 
community is concerned over what is taking place in this 
country, and that the brothers are required to overcome their 
difficulties by themselves. 
  Brahimi added: I feel that I am in my own country, and among 
my brothers. We are agreed that Yemen is an important country, 
with and age-old history, and that it is only natural for 
difficulties to emerge in all countries and societies. God 
willing, we will overcome these difficulties. The brothers 
reiterated to me at previous meetings that dialogue is an 
approach acceptable to Yemenis. God willing, dialogue will help 
create a strong Yemen that contributes to the well-being of its 
people and its neighbors. 
  Afterward, brother Lakhdar Brahimi listened to the views of 
the House members who attended the meeting, who represent 
various parliamentary blocs at the House of Representatives. 
These deputies represent parties, political organizations, and 
various Yemeni governorates. Some of them are independents. 
  The House members asserted that Yemeni unity has been 
established through peaceful and democratic means, that this 
unity has been grounded in dialogue, and that Yemeni unity has 
been achieved through a popular and democratic will, without any 
pressures. They added that secession is meant to be forced on 
us. They hoped that fraternal Arabs will support Yemeni unity, 
because it is the first cornerstone in the edifice of Arab 
unity. They went on to say that bias in favor of anything other 
than Yemeni unity is tantamount to supporting fighting. 
Besides, the entire Yemeni people are unified. They adhere to 
unity, and can in no way accept secession. 
  The House members noted that those who declared secession 
constitute a small minority that rebelled against legitimacy, 
one that does not represent the YSP. This is because it is an 
established fact that the YSP has supported and backed unity. 
The deputies affirmed that dialogue must have bases. One of 
these bases is that any political solution to the crisis must 
safeguard Yemeni unity. Any such solutions should not result in 
tearing Yemen apart after it has been united, the deputies 
argued. 
  The parliamentarians affirmed the need for the United 
Nations 
to protect legitimacy and consecrate Yemeni unity, because unity 
came as a response to the will and demands of the people, who 
supported the Constitution in a public referendum and backed 
constitutional legitimacy at the polling stations on 27 April 
1993, when they elected their representatives to the first 
parliament of unified Yemen. Consequently, the people 
unanimously support unity and legitimacy. They will not abandon 
unity, regardless of the sacrifices entailed.

  [Text] Brother Lakhdar Brahimi, envoy of UN Secretary 
General Dr. Butrus Ghali, left Sanaa at noon today at the end of 
a two-day visit to our country. During the visit, he met with 
Presidential Council Chairman brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih, government officials, and leaders of political 
parties and organizations. 
  In a statement to the Yemeni News Agency, SABA', the UN 
envoy 
said he thanks all those with whom he met and who made it easy 
for him to carry out his mission in our country. He added that 
his visit was a good beginning. He went on to say: However, we 
aspire for much more. We aspire to see the problem that brought 
us here solved. 
  Brother Lakhdar Brahimi thanked the brother officials in our 
country for their abidance once again by the cease-fire that was 
announced yesterday, and which made him optimistic. He said he 
is disappointed because the cease-fire did not hold last night. 
  Brahimi went on to say: These issues are not easy. We are 
determined to persist with our demand that the cease-fire hold. 
God willing, we will see all sides, speak the same language, 
and make the same demands. 
  In his statement, the UN envoy said he hoped that the 
situation would end with dialogue, the acceptance of which was 
announced by the officials of our country. 
  Brahimi added: It is only natural that each side has its own 
principles, which it seeks to impose. He noted that he will 
discuss this, and speak of conditions later. 
  The UN envoy reiterated the need to see the cease-fire 
holding as soon as possible. He noted that he will continue 
with his contacts to lay the grounds for the resumption of 
dialogue between brothers. 
  In reply to a question on the moves that he intends to 
discuss to achieve an effective cease-fire, the UN envoy said 
that there are principles, and that the main principle to be 
upheld is that it is always preferable to resolve such issues 
between the concerned sides. If other issues are to be 
examined, then such issues can be discussed at the appropriate 
time. 
  The UN envoy was seen off at the airport by brother Ahmad 
Dayfallah al-'Uzayz, Foreign Ministry under secretary for 
political affairs; brother 'Abdallah al-Wahhabi, director of 
protocol at the Foreign Ministry; representatives of protocol at 
the Presidential Council; the ambassadors of Morocco, Algeria, 
Tunisia, and Libya; brother 'Awni al-'Ani, resident UN 
representative in Sanaa; and Ambassador Muhammad Hadi 'Awad, 
head of the Arab Department at the Foreign Ministry.

  [Excerpts] Jeddah, 11 Jun -- Yemeni sources here expected 
the arrival of the southern Yemeni official, Abu Bakr al-'Attas, 
to Jeddah to meet the UN envoy to Yemen, Lakhdar Brahimi, who 
arrived in Saudi Arabia late last night from Amman with a 
mission aimed at ending the current crisis in Yemen. 
  Diplomatic sources told KUNA that Brahimi would hold talks 
with Saudi officials here to acquaint them with the latest 
developments in Yemen, particularly after 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's 
welcome of a Saudi role to settle the Yemeni crisis completely. 
[passage omitted] 
  In contact with KUNA, Yemeni sources said that Haydar Abu 
Bakr al-'Attas, prime minister of the Democratic Republic of 
Yemen, which was recently proclaimed, and its foreign affairs 
minister, 'Abdallah al-Asnaj, would arrive in Jeddah at a later 
time to start talks with the UN envoy, which would be completed 
in Mukkala if a real cease-fire agreement was reached. 
  It is worth mentioning that Saudi Arabia has so far not 
officially announced that it was hosting these talks. However, 
according to Yemeni sources, it is not unlikely that Saudi 
Arabia "would host these talks if al-'Attar and al-Asnaj arrived 
in the presence of a Gulf desire for immediate cease-fire."

  [Text] Brother Salim Salih Muhammad, Yemeni Socialist Party 
[YSP] Presidential Council member, talked by phone from his 
place of residence in London with brother Lakhdar Brahimi, envoy 
of Butrus Butrus-Ghali, UN secretary general, who is currently 
in Jeddah continuing his efforts to stop the fighting, prevent 
Yemeni bloodshed, and implement the Security Council's 
resolution. 
  During the contact, brother Salim Salih Muhammad explained 
the recent developments, Sanaa's refusal to abide by the 
cease-fire, and the imposition of a state of siege on Aden by 
threatening to cut the water supplies, hit the economic and 
civilian utilities and shell the popular quarters without 
discrimination, a matter which led to the killing of hundreds of 
women, children, and old men. He affirmed to him the importance 
of speeding up the implementation of the Security Council's 
resolution and sending international observers to supervise the 
ceasefire and start the talks, or take deterrent measures 
against the side which rejected these international resolutions. 
  Lakhdar Brahimi affirmed the importance of stopping the 
fighting and implementing the Security Council's resolutions 
immediately, and that he was about to meet 'Ali Salim al-Bid and 
the other leaders in order to enable him to submit his report to 
Butrus- Ghali, UN secretary general, who would in turn present 
it to the UN Security Council to take additional resolutions 
which would lead to the imposition of the state of stability and 
peace in Yemen and the rest of the region.

  [Excerpt] Lakhdar Brahimi, the envoy of the UN secretary 
general, arrived in al-Mukalla at 1800 today on his mission to 
establish the facts surrounding the war being fought in Yemen 
and with the objective of bringing about implementation of the 
UN Security Council cease-fire resolution. In a statement to 
the Yemeni News Agency, Aden, he said his presence here was to 
continue talks with the brother officials on the same issues as 
discussed in Sanaa. He went on to say: I believe that the 
sides concerned are those in the north and south of Yemen. What 
we have heard is that they all want a cease-fire, which is what 
we want and want to implement. 
  Brahimi stressed that first and foremost was the 
substantiation of the cease-fire. We shall be talking with the 
brothers about this matter; everything has to be talked about. 
He expressed regret over the violation of the cease-fire, 
saying he hoped it would finally be implemented. [passage

<F P=106> [Report by Nadim Kawash] </F>
  [Text] Abu Dhabi, June 12 (AFP) -- Yemen looks set to 
emerge from its civil war with a badly-damaged infrastructure, a 
shattered army and the spectre of political uncertainty scaring 
away potential investors for some time to come. 
  Already one of the world's poorest countries, Yemen can ill 
afford the added strain on its struggling economy of a 
full-scale war between rival north and south leaders. 
  Airports, harbours, a key oil refinery, roads and water and 
power plants are reported to have sustained heavy damage in the 
five-week- old civil war put at billions of dollars by a 
southern leader. 
  The appointed foreign minister of the breakaway southern 
state of the Yemen Democratic Republic 'Abdallah al-Asnaj told 
AFP Yemen would be counting on regional and international aid to 
fund reconstruction. 
  "The war will have serious consequences on the economy. 
Losses are very large and surpass all estimates. They are in 
billions of dollars because the infrastructure and public 
utilities have been badly damaged," al-Asnaj told AFP during a 
visit to Abu Dhabi. 
  But any outside aid could prove to be at the expense of 
development promised when the former conservative North Yemen 
and the Marxist South were merged in May 1990. 
  "We hope Arab and international funds will extend aid to 
help 
us in rebuilding after the war. 
  "We will also use our own resources. But this will be at the 
expense of development and the aid will only aggravate our debt 
problems. In a nutshell, the economic situation will be 
horrible," he said. 
  Even before the war broke out on May 5, Yemen's economy was 
reeling under heavy debt, inflation, negative growth, 
unemployment and deficits in its budget and balance of payments. 
  The country's debt is estimated at seven to nine billion 
dollars and its budget deficit was projected at around 800 
million dollars in 1993, nearly 83 percent of the revenues. 
  Inflation was as high as 35 percent in 1992, putting further 
pressure on the national currency the riyal. 
  Its current account suffered a 342 million dollars deficit 
in 
1992 while exports remained far below imports, standing at 27 
million dollars and 119 million dollars a month respectively in 
the first half of 1993. 
  Despite a steady increase in oil output peaking at its 
current 335,000 barrels per day (bpd) compared with 200,000 
(bpd) in 1993, Yemen's Gross Domestic Product recorded negative 
growths of 2.5 and 3.9 percent in 1992 and 1991. No official 
figures on the economy were published in 1993. 
  "Yemen's economy had just started to stand on its feet with 
more oil exports and economic reforms. But after such damage to 
its vital facilities, it appears to be back to the scratch," a 
Western diplomat said. 
  The diplomat added that whatever the outcome of the power 
struggle between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his southern 
rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid "the political atmosphere will remain 
poisoned for a long time (...) this will naturally affect the 
flow of aid and investment." 
  Al-Asnaj said: "We will not be able to stand on our feet 
alone. We need help from our brothers. The task of 
reconstruction is not easy and economic difficulties could 
exacerbate social problems." 
  The country's economic problems were further worsened during 
the Gulf crisis when Saudi Arabia expelled more than 700,000 
Yemenis in retaliation for Sanaa's perceived sympathy with the 
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. 
  Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Arab states were the main aid 
donors to Yemen before they froze assistance following the 
invasion.

    [Editorial Report] The following review of the 31 May issue 
of the Cairo Arabic-language newspaper AL-SHA'B summarizes 
articles that are Islamic in nature. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Muslim Brothers, Labor Party Youths Arrested 
  2. Government Campaign Against Muslim Brotherhood Criticized 
  3. Muslim Brotherhood Deputy Guide Defends Group 
<H5>  MUSLIM BROTHERS, LABOR PARTY YOUTHS ARRESTED </H5>
  An unattributed 120-word report on page 1 of AL-SHA'B says 
that "within the framework of the mounting government campaign 
against the Muslim Brotherhood, the security forces have 
arrested eight brothers. They were brought before the 
prosecution, which ordered that they be detained for 15 days." 
Among the imprisoned brothers is Ibrahim Sharaf, private 
secretary of the general guide of the Muslim Brotherhood. They 
were accused of belonging to an "illegal group." 
  In another unattributed 500-word report on page 3, the paper 
writes about the arrest of Labor Party youths in various 
governorates for distributing leaflets on the occasion of 'Id 
al-Adha. 
<H5>  GOVERNMENT CAMPAIGN AGAINST MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD CRITICIZED </H5>
  A 400-word article by Ahmad al-Suyufi on page 4 explains the 
role of the security forces vis-a-vis the people. The writer 
begins by explaining the difficult task of the security forces. 
He says: "The security men in Egypt should be pitied. Our 
impotent government has entrusted them with solving all the 
problems of Egypt. The policemen are asked to resolve 
political, economic, and social problems." They decide who is 
an extremist, moderate, terrorist, or a good citizen. They also 
decide which political parties cooperate with the government and 
which oppose it, which is publications are enlightened and which 
reckless, and which professional unions are good and which bad. 
Problems are tackled by the security forces, not by the 
politicians. 
  The writer then refers to the government campaign against 
the 
Muslim Brotherhood "just because they dare to voice their views 
on our national issues." He asks: "What is their crime? 
Frankly speaking, the issue is not detached from what is 
happening everywhere in the world. What is happening to the 
Brothers is not detached from what is happening in Bosnia, 
Somalia, Iraq, Yemen, Libya, Kashmir, Algeria, Tunisia, and 
Burma. It is the same method and the hidden hands are the same. 
No one will believe the nonsense that the Brothers stand behind 
and encourage terrorism." 
<H5>  MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD DEPUTY GUIDE DEFENDS GROUP </H5>
  AL-SHA'B publishes on page 5 a 2,300-word article by Mustafa 
Mashhur, deputy guide of the Muslim Brotherhood, in which he 
defends the group against accusations of involvement in 
terrorism. He begins by stressing that "not a single member of 
the Muslim Brotherhood" has participated in any disturbances or 
terrorist incidents during the past quarter century. 
Nevertheless, he continues, "some tendentious writers have 
continued to accuse the Brothers of involvement in terrorism and 
violence, and to describe the groups that are known to embrace 
violence as offspring of the Muslim Brotherhood." He says that 
the Brothers at times have tried to respond to these writers and 
refute their false accusations. The Muslim Brotherhood has 
always emphasized its religious orientation and exercised its 
legal activity through the official institutions, such as the 
People's Assembly, the professional associations, faculty clubs 
at educational institutions, and the local councils. "The 
public," he says "became confident of our moderate methods, 
which are far removed from violence and terrorism." But as soon 
as the president said in an interview with the German 
publication DER SPIEGEL that the Muslim Brotherhood encourages 
extremists, the national press and their chief editors and 
writers began attacking it and instigating the regime against 
it. Sensational headlines began appearing in the press, linking 
the Muslim Brotherhood with what happened at the Lawyers 
Association. 
  Mashhur then gives a brief history of the Muslim Brotherhood 
since 1948, when Hasan al-Banna was murdered for sending 
fedayeen to confront the Zionist gangs in Palestine, and notes 
that various state leaders have come and gone, but the Muslim 
Brotherhood remains. He says that the Muslim Brotherhood 
resumed their moderate, legitimate activity under President 
Mubarak. The regime and some tendentious quarters were 
displeased when the Islamists won in the Lawyers Association 
elections. 
  Referring to the recent incidents at the Lawyers 
Association, 
Mashhur says: "I would like to emphasize that the Muslim 
Brotherhood does not interfere in the internal affairs of the 
associations." But, he continues, they are reassured that the 
members abide by the correct Islamic behavior code. He also 
denies accusations that the Muslim Brotherhood have exploited 
the incident and turned public opinion against the regime. 
  Continuing his defense of the Muslim Brotherhood, Mashhur 
says that al-Sadat once said that there is no politics in 
religion and no religion in politics; we objected to this 
saying. Al-Sadat later amended it and said that Islam is a 
religion and a state. Mashhur expounds on this idea by saying 
that Islam has from the beginning been a complete and 
comprehensive religion, regulating the lives of people in the 
political, economic, social, military, and other fields. Islam 
is not just a religion. People must abide by its teachings in 
all aspects of life. There is need for a state and government 
to implement God's shari'ah. 
  Mashhur goes on to say that "it is unconstitutional to 
prevent the Islamists from establishing a political party." He 
says there is no proof that the establishment of an Islamic 
political party in Egypt will be followed by the establishment 
of a Christian party. The Muslim Brotherhood's relations with 
the brother Copts has always been good. He stresses that "Islam 
is the religion of justice, peace, freedom, and equality. It is 
against dictatorship and oppression." What happened in Algeria 
is that a regime, supported by the army, has destroyed the 
democratic system and canceled the free elections which brought 
the Islamists to power. It was not the Islamists who destroyed 
democracy, he says. 
  Mashhur denies that the Muslim Brotherhood has a secret 
apparatus or a military wing. He admits that they did have such 
bodies in the 1940's when the Zionist gangs were fighting the 
Palestinians and when the British colonialists occupied Egypt. 
He says now conditions have changed, and "there is no more need 
for a secret apparatus or a military wing. We support God and 
His religion, which is the official religion of the state. 
Regrettably, we find that the ruling regime is trying to curb 
the activity of those who support God and His religion." 
  He continues: Some say that the Muslim Brotherhood's aim is 
to seize power, after which it supposedly will prevent a 
multiparty system. "We have denied this claim over and over. 
We demand that government rule be according to the shari'ah, 
but we do not demand to rule ourselves." We said if others 
ruled according to the shari'ah, we would support them. Would 
anyone seeking power for temporal gains and facing the 
tribulations we have faced for half a century have persevered? 
We demand rule according to the shari'ah; this is a religious 
duty of every Muslim man and woman, rulers and subjects. "We 
are fully convinced that Islam is the solution to all our 
problems, because it comes from God, who created us and who 
knows what is good and what is bad for us." 
  Mashhur concludes: "There is an international campaign by 
the enemies of Islam led by the Zionists, the Western crusaders, 
the Hindus, and others headed by the Zionist enemy and America. 
They are fighting Islam and the Muslims, as we see everywhere." 
These enemies think that with their material power they can 
destroy Islam, but they delude themselves. God will safeguard 
his religion, he says.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: Israel continues to tighten its iron 
grip on south Lebanon and commit further acts of aggression on 
the area's defenseless villages and towns and issue ever more 
serious threats with a view to blackmailing Lebanon and putting 
pressure on Syria. On the other hand, Israeli officials have 
been hinting at progress in the talks with Syria and adverse 
consequences for those who may fall behind in the peace process. 
Israel's strategy seems to be that the Arabs must compete with 
each other to conclude peace. By such competition, the Israeli 
argument goes, the Arabs are likely to forgo some, if not the 
substance, of their rights, as happened with the Palestinian 
side. By thus falling into the trap one by one, the Arabs would 
find they had been sucked into lame and lopsided settlements 
that are nothing like the kind of true, universal peace craved 
by the Arab masses. 
  To advance that end, Israel goes out of its way to give the 
impression that the talks with Syria have made substantial 
headway, and that the upcoming tour of Warren Christopher will 
see a qualitative change, when in fact no progress to speak of 
has been made and in his previous tours Christopher did not 
raise any ideas promoting the implementation of UN Security 
Council resolutions. Christopher has thus far confined himself 
to the role of mailman. All the clamor whipped up by Israel is 
designed to entice the Arab parties into the trap of separate 
and unfair settlements and negate the underlying foundations of 
the Madrid conference. 
  From day one of the peace process, Syria has warned against 
such Israeli tactics and repeatedly pressed home to the Arabs 
the need to coordinate their moves and stick to the bases of a 
just and comprehensive peace so that all the Arab parties 
negotiate from a position of strength and guard against a 
forfeiture of their rights. Syria has often enough emphasized 
that Arab coordination ranks high on its agenda, and that it 
will never relinquish any of the Arab rights or a grain of Arab 
soil. Syria regards the Middle East conflict and the peace 
process from a pan-Arab perspective. The kind of peace 
settlement we want is one that meets Arab rights and aspirations 
and removes Israeli occupation from all Arab territory. Beyond 
that, Syria has made it plain that Warren Christopher's contacts 
have yet to register any progress and that a yawning gap 
separates the Syrian and Israeli positions. Syria has also 
made it clear that it adheres to all the principles agreed upon 
at the conferences of the Arab foreign ministers. Syria has let 
it be known that Israel does not want peace and that its sinful 
and savage acts of aggression against Lebanon are calculated 
extortion of the Lebanese Government and an attempt sour 
Syrian-Lebanese relations and drag Lebanon into a separate deal. 
  It is indeed laughable and preposterous that Uri Lubrani 
should appoint himself as a trustee over Lebanon and shed tears 
over Lebanon's sovereignty. Isn't it Israel that is occupying 
Lebanese territory and killing Lebanese civilians and 
perpetrating daily acts of devastating aggression? Lubrani has 
stated unequivocally that only once it severs its ties with 
Syria and sets up ties with Israel at the expense of Syria, can 
Lebanon be a sovereign country. Lubrani ignores the catastrophes 
that have hit the Lebanese at the hands of Israel and the fact 
that if it were not for Syria and its firm stand against the 
Zionist partitionist scheme, Lebanon would have been little more 
than limbs stinking with the odor of death, devastation, and 
fire. 
  Lebanon has recuperated and regained its unity and the 
Zionist scenario of partition has collapsed, as have all 
Israel's plans. The Tel Aviv rulers, nonetheless, will not admit 
defeat. They seem to think that they may keep playing the same 
dirty trick of blackmailing Lebanon and pressuring Syria and 
splitting Arab ranks. They have never been interested in a true 
and decent peace in the Middle East. They do not look beyond 
lame settlements that perpetuate occupation and give them a free 
hand to control the region's resources. It is enough to look at 
the Palestinian arena to understand what Israel is after. 
  The Israeli officials had been wooing the Palestinians away 
from the glare of publicity, and no sooner had they lured them 
into the Oslo and Cairo agreements than they uncovered their 
expansionist, aggressive designs; namely to slice off Jerusalem 
and important sections of the West Bank. They were even at 
pains to humiliate the Palestinians. What Syria had warned 
would happen materialized, and the chances are we are in for 
more of the same if the Arab parties fail to adhere to the 
foundations of peace and coordinate their moves. Hardly a day 
passes without the Israelis urging separate and secret talks to 
promote the same lame agreements that they know will not achieve 
peace. Peace is not a cheap deal; it is a package deal grounded 
in right, justice, and international law. Peace cannot take 
root in the Middle East short of a fair and universal settlement 
providing for a total Israeli pullout from the occupied Arab 
territories. That has been and will continue to be Syria's 
position.

  [Text] Damascus, 12 Jun -- His Royal Highness Prince Sa'ud 
al-Faysal, the minister of foreign affairs, said that he 
conveyed a message from Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King 
Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-Aziz to President Hafiz al-Asad of the Syrian 
Arab Republic. 
  His Highness said: "President al-Asad gave me a message in 
reply within the framework of the continuous coordination, 
consultation and assessment of the situation in the region." 
His highness the foreign minister said this in an exclusive 
statement to the Syrian news agency after his meeting with the 
Syrian president today. 
  He described his talks with President Hafiz al-Asad as 
excellent. He stressed the need to end the fighting in Yemen, 
and his highness said that "war cannot be an instrument for 
cooperation between Arab societies." Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal 
expressed the hope that the mission of Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN 
special envoy to Yemen, would be successful, because it proceeds 
from a general international concern to halt the fighting and 
end the current bloody struggle between the two Yemens. 
  His highness stressed that all the disputed issues could be 
settled peacefully on the basis of affection and brotherliness, 
not fighting. He said: "War cannot be an instrument in 
cooperation and cohesion between Arab societies. Proceeding 
from this, we are all concerned with the need to end the 
fighting as soon as possible. I have also noticed this concern 
from our brothers in Syria". 
  His Royal Highness Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal left Damascus this 
evening after a short visit to Syria.

  [Text] Tunis, 12 Jun (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak 
received Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat at his place of 
residence in Tunis this evening. Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa 
also attended the meeting. After the meeting, 'Arafat said that 
his meeting with President Mubarak is within the framework of 
his constant meetings with him. He expressed pride in the firm 
ties between Palestine and Egypt. He said that he emphasized to 
President Mubarak that the Palestinian people will not forget 
the noble and firm stance of the Egyptian leadership and people, 
noting the efforts President Mubarak made until the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement was signed in Cairo on 4 May. He 
said that the Palestinian people fully appreciate this effort. 
  'Arafat pointed out that he explained to President Mubarak 
certain issues relating to implementing the Israeli-Palestinian 
agreement and the need to implement it honestly and quickly. He 
noted that he focused on the poor state of the infrastructure in 
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip as a result of complete 
destruction -- particularly the schools, hospitals, and 
universities. He noted that the people are suffering from 
problems with the drinking water in Gaza and that kidney failure 
cases are rife in the Gaza Strip as a result of using this 
water. He said: We have to start from square one and expressed 
confidence that brothers and friends will assist the 
Palestinians. 
  'Arafat stressed the need to implement the Cairo agreement 
meticulously and honestly, noting that Israel places obstacles 
in the way. He said: We have to begin receiving powers in the 
West Bank but this procedure is still crippled. He said that 
the Palestinian detainees problem is a basic issue, noting that 
a number of detainees, particularly those with long sentences, 
have not yet been released. He said that the Israelis must 
fulfill their obligations. Concluding his statement, he 
reiterated his greetings and appreciation to the Egyptian 
leadership, government, and people for standing by the 
Palestinian people at the start of their liberation and until 
the Palestinian flag is raised over all the West bank and the 
Gaza Strip.

  [Excerpt] Amman, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- While 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat continues his normal 
political activities, questions continue to be asked about his 
state of health, especially after the reports that he suffered 
symptoms similar to myocardial infarction [al-dhabhah 
al-qalbiyah] symptoms. 
  Sources close to the Palestinian president say that 'Arafat 
was recently fitted with a medical device that puts him under 24 
observation. The sources say that the device's task is to warn 
early of any sudden health condition 30 minutes before it 
occurs. All 'Arafat has to do then is quickly call his private 
physician to supervise his condition. 
  The sources say that the device, which has been fitted in 
the 
Palestinian president's rib cage, is sensitive, effective, and 
reliable. 
  Dr. Ashraf al-Kurdi, who has supervised 'Arafat's health 
since the surgical operation he underwent in al-Husayn Medical 
Center in Amman, stressed that Abu-'Ammar's ['Arafat's] health 
is excellent and that he has suffered no heart troubles at all. 
In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT Dr. al-Kurdi said that 
Abu-'Ammar's admission to the military hospital in Tunis nearly 
two weeks ago was due to a high temperature, a common cold, and 
a minor headache. 
  Dr. al-Kurdi, a prominent neurosurgeon in Jordan and the 
Middle East, denied that Abu-'Ammar suffered any symptoms as a 
result of the head surgery he carried out two years ago. He 
said that that has finished and that that condition was a page 
which has been turned forever. According to Dr. Ashraf 
al-Kurdi, Abu-'Ammar's [blood] pressure is more than good for a 
man in his situation and of his age. He pointed out that the 
enormous pressures the Palestinian president is under and the 
instability he is experiencing always expose him to exhaustion 
-- which causes him to stay in bed even when suffering a common 
cold. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Palestinian Authority member Dr. </F>
Samir Ghawshah in Tunis by Sa'id Mu'addi in Jerusalem; date not 
given; from the "With the Midday Events" program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] The PLO headquarters in Tunis is preparing 
to close following instructions given by Yasir 'Arafat nearly 
one week ago to close of the offices before 15 June in 
preparation for the move to the self-rule area. Several 
committees have been set up in various offices to follow up this 
issue. On this subject, Palestinian Authority member Dr. Samir 
Ghawshah says: 
  [Ghawshah] We are preparing all necessary steps now for 
leaving for the Gaza Strip and Jericho area. A number of the 
revolution's cadres are preparing themselves. A large number of 
security men and policemen who were in Tunisia have left for 
Gaza and Jericho. We hope that these preparations can be 
completed as soon as possible and before the end of this month 
at most. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir, have all buildings used by the PLO 
leadership in Tunis been handed back to their owners? 
  [Ghawshah] What happened was that certain buildings and 
certain administrative offices that were used by the security 
and police forces were decided to be handed over to their owners 
before 15 June. 
  [Mu'addi] Will all offices of the Palestinian leadership be 
moved to the self-rule area, or will some offices remain in 
Tunis? 
  [Ghawshah] Most of these offices will be moved, but some 
offices will remain, especially the Political Department, which, 
according to the agreement, will play its role in following up 
political contacts and foreign relations. 
  [Mu'addi] There are reports saying that 'Arafat's office and 
his residence will remain at his disposal at present. Does this 
mean that his permanent place of residence will remain in Tunis? 
  [Ghawshah] I do not think so. On the contrary, his place of 
residence will be in the Palestinian territories, and mainly 
between Gaza and Jericho, but this does not counter the fact 
that brother Yasir 'Arafat has a number of headquarters in a 
number of Arab countries, one of which will be in Tunis. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir, what about the arrival of Palestinian 
Authority members in the self-rule area? There are conflicting 
reports about this subject. 
  [Ghawshah] As I said, we hope that this will take place 
soon, 
and that preparations be made as soon as possible so that the 
Palestinian Authority will carry out its role in all fields, in 
a manner that serves the causes of our people. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir, what about appointing the rest of the 
Palestinian Authority members? 
  [Ghawshah] Contacts and consultations are still going on. We 
hope that the rest of Palestinian Authority members will be 
appointed when the authority arrives in the homeland.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Ali al-Salih: "Abu-Mazin To Remain in Tunis With </F>
Abu-al-Lutf and Abu-Mahir"] 
  [Excerpt] London -- PLO Executive Committee member Mahmud 
'Abbas (Abu-Mazin) has denied that a decision has been taken to 
close PLO offices in Tunis. He said: "That is untrue." 
  Reports said the day before yesterday that Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat had issued a decision to close all PLO 
offices in Tunis before 15 June on the occasion of what was 
termed the "return to the homeland." 
  Abu-Mazin told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT over the telephone: It is 
not known yet which establishments will remain [in Tunis]. 
However, he expected the Political Department, headed by Faruq 
Qaddumi (Abu-al-Lutf), to keep its offices in Tunis. 
  Asked about the fate of his department (International 
Relations), Abu-Mazin, architect of the Oslo accord, said that 
"it could be abolished or incorporated into the Political 
Department or maybe moved to the inside [the self-rule areas]." 
He went on: "But I will not move to the self-rule areas at the 
moment. I will remain in Tunis." 
  As for Fatah Central Committee member Muhammad Ghunaym 
(Abu-Mahir), he said in this context: All offices, except those 
related to the Political Department, the Returnees Department 
headed by 'Abdallah Hurani (who resigned from the Executive 
Committee), and the general staff, have been or will be closed. 
I mention in particular the offices related to the security and 
military services, most of whose cadres and staff have left for 
the self-rule areas. 
  Abu-Mahir said that the departments concerned with external 
action and the military forces will remain in Tunis. "Other 
departments will move to the inside [the self-rule areas]." On 
his own position, Abu-Mahir said: "We might move from Tunis 
after a period of time, but not to the inside." But he declined 
to name the area to which he is going to move. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Nabil Sha'th, PLO adviser and head of the </F>
Palestinian delegation to the international coordination 
committee of donor states, in Paris by Sa'id Mu'addi in 
Jerusalem; date not given; from the "With the Midday Events" 
program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Sha'th] Meetings were held yesterday with all 
members of the coordination committee of the donor states, 
including the World Bank delegation. I believe they were 
important meetings on the road to translating the obligations 
and promises made by these donor states into quick and direct 
financial aid, which can contribute to pushing things forward to 
establish the new central administrations, to respond to the 
needs of thousands of Palestinians and their families who have 
suffered for a long time under the occupation, and to respond to 
the needs of economic development to create jobs for the 
Palestinians, particularly in the Gaza Strip, who are suffering 
from severe unemployment. The donor states are called upon to 
extend all this aid in a form of specific material aid during 
today's meeting, God willing. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, of course you have reviewed the 
difficult economic situation for the participants in these 
meetings, as well as the need to immediately delivering funds in 
order to implement the self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. What 
approach are the participants states taking? 
  [Sha'th] Undoubtedly, there is an awareness of the pressing 
need for this international aid, which should be in the form of 
quick cash, and not merely commitments and promises. There is 
also a realization that the peace process is completely reliant 
on the Palestinian National Authority's [PNA] success in turning 
this [self-rule] agreement into a tangible thing for the 
Palestinian people. It must let them realize the benefits of 
peace and the other meanings of freedom, dignity, independence, 
and the building of the homeland and economic development. I 
believe that there is a realization of all this. However, we 
are waiting today to see if this realization has been 
transformed into quick aid. 
  [Mu'addi] Are there any reservations by the donor states 
which could obstruct the transferring of funds to the 
Palestinians? 
  [Sha'th] I cannot see true reservations in this sense, 
particularly after the Palestinian Economic Council for 
Development and Reconstruction has been established, after the 
new budget has been prepared, and after the PNA has assumed 
powers in Gaza and Jericho. However, these states should move 
from the state of realization, feeling, and interest into a 
state of paying funds. These states have rules, laws, and 
constitutional institutions, and therefore, we should encourage 
them to move quickly to the stage of implementation. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, what is today's agenda, and when do you 
expect the decision will be made? 
  [Sha'th] Today, there will be a meeting to be attended by 
all 
states. These states' members will make statements, beginning 
with the Palestinian delegation. The meeting will end at 1700 
with a news conference. So, we should expect practical results 
before 1700. 
  [Mu'addi] A final question, what are the sums of money we 
are 
talking of, Dr. Nabil Sha'th? 
  [Sha'th] We are talking about translating promises of more 
than $2 billion into specific sums to be paid during this 
period, or next month and the months which follow, in order to 
rectify the deficit in the budget, and to allow funds to pour 
into economic projects. So, we are talking about $100 million, 
at least, at the beginning.

<F P=106> [Interview with Nabil Sha'th, PLO adviser and head of the </F>
Palestinian delegation to the international coordination 
committee of donor states, by Sufiya 'Amarah in Paris on 10 
June--recorded] 
  [Text] ['Amarah] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, how responsive were the 
donor countries to the Palestinian financial demands? 
  [Sha'th] Today's meeting saw a qualitative change in this 
responsiveness. There has always been Palestinian apprehension 
that assistance might be so late in coming that it would be 
impossible to establish Palestinian institutions on liberated 
Palestinian territory in time to enable them to stand on their 
own and begin an independent Palestinian economy. Today, I say 
that there has been a transformation. It is true the sums we 
are talking about are not great. There is a commitment to offer 
$720 million. Today we obtained a commitment to transfer $40 
million of that in the form of currency during the next week. 
  However, this $40 million is only 40 out of 70, which is the 
deficit in the current expenditure budget of the coming 
Palestinian government within the national authority. This is 
more than half of the amount needed to pay the government's 
expenditure for the next few months. This is enough to cover 
the deficit for three months. It will be followed by a meeting 
on 11 July to fulfill the commitment to cover this deficit. 
  Therefore, today's development was not only progress in 
terms 
of the promised sums but in terms of the monies transferred to 
finance the difficult part, namely, the current expenditure of 
the Palestinian government. 
  ['Amarah] Then you believe this assistance is enough to meet 
the requirements of development and to rebuild the 
infrastructure in the Palestinian autonomy areas, especially the 
Gaza Strip? 
  [Sha'th] These amounts are not budgeted for all the 
expenditures concerning investments or long-term projects. They 
will cover current expenditures, that is, the police, the 
employees of the Palestinian authority, and certain very urgent 
projects, such as programs to rehabilitate Palestinian detainees 
just released, and to give some compensation to thousands of 
Palestinians who have borne the brunt of the occupation, namely, 
the handicapped, the injured, families of martyrs and detainees 
and others. These will be projects to [word indistinct] 
assistance for them economically. There are projects like the 
Gaza cleaning project, which will cost $15 million, employing 
15,000 laborers for three months. Thus, all the manifestations 
of former occupation will be removed, such as barbed wire, 
cement blocks that barricade roads, and the garbage the Israelis 
left on the streets. Therefore, it is an urgent payment to 
implement urgent projects and to cover the expenditures of the 
Palestinian government. 
  We are well aware that this assistance is just the 
beginning. 
The Palestinian people will play their role, which they have 
proved for themselves and the world throughout long years of 
struggle for their homeland. The Palestinians who have been 
steadfast in the occupied territories for many years are asked 
to transform their energies and resources into building their 
independent and free country. Palestinians abroad, who have 
suffered and sacrificed in order to return to their country, and 
who contributed to building the countries of their brothers 
outside Palestine, are now prepared to return to rebuild their 
homeland. I believe self-reliance is the main Palestinian 
motto. This self-reliance now needs support to transform it 
into reality as soon as possible. 
  I would also like to say that the much talked about delay in 
our Arab brothers' assistance to us, which I considered painful, 
is now beginning to become clearer. We say Arab backing has 
always been presented to the Palestinian people. Palestinians 
have always been grateful to their Arab brothers. Some Arabs 
contributed their money, some their own souls, and some their 
land from which the Palestinian people set out--in Lebanon, 
Jordan, Egypt, Syria, Tunisian, the Gulf countries. All these 
Arab states gave their contributions. There were reasons for 
delays in this contribution. 
  Now, I am happy to say that one-quarter of the amount given 
today was contributed by fraternal Saudi Arabia. Two other Arab 
states have promised the World Bank to announce a definite 
amount of assistance. This was not announced today, but it will 
be announced within two days. This will restore to the 
Palestinians the feeling that their Arab brothers are by their 
side in the process of liberation and reconstruction. 
  ['Amarah] Last question, Dr. Sha'th. No definite date has 
been fixed for Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's arrival in 
Jericho. What is the cause of this hesitation? 
  [Sha'th] President Yasir 'Arafat will be returning to his 
homeland for which he fought for many years. He did not link 
his return to his homeland with the realization of all his 
demands of support for this homeland. 'Arafat has expressed the 
Palestinian concern that the international community, which 
pushed toward the peace process and which saluted it in 
Washington on 13 September 1993, is hesitating to carry out its 
responsibility to transform this peace into facts on the ground. 
'Arafat felt this concern. He was expressing to the 
international community his people's concern. But I now believe 
he is ready, as always, to return to this homeland to lead his 
people on their liberated land.

<F P=106> [Interview with Nabil Sha'th, PLO adviser and head of the </F>
Palestinian delegation to the international coordination 
committee of donor states, by Salah Salamah in Paris on 11 
June--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Salamah] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, we welcome you. As 
you know, there are many concerns in the Palestinian arena. The 
implementation of the agreement that was signed by Israel and 
the PLO faces many obstacles. There is the problem of the 
Palestinian detainees, who Israel has set free in accordance 
with unfair conditions, including the condition of keeping these 
freed detainees in the Jericho area to prevent them from 
returning to their homes. What can you tell us about these 
obstacles and their dimensions? 
  [Sha'th] Negotiations for the release of the Palestinian 
detainees continued until the last moment, just before the 
conclusion of the agreement in Cairo on 4 May. The Palestinian 
side insisted -- I reiterate that we concluded an agreement that 
gives all the Palestinian detainees now in Israeli prisons the 
opportunity to be set free. This is what we want implemented: 
First, the immediate release of the 5,000 detainees who, 
according to our agreement, should be released from Israeli 
jails within a period of five weeks from the date the agreement 
was signed. This means this is the last week for the release of 
these 5,000 detainees. We agreed to continue negotiations for 
the release of the others within the next three months. 
  There is a clear agreement on what should be done with this 
group that has been sent to Jericho. Only those who were 
imprisoned for civilian crimes such as those who killed persons 
for nonpolitical reasons, drug smugglers, and thieves should be 
handed over to the PNA, which in turn will either keep them in 
prison or release them. Whatever the category under which they 
fall, they remain within the jurisdiction of the PNA in Gaza and 
Jericho until this authority starts exercising Palestinian 
authority throughout the West Bank. This will take three months 
at the most. 
  As for the other political detainees, they should 
immediately 
be released in the West bank and Gaza and they should return 
home. If the Israeli authorities prevent them from enjoying 
their right to return to their homes, this will constitute a 
violation of the agreement. We communicated this to the Israeli 
delegation which was present at the donor countries conference 
here in Paris. General Rotschild promised to solve this problem 
within 48 hours. [passage omitted] 
  [Salamah] Dr. Sha'th, as part of the Israeli attempt to 
judaize Jerusalem, the Israeli government says it is determined 
to move the Palestinian national institutions from Jerusalem to 
the autonomy areas. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
recently said that this has been agreed upon with the PLO and it 
is mentioned in the Oslo agreement. What is the truth about 
this point? 
  [Sha'th] The Declaration of Principles [DOP] and the Gaza- 
Jericho agreement clearly mention that only the institutions 
whose activity is restricted to Jericho and Gaza should be in 
Gaza and Jericho. But, all the Palestinian institutions which 
serve the Palestinian people in the West Bank and Jerusalem 
remain where they are. The Arab institutions in Jerusalem were 
there before the Gaza-Jericho agreement, and they will continue 
their activities after the PNA extends its jurisdiction beyond 
Gaza and Jericho. 
  The agreement that was signed in Washington says that within 
a period of nine months from the date of the conclusion of that 
agreement -- that is on 13 July -- the PNA must extend its 
authority over all the West Bank. Any postponement of the 
discussion of the final status of Jerusalem does not affect the 
Palestinian institutions in Jerusalem. I believe that the paper 
that was signed by Foreign Minister Peres and sent to late 
Norwegian Foreign Minister Holst is very explicit. The 
Palestinian institutions in Jerusalem will remain there. These 
institutions began their activities during the Likud and 
Shamir's rule. They precede the Labor Party's government and 
the agreement we signed. These institutions should remain to 
serve the Palestinian people in Jerusalem and the other areas of 
the Palestinian territories. They have nothing to do with the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
  When we discuss the final status of Jerusalem, the explicit 
Palestinian stand will emphasize that Jerusalem is a city that 
was occupied in 1967 and should be liberated when a definitive 
solution is reached so that it may be the Palestinian capital of 
the independent Palestinian state. This is very clear and 
represents the sound implementation of UN Security Council 
resolution 242 and the DOP. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Nabil Sha'th, PLO adviser and head of the </F>
Palestinian delegation to the international coordination 
committee of donor states, by Sa'id Mu'addi on 12 June; place 
not given; from the "With the Events" program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] Now that funds from the donor nations 
have been delivered, is the road open for 'Arafat to come to the 
self-rule area? 
  [Sha'th] Without a doubt. President 'Arafat is returning to 
his homeland, in any case. But armed with support, he stands a 
better chance of doing something for his people and, at the same 
time, building the Palestinian authority. 
  [Mu'addi] There are conflicting reports about the date for 
Mr. Yasir 'Arafat's arrival in the self-rule area. Do you know 
when he will arrive? 
  [Sha'th] I am afraid I do not know for sure. President 
'Arafat has his own schedule and plans. He is now preparing for 
the African summit in Tunis. He has to tie up some loose ends 
before he leaves Tunis. He cannot leave anyone behind without a 
plan of action. He cannot leave and close PLO offices in Tunis 
just like that. He does not want to leave the impression that 
he is letting anyone down. There are a few things that he must 
attend to before he moves out from Tunis. I was in touch with 
him yesterday, and today in the morning, and just a few minutes 
ago. I can tell you that he is coming before the end of the 
month, God willing. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, you have attended the recent conference 
of the donor nations in Paris, where a decision was made to 
extend at $42 million grant to the Palestinians. How will the 
money be spent? 
  [Sha'th] This is part of the $77 million that represent the 
deficit in the current budget. The money will also cover vital 
projects to help those Palestinians who have been hurt the most. 
The money will not cover the long-term projects toward which the 
donor nations pledged $720 million for this year. Work on some 
of these projects is already in progress with the participation 
of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, the Palestinian 
Housing Authority, and the UN Development Fund. These are 
separate projects. The Paris meeting considered only how to 
plug the deficit in the current expenses, in other words the 
finances required for running the Palestinian government and the 
upkeep of the Palestinian police force. The money will also go 
toward reducing unemployment in Gaza and rehabilitating freed 
detainees and the disabled and wounded and those who have 
suffered the most as a result of the protracted struggle. 
  [Mu'addi] There have recently been some complications 
regarding the Palestinian detainees and collaborators. How did 
the agreement between Israel and the PLO address these two 
points? 
  [Sha'th] As far as the detainees are concerned, the 
agreement is very clear. By the fifth week of the signing of 
the agreement, 5,000 detainees are supposed to have been freed. 
Israel is supposed to have freed 5,000 detainees as of today. 
Other than that to which the PLO committed itself, they will 
not be obligated to anything. In my opinion, this is a fair 
condition. The Palestinian government and opposition should not 
differ about the general conditions under which the detainees 
are released; namely a commitment to the peace process and the 
terms agreed upon between the PLO and Israel. 
  Regarding the presence of these freed prisoners in Jericho 
or 
elsewhere, the agreement calls for those who were imprisoned for 
common rather than political crimes -- there are those who were 
guilty of theft, smuggling, and murder that have nothing to do 
with resistance and the struggle in which we were involved -- to 
be handed over to the Palestinian authority either to be 
incarcerated or put on parole. Since the Palestinian authority 
will be active only in Gaza and Jericho in the coming three 
months, these should remain in the self-rule area until the 
Palestinian authority extends to the entire West Bank. As for 
the political prisoners who were convicted on political counts 
and for their engagement in acts of resistance, they must be 
freed to return to their homes in Gaza, Jericho, the West Bank, 
and Jerusalem. These are the conditions laid out in the 
agreement which we have to implement, and we must see to it that 
these detainees lead free lives in their homes with their 
families so that the peace begins in earnest and so we may leave 
the past conflict behind us. With the release of the 5,000 
detainees, negotiations should have begun without delay to draw 
up a timetable for freeing the rest of the detainees and 
prisoners along the same lines and principles which we agreed 
should govern the freeing of the first 5,000. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, when do you expect to arrive with your 
family in the self-rule area? 
  [Sha'th] Tuesday, the day after tomorrow, God willing. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, thank you so much. 
  [Sha'th] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Hasan Abu-Libdah, deputy director </F>
general of PECDAR, by 'Umar Zaydani; place and date not given; 
from the "With the Midday Events" program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Zaydani] Dr. Hasan Abu-Libdah, deputy director 
general of the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and 
Reconstruction [PECDAR]: You returned last night from Paris 
carrying in your pocket $42 million from the donor states. 
  [Abu-Libdah] In fact, we did not come back with $42 million 
in our pocket. We returned with commitments to pay an 
additional $42 million to what was pledged on 27 January 1994. 
  [Zaydani] When will the donor states begin to transfer the 
funds? 
  [Abu-Libdah] Some of them have already started to do this. 
There is a sum of money in the Johan Jorgen Holst Peace Fund. 
We expect additional funds to be transferred this month. 
  [Zaydani] During this month, how much will there be in the 
Holst Fund? 
  [Abu-Libdah] We expect the funds to total $62 million. 
  [Zaydani] Is this the sum you have asked for? 
  [Abu-Libdah] It is part of what we have asked for. We went 
to the Paris conference three days ago having in mind the need 
to cover the $81 million deficit in the budget of the 
Palestinian National Authority [PNA]. We had expected some 
donor states to step forward to cover this deficit. We got $42 
million, however. 
  [Abu-Libdah] Which states have so far contributed funds to 
the PNA? 
  [Abu-Libdah] The big states. The United States has pledged 
an additional $10 million; Japan an additional $9 million; Saudi 
Arabia an additional $10 million; Norway an additional $2 
million; Canada an additional 1 million Canadian dollars; in 
addition to other states that will announce this. Let me 
explain here that these sums are not new pledges; they are a 
redistribution of the previous pledges. In 1994, many nations 
pledged to pay more than $700 million. Of course, not all the 
money will be disbursed in 1994. Based on discussions with these 
nations, it was agreed that some of them will redistribute their 
commitments so that we can cover the deficit. 
  [Zaydani] What are the priorities to which these funds will 
go in the self-rule region? 
  [Abu-Libdah] The first priority, of course, is paying the 
salaries in the public sector, in addition to a variety of 
programs which we deem of priority. These programs will try to 
respond to the requirements of the poorer sections of 
Palestinian society. 
  [Zaydani] Will the funds then be transferred from the Holst 
Fund to a particular Palestinian side, the PLO or another fund? 
  [Abu-Libdah] The Johan Holst Fund is run by the World Bank, 
but it is at the disposal of the Palestinian leadership, which 
will decide where to disburse any sums from this fund. 
  [Zaydani] Another question, if I may. These funds will be 
enough for only several months. 
  [Abu-Libdah] Certainly. We went to the Paris conference, 
and we will go to the next conference on 11 July to demand that 
the deficit in the PNA budget be covered until the end of this 
year. We think that if we manage to lay down the appropriate 
mechanisms to collect Palestinian income in other ways, then we 
will begin 1995, hopefully, with little or no deficit at all. 
  [Zaydani] How will the Palestinians contribute money to the 
PNA through the collection of taxes from Palestinians abroad? 
  [Abu-Libdah] The Palestinians abroad are expected, in 
general, to contribute a great deal to development and 
reconstruction. Palestinian revenues inside the occupied 
territories will definitely not be enough to lay the foundations 
of true economic progress that will enable the private sector to 
operate smoothly. Therefore, we expect our Palestinian brothers 
outside the occupied territories to be the way we know them, to 
invest their funds in the self-rule region and pledge funds to 
allow for progress in economic reconstruction in general. 
  [Zaydani] PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat has made his travel to 
Jericho conditional on receiving aid from the donor countries. 
Has Yasir 'Arafat dropped this demand? 
  [Abu-Libdah] Brother Yasir 'Arafat knows best under what 
conditions he will be able to enter his country. However, I 
believe that brother Yasir 'Arafat will arrive shortly in 
Jericho. 
  [Zaydani] Why this secrecy about his arrival in Jericho? 
  [Abu-Libdah] There are several factors that will determine 
the date of his arrival in Jericho, some of which have to do 
with the arrangements for the transfer of the PLO offices and 
its commitments inside the occupied territories, and some of 
them have a direct relation to the political situation in 
general. 
  [Zaydani] Dr. Hasan Abu-Libdah, thank you very much. 
  [Abu-Libdah] You are welcome.

  [Text] Rafah, 11 Jun (MENA)--Major General 'Abd-al-Raziq 
al-Majayidah, commander of the Palestinian National Security 
Forces, left Rafah today for the self-rule areas at the 
instructions of Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat to acquaint 
himself with the security situation, the deployment of the 
security forces in vital areas and at important installations, 
and to prepare for the arrival in Jericho of 'Arafat and the 
rest of the civilian Authority members. 
  Maj. Gen. al-Majayidah stressed the need for the donor 
nations to provide funds to help the security forces perform 
their duties and establish security and stability in the 
self-rule areas and help the civilian departments to provide 
utilities and infrastructure projects. 
  Economic experts estimate that the civilian authorities will 
need approximately $25 million per month to cover the current 
costs, in addition to the costs of building installations in the 
initial stage of establishing a Palestinian state. 
  Meanwhile, 600 more personnel of the Palestinian National 
Security Forces will arrive in Rafah this evening in preparation 
for entry into the Gaza Strip tomorrow.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report by Samir Sa'd-al-Din from "occupied </F>
Jerusalem"] 
  [Text] Mazin 'Izz-al-Din, official in charge of political 
guidance for the Palestinian police in the Gaza Strip, has said 
that the Palestinian military has taken over police duties 
because it was capable and was ready to take over that authority 
from the political apparatus and that the military would 
continue to exercise that right until the political and civilian 
institutions were prepared to assume that responsibility. 
Therefore, the fear of some brothers in the opposition that the 
military will continue to assume authority and that the role of 
the members of the authority would be confined to administrative 
duties is unfounded. 
  He also said: We are planning to build political and 
civilian institutions and to hold elections for the authority's 
legislative council. 
  He added: Dialogue between the Fatah Movement and Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement] has been going on for a long time, 
and it began even before the arrival of the police in the 
National Authority's area. We are willing to continue that 
dialogue until we reach common ground because we believe that 
the Palestinian police do not belong to one faction but to all 
the Palestinian people's segments and factions. It is true that 
we fought Israel, but this is not allowed among our political 
forces. Now, we are holding a dialogue with Israel, but it is 
more appropriate that we should argue with each other in a 
democratic way. 
  He asserted that we have achieved positive results in our 
dialogue with Hamas and the Islamic Jihad. 
  Referring to the existence of a dialogue with the other 
organizations, he said: We argued with them in Beirut, the 
jungle of rifles; we all reached common ground; we all 
participated in formulating our legislative councils and our 
political frameworks; and we conducted joint patrols. He then 
urged the leftist and pan- Arab forces to exercise their right 
under the warm wings of the Palestinian people and democracy to 
which we all belong. 
  Regarding the alertness of the Palestinian police, 
'Izz-al-Din said that the police forces, which were originally 
Palestinian forces, were properly trained in various countries, 
including West European and East European countries and some 
Arab countries. Several months ago, we sent personnel to the 
United States, Europe, and France, and we will send others to 
Japan and some Arab countries to take courses on administration, 
typography, map drawing, and computer usage. The problem is 
that we do not have the necessary institutions and departments 
for police missions. For example, the policemen do not have 
telecommunications devices to organize work between patrols, 
branches, and centers. 
  Mazin 'Izz-al-Din also said that the Palestinian police have 
actually begun to exercise police missions. For example, they 
asked drivers to keep proper papers for themselves and their 
cars, they have organized visits to beaches in Gaza, and they 
have removed tents and huts on the beaches. 
  The policemen also cleaned the Strip's cities and camps. 
Senior officers and soldiers took part in that work. He said: 
We want opposition factions and organizations to participate 
with us in removing the slogans they have written on walls in 
Gaza. Everyone took part in removing similar slogans in Jericho. 
  Colonel Khalid Mismar, official in charge of information in 
Jordan, who was appointed official in charge of political 
guidance for the Palestinian police in the West Bank, is 
expected to arrive within the next few days.

  [Excerpts] By order of the Palestinian National Authority 
and with Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's approval, the 
first Palestinian military court in the autonomous areas has 
been formed. The court is presided over by lawyer Major Muhammad 
al-Bahri, with lawyers Major Fawzi 'Awdah and lawyer Lieutenant 
Muhammad Abu-Samih as members. Lawyer Lieutenant Colonel Mahmud 
Khalil al-Bashtawi has been appointed public prosecutor and 
representative of the military prosecution. 
  The court opened its first sitting at the military command 
hall in Jericho the day before yesterday with the first military 
case involving Captain Yusuf 'Aytah. On 13 May, a child, 'Ammar 
Rushdi al-Shawwa, age 13, fidgeted with 'Aytah's rifle amid 
popular celebrations to mark the Palestinian security forces 
entry into Jericho, causing the weapon to go off, killing the 
child instantly and injuring his mother and a third person. 
[passage omitted] 
  Lt. Col. al-Bashtawi told AL-DUSTUR that the Palestinian 
military court will rely on Jordanian and Egyptian laws in the 
absence of Palestinian military laws, until Palestinian 
legislation is issued. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Jordan and Israel Tuesday [7 June] signed three 
documents detailing the agenda of negotiations that will lead to 
the signing of a peace treaty. Official sources in Amman said 
the two countries next month will start working out a peace 
agreement after having formed a committee to demarcate their 
joint borders. 
  In a statement to our radio, a spokesman for the unified 
leadership of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine [DFLP] and the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine [PFLP] said the unified leadership of the two fronts 
has warned against the dangers of the Jordanian-Israeli 
agreement and said it opens the door wide for all forms of 
normalization at a time when Israel is still occupying the 
Palestinian and Arab territories, in addition to the fact that 
it is a violation of the principle of a comprehensive solution 
in accordance with international legitimacy, although it is 
hiding behind the first penetration represented by the 
Oslo-Cairo agreement. 
  The central leadership of the two fronts warned against this 
agreement and called on the Jordanian House of Representatives 
and all national Jordanian forces, parties, and personalities to 
reject the agreement and not to allow it to pass on both the 
popular and official levels. The leadership also demanded that 
the Jordanian Government revoke this agreement and abide by the 
principle of comprehensive solution and the constants of the 
pan-Arab position, according to the PFLP and DFLP spokesman.

  [Text] In the Kashmir valley, the two British kidnapped by 
militants continue to be under their captivity despite the 
promises made by the abductors that they will be released at any 
time. The father of the kidnapped 16-year old boy, Mr. David 
Housego, told our Srinagar correspondent that his anxiety is 
increasing because of the attitude of the militants. Relatives 
of the kidnapped persons had even gone to Pahalgam in the hope 
of securing their release, but returned to Srinagar last evening.

  [Text] The home minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan, has said the 
time is not yet ripe for declaring the general amnesty in Jammu 
and Kashmir or lifting the ban on the militant outfit JKLF 
[Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front]. He said the stage for general 
amnesty will come when the center takes a political decision as 
a final solution to the problem. In an interview to PTI, the 
home minister said the Jammu and Kashmir government has already 
been reviewing the cases of release of some of the detenus 
against whom there were no serious charges. Mr. Chavan said he 
will be visiting the state in about a months time to hold public 
meetings in various areas. 
  In Jammu and Kashmir, curfew has been imposed in Bhadarwah 
town of Doda District as a precautionary measure following the 
killing of a youth by the militants this morning. The youth was 
shot dead by the militants while he was going to an adjoining 
locality. 
  Most of the foreign mercenaries in Kashmir are critical of 
Pakistan for misleading them on jihad as they do not find the 
prevailing situation in the valley as such. Two Pakistani 
mercenaries -- Mohammad Ramzan of Faisalabad and Fahadullah of 
Multan told newspersons at Jammu yesterday that Pakistan is 
infiltrating foreign mercenaries into Kashmir for political 
purposes after indoctrinating them in the name of jihad. They 
said there is no danger to Islam in Kashmir. Both of them 
disclosed that the Lahore based (Markaz-e-Dawatul Arshad) and 
the ISI [Inter Services Intelligence] are training Muslims from 
foreign countries for fanning international terrorism in the 
name of jihad.

  [Text] Srinagar 6 June -- Justice Rangnath Mishra, 
chairman of the National Human Rights Commission, has described 
the human rights situation in the Kashmir valley as serious. 
Meanwhile, the state administration, in order to hide its 
shortcomings, did not allow the distressed people to meet the 
commission delegation which arrived in Srinagar today. Mishra 
called for taking immediate steps to attend to the complaints of 
the afflicted people. He said that the National Human Rights 
Commission will send an investigative team to the valley in 
September to look into the complaints of human rights 
violations. The commission members are visiting the state now. 
  Mishra said the commission has received nearly 50 complaints 
about human rights violations in the valley. Of these 
complaints, 14 were sent by mail to the commission in Delhi. 
Twenty-five complainants met him on 5 June in Srinagar. Eight 
complaints were received on 6 June. 
  Mishra said many complaints are against terrorists and 
security forces. Asked whether members of the All Parties 
Freedom Conference and the Kashmir Bar Association met him 
during his two-day stay in Delhi, he said there was no response 
from these organizations even though they were invited through a 
special letter. Mishra said before coming here, the commission 
had asked for reports from the state government about 14 
complaints. About the alleged mass killings in Kupwara, 
Bijbiara and other places, Mishra said large-scale violence has 
been alleged at these places. We will find out the truth, he 
said. He said the government report on the Kupwara incidents in 
January will likely be received on 7 June. It is alleged that 
17 people died from shooting by security forces. 
  Mishra denied that the commission is working on the advice 
of 
the state government. He said the commission is an independent 
body and its programs are worked out independently. He said 
they had come to the valley according to the program worked out 
out by them. Mishra said most of the complaints involve those 
taken away for interrogation by the security forces during their 
raids and search operations and subsequently could not be 
traced. All such matters will be referred to the state 
government, which will present its views before carrying out 
detailed investigations. 
  When Mishra and other members of the commission were asked 
about complaints regarding custodial deaths in Pulwama, Anantnag 
and Kupwara, they said they were unaware of such cases. They 
asked the journalists to provide detailed information in this 
regard so that they can investigate. 
  Asked whether the commission will visit Kupwara, Anantnag, 
Pulwama, Badgam and Baramula, they said they had no such plan. 
At the same time, they said the commission has received a 
complaint from a villager in Kupwara that his brother, who was a 
teacher, was arrested and later killed by the security forces 
near a religious place. 
  Mishra said that a large number of people met the commission 
members, but they were unable to visit some other places in the 
valley to assess the situation correctly. Asked whether the 
commission will visit the valley again in view of the `explosive 
situation' here, he said the commission will first look into the 
complaints received so far and visit the valley again if 
necessary. 
  The commission was formed last year.

  [Text] In a major breakthrough, the Delhi police has 
arrested a Hizbul Mujahideen militant and two of his associates 
who were in the process of establishing a country-wide terrorist 
network. 
  They were trying to carry out their mission with the help of 
fundamentalist organisations in various towns and cities, 
including Delhi. 
  Their objective was to target prominent Kashmiri political 
leaders and spread terror among the general population. 
  Police picked up Mushtaq Ahmed, 28 and his associate 
Khaliq-u-Zaman, 30 on Sunday from near a Mazhar in Adarsh Nagar 
in North West Delhi where the two had rendezvoused. 
  A Chinese pistol with 8 rounds and 4 stick grenades were 
recovered fIom their possession. Another associate, Shahid Anis 
Azmi, 18 was earlier arrested by a team of Delhi Police in 
Bombay from where he was operating for the past few months. 
  Their interrogation revealed that they were on a specific 
mission to establish a terrorist network in metropolitan towns 
by recruiting local Muslim youth who were later trained in arms 
and explosives in Kashmir. 
  An organisation called the Minorities United Front (MUF) had 
been floated by the Hizbul Mujahideen for this purpose in 
December 1992 in the aftermath of the demolition of the disputed 
structure at Ayodhya. 
  Additional police commissioner (CID) R S Gupta said on 
Monday 
that Mushtaq Ahmed, a resident of Anantnag, acting on orders of 
Hizbul Chief Salauddin, was coordinating the search for 
potential Muslim recruits. 
  The entire operation brought into open the hand of 
Pakistan's 
ISI, he added. 
  After having enrolled himself in the Unani Medical College 
in 
Gaya in mid-1993, Ahmed had been visiting various hotbeds of 
fundamentalism in Bihar and UP for identifying Muslim youth. 
  Ahmed contacted various madrasas in Etawah, Muzaffamagar, 
Gaya, Calcutta and Bombay. Cells were set up in these places and 
many youth were taken to Kashmir for training in arms and 
explosives. 
  The objective was to create a team of dedicated youth owing 
allegiance to Hizbul Mujahideen and willing to undertake various 
terrorist activities including the assassination of top 
political leaders connected with Kashmir. 
  According to Gupta, most of the recruits belonged to Muslim 
fundamentalist bodies such as the Students Islamic Movement of 
India (SIMI), Students Islamic Organisation (SIO) and Aljehad, 
organisation active in Western UP. 
  Both Khaliq-u-Zaman and Shahid Anis Azmi were active workers 
of SIMI. Khaliq-u-Zaman, who belongs to Hamirpur in UP, worked 
in the Delhi office of SIMI and joined the MUF around six months 
back. 
  After receiving arms training in Anantnag, he helped recruit 
two boys from Etawah who were also later sent to Kashmir for 
training. Shahid Anis Azmi, who originally hails from Azamgarh 
in UP, was associated with the SIMI office in Bombay and joined 
the MUF in 1993. He had since been helping Ahmed recruit Muslim 
youth. 
  A fourth associate, Assadullah, who is presently in the 
custody of the Calcutta police, also figures as a prominent 
member of the network. 
  Assadullah, who is to be brought to the Capital shortly by 
the Delhi Police, was working for the SIO and had been making 
frequent forays into Bangladesh to create hide-outs there for 
the terrorists to escape after carrying out their mission in the 
country. 
  Ahmed has revealed that at least eight youth had been 
recruited so far from various towns and cities to function as 
agents of the Hizbul Mujahideen. 
  Police officials, however, said the figure could be higher. 
Efforts were on to get more information of the activities of 
Ahmed and his associates from some key documents seized from him. 
  Telephone numbers from an electronic wrist watch which Ahmed 
was wearing at the time of his arrest are also being 
investigated. 
  Ahmed has also revealed that a weapons consignment in two 
trucks had been dispatched from Kashmir to various areas in the 
country. Police were making efforts to locate the destination of 
the consignment. 
  Police officials said that although the group had not 
carried 
out any strike, plans were at an advanced stage for terrorist 
strikes in Delhi and Calcutta and funds in this regard had 
already been distributed. 
  The arrested persons were booked under the Arms Act, 
Explosives Act and TADA and remanded to police custody on 
Monday. Further investigations are on.

  [Text] New Delhi, June 3 (HTC) [HINDUSTAN TIMES 
correspondent] -- Customs officials this morning confiscated a 
consignment of a foreign magazine, which reached the cargo 
terminal's import division from USA, as "it had objectionable 
photographs of Indian flags being burnt". 
  A consignment of about 300 copies of FAR EASTERN ECONOMIC 
REVIEW was confiscated by a customs inspector under the 
supervision of an Assistant Collector Bandana Deori. 
  According to sources in the customs, the weekly magazine 
carried several photographs of mobs burning the Indian flag. 
The decision to confiscate the magazine was taken then and 
there as the magazine issue is a current one. 
  When contacted the customs chief Anand Bordia said there are 
specific government notifications pertaining to a) news items or 
photographs distorting the Indian map b) news or photographs 
which may incite communal passion c) news items or insertions 
which can threaten the country's security and d) obscene 
literature. He said on these grounds the customs is empowered 
to confiscate any literature which is incoming or outgoing. 
  Mr Bordia said whenever such `distortions' are noticed the 
customs sends the matter for opinion to the Ministry of Home 
Affairs [MHA]. In the case of the FAR EASTERN ECONOMIC REVIEW, 
the possible explanation of a quick decision to confiscate it 
was due to lack of time. He said the magazine is a current 
issue and since `abberation' conformed to the GOI [Government of 
India] notifications, the magazines were seized before sending 
the matter to MHA. 
  Sources in the cargo division also informed that a huge 
consignment of another foreign magazine INDIA ABROAD was 
confiscated recently as it has objectionable news reports on the 
situation of the Kashmir Valley. Similarly, a book on Kashmir, 
published from United Kingdom, was also banned entry to India by 
the customs because of alleged inflammatory insertions about 
militant ravaged Valley.

  [Excerpt] According to a report by a Bakhtar Information 
Agency correspondent, recently (?two) people who were exchanging 
counterfeit money in a Kabul bazaar were arrested. Two thousand 
Pakistan rupees and 900 U.S. dollars were seized from them. 
  Mohammad Esmael (?Warsagi), head of the department for the 
campaign against crime, says the aforementioned men confessed 
that the bank notes were put at their disposal by Golboddin's 
party. 
  The report adds that Kabul city moneychangers are concerned 
about counterfeit U.S. dollar and Pakistani rupees and are 
taking great care when dealing with money. 
  It was reported earlier that 10 cartons of paper that are 
used in printing bank notes in Pakistan were intercepted at 
Peshawar airport and were later released when certain secret 
groups intervened. 
  Golboddin, whose propaganda concerning the printing of 
afghani bank notes did not achieve any result, resorted to 
selling men to Azerbaijan in exchange for dollars, in order to 
free himself from economic hardship. This latest action is his 
final instrument in order to accumulate wealth for himself and 
undermine the value of afghanis. 
  Under the condition where Kabul has been reconnected to one 
of the important ports of Afghanistan, and an export route 
between Afghanistan and Central Asia has been opened, the value 
of the afghani is increasing daily. [indistinct passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by News Research and Commentary Group] </F>
  [Text] The foreign minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina arrived 
yesterday in Tehran at the head of a high-level political 
delegation on an official visit. On his arrival in Tehran, he 
attended the Friday prayers and described the Islamic Republic 
of Iran as the best friend of the Bosnian nation. He thanked 
the Iranian people for their assistance to his compatriots. 
  The Islamic Republic of Iran is playing host to the Bosnian 
delegation and this is an indication of the ideological bonds 
between the two Muslim nations of Iran and Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
During the past two years, in which an unjust war in Bosnia- 
Herzegovina has sealed the fate of the defenseless people of 
this Republic, the Islamic Republic of Iran has consistently 
expressed its support for the oppressed people of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and has welcomed the creation of conditions 
for a just peace. 
  At present, the Bosnian crisis is a conspicuous example of a 
struggle that, according to the country's foreign minister, has 
created conducive conditions for the involvement of all the 
progressive European countries as well as the intelligentsia. 
However, as far as the rights of the Bosnian Muslims are 
concerned, there has been nothing but a prejudiced approach and 
a discriminatory policy by the Western echelons. 
  From this vantage point, the unstinting support of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran is a help in healing the sorrows of the 
defenseless Bosnian people and a reliable catalyst for the 
continuation of resistance against the Serb aggressors. In the 
most difficult conditions, the Islamic Republic of Iran has 
risen up in support of the Bosnians and has encountered 
political pressure and restrictions as well as negative 
propaganda from the common enemies of the Muslim peoples of Iran 
and Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The current peace talks in Geneva have not yielded any 
results and are merely being viewed as tactical and political 
moves on the part of Western officials. In any case, it is 
hoped that the relations between the two Muslim nations of Iran 
and Bosnia-Herzegovina, which are based on common cultural 
denominators and Islamic thinking, will broaden in the future 
and that the oppressed Bosnian nation will also be delivered as 
soon as possible from the clutches of injustice prevailing in 
the Balkans.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Dr. 'Ali Akbar Velayati by </F>
al-Sayyid al-Mallah and Ahmad al-Suyufi in Cairo; date not given] 
  [Text] [AL-SHA'B] The question citizens in both Cairo and 
Tehran must hear is what happened in your talks with Egyptian 
Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa? 
  [Velayati] First, we are extremely happy to be in Cairo and 
among the Egyptian people. We attribute great importance to 
Egypt, its people, and its role. We believe that this country 
and people play a major role in the Islamic world--a role no one 
can deny, ignore, or forget. It is an important, historic, and 
pivotal role, not only in Egypt, but throughout the whole 
Islamic world. 
  [AL-SHA'B] But we would like to know what happened during 
the meeting. Was the issue of restoring ties to normal 
discussed? 
  [Velayati] If you mean the establishment of official 
diplomatic ties, this was not discussed during the meeting, 
which lasted one whole hour. However, what was discussed during 
the meeting was everything that has to do with joint cooperation 
between the two countries in international forums. In addition, 
we discussed all the international issues of interest to the two 
countries, such as Palestine, the war in Yemen, and the future 
of the Nonaligned Movement and the Islamic Conference 
Organization. 
  [AL-SHA'B] Do you have any specific ideas on restoring 
relations to normal? 
  [Velayati] Undoubtedly, this requires action to reach joint 
agreement, eliminate all suspicions, and remove misconceptions 
on both sides. 
  [AL-SHA'B] Could we say there was some progress at this 
meeting, or that it had some positive results? 
  [Velayati] Of course some progress was made. And of course 
some positive points emerged. It is enough for me to tell you 
this: I have been foreign minister of Iran for 13 years (since 
1981) and this is my first visit to Egypt. My mere presence in 
Egypt is a good and positive step. I can confirm to you that 
our discussions were constructive and positive. During the 
meeting, we affirmed both countries' desire to start good 
bilateral cooperation in the international arena. 
  [AL-SHA'B] Now we come to the most thorny issue, the 
long-standing accusation that the Islamic Republic of Iran is 
exporting terrorism to the Islamic World, and even around the 
world. What do you have to say about this accusation? 
  [Velayati] This is not new; Iran is not the first country to 
be accused of such things. During the 'Abd-al-Nasir era, Egypt 
itself was subjected to such accusations. 
  This is an old weapon the West uses to put pressure on 
countries, especially those who refuse to submit to the control 
of the Western powers. None of those who have leveled this 
accusation can actually prove it. It is no more than dangling 
the sword of Damocles over the heads of those who go against 
Western and Zionist views. Notice, for example, that yesterday 
Israel carried out bestial raids on the al-Biqa' Valley in 
Lebanon, killing and injuring many people. I heard one of the 
Israeli officials tell the London radio about this raid, saying 
there is a batch of terrorists whom they have gone to kill. 
Killing people falls into the realm of terrorism. Israel 
kidnapped Mustafa al-Dirani from among his own children, and 
then said he is a terrorist. Those who kidnap people from their 
homes, terrorize them, and kill other people are the ones 
accusing the kidnapped and dead of being terrorists. The killer 
and kidnapper who is practicing all kinds of terrorism is not 
being accused of terrorism. The Mustafa al-Dirani crime is a 
peculiar one. Previously a batch of Israeli planes raided 
Lebanon and it happened that one of the planes was downed and 
the Israeli pilot captured. When the pilot was handed back, 
al-Dirani was the one who handed him over, so he was accused of 
having captured the pilot and was kidnapped. Who can claim that 
one person is a terrorist and another person is not? It is a 
strange game they use to gain control over countries. Praise be 
to God this game has been exposed. 
  [AL-SHA'B] If there are good intentions to improve ties 
between Iran and the Arab world, there are obstacles blocking 
the way, including the disputed islands with the United Arab 
Emirates [UAE]. Why don't we start by looking for a solution to 
this crisis? 
  [Velayati] It is historically documented that these islands 
belong to Iran, and we have the documents to prove it. We are 
ready to send them to anyone who wants to see them. So why is 
this issue being used as a pretext to stir up trouble with the 
brothers by others, who are always lying in wait for us and are 
never short of ways to do so. We want to stress, through your 
paper, that we are ready to sit down with the UAE to negotiate 
in accordance with the 1971 agreement. I personally visited the 
UAE last year, met with His Highness Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan, 
and held good talks with him. We also met with his son, His 
Highness Shaykh Hamdan, and the foreign minister, whom we 
invited to visit Tehran, but he has not done so yet. So what 
else could we have done? I went there personally and the 
natural thing was for him to reciprocate the visit. I hereby, 
through your paper, renew my invitation to him; and I hope he 
will respond to it, because dialogue is the only way to resolve 
our problems. Let met tell you about another incident. When we 
were attending the nonaligned meeting in Jakarta with President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani, [UAE foreign minister] Rashid 'Abdallah 
said: His Highness Shaykh Zayid asks you as Iranian officials 
to adopt an appropriate stand and to act more appropriately 
regarding the issue of the Abu-Musa islands. President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani immediately ordered us to send the director 
general of the Iranian Foreign Ministry to discuss the Abu-Musa 
issue. I immediately contacted him and we sent him to Abu-Musa 
the same day. Rashid 'Abdallah told us that he was very pleased 
about what we did. The director general of our ministry took 
several measures to eliminate the problem. On his way back he 
stopped over at the nearby Bandar-e 'Abbas to take the plane 
back to Tehran, but he was surprised to hear of a Gulf 
Cooperation Council statement denouncing Iran. For the record, 
Shaykh Rashid 'Abdallah was not present when the statement was 
issued. 
  [AL-SHA'B] We want to know your precise position regarding 
the Gaza-Jericho Agreement? 
  [Velayati] Our position now is the same as our position 
before and our permanent position, which rejects any agreements 
with the Zionists. 
  [AL-SHA'B] You have good ties with Syria, so what would you 
do if Syria concluded a peace agreement with Israel? Would this 
affect your relations? 
  [Velayati] We are against any agreement with Israel by any 
party. This does not mean that we are not aware of the kind of 
pressure to which Syria is being subjected by all sides. 
Suffice it to mention here the numerous campaigns directed 
against Lebanon, Syria's closest neighbor. If such agreements 
were signed, naturally it would affect our bilateral relations. 
We still consider Syria the only major country left to confront 
Israeli domination. 
  [AL-SHA'B] We would like to learn about current relations 
between you and Iraq. The Egyptian public is wondering why you 
and Iraq do not settle the pending problems between you, since 
you are both Islamic nations. Topping these pending issues is 
the issue of the POW's and the aircraft you are holding in Iran. 
Iraq still accuses you of treating it harshly. What do you have 
to say about all of this? 
  [Velayati] Our viewpoint is the exact opposite of the Iraqi 
viewpoint. Regarding the Iraqi aircraft we are holding, this 
matter is governed by the Security Council resolutions. 
Internationally, we are not authorized to return them. We 
cannot violate Security Council resolutions. The problem will 
be resolved within its own framework. Moreover, we are not the 
only ones who have Iraqi aircraft in their possession. There 
are some planes in other countries--Jordan, for example. 
  Regarding the prisoners, we say the same thing that Iraq 
says. We have a mutual problem. They have our prisoners and we 
have theirs. We believe that there should be a bilateral 
exchange of prisoners. For your information, an Iranian 
delegation will visit Iraq on 11 June. A month after that I 
will visit Iraq myself. A few days ago I met with the Iraqi 
foreign minister; we have frequent meetings. We are great 
advocates of the belief that everything can be achieved through 
dialogue and meetings. 
  [AL-SHA'B] We are puzzled by your stand regarding the 
Kashmir issue and what is being said about your stand against 
the Muslims. What is your real stand on this matter? 
  [Velayati] I wish to confirm to the two of you that not a 
single Islamic or non-Islamic country has cooperated more with 
Pakistan over the Kashmir issue. You can ask Pakistan if you 
wish; we challenge you to find a country that has done one-third 
as much as us. 
  [AL-SHA'B] Undoubtedly, you have made contributions on the 
Bosnia issue. But the Islamic world expected you in particular 
to take a more effective and influential stand than you have 
taken so far. Why have you taken such a stand? 
  [Velayati] I was in Sarajevo last month. I do not wish to 
tell you what we did there, but I will quote public statements 
by President Alija Izetbegovic to correspondents: All aspects 
of the Iranian role in Bosnia will go down in history. Had it 
not been for Iran, Bosnia would not be in the condition we see 
it in today. Iran has so far provided many forms of aid. It 
has also made a proposal to give military aid. 
  Velayati then added: A few days ago, THE WASHINGTON POST 
published an article in which it confirmed that Iranian planes 
had transported shipments of arms to Bosnia. Irrespective of 
the truth of this report, we do is not rule out this kind of 
undertaking in dealing with Bosnia, where we have seen forms of 
ugliness unknown to us before. 
  [AL-SHA'B] Before we end this dialogue, we wish to learn 
about your stand on what you call the state of the "great 
Satan."? 
  [Velayati] Our stand on the great Satan is the same. It has 
not changed. It is the same old stand. There is nothing new in 
it. We have no objections to establishing cordial relations with 
any party on condition that that party respects our causes and 
does not support our enemies.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati </F>
by unidentified correspondent; date not given; from the 
"Political Roundtable" program -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Your Excellency, Mr. Velayati: 
Once again I thank you for taking part in the program. As my 
first question, the concluding statement of the session of the 
foreign ministers of the member countries of the Nonaligned 
Movement [NAM] has stressed a number of points that show the 
movement's political activity. Before the recent session, the 
inactivity of the NAM raised a number of questions pertaining to 
the survival of the movement. Why did such activity take the 
form that it took? 
  [Velayati] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate, I greet the dear viewers and thank you for 
preparing this program. I should mention that your view is 
correct. That is, during a period after the collapse of the 
former Soviet Union and the so-called eastern camp, the NAM 
became confused for a while. As you mentioned, some people were 
doubtful about the continuation of an active life for the 
movement. [passage omitted] 
  During the recent Cairo session, as you mentioned, we saw a 
revival of the NAM. South Africa is the most significant 
African country, with its revolution against apartheid having 
recently succeeded and with a particular credibility throughout 
the world. South Africa's membership in the NAM and the active 
participation of its foreign minister in the Cairo session is a 
good sign of the revival of the NAM. The active participation 
of the foreign minister of Bosnia is the same. Also various 
other activities, which we will mention, all indicate that the 
movement is active. Active countries of the Third World -- 
revolutionary countries that have problems with the West and the 
current system that rules the world -- all speak about the fact 
that people have regained their optimism for the NAM. 
  [Correspondent] Numerous international issues were discussed 
by the movement, including a discussion on the Zionist regime. 
Would you please give some explanation on this? 
  [Velayati] The stance of NAM regarding the Zionist regime is 
a special stance, which has been so from the beginning. It 
began in 1358 [year beginning 21 March 1979], when the Islamic 
Republic of Iran joined the NAM, and has continued up to the 
present. I can tell you, the movement's stance regarding the 
Palestine issue has remained virtually unchanged. The NAM 
members have always laid emphasis on the implementation of the 
UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. Those resolutions 
do not mean the liberation of all of the occupied territories 
but require, or, rather, guarantee the liberation of those 
territories that were occupied in the 1967 war. Naturally, we 
opposed that thinking, but I can tell you that in the movement 
we have been almost alone in this regard from the beginning. 
  The decision-making method in the movement is such that if 
90 
or more percent of the movement members agree on an issue and 
several states oppose it, then that issue is adopted and the 
states opposing it declare their reservation. Regarding 
Palestine, in the past, whether at the summit sessions -- where 
the honorable President Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani; Engineer Musavi, 
former Islamic Republic of Iran prime minister; and the exalted 
leader [Khamene'i], when he held the presidency, took part -- or 
at the foreign ministers' gatherings, the NAM stance concerning 
Palestine has always been different from that of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran. Therefore, they used to make a decision and 
we would declare our reservation. Not even once did they adopt a 
position that would coincide with the position we sought -- 
neither there, nor at the Islamic Conference Organization 
sessions, nor at the UN. 
  [Correspondent] You referred to Bosnia. What action and 
what coordination was undertaken in this regard? 
  [Velayati] It was the first time that the NAM unanimously 
adopted a resolution prepared by the IRI and Malaysia. It was 
first proposed by Malaysia after consultations with us. The 
session decided that the IRI and Malaysia should consult with 
each other and prepare a text. That is what we did and 
presented to the movement, and latter adopted it. That is the 
first time that a decisive stance has been taken in favor of 
Bosnia and against the Serbs, taking into account the fact that 
the Serbs consider themselves the inheritors of the former 
Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia was one of the founders of NAM and some 
of the older members of the movement had reservations regarding 
a condemnation of Serbia and Montenegro, or, as they called it, 
Yugoslavia Minor. But in the resolution the stance of the NAM 
movement was almost the same as that of the IRI and that was a 
positive development. 
  [Correspondent] The final statement of the NAM foreign 
ministers' session also considered issues such as disarmament, 
human rights and the environment. Would you make a statement on 
that? 
  [Velayati] I must say that the issues you referred to, that 
is disarmament, human rights and the environment, are several 
important issues at world level, especially in recent years. 
And the United Nations convenes independent sessions in 
connection with those important international issues or attached 
to others or other subjects [as heard]. If the states do not 
coordinate with each other -- third world states or developing 
states -- the wishes of the Western states or the permanent 
member states of the Security Council will be imposed on them. 
Among the IRI policies, whether in the Islamic Conference 
Organization [ICO] or in NAM, one is to coordinate these 
important international issues in those two organizations so 
that it can have the support of other states for those issues at 
commissions, committees, and forums where they are raised. 
  In the ICO we pioneered the human rights plan when it held a 
session in Pakistan, and following that the foreign ministry 
deputy for international affairs became the head of the 
Asia-Oceania human rights committee and the latter made 
decisions despite the presence of some states that supported the 
West. And that committee showed a great deal of efficiency, 
especially in the Vienna session. In the Vienna session the 
situation was such that Mr. Carter, the former U.S. president, 
was booed by those non-governmental organizations which had 
gathered there for human rights. And they failed to realize 
their points of view, which they intended to impose, because of 
the resistance of Iran and several other states. This time round 
we propagated that move into the NAM movement. And what was 
adopted there was almost what we had proposed in the specific 
committee. And that was a very good victory. That means that 
in international forums, those places where human rights are 
raised, 109 member states of the NAM movement have virtually the 
same stances and the crucial point which is common for all of us 
-- that common view has been achieved gradually. Some may have 
been -- perhaps under Western pressure -- against human rights 
in various countries being defined according to the traditions, 
values, and beliefs of those countries and communities, rather 
than being formed on the basis of Western beliefs which are 
mainly secular beliefs and are imposed on the rest of the world. 
That was good progress regarding human rights; and was adopted 
there. 
  Regarding disarmament the view of the movement is summarized 
in this sentence -- which is the same as our view. We are for 
disarmament, but against discrimination. It is not right that 
in the Middle East or various areas countries should be 
prohibited from possessing arms which are effective for their 
defense, while the arsenals of some countries -- which are the 
apples of their eyes, so to speak -- are brimming with nuclear, 
chemical, and conventional arms. That is not right. We are 
definitely against weapons of mass destruction but we ask why 
there should be discrimination in favor of some. Israel is a 
case in point. It is said that Israel has 800 nuclear weapons 
in its arsenals. That is the view of the NAM movement which 
coincides with our point of view. I was the person who first 
mooted that issue in the movement, in my speech. The rest 
followed suit and eventually it was adopted in a proper form. 
  [Correspondent] Also the issue of restructuring the system 
of 
international relations and the UN system was discussed. Which 
country raised the issue and, in principle, what does it entail? 
  [Velayati] Essentially the restructuring of the United 
Nations is being raised in all states, the international arena 
and the UN itself. Recently the U.S. President, in his visit to 
Europe, said that they support Japan and Germany's permanent 
membership in the Security Council. That in itself is, in 
reality, a disclosure about a part of a plan to restructure the 
United Nations. Then that issue, in its general form, is being 
raised in the whole of the international arena and all the 
states and all have come to believe that after the passing of 
about 50 years since the formation of the United Nations a 
restructure must be carried out. But debates differ as to how 
that restructuring should be. As developing countries and 
members of the NAM movement, we believe that a special place 
must be allocated to us in the United Nations so that these 
states can put forward, as well as implement, their point of 
view there. 
  [Correspondent] I have another question to ask your 
excellency and that concerns the venue of the NAM foreign 
ministerial session. Why did the NAM choose Egypt as the venue 
for its 11th session? 
  [Velayati] The choice of the country is based on a proposal 
made by a country that wishes to host the session followed by 
the approval of the NAM member countries. It does not work like 
this -- that the NAM decides to transfer the venue of the 
session to a certain country. Usually a country offers, and the 
offer is discussed and approved by the NAM. Egypt was also one 
of those countries; perhaps it was the only country that nearly 
the majority of the NAM members agreed upon as the location for 
the session. 
  [Correspondent] What was the reason for the Iranian 
delegation attending the recent session, bearing in mind that 
some people believe that perhaps the issue of Iran's relations 
with Egypt was also on the agenda? 
  [Velayati] I should mention that attending international 
sessions that are held at a certain country does not necessarily 
mean endorsing that country. Or it does not mean that efforts 
are underway to establish relations with that country, that is, 
if no relations exist. This is the international norm. Today 
so many international sessions take place in various parts of 
the world that this matter does not apply any more. If a 
country takes part in a session somewhere we cannot blame it for 
something that does not exist, unless, of course, other signals 
have been given. 
  We are members of more than 400 international organizations. 
Every day the officials from the Islamic Republic take part in 
meetings in one or several places in the world. This was not 
the first time that we took part in an international 
organization in Cairo. 
  The best example that supports this policy and shows that 
this policy existed in the past in the Islamic Republic -- 
whether at the time of the Imam, may he be admitted to God's 
paradise, or whether at the time of the esteemed leader 
[Khamene'i] -- that we take part in international organizations 
wherever they are held, with the exception of Israel; the best 
example for this is America. We go to New York to take part in 
the United Nations. Even more glaring than that, our economic 
and banking officials go to Washington to take part in the 
meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. 
Our presence in Washington to take part in the World Bank does 
not necessarily mean that we wish to establish relations with 
America. 
  Additionally, do the officials of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs not know that such sensitive political decisions would 
especially require the complete confirmation of the system? 
What policy do we wish to advance by doing this, or what are we 
trying to prevent? So, certainly, there has been no such 
intention. 
  These were some preliminary points in our discussion. 
However, on whether we should or should not take part in the 
Nonaligned Movement meeting even if it is in Egypt -- we 
certainly should take part. Today, everybody admits that we are 
one of the five or six most active members of the Nonaligned 
Movement. Our presence in the Nonaligned Movement is very 
decisive. I have enumerated some of the decisions that were 
adopted there as the result of the efforts of the Islamic 
Republic, and there are more cases. 
  In our absence, others will definitely not adopt policies 
that are in our interest. Whether we are present or not, the 
Nonaligned Movement will hold its session there. They will 
reach their decisions in our absence, but without taking our 
views into consideration. How would it be possible that we 
waste the results of our efforts over many years in the 
Nonaligned Movement through nonparticipation in these meetings? 
I should say that we cannot be absent from these meetings at 
the foreign ministers' level, which are held every three years 
and which perform a very basic role. 
  There have been these reasons. Therefore, the holy system of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran decided to take part in the 
Nonaligned Movement at the level of foreign minister, and we 
were authorized to take part. Of course, our own consultative 
view was also in support of this decision, but the final 
decisions on these sensitive issues regarding foreign policy do 
not rest with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. There are hardly 
any other areas in the decision-making process of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran that so much attention is paid to the decisions 
that are adopted. The source that adopts the basic lines of the 
foreign policy of Iran is definitely the highest decision-making 
source, which ultimately is approved by the esteemed leader. 
  [Announcer tries to interrupt, but Velayati continues] 
Therefore, it was the decision of the system that we should take 
part in the movement. It is also the decision of the system 
that we should even have international cooperation with Egypt. 
This decision had also been adopted in the past and it was 
reaffirmed and restated on the eve of the last session of the 
Nonaligned Movement. 
  Our presence in Egypt did not in any way mean the 
establishment of diplomatic relations. We had no such 
intentions. Our government is sincere with its people, and it 
informs the people about what it decides. The decision of our 
government, of the system of the Islamic Republic of Iran, was 
not to establish relations with Egypt by going there. As his 
excellency the president said in his remarks a few days ago, the 
decision was that we should take part in the meeting of the 
Nonaligned Movement. Let me add this -- and this has not been 
said before -- that we have been both allowed and indeed tasked 
to work with Egypt in the field of international activities. 
  [Correspondent] One of the issues mentioned in the final 
communique was the issue of Iraq. In the near future you will 
be visiting Iraq. Will the decisions taken by the NAM be 
discussed during this visit or not? 
  [Velayati] I should say that it is not definite that my 
visit 
will take place in the near future; but it is highly probable 
that it will be in the near future. The main aim behind the 
visit to Iraq is to remove some of the difficulties which exist 
in our relations. Some of the paragraphs of UN Resolution 598 
have not yet been implemented, or have not been implemented 
fully. We must continue our talks with Iraq, so that the 
paragraphs which have either not been implemented or which have 
been partly implemented will be implemented or will be fully 
implemented. 
  At the same time, these visits and talks will definitely 
result in improving relations between Iran and Iraq. One of the 
areas where we can cooperate with Iraq is definitely on the 
international stage and on the stage of the NAM. At the moment, 
Iraq's stance regarding the issue of Palestine is close to the 
stance of the Islamic Republic, based on what I heard and 
witnessed from their foreign minister in the recent session of 
the NAM. 
  [Correspondent] There are many other questions on Lebanon, 
on 
Yemen, and on the next NAM summit meeting and its venue, but as 
time is short I will leave them for now. If you wish to briefly 
say something in the form of summing up please do so. 
  [Velayati] I should say that today the national interests of 
the countries can be threatened from outside their borders much 
more than before. Therefore, it is the duty of governments, 
including our duty as those serving the holy order of the 
Islamic Republic, to reduce, diminish, or eliminate these 
threats as much as we can through our efforts. 
  Today, the international scene is the most important arena 
for reaching decisions for or against various countries. What 
is happening to Iraq today, what has happened to Libya, the 
pressure which is being exerted over North Korea, what took 
place in Bosnia, what happened in Somalia, the decisions on all 
of those were taken almost entirely on the international arena. 
If they wish to exert pressure on the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
today it is very unlikely that this can be done on a bilateral 
basis. What will be done will be on the international scene. 
  Our people quite rightly expect the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs to be present on the international stage and to defend 
the rights of the Islamic Republic of Iran. If we sit in the 
Islamic Republic and through various excuses refuse to attend 
various international organizations -- at times, some of these 
excuses which are recommended to us by certain circles are also 
very childish -- and if we are content with merely issuing 
statements...[pauses] If our Ministry of Foreign Affairs does 
not take part in, for instance, the nonaligned meeting, or the 
UN session, or the ICO session, each of them due to a different 
reason -- the ICO because it was held in Jeddah, the nonaligned 
meeting because it was held in Cairo, or such and such a UN 
conference has been held in some part of Europe -- if we say 
that due to this we will not attend them; if instead of going 
there, making an effort, accepting some risks, and fighting 
against conspiracies, we sit here and only issue very 
strongly-worded statements, such statements will definitely have 
no credibility on the international stage. 
  Definitely, our people would not be happy with that. The 
people wish the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to be active. They 
would like the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to find a way through 
the maze of the complex problems and difficulties and through 
all the interrelated and complicated difficulties and obstacles 
which exist in the present world, and which are specially 
imposed on us by our enemies. They would like us to find a way 
out of this maze and to resolve the problems. 
  Of course, it is much more difficult for us to be present in 
international organizations and to make efforts to take one step 
in the interest of the Islamic Republic, rather than sit inside 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and issue statements. Issuing 
statements and adopting harsh positions will not be very 
difficult for us, or for the employees of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs. What is hard is to be present in international 
arena, it is to go to the centers of danger. 
  We will certainly take risks to advance our foreign policy. 
See, right now, the deputy minister of foreign affairs is in 
Afghanistan. At the moment, there is no other ambassador in 
Kabul except the ambassador of the Islamic Republic. Our 
embassy has been razed to the ground and our ambassador is 
living in a shelter. At the height of the crisis in Beirut our 
ambassador or charge d'affaires was there. The third embassy 
which was opened in Sarajevo was the embassy of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran. To go to those places is to face danger. 
Nevertheless, we will accept these dangers with open arms if we 
can untie a knot from the problems of the people. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Velayati, thank you for giving us your 
time.

  [Excerpts] Mohammad Va'ezi, Iran's deputy foreign minister 
in charge of Euro-American affairs, participated in a Paris news 
conference at the end of his three-day official trip to France, 
in which he discussed the outcome of his discussions with French 
officials. 
  This is the first time, since Mr. Edouard Balladur came to

  Speaking on his discussions with his French counterpart, Mr. 
Va'ezi said: The topics of discussion in these meetings included 
important regional and international issues, in particular the 
situations of Afghanistan, Tajikistan, central Asia, Iraq, 
Persian Gulf, and Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as relations 
between Iran and the European Union, and the two sides explained 
their views on each topic. 
  Our country's deputy foreign minister said that the issue of 
rescheduling the two country's debts was among topics discussed 
with French officials, in particular the head of the treasury, 
and everything is now almost ready for the two countries to 
solve standing issues in the next few weeks, and that an Iranian 
delegation will soon travel to Paris for final talks regarding 
this issue.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Meeting of NATO's Foreign </F>
Ministers in Turkey"] 
  [Text] The foreign ministers of 16 member states of the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO, concluded its one-day 
meeting in Istanbul, Turkey. At this meeting the NATO foreign 
ministers discussed various issues faced by this treaty. 
  One of the most important issues which was discussed was 
Russia's cooperation with NATO. Based on the final statement of 
this meeting, NATO's foreign ministers agreed to have closer 
ties with Russia. However, by announcing their (?definite terms 
they) rejected some of Russia's demands, including having a 
special status in return for the West's military coalition. The 
Russian officials insist on having special relations with NATO 
which reflect the situation of that country as a major power in 
the world. To this end Moscow has called for the formation of a 
consultative system on every issue which comes up urgently. In 
addition, Moscow has called for cooperation among the members of 
NATO in the former Warsaw and the Soviet republics. [sentence as 
heard] This cooperation is carried out in the form of an 
independent organization which is charged with common 
politico-military cooperation to stop armed clashes. In return 
NATO members have announced readiness for unofficial talks with 
Russia. However, since they do not want all NATO operations to 
be supervized by Russia they have opposed Moscow's proposal on 
authorizing Russia to take part in NATO's internal talks. 
  Political analysts believe since Russia knows that the main 
objective behind participation (?in the) peace plan, which has 
been brought up by the United States, is to create a security 
belt around Russia so as to make necessary preparations against 
Russia's probable danger in case communists come to power again. 
Although Russia considers this plan as against its national 
security it is forced to join it to maintain its influence in 
the East and in the former Soviet republics, for the East 
European countries have voluntarily joined this plan, and even 
if Russia opposes it these European countries will not change 
their decisions. Therefore, Moscow, by taking part in the peace 
plan, tries to push the programs of this plan toward a direction 
which does not endanger Russia's interests at least. 
  The NATO foreign ministers too are quite aware of this 
viewpoint. Hence by accepting some of Russia's demands they 
oppose those proposals by Moscow which can create problems for 
the future of the NATO.

  [Text] Tehran, June 8, IRNA -- A morning daily here 
Wednesday editorialized on the new pricing scheme saying that 
the plan will be successful if it is implemented with the least 
degree of government interference and if the consumers 
themselves perform the role of the controllers. The compulsory 
use of price tags on articles is an effective way of bringing 
some order in the market and it is being used for this purpose 
all over the world, TEHRAN TIMES wrote. 
  The doubtful aspects of the present government scheme begin 
at the stage where the government apparently intends to assume 
an active role in determining prices, the daily said adding that 
this part of the scheme seems to be its least practicable 
aspect. As long as we have not reached a balanced economy and 
our production and distribution systems have not evolved into a 
coherent network, the practice of requiring producers to observe 
constant prices for any length of time would have very little 
chance of success, the article stressed. 
  It further noted that another aspect of the scheme which 
deserves close examination is the supervisory role assigned to 
the Commerce Ministry and in particular to the association of 
guilds and is obviously in conflict with the role assigned to 
the consumers in the same scheme. 
  In a guided free market economy such as now prevails in our 
society, the use of price tags could be useful only in 
regulating the market and enforces some sort of uniformity of 
prices in various part of a single city, the article said. But 
when the government decides to have an active role in 
determining prices, then the scheme will meet overt and hidden 
resistance from producers and distributors, it added. It 
concluded by saying that for this reason it is doubtful whether 
direct government role in price determination can produce any 
beneficial results for the economy.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri by </F>
correspondents Assane Diop and Dominique de Courcelles at the 
OAU summit in Tunis; date not given; from the "Afrique Soir" 
program -- recorded] 
  [Text] Our guest on "Afrique Soir" this evening is Algerian 
Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri. Interviewed by Assane 
Diop and Dominique de Courcelles, he began by speaking of 
relations and cooperation between Sub-Saharan Africa and the 
Arab world: 
  [Dembri] We currently face the problems that are thrown up 
by 
the transition to a market economy and the bringing together of 
our potentialities in order to build up economic 
complementarity; this will ensure that, in the future, Africa 
and even the Arab world will be able to talk on an equal footing 
with the developed world. This is not just our own conclusion: 
The European Union, which is for us the closest pole of 
development, is pushing us toward economic integration. 
  [Correspondent] As concerns bilateral relations between 
Algeria and some of its African neighbors, you have, in 
particular, intervened on the problem of the Tuareg refugees 
from Mali. You recently held a new series of meetings. Where 
at present do things stand on the return of the Malian refugees? 
Algeria is playing a major role in this issue, as most of the 
refugees are on Algerian territory. 
  [Dembri] If you take the problem of displaced persons in 
Algeria, we do indeed have some 40,000 Malian refugees in the 
south of the country. We are trying to make their lives 
somewhat easier, as best we can, by contributing our own 
facilities, and also making use of aid from international 
organizations, from some countries also, including France, in 
order to make sure that these people do not feel completely 
abandoned. 
  [Correspondent] Will you encourage their return, because we 
know that the program has been seriously delayed? 
  [Dembri] Absolutely. There are always difficulties, which 
flow primarily from the primary difficulty, which is that of 
transport-- we are talking about enormous distances, arid or 
semi-arid regions; there is also the problem of the dispersion 
of these displaced persons. I think that we are trying to do 
something. 
  [Correspondent] Algeria is currently weighed down by its 
internal problems, and in particular, by the security problem 
and the lack of dialogue between the government and the Islamic 
militants. What can Algeria expect from an OAU [Organization of 
African Unity] summit, and from other African nations as far as 
this problem is concerned? 
  [Dembri] It is true that we may have a few hotbeds of 
insecurity in Algeria. It is true that there is some terrorist 
activity, but there is a momentum of political dialogue that is 
beginning to pick up speed, and this movement is irreversible. 
The transition platform enabled the opening of political talks 
to all the children of Algeria--all of them, without any 
exceptions. 
  [Correspondent] Including the extremist armed Islamic 
fundamentalists? 
  [Dembri] All the children of Algeria. We just have to 
realize that political dialogue can only work through the 
peaceful confrontation of ideas. 
  [Correspondent] So the OAU could do something? 
  [Dembri] The OAU can quite simply address the general 
problems of transition: I mean that we cannot achieve in a few 
years what the Western world took two centuries to achieve. 
Consequently, this transition must be accompanied in a 
responsible way by the surrounding countries, because it is 
quite clear that situations of instability here will lead to 
instability elsewhere. There is a kind of cosolidarity that 
must develop, which must emerge from this forum.

  [Text] Cairo, 11 Jun (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak has 
received a message from King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, monarch of 
Saudi Arabia and custodian of the two holy mosques. The 
message, dealing with bilateral ties and the continuing 
coordination between the two leaders over matters related to the 
current Arab situation, was delivered by Saudi Foreign Minister 
Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal, who arrived in Cairo earlier today. 
  After the meeting, Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal said that Egypt 
and 
Saudi Arabia are very concerned about stopping the fighting in 
Yemen. He said events in that country are very critical, 
declaring: We are devoting our efforts and energies to ensure a 
successful cease-fire for the good of all parties. 
  Regarding north Yemen's noncompliance with the UN Security 
Council resolution to observe a cease-fire, al-Faysal said that 
continued fighting hinders everything and does not merely hurt 
Yemen but its neighboring Arab countries as well. 
  Remarking that the wish to end the fighting in Yemen is 
shared by all the Arab countries, he voiced hope that this wish 
will find a favorable response, particularly during the current 
mission of the UN secretary general's envoy there. 
  Asked about the Gulf Cooperation Council's [GCC] position on 
the Yemeni crisis, the Saudi Foreign minister referred to the 
GCC statement on the issue and explained that its stance is 
clear. The GCC believes that continued fighting will force the 
GCC countries to adopt measures against the party that refuses 
the cease-fire. He said: Let us give the UN envoy a chance to 
make some efforts in this matter.

  [Text] Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri emphasized in Sidon 
this afternoon that the continuing Israeli aggression against 
Lebanon's territory, sovereignty, and dignity, whether involving 
villages, individuals, or groups, will not force Lebanon to 
conclude a separate peace deal with Israel or even to discuss 
it. They will not succeed in putting on a collision course the 
logic of the state and the logic of the honest, rational, and 
objective resistance, which complements the work of the state 
for liberation by its steadfastness, he added. 
  The prime minister added that we will not give Israel the 
satisfaction of seeing any crack in the unity of the Lebanese, 
who on the contrary are tending toward more strength, cohesion, 
and firmness. Prime Minister al-Hariri reiterated that Lebanon 
joined the negotiations in collaboration and consultation with 
Syria and with a well-known objective--namely, to liberate every 
inch in the south, the Western al-Biqa', and the Golan. 
  Prime Minister al-Hariri made these remarks after 
inaugurating the municipality offices in Sidon.

  [Text] A responsible source at the Presidential Council in 
the Democratic Republic of Yemen made the following statement to 
the Yemeni News Agency, Aden: 
  We have heard about a so-called initiative from 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih presented by his envoy al-Ashtal [as heard] to 
the United Nations which stipulates for a cease-fire as from 
midnight this evening, and commissions what he called a Joint 
Military Committee, formed during the union period which has 
been blown up by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, to examine the situation. 
  We would like to illustrate clearly the position of the 
Democratic Republic of Yemen in the following manner: 
  First, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his forces were those who 
started the aggression on the Democratic Republic of Yemen's 
forces and territories. 
  Second, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his regime have rejected 
all 
Arab and international initiatives. 
  Third, the Security Council has issued its resolution No. 
924 
and we had sincerely announced our adherence to it immediately 
after it was announced, but 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his regime 
clearly refused to abide by this resolution until yesterday when 
he announced his adherence to its text and spirit and specified 
3 o'clock in the evening for the start of implementing the 
ceasefire, though the resolution has stipulated for adherence to 
it and though 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has previously announced two 
cease-fires which he violated. 
  Fourth, for the third time 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his 
forces violated the ceasefire last night. The whole world knows 
that it was he who violated the cease-fire half-an-hour after 
the time he committed himself to cease the firing. 
  Fifth, we shall continue to adhere to the rulings of the 
Security Council's Resolution No. 924 without preconditions, and 
will only defend ourselves against any violation or aggression 
by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his forces. 
  Sixth, the Joint Military Committee or a Yemeni military 
committee, which 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih claims to have set up 
perviously, do not exist any more. International observers, not 
imaginary committees formed by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, should 
monitor the cease-fire. 
  This the position of the Democratic Republic of Yemen which 
it adheres to and announces to the international community.

<F P=106> [Report by Salwa al-Ustuwani: "Damascus: Washington's </F>
Problem in the Middle East Is With Itself First and Israel 
Second"] 
  [Text] Damascus -- Syria said yesterday that the United 
States' problem in the Middle East lies with itself first and 
Israel second. And if the United States is playing its role as 
a full partner, if it really is committed to the principles of 
the peace process, it should persuade Israel of these 
principles. In practice it should find no difficulty in 
persuading Israel. Because by virtue of its relationship with 
Israel and by virtue of the nature of that relationship it is 
capable of making Israel's rulers respect international 
legitimacy and comply with the requirements of a just and 
comprehensive peace in the region. 
  A Syrian official said that the United States has precedents 
in this connection. After the tripartite aggression in 1956 it 
was able to force Israel to relinquish Sinai one week after the 
Knesset decision. Because then-U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower 
took an influential position that persuaded Israel. If U.S. 
President Bill Clinton were willing to do the same today with 
regard to the Golan, the peace process would move in the 
required direction. But Dennis Ross, U.S. coordinator for the 
peace process, has become a promoter of concessions to those 
violating international legitimacy -- which is not in line with 
the interests of peace or with the characteristics of the full 
partner that the United States claims to be. 
  The official said that Syria is still and will remain 
committed to the peace process and its foundations. All the 
evidence proves that it is seeking peace. This is a Syrian 
strategy, not a diplomatic game or a transient propaganda 
campaign. It will continue to cooperate with the United States 
as long as the United States continues to respect the basis of 
the peace process and the resolutions of international 
legitimacy. The problem is still not with Syria but with 
Israel, the U.S. position on Israel, and the lack of a serious, 
influential, fair, and responsible role. The official added 
that Israeli logic, which differs from any other logic, will 
push the Middle East region into a new whirlpool of escalation, 
tension, wars, and bloodshed. 
  On U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit to the 
region, the official said that the problem lies not in whether 
Christopher should come to the region or not, but rather in 
whether the United States demonstrates commitment to the full 
role it has chosen for itself. This role was not a Syrian 
invention or demand; it was a U.S. idea. 
  Asked whether Syria will agree to receive Christopher during 
the tour now in preparation, the official said: We are always 
willing to acquaint ourselves with whatever new baggage 
Christopher may be carrying, because we are seeking to achieve a 
real peace. If Christopher carries with him Israeli proposals 
that achieve the basic requirements of the peace process, there 
is no problem in joining the negotiations. However, we urge the 
United States to commit itself and adhere to the UN resolutions 
and the principles of international legitimacy. In this context 
we do not accept that there should be any room for any neutral 
approach or for acting merely as a mailman: Either Washington 
is with international legitimacy, or it is not. He added that 
the problem is not between Syria and the United States; the 
problem is with the Israeli position. And Syria is looking 
forward to hearing the Israeli proposals that Christopher might 
carry with him during his announced tour. These proposals 
should fall within a new framework so that the peace process can 
advance. He said that Syria has not yet been informed of the 
date of Christopher's arrival in the region. The official 
pointed to the existing full coordination between Syria and 
Lebanon, saying that the two tracks will not diverge, that the 
efforts being made to separate the two tracks from one another 
will fail; and that the Lebanese resistance will continue to 
fight until the land has been liberated.

  [Text] In the Kashmir Valley, militants fired a rocket and 
resorted to heavy firing last night on a building in Srinagar 
which houses the transmitter of the commercial service of Radio 
Kashmir. It however did not cause any damage to the transmitter. 
The militants fled when security fores returned the fire. 
Meanwhile, three militants and two jawans [soldiers] of 
paramilitary forces were killed and 11 others injured in 
separate incidents during the past 24 hours. The security 
forces have sealed off the Batamaloo area in central Srinagar to 
flush out militants. 
  Authorities in Srinagar are hopeful of securing an early 
release of the two British trekkers who were kidnapped by 
militants five days ago. An official spokesman said the safety 
of the kidnapped persons is the first priority of the 
authorities. The father of one of the kidnapped persons told 
AIR [All India Radio] Srinagar correspondent that efforts are 
under way for an early release of the hostages. He also 
appreciated the role of the authorities in this connection.

<F P=106> [Text of the 1994-95 budget speech by Makhdum Shahabuddin, </F>
minister of state for economic affairs and finance, at the 
National Assembly in Islamabad on 9 June] 
  [Text] Mr Speaker: 
  This day brings me great honours as I have the privilege of 
presenting the Annual Budget 1994-95 before the nation. The 
people of Pakistan blessed with this beloved motherland. 
  Sir: 
  The annual budget represents the aspirations of a nation and 
a society. It holds the key to the realisation of its dreams 
for a new future. Budget is like a prism, like a crystal ball 
which shows to a discerning eye the mystiques of the past and 
present. 
  Sir: 
  I can confidently say that his budget is truly reflective of 
realities, I can only pray for those who do not accept this 
truth. 
  This representatives House which has come into existence 
after a very transparent, just and fair election, has a special 
place in the history of democracy to forward and the democracy 
of the country since it enabled democracy to forward and the 
democratic process has gained greater credibility in the public. 
[sentence as published] The complete neutrality of the Armed 
Forces of Pakistan during the general elections have 
strengthened the public confidence in their non-political role 
and support for democracy in addition to their defence 
responsibilities. The nation by electing a Lady as Head of the 
government has also proved that we are also in the process of 
building a modern Islamic social system based on tolerance, 
justice, moderation, open mindedness and liberalism. 
  During the current year besides domestic factors our economy 
has been affected by external factors. Due to International 
recession, our exports have been somewhat lower. Besides this 
some lasting changes have taken place. A new International 
Trade Agency (WTO) [World Trade Organization] will make rules 
for world trade replacing the international trade order managed 
by GATT. This new world trade system will include additional 
components concerning the agricultural commodities, intellectual 
property rights, services and investments. There is talk of 
doing away with multifibre agreement. One the other hand new 
trade Blocks are developing. Amongst these, the latest in 
NAFTA. This will reduce the access of developing countries to 
the world Market. 
  During 1993 there have been extra-ordinary developments 
within the country which mainly relate to domestic politics. 
The government which had come into existence after a 
controversial elections was replaced by a Care Taker Government. 
This Care Taker Government undertook a number of important 
reforms for the recovery of deteriorating economy and held 
elections leading to the transfer of power to the present 
Government. Election of a Prime Minister nominated by the 
successful party and election of the President have brought 
about a new era of political stability which had made it 
possible for the Government to devote itself whole-heartedly to 
improve the economic situation. 
  Mr Speaker: 
  These political developments did not remain confined to 
politics but their pernicious influence also affected the 
economy. Economic indiscretion and irresponsibility of the 
previous Government was unparalleled. National resources were 
carelessly wasted and projects like yellow taxes and motor way 
were implemented which heavily damaged the economy and deeply 
affected the banking system. Consequently we inherited inflation 
and recession. 
  Mr Speaker: 
  GDP growth rate which during last 40 years maintained an 
average of 6 per cent had fallen to 2.28 per cent in 1992-93. 
In other words this was less than the population growth rate. 
Consequently in real terms the per capita income fell by 0.8 
per cent. Agriculture Sector which is the back bone of the 
national economy and provides direct or indirect employment to 
70 per cent of the rural population registered a fall of 5.3 per 
cent. Virus attack on cotton crop 1992-93 led to a record fall 
in cotton crop 1992-93 led to a record fall in cotton crop. 
[sentence as published] The then Government did not give it any 
attention. Cotton crop 1993-94 was again attacked by virus 
which caused tremendous loss to the farmers. This affected 
export and Textile industry faced a serious crisis. Stock 
market went into a recession. Foreign investment fell. 
Monetary and fiscal policies were being operated without any 
coordination. During 1990-93 rate of monetary expansion went 
beyond 20 per cent per annum, whereas GDP increased by 5.2 per 
cent per annum. Generation of resources was in serious 
difficulties while the taxation system was stagnant. Government 
Receipts as percentage of GDP were far less than the public 
expenditure. Overall fiscal deficit had risen to 7.9 per cent 
of GDP during 1992-93. To finance the budgetary deficit, Rs 
[rupees] 62.58 billion which was 4.7 billion had already been 
borrowed from the banks to finance the budget in the preceding 
year. [sentence as published] Foreign exchange reserves had 
fallen to an alarming level. On 20th October, 1993, they stood 
at dollars 326.3 million which were not enough for two weeks 
imports. Balance of payment deficits had increased to dollars 3 
billion. Economy had destabilised and major economic 
indicators, for instance Fiscal deficits, monetary expansion, 
trade deficit and inflation, were providing evidence of this 
instability. During 1990-93, inflation rate had gone beyond 10 
per cent which had badly affected the purchasing powers of the 
general public. In the Energy Sector the gap between demand and 
supply had increased. No meaningful plan was initiated to 
increase the availability of power and thus we inherited long 
duration load- shedding schedules. No meaningful progress was 
made in the Social Sector, literacy remained low and the rural 
population continued to be denied the basic amenities. 
  Mr Speaker: 
  Controlling the worsening economic situation and restoring 
the economy to growth path constituted a great challenge for us. 
Our manifesto contained a clear strategy to solve these 
problems. The corner stone of our manifesto is the well being 
of the people of Pakistan. We want to introduce a just social 
order in the country where by exploitation is replaced by a 
strong and stable system which is naturally beneficial for 
employee and employer and provides for increased productivity. 
We are taking steps to project the rights of farmers, women and 
minorities and by increasing the pace of industrial growth we 
want to make Pakistan a modern industrial centre of Asia so that 
poverty is eliminated from the country and every citizen is 
provides basic necessities of life. For this purpose we want to 
increase the pace of economic growth so that Pakistan can as 
quickly as possible enter an era of prosperity. We promise to 
eliminate economic disparities from the country by an equitable 
distribution of national income. A new tariff structure is 
being introduced which is based on justice and which will 
increase the government income and reduce the budget deficit. 
Increased allocations will be provided for the growth of social 
sectors. Further more, to encourage private investment 
unnecessary controls and regulations are being removed from the 
economy. 
  Immediately on assumption of power and seeking guidance 
from Peoples Party's manifesto, the present Government started 
implementation of a strategy for recovery of the country's 
economy which should help in solving all the problems. Instead 
to seeking cheap popularity, the Government wants the country to 
move into 21st century honourably through revolutionary, 
political social and economic reforms. Economic policy of the 
present Government is based on the following principles: 
  (a) Macro-economic stability and reduction in inflation. 
  (b) consistent increase in the GDP. 
  (c) Development of social sector, human resource 
development, increase in productivity, and elimination of 
un-employment. 
  (d) Growth of energy and physical sectors. 
  (e) Establishment of free and open economy and defining of 
a new public and private sector partnership. 
  (a) Economic Stability: For macro-economic stability, it is 
absolutely essential that budget deficit should be reduced to a 
level which should be consistent with the target of low 
inflation and ability to service debt. Consequently monetary 
expansion should be in line with the targets for growth rate of 
GDP and price stability. The third element which is no less in 
importance relates to international balance of payments. This 
should be kept at appropriate level which should not adversely 
affect the desirable level of foreign exchange reserves. In 
other words we want to establish such a balance for monetary 
fiscal and foreign trade politics which could help in the growth 
domestic production, control inflation and provide a balance 
between the two components of the economy viz. domestic and 
external. 
  (b) Increasing growth in GDP: An increase in the gross 
domestic product is un-avoidably for improving the standard of 
living. Fundamental objective of our policy is to ensure a 
minimum 7 per cent per annum growth of GDP in the future. It is 
possible only if both agriculture and industry grow adequately. 
Therefore, we are proposing a pricing policy along with 
monetary structure which should make it possible to improve 
performance of these sectors and provide for significant 
increase in productivity. 
  (c) Development of Social Sectors and Elimination of 
Unemployment: Compared to other developing countries, our 
literacy rate is very low. Due to in-adequate health facilities 
the average age longevity is also low. Pakistan has achieved 
significant GDP growth rates but in the human resource 
development indicators it stands at 120th position amongst the 
countries of world. Unless we make significant improvement in 
this, we cannot ensure continuous and durable progress for the 
people. Therefore, an important element of our strategy is to 
remove economic and social disparities as quickly as possible. 
Besides our Manifesto the history and character of the People's 
party demands this of us. 
  (d) development of Energy and Physical Infrastructure: 
  11. [number as published] In view of low priority given to 
these sectors in development plans their present growth rate is 
far less than the requirement. Growth of agriculture and 
industrial sectors is dependent on the provision of these basic 
facilities. A proper pricing policy and proper Fiscal and 
Monetary investments are necessary for the growth of these 
sectors. 
  (e) Establishment of open and free economy and defining of a 
new public and private partnership: 
  12. Our government believes in a free and open economy. We 
want to encourage free market policies. We are against control 
and regulations. We emphasise dis-investment and privatisation 
of public sectors since we originally introduced this policy. 
Corner stone of our policy is to encourage domestic and foreign 
investors. We have introduced a new concept of public and 
private partnership. Under this the private sector in 
partnership with the Government has to play a more effective 
role in social sector and establishing labour intensive small 
industries. It is also our policy that private sector has to 
devise such economic policies which should provide guidance and 
encouragement to the private sector. Basically public sector 
has to provide national defence and ensure law and order. 
  13. During eight months of the present government much has 
been achieved. 

  -  By 31st March, 1994 bank borrowing for budget deficit has 
been contained to only Rs 10.34 billion. During the same period 
last year the bank borrowing was Rs 61.87 billion. 
  -  Domestic credit expansion was kept at 5.3 per cent as against 
19.6 per cent during the previous year. 


    14. A new policy has been introduced for Agriculture Sector 
under which support prices for major crops have been adequately 
increased. Recent increase in the support price of wheat is a 
part of this policy. To increase the pace of foreign investment 
and industrial growth an Investment Board under the Prime 
Minister has been established. National Investment Council, 
Pakistan Investment Board and Investment Promotion Bureau have 
been merged into this new Board. A Data Bank will be 
established under this board which will Provide basic 
information for investment to the domestic and foreign 
investors. A new Privatisation Policy has been formulated and 
its process has been made more transparent and quicker. Thirty 
one industrial units have been identified for privatisation and 
some have already been sold. 
  15. Declining trend in production has been contained. There 
has been a record production of Rice and Sugarcane. Similarly 
Sugar and Nitrogenous Fertilizer Industries have achieved record 
production levels. However, with fall in Cotton production and 
its negative impact on Textile Industry, and the fall in Wheat 
production due to drought have affected the growth rate of GDP 
to some extent. During the current financial year considerable 
increase has been achieved in the production capacity of some 
important industries, like Textile, Chemical Fertilizer, cement 
and Sugar. Nevertheless GDP has grown by 4 per cent during the 
current year as against 2.3 per cent achieved during the 
preceding year. Increase in agriculture production in estimated 
at 2.6 per cent whereas it had recorded a fall of 5.3 per cent 
during the preceding year. Overall industrial growth has 
increased by 5.6 per cent which is higher than the preceding 
year. Trade Deficit in the balance of payments has been reduced 
by 35.3 per cent up to April, 1994. This was made possible by 
lower imports as compared to exports. 
  16. During the period July-December in the current financial 
year disbursement of industrial credit increased by 17 per cent. 
Foreign investment up to 30th March, 1994 stood at $417.2 
million which is 58.1 per cent higher than $263.9 million for 
the same period during the preceding year. 
  17. During the first four months there as tremendous 
pressure 
on consumer prices on account of expansionary monetary and 
fiscal policies of the past, increase in taxes in the Budget 
1993-94, increase in Petroleum and Cement and Gas prices and 
depreciation of the Rupee. Price Index for 20 consumer items 
increased by 5.5 per cent during July-October. The present 
Government introduced discipline in monetary and fiscal polices. 
Import duties were adjusted to keep the domestic supply of 
essential commodities at an appropriate level. Network of 
Utility Stores was made more effective and Utility During Stores 
were established. We expect the prices to stabilise as a result 
of Fiscal and Monetary stability. 
  18. Comparatively low growth in our social sectors has been 
caused by low literacy rate and falling educational standards. 
Our Government has decided to increase the allocation for 
education from 2.4 per cent of GDP to 3 per cent of GDP within 
the next ten years. In addition an Advisory Council has been 
established to introduce reforms in the Education Sector. Steps 
are in hand to provide incentives to the private sector in the 
Education Sector. A fifteen months' training programme for 
10,000 un-trained and un-employed female teachers has been 
started from February, 1994. This will cost Rs 25 million. 
  19. An integrated and large Social Action Programme [SAP] 
was 
implemented in 1992-93. We have expanded this programme. Under 
this, expansion will be undertaken of all facilities in the 
rural areas, for female education, primary education, basic 
health, nutrition levels, population welfare, clean drinking 
water supply and drainage. 
<H5>  Under The Social Action Programme </H5>

  -  Training of 10,000 Primary Teachers will be organised. 
  -  33000 Female Health workers will be trained to that birth and 
infant mortality rates can be reduced. 
  -  Facilities of technical training of 50,000 persons will be 
provided. 
  -  600,000 persons have been provided employment during 1993-94. 


    20. For the development of general health services 102 Basic 
Health Units [BHU's] and 21 Rural Health Centres [RHC's] were 
established during the current financial year while 2206 beds 
were added in the Hospitals. In the Health Sector, Additional 
3426 Doctors, beds were added in the Hospital. [sentence as 
published] In the Health Sector, additional 3426 Doctors, 250 
Dental Doctors, 1890 Nurses, 6800 TBAs [expansion unknown] and 
4900 Paramedics were trained. 
  21. We are giving special attention to the welfare of Women. 
Our last government established the First Women Bank. Now we 
have started a programme for separate police stations for Women. 
Women have been appointed judges during the current year. 
Ministry of Women Development have provided Rs 48 million to 
First Women Bank so that women can be provided loans for income 
generating projects at 10 per cent mark-up. 
  22. A new policy at a cost of Rs 700 billion has been 
announced for increased availability of energy. Besides the 
public sector, private sector particularly Overseas Pakistanis 
will be asked to assist in this effort. The present Government 
have started many major projects. Most important project 
amongst them is Ghazi Brotha Hydel Project. This project has a 
production capacity of 1425 MW [megawatts] and will be completed 
by the year 2000. This project has already been approved. The 
second major project is the Hub Power Project. This project is 
in the Thermal Power sector and the entire investment is being 
provided by the private sector. This project will be completed 
in 1996 at a cost of $1820 million. Its production capacity is 
1292 MW. Besides this a new policy package for the private 
sector participation in the Electric Power Sector was announced 
in March, 1994. Import elements of this policy package include 
product purchase price at internationally competitive rates, 
soft terms for credit in the local currency and simplification 
of procedures. It has also been decided that in future the 
Government will only invest in Hydel Power Sector and Thermal 
Power Sector will be fully reserved for private investment. In 
this connection domestic and foreign investors including 
Overseas Pakistanis investors will be provided same incentives. 
  23. We have provided full legal and operational autonomy to 
the State Bank of Pakistan. Credit system and mark up structure 
is being reformed to encourage savings. New financial 
institutions for special purpose like Kisan Banking Windows in 
public sector and Kisan Bank Scheme in private sector, are being 
established. I am happy to announce that Kisan Bank Scheme will 
be introduced from 1st July, 1994 and Kisan Banking Windows will 
be open for business in the entire country. Lending procedure 
will be appropriately devised to enable us to move forward to 
meet the requirements of small farmers. This will lead to 
growth in the agriculture sector. Separate allocation will be 
made for Kisan Banking Windows. 
  24. Reform of taxation system is absolutely essential. 
Without this objective of economic stability cannot be 
achieved. For this purpose measures will be taken which will 
bring about appropriate elasticity in the taxes. Taxes will be 
reduced on production and investment and transferred to 
consumption. I will be elaborating this later on. 
  25. Capital market has not fully developed in our country. 
We are intruding reforms to improve its performance. Foreign 
nationals and overseas Pakistanis have already been permitted to 
invest on a repatriable basis in corporate debt instruments. As 
a further step, trust money and employers provident funds are 
now being allowed to be invested in all listed securities as 
well as bonds, redeemable capital and instruments issued by the 
Water and Power Development Authority [WAPDA]. The Companies 
Ordinance and the Trust Act are being amended accordingly for 
this purpose through the Finance Bill. Moreover, Foreign 
Exchange Bonds will be floated in the International Market and 
our Stock Exchanges will be linked with major Stock Exchanges of 
the world. 
  26. We have devised an integrated and clear strategy to 
enable us to begin the new year with fresh determination and 
hopes. While increasing the pace of growth we will also rectify 
our weakness and mistakes which have destabilised our economy. 
Important requirements of our strategy are as follows: 
  (i) To re-invigorate the pace of economic growth and 
increase 
the rate of GDP growth from 4 per cent to 6.9 per cent. Major 
contribution for this growth will be provided by Agriculture and 
Industries Sector with a growth rates of 8 per cent and 7 per 
cent respectively for which necessary policies are being 
formulated. 
  (ii) The second element of our strategy is the establishment 
of Fiscal and Monetary stability. We are reducing overall 
fiscal deficit to less than 6 per cent in 1993-94 as compared to 
7.9 per cent in 1992-93. This will be further reduced during 
the next year. I will be giving the details later on. Monetary 
expansion which had reached 18 per cent in 1992-93 has been 
reduced to 14.1 per cent in 1993-94 and will be further reduced 
to 11.8 per cent next year. This will not only have a positive 
impact on inflation but also bring about fiscal stability. We 
will maintain the current year's rising trend in Foreign 
Exchange Reserves and further strengthen it by a 19 per cent 
increase in Exports. 
  (iii) Rate of growth of infrastructure has been less than 
increasing demand. Consequently we are facing loadshedding and 
other problems. A fast increase in energy, water, 
communications and other infrastructure is important component 
of our strategy. Higher allocations have been made for these 
sectors in the PSDP [Public Sector Development Program] for the 
next year. Private sector is also being provided incentives and 
facilities so that they can invest in these sectors. 
  (iv) Social Sectors have suffered from lack of attention and 
increase in population has made the matters worse. In this 
connection many actions have been taken which will be further 
strengthened during the next year. 
  27. In addition, on the direction of the Prime Minister, a 
programme to provide 33000 Village Health Workers has been 
started who will help in providing better health services to 
women and children in rural areas. These Female workers come 
from the areas where the Basic Health Units are located. 
  Mr Speaker: 
  28. The size of budgeted PSDP for the next financial year 
has been fixed at Rs 90 billion which is 20 per cent higher than 
last year. Our Government had wished to increase it further but 
due to resource constraints and requirement of fiscal discipline 
it was not possible. Our effort is that this development 
programme may be further strengthened for which public sector 
agencies like WAPDA, PAO [expansion unknown], PTC [Pakistan 
Television Corporation], and OGRC [expansion unknown] may 
further invest with their own resources to carry our development 
activities in their respective field. 
  Important feature of the PSDP are as follows: 
  (i) Allocations for educational training has been increased 
by 45.2 per cent. 
  (ii) Funds for health sector has been increased by 191.3 
per cent. 
  (iii) Rs 10 billion have been allocated to the Provinces 
for SAP which is an increase of Rs 1.2 billion over the last 
year. Besides this, Federal agencies are being provided Rs 2 
billion of this programme. 
  (iv) Development budget for science and technology has 
been increased by 97.9 per cent. 
  (v) 64.5 per cent increase has been provided to the 
allocations for Women's Development. 
  (vi) Adequate allocations have been made to different 
development schemes including Chashma Nuclear Project, Water 
Resource Projects, Anti-Waterlogging and Salinity Projects, 
Sainkdak Copper Project and Water Supply Schemes. 
  (vii) Rs 3 billion have been provided for Peoples 
Programme. 
  (viii) Allocation for Tameer-e-Sindh Programme have been 
raised from Rs 1.5 billion to Rs 2.5 billion. 
  (ix) Rs 3.6 billion have been provided for LBOD [expansion 
unknown] and Rs 0.5 billion for RBOD [expansion unknown]. 
  29. Irrigation water supply which was 127 MAF [expansion 
unknown] in 1993-94 will be increased to 130 MAF in 1994-95. 
Out of this 81 MAF in be provided from be On-going Irrigation 
Schemes including Canal Rehabilitation Scheme and the remaining 
49 MAF will be provided by new tube wells from the ground water 
resource by SCARP [Salinity Control and Reclamation Project] and 
private sector. 

  -  Approximately one hundred thousand hectare affected land 
will be saved from water logging and salinity by installing 804 
SCARP tube wells and more than 6000 private sector tube wells. 
Left and right bank outfall Drains, Punjnad, Abbasia, Ford Wah 
Sadiqua, Swabi SCARP and many other projects are included in 
this programme. 
  -  First two phases of Chashma Canal Bank Project have been 
completed and the third phase will be expedited. 
  -  Pat Feeder Canal Project which is under implementation 
satisfactorily has been provided large allocation. 
  -  A number of Irrigation System Rehabilitation Schemes will be 
completed in the next year. This includes renovation of 3435 
water channels, land levelling of 19486 hectare and 
establishment of Demonstration Centres. The expenditure on 
these schemes is estimated at Rs 1068.5 million. 


    30. In the Power Sector 6097 villages will be provided power 
during the next financial year. 570,000 new electric 
connections will be made available. Ghazi Brotha Project will 
also be started next year. It is expected the crude oil 
production will be 56000 barrel per day whereas natural gas 
production will rise to 1954 million cft [expansion unknown] per 
day. Forty five (45) new oil and gas wells will be dug in the 
public and private sectors and gas supply will be extended to 
additional 41 towns. 
  31. Work for modernization of Railways will be continued. 
Eighteen (18) new Engines will be purchased while 46 Diesel 
Electric Engines will be recommissioned. Better facilities will 
be provided for passengers. 
  32. In the Communications Sector, two hundred thousand 
telephone lines will be laid. The old Gateway Exchange at 
Karachi will be replaced with a new exchange and Islamabad will 
be provided with another Gateway Exchange. Eighty five 
thousands (85000) old EMS [expansion unknown] lines will be 
changed into digital exchanges. Stations will be established at 
85 different places for consumers and 36 new cities and towns 
will be linked with NWD [expansion unknown] facilities. 
  33. To overcome the water scarcity in Islamabad, it has been 
decided to increase to pace of work on Khanpur Dam to Islamabad 
Water Supply Pipelines by providing Government resources. Water 
supply to Islamabad from Simly Dam will also be continued. 
Moreover, a project for installing new tube wells has also been 
approved. 
  34. Provision of basic health services will be continued in 
the Health Sector particularly disease prevention and control 
measures and nutritional scheme will be continued in the rural 
areas. Twenty four (24) new Basic Health Units and 6 new Rural 
Health Centres will be established while 557 BHUs and 81 RHCs 
will be upgraded. Ninety one (91) new Urban Rural Centres will 
be established. In addition 3460 Doctors, 250 Dentists, 3600 
Nurses, 9700 paramedics, 33000 Village Health Workers, 3740 TBAs 
will be employed by the Health Department after completing 
training. 
  35. 3.92 million infant children cover will be provided 
under 
the EPI [expansion unknown] during the next financial year. The 
Prime Minister in this respect has inaugurated a new campaign on 
27th April, 94. 
  36. Special allocations have been made for population 
control 
measures. Besides this a Population Day will be organised on 
11th July, 1994 to highlight the different aspects of the 
problems and people may be encouraged for Population Welfare. 
<H5>  Socio-Economic Package for Karachi </H5>
  37. Karachi is the nerve centre of industrial and commercial 
activities in the country and it makes as sizeable contribution 
to the overall economic growth. The development of civic 
amenities has not received proper attention in the past. In 
order to improve the situation, the Government has announced a 
comprehensive package for the socio-economic improvement of the 
city. This package will cost Rupees 121 billion and it will 
primarily address problems on account of the shortage of 
electrical power, water and mass transit. In the energy sector, 
the power availability in Karahci would be enhanced from 1700 MW 
to 4000 MW at a total Cost of Rs 88 billion. In addition, the 
rehabilitation of KESC's [Karachi Electric Supply Corporation] 
transmission and distribution system will also be undertaken at 
a cost of Rs 6.2 billion. Further, a desalination plant will be 
set up which would provide an additional 10 million gallon of 
potable water per day at a projected cost of US $1.2 billion 
with foreign funding. For better transportation, the project 
for providing mass transit system for Karachi would be 
undertaken on priority basis. 
<H5>  Eighth Five Year Plan </H5>
  Mr Speaker: 
  38. From next year, macro-economic targets at the major 
elements of our integrated medium term plan. Our Government has 
recently approved the Eighth Five Year Plan in the light of our 
priorities and manifesto. Total outlay of this plan in 1992-93 
prices is Rs 1701 billion which is 48 per cent higher than 7th 
Five Year Plan. Rs 752 billion have been provided for the public 
sector and Rs 949 billion have been kept for private sector. 
Under the plan, target for GDP growth is 7 per cent consisting 
of 4.9 per cent for agriculture, 9.9 per cent industry and 6.7 
per cent for services. The Plan gives priority to social 
sectors, physical infrastructure and development of energy and 
water resources. Attainment of macro-economic stability has been 
emphasised. Accordingly, fiscal deficit will be reduced from 
7.9 per cent of GDP to 4 per cent of GDP. Current account 
deficit in the balance of payment will be reduced from 7 per 
cent of GDP to 2.4 per cent of GDP. Furthermore the Plan aims 
at limiting the long-term foreign debt to 36 per cent of the GDP 
and monetary expansion has been kept at below nominal growth 
rate in current prices of GDP so that inflation can be reduced 
from 10.6 per cent to 6 per cent. National savings will be 
increased from 15.8 per cent to 19.9 per cent of national 
income. Under the Plan 6.2 million new employment opportunities 
will be created besides that domestic debt will be reduced. As 
stated earlier legislation will be undertaken to limit the 
budgetary deficit. 
<H5>  Special programmes for Social Welfare </H5>
  39. Rs 50 million were provided for the welfare of 
minorities, reconstruction and development of their religious 
places and the needy under the Minorities Affairs Division. 
Another Rs 50 million are provided in the next year. Moreover, 
the Minority Members of the Assembly were provided Rs 5 million 
for educational scholarships for the students of minority 
community. Another Rs 5 million have been provided for this 
purpose during the next financial year. 4886 widows benefited 
from the loan remission policy for HBFC [House Building Finance 
Corporation] loans. In the new budget Rs 20 million under this 
policy have been kept for HBFC. 
<H5>  Zakat and Ushr </H5>
  40. The Government has taken many steps to improve the 
working of Zakat and Ushr [Islamic Tithe and Agricultural Tax 
System] system so that their operations are transparent and 
accountability of administration for indiscipline can be made 
certain. During the current financial year approximately 1.1 
million widows, orphans and handicapped persons were provided Rs 
1440 million. In addition Rs 960 million were provided for 
scholarships, medical treatment, technical and religious 
education through schools, hospitals, religious maddrassas 
[schools] and social welfare organisations. Mustehikeen [those 
eligible to receive Zakat and Ushr assistance] of Northern Areas 
are also being provided assistance. A target of Rs 2.5 billion 
has been kept for assistance from the Central Zakat Fund for the 
next financial year. Improved collection system under Ushr will 
provide additional resources. The Government has provided Rs 1 
billion during the next financial year for new agricultural 
loans and interest free agricultural loans for Haris of Kacha 
lands in Sindh. These loans will be provided through 
Agricultural Development Bank, Federal Bank for Cooperatives and 
Commercial Banks. 
  41. The former Government had kept no provision for Baitul 
Mal [public welfare fund] in the Budget. We have provided Rs 
1.02 billion in the next financial year for Baitul Mal Fund for 
assistance to the poor and needy. This is a reflection of the 
Prime Minister's deep concern for the welfare of the needy 
persons of the society. 
<H5>  Debt Burden </H5>
  42. The Peoples Government wishes to take the nation into 
confidence about our alarming debt burden. Past Government's 
particularly that of Nawaz League did not meet their expenditure 
by raising adequate revenues. They did not keep a balance 
between income and expenditure. 
  43. They borrowed more in three years that all governments 
from Quaid-e-Azam to the last Peoples Government. They chose to 
borrow, and borrow heavily, and borrow expensively. This 
unforgivable mismanagement sin increased our debt to such a high 
level that Government's expenditure on payment of interest on 
this debt is threatening the whole fiscal system. This problem 
can be better viewed in a historical perspective. 
  44. When the first PPP [Pakistan People's Party] Government 
of Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto took over debt servicing 
was 3 per cent of GDP. The PPP Government brought it down by 
1976-77 to 2.7 per cent of the GDP. Then came the Zia years. 
By the time the second PPP Government was sworn, in debt 
servicing had risen to 6 per cent of the GDP. Then came Nawaz 
League. By 1993-94 the estimate was 8.15 per cent GDP. This 
alarming growth of debt cannot continue. If it does, the 
government will have to tax people heavily every year only to 
meet its obligations towards debt servicing. The choice before 
us is either adhocism or long-term solution. We can borrow 
heavily to pay our debts and thus compound the problem for the 
future. Or we can raise enough revenues to meet expenditure. 
We are thinking of the future. The future of our children. Of 
our coming generations. Therefore, we have chosen the second 
course, because we do not believe in cheap popularity. We 
believe in lasting recognition and redemption in the eyes of 
those who voted us in -- the poor and oppressed, the middle 
classes and working classes whose standard of living has 
continued to deteriorate. Today, we adopt policies for 
long-term stability of the economy so that Pakistan grows strong. 
  Mr Speaker Sir: 
  45. I will now take up the Budget Estimates. Revenue 
receipts were initially estimated at Rs 217 billion in the 
Budget Estimates for the current financial year. The Revised 
Estimates stand at Rs 211 billion. This reduction is due to 12 
per cent fall in the imports. The initial estimates for current 
expenditure were Rs 258 billion. The Revised Estimates now 
stand at Rs 272 billion. The increase is due to ad-hoc Relief 
for Government servants and debt servicing. 
  46. Net capital receipts were estimated at Rs 40 billion. 
This estimate is being maintained. 
  47. Overall fiscal deficit was estimated at Rs 85 billion 
which was to be financed by Rs 23 billion from external 
resources, Rs 49 billion from non-bank borrowing and Rs 13 
billion from bank borrowing. According to revised estimates 
overall fiscal deficit will be Rs 91 billion while bank 
borrowing will be limited to Rs 20 billion. 
  48. National Economic Council has fixed 4 per cent as the 
target for overall fiscal deficit. The limit for bank borrowing 
for the budget had been fixed at Rs 15 billion. In view of 
these targets receipt and expenditure estimates for the next 
financial year are proposed as follows: 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|(i) Revenue Receipts                  |Rs 238 Billion                        |

  [Text] Irfan Ljubijankic, Minister of Foreign Affairs of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, arrived in Tehran this morning at the head 
of a delegation and was welcomed by Foreign Affairs Minister 
Velayati. 
  During the Bosnian-Herzegovinan foreign minister's visit to 
Tehran, apart from talks on bilateral relations and the latest 
developments in that country, the agreements reached between the 
two countries during the visit to Tehran by the prime minister 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina will also be discussed. 
  On arrival in Tehran, the Bosnian-Herzegovinan foreign 
minister said: We are seeking appropriate grounds to establish 
peace, but as the main causes of the war in Bosnia are still 
there, the achievement of peace seems difficult. 
  On the Bosnian Government's views on the UN Security 
Council's disagreement with the dispatch of peace-keeping forces 
from Islamic countries to Bosnia he said: The Government of 
Bosnia continues its efforts to win the agreement of that 
organization [UN] for the dispatch of forces from Islamic 
countries, particularly from the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  The Bosnian foreign minister said that among the reasons for 
the Western countries' contradictory handling of the Bosnian 
problem are their national interests and strategic 
considerations.

  [Text] Cairo, 12 Jun (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, minister of 
international cooperation in the Palestinian National Authority, 
arrived in Cairo from Paris today. 
  In an arrival statement, Sha'th said that during his visit 
to 
France he attended a conference of the donor countries. He 
reported that the financing of the Palestinian National 
Authority is facing a problem because the World Bank has stopped 
paying out the sums promised by the donor states. 
  He explained that the problem has two causes, the first 
being 
that the donor countries usually finance long-term projects but 
do not supply funds for the establishment of an authority or 
government. Sha'th affirmed that the very establishment of the 
National Authority in Gaza and Jericho requires money to finance 
the expenses of activities without which the Authority cannot 
function. 
  He said the second cause pertains to urgent problems 
resulting from the ugly Israeli occupation, including thousands 
of handicapped and injured people and widespread unemployment 
resulting from the ban on Palestinians working in Israel. 
  Dr. Sha'th, who is also Yasir 'Arafat's adviser, explained 
that one of the most important results of the Paris conference 
was a declaration by the World Bank and the donor countries that 
the Palestinian National Authority has met all its commitments 
and that the successes made by the Palestinian police and the 
maintenance of the citizens' liberties helped to rally 
international support for the Authority. Sha'th said this will 
pave the way for real progress. 
  Sha'th announced that he will return to Gaza on Tuesday [14 
June] to make the necessary arrangements for starting the 
National Authority's functions and to prepare for Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat's return to Gaza and Jericho as soon as 
possible.

  [Text] Abu Dhabi, 10 Jun (MENA)--'Abdallah al-Asnaj, deputy 
prime minister and foreign minister in the government which was 
recently declared in south Yemen, has said that President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih has not complied with the cease-fire decision 
which he conveyed to UN envoy Lakhdar Ibrahim. The cease-fire 
was scheduled to take effect at 1800 Yemen time. 
  Al-Asnaj, who is accompanying Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, 
envoy of 'Ali Salim al-Bid, on his visit to Abu Dhabi, told a 
MENA correspondent in the United Arab Emirates that the areas of 
Darb al- 'Amr, Khormaksar, (al-Mu'lla), al-Tawahi, al-Hiswah, 
al-Burayqah, and al-Waht are being subjected to missile attacks 
and heavy artillery bombardment at the rate of three missiles 
per minute. He said that the bombardment is still going on. 
  Al-Asnaj said that well over 700,000 citizens in Aden became 
homeless when the pumps for drinking water, power generators, 
ports, and residential areas came under bombardment. He said 
that the situation in Yemen is deteriorating due to the 
continuation of the war launched by the Sanaa regime. He 
pointed out the south is complying unconditionally with the 
cease-fire decision. 
  Al-Asnaj urged the international community to provide the 
citizens in Aden, Lahij, and Abyan with drinking water, 
medication, and food. 
  Al-Asnaj accused military experts from Iraq and Jordan of 
being involved in the Yemeni war, adding that the war machines 
of north Yemen are completely under the control of these 
experts. He said that seven Iraqi experts have been taken 
prisoner by the southern forces and that 20 Jordanian experts 
have been seen at the Sanaa Air Base. 
  Al-Asnaj urged the international and Islamic worlds to 
support the sons of Yemen in the south and to condemn the 
aggression against them. He said that Abu-Bakr al-'Attas and 
his delegation will later leave for Hadhramaut to meet with UN 
envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi. He added that he will return to Abu 
Dhabi on his way to the United Nations to follow up on the 
report that will be submitted by Ibrahimi to the UN secretary 
general.

  [Text] Cairo, 12 Jun (MENA)--The newspaper AL-AHRAM 
expresses the fear that the war in Yemen may drag on, as the 
language of artillery and rockets continues to prevail over that 
of dialogue and logic and amid signs that foreign parties are 
interfering in the conflict. In its Monday issue, the paper 
says that if a French magazine's report on the flow of Iranian 
military aid to northern Yemen is true, this would be an 
extremely serious development, boding ill to the Gulf area, the 
Arabian Peninsula, and perhaps to the entire Middle East. The 
paper points out that current signs give credence to the French 
magazine's report. These signs are apparent in the growing 
influence of the extremist groups in the ruling structure in 
Sanaa, as the Reform Grouping is the main partner in the ruling 
People's Congress. Other signs are manifest in the facilities 
given by the Yemeni extremists to their fellows from other 
countries. They give them, among other things, shelter and 
transit facilities. This cooperation brings together the 
extremist wings in Yemen and their counterparts in Iran on the 
other shore of the Gulf. 
  AL-AHRAM asserts that the covert sectarian substance of this 
war definitely indicates that Iran has a hand in the war, 
particularly in view of the existing evidence affirming that 
Iran supports the Shiite az-Zaidiya sect, which historically 
dominates Yemen. Concluding its editorial, AL-AHRAM voices hope 
that the two parties to the conflict in Yemen will be reasonable 
and spare their country and their Arab and Islamic nation from 
the evil looming on the horizon.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-'Azim Darwish] </F>
  [Text] As four political groupings are trying to establish 
themselves as legal political parties, some opposition figures, 
arguing that greater democracy is a powerful weapon in the 
battle against terrorism, are hoping the national dialogue will 
result in the removal of restrictions on the establishment of 
political parties. 
  Under Egyptian law, a semi-governmental body called the 
Political Parties Committee is empowered to examine and approve 
or reject all applications for the establishment of political 
parties. Those whose applications are rejected have the option 
of filing an appeal with a special tribunal. 
  Opposition leaders view the existence of this committee will 
disfavour, describing it as a sword hanging over political 
pluralism, and would like to see it disbanded. 
  At present, four political groups, embryonic parties, are 
vying for the blessings of this committee. They are: 
Al-Mustaqbal (The Future) Party, whose founder, secularist 
writer Faraj Fudah, was assassinated by Islamist militants two 
years ago, Al-Wifaq al-Watani (National Consensus), which is a 
Naserist faction led by Kamal Ahmad; the Egyptian Democratic 
People's Party, a breakaway group from the Islamist-oriented 
Labour Party, led by 'Adil Wali; and Nabil Fudah al-Nahdah 
(Renaissance) which is viewed by many as a front for the 
outlawed Muslim Brotherhood. 
  Ahmad Tal'at who, as Faraj Fudah successor, is fighting a 
legal battle to legalise al-Mustaqbal Party, believes that 
unrestricted freedom to establish political parties is a crucial 
weapon in the war against terrorism. "Just as there are those 
who raise the slogan that Islam is the solution, a counter-motto 
should be raised that democracy is the solution," Tal'at said. 
  With Fudah's assassination in the back of his mind, Tal'at 
believes that his party's principal battle will be waged against 
"those who politicise religion or vest politics with religious 
trappings." 
  Tal'at said, "There are those who argue that the principles 
of Islam provide solutions to various problems, but they should 
come forward with a specific programme outlining how those 
problems will be addressed. But to content themselves with 
merely raising this slogan is a form of intellectual 
intimidation... What is required is a well-defined programme 
that would be at the centre of extensive debate. No attempt to 
impose certain views, and no threats of punishment or reward, 
should be made." 
  Tal'at blamed the rise of terrorism on "the absence of 
democracy and pluralism, in the shadow of a single party and a 
single viewpoint. As a result, citizens despaired that changes 
could be made peacefully by means of the ballot box. They split 
into a passive majority and an extremist minority that believes 
that changes should be imposed by force. The way out of this 
dilemma is to broaden the exercise of democracy and remove all 
restrictions on the establishment of political parties." 
  Tal'at emphasized that legalised political parties alone can 
fill the political vacuum or else there will be attempts by 
minority groups to impose their views on society and undermine 
the very foundations of democracy. 
  Kamal Ahmad has been fighting legal battles for years to win 
recognition for his Nasserist Al-Wifaq Al-Watani party. Ahmad 
sought first to establish the party under the name of the 
Alliance of the People's Working Forces. But he was denied 
permission by the Political Parties Committee. He filed an 
appeal with the special parties tribunal but lost again after a 
seven-year fight. Now he has revised the party's platform and 
changed its name to Al-Wifaq Al-Watani and is keeping his 
fingers crossed. 
  Ahmad fought another related battle, contesting the 
political 
parties law before the Supreme Constitutional Court. He won a 
court ruling that a section of this law was unconstitutional. 
This is the section that makes support for the 1978 Camp David 
peace accords with Israel a precondition for legalising any 
political party. 
  'Adil Wali, a former MP and leading figure in Ibrahim 
Shukri's Labour Party, has also been fighting for years to gain 
a licence for his group, this time under the name of the 
Egyptian Democratic People's Party. Wali belonged to the 
"socialist" faction of Ahmad Mujahid that broke away from the 
Labour Party five years ago. But he turned against Mujahid 
afterwards and applied for the establishment of a Socialist 
Party. The application was rejected, however, by the Political 
Parties Committee as well as by an administrative court, with 
which Wali had filed an appeal. 
  Wali did not admit defeat, however. He rewrote the party's 
programme and filed another application, this time under the 
name of the Justice Party. He was turned down again by the 
Political Parties Committee and the Supreme Administrative 
Court. Now he is making a third attempt, by filing an 
application with the Committee for the establishment of the 
Egyptian Democratic People's Party. 
  Leaders of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood deny any 
connection with Nabil Fudah, who is working to establish 
Al-Nahdah Party. But many political observers believe 
Al-Nahdah, if it ever gains official recognition, will be 
nothing more than a front for the Brotherhood, its passport to 
legality.

  [Text] The Higher State Security prosecutor has decided to 
hold Ibrahim Sharaf, member of the Guidance Bureau of the Muslim 
Brotherhood, in custody for 15 days pending investigation. He 
also decided to hold in custody for 15 days the following Muslim 
Brotherhood members: Hajj As'ad Zahran from Damietta; Sayyid 
al-Naqqas from al-Gharbiyah; Muhammad 'Amarah from al-Minufiyah; 
Muhammad Suwaydan from Damanhur; Dr. Muhammad Sufani from 
al-Jizah, Ahmad 'Awad, assistant professor at Hulwan Engineering 
School; and Mustafa Isma'il, chairman of the Shari'ah Society in 
Bulaq. 
  The prosecutor also ordered the arrest of Dr. Hilmi 
al-Jazzar, a Muslim Brotherhood leader who has stayed in Saudi 
Arabia after performing the pilgrimage rites. 
  The State Security Intelligence Department arrested these 
Muslim Brotherhood leaders on the basis of reports that they 
have planned and financed terrorist operations. 
  Muslim Brotherhood sources said that the arrested leaders 
are 
innocent and added that this security move is meant to be an 
excuse to exclude the Muslim Brotherhood from the national 
dialogue.

  [Text] The Interior Ministry's security agencies have 
arrested 47 terrorists of a military wing linked with the 
deceased terrorist Tal'at Yasin Hammam. Thus, the number of 
suspects from the so- called al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah [the 
Islamic group] has risen to 145 terrorists, who represent the 
basic echelon from which terrorists are assigned tasks in 
assassinations and explosions in greater Cairo and the Upper 
Egypt governorates. 
  The State Security Detective Agency conducted a series of 
significant security operations, storming terrorist hideouts in 
the governorates over the past days. 
  This group, whose members had participated in numerous 
terrorist attacks, primarily the assassination of the secretary 
of the State Security Detective Agency, Major General Ra'uf 
Khayrat, was tracked down in complete secrecy. All the suspects 
were arrested alive and the security authorities obtained 
important confessions from them on the circumstances of the 
crime and the monitoring and financing operations for which 
terrorist Tal'at Hammam and many of his partners, both in and 
outside the country, were responsible. 
  At the hideouts they raided in the governorates, which 
number 
more than 20, the authorities found automatic rifles, pistols, 
explosive charges, and other equipment, plus many organizational 
documents indicating foreign funding sources and the 
organization's planned targets. About half a million pounds and 
$80,000 were seized in the operation.

  [Text] Cairo, 12 Jun (MENA)--The Higher Military Court this 
morning held a hearing on the case of the attempt to assassinate 
the interior minister. Seventeen defendants, including two 
still at large, face charges in the case. The presiding judge 
read out the list of charges in the case. All the defendants 
pleaded not guilty. 
  Muhammad Rashad 'Abd-al-Hamid Hijazi, the first defendant 
named, told the court that the confessions he made in connection 
with the case were extracted from him under torture. Hisham 
Na'im al-Husayni, the sixth defendant, admitted to the court 
that he possessed a pistol, as stated in the prosecution's 
indictment. His lawyer said that the pistol belongs to 
al-Husayni's cousin, who left it in the defendant's care when he 
went abroad. 
  The court examined 17 exhibits provided by the prosecution, 
including forged ID's and birth certificates, cassette tapes, 
and weapons. 
  Six of these exhibits presented to the court pertained to 
'Adil Siyam, a terrorist killed in a police ambush in al-Munib. 
These included personal and family ID's and passports, some of 
which are Yemeni; they carry Siyam's photo but are in a variety 
of names.

  [Text] Cairo, 3 Jun (MENA)--The newspaper AL-AKHBAR has 
expressed astonishment over Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin's abandonment of his previous approval of the issue of 
peace in the Middle East, especially with respect to 
negotiations with Syria. 
  In a comment published today, the newspaper noted that Rabin 
announced he had never said anything about Israel's readiness to 
withdraw from all the territories of the Syrian Golan Heights if 
Damascus agrees to reach a comprehensive peace with the Jewish 
state. During the negotiation rounds in Washington, Rabin 
repeated this promise over and over again. 
  The newspaper adds that on the Israeli-Palestinian track, 
Rabin has also issued threats and warnings, sometimes convincing 
and at other times flagrant, even after implementation of the 
first stage of the autonomy agreement between the PLO and Israel 
started. 
  The newspaper explained that as regards Lebanon, the 
Security 
Council issued Resolution 425, which stipulated the need for the 
Israeli forces to withdraw from southern Lebanon. In addition, 
despite the fact that negotiations between the two sides started 
in Washington and officially still exist, Israeli attacks on 
Lebanon continue. In fact, they have reached the stage where 
Israeli commandos kidnapped a southern Lebanese leader from his 
home publicly and with eyewitnesses to testify. 
  Concluding its comment, AL-AKHBAR stated that the Israeli 
practices confirm that all Israel's claims and promises 
regarding peace with the Arabs are nothing more than illusions 
and whims.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has confirmed that he 
has received three letters from Yasir 'Arafat over the last week 
regarding the autonomy agreements and the difficulties on the 
ground. Rabin said he answered the letters, but refused to 
divulge details. Prime Minister Rabin told our correspondent 
Shulamit Schmerling that Teddy Kollek presented him with the 
idea of inviting King Husayn for prayers in Jerusalem, adding 
that Rabin answered that if Kollek wanted to send the king a 
personal invitation that was okay with him, but that he does not 
know if the king would come. 
  Our correspondent adds Rabin confirmed that Jacques Neriya, 
his political adviser, has decided to accept Hayim Ramon's offer 
and take a post in the Histadrut labor federation. Rabin 
expressed regret, but added that Neriya's resignation will not 
have an adverse effect on the efficient operation of the prime 
minister's bureau, just as the resignation of other advisers has 
had no such effect. Yitzhaq Rabin admitted his working method is 
military in nature, with channels of command and analysis 
directing activities, and one adviser more or less makes no 
difference. 
  Regarding another issue the prime minister said that the 
government will no longer subsidize inefficient industries, and 
henceforth those elements that wish to stand on their own two 
feet -- whether a factory or a local authority -- will have to 
become more efficient and finance themselves. The government 
will not aid the local authorities any longer and they will have 
to bear full responsibility for their budgets, according to the 
prime minister. The prime minister made these remarks during a 
meeting with northern mayors.

<F P=106> [Report by Shim'on Schiffer] </F>
  [Excerpts] PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat has asked Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to grant financial aid to the Palestinian 
autonomy in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, which is in dire 
economic straits. 
  This request is included in one of 'Arafat's three letters 
to 
Rabin. 
  Officials in the prime minister's bureau have said that in 
consultations held on the formulation of a reply to 'Arafat's 
missives, Rabin ruled that Israel cannot help the PLO, either 
directly or indirectly. 
  A senior political source said yesterday that at a time when 
Israel lacks the necessary funds to help the Histadrut labor 
federation's sick fund, it cannot show generosity toward the 
PLO. At the same time, Rabin intends to formulate his reply in a 
positive spirit. [passage omitted] 
  In the letters 'Arafat sent to Rabin, the PLO chairman 
proposes, among other things, to begin discussions as soon as 
possible on the early empowerment of the autonomy institutions 
throughout the rest of the West Bank. Rabin intends to accede 
to this request, and contacts will soon be held between PLO 
officials and Israeli political figures in a bid to organize 
talks on this issue. 
  As reported yesterday in YEDI'OT AHARONOT, 'Arafat proposed 
that he and Rabin speak directly to one another and stressed the 
importance of establishing a "hot line" between them. 
  'Arafat also demanded that Rabin reaffirm Israel's 
commitment 
to preserve the status of Palestinian institutions in East 
Jerusalem. [passage omitted]

  [Text] [Announcer] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin promised 
Jordan's King Husayn that the Palestinians will not be given any 
authority in the holy sites in Jerusalem. Concerning the 
resumption of the bilateral negotiations next month, political 
sources here told our political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen 
today that Israel is willing to return a significant part of the 
territories in dispute along the joint border to Jordan. 
Following are the details: 
  [Begin recording] [Rosen] Today, again, the prime minister 
chose not to address himself to his meeting with King Husayn. 
  [Rabin, in English] I do not believe that it is advisable to 
say anything about it. 
  [Rosen] Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin settles for a 
general comment and several hints: 
  [Beilin] Clearly, the relations between Israel and Jordan 
are not those between sworn enemies. I believe that we share 
many interests, and meetings on various levels have taken place. 
  [Rosen] Is it true that the deputy foreign minister also met 
King Husayn in the past? 
  [Beilin] You read too many books. 
  [Rosen] The Rabin-Husayn meeting was held two weeks ago, 
after 'Arafat's jihad speech and Rabin's nonsense speech. The 
prime minister wished to calm the king and assured him that he 
will not give 'Arafat a religious or political foothold in 
Jerusalem. From there, they reached agreements in principle on 
issues under negotiation, which led to the agreements in 
Washington. On the issue of borders, for example, Israel is 
willing to begin marking the border in accordance with 
geographic surveys that will be conducted on site. The 
demarcation will begin in the area of al-'Aqabah and Elat, where 
a joint road is to be built. 
  On the issue of security, the parties discussed cooperation 
against terrorism. Thus far, this was informal; from now on, it 
is written down as an element of normalization before a peace 
accord. Other normalization elements are to be expressed through 
the joint projects: A Riviera stretching around Jordanian, 
Israeli, and Egyptian shores; a joint road to connect the three 
countries; and an Israeli-Jordanian park in the Dead Sea region. 
  [Beilin] Acting from a position of caution and not to be the 
first to do things, typical of King Husayn, and at the same time 
with his wish not to be the last, he made the correct decision 
to move forward while not committing himself to a separate peace 
agreement. 
  [Rosen] Sources in Jerusalem say that Major General Uri 
Sagi, head of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] Intelligence 
Branch, was a senior partner in the discussions with Jordan. 
According to some sources, he even attended the recent meeting 
with King Husayn. Shim'on Peres, formerly an enthusiastic 
supporter of the Jordanian track, is now out of the picture. 
Recently, he expressed disappointment with King Husayn and his 
willingness to make progress toward normalization with Israel.

<F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin with </F>
Israeli correspondents during a tour of the Jericho area on 14 
June -- live] 
  [Text] [Qol Yisra'el's Shlomo Raz] Mr. Prime Minister, in 
the course of your tour this morning, did you find that the 
military deployment in the region, in relation to the 
self-government, corresponds to the plans made before autonomy 
was introduced here? 
  [Rabin] Even before the visit, I knew that the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] deployment is designed to implement the 
commitments we made in the agreement and to create the tools for 
cooperation, to the extent possible, with the Palestinian 
elements in Jericho. My impression -- and this is an impression 
based on a visit of several hours -- is that the deployment and 
the tools for cooperation are working, but they are still in 
their very initial stages. Things become apparent as we go 
along. So far, the parties are showing goodwill in order to 
find solutions to some of the problems. Time will tell and will 
test the other side's ability to implement everything it 
undertook in the framework of the Gaza and Jericho First 
agreement. 
  [Raz] Are they keeping the agreement? 
  [Rabin] Yes, as far as joint patrols and coordination of 
activity is concerned. There are certainly things that still 
need improvement here and there, and I will not go into detail. 
  [IDF Radio's Golan Yokhpaz] Is it clear when PLO Chairman 
Yasir 'Arafat will arrive in the region? 
  [Rabin] I do not know. According to the Cairo agreement, he 
is entitled to come here. Here, in Jericho, is where the seat 
of the Palestinian Authority -- or part of it, with some other 
part in Gaza --, will be. Naturally, if he wishes to stay here, 
it is his prerogative. 
  [Israel Television New Channel 2's Rina Matzliah] Is an open 
and public meeting between yourself and Jordanian King Husayn to 
be expected any time soon? 
  [Rabin] I do not know of any such meeting in the future. 
  [Matzliah] Is there news regarding the contacts with Syria? 
  [Rabin] Currently, there are no contacts with Syria. 
Regrettably, the contacts with Syria -- past, present, and 
future -- are conducted only through the United States. I do 
not know for certain whether or when the U.S. secretary of state 
will arrive in Israel. 
  [Israel Television Channel 1's Alon Ben-David] Have you 
received any request from the PLO chairman for financial aid for 
the autonomy, and how will you respond to such a request? 
  [Rabin] Regarding financial aid to the Palestinian 
Authority, last week the donor countries met and decided to 
unfreeze over $40 million for the June-August period. This 
money was provided to allow the Authority to function in terms 
of paying salaries and the like. This comes in addition to the 
$5 million the United States gave them to pay the salaries of 
the Palestinians in uniform -- the police, with all its 
formations and uniforms -- for this month. 
  [YEDI'OT AHARONOT's Roni Shaqed] Mr. Prime Minister, the 
issue of the collaborators has not yet been settled. The 
Palestinians are still arresting collaborators and have 
announced that they will impose death sentences on those found 
guilty of murdering collaborators [as heard]. Is this not a 
violation of the agreement? 
  [Rabin] Regarding the second part of your question, it is 
their decision to make. Regarding the pursuit of collaborators, 
it does not correspond with the agreement. From this, we will 
draw conclusions pertaining to the issue of the Palestinian 
prisoners. 
  [Israel Television Channel 1 in Arabic's Yoni Ben-Menahem] 
Mr. Prime Minister, the Palestinians claim that you have not 
yet decided about the fate of the 200 prisoners who were 
released here last Friday. Will they be allowed to return to 
their homes in Judaea and Samaria? Have you made a decision on 
this? On the same note, how do you view the fact that many 
fugitives have found refuge in Jericho and are hiding in the 
autonomous district? 
  [Rabin] As for the first part, we agreed that some of the 
prisoners who have not yet completed serving their sentences 
will be moved here. It is their duty to make the effort to keep 
them here, in Jericho. We will do all we can, provided we have 
the necessary means, to prevent them from reaching their homes. 
  It is true that several fugitives from Judaea and Samaria 
have apparently arrived in Jericho. We will deal with this, and 
we will see what the results are. 
  [Ben-Menahem] Does the agreement commit them to turn the 
fugitives over to us? 
  [Rabin] I do not remember the exact details. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] If the PLO leader comes, will 
he be allowed to pray in Jerusalem? 
  [Rabin] At the moment, I do not know when his arrival in 
Jericho, which has been agreed on, will take place. I will 
answer hypothetical questions on what would happen should 
someone ask to do this, that, or the other when they are no 
longer hypothetical. 
  [Matzliah] Sir, you have just met with the residents of the 
settlement of Na'ama, who have been demonstrating since last 
night at the border fence. Did you promise them that you will 
deal with their economic distress? 
  [Rabin] I met with representatives of the settlers here. 
Several problems were raised, the main part of which involves 
agricultural issues. Last winter was warm. This had an impact 
on farming not only in the Jordan Rift Valley but also in many 
parts of the State of Israel, such as the northern apple and 
peach orchards. The Agriculture Ministry is dealing with this 
issue on a nationwide scope. A more acute problem arose here, 
compared with the economic distress of the other settlers in the 
valley. Na'ama representatives claim their situation is more 
serious. They raised several demands, and I promised them an 
answer within two days.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi </F>
Beilin by Yisra'el Segal and political correspondent Shlomo Raz; 
place not given -- live] 
  [Text] [Segal] Good day, Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi 
Beilin, or may I call you minister without portfolio? 
  [Beilin] Deputy foreign minister is accurate. 
  [Segal] Our correspondent Shlomo Raz has just reviewed the 
difficulties on the Syrian track, which seem to be the result of 
the blooming relations with Jordan. 
  [Beilin] Regrettably, this is not illogical. When we signed 
the Oslo agreement, the Syrians panicked a little and felt cast 
aside. As a result, they did not advance and even withdrew in 
the negotiations. I assume that the Jordanian affair does not 
please them very much. They would like to control the process 
and set the pace for the Palestinians and the Jordanians, just 
as they do in Lebanon. I am very glad that neither the 
Palestinians nor the Jordanians are willing to accept the Syrian 
pace, which naturally is much more cautious and rigid. I also 
hope this will not result in a real setback in the process with 
the Syrians, which is extremely important for us and, in fact, 
contains the makings of a comprehensive regional agreement. 
  [Raz] In view of this, was it not a mistake to progress on 
the secret tracks with Jordan because, as you said, Syria is the 
country that holds the key to a comprehensive agreement in the 
region? 
  [Beilin] Absolutely not. Our policy has always been to make 
progress with any neighbor we can: the Palestinians, the 
Jordanians, the Syrians, or the Lebanese. We seek to attain as 
much as possible with each of the parties -- all the way up to 
signing a permanent peace accord -- regardless of the others. 
We would be very glad if they all went along with us. We would 
be very glad if we could sign peace agreements with all the 
parties simultaneously. At the same time, we will allow no one 
-- not even the Syrians -- to have the right to veto moves by 
another party. As far as we are concerned, we will always take 
the risk of someone getting offended or staying behind if we 
face the opportunity of signing an agreement or making progress 
in that direction with some other party. This is why I am very 
happy about what happened with Jordan. I believe we made 
important progress. I hope the Syrians will also realize that 
comprehensive peace in the region is, first and foremost, to 
their advantage. 
  [Segal] We have just heard that Dennis Ross is now meeting 
with Itamar Rabinovich. Do you believe Warren Christopher will 
come to Israel? 
  [Beilin] I cannot tell; neither does my evaluation make much 
difference, when we will know the facts in a few hours. I can 
say one thing: Whether we like it or not -- and I, for one, am 
not happy about it -- there is no way to attain peace with Syria 
without the Americans. In order to make peace between us and 
the Syrians, they must come here and shuttle between Damascus 
and Jerusalem -- not just once, twice, or three times. If they 
think it is worth their while to come here only if it is clear 
in advance that progress will be made, there will be no 
progress. On the other hand, if they come here and work between 
the capitals, progress will be made. This is why I very much 
hope that they will not make a hasty decision not to come to the 
region and that, when they come, they will devote the necessary 
time to this issue, because the situation is ripe for making 
peace between us and Syria. The broad common denominator 
exists. There are gaps, but although they are very wide, the 
bridge between them is in sight.

  [Text] Since last night, Israelis have been banned from 
entering the Jericho autonomy region until a new announcement is 
issued. Our correspondent Ron Nesi'el reports that the reason is 
concern about attempts to attack Israelis after hundreds of 
Palestinian prisoners arrived in the town. Jericho itself is 
quiet. There is a large Palestinian police presence, especially 
in the area of the mosque, but there have been no reports of 
disturbances.

  [Text] Amman, 11 Jun (PETRA)--Yemeni Justice Minister 
'Abdallah Ghanim has hailed Jordan's honorable role, its 
principled support for its brothers in Yemen, and its continuous 
and serious efforts to realize accord between Yemenis. 
  In a news conference held at Jordan Hotel this morning, 
Ghanim said he will convey a message to His Majesty King Husayn 
from His Excellency 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, Presidential Council 
chairman in the Republic of Yemen. 
  He added that the message deals with the latest developments 
in Yemen and the full implementation of the Security Council 
resolution which preserves the territorial integrity of Yemen. 
The message also deals with Yemen's insistence on unity and 
democracy. 
  He said his short visit to Jordan is part of a tour of a 
number of Arab countries and is aimed to acquaint the Arab 
leaders with what is going on in Yemen. 
  Ghanim said a Yemeni delegation is currently visiting the 
Arab Maghreb states, and a Yemeni parliamentary delegation is 
visiting the U.S. Congress within the framework of political 
efforts by the Yemeni leadership to explain the facts to 
brothers and friends and refute the allegations that attempt to 
deceive Arab and international public opinions through 
portraying the conflict in Yemen as one between the north and 
the south, or as an attempt to impose unity by force, while the 
fact is that it is a conflict between the Yemeni people and the 
rebels and secessionists who carried weapons against the 
legitimate regime in order to secede. 
  Ghanim emphasized that unity was established four years ago 
and was not set up by force but through peaceful means. A 
referendum on the Constitution of the Republic of Yemen was 
conducted mid-1991 on the basis of which elections were held in 
1993, so how can it be said after all this that we are imposing 
unity by force? 
  Ghanim said the Yemeni Government unequivocally rejects the 
presence of foreign forces in Yemen, and considers the 
rebellious side's demand of entrenching secession through the 
presence of international forces a blatant aggression against 
the sovereignty and independence of unified Yemen. 
  Ghanim said: We will abort any secessionist effort, and will 
work for unity under legitimacy. Our duty is to confront 
secession and rebellion on the basis of our constitutional 
responsibilities. He emphasized that Yemen is committed to 
Security Council Resolution 924, which calls for an immediate 
cease-fire if the other party is committed to it. 
  The minister added: We know that certain parties are 
supporting the mutineers' position. We are surprised by this 
support, and we urge these parties to stop because it will lead 
to more bloodshed. He pointed out that while the legitimate 
government forces are demanding the right to affiliation, the 
other side is demanding mutiny and secession. 
  He stressed his categorical rejection of this interference 
in 
Yemen's domestic affairs, and said that Yemen would find itself 
compelled to reply in an appropriate way if that interference in 
its national sovereignty continued. 
  During his news conference, he touched on threats from 
certain sides, and said that they constitute plots against Yemen 
and its legitimacy. The Yemeni official appealed to the Arab 
League, the UN Security Council, and all the fraternal and 
friendly countries to confront those who wish to peddle these 
plots. 
  He said: We are against any measure or interference that 
would prolong the war and lead to secession, stressing that 
Yemen's legitimacy is seeking dialogue within the framework of 
Yemen's unity. No party alone, he said, has the right to 
represent that legitimacy and no one has the right to disrupt 
unity or even argue outside the framework of Yemeni legitimacy. 
  He added: We will reject the division or fragmentation of 
Yemen by any party, pointing out that international legitimacy 
has not so far dealt with us in accordance with the UN 
principles or Charter but in accordance with temporary and 
political interests. 
  He also said: I attended the deliberations the Security 
Council's members held before Resolution No. 924 was issued, and 
I sensed the extent of encroachment exercised against world 
nations in violation of the principles advocated by the United 
Nations. Resolutions, he said, are being taken in light of 
bargains and flattery and apart from peoples' rights and states' 
right to noninterference in their domestic affairs. The 
council, he added, also uses double standards. 
  Ghanim then praised the role of the Jordanian king, 
government, and people in maintaining Yemen's unity and 
territorial integrity. He also praised Jordan's media, which 
have stressed their objective support for right and media which 
the Yemeni citizen views as friendly.

general's envoy to Yemen, has arrived in Amman on his way to 
Jeddah. 
  He was received by Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state 
for foreign affairs; 'Ali Abu-Luhum, the Yemeni ambassador in 
Amman; the UN representative in Jordan; and the Saudi charge 
d'affaires in Amman. 
  Lakhdar Brahimi spoke to our political affairs 
correspondent: 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent] Are you carrying specific 
ideas from the UN secretary general to the officials of both 
sides [of Yemen]? 
  [Brahimi] The ideas are very simple. War and internecine 
fighting will not solve the problem, dialogue is the preferable 
means, and the international community is ready to help if 
possible. However, these brothers can solve their problem among 
themselves. 
  [Correspondent] What do you expect the alternatives will be? 
  [Brahimi] It is premature to discuss options. At present, 
the urgent objective is to have a serious cease-fire, to respect 
the cease-fire, and to resume the dialogue. The brothers in 
Sanaa say that they accept the principle of dialogue, even 
though they say that this dialogue should be based on 
principles. They have their own principles. We told them that 
is alright, and undoubtedly the brothers in the other party have 
their own ideas and principles. If the principles are accepted, 
then we will examine the bases, conditions, and circumstances 
under which this dialogue will take place. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Randah Habib in Amman] </F>
  [Text] Syria has decided to postpone indefinitely a visit 
Syrian Prime Minister al-Zu'bi was scheduled to make today to 
Amman as an expression of its dissatisfaction with some 
Jordanian press articles. 
  Informed sources in Amman have said that at 2000 yesterday, 
Syrian officials summoned the Jordanian ambassador in Damascus 
to inform him of the decision to postpone the visit, without 
setting a new date. 
  Damascus has expressed dissatisfaction with a report 
published by a London-based newspaper that said Jordanian Prime 
Minister 'Abd-al- Salam al-Majali had told the Jordanian House 
of Representatives that his country's reply to the Syrian 
request to set up economic integration is that Amman believes in 
coordination provided that the relationship is not based on 
slogans and emotions alone. 
  Al-Majali quickly denied this report, accusing the newspaper 
of publishing incorrect and distorted reports. He also stressed 
the strategic ties between Jordan and Syria. In addition, the 
Jordanian News Agency, PETRA, has asserted that King Husayn and 
President Hafiz al-Asad have decided to hold bilateral meetings 
in order to promote cooperation and integration and take 
advanced steps on the road to unity and comprehensive 
integration. While in Amman, Al- Zu'bi was scheduled to discuss 
prospects for setting up economic integration between the two 
countries. 
  Syria has also expressed displeasure over a Jordanian 
newspaper editorial urging Amman to go ahead in its negotiations 
with Israel without waiting for Damascus, which, according to 
the writer, has made progress on its track with the Jewish state 
without consulting Amman. 
  The Syrian newspaper TISHRIN replied to that editorial with 
a 
strongly worded article asserting the commitment of Amman and 
Damascus to joint coordination. 
  At any rate, political quarters here have not ruled out the 
possibility that Damascus also wants to express its dismay at 
the Jordanian-Israeli agreements signed in Washington on border 
demarcation, water, and security, especially transferring the 
negotiations to al-'Aqabah and Elat in July.

Kassab Samawi in Amman on 11 June -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Samawi] How will the progress made a few days ago 
on the Jordanian-Israeli track affect the upcoming meeting 
between his majesty the king and President Clinton? 
  [Al-'Anani] The climate now is far better that it was a year 
or two ago, especially compared with what it was like following 
the Gulf war. We think Jordanian-American relations will 
develop so as to clearly advance Jordanian interests. We would 
like the United States to become convinced that our political 
positions have sometimes been misrepresented and our demands 
distorted. We hope the Americans will also appreciate that 
Jordan -- which sets store by its independence, unity, national 
pride, people, and, above all, its leadership -- is qualified to 
engage such a great power as the United States in a dialogue 
that ensures the dignity of all sides. This is because we are 
aware that the United States is now the major player on the 
global scene and that it wields influence in many of the areas 
that also affect us. An improved political atmosphere between 
our two countries will impact Jordan positively.

<F P=106> [Report by Salamah Ni'mat: "Changing Negotiations Venue </F>
Reflects Their Seriousness"] 
  [Text] Amman -- An authoritative Jordanian source 
yesterday expected the Jordanian-Israeli negotiations, which 
will resume "in the region" next month, to witness "real and 
tangible progress with regard to a number of issues included on 
the negotiations agenda signed 14 September 1993. 
  The source told AL-HAYAH that the Israeli side "has 
expressed 
willingness to respond to Jordanian demands with regard to the 
occupied Jordanian territories, border demarcation, and water 
rights" -- which are among the Jordanian side's basic demands. 
  The source said that holding the negotiations in the region 
"means that they will be held on Jordanian territory and Israeli 
territory" for the first time since the peace process was 
launched in Madrid about three years ago. 
  The source pointed out that "holding the negotiations on 
Israeli territory and Jordanian territory -- and in the region 
in general -- will cause the peace process to move closer to the 
peoples concerned with it and will influence public opinion." 
  The Jordanian official said that the decision to move the 
negotiations to the states concerned "reflects the seriousness 
which will characterize these negotiations." He noted that the 
Jordanian-Israeli talks held in Washington 6-7 June were 
"practical and effective in reactivating the Jordanian-Israeli 
track." 
  On Syrian reservations about moving the negotiations to the 
region, the Jordanian official said: "I do not believe that the 
negotiations' venue is going to change their results or is going 
to change the negotiators' positions." 
  He added: "We agree with Syria that normalization should 
follow an agreement, not vice versa. However, we must agree 
first on what is meant by normalization."

  [Text] Amman, June 12 (AFP) -- Jordan's tourism association 
on Sunday denied an Israeli newspaper report that five 
Jordanians were to attend a conference in Tel Aviv. 
  "No member of the association, which represents the whole of 
the private sector, is going to take part" in the tourism 
conference opening on Monday, its director Yusuf Muwaswas told 
AFP. 
  Tourism Minister Muhammad 'Adwan also denied the report, 
saying his ministry had not been informed of any such 
participation. 
  The Israeli daily HA'ARETZ reported earlier that five 
Jordanians were to attend the conference for travel agents. 
  Israel and Jordan resumed peace negotiations last week and 
signed agendas for treaty talks covering water, energy, 
environment, security and territorial issues.

  [Text] Foreign news agencies and radios reported today that 
a Palestinian national, Yusuf Sha'ban, who belongs to 
Fatah-Revolution Command, stated before a Lebanese court that he 
carried out the bombing of Pam Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, 
Scotland, six years ago. 
  These media organs, including AP, CNN, and REUTER quoted the 
Palestinian national as saying: I brought down the airliner 
over Lockerbie. I have already told the investigators, but my 
confession was not recorded. I repeat here what I have already 
said. 
  The Palestinian national's statement is the latest 
development in the so-called Lockerbie case. It is an element 
which should acquit the two Libyan nationals who have been 
indicted by America and Britain. These two countries should, 
furthermore, refrain from levelling such a false accusation if 
they really want to discover the truth. 
  The state-controlled Voice of America has stated that Yusuf 
Sha'ban's confession will embarrass the Western powers, which 
have repeatedly accused the two Libyan nationals of 
masterminding the incident. 
  The attorney of the two Libyan nationals, Ibrahim 
al-Ghuwayl, 
states that such a confession affirms his belief that his two 
clients are not guilty. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] What will be 
the position of your clients following the latest development? 
  [Al-Ghuwayl] Actually, this is a very important development. 
Had matters been proceeding normally toward finding the truth 
this new development should have drawn people's attention to 
carry out a comprehensive investigation in the presence and 
under the supervision of neutral and decent foreign lawyers, 
judges, and human rights observers. 
  It was a coincidence that Mr. Mitchell, who is my first 
assistant in the defense team, was here to examine the defense 
of the civil case against our two clients. We have been 
following the news with great interest. And it is our intention 
to ask -- in our capacity as the defense team and in the name of 
the accused -- the director of the criminal chamber of the 
[Beirut] district which was conducting the case, counsel Philip 
Khyr Alla, to investigate the new development, in view of the 
fact that the news agencies have reported that there was no 
indication that the Lebanese state prosecutor, Mr. Sa'id Mirza, 
took seriously the confession of the Palestinian national. 
  Given the fact that such information is serious, and that we 
have a legitimate and serious interest in it, we will, thereby, 
be requesting an opportunity to continue our investigation in 
the presence of a number of honorable and decent Lebanese, Arab 
and foreign lawyers and human rights observers. We will be 
informing the president of the court of the name of our 
colleague who will be selected to represent us in Lebanon in 
order to take the necessary measures in conformity with the law 
in order to enable us, in our capacity as a party with a 
legitimate interest in the case, to follow such investigation 
seriously. 
  We believe that any serious and unbiased investigation into 
this confession will affirm our firm belief in the innocence of 
our clients and that the truth will surely come to light and 
will prevail. [end recording]

  [Text] Tripoli, 13 Jun (MENA)--Ibrahim al-Ghuwayl, the 
lawyer representing the two Libyans suspected of blowing up a 
Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, has stated that the confession 
made by the Palestinian Yusuf Sha'ban to Lebanese investigators 
today claiming that he blew up the plane, gives a new twist to 
his clients' case and confirms his conviction that they are 
innocent. 
  In a statement to MENA in Tripoli this evening, al-Ghuwayl 
said he was trying to contact other lawyers connected with the 
case to make the necessary arrangements to contact the Lebanese 
judiciary and obtain the details of Sha'ban's confession. He 
noted that he would then rearrange the documents of the two 
Libyan suspects' case. 
  Ibrahim al-Ghuwayl added that any negative reactions to the 
confessions made by Yusuf Sha'ban prove that there is a prior 
design against his clients. He said that in his capacity as 
coordinator of the defense team representing the Lockerbie 
suspects, he will contact Counselor Philip Khayrallah, director 
of the Lebanese Criminal Department. 
  Referring to news agency reports saying that in his 
confessions, Yusuf Sha'ban asserted that he possesses complete 
information, al-Ghuwayl said his two clients have a legitimate 
right to learn the contents of Sha'ban's confessions with the 
aim of revealing the truth. 
  Al-Ghuwayl added that he will ask the Lebanese judiciary to 
give him the opportunity to follow up Sha'ban's interrogation. 
He pointed out that this can be done with the help of Lebanese 
and Arab legal experts, representatives of the Arab Lawyers 
Association, and representatives of the UN Human Rights 
Commission. 
  He announced that he will inform the Lebanese Government of 
the name of the lawyer who will carry out the necessary legal 
measures on his behalf.

  [Excerpts] Tripoli, 10 Jun -- Brother 'Umar al-Muntasir, 
secretary of the General People's Committee for Foreign Liaison 
and International Cooperation, delivered a speech [words 
indistinct]. 
  He added [words indistinct] that what has become known as 
the 
"Lockerbie" crisis, which was made public in a sudden and 
planned manner on 1 November 1991, and despite the numerous 
efforts and initiatives...[agency ellipses] the three Western 
countries insisted on transforming a legal conflict into a 
political issue to achieve [word indistinct] against the Great 
Jamahiriyah, and resorted to the UN Security Council and issued 
three resolutions, 731/92, 748/92, and 883/93. Despite that, 
the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriyah agreed to deal 
with Resolution No. 731/92 and took practical measures to 
respond to [word indistinct] condemning terrorism in all its 
forms...[agency ellipses] complete readiness to cooperate with 
any quarter combating terrorism, affirmed that there were no 
camps for training terrorists, and repeated its call for the UN 
secretary general to send a fact-finding mission to investigate 
that. 
  He added: "The only remaining part to complete the 
implementation of UN Security Council Resolution No. 731 was 
that the two suspects appear before justice. As it is the case 
in all countries of the world, laws stipulated that the 
nationals of a given country should not be handed over for trial 
in other countries. Nevertheless, the Basic People's Congresses 
issued a decision stating that they did not object to the two 
suspects appearing before a fair and transparent court to be 
agreed upon." [passage omitted] 
  He stressed: "The Great Jamahiriyah insisted that the venue 
for the court must have all objective conditions required in any 
just court, because what was reported by Western media, what was 
written by a former CIA agent in his book, and what was 
announced by the director of the Swedish electronics firm that 
manufactured the timing devices refuted the main point in the 
charges against the two Libyan nationals, against whom the 
Western media had issued a verdict condemning them in advance. 
We would like to say here that this conference, in its 59th 
session, had called for a fair trial in a neutral venue. 
  He said for the sake of showing justice, the Socialist 
People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriyah did not object to the suspects 
appearing in front of a just and honest court that had all the 
psychological and legal requirements in order to achieve the 
truth, and to do the victims and their families justice. 
  He added: "You might agree with me that the style of the 
three countries [words indistinct] in tackling the case has 
caused us clear damage and injustice, and is not helping to 
solve the crisis in a satisfactory way." 
  He said: "In this context we would like to point out that 
international legal experts have studied the idea of trying the 
suspects at the headquarters of the International Court of 
Justice. [Word indistinct] and that the suspects' lawyer has 
agreed [word indistinct] to end the efforts to impose additional 
sanctions that will increase the suffering of the Libyan Arab 
people who have endured great losses as a result of the unjust 
sanctions of the UN Security Council Resolutions 748 and 883."

<F P=106> ["Text" of TIME magazine interview with leader of the </F>
revolution Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi by correspondent Margaret Sheno 
on 21 March; place not given -- first paragraph in introduction] 

    [Text] Tripoli, al Sayf [Jun] 10, JAMAHIRYAH NEWS AGENCY 
-- The American magazine TIME has conducted an interview with 
the leader of the revolution [Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi] on 
the 21st al Rabie (March) 1423. The interview was conducted by 
Margaret Sheno. Its text is as follows: 
  The Leader: Are you coming from America or from Egypt 
  Margaret: I was not able to come directly to Libya. I 
arrived in Cairo and hired a car with an Egyptian chauffeur. I 
traveled to Tubruq and Banghazi then to here. I crossed half of 
Libya to you. I crossed the world. 
  The Leader: We are sorry for the troubles caused by your 
government. 
  Margaret: Is this a fact? 
  The Leader: Certainly. 
  Margaret: Can you explain the style of this tent design? Are 
the colours of a special significance? 
  The Leader: That means the stars for the transparency of the 
sky and the sun. The yellow colour is for the desert. 
  Margaret: In a certain phase of this interview I will talk 
about politics but as we have met in the desert I want to thank 
you and I am sorry for not being able to speak your language. 
Can we start now by politics. What does this all mean? The 
desert we are close to your birth-place? Is it not so. The 
desert is one of my ways of understanding who you are when you 
tell me something I can understand it better [as received]. 
Don't you believe me? Tell me about your origins. You are a 
man of military training and you have written the Green Book so 
what does the desert mean to you? 
  The Leader: Firstly I am not a military man 
  Margaret: You are a military man. 
  The Leader: Since I was a student at the secondary school I 
started establishing the popular revolutionary movement and I 
created revolutionary cells. 
  Margaret: At the secondary school. Amongst the students? 
  The Leader: Yes, students and non-students. We joined the 
army in order that some of us pass through the army and use it 
for the revolution. I was not recruited as a professional 
soldier. I hate the military and I consider the military as a 
fascist organization. The military has destroyed the world it is 
the tool of invaders and tyrants which used it to cross the 
borders and injure the others and ruin the world. When I see 
the military badges I hate it because it reminds me of the 
badges of Mussolini and Hitler and then my theory calls for the 
abolition of armies as it calls also for the abolition of 
parties, parliaments, classes and governments. 
  Margaret: When did you start thinking about the revolution? 
  The Leader: Since I was 17 years old. Between [passage 
indistinct] the Libyans but in 1951 Libya was not like that. 
  The Leader: I started establishing the revolution since 1959 
  Margaret: Why 1959? 
  The Leader: That was the start of reason with me. It is then 
I knew that the third world was colonized and it is then I knew 
there was western colonization. 
  Margaret: Was that in 1959? 
  The Leader: Yes. At that time I was aware of it. 
  Margaret: What was the western power? Was there the king? 
  The Leader: In 1969 there were five American military bases 
in the Libyan territory. There were British bases, in fact 
armies, present here and there was the Italian settler 
colonization. 
  Margaret: An Italian settler presence in 1969? 
  The Leader: Yes. 
  Margaret: Then according to you in 1969 even with the 
presence of the king or others Libya did not belong to Libya. 
  The Leader: Certainly. 
  Margaret: What about 'Abd-al-Nasir? Does he mean something 
to 
you? 
  The Leader: He is one of the heroes of liberation in the 
world. 
  Margaret: In what way? 
  The Leader: Because he is a defender of freedom. The freedom 
of nations. It means that the nations lost an international 
defender. The cause of freedom lost by the death of 
'Abd-al-Nasir. 
  Margaret: The military has destroyed the world and created 
chaos as you said. But when you came to power for the first 
time you built the army with Soviet weapons, you went to the 
south to Chad. 
  The Leader: That was in the beginning, but now it is over. 
It change [as received]. The army is abolished now and it is 
replaced by the armed people. 
  Margaret: The armed people means the people with weapons. 
  The Leader: No, it is the armed [word indistinct] now 
onwards. 
  Margaret: You are saying that and you are smiling. 
  The Leader: There is no state in the world that I did not 
survive its presidents and kings with the exception of Morocco 
and Jordan. 
  Margaret: And Syria. 
  The Leader: In Syria I survived three presidents since 1969. 
  Margaret: Is that true but [Hafiz] al-Asad is a president 
for 
life as I know. What do you feel when you see the departure of 
these people? 
  The Leader: I feel the intensity of my international 
experience. 
  Margaret: Did you learn from these people? 
  The Leader: Certainly. 
  Margaret: What? Perhaps I am wrong but I mean the good 
things? 
  The Leader: I know that. We call it the good lessons. 
  Margaret: What did you learn from American presidents? 
  The Leader: I knew what is America. America is not a 
nationality like other nationalities. Not like India or China 
or [words indistinct]. America is all the nations. All of us. 
We have made America and we are still making it. Even my sons 
if they go to America and stay there for ten years they will 
[words indistinct]. 
  Margaret: Did your sons go to the United States? 
  The Leader: No. They have got the desire to go but if 
America allows them. 
  Margaret: Why do they have the desire to go? 
  The Leader: The elder son wishes to be the son in law of the 
American president. 
  Margaret: You are kidding. 
  The Leader: No. 
  Margaret: What daughter of the president, [words indistinct] 
Clinton I don't [words indistinct] don't like Arabs. 
  Margaret: I do not believe your son will marry the daughter 
of the American president. I do not believe it. Perhaps your 
son got [word indistinct] better expression. Do you speak 
seriously? 
  The Leader: Yes, I speak seriously. We have got a number of 
Libyan sons and they [word indistinct] Americans and offer 
sevices for the American people which they consider their people 
and they consider America as their second home. Some of them 
were educated there and remain there you have to thank us. We 
have highly prominent experts and scientists present with you. 
You have to thank the Libyan people . 
  Margaret: Thank you. 
  The Leader: Thank the Libyan people which is a small nation 
and even so they contributed to the making of America. 
  Margaret: You always have a feeling and the awareness 
regarding the size of your country and you always hold 
comparisions between countries as big and small. 
  The Leader: In respect of human beings we do not know of one 
big and one small. All the sons of Adam are equal -- it is you 
who know the big and small and the iron and wood. Iron and 
wood. With weapons. With wealth these are your scales for the 
big and small that is the American complex. You always [words 
indistinct] the people as big [word indistinct] 
  Margaret: Let us forget the question of your son and 
marriage. Do they have a different feeling towards America? 
  The Leader: We differentiate between America and the 
imperilaist policy. 
  Margaret: Can you describe that to me. This will help me in 
explaining this issue to American readers. What are the 
American policies that you see? 
  The Leader: The ruining of other nations' economies. 
  Margaret: What nations? 
  The Leader: All other nations especially the third world is 
still colonized and is not independent yet. 
  Margaret: Even Egypt? 
  The Leader: All of us. The third world will enter the phase 
of liberation. There will be no presence for the west in the 
third world, no tourist, no relation, no company, no investment 
and no trade. 
  Margaret: And you support that. I thought you were a friend 
of President Mubarak. Is he aware that he is colonized? 
  The Leader: Even Libya is not independent yet. The battle 
for independence did not begin yet. 
  Margaret: All these western countries pump your oil. Why are 
you not grateful for them? 
  The Leader: They need the oil and if we want to punish them 
we will stop the oil from them. 
  Margaret: No. 
  The Leader: We might do it. 
  Margaret: What will you do for cash and resources? 
  The Leader: We are not in need of cash. We need 
independence. 
  Margaret: Why - I don't think so, especially oil. I have 
seen scores of Mercedes outside. 
  The Leader: This is colonization. 
  Margaret: You brought it. 
  The Leader: We should have manufactured it here or else we 
drop it. This is the first step we have to take. We will not 
import goods from the west. And then [words indistinct] the 
force of the east will be sufficient rather than the west. 
  Margaret: What is this force? 
  The Leader: China, India, Malysia and Indonesia. 
  Margaret: Do you have any relationship with this issue. Is 
it friendship or treaties? 
  The Leader: We will shift to these countries so as to 
deprive 
the west from the billions they used to enjoy from our countries. 
  Margaret: Who do you mean? 
  The Translator: The west. 
  The Leader: We will buy the goods from the Asian countries 
we 
will open our markets for them. We will [passage indistinct]

<F P=106> [Article by Dr. Majdi Qarqar: The Attacks on the </F>
Brotherhood: The Salsabil Case and the Lack of Evidence"] 
  [Text] At dawn on the day when President Mubarak addressed 
the opening session of the national dialogue conference, the 
dawn visitors [secret service agents] arrested a number of 
Muslim Brotherhood [MB] leaders in the organization's Guidance 
Office and in various governorates. It appears that the cover 
of darkness was not enough for the dawn visitors, for they 
deepened the cover of darkness with the cover of national 
dialogue (one layer of darkness upon another). 
  The security confrontations with the MB in the past three 
years were characterized by partial and limited blows in various 
areas (the issues of the Dar al-Wafa' Publishing House in 
al-Mansurah, the Propagation Society in Bani Suwayf, the 
Salsabil case, the al-Sharqiyah case, and the case of the sports 
plot in Damietta to overthrow the regime by using a deflated 
soccer ball). But the recent confrontation marks a change in 
the security policy, because it was a comprehensive and 
widespread confrontation that included a number of governorates; 
it was a preparation for a bigger blow (as some are analyzing, 
calling for, and preparing for in government papers and 
magazines) similar to the blows of 1954 and 1965. We pray to 
God to spare the nation from the evils of this sedition. 
  The regrettable thing is that the magazine AL-MUSAWWAR 
prepared us for this recent blow several days ago in its issue 
of Friday, 27 May, which went on sale on Wednesday, 25 May. The 
magazine promised to publish the al-Salsabil case's documents in 
its next four issues (step by step with security). In the same 
issue, the magazine published what it said were documents 
pertaining to the issue of lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani, which 
it had obtained through its security or government contacts, 
though the magazine's documents are not worth the paper they are 
printed on. 
  The latest confrontation against the Islamic trend in 
general 
and the MB in particular began in the wake of the Lawyers 
Association's general elections at the end of 1992, in which the 
Islamic trend won a majority of seats. The progovernment 
writers' anger was aroused, and they appealed to what they 
called the "silent majority" to play a role in liberating the 
unions from the "Islamists." The result was the enacting of the 
"muddled" law of professional associations in February 1993. 
Union elections were held in accordance with this law, but the 
silent majority gave its vote to the Islamic trend and this in 
turn inflamed the pro-authority writers still further, resulting 
in the strikes by security forces. 
  Lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani's case set off the recent 
confrontation. The security organs used this as a pretext to 
deal a blow to the MB. But their attempt failed because the 
lawyers' recent action involved them all, regardless of their 
political affiliations. They did so to defend their association 
and the rights of its members in particular and Egyptian human 
rights in general. 
  Going back to the Salsabil case, which was the focus of 
AL-MUSAWWAR's documents and which it began to publish in its 
recent edition, we find that the magazine notes that it will 
publish in its next edition the MB's secret plans to establish a 
party, as if the establishment of a party is a crime punishable 
by law and the MB's reputation has to be blackened. The MB has 
been trying through the judiciary to ascertain its legality for 
more than 25 years. Obstacles are placed in its way even though 
it is trying to operate publicly through a legal party it is 
seeking to establish. What is the crime in that? The MB is a 
major political faction and has a right to express itself 
through a party. If you, the pro-authority writers, are saying 
that it is a secret organization, then why do you not ask the 
authorities to let it be a public organization through the 
establishment of a legal party as part of the state's public 
order system, especially since none of AL-MUSAWWAR's documents 
indicate that the MB has used or even condoned violence? 
  If we accept that the MB has a right to operate through a 
party that is being established, is it not also its right to 
organize its ranks? Was there a need, for example, to arrest 
the Nasirites before they declared that they wanted to form a 
party, on the pretext that they constituted a secret 
organization or a putative party? We in the Labor Party have 
always advocated the right of the MB and the Nasirites to 
establish their own parties. Now that the Nasirites have done 
so, there remains the right of the MB to operate through a legal 
party. 
  Since its establishment, the Labor Party has consistently 
sought to renew its blood by changing its officials from bottom 
to top every two years through elections. Will the National 
"very Democratic" Party follow the example of the Labor Party 
and MB or will it be content to use the name "democratic" 
without content? 
  AL-MUSAWWAR talks about a document that includes certain 
recommendations to the MB members should they be arrested. 
Assuming that these documents are true, we would like to ask if 
there is anything strange about this, particularly since the MB 
has been exposed to all this coercion since the late 1940s. 
What is strange about providing the MB members with certain 
legal information to confront the security agencies' 
fabrications and allegations? 
  The AL-MUSAWWAR editorial touches on the MB's plans to 
penetrate the professional associations, trade unions, and 
student federations. It said that the MB and the Muslim streams 
are seeking to marshal their supporters so that these 
associations play a correct role on the national and 
professional levels. What did the ruling party do in this 
respect? Definitely nothing, because the trade unions and 
student elections take place in a true democratic atmosphere, 
which does not suit the National "Democratic" Party. 
  We are writing this from the vantage point of the ranks of 
the Labor Party. What we are saying is right and must be said 
to back our brothers, who are working within the framework of 
legitimacy and the law despite the severe harassment and 
coercion facing them. Perhaps it is useful to recall what Labor 
Party leader Ibrahim Shukri said in his political statement 
before the Party's Sixth General Congress, and what 'Adil Husayn 
said in his latest article: That the MB is the closest political 
and Islamic group to us, and we have been in an alliance since 
1987 under the motto "the Islamic solution program." There are 
certain differences in details between us, and that is why each 
party maintains its independent organizational entity. 
  Confrontation with the Islamic reformation trends is 
erroneous and serves the schemes of the nation's enemies. The 
Labor Party has encountered severe coercion. After the Labor 
Party's political statement, which defined the party's Islamic 
identity, was issued at the Party's Fourth General Congress in 
January 1987, the security agencies began their war by trying to 
torpedo the party from within. The party's members, however, 
foiled the security agencies' plans and frustrated these 
subversive attempts at the party's congress in 1989. The 
Security agencies continued their subversive attempts, 
instigating divisions in the party's ranks. They then used 
certain security personnel as dupes every time the party adopted 
a correct national and Islamic stance on the regime's erroneous 
political positions. When the people got fed up with these 
dupes, the security agencies began to change their methods: In 
several governorates they began to summon the party's leaders 
and newspaper writers to the prosecution's office, arrest its 
members and incessantly coerce them. 
  This fierce onslaught and human rights are indivisible. 
Therefore, all sincere national groups must confront this 
onslaught. What the Labor Party and the MB are confronting today 
will confront the Nasirite Party, the National Progressive 
Unionist Party, and the Wafd party tomorrow, and the others 
later. There is no need to recall the wisdom of the black bull, 
who said he was eaten the day the white bull was eaten. 
  It is strange that the government is turning a blind eye to 
the external enemies and is daily creating new enemies out of 
the people's sons, as if all the people are its enemies or an 
enemy government is ruling the people. It is a short-sighted 
government that fights in all directions simultaneously: A war 
against the violent Muslim groups, against the depositors in the 
capital investment companies, against Egyptian workers abroad 
with the new tax law, against the trade unions with the unified 
trade unions law, against workers with the unified labor law, 
against our kinfolk in the countryside with the mayors law, 
against the university professors with the law on appointments 
of deans. O ruling Egyptian Government: Don't you have one 
wise man to make things right?

    [Editorial report] The 3 June edition of the weekly 
magazine AL-MUSAWWAR publishes on pages 20-23 and 70-73 an 
unattributed 8,000-words report described as "part one" in a 
series of reports titled "AL-MUSAWWAR Publishes the Secret 
Documents of the Muslim Brotherhood." Introducing its report, 
the magazine states that "the Muslim Brotherhood's conduct at 
the Lawyers Association the Tuesday before last, and their clash 
with the security forces was neither accidental nor a 
spontaneous reaction to the death of an anonymous lawyer 
involved in terrorist acts, as substantiated by evidence and 
documents. As documents prove, this conduct was a well-studied 
move that was prepared for 27 years. The time for it to bear 
first fruits was at the Lawyers Association." The report adds 
that the Muslim Brothers are trying to build a public existence 
on the dead body of the law and the Constitution. "Their goal 
from now on is to establish themselves on the political map as a 
fait acompli, although legally they are an outlawed and 
illegitimate group," AL-MUSAWWAR says. 
  The magazine says that it has obtained "14 documents" 
belonging to that secret group, all proving that "the Muslim 
Brotherhood could only exist as an initial and fundamental 
secret organization screened by a public facade, a facade that 
acts merely as an instrument for public relations or a curtain 
to mask the truth about the group and its objectives." 
  These documents were seized from members of the "Salsabil" 
computer firm in February 1992, following a tip that the company 
headquarters was being used for secret meetings to set up a 
Muslim Brotherhood organization to overthrow the regime. Signed 
by Muslim Brotherhood General Guide Hamid Abu-al-Nasr, the 
seized documents included a complete plan for overthrowing the 
regime. the seizure came at a time when the Brotherhood 
spokesman, Ma'mun al-Hudaybi, was trying in court to obtain 
Government recognition of the Brotherhood. 
  Opening with the statement "we are a jihad group," the first 
document stresses that the "Muslim Brothers must establish their 
presence in the political arena." For this purpose, the 
document puts forward a number of approaches: To inspire a 
feeling within every brother that he has a mission to carry out 
and that he should act in public without fear of the law or the 
security forces; to make brothers understand that, despite the 
ban, they are exercising a lawful and legitimate right and that 
they are not criminals; and, to substitute the policy of running 
away with "a confrontation spirit" so as to emerge from the 
narrow circle of the brotherhood family into the larger society 
through involvement in public activity, because a decision had 
already been made to get recognition for the organization. 
  The document emphasizes the need to take practical action to 
set up "branches" in governorates through which the brothers can 
exercise their activities. It also stresses that popular Muslim 
Brother key figures must act in the governorates as "active 
cells" to whom public opinion can refer concerning the 
Brotherhood. It warns, however, against going too far both in 
publicizing the names of these figures and in keeping them 
secret. In other words, the document adds, "a balance should be 
maintained between secrecy and publicity and between the size of 
the Brotherhood and the degree of popularization. Everybody 
should seek to limit the amount of information that reaches the 
security apparatuses; this can be done through several methods, 
primarily through a constant change of faces and by giving an 
opportunity to youth to take the responsibility." According to 
the document, "this security policy must balance our needs until 
we can impose a kind of public existence, provided that we take 
care to avoid provoking the security apparatuses without strong 
reasons." 
  The "second document" explains that the aforementioned goal 
requires a general, understandable, and well-calculated security 
policy vis-a-vis the existing policy of the security agencies. 
This policy must take into consideration the unique 
circumstances of every area. Hence, the document stresses "the 
need to maintain pressure groups at all times to curb security 
pressure on the Brotherhood locally and abroad." 
  At the local level, the report adds, the document stresses 
the need for the Muslim Brothers to be active in trade and 
professional associations, student unions, and accredited 
charity organizations, leaving sectors like students to evolve 
naturally without restriction or planning. It also stresses 
that Brotherhood figures must be known to everyone in the 
various positions of responsibility and must appear at all 
occasions. 
  At world level, the document emphasizes the need for the 
Muslim Brotherhood to be represented in worldwide organizations 
that foster the cause of freedom, such as Amnesty International, 
and to have its own organizations--like the World Islamic 
Organization, the Islamic Human Rights Organization, and the 
Islamic Lawyers Organization--to put pressure on the Egyptian 
regime through all available means, like cables and contacts 
with embassies. 
  According to the report, the most serious point in this 
document is a question it poses about "the possibility of 
establishing channels of communication with the security 
apparatus through some known figures in the movement and by 
studying how much this contact can be used to achieve the 
Brotherhood's objectives and activities." 
  The document suggests that a security committee called "the 
liaison committee" be established to "promote a high security 
awareness among Brothers, monitor and analyze the security 
apparatus' activities, and work out ways to handle it." This 
committee, the document adds, must have links with the persons 
responsible for the different security sections to find out the 
impact of the security policy on them. 
  The AL-MUSSAWAR report cites "another document" on the 
Brotherhood's policy during the "preparatory stage." It says 
that the most important proposal in that document is "to 
guarantee the security apparatus' neutrality in the battle to 
overthrow the regime." Stating that the Egyptian public is made 
up of a silent majority and that a number of politicians aspire 
to control them one way or another, the document asks why the 
Muslim Brothers do not utilize this factor in working with the 
Egyptian public. 
  As for how to achieve this, the document contends that all 
leftist and rightist currents have opted to take the 
Government's side and this allows it to concentrate all its time 
and resources to resisting religious and other currents. To 
explain this conduct, the document says that none of these 
currents have any grassroots popularity, and hence, they were 
careful to seek the state's protection. The second reason is 
that these political currents thought that the Islamic current 
was determined to monopolize authority, and to them this is 
worse than the existing situation. That is why the confrontation 
heated up between the Islamic current and the state. 
  Moving on to the state's approach to fighting the Islamic 
current, which the document believes is more favorable to the 
Brotherhood than ever, the document contends that "the state 
lacks an organized and scientific approach to confronting 
political Islam, since policymakers are not qualified for this 
role" and adds that the public have no respect for the police, 
particularly after repeated attacks against police officers by 
the Islamic Group. 
  Elaborating further on this point, the document says that 
the 
state resorts to legislation and laws to curb the Muslim 
Brotherhood. However, Muslim Brothers should not fear such 
legislation since no measures have been taken so far in cases 
involving Muslim Brothers. The document explains that the state 
does not pursue these cases to trials, preferring to keep the 
persons involved under custody for several months until the 
court releases them and dismisses the case. 
  The document then shows the pros and cons of making 
confessions to the National Security Authority, the prosecution, 
and the court should a Brother get caught and be forced to 
confess. It then talks about the problems facing the 
Brotherhood internally; they involve cultural, educational, 
social, and economic problems. 
  The "fourth document" talks about the Brotherhoods' 
"organizational structure," and states that "the organization is 
ready indeed, its program and internal structure accurately 
determined, and it is waiting for the starting signal." 
  This document is a draft chart, showing the organization is 
headed by General Guide Hamid Abu-al-Nasr, who also chairs "the 
General Shura Council." He is assisted by his two deputies, 
Ahmad al-Malat and Mustafa Mashhur, and the "Permanent Bureau 
Panel," which is made up of an unspecified number of members. 
  The document then lists the members of the permanent bureau, 
specialized committees, and other affiliated bodies and outlines 
the organization's statute. 
  The last part of the magazine report cites a document on the 
results of recent elections for the "Guidance Bureau," listing 
the bureau's members.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a comprehensive review 
of all items in the 3 June issue of the Arabic-language 
newspaper Cairo AL-SHA'B that pertain to political Islamic 
issues. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Detained Lawyers Still in Custody 
  2. Brotherhood Leader, Party Members To Be Questioned 
  3. Journalists Committee To Discuss Detention of Colleagues 
  4. Scholar Refutes Writer's Claims on Fatwa 
  5. Party Leader Supports Muslim Brotherhood 
  6. TV Children's Programs Criticized 
<H5>  DETAINED LAWYERS STILL IN CUSTODY </H5>
  Mu'tazz al-Hadidi, in an approximately 700-word report on 
pages 1 and 7, notes that the Central Cairo Public Attorney will 
decide on 5 June whether or not to continue to hold in custody 
lawyers detained following a demonstration outside the Lawyers's 
Association building in Cairo on 17 May. The lawyers, including 
some members of the Association's Council, were protesting the 
death of lawyer 'Abd-al- Harith Madani while in police custody 
on 26 April. The report notes that outside the Public 
Attorney's office hundreds of lawyers and relatives of the 
detainees gathered in solidarity with the detained lawyers. The 
report adds that at a meeting of the Lawyers Association's 
Council on 31 May, the conferees decided to form a delegation 
led by Association head Ahmad al-Khawajah to meet with President 
Mubarak to hand him a petition requesting the release of all the 
detained lawyers and a "serious investigation" into the causes 
of the death of lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani. Speaking at the 
meeting, al-Khawajah noted that the arrest of three Council 
members is a "serious precedent." Noting that his statements 
published in AKHBAR AL-YAWM and AKHIR SA'AH have been partly 
distorted, he denied having said that he found it difficult to 
deal with the current council, which is controlled by the Muslim 
Brotherhood. For his part, the Association's Secretary General 
Ahmad Sayf-al-Islam al-Banna, who is a Muslim Brotherhood 
figure, complained that some officials are giving the president 
a "bad image" of the Association, adding that the Interior 
Ministry officials failed to calm down the angry lawyers who 
were demanding to see an autopsy report on Madani's death. In 
an attempt to distance the Council from any connection with the 
Muslim Brotherhood, al-Banna concluded that "the Association 
cannot accept leadership by any external group," adding that the 
lawyers are free. 
<H5>  BROTHERHOOD LEADER, PARTY MEMBERS TO BE QUESTIONED </H5>
  An unattributed 70-word report on page 1 notes that the 
Northern al-Jizah Prosecutor has summoned Hamid Abu-al-Nasr, 
Muslim Brotherhood General Guide, to appear before him on 5 June 
to be questioned about a statement bearing his signature that 
was distributed during 'Id al-Adha. The report adds that four 
unnamed "youngsters" have been questioned and remanded in 
custody for 15 days by the Imbabah prosecutor in connection with 
the same statement, which includes a congratulatory message from 
the Brotherhood guide to Muslims on the occasion of 'Id al-Adha. 
  On the same page, another 100-word unattributed report says 
that "members of the Labor Party detained following the 'Id 
al-Adha prayers at the Mustafa Mahmud Mosque will appear before 
the al-Duqqi prosecutor tomorrow following the expiration of the 
term of remand set by the prosecutor to complete the 
investigations." The report names the detainees as Muhsin 
Hashim, member of the Labor Party's Executive Committee; Mahmud 
'Abd-al-Rahman, party secretary in al- Marj area; his secondary 
school student son 'Atif 'Abd-al-Rahman; Tariq Faruq, and Rashad 
Ahmad 'Ali. The report does not specify the charges against the 
members. 
<H5>  JOURNALISTS COMMITTEE TO DISCUSS DETENTION OF COLLEAGUES </H5>
  An unattributed 100-word report on page 1 notes that the 
Freedoms Committee of the Journalists Association will meet at 
the association's headquarters on June 6 to discuss the "latest 
developments" of AL-SHA'B military correspondent 'Abd-al-Sattar 
Abu- Husayn, who is serving a one-year prison term, passed by 
the Higher Military Court for publishing a report without 
obtaining permission from the competent authorities. The 
committee will also discuss the arrest of Ibrahim al-Sayyid 
Muhammad Sa'd, a MENA journalist arrested at his home in 
al-Munib on 1 June. 
<H5>  SCHOLAR REFUTES WRITER'S CLAIMS ON FATWA </H5>
  An approximately 700-word article on page 2 by Mahmud Fayid, 
identified as general secretary of the al-jam'iyat al-shar'iyah 
religious societies, comments on a column by writer Anis Mansur 
published by AL-AHRAM on 4 March 1994. In his column, Mansur 
claimed that in 1928 al-Azhar scholar Shaykh Muhammad 'Abduh was 
asked if checkbook savings are halal, meaning religiously 
permitted, and 'Abduh's answer was yes. Mansur then praised 
'Abduh for being an "enlightened" scholar and lauded Mufti 
Shaykh Sayyid Tantawi, a disciple of Shaykh 'Abduh, for his 
courage, dedication, and sincerity. The writer notes that out 
of his belief that Mansur's words deserved some comments, he 
sent two messages to AL-AHRAM's chief editor about the matter, 
but the paper never published them. Refuting Mansur's claims, 
the writer points out that Shaykh 'Abduh died in 1905, so he 
could not have possibly arisen from the dead 23 years later to 
answer the above question. He further adds that he examined the 
subject matter and found the fatwa to be false. 
<H5>  PARTY LEADER SUPPORTS MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD </H5>
  Commenting on the Government's clampdown on the Muslim 
Brotherhood, Labor Party Secretary General 'Adil Husayn writes 
the following in a boxed commentary below his weekly article on 
page 5: "We hope that the campaign against the Brotherhood will 
not go beyond the current limits. We hope that the arrests will 
not be broadened and that there will be no clampdown on the 
[professional] associations. If it is proved that the current 
campaign is part of a general campaign of onslaughts against 
Islam and the Muslims, it will be a major disaster for the 
Government and will finish off any hope for stability. The 
Labor Party supports the ongoing efforts to contain armed 
political violence, but extending the campaign of repression and 
persecution to include the Brotherhood cannot be within this 
framework. Nobody will believe you if you say that the 
Brotherhood supports or finances the terrorist organizations. 
For our part, we do not distance ourselves from our principled 
stand of cooperating with the Brotherhood and defending their 
right to operate legally. True we are two independent 
organizations and true we have some differences in concepts and 
methods of action, but the points of agreement between us exceed 
the points of disagreement, and both of us have the general goal 
of applying the shari'ah. If striking at the Brotherhood means 
that the moderate and reform-oriented Islamic movements will 
meet the same fate as the revolutionary extremist movements, 
this will not frighten us. Do what you like with us, and our 
party will, God willing, persevere. God is our sole and true 
supporter." 
  Commenting on the lawyers' protests at the death of their 
colleague Madani while in police custody, Husayn, in his 
approximately 4,000-word article on the same page, asks how can 
the lawyers be blamed for being angry in the right cause and in 
the face of the government's reluctance to punish the murderers? 
He adds: "What is so strange about lawyers demanding their 
right to protest to the authorities in an organized march?" He 
notes that the events at the Lawyers Association did not require 
a conspiracy by the "Brotherhood," adding that what happened was 
a natural and spontaneous reaction by lawyers representing 
various political trends, including leftists, Wafdists, and 
Labor Party members. 
<H5>  CHILDREN'S TV PROGRAMS CRITICIZED </H5>
  Writer Nur-al-Huda Sa'd, in an approximately 600-word 
article 
published in the "Women's Voice" feature on page 6, criticizes 
an unnamed television program in which the broadcasters 
reproached some young girls for not having friends of the 
opposite sex. Another child spoke of his dream of becoming a 
police officer to "rid the country of extremism, terrorism, and 
the bad guys who wish to destroy Egypt." The writer adds: 
"Thus, the children''s programs have turned into a way to 
brainwash children with a view to shaping their views in a 
certain way satisfactory to the Government, blessed by the 
United States, and in line with the requirements of the new 
world order. The programs incite girls to befriend boys and to 
write to them and treat those who do not do so as cowardly and 
hesitant. They lead boys to believe that our real enemy is 
terrorism and extremism, not Israel, the Serbs, or the Hindus, 
and that the main job of a police officer is to fight terrorism, 
not track down criminals or protect citizens." The writer adds 
that "youngsters' songs" encourage flirtation between boys and 
girls and brand "decently dressed" women as "reactionary." She 
adds: "A disciplined girl is always blamed and accused of 
suffering from complexes. She is said to wear the veil to 
escape her economic difficulties and resort to religion to 
offset her inability to cope with the developments of this 
dynamic age." 
  On the same page, an unattributed report criticizes the 
television for broadcasting a party marking the fourth birthday 
of the women's magazine HURRIYATI, in which singers danced with 
"short dresses" and belly dangers competed. The report notes 
that sitting among the audience was Samir Rajab, chairman of the 
board and columnist of the religious newspaper 'AQIDATI. The 
report concludes by asking: "Is dancing or pleasure the only 
alternative to extremism and terrorism on the television screen, 
which belongs to the people and must respect their religion and 
feelings?"

    [Editorial Report] The following is a comprehensive review

newspaper AL-SHA'B that pertain to political Islamic issues.

<H5>  AUTHORITIES CONTINUE DETENTION OF 33 LAWYERS </H5>
  An approximately 450-word report on pages 1 and 7 by Mu'tazz 
al- Hadidi indicates that the Central Cairo Prosecution Office 
has extended for 15 days the detention of 33 lawyers who were 
arrested in connection with the Lawyers Association incidents. 
It adds that the Prosecution Office released 15 others, 
including 6 citizens who were arrested randomly off the streets 
during a clash between police and lawyers, and it names the 
freed lawyers. Al-Hadidi says the freed lawyers assembled at 
the court and protested the continued detention of their 
colleagues; meanwhile the security forces surrounded the court. 
A number of lawyers who attended the court session held a 
meeting at which they called for a expanded conference of 
lawyers on Thursday and formed a committee, made up of 24 
lawyers, to act as a link between the Bar Association Council 
and the lawyers. 
  The report says that over 250 lawyers who attended the 
meeting decided to keep the offices of the detained lawyers 
operating. It adds that the lawyers issued a statement after 
the conference saying that "we lawyers will not retreat, despite 
the bombs and arrests, but will continue the escalation in 
continuation of the Egyptian lawyers' awakening and national 
uprising, which history will record came after the assassination 
of 'Abd-al-Harith Madani." The lawyers affirmed, the report 
says, that "the regime" is making "overt" attempts to 
"discourage" the lawyers and "bury their revolution" and that 
they will not forget their "primary motive," the murder of their 
colleague, lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani. 
<H5>  HUMAN RIGHTS BODY PROTESTS MILITARY TRIBUNALS, EXECUTIONS </H5>
  An approximately 350-word report on pages 1 and 7 says the 
Egyptian Human Rights Organization [EHRO] has issued a statement 
on the trial of 17 defendants charged with the attempted 
assassination of Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi, The statement 
expresses concern over the continued military trials. The 
report adds that the EHRO "notes its regret that its repeated 
appeals to the Egyptian authorities to stop referring civilians 
to military courts and to stop enforcing sentences passed by 
these courts have not met response." 
  The organization appeals to all "civil society institutions" 
and all Arab and world human rights organizations to urge the 
Egyptian authorities to stop these military tribunals. 
<H5>  ARTICLE URGES IMPROVED RELATIONS WITH SUDAN </H5>
  An approximately 1,800-word article on page 2 by Major 
General Tal'at Musallam discusses the current deterioration of 
Egyptian- Sudanese ties, reviewing each side's claims and 
accusations against the other. Urging improved relations 
between the two countries by consolidating previous bilateral 
accords, the author asserts the need to insure Sudan's 
territorial integrity and for Egypt not to support any 
resolution placing Sudan on the list of countries sponsoring 
terrorism. He notes that the contentious points between the two 
countries include the Hala'ib border dispute, mutual media 
propaganda, and Egypt's refusal in April to extradite the 
hijacker of a Sudanese plane. 
<H5>  COURT HEARING OF LAWYERS CASE REPORTED </H5>
  Page 3 of AL-SHA'B features an approximately 700-word report 
by Khalid Yunus on the Southern Cairo Court's session "last 
Thursday," in which the court extended the detention of the 
lawyers arrested in connection with the Bar Association 
demonstration. Yunus says thousands of lawyers as well as the 
detainees' families assembled in the court yard and that anger 
and enthusiasm gripped everyone, who shouted slogans like "Long 
live the Bar Association" and "Prison has never changed a 
thought." He adds that hundreds of Central Security Forces 
personnel were deployed inside the court equipped with tear gas 
bombs and rubber bullets, poised to "repeat the tragedy of 
striking against the lawyers inside their association on 17 May." 
  The reporter says that a defense lawyer moved that the items 
seized at the site of the lawyers' arrest are not proof of a 
crime. The items included a video cassette of a debate at a book 
fair two years ago between Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali, Dr. 
Muhammad 'Amarah, and Dr. Faraj Fudah, a video cassette on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and another cassette on Afghanistan. 
  The reporter adds that the doyen of Lawyers Ahmad 
al-Khawajah 
in his defense statement denied that the Muslim Brotherhood 
members of the Bar Association had prompted the lawyers to 
demonstrate or that "overzealous" young lawyers had accused the 
association of inaction and demanded "serious moves." 
<H5>  WRITER CRITICIZES ORGANIZATION OF NATIONAL DIALOGUE </H5>
  On page 5, AL-SHA'B publishes an approximately 2,000-word 
article by Dr. Muhammad Hilmi Murad, who criticizes the ruling 
National Democratic Party's call for a national dialogue and its 
organization of the dialogue. The writer says there is an 
intention to "overstep" the role of the preparatory committee of 
the dialogue and "jump" directly to convening the conference 
without prior agreement among the parties concerned on the tasks 
entrusted with them. 
  He adds that by specifying the "legitimate" national forces 
who are to take part in the dialogue, the ruling party 
disparages the Muslim Brotherhood as an organization. But, he 
continues, it is inconceivable that the ruling party will 
exclude from the dialogue all leading personalities in Islamic 
thought who act as individuals and intellectuals, or al-Azhar 
University in its capacity as a cultural institution with an 
Islamic character. Murad notes: "The Constitution, which is 
currently intended to be violated, stipulates that Islam is the 
national religion and that the Islamic shari'ah principles are 
the primary guides for legislation. Naturally, nothing prevents 
the participation of anyone who represents the Christian 
intellectual trend." 
<H5>  MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD OFFICIAL URGES NO CONFRONTATION </H5>
  Muslim Brotherhood Deputy General Guide Mustafa Mashhur 
writes a 2,000-word article on page 5, noting the "artificial 
security and media campaign" against the Muslim Brotherhood and 
urging patience. (Text filed as NC1106152694 and adds) 
<H5>  OFFICIALS ASSERT AL-GHAZALI NOT BANNED FROM SPEECHES </H5>
  A 170-word report on the same page says that after "the 
public's overwhelming anger," officials "rushed" to meet Shaykh 
Muhammad al- Ghazali to assert to him that he was not banned 
from making speeches. 
  The report adds that the interior minister met Shaykh 
al-Ghazali "last week" and affirmed to him before "television 
and press cameras" that the Interior Ministry views him with 
"every appreciation and respect and that it would be nonsensical 
for the ministry to ban his speeches." This week, the report 
says, the Awqaf minister visited al-Ghazali at his home and 
confirmed to him that his ministry has nothing to do with 
banning him from speeches. 
<H5>  IRAN'S VELAYATI VIEWS TIES WITH ARABS, TERRORISM, BOSNIA </H5>
  Page 6 features a 1,800-word interview with Iranian Foreign 
Minister Velayati, who discusses relations with the Arabs, 
terrorism, and Bosnia-Herzegovina. (Text filed as NC1006160594 
and adds) 
<H5>  ARTICLE VIEWS CAMPAIGN AGAINST ISLAMISTS, MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD </H5>
  In an approximately 1,000-word article on page 7, the 
author, 
Dr. Majdi Qarqar, discuses campaign against Muslim Brotherhood 
leaders and the "Islamic trend." (Text filed as NC1106181794 
and add) 
<H5>  WRITER NOTES ANTI-ISLAM POLICY IN TUNISIA </H5>
  In an approximately 1,800-word article on page 8, Lutfi 
Bin-Ramadan reviews Tunisian-Algerian relations. He notes that 
the "ruling secular elite" in Tunisia is aware that its "war of 
annihilation" against the Islamic movement cannot end up in its 
favor in "an Arab and Islamic environment permeated by Islamic 
awakening and in an international environment quickly heading 
toward democracy." Therefore, he says, the Tunisian "regime" 
took the "fight against fundamentalism as an ideology to all 
international forums." 
  The writer says that the situation in Algeria has confused 
the Tunisian regime and made it lose its balance so badly that 
it will be difficult to predict the regime's behavior should the 
Islamists take power in Algeria. He notes three possibilities: 
First, the Tunisian regime may open up to the Islamic 
opposition, free its prisoners, and restore democracy. The 
author dismisses this possibility because the "ruling elite" is 
"indulging in hostility to Islam as a religion." The second 
possibility is that it will concentrate on the economic aspect, 
the flow of Western financial aid, and turn a blind eye to "the 
laundering of drug money." The third option is that Tunisia 
might play the same role the "Iraqi regime" played in the 
Iranian revolution. This option does not exclude the 
possibility of Tunisia turning into a "base where foreign 
forces--especially the French who are linked with the Tunisian 
regime by a joint defense pact--would assemble." 
<H5>  EUROPEAN RACIST POLICIES AGAINST ARAB, MUSLIM MIGRANTS CITED </H5>
  An approximately 900-word report on page 8 by Muhammad Jamal 
'Arafah discusses European countries' recent measures to 
restrict the flow of foreign emigrants, especially Arabs and 
Muslims. The reporter cites regulations in many European 
countries to reduce the number of Arab and Muslim migrants, 
deport some of them, and incorporate others in the "fabric" of 
these countries. 
<H5>  AL-GHAZALI NOTES NEED TO IMPLEMENT `DIVINE INJUNCTIONS' </H5>
  AL-SHA'B publishes on page 12 a 380-word article written by 
Muhammad al-Ghazali, who criticizes a television debate by three 
intellectuals on the books and views of some late Islamic 
intellectuals. 
  Commenting on the debate, al-Ghazali says that blocking 
"God's ruling is a crime" and notes the need to implement 
"divine injunctions and curb human whims."

    [Editorial Report] The following is a comprehensive reiview 
of all items in the 7 June issue of the Arabic-language 
newspaper Cairo 'AQIDATI that pertain to political Islamic 
issues. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Sports Gambling Against Shari'ah 
  2. Appeal Made To Help Muslim Refugees 
  3. Youth Camp To Discuss Issues Facing Muslims 
  4. Writer Berates West's Stance on Islam 
  5. Al-Ghazali Urges Youth To Defend Islam 
  6. Writer Claims West Continues Plots Against Islam 
  7. Universities Prepare Summer Activities 
  8. Rich Saudis Build Islamic Complex in Uzbekistan 
<H5>  SPORTS GAMBLING AGAINST SHARI'AH </H5>
  The lead story on page 1 is a 100-word summary of a fatwa 
[religious edict] by the mufti and the Ifta' Council that 
betting on soccer matches is against religious law. A 
1,700-word question and answer article on pages 8 and 9 rules on 
various issues raised by readers. One of them deals with the 
ruling highlighted on page 1, namely that betting on soccer 
matches is against shari'ah and appeals to "all Arab fans of 
soccer not to undertake this illegal gambling and to protect the 
traditions of Islam and its shari'ah and the Muslims' reputation 
in the world." The other rulings cover such topics as the use 
of foreign words such as "bye-bye" in Friday sermons, which is 
regarded as a sin; the illegality of marrying a stepdaughter; 
and the rules for marrying a divorced woman. Another ruling 
comes out against the use of any medicine where alcohol has been 
used in its manufacturing unless there is no alternative 
medicine. 
<H5>  APPEAL MADE TO HELP MUSLIM REFUGEES </H5>
  A 100-word summary on page 1 reports on an appeal from the 
governing body of the Higher Islamic Council for Propagation and 
Relief to the heads of Islamic countries urging more aid to 
Muslim refugees, who make up more than 90 percent of the 
refugees in the world. The council also appeals to the leaders 
of the major powers, the pope, and the UN secretary general to 
take urgent action to stop the Serbian attacks on Bosnia's 
Muslims and lift the arms embargo imposed on the latter so that 
they can defend themselves. The appeal to help Muslim refugees 
is further elaborated on in a 900- word report by Jamal Salim on 
page 20. The report says the appeal calls for allocating fixed 
financial and material aid to help alleviate the sufferings of 
Muslim refugees and also appeals to rich Muslims to help their 
brothers. Council Chairman Shaykh Jad al-Haqq 'Ali Jad-al-Haqq 
calls on world Muslim relief societies "to visit relief sites 
for those harmed and for the needy and to give increasing care 
to modern field studies, to use documented data when making 
decisions, and to coordinate their work to save their efforts 
and avoid duplication." After calling for diversifying the 
types of relief, he underlines the importance of "abiding by 
humanitarian principles in relief without racial, religious, 
ethnic, or political affiliation discrimination and to be 
completely neutral." Dr. Farid Qirshi, chairman of the 
council's relief department, then reviews the council's 
achievements in Bosnia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Burma, Somalia, 
Sudan, Kurdistan, Sri Lanka, India, and the independent states 
and then details some of the projects that the council is 
preparing to help alleviate the suffering of refugees. 
<H5>  YOUTH CAMP TO DISCUSS ISSUES FACING MUSLIMS </H5>
  A 150-word report by Muhammad al-Abnudi on page 2 says that 
the Abu-Bakr al-Siddiq Camp organized by the Higher Council for 
Islamic Affairs will be held in Alexandria on 19 July and will 
be attended by youth delegations from more than 20 Islamic 
countries. It adds that the delegations will discuss a number 
of religious and other issues facing the Muslim world, including 
the need to fight corrupt ideas. 
<H5>  WRITER BERATES WEST'S STANCE ON ISLAM </H5>
  A 450-word article by Basyuni al-Halawani in the "With All 
Frankness" column on page 6 welcomes recent statements by 
Western officials that praise Islam, the shari'ah, and its 
tolerant principles, adding that these are a gain for Islam and 
the Muslims' just causes and could effectively help "rectify the 
wrong and misleading image that has been projected by the 
extremist groups through their rejected actions and alien ideas 
that have nothing to do with Islam at all." But he notes that 
these statements by Western officials do not reflect a clear 
Western stance on Islam and the Muslims' causes, adding that the 
Western media continues to implement a scheme to distort the 
image of Islam while Western countries are not changing their 
negative stances, which emphasize their support for all the 
extremist and racist movements against Islam. 
  The writer then adds: "If it is the view of U.S. President 
Bill Clinton's adviser that Islam is a call for tolerance and 
dialogue and that it does not pose a danger to other nations and 
civilizations, then what has the U.S. Administration done to 
restore the Muslims' usurped rights and lift the yoke of the 
clear injustice imposed on our Muslim brothers in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, India, Palestine, and other areas of 
conflict in the world?" He then criticizes Britain's attitude 
toward the Muslims' causes after citing Prince Charles' 
statements that Islam is full of the meanings of love, 
brotherhood, and equality. He adds that "while we are happy 
with these statements, we fear that they might be part of the 
constant deceptions and plots against the Muslim world," noting 
that the West alone cannot be blamed for this but also the 
"Muslim countries that have accepted the role of the spectator 
and have agreed to be pawns in a chess game controlled by the 
West." Noting that Muslims' conditions are getting worse, he 
urges them to return to Islam's principles and the shari'ah in 
their dealings and in resolving their conflicts. 
<H5>  AL-GHAZALI URGES YOUTH TO DEFEND ISLAM </H5>
  A 350-word report on page 10 details a seminar organized by 
the Islamic and Arab Documentation and Studies Center in al-Fath 
Mosque in Ramsis [Cairo] under the slogan: "The role of the 
youth between the past and the present." It cites Shaykh 
Muhammad al-Ghazali as telling the participants that the nation 
needs the youth to hold the banner and defend Islam against the 
forces hostile to it. He adds that: "The Islamic nation is in 
dire need for those who will rejuvenate its religion and youth 
and this can only be done by renewing its faith, resources, and 
moral and material talents." He says that he is worried about 
today's youth who are led by their sexual desires while the 
nation needs the youth guided by faith and ideals. Another 
speaker, Dr. 'Ali Jum'ah, adviser to the World Institute of 
Islamic Thinking in Cairo, says that the problem today is that 
youth are getting science and data confused, believing that 
obtaining some data makes them scholars. 
<H5>  WRITER CLAIMS WEST CONTINUES PLOTS AGAINST ISLAM </H5>
  A 450-word article by Majdi Salim in the "God is Merciful" 
column on page 10 argues that the West is continuing its plots 
against the Muslim world. He says that this plot is implemented 
on three tracks. The first one is the economic war that aims to 
"restrict our strength, exploit our natural resources, and limit 
our ability to use them to build an independent economic 
structure." He adds that the West uses people from among us as 
tools to implement this plot and to turn Islamic society into a 
consumer one. The second track is an intellectual one, where 
the West tries to impose its ideas and concepts on us "on the 
pretext of liberating our minds from restrictions and 
enlightening us to make us move away from Islam's tenets and our 
true religion, which represents for them the main obstacle in 
their struggle with the Islamic nation so that the Western way 
of life becomes ours, too." He argues that the West is also 
using tools from among us to achieve this aim. He then moves to 
the third track, which is the military one, citing the cases of 
Bosnia, Burma, Afghanistan, and now Yemen. He concludes that 
"this is a plot and we do not believe it no matter how much the 
West claims to support or back us and our only course is to hold 
onto the rope of God, understand, and get ready." 
<H5>  UNIVERSITIES PREPARE SUMMER ACTIVITIES </H5>
  A 1,300-word report on page 19 by Salah 'Abd-al-Mu'ti 
details 
the programs prepared by various universities and colleges for 
their students during the summer holidays. Saying that the 
students are free to participate in the programs they like, the 
report adds that this year's plans include holding seminars and 
dialogues with students in the summer camps in addition to 
health enlightenment convoys that will travel to villages and 
action programs for students' participation in the development 
of villages. The report says that the Cairo University program 
varies between artistic, cultural, and sports activities and 
that part of these activities will tour the governorates. The 
report adds that al-Azhar University will organize religious 
enlightenment convoys that will tour the governorates, cities, 
and villages, especially in Upper Egypt, where leading teachers 
will lecture on the principles of religion and propagation. 
Meanwhile, Alexandria University will organize courses for 
teaching professional skills such as plumbing, tiling, and 
mechanics. Al-Minufiyah University's activities will focus on 
scientific training, such electronics, biology, and environment. 
Hulwan University's emphasis will be on various activities, 
such as computer training, the teaching of the English language, 
and chess tournaments. 
  The report goes on to say that al-Minya University will 
focus 
its activities on combating illiteracy and opening summer clubs 
to attract the young, in addition to science courses and sports. 
Asyut University's main activity will be "the friends of the 
police program, which will be the first of its kind and in which 
500 students will participate in cooperation with the security 
directorate." Other activities include a forestry project, 
combating illiteracy, electricity training, and manual 
handicrafts for female students. Tanta University, the report 
concludes, will focus on a health survey of the governorate. 
<H5>  SAUDIS BUILD ISLAMIC COMPLEX IN UZBEKISTAN </H5>
  A 400-word report on page 21 says that Islam Karimov, 
president of Uzbekistan, agreed to a demand from rich persons 
from Mecca to allocate a piece of land measuring 20,000 meters 
in the middle of Tashkent to build an Islamic center complex. 
The report adds that the complex will include a mosque that can 
accommodate 10,000 worshipers, an Islamic clinic, an Islamic 
library, a workshop for girls, and an Islamic studies center. 
It notes that the first stage of the project has already 
started and that the overall cost will be around $5 million.

  [Text] The national budget for the next fiscal year has 
been announced. Finance Minister Saifur Rahman presented the 
budget for 1994-95 and the supplementary budget for the outgoing 
1993-94 in the Jatiya Sangsad [parliament] this afternoon. 
  The total outlay of the budget for the next fiscal year 
divided into revenue and development budgets amounted to 24,637 
core taka. The revenue budget shows a surplus of 3,689 crore 
taka. Revenue receipts for the next fiscal year are estimated 
at 13,637 crore taka; this is about 11 percent higher than the 
revised estimate of the current year. Tax revenue will 
contribute 10,625 crore taka. Nontax revenue is expected to show 
a healthy rise of 25.5 percent over the revised estimate for the 
outgoing fiscal year to 3,012 crore taka. Revenue expenditure 
for 1994-95 is estimated at 9,948 crore taka, which is 8.7 
percent higher than the revised figure for 1993-94. 
  Allocations to priority sectors such as education, health 
and 
family welfare, irrigation, and flood control have been 
increased significantly. After adjusting for capital and food 
accounts, net contribution to the ADP [annual development 
program] from the revenue budget is expected to be 3,996 crore 
taka. The voluntary separation program will continue in the 
next fiscal year, for which 300 crore taka has been provided 
for. An ADP of 11,000 crore taka has been proposed for 1994-95; 
this is an increase of 14.5 percent over the revised ADP for the 
current fiscal year. 
  Taking into account the projects proposed under the Food for 
Work Program outside the ADP, the total public sector investment 
will stand at 11,513 crore taka. Thirty-eight percent of the 
fiscal year's ADP is estimated to be financed from the country's 
own resources. This clearly demonstrates the present 
government's success in reducing aid dependency to promote our 
cherished goal of a self-reliant Bangladesh. 
  Pursuing the government's policy of allocating resources to 
priority sectors that directly or indirectly contribute to 
poverty alleviation and human resources development, the 
proposed budget provided larger funds to several sectors. Of 
them, education will get 1,556 crore taka, the highest 
allocation. It is an increase of nearly 60 percent over the 
current fiscal year. Health and family welfare will receive 20 
percent increase over 1993-94 of 893 crore taka. Rural 
electrification, rural infrastructure, livestock, and fisheries 
-- the sectors which can fast contribute to economic growth and 
simultaneously alleviate poverty -- will all get higher 
allocations compared to the outgoing fiscal year. Social 
welfare, women, and youth will also have significant increase. 
The budget has provided 183 crore taka for this sector. 
  The finance minister also placed in parliament the revised 
and supplementary budget for the outgoing 1993-94 fiscal year. 
In the revised budget, revenue receipts have been estimated at 
12,280 crore taka and the revenue expenditure is 9,150 crore 
taka. The restraint upon the current expenditure has yielded 
higher surplus to finance the ADP. The size of the revised ADP 
has been kept at 9,600 crore taka, which is 18 percent higher 
than the previous year's revised ADP. 
  The sectors that received additional allocations in the 
revised ADP are education, 275 crore taka; rural infrastructure, 
125 crore taka; rural electrification, 100 crore taka; and roads 
and highways, 220 crore taka. Besides, an additional amount of 
444 crore taka has been provided for the Jamuna Multipurpose 
Bridge. It is important to note that domestic resources are 
contributing 35.8 percent of the revised ADP, a major step 
toward economic self-reliance. 
  Spelling the main objectives of the budget, the finance 
minister said the integral components of the government's 
broader strategy for the medium term is to achieve a GDP growth 
rate of around 6 percent, to contain inflation and fiscal 
deficit, and reduce aid dependence. Other objectives included 
enhancing mobilization of domestic savings, investments, and 
promoting self- reliance. He said the government plans to raise 
the growth rate of GDP to 6-7 percent in the near term while 
aiming at a double-digit growth before the turn of the century. 
This would require raising the aggregate level of investment 
from the present level of 14.5 to 16 percent in the immediate 
future, eventually reaching 20 percent of the GDP. 
  Mr. Saifur Rahman said the cornerstone of the government's 
development strategy is to improve the quality and productivity 
of public investments with emphasis on social sectors. He said 
the BNP [Bangladesh Nationalist Party] government has entered 
the fourth year of its term and it is appropriate to take an 
objective look at the government's performances during these 
three years. The finance minister said growth rate of GDP has 
improved; the country is expected to show a modest level of 5 
percent growth this year. 
  Turning to the rural economy, he said a quiet revolution is 
under way and it is not only generating economic growth from new 
sources but also transforming the composition of production, 
consumption, and employment. Mr. Saifur Rahman said housing is 
an important growth sector and the House Building Finance 
Corporation has been made fully operational to cater to the 
needs of the people. It is expected to sanction 500 crore taka 
for house building loans next year. 
  The finance minister announced further incentives for 
agricultural growth by reducing the prices of kerosene and 
diesel by one taka per liter and furnace oil by about 3,000 taka 
per metric ton. The government has further decided to lower the 
urea fertilizer price by 350 taka per metric ton. 
  The finance minister, while giving details of the fiscal 
measures proposed in the new budget, said these are primarily 
aimed at giving relief to the people as well as infuse dynamism 
in the national economy. He said due care has also been taken 
to bring about specific structural changes in the taxation 
system and make it more scientific to (?cope) with the changing 
global economic scenario. Mr. Saifur Rahman proposed reduction 
of existing taxes and duties on a large number of essential 
items, including edible oil, sugar, cotton, and cotton yarn. 
Taxes were reduced on 148 basic raw materials and 1,024 
industrial raw materials, hides and skins, crockery, low-lift 
pumps, power tillers, medical equipment and appliances, wood and 
wood products, TV, locally produced construction material, 
scientific instruments, sports gear, bicycles, telephone 
equipment, stamp charge on registration of land, and materials 
used in dairy farms. He also announced a total abolition of 
duties on the import of improved breed of cattle from abroad. 
  The finance minister has also proposed increase of duties 
and 
taxes on a few items to help encourage their increased 
production in the country. In this connection, he proposed 7.5 
percent duty on globe and atlas, 15 percent increase on cut 
flower, and 15 percent supplementary duty on gray portland 
cement. He also proposed to raise duty on MS [mild steel] 
billet from 15 to 30 percent and duty rate on certain tobacco 
and tobacco products will also be increased, depending on their 
prices. Passengers traveling abroad would be required to pay 50 
taka per head in addition to the existing travel tax. However, 
all surcharges and levies for Jamuna Bridge have been withdrawn. 
  The finance minister said the new fiscal measures are in the 
line of the present democratic government's commitment to ensure 
welfare of the people through the adoption of various pragmatic 
measures. The new measures will also go a long way in further 
strengthening of the national economy. He said due to the 
reduction in taxes and duties in a large number of daily-use 
[items], the total loss to the national exchequer will stand at 
437 crore taka while the new fiscal measures will fetch only 55 
crore taka. The finance minister said the shortfall thus 
created will be met through appropriate administrative measures 
including intensified drive to realize arrear revenues, curb the 
propensity of avoidance and evasion through enforcing the 
existing provisions of law, introduction of computer processing 
in Dhaka and Chittagong Customs Houses and the income tax 
offices. 
  Mr. Saifur Rahman, giving an account of the present-day 
world 
economic order, said we will have to complete the reform process 
initiated by the present government. We must also build a 
political consciousness in favor of these reformative measures 
which will help the country achieve self-reliance through 
increased mobilization of domestic resources. The finance 
minister later introduced the Finance Bill 1994 in an amended 
form. The bill envisages enforcement of the government's fiscal 
proposals and amends certain laws. 
  Our parliamentary representatives says President Abdur 
Rahman 
Biswas, the chief of the Army and the Navy, diplomats, elites, 
members of the diplomatic corps, and high civil and military 
officials were among those present in the Sangsad during the 
presentation of the new budget by the finance minister. The 
members of the opposition were, however, absent. The house will 
meet again on Sunday next [12 June] at 1630 in the afternoon.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Inclination To Normalize Relations </F>
Between Cairo and Iran"] 
  [Excerpt] Cairo, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Political sources in 
Cairo have revealed an Egyptian-Iranian inclination to normalize 
relations after tension that has lasted 10 years. 
  This inclination comes in the wake of the first official 
visit to Cairo by Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati, 
during which he attended the Nonaligned Movement conference and 
met with his Egyptian opposite number 'Amr Musa. They discussed 
issues of common concern on the Islamic and Arab scenes. 
  Well-informed sources stressed that important developments 
in 
relations between Egypt and Iran indicate that positive steps 
are expected to be taken soon, but it depends on the results of 
the coming days. 
  Diplomatic sources have pointed to the two countries' 
endeavors to open a new page in relations based on surmounting 
the points of disagreement, working to eliminate them, and 
bolstering the issues agreed upon, especially what concerns the 
two sides on the regional and international scene, in particular 
Islamic issues and nonalignment. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 3 Jun (MENA)--The newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH 
has affirmed that President Husni Mubarak has defined clear and 
stable principles governing Egypt's Arab and international 
relations. It said that some of the most important principles 
are mutual respect, non-interference in the internal affairs of 
others, and respect for the privacy of each state. 
  The newspaper clarified in a comment today that Egypt is 
keen 
on extending bridges of friendship and cooperation with all 
countries and people within the framework of these principles. 
  The newspaper said that throughout history, Egypt has 
maintained relations of cooperation and brotherhood with the 
fraternal Sudanese people as a result of an imposed geographic 
reality that cannot be changed. However, there is also a joint 
factor that has preserved the lives of the two peoples since 
time immemorial: the immortal Nile River. 
  The newspaper added that Egypt has always cooperated with 
the 
successive Sudanese governments in private projects to maximize 
use of and benefits from the waters of the Nile to serve 
agricultural development in the two fraternal countries. 
  The newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH continues: And as the great Nile 
River kept its promises throughout history and provided the two 
fraternal people in Egypt and Sudan with their water needs, 
Egypt also kept its promises in cooperating with Sudan to 
exploit the waters, irrespective of who took over power in 
Khartoum. Egypt always adhered to a firm principle which is 
that when it deals with Sudan, it deals first and foremost with 
a fraternal people. 
  The newspaper affirmed that Egypt has always stood alongside 
united Sudan, from the deep south to the extreme north. Egypt 
believes that Sudan is the natural hinterland of Egypt without 
any discrimination, and perhaps also without any account-keeping. 
  The newspaper expressed its regret that many things have 
changed in Khartoum, particularly inside the Sudanese 
Government, which is in coalition with the former Oxford 
student-transformed imam, who wants to rule Sudan with fire and 
steel in the name of Islam and religion, while Islam has 
absolutely nothing to do with it. 
  Concluding its comment, the newspaper said that we view our 
relations with Sudan in a grander way than Imam al-Turabi views 
this relationship. He wants to destroy relations with Egypt. 
The paper affirmed that these relations are relations between 
two fraternal people linked geographically and historically with 
each other. The two peoples will not allow these historic and 
geographic relations between them to be harmed in any way.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Isam 'Abd-al-Jawad] </F>
  [Text] The security forces in Asyut have foiled a 
terrorist plan in Sidfa led by a number of illiterate peasants. 
The security forces foiled another plan in al-Badari last 
week. This is the first time that the security forces have 
uncovered a terrorist organization that was planning to carry 
out terrorist operations in Sidfa and outside that did not 
involve university- and school-educated people. The security 
forces arrested 19 people, including 14 of the leaders of the 
military organization in Sidfa that was involved in the 
implementation of terrorist operations in Sidfa and Abu Tij. 
Four members of the same organization were killed in Tima in an 
exchange of fire with the security forces. 
  ROSE AL-YUSUF has learned that the Sidfa organization was 
more accurate in the implementation of its operations and the 
selection of its members, whose identity was difficult to 
uncover. It planned its operations from a cave in Tima, in 
Suhaj Governorate, which was difficult to reach. The 
organization members established training camps for their 
operations in the Tima desert. 
  A security source in Asyut has said that the new 
organization 
was dangerous because all its members were illiterate peasants 
who are not so easy to uncover. The organization was led by 
Anwar Hashim Muhammad, 23, who is accused of involvement in more 
than one murder case. 
  The source added that the security forces have arrested 14 
members of the military organization without any resistance. 
But four members escaped to Tima, in Suhaj, to prepare for new 
terrorist operations. The security forces, in conjunction with 
the state security in Suhaj, discovered their whereabouts and 
killed them following an exchange of fire. 
  The security forces, accompanied by armored vehicles 
equipped 
with Goryunov machine guns, cordoned off the eastern areas from 
al-Badari to the border of the Suhaj Governorate in one of the 
largest combing operations in the area to find other members of 
the military organization in al-Badari. Large forces were also 
combing the mountainous areas of Sidfa and Abu Tij from the west. 
  The security authorities in Suhaj are deploying large forces 
at the northern entry and exit points of Asyut and are combing 
areas in Tima and Juhaynah that are close to Asyut in a pincers 
operation. 
  A security source denied a claim by the popular 
organizations 
in Asyut that they can deliver Rif'at Zaydan [not further 
identified] within two months. The security source affirmed 
that the popular organizations know nothing about Zaydan because 
he frequently changes his identity and hideouts, and this claim 
is a new attempt by these organizations to win over public 
opinion. Only the security forces are able to identify his 
location and arrest him, and this is expected to take place 
within days.

  [Text] Cairo, 13 Jun (MENA)--Interior Minister Hasan 
al-Alfi has expressed surprise at the interpellation submitted 
by a People's Assembly member against him regarding violations 
of human rights and maltreatment of citizens and lawyers. 
  In his answer to the interpellation by independent deputy 
Kamal Khalid this evening, the interior minister said that Egypt 
enjoys the brightest era of democracy and its prudent leadership 
is now sponsoring a national dialogue to shape a safer, more 
stable, and prosperous future. He noted that calls for the 
protection of human rights are out of place in Egypt, adding 
that those who make such calls are encouraged by foreign 
quarters. 
  The interior minister pointed out that what the government 
has done to provide security and safety cannot be ignored, 
adding that preserving security and stability is our duty. He 
noted that the government, using legal and decisive measures, 
has confronted a conspiracy concocted by a group of wrongdoers 
who have deviated from the correct path and thought that they 
could undermine the people's accomplishments. The government 
has succeeded in curbing the threat of terrorism, he added, 
noting that the security agencies' measures against it has 
reflected the will of the people and that the verdicts passed by 
the Egyptian judiciary categorically condemned terrorism and all 
those who advocate it. 
  The interior minister pointed out that in 1993 and the past 
months of 1994 the Interior Ministry's agencies have thwarted a 
serious threat against society, legitimacy, and the security of 
the homeland and the people. During this period, he added, 257 
terrorist cases involving 1,802 terrorists have been uncovered, 
thanks to the sound scientific planning, high-level performance, 
and extraordinary efforts of policemen. He noted that the 
interpellator's claims of violations of human rights are a clear 
omission of the facts and of the evils of extremism. He added: 
Let me remind the interpellator of the guarantees provided in 
the Constitution regarding human rights, the protection of the 
people's security and stability, and the procedures followed in 
prisons, which are under the full supervision and control of the 
judicial authorities. 
  Minister al-Alfi referred to the statement issued by the 
majority of members of the Lawyers Association in which they 
denounced the attempt by a few members who belong to the Muslim 
Brotherhood to control the association, adding that these 
members support terrorism. He noted that the interpellation 
refers to incidents involving some arrested lawyers. He added 
that these incidents are being investigated by prosecutors, who 
have decided to remand the defendants, 12 of whom are not 
lawyers, in custody. He asked: Did the deputy submit his 
interpellation because the government is doing its job in 
implementing the law and respecting the judiciary? He added: 
As for the question of the arrested lawyers, it falls within 
the jurisdiction of the judiciary. Al-Alfi noted that the 
memorandum attached to the interpellation elaborated about the 
question of mediation between the government and terrorists. 
The minister asked: What mediation does it refer to and why at 
this particular time? He added: The question of mediation 
between the government and terrorists has long since been 
settled; there is no room for mediation between legitimacy and 
illegitimacy. In the face of extremism and those supporting it, 
there will be nothing but extremely firm legal confrontation 
without hesitation, he added. 
  The interior minister spoke about the circumstances 
surrounding the recent death of 'Abd-al-Harith Madani. He said 
that investigations into and information about the explosions in 
some banks proved that the dead lawyer played a major role in 
the illicit activities and that he received organizational 
instructions directly from the terrorist Tal'at Yasin Hammam. 
The prosecution issued a warrant for his arrest. The defendant 
was arrested in his house in al-Haram and informed of the 
prosecution's warrant. Upon searching his home in al-Haram, a 
number of important papers were found. 
  He said that when the late lawyer was taken to his other 
house for it to be searched, he suffered from difficulty in 
breathing and was taken to al-Manyal Hospital for first aid 
treatment; he died there. The diagnosis showed that the cause 
of death was a severe asthmatic attack. 
  He noted that some defendants admitted the organizational 
role the dead lawyer had played; he was the direct link with 
Tal'at Yasin Hammam for transmitting orders among the leaders of 
the organization from inside and outside prison. He exploited 
the nature of his work as a lawyer. 
  He also received funding from the organization amounting to 
45,000 Egyptian pounds, with $3,000 to spend for organizational 
purposes. 
  The interior minister said that the brother of the dead 
lawyer, Salah Madani, also belongs to the terrorist organization 
and is a defendant in one of the terrorist cases. 
  On the action by the Lawyers' Association after the lawyer's 
death, the interior minister said that we monitored some 
suspicious moves by the association that increased day by day, 
even after the official announcement about the circumstances 
surrounding the death. In fact, some lawyers tried to contact 
other associations for incitement purposes, but these did not 
respond. Hasan al-Alfi added that we are sure that there was a 
premeditated attempt to create sedition and riot. In 
particular, a number of people who gathered on the streets threw 
bricks and stones from behind the fences. After that, a number 
of the people walked out on the street. In addition, the police 
received information that some lawyers were armed. 
  The interior minister repeated that the security organs were 
quite tolerant of all the practices that were considered wrong, 
especially since most of the legitimate means were open to the 
lawyers and association members to make their demands known and 
pose their questions. But a small group of members violated 
legitimacy by attacking the regime. 
  He pointed out that 48 individuals were arrested, 12 of whom 
were not lawyers. The prosecution charged them with many 
things, such as participating in a criminal act with the 
objective to commit crimes of mobbing, demonstrating, attacking 
the authorities, hampering them in performing their duties by 
using force and intimidation, organizing a demonstration against 
the law, as well as spreading false statements to disturb public 
peace and possessing publications that incite demonstration. 
  The interior minister affirmed that no extraordinary 
measures 
were taken to confront the situation. The entire situation has 
been presented to the investigating bodies. He added that no 
one is above the law, despite the fact that the defendants are 
lawyers. He clarified that there is no alternative to 
legitimacy and that every violation will be firmly confronted 
with force. 
  However, false allegations will not terrorize us and we will 
not back down on our responsibilities before God and the people, 
he added. We shall not hesitate because our unwavering option 
is Egypt itself. 
  The interior minister noted that 120 defendants have been 
arrested in connection with the terrorist organization connected 
to the terrorist Tal'at Yasin Hammam. 
  The People's Assembly then proceeded to discuss its agenda 
upon a request signed by 35 members. The Interior Ministry was 
thanked for its efforts.

<F P=106> [Editorial by chief editor Ibrahim Sa'dah: "Human Rights at </F>
Auction"] 
  [Text] A motley group of agencies and organizations have 
come into being with a vocation, which they swear is sincere and 
disinterested, in human rights. Their sole aim, they would have 
us believe, is to comfort a persecuted humanity and extract its 
rights from the claws of tyrants and despots. They make such 
claims undeterred by the fact that in several cases the opposite 
has been proved; namely, that those defenders of human rights 
tend to lose interest in their cause once their motives 
disappear. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton has every right to declare 
himself the best known, staunchest, and mightiest of all human 
rights defenders. 
  Bill Clinton's story with human rights goes back a long way. 
It began with his decision to run in the U.S. presidential 
elections, challenging the incumbent President George Bush who 
was running for a second term. At the time, Bush was still 
basking in the Gulf war victory, a battle which he planned and 
directed from A to Z, a triumph that brought happiness to the 
U.S. people and went a long way toward healing the Vietnam 
trauma. 
  Clinton, aware that Bush anchored his election campaign on 
his foreign policy accomplishments, based his own strategy on 
exaggerating Bush's failures in domestic policy. Aiming a swipe 
at Bush's foreign policy, he denounced Bush's dealings with 
dictatorial regimes that persecute their people and govern them 
with iron and fire. 
  Throughout his campaign, Clinton bemoaned the pitiful human 
rights situation in many countries, vowing that, if he were to 
become president, he would end U.S. cooperation with dictatorial 
governments regardless of how important their countries may be 
for U.S. interests. 
  Clinton accused Bush openly of turning a blind eye to human 
rights abuses and of supporting dictatorial regimes and 
providing them with assistance. More specifically, Clinton 
mentioned China by name and pointed out that President Bush 
ignored the massacre of Chinese students at the hands of the 
government forces when they demonstrated for freedom and human 
rights on 3 June 1989. Clinton said that Bush extended a hand 
of cooperation to the Chinese Government and conferred upon it 
the most-favored nation [MFN] status instead of imposing 
economic sanctions on it until it upholds freedoms and human 
rights. 
  Then Clinton won the White House's Oval Office from George 
Bush. Some days after he became President, it was time to renew 
or abolish China's MFN status. Clinton could not back down on 
his human rights slogan but at the same time could not ignore 
U.S. interests which would suffer if the relationship with China 
deteriorated. As a compromise, he issued a decision linking 
China's continued enjoyment of its MFN status with improvement 
in its human rights record. He gave it until June 1994. 
  Clinton was hoping that a change would occur in Beijing to 
give the impression that democracy had begun to knock on China's 
Great Wall. In this way he would fulfill his promise to the 
U.S. voters with regard to imposing respect for human rights 
worldwide, particularly in the People's Republic of China. 
  Unfortunately for Clinton, the Chinese Government denounced 
the U.S. administration's statements and maintained that any 
discussion of so-called human rights inside China would be seen 
as interference in its domestic affairs. More seriously, the 
Chinese Government announced that it would not accept threats 
and is not really concerned if the United States continues 
granting it MFN status if Clinton's administration links this 
status with the right to interfere in matters that do not 
concern it. 
  Clinton could not pick up the gauntlet thrown down by China. 
More strangely, the U.S. President felt compelled to announce 
that it was in the interest of the American people to seek 
rapprochement between the two countries. And so... realism 
overcame principle and economic ties between Washington and 
Beijing grew closer in a way that astonished everyone who 
expected them to deteriorate because China insisted on clinging 
to its own method of ruling more than 1.5 billion people. 
  Last year U.S. exports to China amounted to nearly $8 
billion. This was necessary to provide jobs for approximately 
150,000 people who would otherwise have been unemployed, 
particularly in California and Florida, two states of great 
importance in U.S. presidential elections. 
  To be fair one must point out that many men and women in the 
U.S. administration were shocked by the triumph of money over 
principle, including adviser Anthony Lake and the U.S. 
representative at the United Nations Madeleine Albright. They 
declared their rejection of any economic cooperation with China 
unless its government showed respect for human rights. These 
objections, however, were soon dissipated before the slogan 
(U.S. interests first) raised by Commerce Secretary Ron Brown 
and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. The immense Chinese market 
is capable of enriching any industrial country and, according to 
the commerce and treasury secretaries, it would not be fair to 
the U.S. people to lose this market to the European nations or 
Japan. 
  The desire to secure the Chinese market for the United 
States was not the only reason that President Clinton was 
persuaded to ignore the issue of the lack of human rights in 
China. There was the additional worry about North Korea's 
reported nuclear capability which might threaten that region's 
security and stability. The U.S. administration believes that 
only China can persuade North Korea to accept what the free 
world wants from it. 
  This confidence in China's abilities carries a high price 
for 
Clinton. Beijing's government does not object to calming down 
North Korea on condition that all talk about events inside China 
and all accusations that it violates human rights end. This has 
actually happened, represented by the flow of U.S. investments 
to this most favored country. 
  I am not exaggerating when I point out the similarity--with 
some differences--between respect for human rights U.S.-style 
and the same slogans raised by many human rights organizations 
that are established every day in various parts of the world. 
  We have heard of a human rights organization established by 
several people who all their lives have been known as inveterate 
enemies of humanity! Not long ago they had high government 
posts and no one can forget how they used to suppress liberties, 
torture the citizens, and humiliate the innocent while raising 
the brazen slogan: Freedom is for the people but there is no 
freedom for the people's enemies. 
  The term "people" in the slogan referred to those who 
supported and defended the dictatorship and the "people's 
enemies" were millions of wretched citizens who opposed 
oppression, injustice, and tyranny and as a result were deprived 
of their rights and liberties. It is laughable to the point of 
making us want to weep that the individuals who raised this 
slogan that divided the public into freemen and slaves are the 
same ones who have now renounced the slogan and have become, 
after losing their power and influence, defenders of liberty and 
martyrs of human rights. 
  We have likewise heard about the establishment of another 
human rights society which is not perturbed by the terrorist 
acts of the past few years, designed to undermine Egypt's 
security and stability, in which dozens of children, women, old 
men, and police officers died. To this society it would appear 
that those who died in these terrorist acts had no rights that 
must be defended. More appallingly, this same society raises an 
outcry whenever it hears that a terrorist has been seized while 
committing a crime against the entire Egyptian people. It 
issues statements, holds meetings, makes threats and accuses our 
government of violating human rights. It asserts--as if it were 
an eyewitness--that the arrested terrorist was whipped, tortured 
with fire, and subjected to electric shocks to extract untrue 
confessions from him! 
  How astonishing is this distinction between the rights of a 
terrorist and the rights of an entire nation. The society in 
question believes that the terrorist must be defended and 
exonerated regardless of his crime and evidence proving his 
guilt and regardless of the innocence of the police of the 
charge of torturing him. At the same time, this society 
believes that the nation has no right to ask for protection from 
the terrorists' grenades, the murderers' assaults, their knife 
attacks, their metal chains, and nail-filled bombs. The members 
of the society for the defense of the rights of criminal 
terrorists believe that because the people do not want to 
entrust their future to the princes of terror, the propagators 
of religious ignorance, and professional criminals, they 
therefore deserve what is happening to them.

  [Text] Mr. Mas'ud Barzani has issued a press statement 
clarifying the ambiguities in his recent statements calling for 
placing Iraqi Kurdistan under UN trusteeship, or making it a 
protectorate under the canopy of international peacekeeping 
forces. The following is the text of the press statement: 
  On 6 June 1994, the BBC, British papers, and AFP carried my 
statement in which I call for placing Iraqi Kurdistan under UN 
trusteeship or making it a protectorate under the canopy of 
international peacekeeping forces. It is important for us to 
explain the following to the Iraqi people, the national 
opposition forces, and the governments involved: 
  1. The statement was interpreted by some people as a call to 
partition and divide Iraq. We deny this in part and parcel. 
The statement came as an attempt to find a description for the 
anomalous situation of Iraqi Kurdistan. Though the Western 
countries alliance provide protection and there is a local 
Kurdish administration, this administration suffers from the 
weak support of the foreign humanitarian organizations operating 
in the region and from the countries which are offering 
humanitarian aid, and also from the weak cooperation between it 
and these organizations and countries. This makes it less 
capable of tackling economic and security issues. 
  2. We are grateful for and highly value the protection the 
alliance countries afford through Provide Comfort and the 
efforts that UN agencies and foreign nongovernmental 
organizations exert. Had it not been for this protection and 
assistance, another humanitarian tragedy would have befallen the 
besieged and isolated Kurdish people. 
  3. Thanks to the peace efforts that were exerted by all good 
people, particularly the practical steps made by the Unified 
Iraqi National Congress [UINC] center of operations, the Kurdish 
crisis was contained by the Kurdish leadership itself and the 
help of the UINC, and the cease-fire was entrenched. The 
process of normalizing the state of affairs continues. The 
dialogue and reconciliation between the Democratic Party of 
Kurdistan, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, and the other 
parties are in full swing to achieve comprehensive peace and to 
seek practical formulas for joint cooperation between the two 
sides in the future. 
  4. We support Iraq's unity, and our policy is constant in 
this respect and has not changed. We also carry out activities 
as part of the Iraqi opposition, represented by the UINC, and 
abide by its program and objectives of establishing a democratic 
and multiparty replacement that would achieve federalism within 
the framework of a unified Iraq. We firmly believe that the 
Kurdish problem should be solved within the context of the 
broader Iraqi problem. 
  To avoid any ambiguities and obscurity we deemed it 
necessary 
to issue this press statement. 
  Signed: Mas'ud Barzani, 9 June 1994

  [Text] Baghdad, 13 Jun (INA)--The newspaper AL-THAWRAH has 
said that the Saudi regime's role in the Yemeni crisis is much 
larger and more serious than mere involvement because it is a 
flagrant and exposed conspiratorial role. This role is not 
confined to supplying the renegade secessionists with arms, but 
also provides political support for the secessionists, 
interferes in Yemen's internal affairs, and exploits the crisis 
to annex new Yemeni territory. 
  In an article today, the paper, speaking for the Arab 
Socialist Ba'th Party, says that any political observer with 
minimum awareness of the nature of the reactionary Saudi regime 
and its policies, connections, and position on Arab unity in 
general and Yemeni unity in particular will never be surprised 
by the statements of 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, Yemeni minister of 
planning and development, about Saudi Arabia, which is now a 
party supporting the secessionists and supplying them with 
unlimited quantities of arms purchased from East European states. 
  AL-THAWRAH adds that the Saudi regime has begun to reveal 
its 
conspiratorial role in the Yemeni crisis, and is now acting 
openly, contrary to what it did when the crisis first erupted 
when it falsely proclaimed concern for Yemeni unity. The paper 
notes that the false allegations made by the renegades that this 
or that Arab state is taking part in the war alongside the 
forces of legitimacy were merely a desperate and exposed attempt 
to cover the fact that the Saudi regime supplied them with arms 
and military hardware, especially after the forces of legitimacy 
seized 80 tanks sent from the Saudis to the secessionists. 
  AL-THAWRAH points to the Saudi forces' buildup on the Yemeni 
border and to the military city which the agent henchman Fahd 
ordered to be quickly built on the Yemeni border. This clearly 
exposes the Saudi regime's insistence on playing its 
non-pan-Arab and unethical role against the fraternal Yemeni 
people. 
  Concluding its article, the paper says: Regardless of their 
conspiracy and treasonous conduct against the Arab nation, the 
rulers of Saudi Arabia cannot halt the movement of history and 
will not succeed in perpetuating their corrupt and worn-out 
regime.

  [Text] Taha Yasin Ramadan, Revolution Command Council 
member and vice president, has called for spreading health 
awareness among citizens and enhancing ways to prevent disease 
through domestic educational programs and popular seminars in 
the cities and villages of our great Iraq in order to prevent 
illnesses before treating them. 
  During a meeting with the head and members of the Iraqi Red 
Crescent Society, Ramadan described the suffering of the sons of 
our people, particularly the children and elderly, due to the 
blockade and resulting shortage of medicines as the crime of the 
age, a violation of human rights, and an encroachment on divine 
values and international charters. 
  The vice president added that the continued food and 
medicine 
blockade on the Iraqi people has exposed both the enemies of 
mankind and those who are using the defense of human rights, 
peoples' freedom, and peoples' prosperity, as a disguise. He 
noted the importance of moves by charitable and humanitarian 
organizations to reject the U.S.-led hostile policy which is 
implemented by the U.S. allies who are fighting the Iraqi people 
using food and medicines after they failed to harm them through 
a wide military aggression. 
  Dr. Sa'dun Khalifah, head of the Society, reviewed its 
efforts to alleviate the illnesses which the children and 
elderly are suffering as a result of the continued blockade.

<F P=106> ["Above the Red Line" column by Fawzi Ibrahim: "Medicine </F>
Trade Too!"] 
  [Text] It seems that the cancer of soaring prices is not 
confined to basic commodities and other materials but acutely 
and clearly affects the medicine trade, although the state 
provides medical necessities and medicines for the citizens by 
importing and marketing them. A specialized institution is 
carrying out that duty and is distributing these necessities and 
medicines to pharmacies and other marketing centers. A new 
group of people, however, has entered the trade markets along 
with traders, brokers, and parasites on this profession, which 
are using various ways to torture the sons of their people and 
to suck their blood in order to make huge profits and to become 
wealthy at the expense of millions of poor, patient people. 
God, conscience, and history will punish this group of people 
for standing in the ranks of Iraq's enemies, which want to hurt 
the patient people. 
  Regrettably, the pharmacies have been drifted by this 
current 
and have imposed high prices on pharmaceutical materials and 
necessities and medicines, although the Medicine Corporation has 
fixed the prices of these materials. Woe unto you if you ask 
the pharmacist any question. He may refuse to give you the 
medicine which you badly need even if you pay him a fortune. 
This is not how the elite treat each other. They do not forget 
their patriotism to make profits at the expense of the sick and 
the poor of our people. Some pharmacies even sell medicines and 
antibiotics to hospitals or private clinics, instead of 
displaying them, so that they can avoid questioning. At the 
same time, these hospitals ask for fantastic prices. In this 
way, pharmacists avoid embarrassment before the citizens. The 
majority of the pharmacies also exploit weak control, 
inspection, and follow up by the competent authorities to invent 
ways to sell these medicines as imported materials. Although 
these pharmacies were charged by the competent authorities with 
violating the fixed prices, they resumed their violations 
following the end of their closure periods. The pharmacists 
union should take a firm position toward these violators by 
withdrawing their licenses, the Medicine Corporation should 
cancel agency contracts with them, and the security, party, and 
popular institutions are urged to follow up and deal with this 
phenomenon like other phenomena which have recently surfaced, 
especially the phenomenon of the surging prices of basic 
commodities.

  [Text] Baghdad, June 13, INA--Some 4,574 Iraqi people have 
reported dead over the past month of April because of the 
negative consequences of the ongoing economic sanctions. 
[sentence as received] 
  A recent report by the Ministry of Health has showed an 
alarming rise in mortality rate among Iraqi people, and in 
particular among children over the past month of April (three 
and a half years after the imposition of the embargo) in 
camparison with mortality rate recorded during the same period 
in 1989 (a year before the imposition of the embargo). 
  The report blamed the rise in mortality rate to the dearth 
of 
food and medicine because of the UN-imposed trade sanctions on 
Iraq. 
  As usual, children are hit hardest by the sanctions. 
According to the report some 3,119 children under the age of 
five perished because of diarrhea, pneumonia and malnutrition 
related diseases in comparison with some 347 children died over 
the same period in 1989. 
  The Ministry's report attributed the rise in fatalities 
among 
children to acute shortages of food and medicine because of the 
trade sanctions and shortages of clean potable water and 
breakdown of a number of water-treatment plants in some parts of 
the country due to the bombing by U.S.-allies aircraft during 
the war and lack of spare parts for maintenance and repair work. 
  The Ministry's report noted that during April, 1989, a year 
before the imposition of the sanctions, the number of children 
struck by malnutrition related diseases was 71, whereas the 
number of children fatalities over the same period 1994 reached 
some 1,146 scoring an almost a 1,514 per cent increase. 
  Moreover, the report showed that diarrhea has claimed the 
lives of 122 children under the age of five over the month of 
April 1989 in comparison with some 940 deaths recorded during 
the same period in 1994, that is some 670.5 per cent increase. 
  Likewise, the number of children fatalities because of 
penumonia during April 1994 recorded a sharp increase of 570.8 
per cent, the report pointed out, indicating that the number of 
deaths registered during April 1989 was 154 in comparison with 
some 1,033 deaths for the same period in 1994. 
  As for patients who suffer from chronic disease, the report 
noted that hypertension, diabetes and malignant neoplasms were 
the main causes of the death of 1,455 compared with some 454 
deaths registered over the same period in 1989. 
  According to the Ministry's report, some 105 people died 
because of hypertension over the month of April, 1989 in 
comparison with 401 who died over the same period in 1994, 
recording an increase of 281.9 per cent over 1989's figure. 
  In the meantime, fatalities caused by diabetes have 
registered a sharp rise in April 1994, said the report, noting 
that some 272 people have died over the month of April 1994 
compared with some 92 ones for the same period in 1989, scoring 
an increase of 195.65 per cent over 1989's figure. 
  According to the report, some 783 people who suffer from 
malignant neoplames have died during April 1994 compared with 
some 257 ones died over the same period in 1989. 
  The cause of the sharp rise in deaths among patients who 
suffer from cancer is blamed on the inadequate radio therapy 
received by the patients as a result of dearth of medicine 
caused by the embargo. 
  According to an earlier report by the nuclear and 
radioactive 
therapy hospital, the hospital's departments face sharp 
shortages of chemical and hormone medicines. 
  The absence of cobalt radioactive element needed for the 
treatment of malignant tumours has hit plans to care for people 
in bad need for radio therapy.

  [Excerpt] Kuwait, 13 Jun -- Canadian Defense Minister David 
Collenette said today that in his talks with Kuwaiti officials 
he had discussed the possibility of strengthening relations 
between the two countries in defense matters. 
  Speaking at a news conference at the end of his two-day 
visit 
to Kuwait, he said: "We hope to work together on defense 
matters and that some of our companies will carry out commercial 
operations with the Kuwaiti Government." He added: "We 
particularly hope that the Western Star truck model will receive 
every interest from the Kuwaiti Army and National Guard." 
  He indicated that the truck deal is at "a very advanced 
stage." The Kuwait Oil Company purchased 63 trucks of this type 
in 1991. 
  Collenette described his meetings with Kuwaiti officials as 
cordial, and said that the visits of Canadian officials to 
Kuwait "express our concern with the stability of Kuwait and the 
region as well as Kuwait's future safety." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Sami Kulayb in Paris] </F>
  [Excerpts] 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, member of the 
Yemeni Presidential Council and assistant secretary general of 
the General People's Congress, has placed much of the blame for 
the current fighting in Yemen on the Arabian Gulf states, 
particularly Saudi Arabia. Their support for the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP], he believes, is aimed at taking the issue 
to the Security Council for it to acknowledge the secession. 
  In a statement to AL-SAFIR at his place of residence in 
Paris, where he seeks meetings with French officials, 
'Abd-al-Ghani stressed that what is taking place in Yemen now 
"was not born on the spur of moment, but is the natural result 
of several steps made by the YSP, especially during and after 
the signing of the Pledge and Accord document in Amman." 
[passage omitted] 
  Asked why the YSP is blamed for the war, 'Abd-al-Ghani said: 
"Since the signing of the Pledge and Accord document in Jordan, 
'Ali Salim al-Bid has been preparing for secession. He ordered 
that the northern al-'Amaliqah Brigade be besieged, and he 
wanted to travel to Saudi Arabia immediately after the signing 
to say that the military situation dictated secession. But the 
Army's Signal Corps, which was united, discovered the scheme, 
and the Jordanian hospitality forced al-Bid to stay in Amman 
longer than he expected. [no closing quotation marks as 
published] 
  Asked whether al-Bid and Saudi Arabia had agreed in advance 
about the secession, the northern official answered: "Al-Bid 
himself said that in an interview to a Gulf newspaper. Indeed, 
he later blamed his brothers in the Gulf because they had 
abandoned him. All this indicates that Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, 
and the United Arab Emirates have something to do, near or far, 
with what is taking place." 
  He added: "Perhaps no one likes to see his neighbor stronger 
than himself. Perhaps the discovery of oil helped strengthen 
the feelings of anxiety in the neighboring countries, which 
still attach great importance to the land. We suspect that some 
countries are working to divide Yemen, not only into two parts, 
but into many regions." 
  He said: "Calls by the Gulf countries to impose a cease-fire 
on the Yemeni Government are aimed at portraying the government 
as objector to a cease-fire. This would help bring the issue to 
the Security Council, and perhaps lead the latter to recognize 
the status quo and to the provision of direct and public support 
for the southerners." [passage omitted] 
  Concerning other foreign interventions affecting 
developments 
in Yemen, 'Abd-al-Ghani suggested that the Egyptian position is 
vague and directly linked to the Saudi position. He said the 
claim that Iraq is supporting the north contains much 
fabrication and falsehood. "How can one believe al-Bid's claim 
that Baghdad sent us warplanes when no Iraqi Air Force plane can 
take off without the permission of the international forces?" he 
asked. 
  'Abd-al-Ghani also noted the negative Russian position, 
reflected by the absence of the Russian ambassador from 
'Abd-al-Ghani's meeting with the ambassadors of the Security 
Council permanent member states. This position, 'Abd-al-Ghani 
said, proceeds from Russia's economic interests in the Gulf 
states. As regard to the United States and Britain "they have 
no interest in breaking up Yemen unless interests are given 
precedence over principles and stability of nations." 
  He denied that the current situation has isolated the Yemeni 
president. He said: "Our contacts with the Gulf states and 
other countries have continued, and we are intensifying 
initiatives to stop the bloodshed among the sons of the 
homeland." He added: "Let us assume that we made a mistake in 
the past. We apologized, but we cannot continue to endlessly 
pay a price." 
  'Abd-al-Ghani ruled out the involvement of the Islamic 
trends 
or tribes in the situation. He explained: "Al-Bid tried to 
suggest that Islamic trends are influencing the decisions of the 
president and that Yemen will turn into an Islamic country like 
Sudan, but the facts disprove this, just as they prove that the 
legitimate army is alone in the battlefield. We are avoiding 
bringing the tribes into the conflict or arming the people 
because we are not engaged in a civil war." 
  The northern official stressed that the oil wells are far 
from the centers of the struggle "and that Washington asked for 
them to be neutralized."

<F P=106> [Interview with 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri, deputy chairman of </F>
South Yemen Presidential Council, by Lutfi Shatarah; place and 
date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Shatarah] Sanaa stresses 
that Aden is seeking by all means to internationalize the Yemeni 
situation. 
  [Al-Jifri] The issue has been internationalized by 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih twice: once when he signed a document on the 
formation of a joint military committee which included brothers 
in Oman and Jordan and French and U.S. friends. 
  He thereby wanted to embarrass (President) 'Ali Salim al-Bid 
and portray him as the one who was rejecting the solutions, so 
al-Bid had to sign. He internationalized the issue for the 
second time when he launched military aggression against all the 
southern territory and not against the Socialist Party as he 
claims. [passage omitted] 
  [Shatarah] Are you satisfied with the Arab and international 
positions on the war in Yemen? 
  [Al-Jifri] Most of our Arab brothers and friends have 
adopted cordial stands which we will never forget. We thank 
them for these stands, which our people appreciate. 
  [Shatarah] And the U.S. position? 
  [Al-Jifri] It too is a serious position which demonstrates 
understanding of the issue. 
  [Shatarah] There are reports that the north is implementing 
a plan aimed at separating Hadhramaut from the south, setting up 
a Hadhrami state, and then merging the other southern 
governorates with the north? 
  [Al-Jifri] That has not run, nor will it run, through the 
mind of anyone in the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY]. If 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's aim is to achieve that through the 
aggressive war he has launched, he will not achieve it. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Shatarah] Do you believe that the delay in recognizing the 
DRY has contributed to the escalation of the fighting? 
  [Al-Jifri] World states are dealing with us -- which is a 
tacit recognition. As for official recognition, without doubt 
it is on the way. Because we have a cause and rights. And 
because our people have maintained a heroic steadfastness 
unprecedented in our contemporary history. They have made great 
sacrifices for the sake of the DRY. World states cannot ignore 
something like that. 
  [Shatarah] 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih says that he will not hold a 
dialogue with the Socialist Party leadership but, instead, with 
the moderates and the unionists, in the sense that he rules out 
dialogue with you as a new leadership in the south. 
  [Al-Jifri] And who said that he is the absolute master in 
this world and thus can exclude whomever he wants and accept 
whomever he wants? Let him say what he wants. [passage omitted] 
  [Shatarah] What measures will you take in the event of the 
failure of the cease-fire attempts and the international envoy's 
mission? 
  [Al-Jifri] 'Ali 'Abdallah announced (for the media) his 
agreement to implement the Security Council resolutions in 
letter and spirit. But -- as usual -- he failed to fulfill 
that. And we have no other option than to stand fast, resist, 
and prevent him from entering, seizing, and toppling the DRY 
(Aden). However, we will comply fully with the cease-fire. And 
we will use our right to defend ourselves, the land, and out 
honor. 
  And the only solution to this matter is the dispatch of 
international observers to supervise the cease-fire. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Shatarah] What truth is there in the reports of Jordan's 
involvement in sending military engineers to work with northern 
forces? 
  [Al-Jifri] I have no details about that matter, and it was 
not expected of the brothers in Jordan. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The gang of apostasy and secession in the [Yemeni] 
Socialist Party [YSP] leadership has prevented a food convoy 
from entering Aden. Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council and supreme 
commander of the Armed Forces, instructed the Government to 
prepare this convoy within 24 hours, send it to Aden, and 
distribute it free of charge among the residents of Aden, the 
economic and commercial capital. 
  Deputy Prime Minister brother Dr. 'Abd-al-Qadir Ba Jammal 
explained that in implementation of the instructions of the 
brother chairman leader, the Government prepared a convoy of 100 
trailers carrying large quantities of various foodstuffs. 
  In a news conference attended by correspondents from the 
local, Arab, and international media in Sanaa, the brother 
deputy prime minister denied the allegations and falsehoods 
circulated by the trumpets of the gang of apostasy and secession 
to the effect that the aircraft of the forces of unity and 
constitutional legitimacy are launching raids on the Aden 
refinery. He said the forces of unity and constitutional forces 
are careful not to harm this refinery or other vital economic 
installations.

  [Text] A new three-hour cease-fire initiative was announced 
by Sanaa at dawn today. Sanaa announced the initiative at the 
request of Yemeni Deputy Prime Minister Brigadier General 
Mujahid Abu-Shawarib who is in Paris. This came in an official 
statement distributed to the press in Sanaa at dawn today. The 
statement says that the Yemeni Socialist Party leaders submitted 
this request to Brig. Gen. Abu-Shawarib, who referred the 
request to the command in Sanaa, which gave its approval. The 
cease-fire is for only three hours from 0600 local time [0300 
GMT]. 
  The statement adds that if the southerners do not abide by 
the cease-fire during the specified period, the northern forces 
will resume their military operations. 
  Brig. Gen. Mujahid Abu-Shawarib is playing the role of 
mediator between the two warring parties in Yemen to have them 
hold a dialogue.

  [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 13 (AFP) -- A ceasefire declared 
by the Yemen government failed to take hold on Monday as 
shelling resumed after a brief pause in bombardments that killed 
six more civilians and wounded 28, an AFP correspondent reported. 
  The government in Sanaa had announced a new three-hour 
ceasefire to start at 6.00 a.m. (0300 GMT), but after a brief 
lull the sound of artillery fire could be heard at the very 
moment the truce should have started. 
  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih had ordered the ceasefire "to 
test how the other party will respect the new ceasefire 
initiative and to give them a chance," an official statement in 
Sanaa said. 
  Hospital officials in this southern port city said that six 
civilians had been killed and 28 wounded in overnight shelling 
by Salih's northern forces which damaged five houses in 
Al-Mansurah, a suburb of Aden. 
  Twenty-two wounded southern troops loyal to Salih's rival 
'Ali Salim al-Bid were taken to the Al-Jumhuriyah hospital here 
on Sunday, officials said. 
  The Sanaa government said the ceasefire -- the fourth 
announced since June 6 -- had been requested by the "Yemen 
Socialist Party rebels," a reference to al-Bid and his followers. 
  It said the request came via Mujahid Abu-Shawarib, who has 
been acting as a mediator between the government and certain YSP 
officials. 
  "The Yemen government agreed to this request and President 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih gave his order to all military leaders to 
cease fire," it said. 
  "This period is to test how the other party will respect the 
new ceasefire initiative and to give them a chance. 
  "If they don't respect the ceasefire in this period, the 
Yemen government will continue fighting," the statement said. 
  On Sunday the Yemeni government announced a five-day period 
for dialogue to end a civil war raging between northern and 
southern forces in Yemen since May 5. 
  A previous ceasefire announced by Sanaa late Friday broke 
down when fighting resumed early Saturday. 
  Both sides blame each other for the failure of the 
ceasefires.

  [Text] The gang of apostasy and secession in the [Yemeni] 
Socialist Party [YSP] leadership has prevented a food convoy 
from entering Aden. Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council and supreme 
commander of the Armed Forces, instructed the Government to 
prepare this convoy within 24 hours, send it to Aden, and 
distribute it free of charge among the residents of Aden, the 
economic and commercial capital. 
  Deputy Prime Minister brother Dr. 'Abd-al-Qadir Ba Jammal 
explained that in implementation of the instructions of the 
brother chairman leader, the Government prepared a convoy of 100 
trailers, 40 carrying wheat, 30 carrying rice, 21 carrying 
various products including peas, broad beans, vegetable oil, 
ghee, and tomato paste, and nine trailers carrying various kinds 
of vegetables. 
  Ba Jammal said that the Government informed the 
International 
Red Cross that it is preparing this food convoy as part of a 
plan for the free distribution of these products among the Aden 
residents in accordance with the UN plans and programs. 
  At a news conference he held in Sanaa yesterday afternoon, 
Ba 
Jammal said that the Government yesterday received a message 
from the Red Crescent and the Red Cross through their regional 
representatives in the Arabian Peninsula stating they had met 
with other officials and that the matter needs the approval of 
the other party, which, unfortunately, views this humanitarian 
gesture as a political action. He said that this is the story 
behind the obstruction of our humanitarian initiative by those 
who remained outside the homeland for 25 years and now returned 
to speak on behalf of its sons and prevent this assistance from 
reaching the sons of heroic Aden. 
  At the news conference attended by correspondents from the 
local, Arab, and international media in Sanaa, the brother 
deputy prime minister denied the allegations and falsehoods 
circulated by the trumpets of the gang of apostasy and secession 
to the effect that the aircraft of the forces of unity and 
constitutional legitimacy are launching raids on the Aden 
refinery. He said the forces of unity and constitutional 
legitimacy are careful not to harm this refinery or other vital 
economic installations. 
  Brother Ba Jammal said that contacts continue with the 
unionist leaders in the YSP, both in and outside Yemen. He 
explained that these contacts take place through national 
figures from other groupings. 
  The deputy prime minister, replying to questions posed by 
the 
media correspondents, tackled the national issues pertaining to 
the current developments in the Yemeni arena.

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council, today received the 
ambassadors of the permanent member states of the UN Security 
Council and discussed with them the latest developments in our 
country in light of the secessionist rebel gang's continuing 
violations of the cease-fire decision and its refusal to comply 
with Security Council Resolution No. 924. He referred to the 
numerous opportunities provided for that criminal gang to cease 
fire and end the shedding of Yemeni blood. The latest of these 
opportunities, he said, was the one provided for the fifth time 
to that gang this morning. Yet, he added, the gang continues 
its violations and its aggression against our Armed Forces, 
which observed the cease-fire decision and complied with the 
Security Council's resolution. 
  The brother president explained that by repeatedly violating 
the cease-fire, that gang is trying to bring in international 
observers and to internationalize the Yemeni crisis, pointing 
out that some states hostile to Yemen's unity are flagrantly 
interfering in Yemen's domestic affairs and encouraging the 
secessionist rebels to prolong the current conflict, in the 
implementation of plans to disrupt Yemeni unity. He said our 
Yemeni people absolutely reject any interference in their 
internal affairs and will firmly confront it, as well as all 
plans hostile to their unity and their democratic course. 
  President Salih then expressed his confidence that the 
permanent member states of the UN Security Council will take a 
firm and clear position toward these acts of interference in 
Yemen's domestic affairs, based on their support for Yemen's 
unity and its democratic pluralism. He said unity and democracy 
are the basis for stability in Yemen, stressing that they will 
never be relinquished because they are the true basis for a new 
Yemen--a basis which will realize the aspirations of our Yemeni 
people and which is in harmony with the trends of the new world 
order. 
  He reaffirmed our country's commitment to Security Council 
Resolution No. 924, as well as its decision to provide every 
possible support to make the fact-finding mission of brother 
Lakhdar Brahimi, envoy of the UN secretary general, successful. 
  For their part, the ambassadors reaffirmed their countries' 
support for unity and democracy in our country, as well as their 
readiness to support every effort for a cease-fire and to 
implement the Security Council's resolution regarding the 
Republic of Yemen. The meeting was attended by brother Yahya 
Husayn al-'Arashi, minister of civil service and administrative 
reform. 
  Today, as well, the brother chairman of the Presidential 
Council received the ambassadors of the Arab Maghreb Union 
member states to our country and discussed with them issues 
pertaining to relations between our country and the Arab Maghreb 
Union member states. They also reviewed developments in our 
country in light of the secessionist rebel gang's criminal acts 
against the homeland and the people, after it triggered war and 
infighting among the sons of the one Yemeni homeland. 
  The brother president explained to the brother ambassadors 
that the secessionist rebel gang is continuing to violate the 
cease-fire decision. It is flagrantly challenging the national 
consensus and international will, although that criminal gang 
has been given many chances to end the bloodshed in Yemen. But, 
he said, it continues its aggression on our country while it 
invites other parties' hostility to Yemen in order to enable the 
enemies of the homeland to interfere in Yemen's internal affairs 
as part of a secessionist, criminal plan to disrupt the Yemeni 
homeland. 
  The brother president then expressed his appreciation of the 
principled, firm pan-Arab positions of the Arab Maghreb Union 
member states and their support for their brothers in Yemen and 
for the march of Yemen's unity and democracy, which constitute a 
basis for stability in Yemen and the region and which will 
entrench higher pan-Arab goals. He expressed his confidence 
that these positions will continue for the benefit of Yemen and 
the Arab nation. 
  The meeting was attended by Yahya Husayn al-'Arashi, 
minister 
of civil service and administrative reform.

AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT Shabwah Governor Says: I Invite Lakhdar 
Brahimi To Ascertain Our Victories. I Am Finding Difficulty in 
Compelling Tribes To Stop Fighting"] 
  [Excerpts] London -- Shabwah Governor Ahmad Farid 
al-Suraymah has said: "I am complying with the cease-fire and 
Security Council Resolution 924 in my capacity as governor and 
military governor of Shabwah Governorate. However, I am finding 
difficulty in controlling the Shabwah tribes and compelling them 
to comply with this resolution since they have begun to pursue 
the northerners." 
  He said this over the telephone from his command post in 
'Armah (one of the directorates in Shabwah Governorate). The 
governor promised to exert his efforts to achieve discipline 
among the tribes. But he said: "It is a difficult task. It is 
a popular resistance, and I advise Brother President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih to withdraw the remnants of his forces from 
Shabwah, otherwise I will not be responsible." 
  The Shabwah governor stressed that he is now at the 
approaches of 'Ataq, capital of the governorate. And that the 
distance between him and it does not exceed 20 km. He added 
that his forces have recaptured most of the governorate's 
territory, except some five square km in the city of 'Ataq 
itself. And that he has achieved total control for the southern 
authorities over the cities of Nisab, al-Musayni'ah, and 'Armah. 
[passage omitted] 
  The Shabwah governor said that he had invited Lakhdar 
Brahimi, envoy of the UN secretary general, to visit the 
governorate "in order to ascertain that we are in control of 
more than 90 percent of its territory. We are awaiting him." 
He added that this "refutes (President) 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's 
allegation that Shabwah is under his control." [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] A responsible source at the Ministry of Defense 
of the Democratic Republic of Yemen has said that the forces of 
the ruling military regime in Sanaa continued today their 
desperate attacking attempts on all the battlefronts. They 
launched random rocket and artillery attacks on residential 
quarters and peaceful villages in expression of the regime's 
hysterical state and inability to achieve any progress on all 
the battlefronts. 
  In a statement to the ADEN NEWS AGENCY, the source pointed 
out that the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Yemen 
faced with legendary courage these desperate attempted 
offensives. They inflicted crushing blows on the invading 
forces resulting in heavy losses. The source pointed out that 
eight hostile tanks, three armored cars and two Katyusha rocket 
vehicles were destroyed. The northern troops also suffered 
hundreds of dead and wounded. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Tawfiq Jazulit in al-Mukalla, south Yemen -- </F>
italicized passages recorded] 
  [Text] [Jazulit] The residents of Aden today appealed to UN 
envoy Lakhdar Brahimi to visit their city and learn about their 
worsening conditions as a result of the war, but he apologized 
for security reasons. 
  [Brahimi] It is difficult for me to go for one reason: 
Namely, the security situation is unstable. The United Nations 
is evacuating people from there. I know that there is a shortage 
of medicine in the hospitals, but it is not possible for a UN 
plane or for the UN envoy to go there while the cease-fire is 
not holding. A Red Cross ship has been waiting for several 
days, begging in vain for permission to dock and unload food. 
These people have been my friends for 30 years; they are 
neutral. But there is one point on which we are not neutral: 
The need for a cease-fire. 
  [Jazulit] Before leaving al-Mukalla, Brahimi met with 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid, president of the new state in south Yemen. 
Because the southerners stick to their position, the meeting 
produced no positive results regarding an end to the war. 
  [Al-Bid] I believe brother Lakhdar Brahimi has learned 
about the situation. He has repeatedly said, even before he 
arrived here, that priority should be given to a cease-fire. I 
think he is right. We have to do everything to achieve this 
objective now. 
  [Jazulit] Brahimi expressed the identical position to that 
of 
the southern political leadership concerning a cease-fire. 
  [Brahimi] My conclusion is what he [al-Bid] has just 
said, that the brothers here support a cease-fire and the 
beginning of the dialogue. 
  [Jazulit] Brahimi left al-Mukalla without convincing the 
southern political leadership of a federation or a confederation 
as a compromise solution. He also apologized to the people of 
Aden for not being able to visit them for security reasons. The 
southerners attach hope to a decisive Security Council decision. 
Otherwise, the war of attrition may drag for long. The war 
goes on.

  [Text] UN Envoy Lakhdar Brahimi has informed the Sanaa 
government of the southern leaders' conditions and demands for 
beginning negotiations on the Yemeni dispute. 
  A ranking northern Yemeni official told AFP that Lakhdar 
Brahimi contacted the leaders in Sanaa and communicated to them 
a list of questions and points pertaining to the guarantees the 
southerners want fulfilled to initiate negotiations with Sanaa. 
  The official added that the working group, chaired by 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and tasked with holding contacts 
with Aden, will meet today to discuss these questions. The 
northern official did not elaborate further on these questions. 
However, Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, the prime minister of the 
Democratic Republic of Yemen, unilaterally proclaimed by the 
southerners, said that Aden calls for an unconditional and 
immediate cease-fire, the deployment of international observers 
to supervise its implementation, and the return of the 
aggressors, as he called them, to the pre-22 May 1990 borders, 
the date unity was declared. 
  Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas said this following his meeting 
with UN Envoy Lakhdar Brahimi in al-Mukalla yesterday evening, 
who later met with southern leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid. Following 
the meeting, 'Ali Salim al-Bid said that he briefed Brahimi on 
the deteriorating situation in Yemen, reemphasizing that 
priority should be given to a cease-fire. 
  Lakhdar Brahimi, contrary to what the southern officials 
wanted, did not visit Aden. He said this is due to the security 
instability there. 
  Brahimi left al-Mukalla for Abu Dhabi where he arrived 
yesterday evening accompanied by Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas. The 
Emirates News Agency says that Brahimi's visit to Abu Dhabi is 
part of a tour of several Arab countries in the region.

  The Sanaa regime continues to violate UN Security Council 
Resolution No. 924 by its feverish aggression against the 
Democratic Republic of Yemen. It has been launching rockets 
since this morning against civilians and installations in the 
suburbs of Aden, the capital, in a hysterical and malicious 
manner. This led to the martyrdom of 10 persons, five of whom 
belonged to the same family. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abdallah Hammudah and Lutfi Shatarah: </F>
"Questions in Yemeni Streets About Benefit of Continuing War"] 
  [Excerpts] London, Sanaa, Aden, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, SPA -- 
International envoy Lakhdar Brahimi yesterday concluded his 
visit to Yemen and meetings with the parties to the war there 
without being able to visit Aden as a result of the northern 
bombardment of it. [passage omitted] 
  Brahimi ended his meetings with southern leaders with a 
lunch 
meeting yesterday in 'Ali Salim al-Bid's house. The meeting was 
attended by Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, prime minister 
of the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY]; Foreign Minister 
'Abdallah al-Asnaj; and Muhsin Bin-Farid, deputy prime minister 
and planning minister. 
  Muhsin Bin-Farid told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT over the telephone 
from al-Mukalla yesterday that Brahimi met the day before 
yesterday with representatives of the political parties and 
organizations and ulemas. He also met with al-'Attas and 
al-Asnaj, stressing that "his basic mission is to listen to the 
southern leadership's view in the framework of the fact-finding 
process." He was provided with a detailed memorandum on the 
southern position. 
  Bin-Farid added that the southern leaders told Brahimi "of 
the need to impose the will of international legitimacy on the 
party violating the cease-fire" in accordance with Security 
Council Resolution 924, which stipulates "an immediate halt to 
the fighting and sitting at the negotiating table." 
  Bin-Farid said that the continuation of the fighting in 
Yemen 
-- despite Brahimi's visit -- "represents an attempt by Sanaa to 
use the fighting as a means to seize more land in southern 
governorates, while continuing to announce cease-fire 
initiatives merely to deceive foreign public opinion and impose 
a fait accompli." He also called for "adopting more powerful 
resolutions to force it to halt the fighting." 
  The southern official said that DRY leaders raised during 
their meetings with Brahimi the need to dispatch international 
observers "to supervise and consolidate the cease-fire." He 
said that "there have to be a third party in order to ascertain 
the quarter violating the resolution." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz today explained 
Lebanon's official stance on the peace talks following press 
reports of U.S. intervention in this matter. Minister Buwayz 
has categorically denied that the United States or any other 
party has proposed to Lebanon that it hold separate or 
collective talks with Israel. He said so far we have not 
received any new U.S. offer to resume the talks. He stressed 
that U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Mark Hambley did not discuss 
this subject during his meetings with Lebanese officials. Nor 
did the U.S. Ambassdor hint, insinuate, or deliver a message on 
this subject. 
  Regarding the Palestinian Yusuf Sha'ban, who is accused of 
assassinating [Jordanian diplomat] Na'ib al-Ma'aytah, and 
Sha'ban's new confession that he was behind the bombing of the 
Pan American plane over Lockerbie, Minister Buwayz will leave it 
to the court to take measures regarding this subject. He noted 
that judicial proceedings will begin if this claim is true.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Nasrallah: Israeli Ultimatums Will </F>
Not Prevent Us From Retaliating at a Time of Our Own Choosing"] 
  [Text] Beirut, AL-HAYAH -- Hizballah's Secretary General 
Hasan Nasrallah yesterday declared that the "Israeli ultimatums 
and the U.S. support for them will not prevent us from carrying 
out the promised retaliation" at a time to be determined by the 
resistance. 
  Nasrallah's declaration was made at a commemoration ceremony 
for the victims of the Israeli raid on a Hizballah training 
center in 'Ayn Kawkab, east of Ba'labakk, held in Beirut's 
southern suburb and attended by Mohammad Kazem Khonsari, 
director of the Iranian Foreign Ministry's Middle East and North 
Africa Department scholar Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah; Hizballah 
deputies and officials; Iranian Ambassador Hamayon 'Alizadeh; 
Fathi al-Shaqaqi, secretary general of the "Islamic Jihad in 
Palestine" [IJP]; Milad al-Qarih, representing Defense Minister 
Muhsin Dallul; Staff Brigadier General Husayn Nasr al-Din, 
representing Army Commander Emile Lahhud; and other influential 
Palestinian and Lebanese figures. 
  Khonsari expressed "condolences and congratulations from the 
Iranian people and government to the Lebanese people and 
government." He criticized the U.S. policy "for covering up the 
Zionist enemy's violation of Lebanon's sovereignty." He 
commended "the cohesion of the Lebanese internal situation 
manifested in the profound official and popular support for the 
resistance and its right to resist the occupation." He added: 
"We are fully convinced that Israel and its masters do not want 
peace with the peoples and states of this region; they want full 
capitulation and submission to Zionist hegemony, to deny our 
Arab and Islamic peoples their will, identity, and history." 
  Dr. al-Shaqaqi criticized the "policy of capitulation" and 
negotiation with Israel "while the enemy continues to break all 
international traditions and laws, with a direct American 
cover-up, by committing all kinds of terrorism against the Arab 
nation." He criticized Yasir 'Arafat's policy and pledged to 
"sustain the resistance in Lebanon and Palestine." 
  The ceremony was concluded with a speech by Nasrallah, who 
listed the aims of the Israeli raid on Ba'labakk, the most 
important being "to strike at the resistance, create a situation 
of popular frustration and confusion in its relations with its 
people and kinfolk, isolate it, create an air of incitement and 
sedition between the resistance and the state, try to break the 
fateful bond between Lebanon and Syria, push official Lebanon 
into peripheral negotiations that would lead to a separate peace 
with Israel, and send a message to Syria in continuation of the 
American and Israeli pressures on its leadership to make 
concessions, abandon rights, and accept Israel's peace terms." 
  He pointed out, however, that "these aims have failed." He 
emphasized that "continuation of the resistance is a right," and 
he praised the solidarity between the resistance and the people. 
  He said that "all kinds of sedition are forbidden and 
prohibited and would be a great service to the enemy, who is 
lying in wait for all of us. The domestic peace is a red line 
and a great achievement which must be preserved." He denied 
that "we are about to call for any form of intrinsic security." 
He added: "We are not a security alternative to anyone." He 
expressed a wish for "security achievement" at the level of 
"exposing the Israeli groups within." He urged "confrontation 
of the Israeli infiltration of the Lebanese arena through agents 
and spies." He voiced appreciation for the "official support 
for the resistance," which, he said, should be "deepened and 
rooted." He also called for withdrawal from the negotiations. 
  He emphasized that Lebanese-Syrian relations "are 
deep-rooted 
and strategic. They are one of the main foundations of Lebanon's 
strength." He praised Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad's firmness 
and his ability to tackle this phase skillfully and to face 
pressures and tribulations. He also noted Iran's support for 
Syria. 
  After criticizing the U.S. policy, he said: "Dear friends, 
our people and kinfolk, and also the Americans carrying the 
threatening messages and the Israelis who have not, since the 
raid, stopped issuing ultimatums: These ultimatums and threats 
will not prevent us from carrying out the promised retaliation 
in the course of our continuing resistance and jihad and at a 
time of our own choosing, and let Israel do what it likes. What 
does it want to do? Destroy our homes, kill us, scorch our 
land, steal our water, and occupy our country? It is doing that 
every day, and we will not stop in the face of that threat." He 
concluded: "It wanted it an open war, but when has it not been 
open?" He reaffirmed "continuation of the jihad."

  [Text] The secondary school built by the Civilian Affairs 
Administration in the border zone was inaugurated in Rumaysh 
yesterday. The ceremony was attended by General Gabi Ashkenazi, 
Israeli commander of the liaison unit; Colonel Shlomo Hasun, 
Israeli head of the Civilian Affairs Administration; and 
Lieutenant Colonel 'Aql Hashimi, commander of the western 
brigade, who represented South Lebanese Army Commander [SLA] 
Staff Major General Antoine Lahd. 
  In a speech he delivered on the occasion, Lt. Col. Hashim 
said that the difficult road that we have taken is nearing its 
end, and we have great hope that we will reach a safe haven. 
The features of the road are becoming clear after the 
successive signing of agreements with the Palestinians and the 
Jordanians, and with the Syrians in the future. 
  Hashim extended thanks on behalf of Rumaysh residents to 
Israel and the Israeli army for their assistance to the border 
strip residents. 
  Liaison Unit Commander Gen. Ashkenazi affirmed that Israel 
is 
extending its hand for peace. He said: We will cooperate with 
whoever wants peace and will retaliate against whoever wants war 
and terrorism. Our arm is long, and we will choose the suitable 
time and place to strike. 
  Ashkenazi said he is confident that the day will come when 
peace will be established between Lebanon and Israel and the 
borders between the two countries will come down. Meanwhile, he 
said, we will continue to fulfill the tasks we have. We believe 
that if there is no peace between nations, there will be no 
peace between states, and if there is no mutual respect between 
nations, there will be no good relations between states. 
  Answering correspondents' questions, Ashkenazi said that 
Hizballah is trying to carry out terrorist operations against 
the border area. It has intentions to do so. We are ready for 
such confrontation. We have taken all the possibilities into 
consideration and made all the necessary preparations. We hope 
that Hizballah will understand that terrorism is not the right 
way, and if it does not understand, we will teach it the 
necessary lesson. We do not hide in villages and among civilians 
as Hizballah does. If Hizballah is seeking a confrontation, let 
it come to the battlefield. Ashkenazi stated that he has 
instructed the troops not to respond to the sources of fire if 
they come from inside villages and fields under cultivation so 
that the retaliation will not burn the crops that the farmers 
worked hard to cultivate. 
  Answering a question by our correspondent regarding the 
relative calm that has recently prevailed in the area, and 
whether it is the result of Hizballah's fear of Israel's 
retaliation or the talks that U.S. officials held in Lebanon and 
Syria, Ashkenazi said it is due to all these reasons. Hizballah 
is afraid of Israeli retaliation. It has recently received a 
very painful blow, and needs a long time to recover.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Washington Conveyed Israeli </F>
Ultimatum to Lebanon"] 
  [Text] Beirut, AL-HAYAH -- Official Lebanese sources have 
told AL-HAYAH that, some days ago, the United States conveyed to 
Lebanon an Israeli ultimatum that Israel would hit Lebanon hard 
if Hizballah retaliated to its bombing of Hizballah's bases and 
centers with suicide operations abroad or across the Lebanese 
borders. 
  The sources said that U.S. Ambassador in Beirut Mark Hambley 
conveyed that ultimatum to the senior Lebanese officials he met 
with in the past few days, pointing out that Israel's ultimatum 
was in reply to Hizballah leaders' declarations that they would 
retaliate to the Israeli raid on 'Ayn Kawkab camp near Ba'labakk 
last week with suicide operations inside [Israel] and abroad. 
The raid left 35-40 Hizballah members dead, of whom 27 have been 
named, and 70 others injured. 
  The ultimatum, as conveyed by the American side, was that no 
Hizballah position in Lebanon would be safe, and it held the 
Lebanese Government responsible. 
  The sources told AL-HAYAH that the ultimatum was repeated by 
Uri Lubrani, head of the Israeli delegation to the negotiations 
with Lebanon, in statements he made the day before yesterday 
threatening a relentless war if Lebanon continued to embrace 
Hizballah. Senior Lebanese officials said they feared a major 
Israeli operation in the coming days as a consequence of that 
ultimatum and Lubrani's warnings. They have been concerned, 
particularly as the Western states and the United States clearly 
opposed their desire to have the Security Council issue a 
statement condemning Israel's violation of Lebanese sovereignty 
when it launched these raids last week.

<F P=106> [Report by Walid Shuqayr: "Washington Presses for Lebanon's </F>
Return to the Negotiations Without Waiting for Syria"] 
  [Text] Beirut -- Lebanese official sources have confirmed 
to AL-HAYAH that the U.S. Administration has asked Lebanon to 
resume bilateral negotiations with Israel without waiting for 
Syria, to ensure that progress is made in the negotiations on 
the Lebanese track. 
  The Lebanese official sources told AL-HAYAH that the U.S. 
request was in fact a hint and that the Lebanese officials just 
listened to the U.S. requests and hints and only said that they 
were waiting for matters to become clearer on the other tracks 
and for the situation to calm down on the military front and for 
an end to the Israeli escalations. 
  Official sources also told AL-HAYAH that the U.S. reaction 
to 
that Lebanese position was advice "not to wait" because the 
waiting policy is futile. The sources added that the U.S. side 
did not conceal its view that the Lebanese policy of waiting for 
progress on the Syrian track is "provoking the Israelis." The 
official sources pointed out that the Americans believe that 
matters are proceeding acceptably on the Syrian and Jordanian 
tracks and are making some progress and that, therefore, it 
would be natural to resume negotiations on the Lebanese track. 
The Lebanese officials, however, prefer to make sure that all 
is well on the Syrian track before taking any stand on the 
resumption of negotiations on the Lebanese track. The Lebanese 
official sources said that the U.S. side has for some time been 
asking Lebanon to revive the negotiation sessions in Washington 
but Lebanon's policy has been one of waiting until progress is 
made before taking any steps in that respect. 
  The official sources also told AL-HAYAH that the U.S. 
request, which was passed on along with the Israeli ultimatum 
that "a relentless war" would be waged on Lebanon and all 
Hizballah positions in Lebanon if the latter retaliated to the 
raid on al-Biqa' with suicide operations inside [Israel] and 
abroad, was what prompted President Ilyas al-Hirawi to say in a 
speech last Thursday that "we will not single anyone out and 
will not allow anyone to single us out," and which prompted 
Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri to say yesterday that 
Syria was the target of the aggression on al-Biqa', and also 
prompted Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri to declare the rejection 
of separate peace. 
  Official sources say that there is increasing pressure on 
Syria in connection with the negotiations, the aim being to 
isolate it in order to soften its position by luring Jordan into 
the bilateral negotiations, but that would in practice be very 
difficult to do with Lebanon.

<F P=106> [Article by chief editor Talal Salman: "The Nation Is Under </F>
International Oil Guardianship."] 
  [Text] International guardianship over the Arabs from the 
Atlantic to the Gulf has come full circle with Yemen. 
  The "war of the brothers", indeed the "war against 
ourselves" 
was noticeably delayed until oil was discovered in commercial 
quantities in the "two parts of that country." This delay shows 
the design: For the United States to get its hands on Arab oil 
wherever it is, always in the name of international legality, 
and to implement this international legality's resolutions to 
prevent the Arabs from burning themselves with their own oil, 
just like children playing with matches. 
  What is important is that, as of today, a "Security Council" 
is the arbiter between one Yemen and another, deciding for each 
miserable "part" what is good for it, what is bad, and what is 
forbidden. The primary taboo is for Yemen to unite as a sound, 
capable entity able to compensate for its historical misery by 
exploiting its natural resources. 
  In the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf where "sovereignty" 
belongs to the kingdom of black gold and white silence, everyone 
is under the direct protection of several junior officers of the 
U.S. Armed Forces. No ruler tenders an offer without their 
permission or buys a motorcycle without their approval. Indeed, 
those officers decide "what is needed", who to buy from, the 
price, and the commission. These officers alone have the right 
to "instruct" the sultans when and how much "democracy" to grant 
to their citizens. Democracy there cannot be attained except 
with the use of U.S. crutches, one of which would preferably be 
a "Wahhabite" [form of Islam prevalent in Saudi Arabia] crutch 
and the other a "revanchist" crutch with a mentality harking 
back to such a distant past that it sees in Wahhabism an 
atheistic, destructive ideology. 
  Although everyone in that region was committed to the logic 
of "market economy", even prior to the official declaration of 
U.S. protection, they were not required to adhere to the other 
side of that baleful coin, namely human rights and political 
pluralism. 
  While Kuwait, in U.S. eyes, is "more than a protectorate but 
less than a negro [Zinji] quarter," this does not spare it the 
necessity of surrounding itself with a legendary barricade 
extending through the desert along the entire length of its 
"border" with Iraq, filled with such luxuries as refrigeration, 
cool water, and rugby and baseball fields. This will guarantee 
that it will be a golden burial ground for the remaining oil 
revenues, the so-called "fund for future generations," which the 
"shaykhs" used to save for a rainy day. 
  Meanwhile, an irrevocable international sentence has been 
passed against Iraq, with no room for appeal. The sentence is 
to keep the tyrant safe and sound, but to execute the people, 
with their various Arab, Kurdish, Turkoman, Assyrian, Chaldean, 
Babylonian, Muslim, Christian, Sabian, and Yazidi sects and the 
remnants of the fire-worshipping Magi. 
  A more serious matter is the starving of the Iraqis while 
their huge oil reserves go to waste. Their tall refineries 
stand still and their thousand-kilometer pipelines stretch to 
the gulfs and seas, empty like their treasury, their wallets, 
and home refrigerators. 
  If we assume that the fate of the eastern triangle--Jordan, 
Syria, and Lebanon--hinges on what Israel, the "local" strategic 
ally, decides is best for U.S. interests in this region, then 
the option offered to the countries forming this triangle is as 
follows: Either an Egypt-like Camp David arrangement with a 
U.S.- dominated multinational observer force or a 
Gaza/Jericho-like agreement with local police serving under 
Israeli command. 
  The non-oil-producing countries--Sudan, Tunisia, Morocco, 
and 
Mauritania--can suffer a slow death and crawl on their bellies, 
asking, today or tomorrow, for bits of the U.S. food surplus. 
  Or they can die in mass extermination orgies, as in Somalia. 
  Libya, however, and later on Algeria, must pay a retroactive 
price for their revolutionary pretensions. Thus, sanctions are 
imposed on the Libyan people, who know hardly anything about the 
world, politics, or the taste of living. A ring of fire 
surrounds Libya, impenetrable to even a single plane, even 
medical or fire-fighting emergency flights to the oil fields. 
  How dare someone to whom fate has given fabulous wealth, 
more 
than they can personally use, speak of revolution, unity, the 
liberation of Palestine, and jihad against Israel? 
  Therefore, it is necessary to condemn the entire Libyan 
nation and fight it as if it were a scourge or contagious 
disease. It must repent publicly, give up its wealth, and kill 
with its own hand everything that remotely refers to revolution, 
today, tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow. They might even 
require the Libyan nation to dig up the grave of its heroic 
martyr 'Umar al-Mukhtar, who was hanged by the Italian 
colonialists, put his remains on trial, and hang him (again) on 
the charge of prior incitement against the new world order and 
the U.S. monopoly of Arab oil. 
  As for Algeria, let it sink gradually into an open-ended 
civil war that will sap the state's and the people's energies so 
that the oil and natural gas can remain in the hands of the U.S. 
master, who will "hasten" alone to save the one-million-martyr 
country from drowning in a multibillion-dollar debt, the 
interest on which would eat up the world. 
  All Arabs are minors, wards of international guardianship. 
  In accordance with international legality's resolutions, 
every "Arab" has a compulsory guardian (generally American and 
only occasionally European) who makes decisions for him. 
  The oil belongs to those who discovered and extracted it, 
laid its pipelines, built its refineries, and shipped it to the 
"developed society," which deserves to enjoy its revenues since 
it is qualified to utilize it as a source of energy that has a 
decisive influence on the world's destiny and humanity's fate. 
  After Israel's and the oil's future is guaranteed, no 
worries 
will remain except this exceptional population increase in the 
backward Arab societies. There can be no solution to this 
except for the Arabs to exterminate each other. 
  Hence, the map of the Arab homeland resembles a lake of 
futilely shed blood, all of it true Arab blood. 
  Only when it comes to killing is there no guardianship of 
the 
Arabs. In this they are free, to the point of total chaos. 
  The more the Arabs shed their own cheap blood, the greater 
the share for the U.S. West (including Israel) of their precious 
oil. 
  Thank God that Lebanon is not an oil country. Otherwise its 
civil war would have continued until the last drop of its 
stalwart sons' blood was shed.

  [Text] The Lebanese National Congress concluded its 
meetings in Paris today. General Michel 'Awn had called for 
this conference, which was attended by Dory Sham'un, leader of 
the National Liberal Party and many Lebanese expatriates and 
opposition figures, in addition to French figures from the 
Senate and National Assembly. Our colleague Salim Badawi will 
tell us about the final session, decisions, and recommendations: 
  [Begin Badawi recording] [First,] declaring the foundation 
of 
the Lebanese National Congress as a comprehensive united 
institution that embraces the national current whose objective 
is to achieve Lebanon's freedom, independence, and full 
sovereignty over all its territories within its 
internationally-recognized historical border. 
  Second, the constituent body of the congress, together with 
those in charge of it, will form a constituent assembly to draft 
its bylaw and to appoint its legislative and executive staff. 
  Third, the congress announces the formation of the board of 
trustees under the chairmanship of the secretary general who 
will be in charge of running, organizing, and activating the 
general secretariat. 
  Fourth, the congress announces the formation of the national 
assembly, which will be considered the legislative body of the 
congress. 
  On the other hand, the Lebanese National Congress defined 
its 
militant priorities through the following objectives: 
  [First,] liberation through organizing ties of cohesion and 
cooperation among the Lebanese to activate their role toward 
expanding the field of militant action on the Lebanese and 
international levels. 
  Second, mobilizing the potentials of the Lebanese throughout 
the world to influence the decisionmakers, particularly in the 
five permanent members of the Security Council. 
  Third, the congress will establish ties with international 
and regional organizations -- East and West -- particularly the 
ones that have influence on the Lebanese future. 
  Fourth, the congress charged the board of trustees with 
following up dialogue and constitutional studies with prominent 
Lebanese and international experts to lay out and present 
alternative options to the sectarian system so that this will 
prepare for a secular political system that transfers power from 
the sects to the government. 
  Regarding the peace process, the congress believes that the 
Israeli-Arab peace process, which began in Madrid in the wake of 
the Gulf war, constitutes the most important political framework 
to the Lebanese future. The statement adds: It would be a big 
danger to Lebanon's sovereignty and independence if Lebanon 
participated in the talks through a government whose 
decisionmaking is captive and seized and which lacks legitimacy 
and popular authorization. 
  The final statement adds: Lebanon insists that its war has 
not ended, its peace will not be genuine, and its people will 
never enjoy sovereignty, freedom, and independence so long as 
the non-Lebanese forces have not withdrawn from all the Lebanese 
territory, in accordance with Security Council Resolutions 425 
and 520. Lebanon is eager to have excellent relations with all 
its neighbors, not distinguished with any party. The congress 
also called for achieving a solid and comprehensive Lebanese 
reconciliation among the Lebanese leaders who agree on 
negotiations to liberate Lebanon within the framework of a 
transitional government that represents all parties that accept 
the principle of peace and work toward this objective. [end

  [Text] President Hafiz al-Asad has issued Law No. 5 dated 
12 June 1994, which represents the state's general budget for 
1994. 
  Finance Minister Muhammad Khalid al-Mahayini told a Syrian 
Arab News Agency correspondent that the state budget for 1994 
amounts to 144.162 billion Syrian pounds. Of this amount, 
76.198 billion pounds will be earmarked for current general 
expenditure, and 67.964 billion pounds for investment projects; 
that is, 47.14 percent of the entire state budget. This high 
ration reflects the importance of development projects in this 
budget, in addition to the requirements of general expenditure 
for national security and general services for the people. 
  The minister added that most of the state's general budget 
is 
based on domestic resources, thus affirming the principle of 
self-reliance, in addition to rationalizing the current public 
expenditure, especially administrative expenditures. The budget 
also included the necessary allocations to meet President's 
Hafiz al-Asad generous gift to the working class, represented by 
increasing salaries and remunerations for the state employees, 
increasing the pensions, increasing the heating allowance, and 
changes in prices as of 1 May 1994. 
  The minister said that the Finance Ministry issued orders to 
implement the 1994 state budget law and to disburse the amounts 
allocated this year for all public departments of an 
administrative nature in the state. It also issued documents 
related to approval of estimated allocations for the economic 
public sector for 1994.

<F P=106> [Article by correspondent Ayman Mari'] </F>
  [Excerpts] In the first meeting of its 13th ordinary 
session, the People's Assembly listened to the statement of 
Finance Minister Dr. Khalid al-Mahayini on the draft state 
budget for fiscal year 1994. 
  The statement notes that the general state budget is one of 
the most important tools of financial planning in view of its 
role in creating new revenues and productive capabilities and 
promoting the process of economic and social development. 
  The importance of the general state budget also lies in the 
formation of the Gross Domestic Product [GDP] through public 
spending, especially since most government expenditure on 
investment and public consumption takes place through the state 
budget. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Draft Budget Appropriations </H5>
  The draft state budget's appropriations for 1994 reached 
133.528 billion Syrian pounds, of which the sum of 66.181 
billion pounds is for current expenditure and 67.644 billion 
Syrian pounds is for investment expenditure. 
  The total appropriations in the 1994 budget are 8.78 percent 
more than the total appropriations in the 1993 budget. 
  Initial estimates show that as a result of the increase in 
the wages, annuities, and allowances for civil servants, the 
appropriations in the 1994 draft budget of 1994 are expected to 
rise to 142 billion pounds. This is in addition to the impact 
of these increases in the budgets of the economic public sector, 
administrative units, and awqaf departments. 
  The appropriations for investment operations in 1994 include 
an appropriation to back the capital of certain public sector 
firms by the sum of 350 million pounds. 
  We must point out that the job opportunities to be created 
by 
the public expenditure appropriations in the 1994 draft budget 
are estimated at 70,376 jobs distributed as follows: 25,368 job 
opportunities in the administrative sector and 30,008 job 
opportunities in the economic sector. This is in addition to 
approximately 15,000 job opportunities resulting from 
implementing investment projects. 
<H5>  Public Expenditure Appropriations: </H5>
  A. The appropriations of the 1994 draft budget have been 
distributed as follows: 
<H5>  Wages, Remunerations and Allowances </H5>
  The appropriations that have been allocated for wages, 
remunerations, and allowances in the 1994 draft budget have 
reached 19.282 billion pounds compared to 17.406 billion pounds 
in 1993; in other words, an increase of 1.876 billion pounds or 
an increase of 10.77 percent. The wages, remunerations, and 
allowances constitute 29.13 percent of the total appropriations 
for current expenditure in the 1994 draft budget. 
<H5>  Administrative Expenditures </H5>
  The appropriations of administrative expenditures in the 
1994 
draft budget reached 7.742 billion pounds compared to 6.387 
billion pounds in the 1993 budget; in other words, an increase 
of 1.355 billion pounds or 21.21 percent. Administrative 
expenditures in the 1994 draft budget constitute 11.7 percent of 
the budget. 
<H5>  Transferable Expenditures </H5>
  The appropriations for transferable expenditures have 
reached 
3.079 billion pounds compared to 2.627 billion pounds in 1993; 
in other words, an increase of 452 million pounds or 17.2 
percent. 
<H5>  Debts and Obligations </H5>
  The appropriations under this column in the 1994 draft 
budget 
are 5.465 billion pounds compared to 5.644 billion pounds; in 
other words a reduction of 179 million pounds. The 
appropriations under this column constitute 8.26 percent of the 
total current expenditure appropriations in the 1994 draft 
budget. 

<H5>    Investment Projects </H5>
  B. Appropriations for investment projects in 1994. 
  The 1994 investment plan has been drawn up on the basis of 
several main considerations which can be summed up as follows: 
  -- Giving priority in investments in the 1994 budget to 
electricity projects (generators, transformers, transport, and 
distribution). 
  -- Concentrating on replacement and renovation projects in 
existing intermediary industries in addition to new projects 
which are ready to be contracted in this field. 
  -- Concentrating on irrigation and agrarian reform projects. 
  -- Continuing the emphasis on giving priority to 
agricultural 
projects, especially in research and productivity. 
  -- Concentrating on backing existing projects with the view 
to completing and achieving tangible material progress in their 
implementation, especially the projects on health, sewage, 
drinking water, all stages of education, and automation in the 
banking and insurance fields. 
  In light of the above, the appropriations for investment 
projects in the 1994 draft budget have been fixed at a total sum 
of 67.3 billion pounds distributed as follows: 
  -- 42.8 billion pounds or 63.6 percent of the total 
appropriations will come from internal revenues. 
  -- 24.5 billion pounds or 36.4 percent of the total 
appropriations will come from foreign revenues. 
  This is in addition to the investment expenditure of the 
private and mixed sectors, the investment expenditure on 
services contracts of companies which carry out exploration and 
prospecting work and investment in oil and gas projects where 
the total actual expenditure on these companies reached 
$4.316293 billion until 31 December 1993. The planned 
investment expenditure for 1994 is $478.793 million [dollar 
figures as published] 
<H5>  General Revenues-Internal and External </H5>
  The internal revenues in the 1994 draft budget are estimated 
at 97.926 billion pounds compared to 80.124 billion pounds in 
the 1993 state budget; in other words, an increase of 17.802 
billion pounds or 22.22 percent. 
  These estimates are expected to be increased by 
approximately 
7.1 billion pounds to reflect the recent wage increases from 1 
May to 31 December 1994. 
  As for foreign revenues they were estimated at 24.53 billion 
pounds compared to 31.868 billion pounds in the 1993 budget. 
  The following is a summary of the general revenues in the 
draft budget: 
<H5>  Current Revenues </H5>
  The internal current revenue estimates are 77.611 billion 
pounds compared to 61.344 billion pounds in the 1993 state 
budget plus 9 billion pounds that are the aid funds estimates 
for 1993. 
  The estimates of taxes and duties in the 1994 state budget 
are 47.413 billion pounds compared to 36.309 billion pounds in 
1993; in other words an increase of 11.104 billion pounds or an 
average increase of 30.58 percent. 
<H5>  Investment Revenues </H5>
  The internal investment revenue estimates in the 1994 draft 
budget are 20.315 billion pounds compared to 18.780 billion 
pounds in the 1993 budget. 
  Foreign investment revenue estimates (loans and credit 
facilities) in the 1994 draft budget are 24.53 billion pounds 
compared to 22.868 billion pounds in the 1993 budget. [passage

<F P=106> [Article by 'Imad al-Karaki: "Conclusion of Several </F>
Contracts and Joint Ventures with British Businessmen"] 
  [Excerpts] An economic delegation from the London Chamber 
of Commerce and Industry visited Syria last week to increase 
trade between the two countries and to get acquainted with the 
investment climate following the issuance of Investment Law No. 
10 of 1991. The delegation met with businessmen in Damascus and 
Aleppo and held meetings with the Syrian Chambers of Commerce 
and Industry and several government officials. The meetings 
with the businessmen resulted in the signing of several 
contracts with owners of industrial firms. The delegation 
examined economic feasibility studies on several projects, 
foremost the "plastic insulation" project, at the Damascus 
Chamber of Commerce. It was decided that the British will 
provide expertise while Syria will provide local raw materials 
and manpower for this project. 
  The other important point raised was that the British side 
will study Investment Law No. 10, since not many British 
businessmen and investors are fully aware of it. The Aleppo 
Chamber of Commerce requested the British delegation to dispatch 
a legal mission from Britain to read this law and to explain it 
to British businessmen at the chamber's expense. The British 
delegation proposed dispatching a woman lawyer who is also a 
board member in the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry to 
compile a study on the law. [passage omitted] 
  The British delegation expressed its satisfaction with the 
Syrian laws regulating foreign trade and also with the 
Investment Law. Several contracts were signed between Syrian and 
British businessmen. The members of the delegation affirmed 
that they will return to Syria to conclude other projects which 
they are studying and that businessmen outside the London 
Chamber of Commerce and industry might also visit Syria.

  [Text] Damascus (SANA) -- The comrades party branch 
secretaries and governors concluded their meetings last night. 
  Comrade Sulayman Qaddah, assistant regional secretary of the 
Ba'th Party, made a speech at the conclusion of these meetings 
in which he urged the participants to hold immediate meetings 
with the party and popular bases in order to explain the 
dimensions and importance of what took place at the meetings; in 
order to deepen the relationship between the party leaderships 
and the party, popular, and professional bases by constantly 
following up on the implementation of action plans; and in order 
to broaden the bases of the party, the popular organizations, 
and professional unions, to tighten their organizational 
structures, and to consolidate national unity behind the 
historic leadership of the comrade party secretary general and 
leader struggler Hafiz al-Asad, who feels the people's pulse and 
gives their affairs and livelihood all the care and attention 
they deserve as illustrated by the recent increase in wages, 
remunerations, and heating and cost of living allowances to 
government employees and retirees. 
  Qaddah affirmed the need to develop work methods and 
formulas 
and to listen to the masses so as to strengthen ties with them 
and to pool their resources for the construction process led by 
the Ba'th Party. He called for exerting greater efforts and 
rising to the level of pan-Arab and national responsibility in 
order to achieve the aims of our party and people: namely, 
unity, freedom, and socialism. 
  The meetings of the party branch secretaries and governors 
under Dr. Qaddah were attended by Prime Minister Mahmud 
al-Zu'bi, members of the Regional Command, the two deputy prime 
ministers, some comrade ministers and deputies, heads of party 
bureaus, chairman of the Party Control and Inspection 
Commission, presidents of universities, and directors of media 
institutions. The conferees commended the generous offer by 
leader Hafiz al-Asad, the comrade party secretary general and 
president of the republic, in increasing the wages of government 
employees and the annuities of retirees. 
  The conferees continued their discussion of the items on 
their agenda. The leaders of popular organizations and 
professional unions continued to make their comments on the 
organizational and professional conditions of their 
organizations and unions and the great progress that has been 
made in expanding their bases and strengthening the solid 
national unity behind the historic and unique leadership of the 
comrade party secretary general and leader struggler Hafiz 
al-Asad. The comrade deputy prime minister for services affairs 
answered questions on drinking water and sewage. Other ministers 
answered questions in their specialized fields. 
  Prime Minister Mahmud al-Zu'bi addressed the meeting. He 
presented a general and detailed review of the economic 
developments which Syria has witnessed and is witnessing and the 
measures which it has taken and is taking to develop and 
strengthen the national economy in order to respond to the needs 
of the homeland and the citizens. He referred to the measures 
which are being taken to tackle the affairs of the national 
economy through self-reliance. He affirmed that the course of 
economic plurality initiated by the comrade party secretary 
general President Hafiz al-Asad has enabled all citizens to 
participate in building the homeland and provided a solid 
economic base which has enabled and continues to enable Syria to 
cope with the pressures which it has faced and is still facing 
in order to influence its national and pan-Arab decision. He 
affirmed that Syria is strong with its people and leader comrade 
struggler Hafiz al-Asad. 
  The comrade prime minister cited new economic data which, he 
said, proves the strength of our national economy and the 
soundness of the policy directed by leader Hafiz al-Asad so that 
Syria will remain strong, depending on its own people and 
available national resources. He affirmed that Syria has great 
capabilities which continue to grow and that best exploitation 
of these capabilities will ensure the wellbeing of our people 
and also lead to further economic development and best 
exploitation and distribution of national resources. 
  The comrade prime minister referred to the measures which 
are being taken to tackle conditions in the industrial public 
sector, to operate factories at maximum capacity; to add new 
capabilities by increasing, improving, and diversifying 
production to meet the needs of local consumption; and to 
constantly increase, develop, and diversify Syrian exports. He 
also referred to the measures which are being taken to develop 
the agricultural sector and to provide capital goods. He 
explained with figures and facts the importance of what has 
already been achieved in this sector in order to ensure people's 
food through self-reliance. 
  The comrade prime minister spoke about the efforts which are 
being exerted to expand the base of productive investments 
through the public, private, and mixed sectors in implementation 
of the policy of economic plurality and to encourage the 
participation of all citizens in building the homeland. He 
referred to the number of projects which have been carried out 
so far under the Encouragement of Investment Law No. 10 of 1991, 
which reaffirms the soundness of the policies, measures, and 
procedures which are being taken to continuously develop the 
national economy. 
  The comrade prime minister also spoke about the measures 
which are being taken to ensure the citizens' needs of 
commodities and basic foodstuffs under good specifications and 
at reasonable prices and to prevent supply suffocations and 
price speculation. He explained the importance of the measures 
which have been taken in this regard. He affirmed that these 
measures will be continued and developed in order to protect 
both consumers and producers. He also referred to the measures 
which are being taken to achieve a greater financial and 
economic equilibrium, affirming that these measures will be 
further entrenched in order to develop our national economy and 
achieve a comprehensive, balanced, and continuous development. 
  The comrade prime minister also affirmed that efforts are 
being continued to carry out more services projects for the sake 
of the people's wellbeing and social progress. He referred to 
the large investments which are being put into different 
projects, including drinking water, health care, sewage, 
electricity, and other essential services for the people. 
  The comrade prime minister referred to the great generous 
offer which was made by comrade struggler Hafiz al-Asad to the 
sons of our people represented by the increase in the wages of 
civil servants and the annuities of retirees. This increases 
the awareness of the masses that leader struggler Hafiz al-Asad 
feels the people's pulse and suffering in all sincerity and 
honesty. This generous gesture, which is the biggest wage 
increase to be given to civil servants and retirees so far and 
which will amount to more than 18 billion Syrian pounds 
annually, confirms the strength of our national economy, he 
said. He added that Syria is strong with its people and leader 
Hafiz al-Asad and that nothing will stop it from proceeding 
toward achieving our people's national and pan-Arab aims. 
  The comrade secretaries of the party branches and governors 
continued their meetings yesterday morning under Dr. Sulayman 
Qaddah. The meeting was attended by comrades 'Abd-al-Qadir 
Qaddurah, speaker of the People's Assembly; Mahmud al-Zu'bi, 
prime minister; members of the Regional Command, the two deputy 
prime ministers; some ministers; the chairman of the Party 
Control and Inspection Commission; the deputy heads of party 
bureaus; the presidents of universities; and the directors of 
media institutions. 
  Comrade Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' presented a review 
of 
the recent political developments on the Arab and international 
levels. He said: The landslides and repercussions resulting 
from the breakup of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia and the 
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait are still continuing in one form or 
another on the regional and international levels. 
  Al-Shar' added: The world is still going through a 
transitional phase full of great challenges after the old 
international system has collapsed without being replaced by a 
new international order of sound and balanced international 
relations. The situation in the Arab homeland has also been 
further fragmented as a result of the Gulf War. Inter-Arab 
relations are weak and loose, Arab obligations have receded, and 
Arab solidarity has deteriorated to a lower level. 
  Having reviewed the current situation in Iraq, the blockade 
imposed on Libya, the events that took place in Somalia, the 
regrettable developments in Algeria, and the recent tragic 
conflagration in Yemen, Al-Shar' said: These grave developments 
and challenges could not have been confronted so wisely and 
courageously were it not for the Corrective Movement and the 
unique leadership of struggler President Hafiz al-Asad. 
  Al-Shar' added: The Corrective Movement and its historic 
leader are the strongest guarantee and fortification for Arab 
Syria in facing the different challenges on the Arab and 
international levels. He said: Syria has remained sincere to 
its course, loyal to its principles, and its leader President 
Hafiz al-Asad has always made the correct and courageous 
decisions which express the nation's concerns and legitimate 
aspirations and continuously adhere to Arab solidarity and the 
common interests and destiny of the Arab nation. 
  The comrade foreign minister affirmed that Syria's pan-Arab 
role in Lebanon and its concern for its unity and national 
reconciliation have prevented that country from becoming another 
Bosnia or Afghanistan. Al-Shar' said: The wise decision which 
was made by the president at the Cairo summit following the 
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait had spared the Arabs from an even more 
disastrous and dangerous situation. He added: This Syrian Arab 
stand greatly reduced the losses and damages and preserved a 
minimum level of mutual Arab obligations, at least among the 
eight Arab states which signed the Damascus Declaration. 
  The comrade foreign minister affirmed that during the 
occupation of Kuwait, Israel had planned to have a say in Arab 
decisions and resources and to normalize its relations with the 
Arab Gulf states and other Arab states without withdrawing from 
the occupied Arab territories or committing itself to 
implementing the UN resolutions relating to the Arab-Israeli 
conflict and the Palestine question. 
  The comrade foreign minister added: The U.S. initiative, 
which is based on UN resolutions and international legitimacy 
and the principle of land for peace, would not have materialized 
in its present form were it not for Syria and the well-known 
resolve and wisdom of its leader, as well as the support of the 
sincere ones among his Arab brothers who adhered to the 
achievement of just and comprehensive peace based on 
international legitimacy and the UN resolutions. 
  The comrade foreign minister reviewed the stages of the 
peace 
process and its recent developments in light of the continued 
U.S. efforts, despite Israel's attempts to place obstacles from 
to time on the path of this process. In this regard, comrade 
al-Shar' referred to the deportation of more than 400 
Palestinians, the Hebron massacre and the acts of murder and 
suppression which followed it, the siege on the occupied 
territories and Holy Jerusalem, and Israel's continuous 
aggressions on Lebanon. He also referred to Israel's desperate 
efforts to play down the impact and results of the Geneva summit 
between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton. 
  The comrade foreign minister affirmed that Syria's adherence 
to its national and pan-Arab principles is neither stubbornness 
nor extremism but a sincere expression of its firm desire to 
achieve the option which Syria has chosen out of its own free 
will in order to achieve just and comprehensive peace which ends 
Israeli occupation, guarantees Arab rights, and ensures security 
and stability for everyone in the region. 
  After the comrade foreign minister had replied to all 
questions and queries from the comrade participants, the 
conferees continued to make their comments on organizational, 
educational, and other public issues concerning the citizens.

<F P=106> [Press review] </F>
  [Text] Under the headline "The Separate Solution and the 
Carrot Policy," TISHRIN says in an editorial: The separate 
solution cannot guarantee dignity or rights to those who chose 
it as a means to end the conflict with Israel. The Gaza-Jericho 
agreement is fresh, living proof of this. 
  The paper adds: The Oslo agreement maintained the Israeli 
economic hegemony and turned the self-rule leaders into tax 
collectors begging for help and charity from the Arab and world 
financial centers. 
  The paper stresses that the separate solution means 
abandoning the international legitimacy and UN resolutions, as 
well as the principles on which the peace process was based. It 
also means that Israel is appointed the only point of reference 
for all agreements and steps that may be accomplished. 
  The paper adds: Israel is not only eating the carrot, but 
also the hand that extends it. 
  The paper reviews the ceaseless aggressive Israeli conduct 
toward the Arabs, the oppressive and repressive acts in the 
occupied Arab territories, the acts of piracy against Lebanon, 
and its continued attempts to implement plans for hegemony and 
tutelage over the region. 
  TISHRIN concludes: Separate solutions will not bring 
security, peace, or dignity to the Arabs; nor will they return 
to them their usurped rights. That is why Israel adopted such 
solutions. That is also why Syria opposed them and adhered to 
the comprehensive solution that will allow the Arab parties to 
negotiate from a position of strength and force Israel to make a 
full withdrawal and recognize the Arab rights in full. 
  Under the headline "Christopher's Tour And What Is Required 
From The United States," AL-BA'TH says: U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher will be returning to the region and we do not 
know if he will be carrying anything new to deal with the 
conditions for a just, lasting, and comprehensive peace. 
However, Secretary Christopher knows that the obstruction comes 
from Israel, and not the Arabs. It is Israel which is occupying 
the Arabs' territory, staging aggression against them every day, 
and defying the international will. 
  The paper notes that the new endeavor must have new 
determination, not less than that displayed by Foster Dulles and 
the late U.S. President Eisenhower during the tripartite 
aggression against Egypt. 
  The paper adds: We do not want the United States to be in 
conflict with its ally, Israel, but we do not want it to be 
against the Arabs, especially since it has seen the Arabs' 
concern for what is right. 
  The paper stresses that the Syria of Hafiz al-Asad does not 
bargain, nor does it gamble with its national and pan-Arab 
principles as some people have done and are doing. 
  AL-BA'TH concludes by saying: Before Christopher's departure 
for the region, Israeli Prime Minister Rabin said that he sticks 
to occupation and refuses to withdraw from the Golan Heights. 
Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres also played down the 
significance of the U.S. secretary's visit. We therefore feel 
that Israel is seeking to foil or call off the event. This 
shows the extent of Israel's obstruction of peace and the peace 
efforts. 
  Under the headline "The Israeli Obstruction," AL-THAWRAH 
says: If it was not for Israel's intransigent conduct, the peace 
process would have made great strides toward achieving its 
objective. Israel's insistence on depriving the peace process of 
its substance and diverting it from its correct course prevented 
any progress. 
  The paper feels that effective pressure must be applied 
against Israel to force it to change its policy into a serious 
policy that agrees with the international will and responds, 
without any hesitation, to the requirements of peace, 
particularly complete withdrawal from all occupied Arab 
territories. 
  AL-THAWRAH concludes by saying: The United States is the 
only party that can apply such pressure on Israel since it is 
one of the peace process sponsors and the source of the 
unjustified support for Israel. Will the United States start 
exercising its responsibility in showing concern for continuing 
the peace process until it achieves its goal of a just and 
comprehensive peace? 
  In another commentary entitled "Who Rejects Peace," 
AL-THAWRAH says: Israel's attempts to cast doubts on Syria's 
intentions toward peace constitute an aggression against the 
international legitimacy, which acknowledged that there can be 
no peace in the Middle East without Syria. 
  The paper stresses that Syria will not allow Israel to 
deprive peace of its just substance.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: With the U.S. Secretary of State 
reportedly due for another Middle East tour this month, it is 
worth remembering the Middle East peacemaking role to which Bill 
Clinton's administration committed itself when it came to power. 
We have no doubt in our mind that the United States has 
abdicated that role -- the role of evenhanded broker and full 
partner. The United States cannot be unaware of the neutrality 
and evenhandedness that such a role presupposes if it is to lead 
to the establishment of a peace predicated on justice. 
  Israel, however, does not want the United States to play 
such 
a role. Invariably, Israel is prepared to empty any 
international role of its content if it is based on the 
principles of international legitimacy and justice. 
  No wonder top Israeli officials have advised against another 
tour of the Middle East by the U.S. secretary of state. Israel 
has no need for forward movement in the peace process; it wants 
Washington to stay as strongly biased to its wrongheadedness and 
aggression as it has been for the past half century and to 
continue as its protector in international forums. Israeli 
leaders are anxious for the United States to be little more than 
a false witness to separate deals that impose Israel's terms on 
the Arab states one by one, thereby enabling it not only to 
retain Arab territory but to ensure its edge over the combined 
Arabs. 
  We do not think the U.S. administration, the one superpower 
on Earth, which has taken on the challenge of bringing peace to 
this region, will acquiesce in its role being so reduced. The 
United States is much too important a world power to bow to the 
will of a recalcitrant party flying in the face of international 
law and UN resolutions. It does not serve the interests of the 
United States to let Israel have its own way and dictate its own 
terms for a peace settlement in the region. U.S. interests are 
best served by an egalitarian and enduring peace. 
  Warren Christopher, having come to the region many times, is 
now fully conversant with the respective positions of the Middle 
East players. He is all too aware which side wants peace and 
which side is placing obstacles in its path. For peace to come 
to the region, the UN resolutions -- the underpinnings of the 
Madrid conference and the peace process -- must be implemented. 
This is especially true, since, by the admission of their 
advocates, separate deals will not produce peace. Far from 
leading to peace, such an approach will only minimize its 
chances. 
  If Mr. Christopher is coming to the region to propel the 
peace process on the Syrian track forward, he needs to come up 
with new ideas and clear answers to the core questions posed by 
Damascus when the U.S. secretary was last here. The future of 
the peace process largely depends on the kind of answers he 
brings. 
  We do not think the U.S. administration will put its 
credibility and reputation on the line and renounce its pivotal 
role in the peace process. Nor do we think Washington will take 
the trouble of sending its chief diplomat to the region without 
giving him ideas that will make his trip worth the bother. 
  Peace is a noble endeavor to which Syria is dedicated; 
President Clinton's administration and the whole world know this 
is the case. However, Damascus is pursuing an all-encompassing 
and fair peace -- the peace of the brave. This, too, is known 
to Washington and the whole world to be the case. 
  If Israel wants this kind of peace, it knows the road 
leading 
there. If not, it will remain an unrealizable dream.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] Under the headline "Falsifying Facts Does Not Serve 
the Peace Process," AL-BA'TH newspaper editorial says: 
Although the entire world is now aware that Israel is 
responsible for halting the peace process, and, consequently for 
the inability of the bilateral peace talks in Washington to 
achieve what they were supposed to achieve, the Tel Aviv 
government still insists on reversing and falsifying facts by 
claiming that Syria is behind the failure to achieve the 
supposed breakthrough in the peace talks. 
  The paper says that Israel continues to repeat this because 
Syria, from the outset of the peace talks, has been rejecting 
any peace outside the Madrid formula, stressing that peace 
should be based on the resolutions of international legitimacy. 
  AL-BA'TH adds: This position basically conflicts with the 
known Israeli plans to drag the Arab parties into signing 
separate peace deals which would acknowledge everything Israel 
wants. 
  AL-BA'TH notes that Syria's consistent and positive position 
on the peace process has been described by the U.S. 
administration and all world governments as the key to regional 
peace. The paper adds: The Geneva summit results and President 
Hafiz al-Asad's statements proved without any doubt that Syria 
is truly working for a just and comprehensive peace in the 
region, especially since the president stressed full withdrawal 
in return for full peace. In this regard, the paper points to 
the U.S. President's reply that Syria has the right to demand 
the establishment of a just and comprehensive peace. 
  AL-BA'TH continues: Definitely, this U.S. statement was 
based on the facts of the regional conflict, and, consequently, 
on a conviction that it is impossible for partial and separate 
solutions to bring about regional security, peace, and stability. 
  Concluding, AL-BA'TH says: Despite all that happened and may 
happen, the region will remain far from the real peace 
emphasized by the international community, unless there is full 
and absolute commitment to implementing all the requirements of 
a just and comprehensive peace, chief of which is a 
comprehensive Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories. 
  In the "With the Events" column, the newspaper AL-BA'TH 
says: 
The road to peace has clear features and signs. It begins with 
the implementation of the UN and Security Council resolutions. 
If this is not achieved, the national resistance in Lebanon 
will continue and will not retreat or compromise. The Israelis 
know better than others the resolve and solidity of this 
resistance. Only justice will triumph.

  [Text] Gentlemen: It is funny that Israeli Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres casts doubts about Syria's peace 
intentions. He said in a statement that he doubts that Damascus 
is prepared for real peace. 
  It is natural that Peres has no evidence of this, while the 
whole world has proof that Israel not only rejects peace, but 
seeks to sabotage it, divide its basic concepts, and besiege its 
objectives. It does this so that peace, which the world thinks 
should be comprehensive and just, is transformed into incomplete 
deals and separate and paralyzed agreements that preserve the 
occupation and strengthen hegemony, and entrenches aggression 
against the Arabs -- aggression which has been continuing since 
1948. 
  The Israel that continues to launch blatant aggressions 
against south Lebanon in the atmosphere of peace for which the 
international community has aspired, does not want peace. The 
Israel that kidnaps a Lebanese citizen, while he was safe among 
his family and children in a condemned act of piracy, does not 
want peace. The Israel that looks at the comprehensive peace 
process through narrow holes, and draws weak parties to the 
cycle of its interests, and exploits them for its objectives, 
does not want peace. It seeks to sabotage peace and to empty it 
of its just humanitarian contents. Israel seeks to change peace 
into mere deals between two parties: one that dictates, and one 
that submissively signs under the pretext of international 
circumstances and developments that cannot be confronted. 
  These are some of Israel's practices aimed at aborting the 
peace process. These practices emphasize that Israel 
understands peace far from its reality, and believes in it away 
from the facts of the region and logic. Israel wants to isolate 
parties, and then replace the comprehensive solution with 
partial solutions that serve its concept of peace and its 
interests while continuing the occupation and dictating other 
conditions that serve its future aggressive objectives. 
Regrettably, Israel has realized what it wants, due to Arab 
division and the weakness of certain parties and individuals as 
a result of shortsightedness, limited vision, and weakness of 
their pan-Arab affiliation and understanding of the objectives 
which the Arab people aspire to realize. 
  Nevertheless, while Syria is seeking to realize 
comprehensive 
and just peace it will never relinquish a grain of sand or a 
single right whether Peres casts doubts or not. No progress in 
the peace talks will be made unless Israel stops these practices 
and responds to the requisites of comprehensive peace, foremost 
of which is full withdrawal from the land to the borders of 4 
June 1967 as one of the pillars of real peace--peace whose 
requisites were understood by the whole world, not the peace 
that Peres speaks about and wants. Peres is fully aware that 
Syria wants peace, and this peace does not cope at all with 
Israel's aggressive aspirations, but it restricts these 
aspirations in a manner that corrects things and restores just 
balances. This is how peace can be realized, and without this 
there will be no peace.

  [Text] United Nations HQ. (New York), June 13, IRNA -- 
Iran's Permanent Envoy to the United Nations Kamal Kharazi today 
protested the U.S. warships and helicopters' interruption and 
chase of Iranian naval boats and helicopters engaged in routine 
duty in the waters of the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman. 
  Kharazi in a letter to the UN Secretary-General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali pointed out 10-cases of interruption by the 
intruding American naval fleet in Iran's regional waters between 
October 20 to February 5, 1994. 
  The Iranian non-military boats and helicopters were on their 
routine inspection tour of off-shore oil platforms when the U.S. 
warships, helicopters and fighters interrupted their course and 
started taking video films and photographs of the Iranian 
installations in the Persian Gulf. 
  The letter was circulated here as a U.N. document today. 
  Last month Iran had protested to America through its 
interest 
section at the Pakistani Embassy in Washington.

  [Text] Tehran, June 14, IRNA -- A morning daily here 
Tuesday wrote that the fresh Amman-Tel Aviv agreement to iron 
out differences has been inked upon the U.S. pressure on Jordan. 
  `TEHRAN TIMES' said in its editorial that apparently Jordan 
has been spurred by the recent U.S. Congress decision to grant a 
financial aid to Israel and by the U.S. white charter to lift 
economic sanction clamped on Israel. 
  "Obviously, the U.S. is determined to resolve the problems 
and challenges it faces in the Middle East before stepping into 
the next century," said the paper. This is of paramount 
significance for the U.S. in view of the fact that Europe, in a 
centrifugal move, created propitious ground to gain independence 
from the U.S. in the post cold war epoch. Now the U.S. strives 
to establish absolute sway over the Middle East in a drive to 
recompense for having lost its grip on Europe, the article noted. 
  "In tune with this strategy, Washington has hastily embarked 
upon accelerating the domino effect of compromise in the Middle 
East," it said, adding "Washington fails to realize that such 
strategies serve only as tranquilizer rather than remedies for 
U.S. allies in the region." 
  Stressing that the Middle East problems can be solved 
through the concerted efforts of all regional peoples, the paper 
concluded by saying that Israel has never been able to conceal 
its true face in the Middle East's political scene no matter 
what mask it has worn.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article from the "Foreign Policy Desk"] </F>
  [Text] Following the announcement of the expulsion of the 
second diplomat from the British Embassy in Tehran by the 
Islamic Republic of Iran's Foreign Ministry, the British 
Government declared that the reason for expelling the Iranian 
diplomat was the dissemination of false documents regarding 
Britain's activities and position on Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  When the British Foreign Office summoned the charge 
d'affaires of the Islamic Republic of Iran in London last week 
and informed him of its decision, it did not divulge the name of 
the expelled diplomat and the reason for this action. 
Yesterday, it announced the name of the Iranian first secretary 
Bilurchi and claimed that he had circulated false documents 
regarding the anti-Muslim policy followed by the British forces 
deployed in that region. 
  The following points may be noted in this regard: 
  1. The British policy with regard to the Bosnian Muslims 
requires no affirmation by means of forged documents as the 
anti- Muslim policy of the British authorities regarding the 
oppressed Bosnian Muslims is known to all. 
  The actions and allegations of the British political and 
military officials are so numerous that their publication would 
require reams and reams of paper. RESALAT has repeatedly 
written that if justice were to prevail in the world, British 
and military representatives such as David Owen should be 
impeached on charges of complicity in the massacre of the 
Bosnian Muslims. 
  The British Government has played the primary role in 
preventing the Muslims from gaining access to arms for their 
defense to save themselves from the Serbs' aggression and by the 
induction of Russia in the political talks on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, it paved the way for further pressure on the 
Muslims. 
  2. The actual point that the British Government wishes to 
conceal by these miscellaneous charges against Iran is the same 
issue of its espionage. The British security officials planted 
a plethora of listening devices in the building of the Iranian 
Embassy in London so that the building cannot be used for normal 
purposes and has to be entirely reconstructed. Such an act has 
completely destroyed the already tarnished position of London. 
  3. Britain's weak point lies not in a diplomatic war but in 
economic pressure. Why should we have such firm economic 
relations with a government that is completely unreliable from 
the political point of view? What is the reason for the centers 
for extensive purchases for Iran's industrial ministries in 
London, especially the office for its oil sales? In addition to 
minimizing economic relations, some thought should be given to 
the transfer of these purchase centers to other countries.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Velayati, who is currently visiting 
Germany on an official invitation from his German counterpart, 
met German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and conveyed a message from 
President Hashemi-Rafsanjani. 
  Among the issues discussed during the meeting were the 
situation in Europe; developments in the European Union [EU] in 
view of the fact that Germany will assume the presidency soon; 
ways of expanding relations between the Islamic Republic of Iran 
and the European Union [EU]; multilateral cooperation with 
Central Asia, the Caucasus, and the Economic Cooperation 
Organization [ECO]. 
  In addition, the head of the Foreign Policy Committee of the 
German parliament and the spokesman for the Social Democratic 
Party [SPD], the opposition, as well as the spokesman of the 
ruling Christian Democrat party met with Dr. Velayati. In the 
course of these talks, the stances of the two countries on 
regional and international issues, especially those pertaining 
to Afghanistan, Turkey, Iraq, and developments in the Middle 
East were elaborated on. 
  Ever since the victory of the Islamic revolution--except for 
the first few years when the SPD under the leadership of Helmut 
Schmidt was in power--relations between the two countries have 
not been able to strengthen under the Christian Democratic Union 
[CDU] led by Helmut Kohl. [sentence as heard] In the period 
that this party has been at the helm, it has achieved some 
victories, such as German unification. In view of the recent 
successes of the CDU in the presidential elections and with its 
gaining the necessary votes in the European parliament, the 
continued rule of this party seems likely in the future. 
  In this period, the relations between Tehran and Bonn have 
been one of the most stable with any European country. Every 
year has witnessed an increase in the number of economic and 
financial exchanges between the two countries. Germany is 
Iran's foremost trading partner and heads the list of importers 
of Iranian commodities. The largest volume of Iran's non-oil 
exports is sent to Germany, which collaborates with Iran in 
numerous infrastructural and industrial projects.

  [Text] Tehran, June 11, IRNA -- President Akbar 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani in his inaugural address to the Second 
Congress of Construction Jihad here today said the country was 
on the road to progress and despite the existing bottlenecks the 
economic situation was in "complete natural gear." 
  He said Iran possesses machineries, industrial raw materials 
and energy sources, which fact should make the path of the 
second 5-year development smoother. 
  The Iranian economy was in a better position today than five 
years ago, he added. 
  On the fuel problem in the country, Hashemi-Rafsanjani said 
Iran would face no problem in this connection since its natural 
gas production of 120 to 130 million cubic meters per day 
exceeds its domestic demand of only 80 million cubic meters. 
  He appreciated the efforts of construction jihad workers and 
reiterated the importance of training and research for the 
country's reconstruction.

  [Text] Tehran, June 11, IRNA -- Leader of Islamic 
revolution Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i blamed those oil-producing 
states who supported hegemonic powers rather than defending the 
rights of their own countries and nations causing sharp fall in 
oil prices. 
  Ayatollah Khamene'i made the remark in the oil-rich city of 
Gachsaran Friday morning on the last day of his four-day tour of 
Kohkiloyeh-Boyer Ahmad Province in southwestern Iran. 
  The leader also said that Iran was the only member of the 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to 
annnounce its stance and seriously insist on it. 
  Ayatollah Khamene'i said that the progress of arrogant 
Europe 
and America is based on oil which belongs to the Middle East, 
Persian Gulf and other Muslim regions. If the Muslims stop the 
export of their oil to the West, the industrial societies would 
be reduced to lifeless shells, he added. 
  Ayatollah Khamene'i further noted that due to the treachery 
of some of the regional allies of Europe and America, oil --the 
backbone of industiral civilzaiton-- is sold at a very low price 
so much so that the West's profit from oil imports and taxes is 
much higher than what the producing countries gain through oil 
exports. 
  Leader of the Islamic revolution said that the awakening of 
the Muslim nations was the only remedy to the problems of the 
Muslim world.

  [Text] The Islamic Republic of Iran and Qatar are planning 
to set up a technical committee to study cooperation in the 
extraction of gas from joint reserves in the Persian Gulf. 
  On his return from Qatar yesterday, Petroleum Minister 
Aqazadeh announced the project. He said: The Islamic Republic 
of Iran and Qatar jointly own a vast gas reserve in the Persian 
Gulf and Qatar has started extracting from it. 
  With the establishment of a committee, which is to meet in 
Tehran next month, the two countries will cooperate in 
exchanging the technical knowledge, utilization, and sale of gas 
from this joint reserve. 
  Petroleum Minister Aqazadeh, who was speaking to our 
correspondent, referred to the upcoming OPEC ministerial session 
to be held 15 June in Vienna. He said: The session was 
discussed with the Qatari petroleum minister. Since there is a 
vast difference between the current oil price and the $21 price 
approved by OPEC, Iran and Qatar--in their capacity as 
members--have made efforts to develop a common stance on how to 
resolve the problems facing OPEC.

  [Text] Private credit institutions will be established soon 
and the Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran will 
guarantee their activities. These establishments will be able 
to receive deposits and can participate in production and 
economic activities nationwide. 
  Central Bank Governor Adeli today explained the activities 
of 
the private credit institutions. He told our correspondent that 
a set of rules and regulations has been prepared allowing those 
who wish to establish such credit institutions to hand over 
their application forms to the Central Bank next week. 
Conditional on approval by the Money and Credit Council, such 
persons will be able to begin their activities. 
  The Central Bank governor added: Such institutions will be 
able to receive deposits and open all kinds of deposit accounts 
apart from the Qarz ol-Hasaneh current accounts [goodwill loans] 
which only banks may deal with. 
  Also, the initial capital for the establishment of such 
institutions should amount to at least five billion riyals and a 
part of the capital should be held in cash in the institution's 
own safe. A part of the deposit should be held at the Central 
Bank. Mr. Adeli said: The highest loan paid out by such 
institutions will be 15 times the deposited capital. 
  According to Mr. Adeli, in this way the Central Bank will be 
able to precisely supervise the activities of the private credit 
institutions and therefore guarantee them. 
  On the rate of profit paid by such institutions he said: 
They 
can expect to pay one percent more profit than the current rate 
paid by [ordinary] credit institutions for the facilities 
provided; and they can determine their own rates for their 
deposit accounts. He stressed that the private credit 
institutions are not allowed to engage in usury transactions and 
will operate according to the law on usury. 
  The Central Bank governor added: The rules and regulations 
for the establishment of such institutions have been approved by 
the Cabinet and by the Money and Credit Council; and following a 
request made by the Central Bank, the Guardians Council 
announced that the action is not against the Constitution or the 
religious laws.

<F P=106> [First Friday prayers sermon by Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, </F>
member of the Council of Guardians and acting Friday prayers 
leader, in Tehran on 10 June -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God the compassionate, the 
merciful. [passage omitted] The first sermon on this Friday, 
because of the issue of the pilgrimage and the events which took 
place in Mecca and Medina, is naturally about that subject. I 
shall talk to you dear ones briefly about it. 
  The first is the issue of that of disavowal. We believe -- 
and his holiness the imam [Khomeyni], God be satisfied with him, 
and the esteemed leader [Khamene'i] have also recommended -- 
that disavowal must be carried out, that the disavowal ritual 
cannot be cancelled and is a duty, and that efforts should be 
made for that duty to be performed in the best manner. 
  This year the House of Al Sa'ud treated the honorable 
Iranian 
pilgrims and the esteemed leader's mission roughly and harshly. 
They kept the mission under siege a few days up to 17 May. The 
siege was ugly. The Saudi forces were in three rows and in 
emplacements; they had brought military hardware, machine guns, 
cannons and tanks; riot squads were there with their riot gear 
and water cannons and such were at hand here and there. 
  It was foreseen from the start that an unpleasant situation 
was imminent. But we said, perhaps we will be able to carry out 
our duty. Then, closer to the mission, we got a tighter circle 
of the besieging troops and stricter traffic restrictions to and 
from the mission. 
  A sister of one of the faithful who lived in an Arab country 
and who had come to visit him was stopped on her return and was 
interrogated for an hour. She was asked: Where were you and 
what was your business. Her address was obtained. There was 
such harsh and dreadful behavior. There was a police state and 
martial law around the mission. 
  Under those circumstances, the question was what to do, 
since 
preserving the sanctity and security of the shrine is a must for 
everyone. That action of the House of Al Sa'ud undermined 
security. Security means pilgrims to the holy house of God must 
be safe. Stationing armed troops and creating a police state and 
an emergency situation would deprive everybody of their 
security. That means everyone would be in fear, lest they are 
arrested, beaten or molested. 
  That action was breaking the security of the shrine. But it 
was clearly foreseen that if we were to hold the ceremony, there 
would be clashes and the desecration of the shrine would be much 
greater; moreover, the lives of pilgrims to the holy house of 
God would be endangered. 
  Under these circumstances it was decided that this year's 
disavowal of infidels ceremonies should not take place. Our 
duty was in fact nothing but to obey what we had been ordered. 
God has ordered that if a pilgrim, who wants to go to Mecca in 
order to carry out the pilgrimage, finds himself impeded -- that 
is, he faces a closed route -- even though he has committed 
himself to the rites by putting on his special hajj attire, he 
is authorized to perform merely the part to do with slaughtering 
sheep, and then remove his hajj attire and return home. He is 
authorized to do the same if, for instance, he becomes ill 
during the pilgrimage. This is Islam's decree. The same decree 
obviously applies to other pilgrimage obligations, such as the 
disavowal of infidels ceremonies. We had no other choice, as we 
did not seek to have caused the violation of the sanctity of the 
holy shrine. 
  This was what I had to say about the disavowal of infidels 
ceremonies. There are, however, numerous issues to do with the 
pilgrimage and the Al Sa'ud government. In sum, one can say 
that it has become the Americans' nest of corruption, in that 
they have brought everything under their control. They have 
imposed their control over political, economic and religious 
issues. 
  On the one hand, they became present in a sacred Islamic 
land. This was unprecedented, as the infidels should not be 
present in that land. However, the Americans came and found a 
foothold there. On the other hand, they invariably interfere in 
different issues. With a single telephone call to Fahd about 
the purchase of passenger planes, Clinton tells him to buy 
Boeing; otherwise, relations are going to be affected. Just by 
this threat, a $6 million aircraft purchase deal is suddenly 
made. Clinton receives his commission from the companies 
concerned, while at the same time about 300,000 jobs are created 
in the American aircraft industry, which is saved from 
bankruptcy for at least several years. This is all done by one 
single telephone call. 
  This is what the situation is like. When we say that Muslims 
should not be abject, this is what we mean. What abjectness can 
be greater that what I just described? What I said merely 
concerned intervention in economic issues. 
  We have, moreover, their intervention in large and small 
issues. I have a guess, which I consider as very close to 
reality, that in respect of the cancellation of the disavowal of 
infidels ceremonies, the support and the insistence of the 
Americans must certainly be taken into account, alongside the 
fact that the Wahhabi clerics and the Al Sa'ud rulers are not 
very keen on the staging of such events anyway. 
  Another issue is that a strange situation has been created 
there, in that a group of Najd clerics, who are in fact the most 
reactionary clerics Islam has seen, seek to impose their ideas, 
with the support of the Saudi leaders, on about 1.2 billion 
Muslims and deprive them of freedom of action. They want 
everyone to follow what they consider as Islam and refrain from 
what they term non-Islamic. This does not follow any logic, 
given what Islam says about the two holy shrines. 
  According to Islam's point of view, these shrines are 
international Islamic centers. [passage omitted] Instead of 
belonging to one single group, these shrines belong to all 
Muslims. If a government rules that land, it should only serve 
the Muslims. It is not authorized to interfere in the way that 
the Muslims fulfill their obligations and perform their rituals 
and worship. That state is there merely to serve Muslims. 
  Despite this Islamic point of view, they prevent Muslims 
from 
performing what in their opinion constitutes a diversion, an 
innovation, and an act of infidelity. This does not only affect 
the Shiites, as the majority of Muslims believe in the principle 
of the blessings which are induced by the act of visiting 
shrines and offering prayers at sacred tombs. They, however, 
oppose all these. This a tragedy, and something must be done 
about it. If these clerics had been anything but extremely 
reactionary and fanatic, then we could have invited them to an 
Islamic congress to discuss these issues in the presence of all 
Islamic scholars. However, they are not prepared to say even 
one word about these issues, as they claim that whatever they 
say is the absolute truth. [passage omitted] 
  The other issue concerns the Saudi leaders' incompetence in 
managing the affairs of the holy shrines. One aspect of this 
concerns safeguarding people's lives. It is not a small matter 
when a pilgrim, who has travelled thousands of kilometers from 
Africa or east Asia to have his one chance of a lifetime to go 
on pilgrimage, is suddenly killed under the crowd stampede. How 
can one justify that? What I saw with my own two eyes smacked of 
mismanagement. Imagine the situation where there are about a 
million people around, half of whom are going towards Jamarat 
while the other half are returning from the site. The two 
crowds suddenly collide, while cars and their escorts are also 
trying to get by. People wonder what they do as they are being 
pushed around. The volume of the crowd naturally causes people 
to fall, and once they fall, they cannot get up, until their 
corpses are evacuated. [passage omitted] 
  What judgment are the people of the world going to pass when 
they witness all these scenes in a center where Islam and its 
culture is manifesting itself? This can be called by no other 
term but mismanagement. 
  Another issue, which is of paramount importance, is the 
widespread corruption of the Saudi ruling class. The whole 
world, except the extremely ignorant, knows that they indulge in 
the most grand debauchery and spend the greatest amount of money 
to satisfy their carnal desires. The scandals are numerous, but 
it is not right for me, as the preacher present at Friday 
prayers sermon premises, to talk about them. I leave these to 
the press. Perhaps when the flow of their money to the Zionist 
press stops, these newspapers will then disclose more of these 
matters. 
  On the basis of these clear issues, one must ask whether 
these people are suitable for managing the affairs of the two 
holy shrines. [passage omitted] 
  It is the pious who should manage the holy shrines. Not 
everyone can take up such a duty. This is the place for the 
pious, for holy Abraham and for worshipping one single God. 
[passage omitted] 
  God, then, ordered Abraham to keep the shrines pure and 
clean. What impurity can be worse than the fact that a number of 
corrupt and profligate individuals, who have built themselves 
places for debauchery and vice all over the world, are ruling 
that sacred land? That is also one such tragedy that we face 
there. 
  Another issue is that of the minorities in Saudi Arabia who 
are mainly Shiite. Some have been expelled from Iraq, and the 
Saudis themselves put them in such a miserable situation. There 
are also Shiites who live in Sharqiyah, living in very bad 
conditions indeed. Extraordinary restrictions are imposed on 
them. They are not allowed to publish or obtain books. Their 
bookshop has been closed down. What kind of logic is it, that a 
group of people are not allowed to write religious books and 
write about their religious duties in order to give them to 
their children to read?. Which part of the world accepts that? 
But, if we make a wrong move -- and sometimes even if we do not 
-- they raise a hue and cry and blow their horns that human 
rights are being violated here, but that it does not matter if 
they are violated there -- even when it concern a cultural or 
religious issue. 
  The minorities cannot establish a seminary; they are not 
allowed to build a mosque; they are not allowed to have a 
bookshop. Those are some of the ugly and shameful restrictions 
imposed on cultural and religious matters. What can be done? 
Why do they behave so badly towards them? What is the offense 
of those refugees? Some of those refugees who are seeking 
asylum are told they should become a Wahhabi first. 
  The first condition is that a person should become a Wahhabi 
before seeking asylum. Where in the world could you find such 
words or the imposition of such ideas, such weak-minded ideas? 
But the world has shut up because Saudi Arabia is where the 
dollar is and is the center of oil money, and it is giving it 
away to shut them up. Therefore, to the West, everything Saudi 
Arabia does conforms to human rights. 
  Another issue, which constitutes my final remarks in this 
sermon, is the speech of Fahd on 'Id al-'Adha this year. Each 
year heads of various pilgrimage groups from different countries 
are invited to go and see Fahd on the occasion of 'Id al-Adha. 
This was done very simply in previous years and nothing was 
mentioned. But this year, all of a sudden, his excellency made 
a long speech, which newspapers also reported, on various issues 
and services in Medina and Mecca. One part of the speech was 
about the services and another dealt with political issues in 
Somalia, Afghanistan, Bosnia-Herzegovina and also one part was 
about Iran. 
  On the issue of Iran, he mentioned the issue of the three 
islands and said that Iran should observe international 
agreements and human rights and so on. Very well, our first 
question is: you have always condemned us and placed a cordon 
around us saying that political issues should not be raised here 
during the pilgrimage. What was your speech about then? Was it 
not a political speech? Why are you raising political issues? 
[passage omitted] 
  Then on the Iranian affairs, always when those Saudi 
gentlemen are under pressure, in order to make a payoff to their 
masters, they immediately raise certain issues headed by the 
issue of the three islands. They think when they say a few 
words then all problems are solved. They themselves know that 
the issue of the islands is nothing that could be solved with a 
speech or a statement. Basically there is no problem to be 
solved. They are stirring trouble. They want to blackmail us. 
They want to blackmail us that if you do not do this or that, 
then we will raise the issue of the three islands. That is the 
issue; otherwise, the UAE itself is not so persistent on this 
and they themselves are perhaps conscious that we are right. 
But the Saudis are stirring up trouble. They have become the 
region's agent provocateur now. They bully Yemen, they bully 
Qatar, they bully the UAE, and they also intend to bully us. 
  In any case, those are some of the issues, and we hope that 
one day a pious government rules that holy land so that the 
Muslim people who go to holy Mecca could perform their religious 
duties as God wishes. [crowd chants: "God is great," "Death to 
America," "Death to Israel]

<F P=106> [Second Friday prayers sermon by Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, </F>
member of the Council of Guardians and acting Friday prayers 
leader, in Tehran on 10 June -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The esteemed leader has 
recently issued orders that financial corruption in the 
administrative organization should be dealt with. It is a clear 
command. He has issued orders to one powerful organization 
about discovery and information, and has given orders to a 
powerful judicial organization about judgement and legal 
investigation. God willing, I hope those two organizations act 
strongly, as the leader wishes. 
  That is one of our fundamental problems. It is one of the 
deep-rooted evil deeds which I am talking about, this financial 
corruption in the administrative organization. It has crippled, 
really crippled, many areas. Once it is dealt with we hope that 
that corruption is eradicated. [passage omitted] 
  And let me offer my thanks here for the matter of price 
tagging which they have carried out. It is a very good thing 
that has been done. But several points must be considered. One 
is that it should be pursued. It should not be mere words and 
then disappear; it should not be for one or two months but for 
always. The officials carrying out the policy as well as the 
judiciary system should take the matter seriously. That is most 
necessary. 
  Another is that they should not busy themselves with trivial 
issues. If, for instance, a barrowman sells potatoes at 5 rials 
more expensive than the rate, they should not harass him, just 
like the former chamber of trades, and just deal with those poor 
street vendors. They should trap the big overchargers and bring 
them to book. Dealing with trivial matters dissipates the 
forces. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by 'Ali Feyz: "The Pricing Plan"] </F>
  [Text] Putting price labels on consumer goods has become 
compulsory. But apparently both the sellers and the buyers 
doubt the positive impact of this plan; and the question is why? 
The initial impression was that at least the buyers would have 
welcomed this plan, which would at least clear up matters. But 
this is not what happened. The sellers also have their specific 
reasons for considering this plan impractical and temporary. In 
order to explain these stances, we should consider the 
psychology of Iranian society. This society has learned that 
there is no stability in decision-makings and that such acts are 
more of a propaganda nature rather than facts. Therefore, both 
the buyers and the sellers consider this plan to be temporary; 
and if the government makes them observe the tagging of goods, 
both sides will continue to be careless. 
  Moreover, the pricing policy and tagging is facing a more 
serious problem. Prices cannot be kept low artificially. An 
economy based on a free market follows specific laws. Profit is 
the main factor in the market and something which cannot 
tolerate any laws or limitations. And each time the government 
exerts pressures from the outside, goods are very easily moved 
underground and under-the-table deals are made. And this 
situation, which is known as black marketeering, will thrive in 
Iran. It is surprising how this policy has been tested so many 
times and proven to be insufficient, yet it is not given up. 
Iran's business economy is not in a situation where it can be 
controlled. Part of the well-off society in Iran wants to show 
off. The purchasing power of these so-called nouveaux-riches is 
so high that the black market business cannot fail to thrive. 
It is not a secret to anyone that there is a shortage of goods 
in many fields. Therefore, the more goods that are taken 
underground, the higher their prices and the demand for them 
will be. In such a situation how can one hope that the pricing 
plan and the tagging of goods will be successful? 
  The fact that the existing high prices of goods and services 
have roots that go deeper than mere profiteering should not be 
ignored. The production of many goods is not as high as demand, 
and imports are facing many fluctuations because of the great 
problems with foreign exchange. It is because of this that 
fluctuations in the foreign exchange rates immediately affect 
prices. If we consider that the tagging of goods as the 
government intends will work, each salesman will have to sit 
down and watch how the dollar rate is fluctuating. Is this 
really possible?! It is quite doubtful. As long as the 
necessary balance between production and consumption or between 
the shortage of goods and imports is absent, no pricing policy 
will help to stabilize prices. We have experienced this several 
times in the past. This time too, we are experimenting with 
this unsuccessful experience. 
  The very fact that both the buyers and the sellers have not 
taken this plan seriously automatically shows that there is lack 
of confidence in it. And since this is the case, it is 
surprising that a pricing policy which both sides looked on with 
mistrust has been adopted. We think that this policy does not 
conform with the true economic conditions in the country and is 
nothing more than a temporary measure. But if it turn out the 
opposite, then we should say that something is very wrong in 
society, and this will be an exception that cannot be explained 
by any economic criterion. At any rate, these comments should 
not be interpreted as a saying that pricing is completely 
useless. The issue is one of economic realities, in which 
pricing is one of the various outcomes of production and is 
completely different from political decision- making.

  [Text] The AICC [All-India Congress Committee] session 
unanimously adopted the economic resolution here tonight after 
senior ministers handling core economic subjects told the 
members that the reforms underway are meant to make India strong 
so that it could stand on its own feet. 
  Urging the members not to be misled by the vicious 
opposition 
propaganda about the Government's new economic policies, Finance 
Minister Manmohan Singh and Commerce Minister Pranab Mukheriee 
maintained that the country's economic sovereignty would not be 
compromised at any cost. 
  Interestingly, former Union Mimster N. D. Tiwari moved the 
economic resolution, which was seconded by Mr Mukherjee. Mr 
Tiwari emphasised that the economic reforms were meant to 
overcome challenges of the future particularly in the 21st 
century. 
  Mr Tiwari said the economic reforms were not for improving 
the stock markets and the like but to give a push to socio 
economic policies envisaged by Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Lal Bahadur 
Shastri and Rajiv Gandhi. He had no doubt that India would be 
one of the big powers in the 21st century. "We will ensure that 
nobody can dictate to us." 
  Mr Tiwari said one must be realistic about where the world 
was heading and these reforms were necessary for allround 
development and the uplift of the poor. In this context, he said 
China was also looking outwards and wanting to become a member 
of GATT as also Vietnam and Fidel Castro's Cuba. 
  Mr Mukherjee attacked the Opposition accusing it of 
spreading 
misconception. Stoutly defending the Centre's decision to 
initiate steps to attract more foreign direct investment, he 
said these were required for higher growth. 
  "Our economic reforms are not a pipe-dream", Mr Mukherjee 
said and lauded the middle path adopted by his Government. 
  Dr Manmohan Singh made it clear that the Government was 
providing all possible encouragement to the public sector. He 
said they wanted the public sector to be profitable because 
these could be ploughed for the benefit of poorer sections in 
the rural areas. 
  Dr Singh said the Government was committed not to retrench 
public sector employees while restructuring PSUs [public sector 
units]. 
  "We will not allow the Indian working class to suffer." 
  Agriculture Minister Balram Jakhar charged the BJP with 
misleading the farmers on the GATT agreement even though the 
Opposition did not know about all the existing varieties of 
seeds.

  [Text] The All Indian Congress Committee (AICC) on Friday 
dismissed criticism of its economic polic of inviting foreign 
investment and congratulated the Government for reviving the 
"sick economy" it had inherited from the non-Congress 
governments in 1991. 
  The resolution which was introduced by Mr Narain Dutt Tewari 
and seconded by Commerce Minisster Pranab Mukherjee, praised the 
Narasimha Rao Government for carrying on the policies of Rajiv 
Gandhi under the overall perspective chalked out by late 
Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi. 
  It condemned the "baseless, mischievous and malicious 
propaganda launched by non-Congress parties against India's 
signing of the GATT agreement. It said it recognised the 
benefits that the country would get from the multilateral, 
rule-based trading system. "A multilateral system which is based 
on negotiations and flexibility is better for a country like 
India." 
  Observing that the public sector was extremely useful for 
the 
economy, the resolution said "the public sector will, however 
have to become profitable. Such obligations are best met when 
public enterprises make profits, not losses." 
  In a highly self-congratulatory tone it noted that India was 
the only country in the world that had recorded positive growth 
rates in the first three years of its reforms-cum-fiscal 
correction programme. It urged the Government to effectively 
deal with the problems confronting urban India and said the time 
has come to look at rural and urban development not separately 
but as interlinked phenomena. 
  Later, intervening in the debate, Finance Minister Manmohan 
Singh said a lot of funds from the non-resident Indians and 
foreign investments had come in due to the new economic policy 
being pursued by the Centre. This would boost production and 
generate employment, taking India towards progress and 
self-reliance, Dr Singh said while rounding up the discussion on 
the economic resolution. 
  Earlier Mr Mukherjee said the Centre's policy was to attract 
direct foreign investments for higher growth and instead of 
depending on borrowings alone. 
  However, the foreign investment would come "on our terms and 
in areas we consider essential", he said.

  [Text] India is taking steps to allay US concerns over the 
lack of adequate intellectual property rights (IPR) protections, 
according to Naresh Chandra, senior adviser to the Prime 
Minister and former Cabinet Secretary. 
  Giving the keynote speech at the beginning of a two-day 
seminar on "Technology transfer and other joint venture 
opportunities in the new India" here, Mr Chandra noted the 
hurdles created in many sensitive areas while concluding 
agreements on transfer of technology between the two countries. 
  "Strong opinions have been expressed from both sides and the 
provisions in the GATT agreement pertaining to the patent system 
have caused acrimonious debate," conceded Mr Chandra at the 
meeting which was organised by Business Development Associates. 
  However, consequent to the agreement signed on December 15 
last year in Marrakech, "India will be introducing necessary 
amendments to the Indian Patent Act of 1970," Mr Chandra said, 
echoing the Prime Minister's assurances to US Commerce Secretary 
Ron Brown and US Trade Representative (USTR) Mickey Kantor. 
  A little over a month ago, India, along with China and 
Argentina, got a reprieve of 60 days from the USTR to improve 
its patent and copyright laws. Otherwise, it was in danger of 
being listed as a Special 301 country, one that was not meeting 
the conditions of trade laid down in the US Trade Act. 
  The Patent Act amendment, Mr Chandra said, would increase 
the 
period of protection from seven years to 14 years in the case of 
pharmaceuticals and processed foods and 20 years in other cases. 
  He stressed that New Delhi had traditionally been cognisant 
of the need to protect IPR, a view strongly disputed by 
Washington's senior officials. 
  The Copyright Act was also being amended for the protection 
of performers, sound recorders and broadcasting organisations. 
Furthermore, trade marks, trade secrets and industrial designs 
were protected under laws conforming to international standards, 
Mr Chandra insisted. 
  "Apprehensions with regard to protection of IPR and 
infringements of patents and copyright have been exaggerated in 
the past," he said. 
  N Vittal, Secretary, Telecommunications, was also invited to 
the meetings, but was unable to attend because of preoccupations.

  [Text] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has reiterated that 
Pakistan intends to highlight the Kashmir issue at the 
international level, but it will keep the doors open for 
bilateral negotiations to resolve the issue. 
  In an interview with the Dubayy daily KHALEEJ TIMES, she 
referred to the changes in the global scenario, saying things 
that seemed impossible in the Middle East, South Africa, 
Cambodia, and Somalia have now become possible. She said 
Pakistan and India cannot remain passive and allow this region 
to be a center of tension. Referring to her efforts to find a 
solution to the issue, she said that by expressing its 
willingness to hold the foreign secretary-level talks that took 
place in Islamabad, Pakistan paved the way for negotiations. 
This demonstrates our determination to solve this problem on a 
bilateral basis. She said, however, that Pakistan does not want 
to make bilateral talks an excuse for crushing the Kashmiris. 
Benazir Bhutto said Pakistan has made several other proposals, 
such as a reduction of forces in Jammu and Kashmir; the 
abrogation of barbaric legislation in the occupied valley; the 
release of the Hurriat Conference leaders; and permission for 
human rights groups, the international mass media, and diplomats 
to visit Kashmir. 
  Answering a question, she said another extremely important 
element of Pakistan's foreign policy is improving its relations 
with the United States through meaningful talks. The prime 
minister said Pakistan does not want these relations to be 
limited to the single aspect of the nuclear issue; we want to 
make these relations multidimensional. Referring to the 
Pressler law, she said Pakistan does not have a nuclear weapon 
and has demonstrated a great deal of perseverance and restraint 
by refraining from detonating a nuclear explosion. Pakistan has 
decided not to exceed the existing limits unless its existence 
is threatened. Thus, from a legal point of view, Pakistan has 
not violated the Pressler law. She said this law has assumed 
the form of a veto that is in India's hands. Benazir Bhutto said 
Pakistan welcomes the Clinton administration's policy of 
controlling, reducing, and eliminating nuclear programs at the 
regional level. On the issue of the F-16 aircraft, she said 
Pakistan should receive these aircraft because it was a 
commercial deal and Pakistan has already paid for them. 
Pakistan should get the F-16's or the money should be refunded.

  [Text] Rawalpindi -- President Farooq Leghari said Monday 
that Prithvi is country-specific to Pakistan like the Pressler 
Amendment and even more alarming is India's missile programme. 
  Addressing the convocation of the National Defence College 
(NDC), Leghari said: "The Agni threatens a vast region, from 
China and south East Asia to Kazakhstan, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. 
India's acquisition of cryogenic engines provides it a licence 
to acquire ICBM [Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile] 
capability. Other countries of the region cannot sit back 
complacently while India acquires a potential stanglehold over 
them." 
  He said: "It was not enough for us to be told that India 
will 
promise not to deploy Prithivis. How long does it take to 
actually deploy those mobile launched missiles, 12 hours, 24 
hours?. 
  "Our region must be saved from a missile race. Unless we 
settle for a zero-missile regime in the region, the race will 
become inevitable. The US and Russia must act positively now 
and restrain India," he demanded. 
  Leghari said: "In response to our security imperatives, we 
also seek self-reliance and indigenisation in our country in 
general and defence production in particular. Import of high 
tech equipment from abroad is not only a heavy drain on our 
economy, but also subjects us to a high degree of uncertainty." 
  "We have learnt that no nation can expect to be truly 
sovereign if it is totally dependent on others for import of 
arms and technology. 
  The President urged that Pakistan must plan its 
indigenisation effort with vision and follow it with the resolve 
to stand on its own feet as early as possible.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "America's Half-Hearted Reaction"] </F>
  [Text] Pakistan has described the U.S. reaction to the 
Indian Prithvi missile test as half-hearted and said that this 
action will encourage India to extend the missile race in South 
Asia. The United States asked Pakistan and India last year to 
stop the manufacture, acquisition, and testing of missiles in 
South Asia. Pakistan accepted the U.S. advice, but India did not 
respond. The issue was once again raised when Strobe Talbott, 
the U.S. deputy secretary of state, visited the region in April. 
  India then postponed the Prithvi missile test just before 
Narasimha Rao's visit to the United States. However, as soon as 
Rao concluded the visit, India test fired the missile and made 
it clear to the whole world, including the United States, that 
it is free to deal with its own matters without regard to the 
advice of the United States or any other country. The U.S. 
reaction to India's attitude is not only half-hearted, but also 
superfluous. As far as Pakistan's nuclear program is concerned, 
it has been clearly pointed out to the United States that 
Pakistan will not accept any unilateral decision in this regard. 
Amazingly, India pays no attention to U.S. advice, nor does it 
care about world public opinion on the nuclear issue or on 
missile production. This arrogance is leading to a lack of 
balance of power and is causing concern and apprehension among 
the smaller countries in the region.

  [Text] Responding to a question regarding a news report 
published in a local English daily alleging the expulsion of two 
Pakistani diplomats from Germany, a Foreign Office spokesman 
said in Islamabad today that the report by German television was 
factually incorrect. No Pakistani diplomat has been expelled 
from Germany as asserted in the report. The spokesman said 
Pakistan is procuring a number of sophisticated items of [as 
heard] equipment from various sources. Normally, it is for 
supplier companies to obtain export license for restricted 
items. For its part, Pakistan seeks to scrupulously observe the 
export laws of the concerned countries. He said the report 
appears to be an attempt to sensationalize normal transactions.

  [Text] The Haifa newspaper AL-ITTIHAD quotes a senior PLO 
source as saying that efforts are under way in several Arab 
capitals to bring Yasir 'Arafat to Jericho accompanied by 
Egyptian President Mubarak, King Hassan of Morocco, and Jordan's 
King Husayn. The source noted that this is apparently the 
reason for the delay in 'Arafat's arrival to the autonomous 
areas. Our correspondent Qaysar Kabaha reports that according 
to the PLO source, if 'Arafat arrives with these three leaders, 
the problem of his visit to Jerusalem would also be solved. The 
source added that 'Arafat is not interested in arriving in 
Jericho during the world soccer championships because these 
games will captivate worldwide attention.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Ehud Ya'ari] </F>
  [Text] Sources in Tunis told us this evening that there is 
a delay and that Yasir 'Arafat will not arrive in the autonomous 
areas before the end of the month, perhaps not until mid-July. 
  'Arafat will not come alone. It now appears that two weeks 
ago the PLO submitted to Israel a list of 600 senior PLO 
activists, officials, and officers from Tunis in order to obtain 
approval for their arrival in Gaza and Jericho. Another list of 
600 names is on its way. Altogether some 1,200 men and their 
families will arrive. Contrary to 'Arafat's original plan, his 
new move calls for moving most of the PLO bodies from Tunis to 
the territories. Only the foreign relations offices of Faruq 
Qaddumi and Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas] will remain in Tunis along 
with several other branches. These offices will constitute a 
powerful rear headquarters. 'Arafat will also keep his 
residence in (Yugorta) Street. 
  The practical meaning of 'Arafat's move is the elimination 
-- 
at least on the face of it -- of PLO-Tunis and replanting it 
among the higher echelons of the PLO in the territories. 
'Arafat has apparently decided not to keep too many 
institutions in Tunis over and above the autonomy institutions. 
One of the reasons for this is that he has received hints from 
the Tunisian president that it is time for a parting of the ways. 
  Some of the candidates for return have decided to 
temporarily 
leave their families in Amman. Most of them want to live in the 
West Bank rather than in Gaza and Jericho, in which only a 
handful of them can be housed. Israel has not given its 
approval yet, but most of the requests will be approved. 
  The lists include some important surprises. Several Fatah 
officials who were known for their opposition to the Oslo 
agreement want to come with 'Arafat. 
  Others, such as 'Abbas Zaki and Hani al-Hasan, are still 
undecided. In the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine 
and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine there 
are signs of a split. Some 40 activists from the organization 
of George Habash -- a firm opponent of the agreement -- want to 
arrive with 'Arafat. Among them are (Abu-Nidal Musalmah), a 
veteran official in charge of secret activities in the 
territories, and 'Abd-al-Rahim Malluh, a member of the PLO 
Executive Committee. One of the two may join the Palestinian 
Authority. A similar phenomenon can be noticed in Nayif 
Hawatimah's organization, where some 20 activists are included 
in the lists of those wanting to return, among them Taysir 
Khalid, a member of the PLO Executive Committee. At the present 
time all of the above will apparently be allowed to return for 
only a visit. 
  The list, which is on its way to Israel, includes 
approximately 300 Fatah fighters from Tyre and Sidon who are 
awaiting the order to leave Lebanon and come to Gaza.

<F P=106> [Report by Rashid Khashanah: "'Arafat Orders Closure of </F>
Military Offices in Tunisia; Transfer of Cadres Awaits Israeli 
Approval"] 
  [Text] Tunis -- A senior PLO official has told AL-HAYAH 
that the decision issued by President 'Arafat yesterday ordering 
the closure of the Palestinian offices in Tunisia 15 June 
especially covered the military offices attached to the 
commander in chief and did not apply to the PLO departments and 
offices in Tunisia. 
  The official, who declined to reveal his identity, said that 
the PLO's main military offices were in Hammam al-Shatt suburb 
(16 km south of the capital, Tunis). These offices were the 
target of an Israeli raid 2 October 1985. He put the number of 
these offices at about 50, concerned with the mobilization, 
guidance, command, and military security of the Palestinian 
forces scattered throughout nine Arab countries. 
  He stressed that the closure of these offices, including the 
office of the commander in chief, was also in implementation of 
another decision made by President 'Arafat, who is also the 
commander in chief of the Palestinian revolution's forces, 
stipulating that no official or cadre should remain in the 
military offices in Tunisia after 1 July. 
  It has been noticed in PLO offices and departments that 
preparations are underway for the departure from Tunisia to the 
autonomy areas. The Palestinians have begun selling their 
furniture and motor vehicles, but no decision has been issued 
for the closure of civilian departments and offices, and there 
is no clear date for the cadres and employees in PLO departments 
to leave Tunisia. The general feeling, however, is that they 
will not remain in Tunisia after the end of July. 
  Meanwhile, a highly placed Fatah source has stated that the 
Organization and Mobilization Office run by [Fatah] Central 
Committee Member Muhammad Ghunaym (Abu-Mahir), the Ideological 
Mobilization Office run by Central Committee Member Sakhr Habash 
(Abu-Nizar), and the Office of Fatah's Revolutionary Council run 
by Hamdan 'Ashur, will remain in Tunisia until the end of this 
current year at least. That is in addition to the PLO 
departments which, it has been decided, will remain abroad. The 
most important of these departments are the Political 
Department, the Returnees Department, and the Arab and 
International Relations Department headed by Mahmud 'Abbas 
(Abu-Mazin). 
  Furthermore, AL-HAYAH has learned that the PLO has prepared 
a 
new name list of 1,000 people working in Palestinian offices and 
departments, mostly in Tunisia, to be submitted to Israel for 
approval of their entry to the autonomy areas. An official who 
participated in preparing that list said that it would not be 
handed over before approval is received from Israel for the 
first list of 601 officials and cadres who will accompany 
President 'Arafat on his journey to Jericho which was handed 
over recently by the PLO. He added that the new list contains 
information identical to that contained in the first list: full 
name, place of birth, office of work, and type of travel 
document held. 
  Palestinian sources have confirmed that President 'Arafat's 
move to Jericho has been postponed further, until the beginning 
of next month at the earliest. They said that Palestinian and 
Arab figures, including Muhsin Ibrahim, who recently came to 
Tunis to accompany President 'Arafat on his return journey, have 
now left there following the second postponement.

<F P=106> [By Marius Schattner] </F>
  [Text] Jerusalem, June 14 (AFP) -- The Palestinians are 
laying on a state presidential welcome for PLO chairman Yasir 
'Arafat's return with 5,000 men assigned to security and 
logistics of the visit. 
  "We will need a minimum of 1,200 policemen and civilians in 
Jericho and three times as many in Gaza to protect Yasir 'Arafat 
and look after the logistics," one of Palestinian protocol 
officers told AFP. 
  "We are expecting that a quarter of a million Palestinians 
will come to Jericho to celebrate the return home of the 
president of Palestine," he said. "So many people will be a real 
headache for us." 
  Such an influx into the small Jordan valley town, with only 
one road in and out, will make it virtually impossible for 
'Arafat to move around. 
  Jericho, where summer temperatures hover around 40 degrees 
Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), has two main streets and a little 
square. 
  "We are faced with a dilemma: if we restrict entry we will 
spoil the day, if we let everyone in there will be a terrible 
crush," said the official, who asked not to be named. 
  The risk of an attempt on 'Arafat's life cannot be neglected 
either. 
  "An Israeli settler or even a Palestinian opposed to the 
peace process could take advantage of the confusion to try to 
kill him," he said, recalling threats from Jewish extremists. 
  The pro-Syrian Palestinian leader Ahmad Jibril has also 
called for 'Arafat to be killed following his signing of the 
autonomy agreement last September. 
  The official said 'Arafat should arrive in Jericho by 
helicopter, thereby avoiding the Israeli checkpoint on the 
Allenby Bridge from Jordan. 
  He would also fly to the Gaza Strip because a land journey 
would mean an Israeli army escort. 
  Questions of protocol are greatly exercising the organizers 
who plan to invite the nine consul generals and the Vatican's 
apostolic delegate in Jerusalem as well as a certain number of 
ambassadors based in Tel Aviv. 
  "All this is new to us," the official admitted. "How do we 
bring them to Jericho? How do we seat them? How do we greet 
them.?" 
  None of the countries they represent have recognized 'Arafat 
as the head of the State of Palestine. 
  'Arafat has given a written commitment to Israel not to use 
the title of president following the signing of the May 4 accord 
which launched self-rule in Jericho and Gaza. 
  "That does not change anything for the Palestinians," said 
Ma'in 'Urayqat, spokesman for Orient House, the Palestinian 
headquarters in Jerusalem. "We will roll out the red carpet for 
Yasir 'Arafat and receive him as head of State." 
  "The arrival of the PLO leader will give a strong boost to 
the peace process," 'Urayqat said. "It is in the interest of all 
the concerned parties that it goes off well. That means the 
Israelis must avoid any provocation by settlers or soldiers 
which would harm the political climate." 
  For the last four weeks, the head of 'Arafat's bureau, Ramzi 
Khuri, has been here working out the details of the visit. 
  He has chosen a luxury home and offices for the PLO chairman 
in lush green compound on the edge of Jericho. 
  The Palestinian cabinet of "ministers" will be housed in a 
new building which was to have been an old people's home and 
individual ministers have been alloted houses throughout Jericho. 
  In Gaza, the former Egyptian governor's palace, which Israel 
used as a border police headquarters, is being restored for 
'Arafat. He will also have a private residence at his 
disposition in the wealthy Rimal neighbourhood overlooking the 
Mediterranean Sea. 
  "He is not coming as a tourist but to start up the mechanism 
of autonomy," a Palestinian official said. 
  The arrival is scheduled for the end of June or early July.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Samir Ghawshah, member of the </F>
Palestinian National Authority and the PLO Executive Committee, 
in Tunis by Fawzi al-Jundi in Cairo; date not given; from the 
"Dialogue from Afar" program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Jundi] Dr. Samir Ghawshah, what is the status of 
the preparations for the Palestinian National Authority [PNA] to 
assume its duties in Gaza and Jericho and for President Yasir 
'Arafat's arrival in the self-rule areas? 
  [Ghawshah] Preparations are continuing for the arrival of 
brother Abu-'Ammar and members of the Palestinian leadership and 
PNA in the homeland in the Jericho area and the Gaza Strip to 
assume their duties, embark on a new phase in the reconstruction 
process, and continue the negotiations for Israel's withdrawal 
from all the Palestinian territories occupied in 1967, including 
the city of Jerusalem. We hope that the Palestinian leaders 
will arrive in the homeland in the next few days. 
  [Al-Jundi] Have enough security measures been taken to 
ensure 
Abu-'Ammar's arrival in the self-rule areas, especially 
following recent threats by Israeli elements? 
  [Ghawshah] We believe that these statements aim to create 
confusion and to prevent implementation of the agreement. But 
we are confident that our people will foil all the settlers' 
attempts to disrupt the implementation of the agreement. The 
PLO, backed by our people, will undoubtedly put an end to all 
the plots and the plans to endanger the lives of our people and 
leaders. 
  [Al-Jundi] The issue of Palestinian establishments in 
Jerusalem has recently been raised. Is there is an intention to 
let these establishments continue their work or will they be 
moved to the Palestinian self-rule area in Gaza and Jericho? 
  [Ghawshah] The whole world, including the United Nations and 
international legitimacy, have issued several resolutions 
stressing that Jerusalem is part of the Palestinian and Arab 
territories occupied during the June 1967 war. Therefore, we 
are holding on to all our national establishments in Jerusalem. 
On the other hand, we believe that the Declaration of 
Principles agreement has stipulated that no changes or 
alterations should be made on the status of Jerusalem and that 
this issue will be discussed when the negotiations over the 
final phase begin. 
  [Al-Jundi] It was recently announced that secret talks were 
held between Palestinian and Israeli officials on the Jerusalem 
issue. How true are these reports? 
  [Ghawshah] I have no information about any secret talks. Our 
stance on Jerusalem is firm and well-known, namely that it is 
part of the Palestinian territories occupied in 1967. 
  [Al-Jundi] The development process in the Gaza Strip and 
Jericho undoubtedly requires a serious commitment from the donor 
countries. The Palestinian side expressed satisfaction with the 
recent meeting in Paris of the committee coordinating aid to the 
Palestinians. 
  [Ghawshah] The aid and support we are talking about is 
partial because the reality facing us is this: Our homeland was 
occupied by Israel for 27 years during which the infrastructure 
was completely destroyed, its economy damaged, and its 
establishments hit. Therefore, we regard any aid to be partial. 
Of course, we are grateful to all those who have given aid, 
regardless of the amount. But this is just the beginning and it 
is part of much bigger needs. Our people's efforts and resources 
will provide the major share of what we need. We believe that 
the partial aid given so far is necessary for beginning our 
work. But we stress that these sums are not enough. Therefore, 
all Palestinian resources must be mobilized while welcoming 
every Arab and international effort and backing to continue the 
process of establishing our national authority toward the goal 
of creating our Palestinian independent state with Jerusalem as 
its capital. 
  [Al-Jundi] Is there a specific strategy for Palestinian 
action in the coming stage on the comprehensive development 
process that the Palestinian self-rule area in Gaza and Jericho 
requires? 
  [Ghawshah] The PNA members are preparing a draft plan on all 
the requirements of the development process to mobilize all 
resources and intensify all efforts to carry out a correct and 
sound building process and exploit every cent in the right way 
to alleviate our people's pain and build our homeland. 
  [Al-Jundi] Dr. Samir Ghawshah, thank you from the Voice of 
the Arabs. 
  [Ghawshah] You are welcome.

<F P=106> [Report by Sophia 'Amarah in Cairo] </F>
  [Text] Cairo today bid farewell to a member of the 
Palestinian National Authority [PNA] formed to administer the 
Palestinian autonomous areas. 
  Dr. Nabil Sha'th, who will be accompanied by Monte Carlo 
radio in the car that will take him from the Egyptian capital to 
his homeland -- where he will settle in Gaza, held a news 
conference in the Cairo this morning prior to his departure. 
  [Begin recording] ['Amarah] Dr. Nabil Sha'th: Let us brush 
aside the issue of your return home. What are the major 
difficulties that you will confront at the start of your new 
mission in Gaza? 
  [Sha'th] Our major difficulty will be with Israel. It lies 
in the implementation of the agreement signed with the Israelis, 
and the continuation of the negotiations, as provided for in the 
Declaration of Principles. There are still many issues that we 
and the Israelis need to work out and agree upon, including the 
release of all prisoners, the opening of a safe corridor between 
Gaza and Jericho, bringing the West Bank under the PNA's 
authority, and the repatriation of the persons displaced in 
1967. We must immediately begin efforts to settle these issues, 
which were obscured by the Israeli [words indistinct]. 
Moreover, we must confront any problems the Israelis might 
create over Jerusalem. 
  ['Amarah] Dr. Nabil Sha'th has also announced that 
Palestinian border guards will soon be deployed on the Allenby 
Bridge and the Rafah Border Post. He added that the 
Palestinians will shortly be allowed to move freely from the 
Gaza Strip to the Jericho area. 
  With regard to the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, 
Sha'th 
had the following to say: 
  [Sha'th] We will not allow people bearing arms to move 
freely 
on the street. However, we will not storm houses to seize 
weapons. As we once fought the Israelis, we will not now allow 
the Israelis to move freely with their weapons on streets and 
roads, and to use them to open fire on the Palestinians. In the 
same vein, we will not allow the Palestinians to open fire on 
the Israelis. We will not allow any of us to turn into a judge, 
indictor, prosecutor, and executioner. We will not allow this 
to happen. There might be some collaborators with the 
occupation authorities. Those who have any complaints in this 
regard must head for the Palestinian police, provide evidence, 
and demand a trial of those suspected of collaboration. If 
everybody acts conscientiously and out of a sense of 
responsibility; that is, if everybody believes in Islam, in 
their leaders, in a constitution, and a host of principles, then 
he or she must grant officials and leaders the opportunity to 
continue the struggle in its various forms in light of what is 
deemed appropriate by the current phase, taking into account 
what the Muslim community deems best. I believe that the 
Palestinian people now have the opportunity to achieve their 
goals. If we were to fail in this, then nobody would blame us 
if we return to armed struggle. 
  ['Amarah] On the other hand, Sha'th announced that 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat will arrive in the 
autonomous areas next week to reside in Jericho. 
  In a related development, the Palestinian official affirmed 
that the PNA, which pledged to donor nations to achieve 
self-reliance within a year's time, is awaiting international 
aid modelled on the Marshal plan launched by the United States 
to aid the collapsing West European states in the wake of World 
War II, rather than a redemption operation similar to that of 
redeeming ruptured [word indistinct], as he put it. We will 
update you on relevant developments once we arrive in Gaza 
Strip. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Faysal al-Husayni, member of the Palestinian </F>
National Authority, by Sa'id Mu'addi; place and date not given; 
from the "With The Midday Events" program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] Mr. Faysal al-Husayni: The families of 
Palestinian detainees and prisoners are staging protest marches. 
What are you doing as a Palestinian leadership? 
  [Al-Husayni] In fact, we are facing a problem over the 
interpretation of the agreement that was signed in Gaza, as well 
as the agreement that was signed in Cairo first and then in 
Gaza. Our view of this agreement is that 5,000 Palestinian 
prisoners should be released before 11 June and that all 
Palestinian detainees should return home, except those involved 
in criminal cases -- murders or ordinary criminal cases; those 
should be turned over to the Palestinian Authority. We were 
surprised that the Israelis interpreted this as meaning that he 
who killed a [Israeli] civilian is covered by this formula. 
They then came back to add that he who injured a [Israeli] 
civilian is covered by that formula even if he was tried at a 
military court. We now want to have, once again, a distinction; 
that what we were talking about was the criminal aspects and not 
the military cases, which, as is well known, had reasons 
connected to the confrontation with the occupation and ended 
with the signing of the peace process and should not remain 
unresolved. 
  As regards the other prisoners, negotiations on their 
release 
must start immediately after 11 June. Now because of this 
Israeli position, we demanded an end to the prisoner release 
according to the Israeli way. The prisoners should be released 
according to our concept, or a new agreement must be drafted 
with the Israelis on the way the prisoners should be released. 
We and the prisoners will be facing major complications if we 
accept the Israeli concept. 
  What I would like to clarify here for our brother prisoners 
is that their cause is one of our priorities. We insist that in 
the end all Palestinian prisoners must be released and returned 
home. This is a peace process and within this context -- the 
peace process -- all Palestinians must be released regardless of 
the acts they committed. 
  [Mu'addi] Mr. Faysal, the security liaison committee will 
meet today in Gaza to discuss this issue. Are there any 
proposals on the agenda? 
  [Al-Husayni] Yes. We are supposed to raise at this meeting 
the issue which we are facing in Jericho. A large number of 
Palestinians who were released should return to their homes 
immediately. The formula agreed upon in the past -- that is; 
he who killed a Palestinian must remain in Jericho -- means 
that he should remain in Jericho only if his leaving to his 
place of residence would cause problems. But if his leaving to 
his place of residence does not create anything that may harm 
the security of that person, then he must return to his home. 
Those who were arrested for wounding or harming others, these 
must return immediately, even if this is done gradually, but 
they must return because their cases are resolved. 
  [Mu'addi] Mr. Husayni, how many prisoners have been released 
so far on the basis of the Cairo agreement? 
  [Al-Husayni] So far, less than half the number have been 
released, that is less than 2,500 prisoners. Some 300 prisoners 
are now in Jericho, and at least half of them must go 
immediately to their homes. 
  [Mu'addi] Mr. Faysal al-Husayni, naturally you are now 
making arrangements in preparations for Yasir 'Arafat's arrival 
in the self-rule area. Has 'Arafat informed you of the date of 
his arrival and have you informed the Israeli authorities of 
'Arafat's date of arrival? 
  [Al-Husayni] I can say that it will be in the second half of 
this month, not before 15 June. 
  [Mu'addi] Mr. Faysal al-Husayni, thank you. 
  [Al-Husayni] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Shlomi Eldar] </F>
  [Excerpts] The issue of the Palestinian prisoners is 
turning into the central issue in the territories in 
anticipation of Yasir 'Arafat's arrival. Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] and the rejectionist organizations are 
calling for mass demonstrations in the Gaza Strip to protest the 
delay in the release of the prisoners. A leaflet distributed 
today says that the terrorist Rabin -- as the leaflet depicts 
him -- cannot be expected to release the prisoners. Almost 300 
prisoners who according to the Oslo agreement must remain in the 
autonomous area are grounded in Jericho at the present time. Our 
correspondent Shlomi Eldar reports: 
  [Begin Eldar recording] The pressure being exerted by the 
families of the Palestinians behind bars imprisoned in Israeli 
prisons is growing. In a mass demonstration organized by George 
Habash's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Habash's 
picture was hoisted alongside that of thousands of prisoners. 
So far Israel has released less than one half of the security 
prisoners it promised to release, and this issue tops all other 
issues on Gaza's public agenda. This pressure has reached 
'Arafat. He knows that without affecting the release of the 
prisoners he will not be able to come to Gaza and Jericho with 
peace of mind. Today he sent Brigadier Ziyad al-Atrash to 
address the crowds on his behalf. [passage omitted] 
  Al-Atrash will in all likelihood convey a message to 'Arafat 
advising him not to arrive in Gaza and Jericho before he 
succeeds in dissolving this protest movement. 
  The thousands of demonstrators later held a protest march in 
Gaza City, chanting slogans calling for the release of the 
prisoners. [passage omitted] [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Halah al-'Isawi] </F>
  [Text] The Palestinian police have received the most 
up-to-date communication equipment used in the world today. Its 
range is up to 560 km. This statement was made by Muhammad 
Subayh, the permanent Palestinian representative to the Arab 
League and secretary of the Palestine National Council [PNC]. 
Subayh told AL-AKHBAR that the United States supplied the 
Palestinian police with this equipment, which is now being used 
in the region and the United States. Therefore, the Palestinian 
police force has received all kinds of equipment that will help 
it perform its duties properly, including revolvers, machine 
guns mounted on vehicles, kalashnikovs, and communication 
equipment. 
  He added that the Palestinian police force is still in dire 
need of money to develop their capabilities after power is 
transferred to the national authority. The latter will be 
concerned with performing the civilized role of a police force, 
such as combating crime and drugs, instead of the role of the 
occupation police, which was to track down the struggling 
citizens. 
  The Palestinian ambassador said he expects some chaos in 
transferring funds to the police until after the transition 
period is over. This is in view of the absence of police 
stations and posts after the occupation forces had occupied 
these stations and turned them into prisons and military camps. 
They did not develop or maintain them in any way. Even 
previously equipped stations were dismantled and removed when 
the Israeli occupation forces evacuated the self-rule areas. 
  Muhammad Subayh affirmed that there is a temporary agreement 
on issuing a Palestinian document on which "laissez passer" 
would be written. He said that he believes this is a very 
advanced step and that this document will be issued as soon as 
possible after the National Authority assumes control and a 
certain period of time is allowed for administrative stability. 
He said that the laissez passer document will be in Hebrew, 
Arabic, and English. He affirmed that it will not carry any 
Israeli stamps.

<F P=106> [Article by Smadar Peri: "This Is How the Palestinian Shin </F>
Bet Will Operate"] 
  [Text] Israel has opposed the involvement of Amin al-Hindi 
in the Gaza-Jericho talks, claiming that his hands are smeared 
with the blood of the 11 Israeli athletes massacred in Munich. 
Now al-Hindi is the strongest man in the Palestinian secret 
intelligence services. 
  Al-Hindi, one of the returned deportees, was born in Gaza 45 
years ago. His job as the head of the PLO's intelligence 
apparatus in Tunis has provided him with considerable power and 
exposed him to very sensitive information. He was in charge of 
the interrogation of 'Adnan Yasin, the Mosad agent uncovered 
less than a year ago in Abu-Mazin's [Mahmud 'Abbas] office, and 
was involved in dozens of discrete investigations and the 
gathering of intelligence material on personages and 
institutions in the Arab world and Europe. 
  Al-Hindi crossed at the Rafah border terminal three weeks 
ago 
accompanied by a large number of Palestinian bodyguards who 
prevented all attempts to photograph the man put in charge of 
the overt and covert Palestinian intelligence services in the 
territories. 
  After rumors spread that al-Hindi was involved in 
interrogations, pursuits, and initiating intelligence activity 
in the Gaza Strip, he was very quickly dubbed "the bad man." 
Indeed, he has full authority to detain, interrogate, 
incarcerate, and make use of all the means he deems necessary to 
achieve calm in the Gaza Strip. For the time being he is not 
dealing with Jericho, where the routine security problems are 
much simpler. 
  Immediately upon his arrival in Gaza, the Israeli media 
reported that al-Hindi wasted no time in entering office. He 
summoned to his office a group of senior Palestinian police 
officers and asked them to update him on the situation. 
  The first conclusion that can be drawn from that meeting is 
that we are not dealing here with a Palestinian police force, 
but rather with units of military soldiers and officers. 
'Arafat himself proved this point when he surprisingly replaced 
Ziyad al-Atrash, the Palestinian liaison officer, with 
'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya, head of the Palestine Liberation Army. 
'Arafat did not offer any explanation for this move. One can 
hazard the assessment, however, that 'Arafat did not approve of 
the close cooperation between al- Atrash and Brigadier General 
Yom-Tov Sami', the Israeli officer who worked opposite him. 
Perhaps al-Atrash was bad mouthed in Tunis, and venomous 
comments were directed to the all too receptive 'Arafat. 
  Like all Middle East leaders, 'Arafat is crazy about 
classified documents, is in love of briefings, enthralled by 
intelligence information -- even if it amounts to nothing more 
than morsels. He is especially enamored by information provided 
by the uniformed men who were brought to Gaza and Jericho from 
Arab countries, where they have resided in the shadow of local 
armies: Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Iraq, Libya, and Sudan. 
There are new faces in the area who obey their commanders and 
wear ironed uniforms. None of them have read the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement, and they have not received a precise description of 
what they are supposed to do. 
  The mission given by 'Arafat to al-Hindi -- his intelligence 
affairs confidant -- is not simple. First, he must prepare the 
ground for the chairman's arrival in the territories and make 
sure there will be no "bad surprises" such as an attempt to harm 
'Arafat and his entourage during his visit in Gaza and Jericho. 
Beyond this, 'Arafat has put al-Hindi at the head of a pyramid 
of five overt and covert intelligence networks. 
  Al-Hindi pulls all the strings. He has to maneuver between 
intelligence services incited against each other by 'Arafat 
through devious means and by remote control from Tunis. 
  Al-Hindi, who compares his status to that of the Israeli 
Mosad chief, has arrived from Tunis with a well-oiled and 
organized intelligence apparatus. He is surrounded by some 200 
to 300 agents, among them field agents, intelligence-gathering 
personnel, researchers, analysts, and intelligence 
implementation experts. This group, which is very close to 
al-Hindi, is keeping a low profile. In addition to these 
associates and his bodyguards, al-Hindi has transferred to his 
Gaza Strip offices an incalculable treasure: computers and 
boxes of disks including the PLO's intelligence archives, which 
includes thousands of names and tens of thousands of details. 
Only a handful of people know where to locate this rare archive 
which took years of hard labor to amass. 
  Under the umbrella organization of the Muhabarat 'Amma 
(general intelligence) we can find Muhammad Dahlan in the Gaza 
Strip and Jibril al-Rujub in the Jericho area. Al-Rujub, who is 
in love with the media, initially refused to limit his efforts 
to Jericho, until Israel limited his freedom of movement in 
order to curtail his operations over the entire West Bank. 
Al-Rujub brought with him from Tunis a dozen of well-trained 
intelligence officers, and until his movements were limited he 
managed to recruit local intelligence- gathering officers. 
  Dahlan, who is in charge of the Gaza Strip intelligence 
services, prefers to maintain a much lower profile than 
al-Rujub. Two local clans hold a grudge against him for the 
murder of Shaykh As'ad al-Saftawi and another figure suspected 
of cooperation with Israel. Dahlan, who since his deportation 
from the Gaza Strip has led the al-Shabibah -- Fatah's youth 
movement -- via facsimile machines, is a much less frightening 
figure than he was in the past. 
  Dahlan's main rival is Muhammad Sakir, whose life over the 
last three decades has already become something of a legend. 
Sakir, who surfaced in Gaza only 10 days ago, holds the title 
of "head of the general security service," a title that al-Rujub 
and Dahlan begrudge him. Before his arrival the journalists 
were told that during the 27 years in which he was a fugitive he 
has managed to move from one hiding place to another while 
carrying out terrorist activities, and that he has never left 
the Gaza Strip. Not everybody is convinced by this story. 
There are those who are willing to swear that a completely 
different version regarding his real whereabouts during this 
period will be uncovered soon. 
  Using his "divide and rule" tactics not only on the 
political 
level, but also on his newly formed intelligence community, 
'Arafat has explained to Sakir that he is putting him in charge 
of al-Rujub and Dahlan. These two, who are much younger than 
Sakir, are making no bones about their opposition to the 
appointment of Sakir over them. 
  The third body among the general Palestinian security and 
intelligence services is the Amn al-Ri'asah, or president's 
security. Nobody has yet been put in charge of the elite force 
-- which will include Force-17 members -- which will be in 
charge of 'Arafat's life. The name most frequently mentioned is 
that of Abu-al-Za'im ['Atallah 'Atallah], who after a quarrel 
with 'Arafat defected to Jordan and who has been residing in 
Cairo over the last few years. 
  Abu-al-Za'im has made no secrets about his desire to head 
the 
Amn al-Ri'asah again, and 'Arafat has summoned him at least 
twice to Tunis to check the extent of his support for the 
agreement and his determination to exert firm control over the 
force. 'Arafat, however, does not regard Abu-al-Za'im as the 
only candidate for this sensitive post. 
  The fourth body among the Palestinian services is the 
police force under Nasir Yusuf's command. Like the Israel 
Police, this force deals with criminal offenses, violence, 
theft, drug abuse, and preventive action against undesirable 
developments. The police intelligence must report to al-Hindi, 
who in turn reports to Tunis. 
  The fifth, and for the time the last body is "special 
intelligence." 'Arafat gave this elite unit the job of snooping 
around the other intelligence networks in the Gaza Strip and the 
West Bank. The members of this unit have to report to al-Hindi, 
but are also permitted to phone directly to the PLO chief in 
Tunis. 
  It is interesting to note that the PLO's intelligence and 
secret service community in the territories has been copied from 
the Arab multifaceted model. This is how this community 
operates in Beirut, in Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and even Tehran: A 
combination of compartmentalization and secrecy, with each 
network invading the jurisdiction of the other, all this with 
the knowledge and supervision of the chief. 
  At least three of the Palestinian intelligence bodies have 
recently entered a wild internal competition for solving two 
murder cases: The murder of two IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
soldiers at the Erez checkpoint two weeks ago, and the murder of 
two Palestinian civilians suspected of having been Israeli 
collaborators. 
  For Amin al-Hindi this is a matter of professional pride and 
prestige; he has to prove to himself, to 'Arafat, and to Israel 
that he can control the area and conduct things in a 
professional manner. He has to prove that he is no less 
proficient than his Israeli counterpart. 
  So far al-Hindi's performance appears to be very impressive 
and he is receiving good grades. Those who follow his 
performance are also taking into account the time factor: Only 
three weeks have passed since he entered his complicated office, 
which is only made more complicated by the clause named 'Arafat, 
who is not making al- Hindi's life any easier. 
  How is Palestinian intelligence operating? What is on the 
agenda of the secret intelligence services? It transpires that 
half of the very busy daily agendas of the three top men -- 
al-Hindi, Dahlan, and al-Rujub -- is occupied with dialogues 
with Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and Islamic Jihad 
members, as well as with members of Ahmad Jibril's and Nayif 
Hawatimah's rejectionist organizations. 
  The rest of their time is occupied with guarding potential 
trouble spots: The Gaza Strip refugee camps, mosques, the 
central areas of the Jericho enclave, and the passages between 
Jericho and the Gaza Strip. They also make certain that no harm 
comes to the settlers, for example, in the Jewish synagogue in 
Jericho. 
  So far, they have scored quite a success on the ground. 
Spokesmen for Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], for example, 
announced their divorce from violent activity and their 
intention to become an opposition party. In a determinant and 
unequivocal campaign, al-Hindi has managed to stop calls of 
instigation by Hamas and Islamic Jihad preachers at the Friday 
prayers at the mosques. 
  The presence of the new forces in the Gaza Strip has already 
created an additional change. The Palestinian policemen who 
arrived from Tunis behave in Gaza as they had in their previous 
place of residence: They drink alcohol, woo women, and look for 
fun. Changes on the ground have become visible: Local women 
allow themselves to walk down the streets without a veil and are 
no longer afraid to cruise the beaches. 
  "We are on hold for now," the Hamas spokesmen admit, 
"studying the situation." One of them, Mahmud al-Zahhar, a 
spokesman for the returned deportees, last week revealed that 
his men have decided to declare a temporary timeout in 
inter-Palestinian terror. They are also waiting to see how many 
prisoners Israel will release and who they will be. 
  The current tension between Hamas and the Palestinian police 
is referred to as a dormant volcano. If this continues, they 
say with satisfaction, there is room for optimism. Yet, if the 
shortage of money and medication continues, if no real changes 
take place in living conditions in the refugee camps, and if 
foreign investors call off their plans to turn the Gaza Strip 
into the Singapore of the Middle East everything will collapse. 
Hamas will gain power, the refugee camps will become sources of 
unrest, and the big frustration will burst out in violence 
against Israelis. 
  Two weeks ago, Nabil Sha'th and Dr. Zuhdi al-Nashashibi came 
to Gaza with $5,000 -- a first U.S. grant to pay the policemen's 
wages. Initial reports indicate there is a deliberate class 
distinction: A Palestinian policeman/soldier will be paid $400 
a month; a senior Palestinian police officer receives between 
$1,000 and $1,200 a month. 
  According to 'Arafat's explicit guidance, the wages will 
only 
be paid to the "men from abroad." After he threatened not to 
come to the territories before the donor countries act on their 
promises, allowing him to pay all the policemen, 'Arafat is 
creating a total disassociation between "local" and "foreign 
PLO" in the territories. Senior posts will be given to only 
returning Palestinians. 
  Is this logical? It certainly is. 'Arafat learned from 
Saddam Husayn. Paying a salary and taking care of your 
subordinate's needs ensures loyalty to the employer. The 
locals, whose intentions 'Arafat doubts, will have to make do on 
their own until the big money comes from abroad. 'Arafat wants 
to see his intelligence men well fed and free of material 
problems. 
  In the Gaza Strip last week they suspected that, though he 
is 
not in perfect health, 'Arafat in his twisted ways decided to 
act ill and spread rumors about a graver illness than the one he 
actually suffers from in order to once again postpone his 
arrival in Gaza and Jericho. 
  And, if the Palestinian Shin Bet believes that 'Arafat is 
really afraid of coming to the territories, our intelligence 
community believes that before his arrival, al-Hindi will take 
steps in advance to garner the most support possible from his 
own camp, as well as from us, to protect himself against 
surprises.

Palestinian sovereign areas will be strictly prohibited. 
  In an exclusive statement to AL-NAHAR, the source said: 
Strikes express the rejection of a certain policy. However, 
under a national authority which represents the people, there is 
no reason to hold strikes. 
  He added: Strikes are allowed in other parts of the West 
Bank because they are a legitimate activity to remove the

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Ehud Ya'ari] </F>
  [Excerpts] Before leaving Morocco this evening, PLO 
Chairman Yasir 'Arafat said that he needed $120 million before 
the end of the year. In addition, he needed another $30 million 
per month for salaries and to cover other routine expenses. 
This sum is greater than the amount officials have been 
attempting to collect, and 'Arafat said that his arrival in 
Jericho was tied to receiving the aforementioned funds. Our 
Arab affairs correspondent Ehud Ya'ari reports: 
  Notables in the territories are pressuring 'Arafat to hasten 
his arrival after they received hints that the PLO leader may 
postpone his arrival until next month. Following 'Arafat's 
talks with Morocco's King Hassan II, the Moroccans also received 
the impression that the PLO leader may decide to take his time. 
[passage omitted] 
  One of the reasons for the concern in the territories over 
any delay is the discernible trend toward the undeclared 
establishment of a quasi-military regime in the Gaza Strip and 
Jericho. 'Arafat considered declaring a state of emergency upon 
his arrival but was apparently persuaded to relent. 
Nevertheless, prominent officials in the territories fear a 
concentration of power, including the handling of civilian 
issues, in the hands of Palestinian army officers. 
  There is no shortage of examples: a major was appointed head 
of the education bureau; a lieutenant colonel was placed in 
charge of the mayor of Jericho; the commander of the Gaza Strip 
ordered mayor-designate Mansur al-Shawwa to appoint technocrats 
to the municipal council while ignoring political and 
coalitional considerations. There was a large police presence at 
the matriculation exams. Anyone stealing electricity can find 
himself facing a military decree. So can squatters on state 
land, corrupt land registration clerks, and owners of heavy 
machinery. The notables fear that the officer cadres will seize 
all the real political power and many Palestinians are 
protesting this, both within the Fatah organization, which has 
begun distributing membership cards to its activists in several 
locations, and also among the candidates for positions in the 
Palestinian Authority, which 'Arafat this evening called the 
government. So far, there are only 18 such candidates after 
Hanan 'Ashrawi and Sari Nusaybah eschewed their appointments. 
  On 'Arafat's instructions, the officers are doing their best 
to allay any concern and are personally participating in rallies 
in support of democracy and elections. They also promise to 
double the number of government employees to 40,000. There are 
complaints that the army is commandeering every vacant building, 
and even appointed ministers of the Palestinian Authority cannot 
find room for their offices. 
  As far as Israel is concerned, cooperation on security 
affairs is satisfactory. There has been a drop in the number of 
terrorist attacks although there have been delays in 
implementing the new arrangements on the Allenby Bridge and at 
the checkpoints from the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
  The Palestinian army has also adopted a reasonably tough 
line 
against Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], which mocked it in 
public, claiming that its soldiers were scavenging for food 
instead of carrying out their duties. However, no weapons have 
been confiscated so far nor has the dissemination of propaganda 
in the mosques been prohibited. That is why despite the 
requests by Israeli officials, many Palestinian policemen are 
still walking around with loaded rifles, although they have yet 
to test their prowess.

Szyszkowitz; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, 75, is a doctor, the chairman 
of the Red Crescent in Gaza, the former head of the Palestinian 
delegation in the peace talks in Washington, but, first and 
foremost, he is the moral instance of the independent, lay 
Palestinians. Despite his criticism of PLO Chairman Yasir 
'Arafat and the basic agreement with Israel concluded in 
September, 'Abd-al- Shafi advocates the success of autonomy for 
reasons of state. 
  [Szyszkowitz] How paradoxical: The Palestinians are given 
an autonomous territory and are not even able to pay the 
salaries of their police. Who is responsible for this disorder? 
  ['Abd-al-Shafi] I cannot defend the behavior of the 
Palestinians. 'Arafat has only now nominated the provisional 
government! He should have planned much further ahead, which 
would have been possible. Another thing is the money, which 
cannot be distributed because there are no structures. The 
Palestinians themselves are to blame for this chaos. Of course, 
the Israelis are not exactly making things easier for us. We 
cannot move freely, the autonomous territories are closed off. 
And we can, of course, not accept that Israel continues to try 
to keep Jerusalem out of the debate. 
  [Szyszkowitz] From the very beginning you have been against 
the agreement. Does this not harm the national cause? 
  ['Abd-al-Shafi] This autonomy agreement is bad. The 
Israelis still control everything. In Gaza they still keep 
almost 40 percent of the territory occupied. Yet, despite the 
shortcomings of the agreements, things are starting to change. 
This is why I am appealing to all Palestinians to cooperate in 
implementing the autonomy agreement as long as we do not forget 
to point to the problems. 
  [Szyszkowitz] What deficiencies can you spot in 'Arafat's 
leadership style? 
  ['Abd-al-Shafi] There is still not enough democracy. Our 
people are tired of permanently getting orders from above. 
'Arafat must strengthen and enhance the democratic structures. 
Officials should not be nominated only on the basis of personal 
considerations. 
  [Szyszkowitz] Still, the list of nominated ministers 
includes the longest-serving PLO leaders: men such as Faysal 
al-Husayni from East Jerusalem or Economics Minister Abu Ala, 
who worked out the agreement with Israel in Oslo. 
  ['Abd-al-Shafi] Oh well, there are many more excellent 
people. It is not so much a question of whether these people 
come from the inner circle or from the outside, but whether they 
are qualified for their job. With all respect for the problems 
within the Fatah movement, the building of institutions requires 
competence and not personal loyalties. 
  [Szyszkowitz] The preparations for the first elections of 
the autonomy government are dragging on somewhat. Is this 
'Arafat's intention? 
  ['Abd-al-Shafi] First of all, we would need a neutral 
commission to prepare these elections. And then the polls have 
to be held as soon as possible. Everything we can do has to be 
done soon, there is no reason to put things off. 
  [Szyszkowitz] So what is the reason that all these 
preparations have not been made? Is it only because 'Arafat is 
not sufficiently organized? 
  ['Abd-al-Shafi] To put it bluntly: 'Arafat has all the 
strings in his hand and does not want to let loose a single one. 
At any rate we must insist in close monitoring of the election, 
like in South Africa. We need all guarantees because we cannot 
afford to fail. 
  [Szyszkowitz] It looks as if even 'Arafat's severest critics 
were slowly getting ready to make a truce. Even parts of the 
Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] leadership have recently 
made relatively liberal statements. 
  ['Abd-al-Shafi] I welcome this change by Hamas, of course. 
Nevertheless, I do not think that it will participate in the 
election to the autonomy government, but I would regard it as 
good if Hamas were to found a political party. The Islamists 
will never win a majority here, anyway. 
  [Szyszkowitz] Not even if the Palestinians here in Gaza were 
to lose faith in the current leadership? 
  ['Abd-al-Shafi] At the moment, we first have to establish 
the structures. Then we will see. However, we all must try 
hard to act quickly. After all, the position of the Israelis is 
clear: They will go ahead with extending autonomy to the West 
Bank only if everything works here. This is why any delays that 
are our fault are excellent excuses for the Israelis. That way 
they can say: You see, they cannot even establish peace in 
Gaza. This is why it is so important for the Palestinians to 
concentrate all forces on implementing this agreement. I only 
hope that the PLO has understood that, too.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Significance of Abu-Mazin's Remarks"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Many Palestinians have welcomed the remarks by 
Mahmud 'Abbas, alias Abu-Mazin, a senior PLO official and a PLO 
Executive Committee member. He said something to the effect 
that this generation of revolutionaries, who have led the 
revolution and the liberation movement since 1964, must hand 
over the banner to the younger generation. Abu-Mazin expressed 
doubt that the generation of the revolution would be able to 
transform and govern a state. He emphasized that the 
Palestinian leadership needs new blood to continue the road 
forged by the generation of the revolution with their blood, 
sweat, and sacrifice. They raised the banner of struggle in the 
sixties; now the younger generation must continue the march 
until the objectives are achieved. [passage omitted] 
  Abu-Mazin's remarks are sound, wise, and logical. He is 
addressing his call to the current leadership. who began the 
revolutionary march as young enthusiastic men who are wiser now 
that they are over the age of 60. He is convinced that the 
building of a state needs younger leaders to take over the 
responsibility. He does not belittle the role that his 
generation has played in leadership, a role that will always be 
an object of admiration by our people and a model of sacrifice 
to be emulated. However, he realizes that this is the code of 
life and the logic of history. National interest dictates that 
the leadership be handed over to a generation of Palestinians 
who have relentlessly fought the occupation for over 27 years. 
They are able to deal with their problems and issues with 
pragmatism and equilibrium. 
  Over the past decades the leadership has faced many 
challenges. It has taught the young generation the meaning of 
steadfastness and defiance. It has refused to submit to 
blackmail or to surrender under the most difficult 
circumstances. It has believed in the homeland's sacred mission 
and has carried it out with honesty. It has safeguarded rights 
and has not abandoned principles. Abu- Mazin's call to the 
leadership to give the younger generation a chance to shoulder 
responsibility stems from his awareness that there is a need to 
find a formula for transferring leadership, for he fears that a 
clash might occur between the new and old leaderships in the 
struggle to establish a democratic Palestinian state. Abu-Mazin 
adds that a new Palestinian leadership has emerged, whether or 
not the current leadership admits it or not. 
  Abu-Mazin's remarks reaffirm the leadership's awareness of 
the new developments on the Palestinian land, developments that 
require new and modern formulas to solve the problems not only 
with the Israelis--the enemies of the past--but also among the 
Palestinians themselves. There is a dire need to maintain the 
unity of the national ranks, prevent any breakup of these ranks, 
and to build new concepts based on solid ground so that the 
masses will be one hand building the homeland for the sake of 
which we have sacrificed so long.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hamas spokesman Muhammad Nazzal by </F>
unidentified correspondent in Amman; date not given] 
  [Text] [AL-QUDS] What are the results of your repeated 
meetings with PLO officials? 
  [Nazzal] Following the signing of the Oslo Agreement, Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement] leadership decided to freeze all 
official contacts and meetings with the PLO leadership. Since 
then, no meetings between us have taken place. 
  [AL-QUDS] But you have met recently with 'Abbas Zaki. 
  [Nazzal] The recent meeting with brother 'Abbas was at his 
request. We did not freeze individual contacts with officials 
opposed to the PLO policy. Accordingly, my meeting with brother 
'Abbas came within this context. 
  [AL-QUDS] What about your intention to join the coming 
Palestinian Authority and its institutions and how do you view 
the future of your relations with them? 
  [Nazzal] I have informed brother 'Abbas of Hamas' official 
and final decision rejecting participation in the Palestinian 
Authority. We do not recognize this authority and do not believe 
it represents the Palestinian people. I believe it was imposed 
by a U.S.-Israeli desire. 
  [AL-QUDS] If legislative elections under the Palestinian 
Authority were held, would you take part in them? 
  [Nazzal] We believed and continue to believe in holding free 
and general elections that can ensure the election of a 
leadership representing the Palestinian people. 
  [AL-QUDS] What is the alternative to the Oslo Agreement you 
are offering to the Palestinian people and thousands of 
Palestinian families at home and abroad? 
  [Nazzal] Hamas offers resistance as an alternative to the 
settlement process. The settlement process which started in 
Madrid and ended in Oslo has brought about an extremely feeble 
agreement. The way it was drafted and its clauses constitute a 
liquidation of the Palestinian cause. We believe that the 
resistance and its continuation are essential for achieving a 
full Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian 
territories. Gaza was a burden to the occupation. What 
happened is that the Israelis traded their exit from Gaza for an 
agreement that has consecrated Israel's occupation of Palestine 
and granted the Palestinian administrative self-rule, thus 
treating Palestinians as an ethnic minority living under a 
Jewish state. 
  [AL-QUDS] But is Hamas offering resistance to steer the Oslo 
and Cairo Agreements toward the desired objectives? 
  [Nazzal] We believe that the Oslo Agreement and the 
agreements that followed it have interpreted the Declaration of 
Principles in a way that serves Israeli interests and harms 
Palestinian interests. Accordingly, Hamas believes that these 
agreements are the natural result of the policy pursued by the 
PLO leadership. 
  [AL-QUDS] Suppose that the agreement did not exist, what 
would have guaranteed that no more settlements would be built? 
  [Nazzal] When the PLO leadership decided to attend the 
Madrid 
Conference it made this conditional on halting the settlement 
activity. What happened is that the PLO has abandoned the 
condition it placed for itself. When the agreement was signed, 
no mention was made of removing or dismantling the settlements 
or even freezing settlement-building. So even the agreement 
does not provide for the guarantees referred to in the question. 
  [AL-QUDS] But don't you think that the agreement has 
preserved what is left of our land? Perhaps tomorrow we will 
not find land to negotiate about. 
  [Nazzal] I believe that the agreement has not dealt with the 
Palestinian issue as a problem of land, but a problem of a 
people. The land occupied in 1967, which according to the 
Security Council Resolutions is occupied land, has become, under 
the negotiations, disputed land. This means that the PLO's 
ceiling in the negotiations is lower than that of the so-called 
international legality, which is very strange. I do not believe 
that this agreement will preserve the Palestinian territories or 
what is left of them but instead will consecrate Israel's 
sovereignty of this area. 
  [AL-QUDS] But don't you think that the decision to take part 
in the negotiations has been made in the absence of an 
international balance of power and amid Arab fragmentation? 
  [Nazzal] Joining the negotiations under Arab weakness and 
fragmentation and in the absence of the balance of power is in 
the interest of Israel, and the Palestinians shouldn't have 
participated in the negotiations, because negotiations should be 
among strong and equal parties. Negotiations between a weak and 
a strong party will inevitably be in the interest of the strong, 
which will impose and even dictate its terms. This is what 
happened in the settlement process that started in Madrid and 
ended in Oslo. The excuses that the PLO leadership has advanced 
and is advancing for joining this process are supposed to lead 
us to results contrary to what the PLO leadership has expected. 
  [AL-QUDS] But don't you think that the Oslo and Cairo 
Agreements will prompt the Israeli leadership to abandon, even 
partly, the notion of Greater Israel? 
  [Nazzal] We must realize that the theory of Greater Israel 
still exists in the Zionist mind, but there are two approaches 
to it. One says that it can be achieved by geographic 
expansion, while the other, which is adopted by the Labor Party, 
seeks to build Greater Israel through Israel's political, 
economic, and cultural penetration of the so-called Middle East. 
One of the most important things gained from this agreement is 
that the Palestinians will be the bridge that the Israelis will 
cross into the region, thus achieving the theory adopted by the 
Labor Party. 
  [AL-QUDS] But the Palestinian National Independence 
Document stipulates the establishment of the Palestinian state 
on any part of Palestine to be liberated. So how can you 
explain your opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian 
entity on liberated land? 
  [Nazzal] When we see that any part of the Palestinian land 
is 
liberated we will be the first to express our support and 
blessings. However, we believe that the agreement is devoted to 
championing the Israeli sovereignty. We also believe that the 
agreement has not liberated anything. The settlements still 
exist in the Gaza Strip and the Israeli occupation has 
redeployed its troops and has not completely withdrawn. 
Therefore, how can we accept what they say about the so-called 
liberated land? 
  [AL-QUDS] But Israel is continuing the negotiating process 
with the Arab countries. Can Hamas guarantee its continuous 
opposition in these countries? 
  [Nazzal] The Hamas movement started and forged ahead in the 
occupied Palestinian territories. Hamas' principal 
organizational structure is still there. It will, therefore, 
not be affected by any political development that might emerge 
in Arab-Israeli relations. Also, I rule out any normalization 
in the relations so soon, particularly with regard to Syria, 
Jordan, and Lebanon. 
  [AL-QUDS] How do you envisage the future relations between 
Hamas and the opposition Palestinian forces, particularly the 
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Democratic 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine? 
  [Nazzal] After the Madrid Conference, we started to 
coordinate efforts with the opposition Palestinian forces. We 
succeeded in establishing a political alliance with them. This 
alliance aimed at forming a political base to confront the weak 
base set up by Yasir 'Arafat at the start of the Madrid 
Conference. We formed an alliance consisting of 10 Palestinian 
organizations to confront Yasir 'Arafat's alliance which is made 
up of only three groups. 
  I believe that the structure of our alliance is 
unprecedented 
on the Palestinian arena as well as in the Arab and Islamic 
arena. Our alliance included political and ideological currents 
in the "leftist nationalist and Islamic" region. We are trying 
to promote this alliance in the new stage that started with the 
implementation of the Oslo Accord. 
  [AL-QUDS] But what if the Hamas Movement wants to use its 
position in the opposition to gain the support of the masses to 
ensure its success in the upcoming elections? 
  [Nazzal] Hamas started as a resistance movement, and it has 
never aimed at assuming power. Furthermore, the authority they 
are talking about is nothing but an imaginary authority. It is 
an administration supervised by the occupation, and it is, 
therefore, a tool in the hands of the occupation. 
  [AL-QUDS] But all the provisions of the Palestinian-Israeli 
Agreement were signed. What is the most dangerous political 
challenge that might face the Palestinian people in the wake of 
the implementation of this agreement's protocols? 
  [Nazzal] This agreement has not dealt with basic issues that 
represent the core of the Palestinian cause. These issues have 
been postponed until the next stage of negotiations with the aim 
of promoting the agreement. This is because we believe that 
there are clear Israeli answers to all outstanding issues, 
namely Jerusalem, settlements, the 1948 refugees, and the 
Palestinian state. Hence, these issues will be settled only if 
the negotiations are completed in favor of the enemy. 
Therefore, the challenge facing the Palestinian people is to 
complete the march of resistance against the occupation and to 
reject the agreement and to consider it null and void.

  [Text] [No dateline as received]--Muhammad Subayh, 
Palestinian permanent representative to the Arab League and 
secretary of the Palestine National Council [PNC], has said some 
Kuwaiti elements have met with Zionist party figures, and are 
providing huge financial assistance to the racist Likud Party. 
  In an exclusive statement to the INA correspondent in Cairo, 
Subayh added that extending aid to the racist Likud Party is a 
serious issue, particularly since this party advocates the 
establishment of greater Israel extending from the Nile to the 
Euphrates; calls for expelling Arabs from occupied Palestine; is 
striving to annex Jerusalem, the Golan, and southern Lebanon to 
the Hebrew state; and is engaged in instigation against Iraq. 
He noted that such Kuwaiti conduct is condemnable and 
unacceptable. 
  Subayh went on to say: If aid is to be extended, then Arab 
and Muslim peoples everywhere, and in occupied Palestine in 
particular, are in dire need of Arab aid. Extending aid to 
Arabs and Muslims in general, and to the Palestinians in 
particular, would be better than extending it to the fascists 
who are occupying Arab lands. He described this development as 
strange and unacceptable. 
  The PNC secretary urged Kuwaiti rulers to settle the 
Palestinians' dues, as well as deductions estimated at some $70 
million, which they are still holding. 
  The Palestinian official noted the statements made by Ari'el 
Sharon, a key leader of the Likud Party, who has announced that 
it is the Zionist authorities alone who will protect Gulf oil, 
and that they will not allow any Arab country to develop and 
progress and build a scientific base. 
  Concluding his statement, Subayh said the Palestinian people 
condemn and denounce these Kuwaiti elements for supporting the 
racist Likud Party and other parties at the expense of the Arab 
nation and Palestine.

  [Text] Jerusalem, June 13 (AFP)--PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat 
has agreed to drop the stormy debate over Jerusalem "for the 
time being", a senior foreign ministry official said Monday. 
  'Arafat had made the offer in a series of letters sent to 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin last week after a major rumpus over 
the fate of the city both sides claim as capital. 
  "The PLO leader expressed his intention to smooth over 
differences and reduce tension," the official told AFP. "He is 
ready to withdraw the question of Jerusalem from the agenda for 
the time being." 
  Arafat also urged Israel to respect the written undertaken 
from Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres last October to allow 
Palestinian institutions to continue operating in East 
Jerusalem. [sentence as received] 
  Under the Declaration of Principles for autonomy, the 
Jerusalem issue would not be raised until the third year of 
Palestinian self-rule when negotiations on a permanent 
settlement are set to be begin. 
  Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 war 
and has declared the united city its eternal capital. The PLO 
demands to share Jerusalem. 
  Meanwhile, the HA'ARETZ newspaper reported that the 
government had decided not to allow 'Arafat to enter East 
Jerusalem during his visit to the autonomous Palestinian areas 
which is expected to take place sometime this month. 
  The army had voiced that 'Arafat's arrival in East Jerusalem 
would lead to clashes between Palestinians and the Israeli 
right-wing. Some extremists have called for 'Arafat to be 
murdered. 
  Rabin said last month that the PLO leader would not be 
allowed into Jerusalem for at least two years.

<F P=106> [From the "60 Minutes" program] </F>
  [Text] [Announcer] 'Abdallah Ahmad Ghanim, Yemeni minister 
of justice and envoy of the Yemeni Government, arrived in Amman 
today from Damascus with a message for His Majesty King Husayn 
from His brother Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. 
  The Yemeni envoy made a statement to our political affairs 
correspondent: 
  [Begin recording] [Ghanim] My current visit to the fraternal 
Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is to convey a message from 
Presidential Council Chairman 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih to his 
brother His Majesty King Husayn dealing with the latest 
developments in the Republic of Yemen, with stopping this war 
which was ignited by the secessionist rebels, and with the full 
implementation of the UN Security Council resolution which 
safeguards Yemen's territorial integrity. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, is there Yemeni action on the 
Arab level? 
  [Ghanim] Yes, there is Yemeni action. My visit to Jordan is 
part of this action. It is the first leg of a tour of a number 
of fraternal Arab states in order to brief them on the true 
situation in Yemen. 
  [Correspondent] What is the true situation in Yemen 
regarding 
the cease-fire? 
  [Ghanim] The true situation in Yemen is the tragedy that has 
been caused by some of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leaders 
through their rebellion and insurgence against the authority and 
public order. They did this to pave the way for announcing 
secession in order to take Yemen back to the pre-22 May [1990] 
era in violation of the Yemeni people's will, the constitution, 
and the April 1993 elections, which the whole world admitted 
were clean elections. Regarding the cease-fire, the Republic of 
Yemen has from the very beginning welcomed the UN Security 
Council resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire although 
we are convinced that this resolution is interference in our 
internal affairs. Despite this, out of our respect for 
international legitimacy, we welcomed this resolution and 
complied with it. As of yesterday, the legitimate leadership in 
the Republic of Yemen had announced a cease-fire three times. 
Regrettably, every time, the rebels violate this cease-fire, 
foment sedition, and renew fighting. There objective is to 
continue the battles to create an appropriate atmosphere to 
bring forces to disengage both Yemeni sides' troops, or 
international observers. We consider this a flagrant 
interference in the internal Yemeni affairs. 
  [Correspondent] In a statement, the UN envoy said that 
officials in Sanaa accept dialogue, and the other party might 
accept dialogue. Do you consider this a turning point in the 
situation in general? 
  [Ghanim] We have accepted dialogue from the beginning. We 
have never refused to extend our hand for the sake of dialogue 
and national reconciliation. After the declaration of 
secession, dialogue has become possible only with the YSP 
leaders who believe in unity and democracy. However, it is 
difficult to hold dialogue with the members who do not believe 
in unity, declared secession, and disavowed democracy. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you Mr. Minister. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Muslim Brotherhood Deputy General Guide Mustafa </F>
Mashhur: "Brothers, Seek God's Aid and Endure."] 
  [Text] Islam is not a religion of individuals but a 
religion of a united nation, joined by one qibla [direction of 
prayer]. It is like one body and for this reason, the form of 
address in the Koran is illustrated by God Almighty's words: "O 
Ye Who Believe." 
  The prophet, may God's peace and prayers be with him, said: 
"He who shows no concern for the affairs of Muslims is not one 
of them." 
  Now we see Muslims everywhere being persecuted, driven from 
their homes, imprisoned, tortured, even killed, and the honor of 
their women is violated. No one moves to defend them. Contrast 
this with the example of the woman who, facing aggression during 
the rule of al-Mu'tasim [Abbasid caliph], shouted "I appeal to 
al-Mu'tasim". And the caliph sent an army to defend her. The 
cause of today's events is that there is no Islamic state or 
caliphate to defend the Muslims. The Islamic nation's union was 
broken when the caliphate was overthrown. This caused Imam 
[Hasan] al-Banna to form the Muslim Brotherhood and proclaim its 
two goals: 
  First, the Islamic homeland must be freed from all foreign 
domination, this being a natural human right that is denied only 
by an unjust ruler or tyrannical oppressor. 
  Second, a free Muslim state must be established in this free 
homeland, acting in line with Islam's rules, applying its social 
system, proclaiming its righteous principles, and propagating 
its wise call to the people. Unless such a state appears, all 
Muslims will be sinful, responsible in the eyes of God Almighty 
for their failure to establish it. 
  Al-Banna said: "You are a new spirit flowing in this 
nation's heart, reviving it with the Koran. You are a new light 
dissipating the darkness of materialism with God's knowledge. 
Without exaggeration, it is only right that you should feel 
that you are shouldering this burden when everyone else has 
abandoned it." 
  Al-Banna, may God rest his soul, expected the Brotherhood to 
suffer ordeals, be accused of the most heinous offenses, and to 
be portrayed in a very ugly light by those in power. He said 
the time of testing might be lengthy but God has promised 
victory and rewards. He pointed out that despite the obstacles, 
there were factors of success, as illustrated by the strength of 
the call, the world's need for it, and God's support. No 
obstacle can face these factors of success. 
<H5>  An Unjustified Campaign and False Accusations </H5>
  I remembered al-Banna's words when I saw the recent 
unjustified security and media campaigns against the Muslim 
Brotherhood and the drive to falsely accuse it of crimes. This 
is happening even though several officials formerly spoke well 
of the Brotherhood and said it was innocent of violence. In an 
earlier article, I recounted the Brotherhood's stances since its 
establishment and the ordeals and false accusations it suffered, 
but which it was innocent of. I refuted many false accusations, 
such as our being called terrorists and extremists. I noted the 
attempt to blur the distinction between the Brotherhood and 
other groups and felt that this blurring was intentional. In 
this article I wish to clarify matters and state that we carry 
out our activities with moderation and through the state's 
institutions. I also wish to remind the brothers of the nature 
of their call, which I have already served for 56 years, 20 of 
them in jail. 
  Relying on Imam al-Banna's sayings, I wish to assert to the 
brothers that their path is a sound one and the accusations 
against them unfounded. I also wish to make it clear to the 
public that the Muslim Brothers, who have suffered much for the 
sake of Islam and in upholding its principles, cannot possibly 
violate its teachings or its methods. In this they follow the 
example of the prophet, may God's prayers and peace be with him, 
and his companions, may they reside in God's pleasure. The 
prophet used to instruct the Muslims in Mecca--who were injured, 
tortured, and killed--to endure and remain steadfast. He 
carried to them the glad tidings that God would grant victory to 
His religion. This actually came to pass when the Arabian 
Peninsula was purged of idolatry and false Gods, the Jews were 
driven off, Persia was conquered, the Byzantines were defeated, 
darkness was lifted, and light was spread. 
  We must be optimistic. We must preserve the hope that the 
future is for this religion, no matter how much time it takes or 
how numerous the obstacles. Let us seek God's aid and endure. 
This was the commandment of Moses, may God's peace be with him, 
to his nation after the world accused them of corruption on 
earth to incite people against them. 
  Moses said to his people: "Pray for help from God and wait 
in patience and constancy, for the earth is God's to give as a 
heritage to such of his servants as he pleaseth; and the end is 
best for the righteous." [Koranic verse] 
  The promise of victory was fulfilled. "And we made a people 
who were considered weak the inheritors of the land in both East 
and West, lands whereon we sent down our blessings." [Koranic 
verse] 
<H5>  Endurance, Steadfastness, and Avoidance of Provocation </H5>
  Muslim Brothers: Whether people recognize you or not, you 
have performed your Islamic work in response to your God's order 
and in compliance with your Islamic creed. Your aim is to 
please God, whether people are pleased with you or not, and 
whether you are harmed or not. You are not more noble than the 
prophet and his companions, who were subjected to harm, torture, 
and murder but endured and remained firm. They were granted 
victory by God; it is God, the wise and mighty, who grants 
victory. Be assured that these materialistic forces that are 
trying to impose themselves will fail. It is not a matter of 
size and equipment, but one of truth and falsehood. Nothing is 
true except that which comes from God, namely, the religion God 
accepts: (The religion before God is Islam), and (if anyone 
desires a religion other than Islam, never will it be accepted 
of him, and in the hereafter he will be in the ranks of those 
who have lost all spiritual good), and (it is not ye who slew 
them; it was God: when thou threwest a handful of dust, it was 
not thy act, but God's), and (Thus doth God show forth truth and 
vanity. For the scum disappears like froth cast out, while that 
which is for the good of mankind remains on the earth), and 
(Nay, we hurl the truth against falsehood, and it knocks out its 
brain, and behold falsehood doth perish) [Koranic verses]. 
  Muslim brothers: Endure, stand fast, and be proud of your 
affiliation with Islam and of your work to restore its glory, 
entity, and mastery. Be careful not to be provoked into an 
action that conflicts with the teachings of your God. The 
strong ones do not react emotionally, but control themselves 
when they are angry. Nothing will happen to us except what God 
wants to happen to us. He is our master, and he wants good for 
us, although it may look evil (but it is possible that ye 
dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing 
that is bad for you. But God knoweth and ye know not) [Koranic 
verse]. 
  We have been subjected to harm, torture, imprisonment, and 
killing, but God helped us endure. The credit for this 
endurance does not go to ourselves, but first and foremost to 
God. Some of us stayed 20 years in prison under various kinds 
of pressure without their resolve being shaken. Among those is 
his eminence the current [Muslim Brotherhood] general guide, 
Muhammad Hamid Abu-al-Nasr. Here he is, continuing his march 
firmly and resiliently, proud of his call, optimistic that the 
future is for Islam (and we wished to be gracious to those who 
were being oppressed on the land, to make them leaders in faith 
and make them heirs, to establish a firm place for them in the 
land) [Koranic verse]. Remember the advice imam Hasan al-Banna 
gave you: "Believe in God and be proud of knowing him and 
depending on him. Do not fear anyone but him, perform the 
duties he imposed on you, and avoid what he asked you to avoid." 
  O people, know that no one is more loyal to the homeland 
than 
the youths of the Muslim Brotherhood. They regard their service 
to their homeland as a religious duty through which they get 
closer to God; they are not after personal or material gains. 
  The martyr imam said: Know, brothers, that your call is 
innocent and fair; it goes beyond personal interests and 
disdains material gains. 
  He also said: We would like our nation--and all Muslims are 
our nation--to know that they are more dear to us than 
ourselves, and that we love to sacrifice ourselves for their 
might, glory, dignity, religion, and aspirations. He also said: 
We are for you, beloved ones, not for others, and we will never 
be against you. 
<H5>  "This is Our Religion, and This is Our Policy" </H5>
  Imam al-Banna responded to the claim about separation of 
religion and politics by saying: If you are asked what you 
advocate, say: We advocate Islam, which Muhammad, God's prayers 
and peace be upon him, has brought. The Government is part of 
Islam and freedom is one of its duties. If you were told this 
is politics, say: This is Islam and we do not know of such 
divisions. He says on another subject in response to those who 
claim that we hide behind religion: "Our kinfolk, we call upon 
you with the Koran in our right hand, the Prophet's teachings in 
our left hand, and the good actions of our predecessors as our 
example. We call upon you to get into Islam, the teachings of 
Islam, the rules of Islam, and the guidance of Islam. If you 
considered this politics, then this is our policy. If someone 
who calls on you to adopt these principles is regarded as a 
politician, then we are the most veteran in politics, thank God. 
If you choose to call this politics, then call it what you want. 
Names will not harm us when the purpose is clear." 
  Brothers, seek God's help, be patient, and have confidence 
in 
your Lord and his support and defense. Have confidence in your 
course, creed, and program. Know that victory comes with 
patience and that relief comes after hardship. Remember what 
Imam al-Banna said: "A man is tested by his patience, 
persistence, and consistent serious work. Whoever of you wants 
to pick a fruit before it is ripe or cut a flower before its 
time, he will not be doing the right thing, and it would be 
better for him to seek another calling. Whoever maintains 
patience with me until the seed grows, the tree matures, and the 
fruit becomes ripe for picking, his reward will be with God; and 
the reward of those who do good will not be forgotten. Either 
victory and sovereignty or martyrdom and happiness." 
  Brothers, know that God asked us to have sincere intentions 
and be well prepared and leave the results of our actions to 
Him. Our Prophet, God's prayers and peace be upon him, says: 
"This religion is solid, so tread carefully in its path; 
overzealousness yields puny results." 
  Brothers, know that your group is like a tree planted by the 
martyred imam and irrigated by his blood and the blood of 
martyrs before and after him, making its roots grew deeper, its 
trunk grow stronger, and its branches spread farther. It has 
become difficult for its enemies to kill, and it has started to 
give fruit all the time, God willing. 
  Remember that Imam al-Banna said that "either you are in the 
call or out, and if the call is not in you, it will be in 
others, 'and if you turn back from the bath, God will substitute 
in your stead another people; then they would not be like you' 
[Koranic verse]." 
  Let everyone who assists in the oppression of others, even 
by 
a word (as a journalist), by the adoption of a law (as deputies 
of the People's Assembly), or by harming and torturing (as a 
soldier), let them know that they are responsible before God for 
all this, and that those they assist will not be different 
before God. Let everyone know that oppression is darkness on 
Judgement Day and that God listens to the prayers of the 
oppressed. Those who are detained unjustly, their relatives and 
children will continue to ask God to punish the oppressors, and 
God will answer their prayers. All those who collaborate in 
injustice will regret their actions, but at a time when regret 
will be useless. God be my witness, I have conveyed the 
message. "Think not that God doth not heed the deeds of those 
who do wrong." [Koranic verse]

  [Excerpt] AL-MAJD has learned that President Saddam Husayn 
has made major changes in the Iraqi security agencies. Major 
General Sabir al-Duri, director of the General Intelligence, was 
transferred to the post of an adviser at the Presidency and 
replaced as director of General Intelligence by al-Anbar 
Governor Mani' 'Abd-al-Rashid. 
  A reliable source arriving from Iraq said three more 
officials from the al-Duri tribe, which is known for its close 
links to the regime, were dismissed from their posts. These are 
Khadr al-Duri, member of the Regional Command of the ruling 
Ba'th Party; 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Duri; and 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Duri, 
who is said to have fled to Syria. 
  The Iraqi source said Maj. Gen. al-Duri was dismissed from 
his post as intelligence chief probably after it was discovered 
that the Iraqi intelligence service was involved in the 
assassination of the Iraqi opposition figure Shaykh Talib Suhayl 
in Beirut and the assassination of a German journalist named 
Lisi Schmidt [name as published]. An officer named Safi 
al-Tikriti was in charge of the two operations. [passage

<F P=106> [Report by 'Adnan Husayn: "Clashes in Mosul and Explosions </F>
in Baghdad"] 
  [Text] The Iraqi Dispatch Authority, which is close to the 
opposition "[Unified] Iraqi National Congress [UINC]," has said 
that fighting broke out on the morning of the day before 
yesterday among Iraqi Army units in Mosul, which is situated in 
the area adjacent to the Kurdish region. It added that the 
roads linking Mosul with the Kurdish cities of Dahuk, Irbil, and 
Karkuk were closed after the start of the fighting, in which it 
said "the commander of a brigade from the al-Jubur tribe and 
another from al-Ghazlaniyyin tribe" participated. 
  Al-Jubur officers were one of the influential blocs in the 
Iraqi Army until two years ago when a group of them were accused 
of planning to overthrow and kill President Saddam Husayn. 
Scores of them were executed and hundreds subsequently 
dismissed from service. 
  A UINC official told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT over the telephone 
yesterday from his office in Salah al-Din in Iraqi Kurdistan 
that the roads between Mosul and the Kurdish areas were reopened 
yesterday and that he had received information that clashes took 
place a few days ago among Iraqi military units stationed around 
Karkuk. 
  The Iraqi Dispatch Authority said that "three successive 
explosions occurred in Baghdad 30 May." And that the first 
explosion occurred "in Saddam Husayn's new house in Corniche 
al-A'zamiyah" on the Tigris River and the second "in the Ba'th 
Party's headquarters in al-A'zamiyah." 
  On the situation in the Kurdish areas UINC sources said that 
the fighting among the warring Kurdish militias has stopped in 
the Halabjah area adjacent to the border with Iran. And that 
the cease-fire and disengagement of the forces were holding in 
the Qal'at Dizah area yesterday.

<F P=106> [Report by Salwa al-Ustuwani: "Damascus Urges Christopher </F>
To Bring Something New If He Wants Successful Visit"] 
  [Excerpt] Damascus, Cairo, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- [passage 
omitted] On the eve of U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher's arrival in the region a Syrian official has told 
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that, if Christopher wants his latest visit to 
succeed, he must bring something new as well as clear answers to 
the fundamental questions Damascus raised during his recent 
visit, because both the fate and the resumption of the peace 
process will be determined by these answers. 
  The Syrian official added that Damascus does not believe 
that 
Christopher is coming to the region empty-handed. Or that he is 
going to expose himself to the difficulty and hardship of travel 
without bringing something new with him. Nor do we believe that 
the United States would risk its credibility and reputation and 
evade its pivotal role in the peace process. 
  The Syrian official pointed out that Syria is waiting to see 
what Christopher is going to bring with him. And that it 
stresses once again that he is going to receive every response 
inasmuch as Syria truthfully and sincerely aspires to peace -- a 
peace called the peace of the brave based on justice and 
comprehensiveness. The official said: If Israel really is 
seeking to establish this peace, it -- before anyone else -- 
knows the roads leading to it, otherwise this peace is going to 
remain a dream that cannot be realized, thereby pushing the 
region toward numerous probabilities. 
  The Syrian official accused Israel of seeking to achieve 
separate deals on all the Arab axes. And that it has prepared 
for them secretly under the peace slogan in order to impose its 
conditions on the Arabs individually. 
  The official said: We do not believe that Washington is 
going to let Israel diminish its role. Because the current U.S. 
role does not allow it to implement the will of one party to the 
exclusion of another, especially when that party is in breach of 
international law. And Israel's interests and relations with 
the Arabs cannot allow it to be able to impose its conditions 
and what it terms its peace and security in the region. And the 
United States is fully aware that separate deals will not lead 
to peace. In fact, that attitude is going to make peace 
prospects remote.

  [Text] June 13, IRNA -- Iran's ambassador to Tokyo, Hoseyn 
Kazempur-Ardebili here today denied a KYODO report that Iran was 
test-firing N. Korean missile. 
  KYODO on Sunday quoted a U.S. weekly, "U.S. NEWS AND WORLD 
REPORT," that Japan was urging Iran to stop the missile test. 
  In a letter to managing director of the International 
Department of KYODO news service, the ambassador said the United 
States has launched a campaign to pressure Japan and other 
industrial countries to limit their commercial activities with 
Iran by raising such allegations. 
  "Regarding our nuclear program, as part of its post-war 
reconstruction, Iran has sought to repair its damaged industrial 
infrastructure. Major damage was inflicted on Iran's power 
generation facilities. To deal with this urgent problem and to 
meet the growing demand of the population, Iran has looked to 
other sources. Major investments have been made in the past 20 
years in nuclear power generation and it is natural to continue 
and build on these investments for the immediate and prospective 
power needs of the nation," the ambassador said. 
  "Our nuclear facilities have been visited and inspected by 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and their peaceful 
applications have been verified," said the ambassador.

  [Text] New Delhi -- Congress shedding all manner of 
diffidence over the economic reforms, has resolved to go the 
whole hog culminating in the State engaged only in social 
endeavour rather than industry. 
  The axe will inevitably fall on the grossly inefficient 
public sector, the sick industry and inefficient state power 
boards, Congress economic policy resolution adopted by the AICC 
here declared. There will be more reform as the people want more 
reform, and these will have to travel down to the district level. 
  Finance Minister Manmohan Singh and Agriculture Minister 
Balram Jakhar led the Government's defence of its economic 
policiers while participating in the debate on the economic 
resolution . 
  The resolution was later passed after a four-hour debate. 
  Role of the Government in the new environment already stands 
transformed, the Congress document stated. The State will 
gradually shift out of industry and trade in order to 
concentrate on education, rural, development, and healthcare, 
the party resolution said in what is a complete and clean break 
from the baggage of socialist ideology. 
  This, as the party bosses including N D Tiwari and Pranab 
Mukherjee who opened the debate on the economic policy stated, 
was the essence of the middle path advocated by Prime Minister P 
V Narasimha Rao in his Davos speech earlier this year. 
  The middle path meant unleashing the economy, with the 
Government assuming the responsibility of social tasks. 
  Launching a veiled attack on the public sector, Congress 
declared that "social obligations are best met when public 
enterprises make profits, and not losses." Taxpayers had 
invested Rs 140,000 crore in the Central public sector, while 
returns are less than Rs 300 crore per year. 
  Government would have to give the highest priority to 
"technological, organisational, and managerial restructuring of 
the public sector so that it operates commercially in a 
businesslike manner.' 
  Rarlgarajan anl Goswarni committee reports on the 
restructuring of the public sector must be implemented. 
  In similar vein, Congress has cracked the whip on 
inefficient 
state electricity boards.

  [Text] Faysal al-Husayni is establishing a shadow 
government in East Jerusalem to be made up of nine ministries. 
A Palestinian source told our correspondent Moti Amir that the 
shadow government will be headed by a prime minister, two deputy 
prime ministers, and a financial inspector general who will deal 
with the expenses of the government and coordinate it with the 
expenditures of the Palestinian Authority in the self-rule 
areas. The shadow government will also include a political 
affairs ministry and a defense and general security ministry, 
contrary to the Palestinian Authority in the self-rule areas.

  [Text] Palestinian leader Faysal al-Husayni has denied 
reports that he is setting up a shadow government, but in an 
interview with Neil Sandler, al-Husayni confirmed that a 
coordinating body of Palestinian institutions was being 
established in East Jerusalem. 
  [Begin recording] [Al-Husayni] What we are doing is to make 
a sort of coordination between the Palestinian institutions. 
So, we will have no duplication, we will work with minimum 
resources that we have to create the maximum work that we could. 
  [Sandler] And that is specifically what? Who are the people 
that will be involved in this shadow government that you are 
setting up, and will they be residents of East Jerusalem? 
  [Al-Husayni] Another time: We are not talking about a shadow 
government. We are talking about institutions which is in 
Jerusalem, and we are talking about education and decisions we 
are [words indistinct] education, culture, health, other 
institutions who are from long, long ago, which is work for the 
peace and for creating the peace process. So all these 
institutions, who are helping the Palestinian people, are in 
need of a sort, as I told you, of coordination. 
  [Sandler] Now, how do you think this will sit with what 
Prime 
Minister Rabin has said about the fact -- and other Israeli 
ministers -- about Palestinian institutions that should be 
located in Jericho and not in Jerusalem? 
  [Al-Husayni] I don't believe that we have any of these 
institutions who are part of the Palestinian Authority in 
Jericho and Gaza. What we have here is institutions who were 
working all the time before the Oslo agreement and after the 
Oslo agreement. It was here before the Cairo agreement, and it 
will continue after the Cairo agreement. There is some 
institutions which is related to the peace process, and it will 
going on until we will end all our negotiations concerning the 
whole issue, including Jerusalem. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report on interview with PLO official Nabil Sha'th by Yariv </F>
Ben-Yehuda at the Rafah border terminal "several minutes ago" -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] Nabil Sha'th said today that East Jerusalem will be 
the capital of an independent Palestinian state. He said this 
prior to leaving Egypt for the Gaza Strip. Sha'th arrived at 
the Rafah border terminal several minutes ago. In an interview 
with our correspondent Yariv Ben-Yehuda, Sha'th refused to say 
when 'Arafat will arrive in the autonomous area: 
  [Begin recording] [Ben-Yehuda] Nabil Sha'th crossed into 
the Rafah border terminal several minutes ago. Sha'th told IDF 
Radio that no date has been set for Yasir 'Arafat's arrival in 
Gaza and Jericho, but he believes that 'Arafat will arrive by 
the end of the month: 
  [Sha'th, in English] He is preparing for his return. I 
don't have a date, but I suppose it will not be after the end of 
this month. I think he will be coming.... 
  [Ben-Yehuda, interrupting, in English] How much money have 
you brought with you this time? 
  [Sha'th] I don't give out that information. The money that 
is being transferred here is enough to pay all the salaries that 
have not been paid and all the expenses that have not been paid. 
Very soon the World Bank is going to assume responsibility for 
transferring the $42 million we agreed on in Paris. It will be 
transferred directly by the World Bank. 
  [Ben-Yehuda] What are you planning to do in the next few 
days? 
  [Sha'th] I am planning to start my life, my home, my office, 
and to solve the problems that have not been solved. 
  [Ben-Yehuda] You are here to stay? 
  [Sha'th] I am here to stay. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Fatah Central Committee Member 'Abbas </F>
Zaki Tells AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: My Contacts With Opposition 
Factions Aimed at Averting Internal Sedition for Which Israelis 
Are Planning"] 
  [Excerpts] Tunis, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Fatah Central 
Committee member 'Abbas Zaki, who has just returned from a 
mission to Amman and Damascus assigned to him by Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat, has denied reports that he recently 
played a mediation role between 'Arafat and the factions opposed 
to the Palestinian-Israeli peace agreement with a view to 
persuading them to participate in the [Palestinian] National 
Authority. He said that "these reports are absolutely baseless." 
  He added that "the contacts and talks he held with Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement] in Damascus and with the 
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the Popular 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], the PFLP-General 
Command, and other independent figures were aimed at finding a 
formula for coexistence among the Palestinian forces so as to 
spare the Palestinian people the internal sedition and massacre 
the Israelis are seeking to detonate in Gaza so that it becomes 
like southern Lebanon." 
  In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Zaki said that he was 
seeking during his contacts in Amman and Damascus to agree with 
the Palestinian parties on "a document of honor with which 
everyone would comply in the stage ahead." [passage omitted] 
  Asked about the nature of the future relationship between 
Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, Zaki stressed that "Hamas' 
refusal to participate in the authority does not mean that it 
will not be in the self-rule institutions. The Palestinian 
police has welcomed it, and it too has agreed to participate in 
the rebuilding process." 
  He added that the relationship with Hamas is continuing in a 
manner that allows agreement on specific issues such as the form 
and nature of the next struggle and the ability to spare the 
self-rule areas an internal conflict. He pointed out that, 
"despite Hamas' refusal to join the authority's formation, the 
door of dialogue is still open to it." [passage omitted] 
  He pointed out that there is information about Israeli 
preparations to generate internal sedition in Gaza so that it 
becomes like southern Lebanon. They have been planning for that 
for some time." [passage omitted] 
  Zaki said that the factions with which he met in Damascus 
"are convinced of the need to work to avoid Palestinian-izing 
the conflict." He pointed out that these factions still insist 
on the need to torpedo the agreement and its results. And that 
the talks with the factions in Damascus "focused on not harming 
the internal front and on continuing the democratic dialogue." 
[passage omitted] 
  Concluding his statement, Zaki warned "of an approaching 
massacre for which the Israelis are planning." He wondered: 
"Should our hands remain tied?" He went on: "We have not 
obtained anything in order for us to change our alliances. We 
have obtained only 4 percent of the Yigal Allon plan. So we 
should not -- on the pretext that powers have been transferred 
to us -- play any tyrannical role. We should not fight one 
another. The authority should not claim that it has begun to 
replace its conflict with Israel with a conflict with the 
opposition, which, in turn, should not escape from the Israeli 
monster in order to fight the authority."

  [Text] Sources in 'Arafat's police have said that the 
[Palestinian] policeman killed last night at a joint checkpoint 
manned by 'Arafat's police and Zionist troops was Khalil 
Abu-Hamzah. The incident occurred when he arrived to take up his 
position at the joint checkpoint on the Netzarim-al-Munthar 
road. Three gunshots were immediately fired at him from a 
nearby farm. One gunshot hit him in the right side of the 
chest. The source asserted that the shooting was deliberate. 
  Our correspondents say that the perpetrators of this 
operation were probably Mosad men and their agents or a group of 
settlers. 
  The Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine has issued a 
statement accusing the settlers of killing policeman Abu-Hamzah. 
The statement said this criminal incident stresses that the 
Zionists harbor only malice and racism against the Palestinian 
people and all Arabs and Muslims. The life of a Palestinian is 
targeted just because he is a Palestinian, whether he is a 
policeman who is asked to protect the Gaza-Jericho agreement--an 
agreement that guarantees the security of both the Zionist 
entity and settlements--or the mujahidin who protect our people 
from malice, racism, and occupation. 
  In its statement, the Movement condemned this criminal 
incident, and emphasized that it will escalate its militant 
activities against the Zionists.

<F P=106> [Report by Riyad Miqdadi: "OPEC Expects Oil Prices To </F>
Continue To Increase Until End of Year"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- Well-informed OPEC sources have confirmed 
that OPEC ministers could decide to cancel their next 
ministerial meeting, scheduled to be held in September, with a 
view to sending a strong message to the market that OPEC is 
going to adhere to its decision to extend the enforcement of the 
output ceiling totaling 24.528 million barrels a day until the 
end of the year. 
  The sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that there is great 
support for the Saudi proposal to cancel the meeting. They 
pointed out that this issue is at the top of the agenda of the 
OPEC ministers' meetings in Vienna this week. That is, in 
addition to compliance with output quotas and the election of a 
new secretary general. 
  An OPEC source told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: "The talks are being 
held this time in favorable conditions, as oil prices have 
increased by more than 25 percent since the organization's last 
meeting in March, and they are expected to improve further in 
the coming months." 
  The source added that "the continued gradual improvement in 
oil prices since OPEC's last meeting in Geneva last March 
confirms the success of the organization's strategy to defend 
its market quota." 
  The organization's sources expect oil prices to increase by 
another $3 between now and the end of the year, provided member 
states adhere to their quotas. An official from one of the 
delegations said that "production excesses were the main cause 
of the organization's loss of a lot of its credibility in the 
market. And even though production excesses in recent months 
have been relatively limited, they have limited the chances of a 
bigger improvement in oil prices."

  [Excerpts] The Secretariat of the General People's 
Committee concluded today its 10th ordinary meeting for this 
year. 
  Following its two-day meeting, the committee adopted a 
number 
of decisions on facing up to some negative phenomena which have 
caused an increase in the prices of a number of commodities and 
services, and to the causes of the pressures on the Libyan dinar 
-- pressures brought about by certain unlawful practices -- 
which have led to a drop in the real value of the income of part 
of the population. 
  The committee's Secretariat has asked the Central Bank of 
Libya to study the matter and come up with a date to start 
paying sums of money in hard currency to citizens to enable them 
to face up to their difficulties, as well as to define what sums 
of money should be paid in every deserving case. 
  The Secretariat has reiterated the need to the brother 
secretary of the General People's Committee for economy and 
trade and to the governor of the Central Bank of Libya to open 
the credits necessary for the provision of the local market with 
the required commodities, through the legally recognized 
channels. [passage omitted] 
  The Secretariat has also asked the Central Bank of Libya to 
consider an increase in the interest rate in order to encourage 
savings with the banks. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tripoli, 12 Jun (JANA) -- The Western official mass 
media has launched a noticeable campaign, characterized by panic 
and alarm, against the statements made to a Lebanese court by 
Palestinian defendant Yusuf Sah'ban. The campaign has been 
started in an attempt to cast doubt over these statements. The 
Palestinian defendant has admitted to the whole world that he 
blew up Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie in Scotland. 
  JANA's international affairs editor comments on this by 
querying the reasoning behind the panic among the western mass 
media and colonialist quarters. He wonders about the reason 
behind this unprecedented uproar, which began when the 
Palestinian defendant announced his admission -- which was heard 
by the whole world with no exception. 
  Does this panic express a breakdown in the plots of 
colonialism and material forces? This expresses their bitter 
feeling that they have failed once again, and in an undisputed 
way, to defend their fabrications, mask their lies, and to turn 
them into realities.

arrived in Cairo yesterday on a visit of several days to Egypt 
on the first leg of a tour of a number of Arab and African 
countries. He will explain the Somali viewpoint regarding the 
establishment of a confederation between the north and south. 
He expressed his gratitude to Egypt and to President Husni 
Mubarak, saying that Egypt offered a great deal to Somalia and 
its people. He noted that the reconciliation conference that 
was convened in Cairo among all Somali rival factions reached 
important resolutions that served the Somali cause. He pointed 
out that the situation in Somalia is steadily improving and that 
calm prevails in the country. He said that a conference will be 
held next month for an agreement on the establishment of a 
confederation between the north and south so that there will be 
no central government.

  [Text] Cairo, 14 Jun (MENA)--Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali 
Akbar Velayati has said that his various meetings with Egyptian 
Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa dealt, in total frankness, with the 
views of Iran and Egypt on many current issues and with ways to 
build confidence between the two countries. 
  In a statement to AL-AHRAM, which the paper will publish 
tomorrow, Wednesday, Velayati denied that his country has 
assisted any terrorist group in Egypt or Algeria. He also 
denied that Iran is holding Egyptian prisoners since the 
Iraq-Iran war. All Egyptian prisoners were handed over to 
Egypt, he said. 
  Velayati invited the foreign minister of the United Arab 
Emirates [UAE] to visit Tehran to continue the peaceful dialogue 
on the future of the three UAE islands. This dialogue stopped 
about a year ago. 
  Velayati said: If there is a solution to this problem, then 
it must be found through peaceful dialogue. But if one side 
tries to get others involved in the situation or 
internationalize the issue, then this side will lose more. 
  The Iranian foreign minister expressed his belief that the 
security of the Gulf region starts with economic, political, and 
security cooperation, but he admitted that the essence of this 
idea has not been discussed. 
  Velayati said that Iran's spending on armaments, considering 
the population, is less than that of any country in the region. 
He said Iran spends only 4 percent of its budget on arms.

  [Text] Cairo, 14 Jun (MENA)--Interior Minister Hasan 
al-Alfi has stressed that the Interior Ministry has complete 
information about terrorist organizations in Egypt and abroad. 
He said the Interior Ministry has worked out an integrated plan 
to besiege these organizations. 
  The only aim of those groups, said al-Alfi, is to seize 
power 
for the funds they receive from abroad. 
  In a conference held today by the Egyptian-French 
Businessmen 
Society to learn about the security situation in Egypt and its 
impact on investment, the interior minister said the ministry is 
using developed and modern methods, and arranging civilized and 
scientific training for personnel to confront the terrorist 
groups. 
  Security agencies will never rest as long as a single 
terrorist remains on Egypt's soil, al-Alfi said. 
  He stressed that the problem with the terrorist groups is 
not 
only a security one. All state institutions must contribute to 
the confrontation, and al-Azhar has a role to play in rectifying 
the extremist thought, he explained. 
  Asked about the involvement of Muslim Brotherhood members in 
terrorism, the interior minister said certain acts and facts 
indicate that some Muslim Brotherhood members committed acts 
punishable by law. 
  He said all facts and all emerging signs point to the 
involvement of those elements, who number more than 100 people, 
and are now being interrogated by the High State Security 
Prosecution. 
  He said investigations have proved that there is 
coordination 
between terrorist groups at home and abroad. 
  Al-Alfi also noted coordination between Egypt and other 
countries to confront terrorism and extradite criminals. He 
said: Training camps for terrorists do exist in some countries. 
We are not talking about a specific state, and it is in the 
interest of the investigations that everything is announced in 
due course.

<F P=106> ["Calmly" column by Ibrahim Nafi'] </F>
  [Excerpt] Based on highly trustworthy sources and confident 
of the accuracy of my information, I can say that Egyptian 
security has now succeeded in completely containing the 
terrorism phenomena and in accomplishing what has not been done 
by previous security efforts throughout the past years, that is, 
to fully penetrate the secret terrorist organizations that have 
tried to destabilize Egyptian society and distort the image of 
the Islamic religion in the eyes of the world. 
  This penetration, which is long overdue and succeeded by 
virtue of the current wise security policy, has achieved 
tremendous results in the past few months in liquidating one 
terrorist ring after another and uncovering all their leaders, 
financial sources, and lines of communication. What remains are 
only sporadic pockets that will be liquidated one after the 
other and no day will pass without the arm of security and 
stability uncovering one of them. This does not mean that we 
should belittle the danger of the hidden fingers that are still 
moving terrorism from inside or outside our country. This also 
does not mean that we must relax the policy of firmly 
confronting terrorism, which is being pursued by all sectors of 
the state, until this destructive wave that has undermined our 
domestic life and affected our economy and the livelihood of 
large segments of our people has receded completely. [passage

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-'Azim Darwish] </F>
  [Text] Opposition parties strongly suspect the positive 
response of the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) to their 
demand for making the long-awaited national dialogue more 
inclusive is nothing but a "conspiracy" to divide their own 
ranks. Opposition figures argue that the NDP, by including the 
chairmen of all political parties in a preparatory committee, 
sought to give "opposition doves the opportunity to swallow up 
opposition hawks". 
  In a letter to President Husni Mubarak last month, the 
opposition demanded the inclusion of all parties, regardless of 
their size or role, in the preparatory committee. Mubarak, who 
chairs the NDP, responded positively and decided to expand the 
committee from its original 25-member set-up. The committee's 
exact make-up, however, is yet to be announced, although it was 
said at the time that its first meeting would be held the first 
week of May. 
  Opposition figures feared that the minor, and largely 
moderate, parties would automatically align themselves with the 
NDP if they were represented on the preparatory committee, and 
would back the NDP in what the opposition views as its attempt 
to impose a "government-inspired" agenda on the proposed 
dialogue, thus pouring water on the burning issues opposition 
hawks seek to raise. 
  The NDP's decision to enlarge the preparatory committee 
"appears to be a positive response to opposition demands but in 
fact it is aimed at ensuring that a significant number of 
opposition parties take sides with the NDP and its 
government-inspired agenda", said Dr. Hilmi Murad, deputy 
chairman of the Islamist-oriented Labour Party. 
  At issue is the opposition demand, to which the NDP objects, 
that political reform be given top priority on the dialogue's 
agenda. Murad fears the minor parties would back the NDP's 
position that economic reform should take precedence over 
political questions. 
  Lutfi Wakid, deputy chairman of the leftist Progressive 
Unionist Party [NPUG], described as positive the NDP's decision 
to enlarge the preparatory committee. "But what really counts 
is action on the ground, the government's response to the 
people's demand for greater democracy," Wakid said. "Only when 
the dialogue materialises and results are achieved will we be 
able to say whether the NDP's decision was a good move." 
  Wakid said the decision, in itself, does not prove the good 
intentions of the ruling party. "It could be aimed at bypassing 
the opposition's demands," he said. "The course and results of 
the dialogue alone are what counts." 
  Murad, for his part, rejected repeated assertions by Safwat 
al- Sharif, the NDP's assistant secretary-general, that the 
hoped-for dialogue would not be a "dialogue of confrontation". 
Al-Sharif had argued the NDP did not plan to face the 
opposition across the negotiating table but, rather, all parties 
would be involved in the exchange of views. 
  But for Murad, a confrontation is inevitable. "The NDP has 
its declared policies and the opposition parties have declared 
theirs," Murad said. "If the NDP Government plans to simply 
listen to the opposition's views, the dialogue will be useless. 
The government must have the true readiness to be persuaded 
that other (opposition) policies might produce better results 
than its own policies." 
  However, Murad added this did not mean opposition parties 
shared identical positions. Wakid likewise noted there are 
"clear contradictions in opposition ranks", declaring some 
opposition parties were "more reactionary" than the NDP. As an 
example, he said the NPUG and Wafd shared similar positions on 
the demand for greater democracy and public freedoms but were 
divided by basic differences on the questions of social and 
economic development. 
  Murad conceded that the opposition parties were divided on 
the agenda of the proposed dialogue, but said coordination 
between them was possible. He stressed, however, that political 
reform should top the agenda "since political reform must 
constitute the basis of all other reforms, providing solutions 
to other problems". 
  Murad argued political reform would spell the end of 
terrorism. "All parties condemn terrorism in all its forms, but 
the dialogue is not meant to produce a declaration of 
condemnation. We should search for ways to uproot terrorism. 
Here, the importance of political reform emerges. Once young 
people have confidence in the ballot boxes, everybody will 
respect the decisions taken by the majority, even though those 
decisions may run counter to some people's interests," Murad 
said. 
  He said the NDP's Government did advance solutions to some 
problems "but those solutions did not work as a result of other 
actions by the same party. This underlines the importance of 
political and democratic reform to create the opportunity of 
democratic change through the ballot boxes," Murad said.

<F P=106> [Statement by the Nasirite Arab Democratic Party; place and </F>
date not given] 
  [Excerpts] When our party agreed to participate in the 
national dialogue called for by the president of the republic, 
it had hopes that the dialogue would signal the revival of 
Egyptian political life and serve as the beginning of 
discussions on the basic, genuine issues of our nation with a 
view toward ending the crisis our nation has been experiencing 
for years. [passage omitted] 
  The president's decision forming the so-called committee to 
prepare for the national dialogue came as a major shock that 
immensely frustrated Egyptian political circles. The formation 
of the committee was totally contradictory to the agreement 
among the political parties. The formation of the committee was 
supposed to come as a result of consultations among the 
political parties, not a decision by the National Democratic 
Party [NDP]. 
  The overwhelming majority of the committee members are 
affiliated with the NDP, which is to blame for all the policies 
that caused the current crisis in the country. This was an 
ominous indication that its purpose is not to launch a serious 
political dialogue in which the energies of the nation are 
mobilized, creating a new hope, but to establish an elegant 
democratic facade to deceive our people at home and the world 
abroad--a facade behind which the current policies are justified. 
  It was not possible for our party to accept this fait 
accompli, especially considering that the committee includes 
some people who left their original posts a long time ago and 
devoted themselves to abusing and cursing the greatest and 
noblest symbols of our nation at the political and intellectual 
levels, and others who have dedicated their lives to defending 
Israel and Zionism. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the chairman of the 
Presidential Council, received in al-Mukalla yesterday Mr. 
Lakhdar Brahimi, the envoy of the UN secretary general, with 
whom he discussed developments affecting the situation in the 
Yemeni arena and the UN envoy's efforts to bring about the 
implementation of UN Security Council Resolution No. 924 calling 
for an immediate cease-fire and talks between the conflicting 
sides. 
  Brother al-Bid very warmly welcomed Mr. Brahimi to our 
country and expressed appreciation for the role he was 
performing toward rescuing Yemen from the calamity now 
afflicting its people. The brother chairman of the Presidential 
Council reiterated Democratic Yemen's position from which it was 
calling for an immediate cease-fire and implementation of the UN 
Security Council's resolution for the sake of the national 
interest and in response to the international will. He stressed 
that our country and people had rejected the principle of 
solving differences by resorting to arms. He briefed the UN 
envoy on the efforts made and continuing to be made by our 
political leadership to shield the Yemeni people from the 
suffering inflicted on them daily as the result of this war 
which 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and the al-Ahmar gang had imposed on 
our people. 
  For his part, Lakhdar Brahimi reiterated the hope that the 
conflicting parties would observe the cease-fire resolution. He 
also briefed the brother chairman of the Presidential Council on 
the results of his meetings with the Sanaa leadership. The 
meeting was attended by brothers Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, the 
prime minister; Muhsin Muhammad Abu-Bakr Bin-Farid, deputy prime 
minister and minister of planning and development; and 'Abdallah 
al-Asnaj, deputy prime minister and foreign minister.

report published in the French newspaper LE POINT saying that 
Iran has supplied our country with arms. 
  A statement distributed by the Iranian Embassy in Sanaa 
asserted that Iran's principled position on the current Yemeni 
developments is clear and unambiguous. This position cannot be 
distorted by these suspect media tricks. 
  The statement pointed out that Iran supports Yemeni unity 
and 
hopes that the existing problems will be resolved as part of the

  [Text] His Excellency Lakhdar Brahimi, the envoy of the UN 
secretary general, said today that he had made progress in his 
efforts to bring about a cease-fire in the war being fought in 
Yemen. He told journalists in Abu-Dhabi, as reported by 
Damascus radio, that north Yemen had accepted proposals put 
forward by our country on sending international observers to 
supervise the cease-fire. The UN secretary general's envoy went 
on to say that he had been informed of Sanaa's decision this 
evening. He said this represented a major change in the 
position of north Yemen in that it had accepted the idea of 
Yemeni and foreign observers, whereas previously Sanaa had 
rejected any foreign role. In the same context, Associated 
Press has reported that this force be formed under the 
supervision of a committee comprising 11 military members 
representing the Arab League, the United Nations and Oman, and 
two military attaches [as heard] from the United States and 
Russia. The supervisory force should comprise between 100 and 
150 officers drawn from the states represented in the 
supervisory committee. The memorandum defined the mission of 
the observers who would operate under the UN as implementing the 
cease-fire and guaranteeing the withdrawal of the forces, while 
the UN envoy was to take the necessary steps to render 
successful the mission of the force supervising the cease-fire.

  [Text] Today the foreign ministry of the recently declared 
republic in south Yemen called on the permanent members of the 
UN Security Council, as well as Arab League members, to work 
closely to ensure the formation of an acceptable team to monitor 
the cease-fire in Yemen. The team should be selected from Arab, 
African, and Asian countries and be supervised by the United 
Nations. 
  A memorandum submitted by Aden to UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, 
who is currently in Abu Dhabi, proposes that the team of 
observers be formed of officials from Algeria, Mali, Senegal, 
Malaysia, Indonesia, India, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Egypt, and 
Syria. 
  Brahimi arrived in Doha tonight from Abu Dhabi, as part of 
his efforts to stop the war in Yemen.

task would be to monitor the cease-fire. Brahimi said: I 
believe that it is a significant development that the north has 
accepted the idea of Yemenis and foreigners [monitoring the 
cease-fire]. Therefore, I think that progress has been made. 
  Brahimi added that Sanaa's decision was conveyed to him 
early 
this morning. The decision represents a significant development 
because Sanaa had previously rejected any foreign role. 
  According to a southern official, the team of observers may 
include officers representing several countries, including the 
five permanent members of the UN Security Council as well as 
Arab countries such as Syria, Egypt, Jordan, and Oman.

  [Text] A responsible source has made the following 
statement: The Government of the Republic of Yemen has been 
eager to deal with UN Security Council Resolution No. 924 out of 
its desire to end the rebellion in our country and spare the 
pure Yemeni blood. It emphasized on more than one occasion that 
its acceptance of this stems from the letter and spirit of the 
resolution, which was issued in accordance with the provisions 
and principles of the UN Charter, which guarantees the 
sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of all 
states. Accordingly, the Government of the Republic of Yemen 
pursued all possible means to entrench the cease-fire and thus 
prevent the rebels and those standing behind them from 
prolonging the conflict, shedding more Yemeni blood, and 
internationalizing an internal problem. Our people have 
encountered this problem and our valiant Armed Forces have 
foiled its aims. 
  Out of its concern to put an end to those desperate 
attempts, 
the Government of the Republic of Yemen made a fourth attempt to 
entrench the cease-fire. The Yemeni members of the military 
committee, formed by the brother chairman of the Presidential 
Council and supreme commander of the Armed Forces before the 
rebels exploded the military situation in preparation for their 
secessionist announcement, were instructed to entrench the 
cease-fire. Despite that sincere initiative, the secessionist 
rebels immediately rejected it and shamelessly demanded 
international observers in the country, to be appointed by the 
UN Security Council. They have thus disregarded the fact that 
the Government of the Republic of Yemen has on more than 
occasion categorically rejected this. 
  Concluding, the source said: News media reports said our 
country has accepted a proposal the rebels presented to brother 
Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN secretary general's fact-finding envoy. 
This proposal was immediately rejected in part and parcel 
because it is in spirit and content a flagrant violation of UN 
Security Council Resolution No. 924; it also conflicts with it 
in letter and spirit. The source added that the maximum that our 
country has expressed readiness to accept is to discuss the 
possibility of reactivating the entire joint military committee, 
formed upon a decision by the brother chairman of the 
Presidential Council and the supreme commander of the Armed 
Forces. 
  It is noteworthy that the joint military committee mentioned 
in the statement consists of six high-ranking Yemeni Armed 
Forces officers, five Jordanian officers, five Omani officers, 
the American military attache, and the French military attache.

  [Text] Sanaa, 14 Jun (MENA)--A responsible source in north 
Yemen has stressed that the Yemeni Government rejected the 
proposals that the rebels made today to Lakhdar Brahimi, UN 
envoy to Yemen. 
  In a statement broadcast here tonight, the source fully 
denied news media reports that Yemen had accepted the proposals. 
In spirit and essence, the source said, the proposals 
constitute a flagrant violation of Security Council Resolution 
No. 924, and they contradict the resolution in text and spirit, 
as the source put it. 
  The source said Yemen had announced it had accepted 
discussion on the possibility of activating a joint military 
committee, which was formed by a decision from President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih, in its full formation. The committee comprises 
six Yemeni Armed Forces officers, five Jordanian officers, five 
Omani officers, and the military attaches of France and the 
United States in Yemen. 
  It should be noted that Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, head of 
the proclaimed government in Aden, presented a proposal to 
Lakhdar Brahimi earlier today calling for the establishment of a 
team of observers drawn from a supervisory committee consisting 
of 11 military officers representing the Arab League, south 
Yemen, north Yemen, Oman, Jordan, and the military attaches of 
the United States, Russia, France, China, Britain, and a UN 
representative.

<F P=106> [Reports by Khayrallah Khayrallah in London, Sulayman Nimr </F>
and Faysal Makram in Sanaa, Iqbal 'Ali 'Abdallah in Aden, and 
Raghidah Dirgham in New York: "'Ali Salih Tells AL-HAYAH: With 
Saudi Arabia's Help We Can Achieve a Satisfactory Solution to 
the Yemeni Crisis"] 
  [Excerpt] In a statement to AL-HAYAH, Yemeni Presidential 
Council Chairman Lieutenant General 'Ali Abdallah Salih said: 
"We seek understanding with our neighbors. Our neighbors, 
especially the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, are the closest to us 
and, with their help and cooperation, we can achieve a 
satisfactory solution to the Yemeni crisis." 
  In a telephone statement to AL-HAYAH which called him from 
London, 'Ali Salih, when asked why there has been no adherence 
to the cease-fire, said: "They are the ones violating the 
cease-fire and they want international monitoring of it." Asked 
what was the solution, he replied: "Dialogue is the solution." 
He was then asked: Dialogue with whom? He replied: "With the 
elements not included in the public prosecutor's decision on 
people who are now legally wanted on the charge of committing 
crimes against the homeland. We are willing to reach 
understanding with those elements and to hold a dialogue in the 
context of the Constitution of the Yemeni Republic and the 
constant national principles." 
  It is known that the public prosecutor's decision includes 
the names of 'Ali Salim al-Bid, chairman of the Presidential 
Council of the "Democratic Republic of Yemen" and secretary 
general of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], and a number of YSP 
leaders including southern Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr 
al-'Attas and Defense Minister Brigadier General Haytham Qasim 
Tahir. 
  AL-HAYAH has learned that a parliamentary delegation 
consisting of representatives of popular and political sectors 
is making contacts to pave the way for a visit to the Kingdom of 
Saudi Arabia in the next few days. The delegation is expected 
to be headed by Yemeni House of Representatives Speaker Shaykh 
'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar. Another delegation is making 
arrangements for a tour of the rest of the Gulf Cooperation 
Council [GCC] states. 
  Meanwhile, there were reports yesterday of more military 
pressure on Aden. Lakhdar Brahimi, envoy of the UN secretary 
general, announced yesterday in Abu-Dhabi that he was discussing 
with the Yemeni leaders a compromise solution providing for the 
participation of foreign observers in supervising the cease-fire 
in Yemen. 
  Brahimi told AFP that supervision of the cease-fire could be 
done "by a joint Yemeni committee with the participation of 
foreign observers." 
  The Algerian diplomat, who is scheduled to visit Qatar and 
Jordan later on, said that the plan currently under discussion 
would provide "common grounds" that would lead to the cessation 
of the battles which have been raging in Yemen for 40 days. He 
described the plan as a "positive step" in his mission aimed at 
implementation of Security Council Resolution 924. He added 
that the plan was a compromise between the positions of Sanaa 
and Aden. 
  The Yemeni Government yesterday informed Brahimi that "the 
deployment of international observers between the government 
forces and the secessionist forces could not be discussed at 
international level as demanded by the YSP's secessionists, and 
that there was a presence of international observers in the 
framework of the Yemeni Joint Military Committee which had the 
task of stopping the military deterioration which occurred 
during the political crisis before the outbreak of the battles 
and which, in addition to Yemeni military commanders, included 
Jordanian and Omani officers as well as the U.S. and French 
charges d'affaires in Sanaa." 
  A government source in Sanaa has stated that the Yemeni 
Republic conveyed to Brahimi its acceptance of the plan for the 
formation of a Yemeni joint military committee from the two 
warring parties to supervise the cease-fire with the 
participation of foreign observers. The government source 
explained that the military committee proposed by the UN envoy 
was already in existence and had been formed with the 
participation of observers from Jordan and the Sultanate of Oman 
and some foreign attaches to embassies in Sanaa, such as the 
French and U.S. attaches. 
  The source said that urgent contacts held with Brahimi 
yesterday afternoon resulted in agreement that Sanaa would send 
representatives to a meeting with representatives of the other 
side and that Brahimi suggested Geneva or Cairo as a possible 
venue for the meeting. Sanaa is expected to name two 
representatives in the next few hours who would leave as soon as 
agreement is reached on a venue for the meeting, which would be 
held under the UN envoy's supervision. 
  The source added that, because of that agreement, Brahimi 
decided that there was no need for him to visit Sanaa again as 
suggested by the Yemeni capital yesterday morning. 
  There was increasing talk in Sanaa yesterday about a 
political solution to the crisis. Responsible sources had 
expressed the view that an agreement on the principle of 
dialogue between the two parties to the conflict on the basis of 
the proposals submitted to Envoy Brahimi when he visited Sanaa 
last week, a dialogue based on recognition of unity and 
constitutional legitimacy, would lead to an effective and 
practical cease-fire, but it seems that Brahimi insisted that 
there should first be a cease-fire before anything else. As a 
result, Sanaa responded to his request and agreed to the 
formation of the proposed cease-fire committee. 
  It seems that some elements in the Yemeni leadership are in 
favor of facilitating dialogue with the YSP leaderships without 
insistence on any conditions except that the dialogue should be 
within the framework of unity. 
  A high-ranking responsible source in Sanaa yesterday told 
AL-HAYAH that "the Yemeni Government's clarification of that 
matter, which was conveyed to the UN secretary general's envoy, 
stemmed from the decision issued by the Yemeni president on 
forming the Military Committee during the political crisis 
before the outbreak of fighting between the government forces 
and the misled forces under the command of the secessionist wing 
of the YSP." 
  The source added: "The Yemeni Government has, from the first 
weeks of the Yemeni crisis, been interested in the participation 
of military observers from fraternal and friendly states along 
with the Military Committee consisting of a number of military 
commanders from the Yemeni armed forces, because of the Yemeni 
Government's awareness of the real situation, since developments 
have demonstrated that the secessionists in the YSP had a 
premeditated plan for a bloody conflict to undermine the unity, 
security, and stability of the country." 
  In conclusion, the source said: "The Yemeni Government's 
acceptance of the presence of international observers is 
conditional on the international team being from the Joint 
Military Committee formed by a decision of Yemeni Armed Forces 
Commander in Chief President Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 
in the context of joint cooperation between the Yemeni 
Government and the Security Council for the implementation of 
Resolution 924 on the current situation in Yemen, in a way that 
would not prejudice the Yemeni Republic's sovereignty, unity, 
and democracy, and with commitment to constitutional legitimacy 
and the results of the elections held on 27 April, 1993 as a 
basis of any dialogue between the Yemeni Government and the 
YSP." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abdallah Hammudah, Hammud Munsir, Hani </F>
Naqshabandi, Taj-al-Din 'Abd-al-Haqq, and Muhammad Sadiq: "U.S. 
Warning of Disaster; Pressures To Convene Security Council"] 
  [Excerpts] London, Sanaa, Abu Dhabi, Washington, Aden, 
Cairo, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Extensive consultations are being 
conducted in the UN corridors and a number of Arab and 
international capitals to convene another Security Council 
session regarding the Yemeni war after the failure of five 
attempts to establish a cease-fire between northern and southern 
forces and Sanaa's continued refusal to deploy international 
observers in Yemen to contribute to determining which party is 
responsible for the [cease-fire] violations. [passage omitted] 
  International envoy Lakhdar Brahimi stated that he "is 
discussing with Yemeni leaders a settlement plan stipulating the 
participation of foreign observers in supervising the 
cease-fire." 
  While the southern leadership in the Democratic Republic of 
Yemen supports that and has submitted a memorandum to Brahimi 
about its plan in this connection, in which it proposed the 
participation of some 100 to 150 officers representing the 
permanent member states of the Security Council and some Arab 
states (like Syria, Egypt, Jordan, and the Sultanate of Oman), 
in addition to Yemeni officers, official sources in Sanaa said 
that they have informed Brahimi of Sanaa's agreement to revive 
the joint military committee to supervise and consolidate the 
cease-fire. 
  U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Pelletreau has 
warned of the threats posed by the continued fighting in Yemen 
to stability in the region and of the consequences and human 
disasters that may result from it. [passage omitted] 
  A north Yemen source stressed that Sanaa has not agreed 
unreservedly to the principle of bringing in international 
observers, but it replied to a proposal conveyed by Brahimi 
which says that the secessionists told him that they did not 
want the committee to be Yemeni only. So Sanaa agreed to 
re-form the joint military committee, which used to include 
northern and southern officers as well as military experts from 
the Sultanate of Oman and Jordan, in addition to the U.S. and 
French military attaches in Sanaa. 
  The northern source said that the southern leaders' proposal 
to form a team of international observers from representatives 
of the OAU, the Arab Maghreb Union, and the EC, and the 
permanent member states of the Security Council, provided it 
operates under the UN flag, is aimed at diluting the issue and 
perpetuating the concept of two separate entities. However, the 
source stressed the northern leadership's principle of holding a 
direct dialogue with southerners in Cairo or the United Nations 
before Brahimi submits his report to the UN secretary general on 
the contacts he has conducted with Yemeni leaders in Sanaa and 
al-Mukalla. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Russian Experts To Prepare Northern </F>
Air Force"] 
  [Text] London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Yemeni military 
sources have said that Russian aviation engineers have arrived 
in Sanaa recently to supervise the preparation of a squadron of 
Sukhoy fighter aircraft. 
  The information says that the five engineers who were 
granted 
entry visas to Yemen at Sanaa airport are: Alivov Aliksuvich, 
passport No. 1402266-41; Otsirnov Alikov Bigrovich, passport No. 
1402267-41; Blukhin Tsikhal Ikhliuvich, passport No. 1402265-41; 
Bgribineskiy Ginya Livovich, passport No. 1402264-41; Yamorin 
Vladimir Ivanovich, passport No. 1279750-431 [all names as 
transliterated]. 
  Aden had accused states it did not name of financing a huge 
arms deal which includes Sukhoy aircraft for Sanaa, saying that 
these arms are supplied from the former Soviet Union's arsenal 
in the Republic of Uzbekistan. 
  Information obtained by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT says that Colonel 
Muhammad Salih al-Ahmar, half brother of the Yemeni president 
and commander of the Air Force and Air Defense, was behind the 
official invitation sent to the five Russian engineers, as 
mentioned in the original version of the invitation document 
sent by the General Staff in Sanaa. 
  Sources say that Yemeni Embassy officials in Moscow pointed 
out to the Russian experts that there was no means of transport 
to Sanaa as a result of the fighting, but the experts surprised 
Yemeni diplomats by saying they would go to Sanaa by a special 
plane -- which confirms the existence of direct contacts between 
Sanaa and the Russian experts without the Yemeni Embassy's 
knowledge. The sources add that northern military [officials] 
visit Tashkent to purchase various types of weapons, especially 
fighter aircraft.

  [Text] Rawalpindi -- President Farooq Leghari said Monday 
that Prithvi is country-specific to Pakistan like the Pressler 
Amendment and even more alarming is India's missile programme. 
  Addressing the convocation of the National Defence College 
(NDC), Leghari said: "The Agni threatens a vast region, from 
China and south East Asia to Kazakhstan, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. 
India's acquisition of cryogenic engines provides it a licence 
to acquire ICBM [Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile] 
capability. Other countries of the region cannot sit back 
complacently while India acquires a potential stanglehold over 
them." 
  He said: "It was not enough for us to be told that India 
will 
promise not to deploy Prithivis. How long does it take to 
actually deploy those mobile launched missiles, 12 hours, 24 
hours?. 
  "Our region must be saved from a missile race. Unless we 
settle for a zero-missile regime in the region, the race will 
become inevitable. The US and Russia must act positively now 
and restrain India," he demanded. 
  Leghari said: "In response to our security imperatives, we 
also seek self-reliance and indigenisation in our country in 
general and defence production in particular. Import of high 
tech equipment from abroad is not only a heavy drain on our 
economy, but also subjects us to a high degree of uncertainty." 
  "We have learnt that no nation can expect to be truly 
sovereign if it is totally dependent on others for import of 
arms and technology. 
  The President urged that Pakistan must plan its 
indigenisation effort with vision and follow it with the resolve 
to stand on its own feet as early as possible.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "America's Half-Hearted Reaction"] </F>
  [Text] Pakistan has described the U.S. reaction to the 
Indian Prithvi missile test as half-hearted and said that this 
action will encourage India to extend the missile race in South 
Asia. The United States asked Pakistan and India last year to 
stop the manufacture, acquisition, and testing of missiles in 
South Asia. Pakistan accepted the U.S. advice, but India did not 
respond. The issue was once again raised when Strobe Talbott, 
the U.S. deputy secretary of state, visited the region in April. 
  India then postponed the Prithvi missile test just before 
Narasimha Rao's visit to the United States. However, as soon as 
Rao concluded the visit, India test fired the missile and made 
it clear to the whole world, including the United States, that 
it is free to deal with its own matters without regard to the 
advice of the United States or any other country. The U.S. 
reaction to India's attitude is not only half-hearted, but also 
superfluous. As far as Pakistan's nuclear program is concerned, 
it has been clearly pointed out to the United States that 
Pakistan will not accept any unilateral decision in this regard. 
Amazingly, India pays no attention to U.S. advice, nor does it 
care about world public opinion on the nuclear issue or on 
missile production. This arrogance is leading to a lack of 
balance of power and is causing concern and apprehension among 
the smaller countries in the region.

  [Text] Responding to a question regarding a news report 
published in a local English daily alleging the expulsion of two 
Pakistani diplomats from Germany, a Foreign Office spokesman 
said in Islamabad today that the report by German television was 
factually incorrect. No Pakistani diplomat has been expelled 
from Germany as asserted in the report. The spokesman said 
Pakistan is procuring a number of sophisticated items of [as 
heard] equipment from various sources. Normally, it is for 
supplier companies to obtain export license for restricted 
items. For its part, Pakistan seeks to scrupulously observe the 
export laws of the concerned countries. He said the report 
appears to be an attempt to sensationalize normal transactions.

  [Text] A report from Pakistan says orders have been issued 
for the arrest of former prime minister, Mr. Nawaz Sharif. An 
agency quoting the governor of Punjab Province, Mr. Altaf 
Hussain, said that the permission of the Speaker of the National 
Assembly has been sought in this regard. Two members of the 
provincial assembly of Punjab belonging to Pakistan Muslim 
League -- Nawaz Group, have already been arrested in a case of 
allotment of plots scandal. 
  Meanwhile, the Pakistan president, Mr. Farooq Ahmad Khan 
Leghari, has initiated legal proceedings against Mr. Nawaz 
Sharif for accusing him of making huge amounts of money by 
hoarding cotton bales. This was disclosed by Mr. Leghari in 
Rawalpindi yesterday. He said that he will sue Mr. Nawaz Sharif 
on another count also.

  [Text] Mohammad Nawaz Sharif, leader of the opposition in 
the National Assembly, has filed a constitutional petition with 
the Lahore High Court in which he requested that the provincial 
government be restrained from filing cases against him. 
  A spokesman for the Governor's House in Lahore has rejected 
reports on the possible arrest of opposition leader Mian 
Mohammad Nawaz Sharif. He said that the provincial governor had 
given no interview to the GULF NEWS as was reported; therefore, 
the reports are baseless, fabricated, and speculative.

  [Excerpts] Our country's foreign minister, who is in 
Germany at present, met the German foreign minister today to 
discuss bilateral relations and regional and international 
issues. We draw your attention to our correspondent's report 
from Bonn. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Foreign Affairs Minister 'Ali 
Akbar Velayati met and conferred with German Foreign Minister 
Klaus Kinkel. In this meeting, which lasted for over two hours, 
bilateral relations in various fields, the expansion of economic 
ties between the two countries, as well as regional and 
international issues were discussed. [passage omitted] 
  At the end of the meeting, the German foreign minister took 
part in an interview with the Voice and Vision of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran correspondent, and considered the talks as 
positive and constructive. 
  Our country's foreign minister also spoke to us at the 
conclusion of the meeting. Referring to the outcome of his 
talks, he said: 
  [Begin Velayati recording] In the name of God, the merciful, 
the compassionate. The meeting with his excellency Mr. Kinkel 
was very positive and constructive. In this long meeting we 
discussed and reviewed relations between Iran and Germany in 
various areas. One of the key topics for our discussion was our 
bilateral cooperation during the forthcoming term of German 
presidency of the European Union. It was decided that such 
cooperation should take a more serious aspect once Germany 
assumes the EU presidency. In view of the fact that after 
Germany, France, and then Spain take over the presidency of the 
EU, we seek to give a more positive tone to our talks with these 
three countries. In today's meeting, however, we decided to 
hold meetings during the forthcoming UN General Assembly in New 
York between the foreign ministers of the said countries and the 
ECO [Economic Cooperation Organization] member countries. 
  Cultural and economic cooperation between Iran and Germany 
will be pursued in a better and more positive way from now on. 
Mr. Kinkel is busy with elections right now, and we hope that 
the present German Government can continue and enhance its 
future cooperation with the Islamic Republic of Iran and the 
countries of our region, especially the ECO members. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Tehran, June 14, IRNA -- The Islamic Republic of 
Iran has pardoned German spy Helmut Szimkus, who had been 
arrested here in 1989. 
  Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati in his meeting with 
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn informed him of the pardon. 
  Szimkus had been condemned to death by a court after his 
trial. 
  German Chancellor Kohl and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel had 
previously appealed for the Szimkus' release. 
  A diplomatic source said after the appeal, related 
authorities reviewed the case in light of the principled and 
realistic stances of the Bonn government vis-a-vis Iran, and 
Szimkus was eventually pardoned. 
  His pardon is expected to open a new chapter in Tehran-Bonn 
relations despite the impediments made by the U.S. and Britain.

  [Text] Tehran, June 14, IRNA -- The Iranian Embassy in 
Sanaa today categorically refuted as "false" a report by a 
french magazine that Iran had proposed to despatch units from 
the Islamic Revolution's Gurads Corps (IRGC) to Yemen. 
  Referring the recent 'LE POINT' allegations, the embassy 
said 
such unfounded reports and commentaries are printed in some 
Western papers with "quite clear objectives." 
  The embassy in its statement said Iran's clear stance 
concerning the current developments in the brotherly Republic of 
Yemen cannot be misportrayed through such propaganda. 
  The Islamic Republic of Iran supports a united Yemen, and 
hopes that present disputes would be settled peacefully, it said. 
  "National sovereignty and non-intervention in the internal 
affairs of Yemen should be respected in any solution," the 
statement said.

  [Text] President Hashemi-Rafsanjani received Kenyan 
Attorney General Amos Wako this morning. After giving Mr. 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani a written message from the Kenyan president, 
the Kenyan attorney general described the outcome of his 
meetings with our country's judicial officials as very fruitful. 
  Thanking Iran for its efforts in the fight against narcotics 
and for observing human rights standards, he called for more 
cooperation and consultation regarding the sharing of Iran's 
invaluable experience with his country. 
  Thanking Iran for its foreign policy on establishing and 
expanding ties with the Third World, especially African 
countries, he described as very important and effective the role 
of our country's officials in global developments. He said: 
Since the victory of the Islamic revolution, as a big regional 
and Islamic power, Iran has played an active role in defending 
the rights of the innocent and the deprived throughout the 
world. He called for the expansion of mutual ties in all fields. 
  According to a Central News Unit report, President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani expressed regret that monopolistic countries 
pursue their hegemonistic policy in the world by resorting to 
holy concepts. He said: The cruelty and harshness of those 
powers are known throughout history, and there is strong 
evidence of their disregard for human rights. They try to 
accuse developing countries and countries seeking independence 
of human rights violations. 
  He said: Using their capabilities, since they possess rich 
natural and human resources, Third World countries could, 
through cooperation--directly and without middlemen--help each 
other in solving their problems. 
  Expressing concern about the bitter events in Africa, 
particularly the events in Somalia, Rwanda, Angola, and 
Mozambique, the president called for more effort by the 
Organization of African Unity to end the crisis in that region. 
  He expressed the hope that relations between Iran and Kenya 
would be expanded in all fields.

  [Text] Tehran, June 14, IRNA -- OPEC should postpone its 
September meeting in a bid to boost the oil prices, Oil Minister 
Gholam Reza Aqazadeh said here Tuesday. 
  Referring to the OPEC oil ministers meeting in Vienna on 
Wednesday, Aqazadeh told the Persian daily ETTELA'AT that Iran 
would support every proposal which tended to help boost the 
prices. 
  He said the meeting has two important topics in its agenda, 
namely selection of the future secretary general of OPEC, and 
determination of the OPEC production ceiling. 
  On the former topic, he said there were two candidates from 
Iran and Venezuela for the post, and that from historical and 
qualitative points of view iran considered it its to be selected 
as the next OPEC secretary general. 
  Elsewhere, he said since Iran and Saudi Arabia produce half 
of the OPEC oil output, adoption of a joint stance by the two 
countries would certainly help OPEC to make a firm decision. 
  "Experience has shown that the two countries' agreement has 
had great impact on strengthening the prices," he noted.

<F P=106> [Commentary by the News Research and Commentaries Group] </F>
  [Text] The petroleum ministers of the 12 OPEC 
member-countries are to meet in Vienna today to decide on ways 
to strengthen the oil market and to determine the production 
ceiling for the next three months. Also on the OPEC agenda are 
discussions for the election of a new OPEC secretary general, 
and changing the headquarters of the OPEC Secretariat. 
  What is gleaned from the comments by the OPEC members' 
ministers before the commencement of the session is that an 
atmosphere of tranquility and understanding exists among the 
OPEC members on improving the oil market; and in this 
encouraging atmosphere, OPEC is expected to set the production 
ceiling at 24.5 million barrels per day and to display its 
determination on OPEC's uniformity in improving oil prices. 
  It should be noted that during OPEC's recent session held in 
March this year, members set the production ceiling at 24.52 
million barrels per day for 1994 in a bid to prevent a drop in 
oil prices and committed themselves to help the stability of the 
oil market by observing the set production ceilings. 
  Also, the drop in oil prices stopped two months ago and a 
relative improvement was observed in the international oil 
market. On the basis of figures published by oil sources, there 
has been a $3-$4 increase in the price of each barrel of oil 
over the past two months. Although this is encouraging, it is 
still a far cry from the basic OPEC price which is $21 per 
barrel. 
  Experts believe that the major reason for increased oil 
demand during the past months is renewed economic growth in the 
industrial world and the West's storing of oil for its fall and 
winter fuel needs. This increase in demand by major consumers 
and the observance of the OPEC ceiling production and oil supply 
have led to an improvement in world oil prices. 
  Informed oil circles believe that the OPEC members that 
depend on their oil income as the major source of foreign 
exchange income, have lost billions of dollars because of the 
drop in oil prices during the past months. Therefore, in order 
to safeguard the interests of OPEC and of the members in this 
important international organization, it is necessary to improve 
oil prices and to increase them to $21-per barrel. Now, on the 
eve of the 96th OPEC session, it seems that the atmosphere of 
understanding among members, controlling the production ceiling 
and the commitment of member countries to observe production 
ceilings will be an attainable objective. 
  At any rate, the Islamic Republic of Iran welcomes any step 
by OPEC that will lead to an increase in the prices of crude 
oil, and in its oil policy it underlines the need for OPEC's 
power, understanding among members, and the safeguarding of this 
organization's interests.

  [Text] Tehran, 3 Farvardin [19 April] KEYHAN News Service 
-- 'Abbas 'Abdi, editor in chief of the newspaper SALAM, who was 
arrested early in the month of Shahrivar [23 August-22 September 
1993] and was sentenced on 1 Dey [22 December] at the 
revolutionary court to one year in prison and 40 lashes in 
suspension, was released on a bond payment of 10 million tumans. 
  The newspaper SALAM made the point that 'Abdi has served 10 
months of his sentence and only four months remain, and that 
taking a 10-million-tuman bond to free him is not appropriate 
for the remaining time. It regarded this as a violation of 
judicial procedure. 
  During the month of Dey [22 December 1993-20 January 1994], 
concurrent with the issuance of the sentence punishing 'Abdi and 
the press discussions concerning the nature of his crime, the 
deputy minister of guidance for press affairs said: The charges 
against 'Abbas 'Abdi are not press related.

  [Text] Tehran, 24 Ordibehesht [14 May] KEYHAN-E HAVA'I News 
Service -- White House officials are continuing their policy of 
frightening the region's leaders and talking to the region's 
oil-rich nations about the threat from Iran, for the purpose of 
selling them more American weapons. 
  In this same connection, Robert Pelletreau, the American 
assistant Secretary of State, said while visiting the southern 
Persian Gulf nations: "We believe Iran intends to arm itself 
with modern weapons in the shortest time possible." Speaking 
with reporters before departing from Bahrain for Kuwait, he 
added: "We have consulted and exchanged views with our friends 
in the region concerning the threat from Iran to the Arab 
emirates." 
  Pelletreau spoke of the threat from Iran and this country's 
becoming equipped with advanced weaponry at a time when the 
Islamic Republic of Iran's military budget is insignificant 
compared to the budgets of many of the countries in the region, 
including the emirates in the south Persian Gulf. 
  It is worth mentioning that one of the ways Western 
companies, including American companies, sell chemical weapons 
to the Arab nations, is to claim that Iran is a threat to the 
security of the aforementioned countries, and that if the Arab 
nations of the Persian Gulf do not become equipped with advanced 
weaponry, they might be attacked by the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  In his press conference he claimed that Iran continues to 
threaten the oil-rich Arab nations of the Persian Gulf. America 
is now holding talks and negotiations with the Arabs to increase 
their defense and deterrent capability. 
  It is to be noted that Iran has repeatedly opposed American 
opportunism in the region and the White House goal of 
strengthening its domination of the Persian Gulf. Iranian 
officials have emphasized that establishing security depends on 
cooperation among the Persian Gulf nations and removing 
foreigners from this region.

  [Text] Cairo, 10 Jun (MENA)--Muhammad Mu'tasim Hakim, 
spokesman for the Sudanese opposition Democratic Unionist Party 
[DUP], has denied newspaper reports that Sudanese opposition 
radio will transmit programs from Cairo. 
  In a statement to MENA, he said that Sudanese opposition has 
never thought of setting up a radio in Egypt or in any other 
Arab country to beam at Sudan. 
  He asserted that the Sudanese opposition is eager to improve 
relations between Egypt and Sudan and that opposition radio will 
transmit in the coming days from an undisclosed location. He 
explained that the transmission will be for two hours daily, one 
hour in the morning and one in the evening. He added that the 
broadcast will contain programs for the Sudanese people to 
uncover the Islamic front's plots in Sudan. 
  He said the radio will be called "The Opposition National 
Democratic Grouping Radio." He added that the grouping consists 
of the DUP led by Muhammad 'Uthman al-Mirghani, the Ummah Party, 
the Popular Movement led by Colonel John Garang, the southern 
parties, the Sudanese Communist Party, the Sudanese National

said that a political solution that could bypass a referendum in 
Western Sahara is possible. Asked to be more precise, the

solution would be a structure which would accommodate the

<F P=106> [Report by 'Adnan Husayn: "Barzani and Talabani Meet in </F>
Silopi, Turkey"] 
  [Excerpt] London -- In a surprise step, the two Iraqi 
Kurdish leaders Mas'ud Barzani and Jalal Talabani moved to 
Turkey yesterday and held a bilateral meeting in the city of 
Silopi near the border with Iraq. Kurdish sources have told 
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the meeting, in which Turkish military 
and security officials participated, was arranged by Ankara. 
  Iraqi opposition sources see the meeting as evidence of the 
difficulties still facing the two Kurdish leaders regarding 
normalizing conditions in north Iraq after the fighting that 
broke out between Barzani's party and Talabani's party. Sources 
from the opposition "[Unified] Iraqi National Congress" told 
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT over the telephone from the congress' offices 
in the Kurdish city of Salah al-Din that the Turks are 
interested particularly in consolidating the reconciliation 
between the two Kurdish leaders and preventing fighting from 
breaking out between them again. Fighting would affect security 
conditions on the border area between Iraq and Turkey, which 
Ankara says is being used as a staging post for attacks against 
the Turkish forces stationed in the mainly Kurdish southeastern 
provinces by the separatist Workers' Party of Kurdistan, which 
is launching a guerrilla war against the Turkish state.

  [Text] Dear citizens: We will broadcast the report on the 
al- Sulaymaniyah massacres, adding the latest information on the 
shooting of defenseless civilians by the forces of the Patriotic 
Union of Kurdistan [PUK] on Monday, 13 June, during a peaceful 
procession to lay to rest the body of martyr 'Uthman Qadir 
Munawwar, member of the working committee of the fourth branch 
of our party, [Kurdistan Democratic Party] and the commander of 
the al- Sulaymaniyah region in the Ministry of the Peshmergas 
Affairs. 
  We have received additional information that the number of 
demonstrators reached into the hundreds of thousands, raising 
slogans praising our party and reiterating the genuineness of 
this Kurdish city. Many of the girls and women of 
al-Sulaymaniyah, who were leading the peaceful procession, were 
martyred, and hundreds, including a large number of women, were 
wounded. 
  Yesterday, the PUK continued to chase and arrest the 
citizens 
who took part in the procession or those suspected of being 
loyal to our party. The most serious issue is that the life of 
those under arrest is in danger. We now appeal to the friends 
of our people, world public opinion, the United Nations, the 
Kurdistan Front forces, the Iraqi opposition, and personalities 
to intervene swiftly to save the lives of the thousands under 
arrest, to release them immediately, and to respect the 
processions during which at least 51 martyrs will be laid to 
rest.

  [Text] Baghdad, 15 Jun (INA)--The Autonomous Region in 
Iraqi Kurdistan is witnessing fierce battles, chaos, and lack of 
security under the alleged protection provided by the 30-state 
alliance and the support of the Iranian regime and some regional 
and international quarters. 
  In a report published today, AL-JUMHURIYAH quoted Kurdish 
citizens as saying that after the two-week bloody battles, the 
groups of Mas'ud Barzani control the areas of Banjwin and Qal'at 
Dizah. Iranian helicopters participated in these battles in 
accordance with an agreement Barzani concluded with the 
so-called Islamic Movement in Iraqi Kurdistan and the so-called 
Hizballah Party Shur Shkanri Kurd [name as transliterated] led 
by Adham Barzani and Shaykh Muhammad Khalid, son-in-law of 
Mas'ud Barzani. 
  The newspaper said that in these clashes and liquidation 
operations 65 people of Talabani's group and 11 armed men of 
Barzani's group were killed, in addition to the hundreds who 
were injured on both sides. The heavy fighting in Banjwin and 
Qal'at Dizah forced citizens to escape the shells that 
haphazardly fell on their houses. 
  The newspaper added that the so-called Democratic Party of 
Kurdistan, which controls these two areas, issued a stern 
warning to fleeing citizens that their houses will be demolished 
and property confiscated if they do not return to their homes 
and bow to the orders of his group. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH said it has information that a few days ago 
Iranian helicopters raided the area of Qahlajulan, where the 
headquarters and residence of agent Jalal Talabani are located. 
These helicopters also raided Banjwin, Qal'at Dizah, and the 
villages of Banqahlah and Ramaw, which are controlled by 
Talabani's group. 
  A huge demonstration was staged from Salah-al-Din University 
a few days ago in which thousands of students participated to 
protest the crimes of the war of liquidation in which innocent 
people are victimized by the hate and vengeance of the Jalal 
Talabani and Mas'ud Barzani groups, whose statements show their 
inability to reach an understanding.

  [Text] Baghdad, 10 Jun (INA)--The newspaper AL-THAWRAH has 
stressed that the mean letter U.S. President Clinton has sent to 
the Congress, and the fallacies it contains, is evidence of the 
hidden rancor that stems from a political mentality devoid of 
any values of political credibility. 
  In an article entitled "U.S. Fallacies," the paper says: 
Clinton claimed that Iraq has not responded to the UN Security 
Council resolutions and is working against them. Here, we have 
the right to ask: How can this opinion fit in with the 
acknowledgments and credits given by the United Nations and some 
UN Security Council members, who agreed that Iraq has made 
positive, important, and basic steps in dealing with the UN 
resolutions? 
  The paper adds: We think Clinton has seen the periodic 
reports by Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the UN Special Commission, in 
which he clearly noted the positive Iraqi position in dealing 
with the UN resolutions; nor do we think Clinton is unaware of 
what International Atomic Energy Agency officials say, 
especially since the UN Security Council halls are not very far 
from the U.S. capital, Washington. 
  The paper explains that the only credible thing for the 
United States to do in order to confirm its objectivity and 
sound judgment is to hold the Security Council responsible for 
the delay in implementing Clause 22 of Resolution 687 and not 
deny what Iraq had achieved. 
  The paper says: What Clinton claimed, to the effect that the 
positions of all UN Security Council members on Iraq are united 
and identical, should be denounced. If he is concerned about 
accurate analysis, then he should acknowledge the changes that 
have taken place. 
  The paper wonders: Why did Clinton, in his letter, ignore 
what the Russians, French, and Chinese -- all permanent UN 
Security Council members -- have said about the need for the UN 
Security Council to change the way it is dealing with Iraq, 
following the great strides that have been made? Why did he 
ignore the opinion of the vast majority of the Security Council 
non-permanent members who called for lifting the blockade 
imposed on Iraq? 
  The paper says: Why did Clinton neglect the state of 
apprehension and concern his envoy to the UN Security Council 
was in while she was trying to promote her arguments, with 
feeble help from the British envoy, in the recent Council 
deliberations. 
  The paper concludes by saying: What Clinton has said is 
absolutely untrue and runs counter to the truth. It is a cheap 
attempt to jump to conclusions and deceive world public opinion 
into believing unfounded conceptions. If the U.S. 
Administration has made lies its daily political commodity, then 
it will certainly be a rotten commodity that cannot survive in 
the face of facts.

  [Text] Beirut, June 14 (AFP) -- Lebanon on Tuesday 
dismissed a claim attributed to a Palestinian activist that he 
had placed the bomb which exploded on a US airliner over 
Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988. 
  Yusuf Sha'ban "never said that he had placed the bomb in the 
Pan Am plane" that killed 270 people, state prosecutor Munif 
'Uwaydat told AFP. 
  "But he said that under torture he was ready to confess to 
anything, even the Lockerbie bombing, if asked to," 'Uwaydat 
said, noting Sha'ban's comments were not logged in court records 
because they were not connected to his trial. 
  The state prosecutor charged that statements attributed to 
Sha'ban on Monday were "deformed on purpose to embarrass 
(Lebanese) justice," and he ruled out any investigation into the 
claim. 
  Sha'ban, according to the state-run news agency ANI, told a 
court here that he was responsible for bombing the plane. 
  The 29-year-old member of Abu-Nidal's hardline Fatah 
Revolutionary Council (FRC) was being heard in the murder trial 
of Jordanian diplomat Na'ib 'Umran al-Ma'ayitah who was shot 
dead outside his Beirut home in January. 
  Sha'ban faces a possible death penalty. 
  The United States said it had no evidence to corroborate 
Sha'ban's claim and reiterated its demand for the extradition of 
two Libyans who have been indicted in both Britain and the 
United States for the attack. 
  Barbara Bodine, the State Department coordinator on 
counter-terrorism, said that Sha'ban "was not a suspect." 
  "We feel very strong evidence against the two indicted 
Libyans, but we are serious in following up this lead to see if 
there is any veracity in it at all," Bodine said. 
  London and Washington have for three years been trying to 
force court appearances of 'Abd-Basit al-Mijrahi and Al-Amin 
Khalifah Fahimah, who are charged in the bombing. 
  Britain also renewed its demand that the two Libyans be 
brought before a Scottish or a US court to answer the charges. 
  Al-Mijrahi and Fahimah's Libyan lawyer, meanwhile, sent a 
letter to the Lebanese judicial authorities urging them to 
further interrogate Sha'ban on the Lockerbie bombing. 
  Ibrahim Legwell asked that lawyers defending the Libyan 
suspects be allowed to take part in any investigation, according 
to a copy of the letter received by AFP in Tripoli. 
  Libya has been under UN sanctions since April 1992 because 
of 
its refusal to hand over the two suspects. The sanctions cut 
international air links and arms sales, and limited diplomatic 
ties with Libya.

  [Text] 'Allamah Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah believes that 
the peace settlement in the region is not moving quickly. 
  'Allamah Fadallah, in his answer to questions during a 
lesson 
on the Koran, said: "This stage revolves round the 
Lebanese-Syrian- Israeli negotiations. The Syrian-Israeli 
negotiations revolve round two contrary demands because Israel 
wants to normalize relations first, then establish diplomatic 
relations and security, and then withdraw in stages over eight 
years. On the other hand, Syria wants withdrawal first, then 
the establishment of diplomatic relations. It wants 
normalization to be left up to circumstances. 
  Fadlallah believes that the objective of Israeli attacks on 
Lebanon is to put pressure on the Syrian-Lebanese stand and the 
mujahidin, and to create new issues over which negotiations can 
take place to delay the basic negotiating issues. This is 
especially true since Israel is monitoring Palestinian autonomy 
and working on finalizing the autonomy negotiations over the 
West Bank. This prevents it from moving in two directions. 
Therefore, we believe that Israel wants to play upon the time 
factor--perhaps wait for some changes from one party, or some 
pressures from another party. It seems that the United States 
still falls in line with Israeli policy. We believe, therefore, 
that settlement will not take place very quickly. 
  Answering a question, Fadlallah said: We do not trust the 
PLO and we have in our possession some documents on relations 
between the PLO and Israel since 1982. We know that the PLO 
used to make things easy for many European intelligence agencies 
and give them opportunities. They used to offer them a great 
deal of information about the Islamists in Lebanon and about 
many of those groups opposing Western policies in the region. 
Therefore, we fear the Israeli-Palestinian agreement in the 
region. We fear that the Palestinian officials will cooperate 
and coordinate with Israeli intelligence to strike the Islamic 
and liberation movements in the region. We also fear that the 
autonomy agreement will constitute a bridge for the Israelis to 
cross into Arab economy using the Palestinian element which 
could be a cover behind which the Israeli element hides. 
  As regards Israeli threats, 'Allamah Fadlallah believes that 
"there are no Israeli, American, or Arab circumstances that 
provide Israel with the opportunity to do what it did last year 
or to occupy new Lebanese territory. The whole issue is that 
Israel is working on planning qualitative strikes, either 
security or military, every now and then because it fears the 
reaction of the Islamic Resistance."

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri by Dino </F>
Frescobaldi in Beirut; date not given: "Beirut: Prime Minister 
Accuses Italy: `Ambassador Causing Us Trouble'"] 
  [Excerpt] Beirut -- [passage omitted] [Frescobaldi] What 
happened to all the old militiamen who belonged to and were 
obedient to the warlords? 
  [Al-Hariri] They have been integrated into the system. Their 
leaders have handed over their weapons. Now there is a single 
army of 50,000 men, partly volunteers and partly draftees, 
within which the representatives of those armed groupings 
account for no more than 10 percent, which is answerable to a 
single defense minister and which is obedient to the Council of 
Ministers and the national Parliament. 
  [Frescobaldi] What role do you think a new Lebanon can 
perform in the region? 
  [Al-Hariri] First, a role as a catalyst in finance, trade, 
and the promotion of light industry, which are its traditional 
tasks. But also a role in stimulating culture and advancing 
democracy on the basis of its own experiences. I can cite 
evidence of this. In recent days we held the funerals of the 
victims of the latest bombardments -- outright massacres. There 
were tens of thousands of people there, but not a single shot 
was fired. Everything went calmly. This means that people no 
longer want anything more to do with trouble, and that they 
respect the power of the state, the police, and the Army. 
  [Frescobaldi] In this situation a threat could nevertheless 
stem from Islamic fundamentalism. 
  [Al-Hariri] I will answer you with a question: In a country 
where tourism is so important to everyone -- as are finance, 
culture, and openness to the world, for that matter -- in a 
multi-confessional country comprising both Christians and 
Muslims, what kind of role do you think the fundamentalists 
could have? Merely a trouble-making role. The fact is that the 
fundamentalists have no future in Lebanon, even if they may 
receive help from here and there. The majority of Lebanese have 
now converted to moderation. 
  [Frescobaldi] We must not forget that this is taking place 
against the background of an overall peace process. How 
optimistic are you in this regard? 
  [Al-Hariri] Let me tell you that the Arabs have decided to 
make peace and are ready in this regard. Now it is up to Israel 
to decide. It must decide what its role is to be in the region. 
If the Israelis want to be dominators, it means that they will 
have many problems. If, however, they want to be a country that 
lives in peace with its neighbors, then I think peace is very 
near. And with regard to the 12 percent of our territory that 
is occupied, it must be returned to us to the very last inch. 
  [Frescobaldi] So can we talk in terms of a miracle in 
connection with Lebanon? 
  [Al-Hariri] Why not? We are one of the few countries whose 
currency is not only stable but is also growing stronger, albeit 
not by much. Where investments are flowing in from all over the 
Arab world, where the private sector is forging ahead. As for 
the Europeans, they come here to work; to sign contracts; to 
sell supplies, especially for construction; and to bring 
know-how. 
  [Frescobaldi] What does Italy do? 
  [Al-Hariri] It too is taking part. It has concluded a good 
contract in the electrical field. As for your ambassador, he is 
causing us... [Al-Hariri ends] 
  [Frescobaldi] The interview ended here because al-Hariri 
made 
me switch off the tape recorder. But he made me understand that 
the Lebanese Government would not be displeased if the 
ambassador were to be replaced.

  [Excerpt] UN envoy to Yemen Lakhdar Brahimi arrived in 
Amman early this morning after holding intensive contacts on the 
Yemeni crisis with the involved parties and with a number of 
regional leaders over the past two days. Meanwhile, the Yemeni 
Government announced its categorical rejection of the 
secessionist leadership's proposal to dispatch international 
observers to monitor a cease-fire in Yemen. More details in the 
following report: 
  In an arrival statement in Amman, Brahimi said that talks 
now 
focus on a proposed working mechanism for the Yemenis to agree 
on to entrench a cease-fire, in addition to many proposed ideas. 
He noted that there is another proposal to activate the work of 
the joint military committee, adding that both parties agreed to 
it. However, he said, no agreement has been reached so far on 
the nature of the committee's work or its formation, expressing 
his belief that there are no differences over the participation 
of Jordan and Oman in this committee. Brahimi said: Both 
parties to the conflict agreed on the Security Council 
resolution, a cease-fire, and the principle of dialogue. He 
added that the United Nations supports any agreement between the 
two parties. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Ladies and gentlemen: A short while ago, we learned 
that Lieutenant General Dr. Samir Farraj, the private physician 
of His Majesty King Husayn, has stated that his majesty the king 
left the Mayo Clinic medical center in Rochester in the United 
States this morning after undergoing extensive medical tests. 
The medical tests have shown that his majesty the king is 
enjoying good health, and that there are no traces of the 
disease which prompted surgery for his majesty the king two 
years ago. Consequently, such tests will be conducted once per 
year, instead of once every six months, Dr. Farraj added.

  [Text] Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali left 
Amman [for Washington] this afternoon to join his Majesty King 
Husayn. 
  In a press statement at Queen Alia Airport prior to his 
departure, Dr. al-Majali said that the summit due to be held 
between His Majesty King Husayn and U.S. President Bill Clinton 
is important. He added that during this summit, the two leaders 
will discuss the means of promoting and enhancing Jordanian-U.S. 
ties, regional developments, and international issues. Dr. 
al-Majali went on to say: They will also discuss the most 
recent developments in the peace process, particularly those 
relating to the Jordanian track of negotiations, as well as the 
negotiations on the other tracks, especially the Syrian and 
Lebanese tracks of negotiations, because we believe that the 
negotiations on these tracks should see progress. Jordan's firm 
position underscores the need for a comprehensive solution. He 
noted that the progress made on one track is also good for the 
other tracks of negotiations. 
  On inter-Arab coordination at this phase, the prime minister 
said: The concept of coordination is not being seriously 
observed. The level of inter-Arab coordination has not risen to 
the desired levels. He indicated that coordination among the 
Arab sides engaged in the peace process has continued to take 
place whenever there is an opportunity to do so. He added that 
whenever new developments occur, the other parties are informed 
of this. He noted that this is done constantly. 
  With regard to the issue of al-'Aqabah, Dr. al-Majali said 
that the Jordanian Government is about to sign a deal in this 
regard with Lloyds Register. He noted that there is a minor 
problem hampering this, and that this minor problem is about to 
be resolved. 
  The prime minister was seen off at the airport by Deputy 
Prime Minister Dhuqan al-Hindawi, several cabinet ministers, the 
chief of Public Security, and several other officials.

  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali left 
Amman for Washington today to join His Majesty King Husayn on 
his U.S. visit, during which he will meet with U.S. President 
Bill Clinton. Dr. al-Majali was seen off by Deputy Prime 
Minister Dhuqan al-Hindawi and several cabinet ministers. 
  On His Majesty King Husayn's Washington visit, Dr. al-Majali 
spoke to [Salim 'Ali Dhiyab], our correspondent for political 
affairs: 
  [Begin recording] [Al-Majali] Undoubtedly, there must be 
constant reconsideration of Jordanian-U.S. ties to further 
promote and strengthen them in the interest of the American and 
Jordanian peoples. The summit between his majesty the king and 
President Clinton constitutes a peak in these ties, which we 
know to be special. This summit will remove any of the 
difficulties that might have emerged along the path of these 
good ties, which continue to be promoted. [passage omitted] 
  [Dhiyab] Dr. al-Majali: With regard to inter-Arab 
coordination, I do not want to ask you whether you are satisfied 
with it. But, how strong is it at present? 
  [Al-Majali] As a matter of fact, the word coordination 
continues to be misunderstood. Coordination is not seriously 
observed, as we wish. We understand coordination to mean that 
each party is properly and unambiguously informed of the 
position of the other party. If the two parties agree on 
certain issues, that would be fine and great. But if the two 
parties disagree, this should not mean that there is a dispute. 
For each party must respect the other's view. This is how 
coordination should be viewed. It is regrettable that 
inter-Arab coordination has not reached the desired level. 
  [Dhiyab] But, in practical terms, is there currently 
coordination among the three Arab sides? 
  [Al-Majali] Of course. Coordination has remained intact. 
Coordination has remained an ongoing process. Whenever there is 
an opportunity, coordination takes place. Nonetheless, people 
do not meet all the time. Whenever there are new developments, 
the other parties are informed of them, and consequently these 
developments are discussed. This is what always takes place.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali </F>
by Shakir al-Jawhari in Amman on 13 June; "published in AL-ASWAQ 
in coordination with al-Shariqah AL-KHALIJ newspaper"] 
  [Text] [al-Jawhari] Mr. Prime Minister, you will leave for 
Washington tomorrow [14 June] to join his majesty the king on 
his visit to the United States. Would you brief us on the 
agenda of your talks in the American capital? 
  [Al-Majali] We have a joint Jordanian-U.S. committee to 
discuss all issues related to bilateral relations. This 
committee always meets at this time in the presence of his 
majesty the king in Washington to strengthen relations and 
resolve any pending issues between Jordan and the United States. 
  [Al-Jawhari] Are there currently any pending issues, except 
the issue of al-'Aqabah Port? 
  [Al-Majali] The main topic on the agenda now is the entire 
Middle East file. Also, there are the issues related to 
Jordanian economy, support, and debts. 
  [Al-Jawhari] What is the size of the Jordanian debts to the 
United States? 
  [Al-Majali] Jordan's indebtedness to the United States is 
estimated at a large sum of money. I do not know the exact 
figure, but the debts are not less than 1,000 million dollars. 
  [Al-Jawhari] What about U.S. aid to Jordan? 
  [Al-Majali] We must review this issue as well as economic 
support for Jordan, particularly since we are passing through a 
delicate economic stage. There should be a remedy for this. 
  [Al-Jawhari] It was announced that his majesty the king 
discussed this issue during his previous visit to Washington? 
  [Al-Majali] Measures were taken at that time, however, we 
seek further measures to strengthen this cooperation. 
  [Al-Jawhari] Do you expect the recent agreements on the 
sub-agendas with Israel to improve the objective circumstances 
that would help the U.S. Administration make a decision to 
resume aid to Jordan? 
  [Al-Majali] Of course, we hope so. This is what should be 
done. As you know, America is a major sponsor of the peace 
process. Therefore, we must discuss all aspects of this issue. 
It is known that the circumstances that follow the peace 
process will be more serious and more delicate than the 
circumstances that follow wars because people seek a better 
life. How can we achieve a better life if we do not have a 
strong and progressive economy. 
  [Al-Jawhari] Will you present specific economic requests to 
the U.S. Administration? 
  [Al-Majali] The economic issue is as large as the sea. We 
will present all issues that could be discussed. We, of course, 
have giant projects that need to be tackled. We also have other 
issues related to security forces that need continuous U.S. 
support because protecting security is not less important than 
protecting the homeland. 
  [Al-Jawhari] The joint statement which was issued recently 
following the meeting between the Jordanian and Israeli 
delegations in Washington noted briefly the canal project 
linking the Red Sea to the Dead Sea. 
  [Al-Majali] It is still a dream. All these issues are part 
of the peace scene. However, a long time is needed to assess 
the feasibility and returns of such an accomplishment. 
  [Al-Jawhari] Are you Mr. Prime Minister optimistic that 
peace 
would achieve economic prosperity in Jordan? 
  [Al-Majali] All my life I have been optimistic. There can be 
no peace in a region where there is a big disparity in people's 
incomes. There can be no peace between a country where the 
average income of an individual is $15,000 a year, as the case 
is in Israel, and the Arab countries, which are interested in 
peace and where the income of an individual is $2,000 a year. 
  Peace cannot be achieve when there is this big difference in 
the individual's rate of income. There must be a change. 
  [Al-Jawhari] Is it correct that the U.S. Administration 
proposed to Jordan the convening of a public tripartite summit 
between his majesty the king, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin, and U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington, and that 
Jordan has rejected this at the present stage? 
  [Al-Majali] I have no information about such proposal. I 
have not heard of it. 
  [Al-Jawhari] There has been no Jordanian reaction to the 
Israeli reports that his majesty the king met secretly with 
Rabin in London? 
  [Al-Majali] We do not have to issue a denial each time 
Israel 
sends out a test balloon. 
  [Al-Jawhari] There are reports that his majesty the king 
telephoned Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad before he left for 
Washington. How true are these reports? 
  [Al-Majali] I do not have information on this, and his 
majesty did not inform me of such a contact, but it is known 
that his majesty is in continuous contact with His Excellency 
Hafiz al-Asad and their relations are very warm. Our strategy 
and theirs are in full accord. Our dream is that our relations 
will be strong, advanced, and continue to move forward. 
  [Al-Jawhari] Your Excellency, how do you view the 
possibility 
of containing the current situation between the two countries? 
  [Al-Majali] The current situation may be the result of 
influence of a third party, an individual or a state, that does 
not like Jordanian-Syrian relations to be so good, so it tries 
to make problems here and there. Sometimes there is inaccurate 
reading of a certain subject. For our part, I would like to 
emphasize that we believe in a comprehensive solution. We do 
not at all believe in separate actions. We believe in 
coordination, but we and all others admit that the pace of 
negotiations is different on different tracks because every 
track has its own problems. This is something that the four 
concerned parties, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, and the Palestinians 
admit. 
  [Al-Jawhari] Does the difference in positions between Jordan 
and the Gulf states on the Yemeni crisis obstruct the hoped-for 
Jordanian-Gulf meeting? 
  [Al-Majali] I hope this will not at all happen. Regarding 
Yemen, we believe in unity, we have full faith in any unity, and 
we fear secession and division, not only in Yemen but in every 
Arab country, and every Arab country could suffer what Yemen is 
currently suffering. We believe in unity and we support any 
unity. We are not with one party against another, and this is 
clear. As for our terms in the press about the constitutional 
legitimacy that should be respected, it is because elections 
were held freely and honestly. These elections led to a 
parliament which elected a Presidential Council and a chairman 
for this council. We cannot abandon unity, and we believe in 
unity, but at the same time we do not approve fighting 
regardless of its causes. 
  [Al-Jawhari] Is Jordan currently making any efforts to solve 
the Yemeni crisis? 
  [Al-Majali] We are always ready to make efforts to close 
Arab 
ranks. I spoke more than once about the need to admit that 
there are Arab differences, and I propose solving them in the 
same manner economic issues are solved. I propose scheduling 
resolvement of these differences within 10 years, and to suspend 
discussing them during the first three years, and then we open 
the files one after another. As for now, let's forget all 
differences for three years because we are passing through very 
delicate circumstances within the framework of the world order, 
regional order, and the proposed Middle East market. If we do 
not have a common position on these issues, we will all be 
destroyed by them. 
  [Al-Jawhari] Have you presented your idea about scheduling 
differences to the Arab countries? 
  [Al-Majali] I did not present it officially, but I am 
presenting it openly, and I thank the press for propagating it. 
I think the only possible solution is through admitting that 
there are problems between Arab countries, and then to decide to 
solve them within 10 years, with the first three years being a 
grace period in which we do not discuss these differences. 
  [Al-Jawhari] Is there any other way? 
  [Al-Majali] If we open the files of differences now we may 
clash. We should postpone discussing these differences, hoping 
to find points on which we agree and work on their basis, and 
leave the points of disagreement for discussion at the 
appropriate time.

<F P=106> [Report by Ahmad al-Yamani] </F>
  [Text] Al-'Aqabah -- While preparations were under way to 
celebrate the anniversary of the Great Arab Revolt, led by 
al-Sharif Husayn I of Mecca, a large number of U.S. rapid 
intervention forces of aggression were present in the port city 
of al-'Aqabah and the al-Jafr area for their usual annual 
exercises and training on fighting us in the desert, sea, and 
air. 
  These forces had earlier participated in the 30-state 
aggression against Iraq and attacked our trucks and oil tankers, 
burning them and killing their occupants--our sons--while 
driving along the road in Jordan. 
  Allowing the U.S. forces of aggression to pursue training on 
fighting us or resting and recreating in Jordan requires all the 
national forces and their representatives in the House of 
Representatives to firmly prevent this provocation and stop 
these exercises, which are due to last one month.

  [Text] Within a few days, the priorities of Jordan's 
policies have turned upside down. The Jordanian-Israeli track 
of the negotiations has moved quickly in both the political and 
economic directions and Dr. Fayiz al-Tarawinah, head of the 
Jordanian delegation, and Elyaqim Rubinstein, head of the 
Israeli delegation, have voiced their full satisfaction with 
achievements made during the first hours of the negotiations. 
Throughout last week, the Israeli and international media were 
preoccupied with disseminating reports that high-level 
Jordanian-Israeli meetings took place in London prior to the 
Washington negotiations and cleared the way for rapid progress 
and movement of the talks to al-'Aqabah and Elat. As a result, 
Jordanian-Syrian relations were strained after they were 
prepared only two weeks ago to reach a high level of 
coordination and after the Husayn-al-Asad summit decided in 
Damascus last month to revive the joint Syrian-Jordanian 
committee that was suspended for a long time due to the two 
countries' differences over the Gulf war. 
  For the first time in three years, the Jordanian and Syrian 
press exchanged polemics in public. The Syrian newspaper 
TISHRIN commented on an article published in the Jordanian 
newspaper AL-RA'Y calling for the revival of the 
Jordanian-Israeli track of negotiations without waiting for the 
other Arab parties. 
  The Syrian press also implicitly replied to statements that 
the London-based AL-HAYAT newspaper attributed to the Jordanian 
prime minister, who quickly denied these statements, which 
included Jordan's reservation on a Syrian proposal for unity 
between the two countries. 
  The major phenomenon of the deteriorating Jordanian-Syrian 
relations is Syria's decision to cancel the visit, which Syrian 
Prime Minister Mahmud al-Zu'bi was to pay to Amman at the head 
of a high-level political and economic delegation, including 
Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar'. 
  The Syrians explained that Jordan, which is currently 
holding 
economic negotiations with Israel and the United States within 
the framework of the tripartite development committee, may turn 
into a bridge for normalizing relations between Syria and Israel 
when it concludes economic agreements with Syria. Moreover, any 
dealing with Israel will prevent integration with Syria, 
especially since its negotiations with Israel have not yet 
resulted in peace. 
  Therefore, Jordan's relations, which are deteriorating with 
Saudi Arabia and most Gulf states, which are weakening with 
Iraq, and which are fluctuating with the PLO, have also 
deteriorated with Syria and Lebanon due to Jordan's openness 
toward Israel.

<F P=106> [Report by Salamah Ni'mat: "Jordan Considers Its Position </F>
`Identical' to the Syrian Position"] 
  [Text] Amman -- A reliable Jordanian source said yesterday 
that the forthcoming Jordanian-Israeli negotiations on Israeli 
withdrawal from the occupied Jordanian territory before entering 
into "normalization agreements" are identical with the Syrian 
position which calls on Israel "to withdraw fully in return for 
full peace." 
  The source told AL-HAYAH that Jordan's demands for the 
return 
of its occupied territory and for the definition and demarcation 
of its international borders are "equal to the Sryian call for 
Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Golan in return for peace 
with Israel." The source noted that Damascus "called for 
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan in return for peace, not 
withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories including the 
Jordanian, Palestinian, and Lebanese territories." He added 
that a definition and demarcation of the Jordanian borders 
"would help in the demarcation of the border of the future 
Palestinian state...east of the West Bank." 
  The informed source stressed that "when the question of the 
Palestinian Golan was mentioned, Jordan's aim in talking about 
it was to support the Syrian position that that territory is 
Syrian...certainly not Israeli." 
  Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali had said at a 
closed session of the House of Representatives last week that a 
dispute over the ownership of al-Himmah triangle known as the 
"Palestinian Golan" was one of the most important obstacles 
standing in the way of a draft agreement with Israel on the 
Syrian Golan Heights.

  [Text] Rabat, Jun. 11 (MAP) -- The identification of 
persons eligible to vote in the projected UN referendum in the 
Sahara is meant to make sure that the persons concerned actually 
meet one of the five criteria required for participation in the 
referendum. 
  This came in the interview assistant special representative 
of the UN secretary general for the Sahara and Chairman of the 
Identification Commission Eric Jensen had with Moroccan 
'L'OPINION' daily. 
  Jensen said some of the criteria are simple while others are 
not. The simplest one is that of the persons on the lists of the 
Spanish census of 1974. 
  The identification process is meant to check up if the 
persons are actually eligible to vote in the referendum, he 
said, adding that "there are difficult cases, because some times 
the documents produced are very old, so it was necessary to 
associate chioukhs who know the [word indistinct] in the 
identification operation." 
  To a question on the duration of the operation, Jensen said 
"it is too early to tell. We have nearly 56,000 registered 
persons, but we expect much more." 
  "For the time being, I do not see any political 
difficulties." The two sides "ensured me that they are ready to 
apply the Security Council resolutions." "This means that we 
will actually start the identification process," he said. 
  The five criteria required for participation in the 
referendum are that people's names be on the lists of the 
Spanish census of 1974, the people who were living in the 
territory as a member of a Sahrawi tribe at the moment of the 
census of 1974, but who could not be covered by the census, the 
relatives of these two first groups (the father, mother and 
children), the people born to a Saharawi father born in the 
territory, the people, member of Saharawi tribes belonging to 
the territory, who lived in the territory for six consecutive 
years or intermittently during a cumilative period of 12 years 
before December 1st, 1974.

  [Text] New developments have taken place in the Saharan 
voters' registration issue. After new information was given by 
the Saharan side with regard to the travel by thousands of 
Moroccan citizens to the Saharan territory, the UN mission in 
charge of organizing the referendum in Western Sahara denied 
this information. Over to you Abdelkader Cherti, 
  [Abdelkeder] In a statement delivered to APS yesterday, the 
Popular Front for the Liberation of Saquia El Hamra and Rio de 
Oro [Polisario] affirmed the arrival by bus in recent days of 
thousands of Moroccan citizens in Laayoune and Bojador to 
participate in the voter identification, which started in 
Western Sahara under UN supervision before the organization of 
the referendum on self-determination in Western Sahara. 
  The Polisario Front said that the operation is considered a 
blatant violation of the UN peace plan in Western Sahara and the 
aim behind it is to undermine the referendum and spoil the 
atmosphere in which the UN committee for voter identification 
works. 
  In view of these developments, the Polisario Front called on 
UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and the UN Security 
Council to take the necessary measures to guarantee the smooth 
operation of voter identification in an atmosphere of freedom 
and strictness. 
  In contrast with the contents of the Polisario Front's 
statement, the UN committee in charge of implementing the 
referendum in Western Sahara denied yesterday evening the 
information contained in the Saharan statement and stressed that 
they did not notice buses loaded with Moroccan citizens, and, 
according to their statement, they did not receive any 
information to this effect.

<F P=106> ["Part Two" in a series of unattributed articles: "Getting </F>
Control -- The Muslim Brotherhood's Plans to Seize Power"] 
  [Text] The document entitled "Getting Control" [al-tamkin] 
is probably one of the gravest Muslim Brotherhood [MB] documents 
seized in the "al-Salsabil" case. As its title points out, it 
deals with the MB's plans to seize power; the title means, as 
the document literally says, "to prepare for shouldering the 
duties of the future and acquiring the ability to manage state 
affairs, and this cannot be achieved without a comprehensive 
plan that takes into its calculations the need for the MB to 
penetrate the vital classes in society and its influential 
establishments while remaining committed to a specific strategy 
against the other forces of society and in dealing with the 
outside world's forces." 
  The document, which consists of 13 sheets of foolscap paper, 
makes the task of penetrating the student, worker, professional, 
and business sectors and the less capable popular groups the 
cornerstone of the plan to take control because, as the document 
says, the MB's spread in these sectors will make the confronting 
the MB more difficult, will impose on the state more complicated 
considerations, and will also increase the MB's opportunities 
and ability to alter the situation and work to "get control." 
  But the document refers very clearly to the importance of 
the 
MB's penetration of the influential establishments in society. 
Herein lies the danger, because in the MB's view, the 
influential establishments are not just the professional 
associations, the media and judiciary establishments, and the 
People's Assembly, but also "other establishments" which are 
influential, have the ability to bring about change, and which 
the state might use in confronting and curtailing the MB. 
  The "Getting Control" document does not openly name the 
other 
establishments, and this is intentional. But the description 
very clearly refers to the army and police. Those who know the 
history of the MB are not surprised by this because the MB is 
the only political movement whose first option for reaching 
power always included penetration of the army and the police 
with the aim of seizing power. This was exactly what happened 
in Sudan recently. 
  The document also expounds a complete concept of how to deal 
with the unions, the pressure groups in society, and the 
political parties through a long-term policy, starting with 
"coordination," moving to "neutralization," then "containment," 
and then to taking the situation in hand and seizing control 
through controlling the decision-making centers. It also 
expounds on how to deal with Egypt's Copts, advocating a 
two-pronged policy: first, neutralize them by letting them feel 
that the MB does not pose a danger to them, and then second, 
limit the effectiveness of the Copts' role in public life and 
reduce their economic power in society. 
  Yet the most dangerous point in the document is the MB's 
concept of dealing with the outside world, especially the West 
and the United States. This reveals the MB's real face, because 
the document asserts the importance of making the West, 
especially the United States, feel that the MB does not pose a 
danger to their interests and that it is in the West's interest 
to deal with the MB after they succeed in "getting control" 
because the MB represents stability and discipline. 
  This is the content of the document, which we now publish in 
full together with an example of its application to all the 
governorates. We have not changed anything. As we said in the 
first part, these are the MB's own documents and papers, 
testifying to their plots to overthrow the regime and seize 
power. 
  It is composed of thirteen large foolscap pages with the 
title "Getting Control," written in the form of a report that 
stresses that the new stage in the MB's existence requires 
confrontation and will not tolerate the generality of the former 
objectives of penetration and spreading. The document warns 
against making conflicting decisions on the situations facing 
the MB, the foreign challenges and threats, and the overt 
confrontation between the existing regimes and the political 
Islam movements operating in the political arena. 
  The document begins with two questions that constitute the 
core of the plan for "getting control." The first question: 
What do they seek to achieve? And second: What should be the 
short-term situation in regard to the accomplishment of the 
mission, continuity, preparedness for future tasks, and 
promoting competence? 
  The mission as the MB understands it and according to the 
text of the document is aimed at preparing its members to 
shoulder the tasks of the future and be capable of running the 
state, and at preparing the internal structure for the tasks of 
the stage of "competence." By competence, the document means 
drawing up a policy to confront external dangers, namely 
attempts to frustrate the MB's schemes to take power and 
penetrate the society through: 

  -  spreading to the vital class of society and knowing how to 
incite them. 
  -  spreading to the effective establishments, namely the army 
and 
police. 
  -  dealing with other forces and; lastly 
  -  making use of the external dimension. 


    The document underlines that spreading throughout the vital 
classes of the people and having the ability to incite them 
would yield several benefits for the Muslim Brotherhood. Most 
importantly, this permeation would lessen threats and make 
confrontation with the MB more difficult. The ability to incite 
these classes would enhance the opportunities for effecting a 
change and enhance the chances of achieving the mission, that 
is, the ability to run state affairs and take power. 
  According to the text of the document, the sectors of the 
people marked for penetration and permeation in order to control 
them were chosen on the following bases: 

  -  ease of penetration 
  -  ability to influence and incite them 
  -  the ease with which they could be manipulated 
  -  continuity of influence over them. 


    According to these four conditions, the MB chose students, 
workers, artisans, businessmen, and popular classes as the 
segments to accomplish the two parts of the plan for getting 
power. 
  Regarding the students, it is easy for the MB to penetrate 
them, spread among them, incite them, and continue to influence 
them. 
  Regarding the workers, it is easy to spread among them and 
incite them. As for the artisans, it is easy to penetrate and 
influence them and somewhat easy to incite them. The 
businessmen are an easy sector to influence and to sustain the 
influence. The popular classes are easy to penetrate and incite. 
<H5>  The Army And The Police </H5>
  Perhaps the most dangerous aspect of this document is the 
part dealing with implementing the plan for "getting control" in 
vital establishments. The document describes these 
establishments as those representing: 
  1. A tool to undermine and confront the Islamic movement. 
  2. A real addition to the movement's power and 
effectiveness in making changes. 
  Although these two conditions fit only the army and the 
police, as we pointed out in the preamble, the document's 
description of these establishments confirms our theory that 
they do mean the army and the police. The document says that 
choosing the vital establishments depends on the following 
criteria: 
  1. Their effectiveness in confronting and undermining the 
Islamic movement. 
  2. Their ability to make changes. 
  3. The comprehensiveness and broadness of their influence. 
  4. Long-term confrontation. 
  The document indicates the army and the police are two of 
its 
most important targets, along with the influential 
establishments, foremost among which is the media establishment. 
The latter, according to the document, has comprehensive, 
wide-ranging, and long-term influence, has the ability to make 
changes, and can prove effective in the confrontation. 
  Regarding the religious establishment, al-Azhar, the 
document 
says that it has the same characteristics as the media 
establishment, but in its own way. 
  As for the judiciary, the document notes that it is known 
for 
its effectiveness in causing change, particularly in the 
legislature-- that is, the People's Assembly. 
<H5>  Dealing With Others </H5>
  The document discusses in detail what is known as dealing 
carefully with others as part of the plan for "getting control" 
and the "know your enemy" method. It says: We are not 
operating alone, for there are other forces in the arena that 
negatively or positively affect our ability to perform our 
mission. Therefore, the continuity of the efforts for "getting 
control" requires careful action with a view to containing the 
others, coexisting, neutralizing, and minimizing the 
effectiveness of the opposing quarters, while coordinating with 
neutral quarters that have not defined their positions or that 
support our mission--the brothers in full or in part. The 
document adds: We have to take into consideration that we must 
be able to deal with different types of cases simultaneously. 
  There are options before the MB with regard to the 
authorities: 
  1. Containment by exploiting the authorities' establishments 
to fulfill the MB's mission through the decision-making process 
or by changing their systems. 
  2. Coexistence--in other words, working to create a form of 
coexistence with the regime by influencing situations and thus 
making the regime eager to keep our effective presence. 
  3. Neutralization by letting them -- that is the authorities 
-- feel that we do not pose a danger to them. 
  4. Reducing the authorities' effectiveness in the 
confrontation so as to continue the efforts to get control. 
  On the issue of dealing with the Copts, the document says: 
One of three ways of dealing with the Coptic community must be 
chosen: 
  1. Coexistence by convincing them that they have an interest 
in realizing Islamic rule and the justice it brings, which the 
present regime cannot provide. 
  2. Neutralization by making the Copts feel that we -- the MB 
-- are not hostile to them and do not pose any danger to them. 
The document calls this "securing" [al-ta'min], that is, 
winning over the Copts. 
  3. Reducing the scope of their threat and their economic 
influence and material force. The document defines this as 
"fragmentation"--that is, fragmenting the Coptic ranks facing 
the MB. 
  The document does not fail to define the stand vis-a-vis the 
Jews; it is limited to one line, namely: "The effectiveness of 
their threat in all fields must be minimized." 
<H5>  And the Groups </H5>
  For the MB, the other groups include the pressure groups and 
the parties in addition to the authority, Copts, and Jews. It 
is not strange for the document to add the clubs, the suspicious 
societies "according to the document," the Islamic groups, and 
Islamist thinkers to the above groups. 
  Regarding the clubs and suspicious societies, the document 
says -- without naming these clubs or their types -- that their 
danger lies in their influence on the decision-making centers 
through executive figures and in their influence on public 
opinion through the leaders in the media and the arts. This 
leads to the adoption of decisions and laws that serve their 
interests to a great degree. Penetrating them is difficult due 
to the information that they receive from certain levels. The 
inability to prove their dangerousness in a practical way is 
clearly a weak point and we -- the MB -- must realize this in 
order to rectify it. We must cope with this sector by 
minimizing the effectiveness of their threat. 
  In the section dealing with parties and pressure groups, 
the document says: This section includes professional 
associations, family and tribal groupings, international "human 
rights" organizations, economic forums like "the businessmen's 
society..." [ellipsis as published], and the existing parties. 
The document explains that dealings will take place at several 
levels: 
  1. Steering. Joining and controlling the decision-making 
centers so that we have a majority. 
  2. Coordination. If we do not have a majority, we must 
coordinate with them in areas where we have common grounds and 
even find joint interests with them. 
  3. At this level, the document combines the methods of 
containment, neutralization, and minimizing of the effectiveness 
of others should the steering or the coordination efforts fail. 
The document notes that dealing with parties and associations 
may take various forms because of their nature and the 
divergence of their views. 
  The gravest part of this document is the one dealing with 
the 
Islamic groups and Islamic thinkers. In this section, the MB 
openly reveals its position regarding these groups for the first 
time. According to the text of the document, this section 
includes: 

  -  Independent Islamic groups and thinkers who are in 
agreement with us, even partly, regarding the mission but who 
differ over the details. This requires coordination, 
cooperation, integration, and alliances. If the alliance and 
coordination efforts fail, containment, neutralization, and 
coexistence tactics should be pursued. 
  -  Nonindependent Islamic groups and thinkers affiliated with 
specific quarters that are used to strike at and obstruct our 
efforts at "getting control." Attempts should be made to steer, 
contain, or neutralize them so as to minimize their 
effectiveness. 


<H5>    America and the West </H5>
  In another paragraph headed "Hostile External 
Forces--America 
and the West," the document says verbatim that dealing with them 
begins with the stage of coexistence. This can be achieved by 
persuading them that it is in their interest to deal with the 
existing forces in the region, and that as a force the MB is 
characterized by stability and discipline. However, dealing 
with the West will pass through a stage of neutralization. This 
can be done by letting the West feel that it is in its interest 
not to harm us, because we pose no threat to them so long as 
they do not obstruct the efforts for "getting control." In the 
meantime, we, the MB, could affect their interests should they 
stand against these efforts. 
  The last stage of dealing with the West and the United 
States 
is the one of minimizing their effectiveness, which can be 
achieved by means of minimizing their threat. This can be done 
by directly affecting their interests and weakening the ability 
of their institutions to influence the decision-making process 
for their interests. Whenever possible, however, we must 
benefit from the external domain. 
<H5>  Managing the State </H5>
  The most dangerous point in this document is probably the 
plan for the coup that the MB is preparing in order to seize 
power and reach the stage of managing the state's affairs or 
what is termed in this document as the preparation for future 
tasks. 
  The document says: Creating a social situation that would 
allow us to "get control" requires that we be able to manage the 
state's affairs and that we realize it is possible that we might 
be compelled to manage the state's affairs by ourselves. At the 
same time, "getting control" will lead to the rallying of 
hostile foreign forces. Hence, preparations must be made to 
confront the internal and external challenges; this means that 
we -- the MB -- must have a plan for confronting these 
challenges by getting the necessary resources to do so and the 
ability to use them. This requires the preparation of the 
internal structure in line with the changing requirements and 
making the optimum use of the resources, which the document 
labels "competence" [al-kafa'ah]. The document adds that this 
is the practical challenge in achieving the various objectives 
of the plan. This requires the development of the particulars 
of the internal structure so as to be in line with the nature of 
the coming stage -- both from the conceptual angle and the 
preparation of individuals and the internal structure -- in the 
following way: 
  Regarding the concept--which is one of the most important 
sides in the triangle of competence--this requires the 
concentration of the membership's efforts on construction and 
change. Therefore it is important for the ranks, "the MB 
elements," to understand fully the issue of change and to have a 
very clear idea of its directions so that the plan will not meet 
with passive resistance from within. It is necessary to start 
submitting the issue of change to dialogues at all levels in 
order to let everyone interact and participate, thus initiating 
ideas and initiatives and giving substance to the issue. 
  Regarding indoctrinating individuals, the document says that 
the existing indoctrination program should include the effects 
of the plan on various particulars. 
  Permeating the classes of society, which is the core of the 
"getting control" plan, requires raising the individuals' 
ability to influence a large sector of society and thus improve 
the level of dialogue, the ability to convince and train through 
the following: 

  -  Creating a balance between the propagation carried out by 
individuals so as to unite the ranks and make the propagation 
widespread. 
  -  Developing the leadership circles and the ability to activate 
the groups. 


    As for permeating influential establishments, this requires 
the following: 

  -  Raising the individuals' ability to penetrate the 
establishments without losing their identities. 
  -  Raising the individuals' ability to handle information. 

  As for dealings with the other forces, individuals must be 
groomed to establish intellectual or practical bridges with 
them. As for the mission of running the state and future 
missions, this requires the following: 
  1. Attention must be given to a select group, which will 
develop the ability to run public establishments. 
  2. The ability to absorb and benefit from distinguished 
figures in various sectors. 
  Regarding structural building, the practical method of 
management requires: 

  -  The availability of the necessary information to perform 
various missions. 
  -  The establishment of the principle of authorization and 
decentralization in action whenever possible. 
  -  The establishment of the principle of nonengagement of 
individuals, so they will be free to occupy important positions. 
  -  The flexibility of the structure to allow for adding new 
entities in accordance with the plan "information apparatus- 
political relations." 
  -  Completing the structure on the basis of the importance and 
priority of the action in the plan. 

<H5>  The Importance </H5>
  After finishing with indoctrination and the structural 
formation of individuals and the structures of groups, the 
document moves to the most dangerous part. It outlines the 
priorities of actions in all sectors and the relative importance 
of each sector, and defines the degree of penetration achieved 
and those who will be targeted, using figures and 
percentages--which proves the scientific and methodological 
nature of the plan. 
  In this regard, the document says: 
  1. As far as ensuring the success of the efforts for 
"getting 
control," the social classes that must be penetrated are: 
Students, laborers, professionals, businessmen, and low-income 
people, in that order. 
  As far as the vital establishments are concerned, the 
following influential establishments could be named: The media, 
the religious establishment, the judiciary, the parliament. The 
document adds that the goal of dealing with others concerns the 
need to deal with the authorities first, then with the Copts, 
the Jews, the West, the suspicious clubs, pressure groups, 
parties, and Islamic groups. 
  2. Preparedness for future missions in "running of the 
state." The document names first the universities, 
professionals, public institutions, institutions that have a 
specific mission, and finally the economic institutions for 
"financing." 
  3. Betterment of society. The document here selects for 
penetration and infiltration the educational institutions, the 
media, the religious and cultural establishment, economic 
institutions, and technological institutions. 
  4. As far as internal preparations are concerned, the goal 
is 
to deepen the vision and complete the structural formation and 
reforms. 
  As far as the four goals are concerned, the document 
allocates 40 percent of efforts to continuing the "getting 
control" plan, 30 percent to internal structuring, 20 percent to 
the betterment of society, and the remaining 10 percent to 
preparations for the future missions when "running the state." 
  Having precisely determined the importance of each of the 
four objectives of the plan, the document assigns weight to 
every track of action according to its importance and its 
contribution to the achievement of the set objective. 
  To the tracks within the first objective--"getting 
control"--the following weights are given: 50 percent to the 
penetration of society's vital sectors, 40 percent to the 
penetration of influential institutions, and 10 percent to 
dealings with others. Within these, there are subtracks, and 
each has its weight: In the penetration of the vital sectors, 
students are given 30 percent, workers 30 percent, professionals 
and businessmen 10 percent, and low-class people 20 percent. 
  In the track of influential institutions, the plan gives 
powerful establishments, "the Army and the police," 40 percent, 
and this goes up to 50 percent for the judiciary, 50 percent for 
the parliament, 30 percent for media, and 20 percent as a 
comparative weight for the religious establishment [figures as 
published]. In accordance with these weights, the plan sets the 
priorities of action in 1994 and determines rates to be achieved 
during the remaining seven months of this year. 
  Although the investigations have not yet determined the 
significance of these rates and standards, the MB says in this 
serious document that it made good progress in the stage of 
formation (2,100 points) compared to 1,425 points in the field 
of education, 900 points in economics, 780 points in the media, 
only 120 points in the area of parties and pressure groups, and 
400 points in the shantytowns. This shows that the internal 
organization made fine strides and that there were various 
degrees and stages of penetration of society, as the document 
shows on its last page. 
<H5>  The Plan's Guide </H5>
  In its final shape, the plan in itself constitutes the MB's 
manifesto of its future attempt to take over power and stage an 
internal coup against the existing regime. 
  The plan contains a guide specifying in detail and in 
accordance with a fixed and precise timetable the steps for 
staging the coup. The guide consists of five foolscap pages and 
six annexes, each representing a questionnaire for studying the 
real situation in every governorate, from the street committees, 
to families, to the guidance offices in the governorates. 
  According to the document, the following steps must be 
implemented in chronological order. 
  The first step: 
  The Administrative Bureau would choose a three-member 
committee called "the committee of planning and follow-up" or 
some such name expressing this type of function. One of its 
members, the moderator at least, would be a member of the 
Administrative Bureau. The bureau would choose at least one 
person to act as planning and follow-up delegate in the 
governorate. 
  The committee's primary function would be to direct and 
follow up planning operations, including proper implementation 
of any future steps, examining the performance of all involved 
functionaries, and developing plans and major ideas prior to 
submitting them to the Administrative Bureau. 
  According to the document, it is advisable for the above 
committee to include a representative of the chief 
administrative or geographical division--that is, the main town 
or district center-- and a representative for the various 
specialized divisions of the groups in the area. 
  The committee would meet and draw up a plan and a timetable 
to implement further steps. 
  The second step: 
  This consists of examining the Brotherhood's policies and 
deciding which policies must be maintained. 
  The Administrative Bureau in each governorate would carry 
out 
a detailed discussion of the Brotherhood's policies and arrive 
at two results. First, the policies would be translated into 
major guidelines governing the Brotherhood's activities in the 
governorate for the duration of the plan. 
  Secondly, members' comments and suggestions that the Bureau 
sees fit to submit to senior administrators and to the central 
planning unit would be recorded. These comments and suggestions 
are designed to improve policies and close any existing gaps. 
  The third step: 
  The local bureau in the governorate would examine the 
Brotherhood's course of action in the governorate during the 
previous plan. It would assess the following: 
  1. The details, clarity, and comprehensibility of the 
working 
plans. 
  2. The extent to which the objectives have been attained. 
  3. The lessons to be drawn from previous activities 
regarding the quality of planning and the competence of the 
planners, the practicality of the previous plan, and the 
problems that surfaced during the implementation of the plan. 
  The fourth step: 
  Gathering information on internal and external conditions. 
This was perhaps the most dangerous step of the "Salsabil" 
office's tasks. The office's activities were confined to 
gathering, classifying, and analyzing the information on the 
internal and external conditions as follows: 
  1. The information on internal conditions will also include 
details about the Brotherhood's members. The field leader will 
ask every member to fill out an information paper about himself. 
  The information on internal conditions also includes details 
about the organizational and administrative status in the 
governorate. These details will be collected by the field 
leader and will be finally reviewed and classified by the 
governorate's planning and follow-up committee. 
  2. The information on external conditions will also include: 
  A. Details about the status of the state and society in 
general. The central planning unit will supply this information. 
  B. Details about the governorate's society and 
departments. The representative of the planning and follow-up 
committee in the governorate will provide this information. 
  C. Details about the institutions, companies, and 
departments with which our personnel have a connection. The 
field official or the officials in charge of branches and 
divisions will gather such details. 
  D. Details about the most influential figures in the 
governorate with whom we cooperate and who have direct influence 
on us. 
  The fifth step: 
  After gathering the information, the representative of the 
planning and follow-up committee will prepare a three-part 
report as follows: 
  First part: It contains a list showing the points of 
internal weakness and strength. This list is prepared from the 
information gathered by the internal unit. The representative 
is anxious to classify these points according to their 
importance and effect. 
  Second part: It contains a list detailing the job 
opportunities on the one hand and the challenges and problems 
facing our members on the other. The representative will 
classify this information and its effects on our activities and 
the dangers and threats this information represents in the 
future. 
  Third part: The representative will compare the 
opportunities and challenges with the points of weakness and 
strength. He will define the opportunities which include points 
of strength that will enable us to exploit them. The 
representative will also define the points that we could not 
exploit easily due to the presence of specific weak points. He 
will define the threats that could increase due to the presence 
of weak points and that could be confronted by points of 
strength. 
  The sixth step: 
  Analyzing the previous objectives so that they can be used 
in 
the next stage. Also, assessing the success in implementing the 
objectives and comparing this with previous successes as 
mentioned in the first document. 
  The seventh step: 
  Here, methods of implementation are selected. The planning 
and follow-up committee would choose a set of appropriate 
methods to realize every objective. The committee would hold 
intensive consultations with the main formations in the 
governorates (geographical and technical). 
  The eighth step: 
  Drafting programs to put those methods chronologically, 
financially, and organizationally into practice. The planning 
and follow-up committee would translate the methods into plans 
of action with specified timetables. It would also specify 
approximate budgets for those methods and determine the 
organizational responsibilities for implementing every major 
activity. 
  The ninth step: 
  Sending the proposed plan to the formations in the 
governorates for evaluation and presentation to the base. The 
Administrative Bureau would supervise the forwarding of the 
proposed plan to the geographic formations and the technical 
divisions and its presentation to the executive bases in the 
governorates. 
  The various units would present their proposals to develop 
the plan to the Administrative Bureau. The bureau would refer 
them to the planning and follow-up committee, which, in turn, 
would examine them and try to use them to modify the proposed 
plan and send it back to the Administrative Bureau. 
  In this last stage, the Administrative Bureau would discuss 
the plan, decide on its final shape, adopt it as a basis for 
action, and send it to all formations so that they will be 
committed to it. The bureau would watch the progress of its 
various units in achieving the tasks assigned to them by the 
plan. 
  Here, the document known as the guide to the plan ends. It 
is the first practical model for implementing the "getting 
control" plan at the level of the governorate, beginning with 
the street committee and ending with the governorate's shura 
[consultative] council. The seriousness of the document lies in 
the fact that it uses scientific and technological methods in 
gathering information and data from the field or the locality, 
and this is one of the known security methods. The information 
and the date are then analyzed to determine the points of 
strength and weakness to help implement the "getting control" 
plan--seizing power and staging a well-devised coup program 
which the Brotherhood adopts in its secret organization. 
  Again, these are their own papers and documents, signed by 
their leaders. There is no way to deny that the Brotherhood is 
a coupist organization that believes only in secret activity, no 
matter what public facade it uses.
