  [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. The 
Majles met in open session yesterday chaired by Mr. 'Ali Akbar 
Nateq-Nuri, and the deputies from Mashhad, Khorramabad, 
Khodabandeh, and Ahar and Haris gave preagenda speeches. Then 
the Majles took up its agenda, and we direct the attention of 
our esteemed readers to the detailed proceedings. 
<H5>  Mohammad Hadi-'Abdkhoda'i, Deputy From Mashhad </H5>
  It is the skilled academic work force that is bringing the 
nation to a peak of cultural, political and economic authority. 
  The first preagenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles 
session was 'Abdkhoda'i, deputy from Mashhad. He offered 
condolences on the martyrdom of Imam Javad (peace be upon him). 
He said: The Majles is at the end of the First Five-Year Plan 
and the beginning of the Second Five-Year Plan. There is much to 
say about the splendidness of the Islamic revolution and its 
power to endure, about the crimes of world imperialism and its 
practices, about the cultural invasion and ostentation, about 
the economic programs and the mistakes of some of their 
planners, about high prices, inflation and ways to keep them 
down, about balance between the private and government sectors 
and avoiding one-dimensional activity, about controlling prices, 
about excessive purchases of goods, about borrowing and its 
consequences, and about the need for subsidies to support the 
deprived. 
  He continued: The Second Five-Year Plan must bring the 
country as close as possible to independence and nondependence. 
It must rely on high production, less consumption, more exports 
and fewer imports, and it must anticipate consequences and 
problems. 
  The speaker also discussed higher education programs. He 
said: The experts are presenting factors that will help a 
country grow and develop such as natural resources, manpower and 
proper management, but above all these things one can consider 
skilled academic manpower. Even capable management and useful 
manpower arise from their ranks. 
  Continuing, 'Abdkhoda'i said: It is the skilled academic 
work 
force that is bringing the nation to a peak of cultural, 
political and economic authority and makes the best use of 
natural resources. 
  The deputy from Mashhad said that to the extent it is able 
the government must invest in manpower training in the Second 
Five-Year Plan. He said: In this regard there is need for 
several reminders: 
  1. Manpower training must be done with proper planning based 
on needs. 
  2. The educational centers must definitely place great 
emphasis on the quality of education. Today we have little 
skilled manpower at the research and doctoral levels compared to 
our needs, and in this regard the doctoral programs must be 
reinforced both in quality and quantity. 
  3. The universities must give importance to applied 
knowledge 
and make knowledge work with ability. Some of our professors are 
even more advanced than the foreign professors academically, but 
unfortunately there are two shortages. One is that although they 
are strong in theory, in the area of practice they are not as 
strong, and they also lack the tools for work. 
  'Abdkhoda'i then said: A short experiment in the year 1372 
[21 March 1993-20 March 1994] was hopeful. As the result of 
cooperation between the academic institutions and the executive 
universities, by the end of the month of Azar [30 December], 453 
projects were carried out or were under way. A total of 19.8 
billion rials was spent and there was a good return. 
  The speaker discussed education at the doctoral level. He 
said: It was a disaster at our universities that last year in 
the nonmedical fields we had only about 1,200 doctoral students 
inside the country. In the same regard I must say that one of 
the benefits of forming the Ministry of Health was the admission 
of more students. In the year 1356 [21 March 1977-20 March 1978] 
844 students were admitted, but in the year 1365 [21 March 
1986-20 March 1987] the number reached 6,480, almost eight times 
as many, and this is considered a source of pride for the 
Islamic Republic of Iran. Unfortunately, however, after that the 
figures declined, so that in the year 1372 medical student 
admissions throughout the country was 3,656, and this figure is 
fully evocative. 
  The deputy from Mashhad discussed the shortage of physicians 
in the country and the fact that the number of our physicians is 
about one-fifth the number of physicians in some industrial 
nations. He said: Why are our professors unable to accept more 
students? 
  At the end of his speech, the deputy from Mashhad discussed 
the deprived areas in the Second Five-Year Plan. He said: On the 
fringes of the major cities and also in their rural areas we 
have places that are living in deprivation, but because they are 
close to prosperous areas, they do not receive the benefits of 
deprived areas, and their needs must definitely be addressed. 
Today one of the important sources of foreign exchange is 
tourism, and Mashhad can be the best base for attracting 
visitors from all the Islamic nations. However, the government 
must invest, and it must see Mashhad as a national city in 
relation to all of Iran and an international city in the world 
of Islam. 
<H5>  Mohammad Saleh-Taheri, Deputy From Khorramabad </H5>
  In the last 15 years we have not had a firm and 
comprehensive 
policy on economic matters. 
  The next speaker was Taheri, deputy from Khorramabad. In his 
speech he said: In the last year we have not had a firm and 
comprehensive policy on economic matters. Although the president 
of the republic, as the most concerned executive official, has 
always worked unceasingly and has not been out of range or 
immune to damage from domestic and foreign enemies, God has 
always been generous with his boundless help at sensitive times. 
  He added: The chaotic foreign exchange market; the 7-tuman 
competitive rate and the 80-tuman rate for foreign exchange; the 
failure to anchor the inflationary rate for the dollar; the 
release of contradictory guidelines by the banks themselves; 
insubstantial and increasing taxes, which in my view erode the 
principle of investment; increases in the rate on bank deposits 
to 18.5 percent by the Money and Credit Council, which is very 
strongly rumored; the increase in the rate on foreign exchange 
for investment in projects without setting priorities; and the 
failure to control either the unregulated or the government 
prices. [sentence as published] 
  The deputy from Khorramabad noted: For example, the price of 
a kilogram of cucumbers increases from 15 to 150 tumans between 
the time it leaves the hands of the producer until it reaches 
the consumer of Africa Street. The oil price crisis and the 
playing with OPEC that is being done by foreigners and economic 
speculators, low prices whenever production is high, low 
production whenever prices are high and thousands of other 
problems have given our country an ailing economy. 
  Our people know well that everyone was mobilized during the 
war and they were never psychologically shocked in victory or in 
defeat under the leadership of the late leader of the 
revolution, the fifth anniversary of whose death is approaching, 
because the participation of the people and the close 
relationship between the leader and the people prevailed over 
the problem of the war. Unfortunately, that formula is not 
working in the economic situation. 
  He explained that in his view the people are innocent. He 
said: The people do not doubt the sincerity of the officials. 
Today economic planning requires a lot of manpower. A handful of 
experts, no matter how good, will not solve the problem. Mr. 
Hashemi is the guardian of policy, culture, society, and 
religion. Economics is another matter. 
  In my view we need to reconsider the situation. I myself 
have 
been among the gentlemen for 30 years, with the revolutionaries 
both before and after the opening of Mecca. We ourselves still 
have not been unable to understand, much less our other people. 
Deputies, there is still time, but tomorrow will be too late. 
While we still have these honest companions of the Imam, while 
we are still under the shadow of the leader and the vice regency 
of the chief jurisconsult, who always has the last word, you 
must clarify the nation's economic situation. This problem must 
be solved. 
  Taheri discussed the fact that we do not reject work and 
service in the country. He said: Work has been done in all the 
ministries. These communications and their extensive reach, 
fiber optics and copper cable in Yazd, petrochemicals in 
Bandar-Emam and thousands of other phenomena are undeniable. 
These phenomena should stimulate questions and conversation, 
instead of us having interpellation and bringing the country to 
a standstill, although interpellation is the clear right of the 
deputies and in some cases is a necessary and unavoidable 
procedure. 
  The blessed trip by the president of the republic to the 
province of Lorestan, the new political coordination in the 
province thanks to his visit, and the documented report from the 
province's political official made at the Administrative Council 
in the presence of the president of the republic were and are 
desired by all the general managers, Friday imams and the 
province's contingent of deputies, and the report must be 
published in the province. 
  He added: Among this trip's many blessings was the lighting 
of the gas flame at Borujerd and Aligudarz and the ground 
breaking for the gas facilities at Khorramabad by the minister 
of petroleum. For this purpose 2 billion tumans has been set 
aside and allocated. The rightful promise of the petrochemical 
units in the province are compensation for the losses to 
Lorestan caused by the oppressive construction of the 
petrochemical complex in Arak. Continuing, Taheri issued a memo 
to the minister of the interior about creating governorates in 
Azna, Alshotor, and Poldokhtar. He noted: The main problem in 
the country is clarification of the economic situation and its 
disrupted state in all its dimensions. The main problem in the 
province of Lorestan is unemployment, unemployment and 
unemployment. 
<H5>  Seyyed Mohammad 'Ali Musavi, Deputy From Khodabandeh </H5>
  The Second Five-Year Plan must be designed in such a way 
that 
the people will be optimistic about the nation's future. 
  The next speaker was Musavi, deputy from Khodabandeh. During 
his speech he offered condolences on the occasion of the 
martyrdom of Imam Mohammad Taqi (peace be upon him). He 
discussed the exalted leader's New Year's message with regard to 
the work ethic, social order, and designing the Second Five-Year 
Plan. He expressed the hope that the plan will be designed in 
such a way that the people will be more optimistic than before 
about the nation's future. 
  The speaker then discussed the report on activities carried 
out by the president of the republic with regard to the First 
Five-Year Plan. He said: It is hoped that the Majles and the 
toiling government will take hopeful steps to stop the bad 
effects of inflation and high prices and to reform the nation's 
administrative structure, which is already under discussion. 
  The deputy from Khodabandeh then discussed the various 
advances that have been made in the country. He said: In the 
year 1357 [21 March 1978-20 March 1979] 3.79 million tons of 
wheat was produced, while 10.8 million tons was produced in the 
year 1372. With regard to communications, the results of one 
year of activity in communications were equal to 20 years of 
communications activity before the revolution. 
  In conclusion, he said: 
  1. The minister of petroleum is asked to take note of the 
cold climate in the Khodabandeh region and its short season for 
laying gas pipes, and he is asked to give attention to the 
matter of supplying gas service to this municipality. 
  2. I ask the minister of roads and transportation to deal 
expeditiously with the first section of the road from Qidar to 
Bijar, which was abandoned incomplete, while its second section 
from Bijar to the east was completed, and also to attend to the 
road from Qidar to Kabudarahang, on which work is proceeding 
slowly. 
  3. I asked the minister of agriculture to help his 
representative more than before with the procurement of 
agricultural implements. 
<H5>  Valiollah Ahmadi-Zadsaray, Deputy From Ahar and Haris </H5>
  To solve the problems of the people, some thinking must be 
done so that they will no longer be subjected to the pressures 
of inflation and high prices. 
  Ahmadi-Zadsaray, deputy from Ahar and Haris, was the final 
preagenda speaker. During his speech he offered condolences on 
the martyrdom of Imam Mohammad Taqi (peace be upon him) and he 
commemorated Teacher Week. He said: Now, as the task of studying 
the government's Second Five-Year Plan is on the agendas of the 
Majles commissions, I ask my respected colleagues to give 
attention to the following as they study the plan: In view of 
the situation that has developed and is developing in the world 
with regard to oil prices, destroying the justification for the 
prices, in designing the Second Five-Year Plan measures must be 
adopted to deliver the nation from dependence on oil, and the 
planners must give great importance to agricultural and 
livestock products and their export. 
  He added: Many studies must be done concerning the creation 
of conversion industries and agriculture and animal husbandry, 
and we must give priority to the creation of such industries. 
The importation of nonessential and decorative goods must be 
avoided. 
  Consideration must be given to the problem of youth 
unemployment, especially those who have sacrificed, combatants 
and injured war veterans, and more attention must be given to 
the creation of employment-creating projects. To solve the 
problems of the people, especially the deprived and oppressed 
classes of society and the government staff workers, they must 
do some thinking and planning so they will no longer be 
subjected to the pressures of inflation and high prices. 
  He expressed thanks for the trip by the minister of energy 
and his entourage to the area. He said: During Teacher Week Ahar 
witnessed the minister of education and training going among the 
people and the teachers. On the auspicious occasion of this 
esteemed week, the teacher training building was opened, and I 
thank him for that. 
  I ask the government to allocate industrial and 
employment-creating projects in view of the fact that the 
necessary potential exists in the municipalities of Ahar and 
Haris, and to take effective steps to create employment for the 
region's unemployed to bring about economic growth in the region. 
  I ask the minister of education and training and the 
minister 
of higher education to start the agricultural college that was 
approved years ago, and to construct a building on the donated 
land. He also mentioned the shortage of athletic facilities in 
his electoral district. 
<H5>  Legislation </H5>
<H5>  Motion on Procedures for Rendering Obligatory Service for </H5>
Graduates in the Judicial Sciences 
  The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles 
session was continued consideration of the report from the first 
consultation of the Councils and Domestic Affairs Commission 
concerning the Motion To Spend the Period of Obligatory Service 
for Graduates From the Judicial Affairs Colleges in the Nation's 
Public Prosecutor's Offices and Judicial Courts, the general 
form of which was approved. 
  It is worth mentioning that the aforementioned motion 
states: 
"Graduates from the judicial affairs colleges affiliated with 
the Ministry of Justice of the Islamic Republic of Iran who have 
not performed their service as soldiers, provided they commit to 
at least five years of service in the judicial power, are exempt 
from service under the flag in peacetime." 
<H5>  Reasoning of Opponents and Supporters </H5>
  To summarize the remarks of the motion's opponents, this 
action is discriminatory and is not a good innovation. What is 
the difference between law colleges and other universities and 
the Ministry of Justice Judicial Sciences College, that the 
students in the judicial sciences should be exempt, but not 
students from the other colleges? The other government 
universities are going to learn that they must say that their 
graduates should be exempt from service as soldiers. 
  Supporters of the motion claim that this action is not 
discriminatory, but it is a solution to the nation's judicial 
problems. They say if it were discriminatory, we would not 
permit students in teacher training colleges to spend their 
obligatory military service time as teachers in various regions. 
  Likewise, with regard to this motion, Dr. Shahrzad, deputy 
from Esfahan, issued a warning in accordance with Article 75 of 
the Constitution that this motion entails a financial burden and 
is a violation of the Constitution. 
<H5>  Motion To Elect Members of the Commission To Reclaim the </H5>
Wages of Deputies From Dissolved Majleses 
  The second item on the agenda was the report from the first 
consultation of the Judicial and Legislative Affairs Commission 
concerning the Motion To Elect Members of the Commission To 
Reclaim the Wages of Deputies From Dissolved Majleses, the 
general form of which was not approved and was rejected. 
  It is worth mentioning that Article 1 of the motion states: 
"The chiefs of the Judicial Affairs Commission and the 
Accounting Court and the chief of the Majles Administrative 
Organization are designated as members of the commission 
mentioned in the Law on Procedures for Collecting the Wages Paid 
to Those Who Were Appointed as Deputies between 3/15/1342 [June 
5 1963] through 11/22/1357 [11 February 1979], enacted 5/19/1358 
[August 10 1979], and the amendment dated 3/25/1359 [15 June 
1980]." 
<H5>  Iran Joins the Maritime Search and Rescue Convention </H5>
  The next item on the agenda was the report from the Housing 
and Urban Construction Commission concerning the Bill To Add the 
Islamic Republic of Iran to the Maritime Search and Rescue 
Convention. The aforementioned bill was approved by the Majles. 
<H5>  Bill on Employment and Social Facilities for Wounded Veterans </H5>
  The next item on the agenda was the report from the first 
consultation of the Administrative and Employment Affairs 
Commission on the Bill on Employment and Social Facilities for 
Wounded Veterans of the Islamic Revolution, the general form of 
which was approved. 
  The aforementioned bill's goals include: 
  (a) creating the necessary conditions to preserve and extend 
the spiritual and ongoing presence of wounded veterans in 
economic and cultural settings 
  (b) supporting the aspirations, perpetuating the ideological 
and cultural activities of wounded veterans and improving their 
individual, family and social circumstances 
  (j) creating the ability to apply and coordinate the 
nation's 
administrative and employment regulations with the special 
bodily circumstances of wounded war veterans. 
  Rashidi, the commission's expert, said concerning this bill: 
The period allowed for the experimental implementation of this 
law, which was approved in the year 1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 
1991], has already expired, and the government has presented 
this bill to the Majles. 
  He then added: It is the duty of the government and the 
Majles to strive to alleviate the social deficiencies for our 
sacrificing wounded war veterans, who have expended their bodies 
and souls to preserve and guard the valuable achievements of the 
Islamic revolution, and who now have bodily and psychological 
defects. 
<H5>  Motion To Prohibit the Use of Satellite Antennas </H5>
  The Motion To Prohibit the Use of Satellite Antennas (Dish 
Antennas) was presented by a number of deputies as a 
single-urgency motion. Mr. Nateq-Nuri deemed it advisable to 
give priority consideration to this motion and to have it placed 
on the Majles agenda as an ordinary motion with priority. 
  It is worth mentioning in this regard that Mr. Nateq-Nuri 
said: This motion does not need an urgency rating, but I ask 
that it be given priority. 
  This motion, whose arrival was announced at the Wednesday 
open Majles session (yesterday), emphasis is given to the 
prohibition on importing, construction, distribution and use of 
the satellite antennas. 
  The motion states: The Ministry of the Interior is required 
to use the police to gather up satellite antennas in the 
shortest time possible, through the use of police forces. 
  The Ministry of the Interior is also required to use any 
possible means to prevent the importation, manufacture or 
distribution of satellite antennas, and, in the course of 
confiscating the aforementioned implements, to turn over the 
perpetrators to the competent courts. 
  In this bill, which was signed by about 20 deputies, 
penalties are provided for violators. 
<H5>  Views of Engineer Yusefpur Concerning the Motion To Prohibit </H5>
Satellite Dishes 
  Mr. Yusefpur, deputy chief of the Councils Commission and 
deputy from Ardel, discussed the Motion To Prohibit Satellite 
Dishes with our parliamentary correspondent. He said: Because 
satellite dishes are a new phenomenon in our country and because 
there is now no law of any kind concerning their use or 
prohibition, and because the executive organizations are now 
uncertain how to deal with them, a motion was prepared to permit 
individuals and organizations who need to use satellite dishes 
to perform their duties with authorization from the Ministry of 
Islamic Guidance. 
  He noted: Currently the use of satellite dishes is 
prohibited 
to all the people except in special cases in most Western and 
non-Islamic nations. We must realize that the Western nations 
are not willing to tolerate the slightest cultural phenomenon 
from us. How can we leave them free to freely spread various 
kinds of political and cultural propaganda in our country? 
  Discussing the important points in this bill, Mr. Yusefpur 
said: In this motion the unauthorized use of satellite dishes is 
prohibited, importers and producers will be punished, and the 
satellite antennas will be collected. 
  In conclusion he said: Some people believe that the 
phenomenon of satellite dishes cannot be physically opposed, but 
these people must be told that there is a way to fight any 
technical or specialist phenomenon that is produced.

  [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. The 
Majles met in open session yesterday chaired by Mr. 'Ali Akbar 
Nateq-Nuri and the deputies from Tehran, Khorramabad, Urmia, and 
Khorramshahr gave preagenda speeches. 
  Then the Majles took up its agenda, and we direct the 
attention of our esteemed readers to the detailed proceedings. 
<H5>  'Abbas Shibani, Deputy From Tehran </H5>
  The commands in the Koran and the speeches of the saints are 
not merely sermons. We ourselves must first act. 
  The first preagenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles 
session was Shibani, deputy from Tehran. During his speech he 
said: Instead of a preagenda speech, I wanted to observe 10 
minutes of silence. Perhaps this silence will be more expressive 
than my inexpressive remarks. I have admired the president of 
the republic for more than 35 years, and I have been obedient to 
the leader since before the Islamic revolution. 
  Continuing, the speaker added: Before anything else, I 
advise 
myself to be pious, for that is needed now more than at any 
other time. We are on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the 
Imam's death. We were unable to recognize that unique 
gentleman's concern for supporting Islam, the revolution, and 
the deprived and oppressed people, and we did not act on his 
advice in accordance with our duty to do so. 
  Continuing, Shibani said: Our old father, our Imam, and our 
leader, said that the people are our benefactors, but 
unfortunately our unsuitable performance has disappointed them 
in us and our revolution. Wasn't it his eternal cry to the 
people and especially to the officials, not to forget the 
greatest jihad, which is struggle with the base self? 
  The deputy from Tehran said that if the Imam was able to 
stand up against the superpowers, it was because he was master 
of himself. He said: If we do not see this ability in ourselves, 
it is because we are prisoners of our base selves. 
  Continuing, Shibani also added: Wasn't it Gandhi, the leader 
of the Indian people, who stood up to the English imperialists 
and said: I will wear my own handwoven burlap clothing, and I 
will not submit to the humiliation of using foreign goods? 
  The speaker discussed the fact that we consider ourselves 
Shiites and the nation of this Imam (peace be upon His Holiness 
'Ali). He said: Now the latest machinery and various kinds of 
foreign food and beverages are abundant in this land, and every 
year our indebtedness to others increases. 
  Shibani discussed the fact that as the managers of the 
Islamic government, we need first to develop ourselves. He said: 
What I am saying is that we should not treat the commands in the 
Koran and the speeches of the saints merely as sermons. We 
ourselves must first act. My purpose in making the request I 
made and am making of the president of the republic and that has 
been approved by the leader that he hold morality classes for me 
was that these matters be promoted so that the people will know 
what has been said to us and to what extent we have acted upon 
it. 
  Shibani added: Of course, I have a lifetime behind me and I 
do not have that much hope of reforming myself. My hopes are in 
the young generation and the Majles, so that we can review what 
has happened and change our procedures and policies. 
  The speaker asked that more attention be given to the 
reconstruction of Abadan and Khorramshahr. With regard to price 
controls, he said: Without Majles approval, no sector in the 
government or its companies has the right to increase prices, 
and the judiciary must help with this matter. If someone says 
this cannot be done, I say it can. Give me the authority and I 
will do it myself. Nonessential expenditures must be avoided, 
purchases must be made with care. There are many hospitals 
throughout the country whose return is no more than 20 percent. 
Instead of building new hospitals, let them equip these 
hospitals so that they can better answer to the needs of the 
people. 
  He discussed moral and cultural decadence. He said: You must 
first think of bread before you can promote faith. Do not fear 
satellites and antennas. You must train us in such a way that we 
will not use videos, television, and harmful programming. 
  At the end of his speech, the speaker asked the minister of 
cooperatives to try to consolidate consumer cooperatives in 
order to provide the people with goods at lower prices. 
<H5>  Akbar Farid, Deputy From Khorramabad </H5>
  I recommend that officials investigate the results of 
seminars, meetings, and guidelines without advance notification. 
  The next speaker was Farid, deputy from Khorramabad. In his 
speech he offered condolences on the anniversary of the 
martyrdom of the Iranian pilgrims to the House of God. With 
reference to the geographic position of the province of 
Lorestan, he said: This province, with all its characteristics, 
which are known to all, is at the top of the national 
deprivation table. Its deprivation is striking in all areas, 
including roads, education, industry, and classroom space, and 
the deprivation is more evident in the province's central 
municipality than it is in the other municipalities. 
  He added: The city's main streets are in poor condition and 
full of unemployed individuals, the old alleyways have not been 
improved, the entry and exit routes have not been widened, and 
due to their makeup these things show the deprivation all the 
more. 
  The deprivation is such that its dimensions in this city 
have 
been confirmed by all the dear ones who have been in this city 
and its environs. The deprivation in our city and province has a 
historical precedent, which revolves around the commitment, 
religious belief, honesty, and bravery of the people of this 
region. 
  The deputy from Khorramabad then discussed the struggles of 
the children of Lor. He said: After Reza Khan came to dominate 
the Lorestan region with thousands of tricks, plots, and 
deceptions, due to his fear of the children of Lor and the fact 
that he did not want the battles of Lorestan to have a name in 
the management system, with the help of his English bosses and 
their theorists he converted the tribal and religious values in 
Lorestan to antivalues, and turned the fate of the province of 
Lorestan over to a thousand families outside the province on the 
insulting grounds that the children of Lorestan are unable to be 
responsible for their own affairs because of their tribal and 
ethnic makeup. 
  He added: With the triumph of the Islamic revolution led by 
His Holiness the Imam (peace be upon him), the palace of 
oppression and despotism collapsed, the disgraceful ring of 
idolatry was defeated and the talents of the children of Lor 
flourished. A group found its way into the nation's universities 
and graduated with high-specialist degrees in various sciences. 
By order of the great Imam, a group also went to the war fronts 
of truth against falsehood to defend the gains of the revolution 
and the Islamic homeland. 
  He said that one of the factors in the success of a manager 
is understanding the work setting and the surrounding 
environment. He said: There are some schools of thought in 
management that say we should leave the administrative center 
and go to the cities, districts, and villages where special 
disruptions and malfunctions are sensed in administrative 
affairs, and this itself has weaknesses and vulnerabilities. In 
the cities, this mostly takes the form of coordination between 
the government and nongovernment offices. 
  He continued: Sometimes, to obtain a small loan, a 
government 
client goes from municipality to Tehran and back four or five 
times on dangerous roads at heavy expense and is ultimately 
faced with a rejection. Sometimes it is seen that an official is 
improperly assigned to a task because of his relationship with a 
deputy minister or a manager, without study or consideration of 
the relation between job and worker. After a short time he does 
things that not only cause him to be reprimanded, but also bring 
others into question. This takes on a different dimension and 
appearance under the influence of opportunists, whose numbers 
are not small. 
  I recommend, to study and monitor the issues and to 
alleviate 
the existing problems and difficulties, that we make unannounced 
and unofficial appearances at official gatherings, even wearing 
disguises if possible, in order to pursue the guidelines and 
results of their seminars and meetings and to see how they are 
being implemented in the cities and villages and where the work 
problems are. 
  Farid discussed the parliamentary aides. He said: One of the 
duties of these dear ones is to convey the information and 
logical requests of the deputies, which arise from the problems 
of the people, to the ministers, deputy ministers and 
organizations under the ministries. Some of the dear ones, 
willingly or not, fall short in transferring information 
intended to solve problems. 
<H5>  Nosrat Samadzadeh, Deputy From Urmia </H5>
  The third preagenda speaker was Samadzadeh, deputy from 
Urmia. During his speech he said: The experts have regarded the 
goal of economic adjustment and eliminating subsidies as being 
to direct capital and currency in circulation into the producing 
sectors and arriving at true prices. It was their belief that 
after the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan current 
capabilities and quality would increase, and that consequently 
the prices of goods would drop. 
  He added: During the plan, with a study of the market we see 
that the prices of goods and services increased by the day and 
sometimes by the hour, disturbing the people. 
  The reasons are: (1) The lack of executive guarantees in the 
policies of the plan and the lack of financial regulations in 
the government, the government's failure to intervene in the 
market for goods needed by the people, and the failure to 
control prices. (2) The banking facilities given to the 
government and private sector companies to invest were not spent 
on the goal, the percentage of currency in circulation increased 
and consequently the government, instead of guiding capital into 
production and definite activity, created a thriving market for 
gold and currency speculators and drove the nation's interests 
out of the production sector into trade. (3) The economy was not 
properly evaluated, and due to the unstable policy making in the 
economy, part of the country's labor capability was wasted. The 
Five-Year Plan must specify the productivity of investment. 
Finally, the consumption model was not in accordance with 
incomes. (4) More than 80 percent of the foreign exchange 
revenues were obtained from oil exports, and because of the 
conditions in world markets, the anticipated prices were not 
implemented and likewise there was no specific procedure for 
collecting taxes under the Five-Year Plan. (5) The lack of 
public participation in setting priorities, especially in 
national projects. Since the Islamic government is founded on 
the commands of religion and the votes of the public, and His 
Holiness the Imam gave special importance to public 
participation and today the exalted leader also emphasizes this 
important matter, therefore the people are the main ones setting 
the policy for the nation's executive organizations. He added: 
Unfortunately, the National Planning and Economic Policy Council 
deals with statistics and numbers. (6) The First Five-Year Plan 
only had the goal of growth. No attention was given to 
investment procedures aimed at procuring social justice and 
alleviating deprivation. In studying the Second Five-Year Plan, 
in addition to goals, attention must be given to assessment of 
the First Five-Year Plan and to the objections to it. In short, 
policy making, planning, investing, and even managing must be 
such that all the nation's high ability will be used, so we will 
ultimately, in the near future, be able to follow the exalted 
leader's guidance and get away from a one-product economy 
dependent on oil, which is the only way of salvation in order to 
reach true independence for the nation of the Islamic Republic. 
  The deputy from Urmia asked the president of the republic to 
think about the measures necessary to deal with the rising 
waters of Lake Urmia. 
  He continued: Due to the lack of agriculture and industry, 
the province of West Azarbaijan is deprived of huge national 
credits. 
  The speaker added: The Technical College and Urmia 
University 
as the only support for technical manpower training in the 
region, must receive special attention in order to develop the 
West Azarbaijan region. The current problems, such as equipping 
laboratories and factories, must be solved. 
  In conclusion, the deputy from Urmia congratulated sports 
officials on the province of West Azarbaijan volley ball team's 
victory. 
<H5>  Yunes Mohammadi, Deputy From Khorramshahr </H5>
  During the last 14 years the Majles has passed good laws, 
but 
it has acted weakly in the area of oversight. 
  The final preagenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles 
session was Mohammadi, deputy from Khorramshahr. During his 
speech, in connection with 3 Khordad [24 May] he discussed the 
anniversary of the liberation of Khorramshahr. He said: 
Khorramshahr is not just a city, it is a model and a symbol. It 
is a model of the power, greatness, and grandeur of the proud 
Muslim nation of Iran. With the liberation of Khorramshahr the 
enemies of Iran were politically and militarily demoralized. 
Today also, in commemorating this great day, we are teaching the 
lessons of moral heroism and courage to our children and we are 
reminding our enemies of the noble nation of Iran's 
steadfastness, sacrifice and courage. He discussed 7 Khordad [28 
May], the anniversary of the establishment of the Majles, the 
manifestation of the justice of 'Ali (peace be upon him). He 
said: The Majles must act in such a way that it will realize the 
desires and hopes of the late Imam, for the Imam said: "the 
Majles is at the head of affairs." 
  He continued: The Majles is also a bird with two wings, 
making laws and oversight. During the last 14 years the Majles 
has passed good laws, but it has acted weakly in the area of 
oversight. The Majles is the home of the nation and it must show 
this nation's determination, steadfastness, and greatness. 
Governments must always follow the Majles, and the Majles must 
not allow individuals, willingly or unwillingly, to abstain from 
acting on the law. 
  The speaker then discussed 14 Khordad [4 June], the 
anniversary of the death of the great Imam. He said: We must all 
keep the Imam's memory alive in our hearts forever. We must 
protect with our good work this sacred government, which is his 
trust, like a valuable trust. Recently the president of the 
republic said that the policies of the enemies of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran are to make the people of Iran lose hope and to 
despair, and to keep them from continuing on their path. 
  The deputy from Khorramshahr then discussed the that fact 
that pessimism and despair grow like a dangerous bacteria in a 
place where it is possible for them to develop. He said: We must 
destroy the circumstances and factors that cause pessimism to 
grow. In my view the following factors create the possibility 
for the growth of pessimism and despair: 
  (1) The nation's failure to recognize the government's 
services; 
  (2) the nation's lack of awareness of the great problems 
that 
surround our government; and 
  (3) the nation's failure to understand the nation's revenue 
situation. 
  He continued: Perhaps the people think the government has so 
much financial capability that it can meet all their 
expectations, but it is not this way. We have great problems 
with regard to revenues and the people must become aware of 
them. 
  (4) The failure to recognize the domestic and foreign 
enemies 
who act in various domestic and foreign dimensions, in various 
ways and in various political, military, moral and economic 
dimensions, and sometimes disguised as friends. 
  (5) The government's failure to deal decisively with the 
enemies of the system. 
  In this regard, he added: Those who are damaging the system 
in order to accumulate wealth and think only of their own 
interests especially have created this market situation, and 
moment by moment the prices of goods and services are going up 
without any reason. This is causing severe suffering among the 
people and has created circumstances to make the people 
pessimistic. 
  Continuing, the speaker added: The people are saying that a 
government that has stood up to America, the hypocrites, Saddam, 
and tens of domestic and foreign enemies can also defeat these 
economic enemies. The people want decisive government 
supervision in the market. At the end of his speech the deputy 
from Khorramshahr called for the alleviation of the economic 
problems in his electoral district. He said: Bandar-e 
Khorramshahr must be a protected port or it must be declared a 
free trade zone so this city can prosper. 
<H5>  Legislation </H5>
<H5>  Majles Amends Law on Abortion Enacted by the Interests </H5>
Discernment Council 
<H5>  Amendment Approved for Motion To Establish Files for </H5>
Registered Appeals Without a Record 
<H5>  Motion To Establish Files for Registered Appeals Without a </H5>
Record 
  The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles 
session was the report from the Judicial and Legislative Affairs 
Commission concerning the Motion To Establish Files for 
Registered Appeals Without a Record or Whose Protests Have Been 
Lost by the Judicial Authorities (returned from the Guardian 
Council), and the above amendment was approved. 
  Article 1 as amended: As of the date of this law's 
enactment, 
with regard to appeals concerning the principle or boundaries of 
property, which are sent to the relevant judicial authorities 
under Articles 16 and 20 of the Registry Law by the end of the 
year 1360 [20 March 1982] or which for any reason do not have an 
appeals record with the judicial authorities, the appellants or 
their legal representatives may, within no more than six months 
after the date this law goes into force, submit their appeals 
along with the necessary documents to the competent court. They 
must obtain the necessary affidavit to this effect and submit it 
to the registry office at the place where the property is 
located. If they do not file during this period and if there is 
no excuse justified under religious law, the appeal will be 
considered rejected. 
<H5>  Iran-Russia-Finland International Shipping Agreement </H5>
  The second item on the agenda was the report from the 
Housing 
and Urban Construction Commission concerning the Bill on the 
International Highway Shipping Agreement between the Government 
of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Government of the 
Federation of Russia (returned from the Guardian Council), for 
which the commission's amendment was approved by the deputies. 
  Amendment to Article 13, Paragraph 3, on the last line: will 
either be taken out of service under the supervision of the 
appropriate customs officials (the meaning of "taken out of 
service" is "turned away"), or will be given at no charge to the 
customs officials of the aforementioned side. 
  The third item on the agenda was the report from the Housing 
and Urban Construction Commission concerning the Bill on the 
International Highway Shipping Agreement between the Government 
of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Government of the 
Republic of Finland (returned from the Guardian Council), which 
was approved by the deputies. 
<H5>  Bill on the Uniform Retirement Pensions System </H5>
  The next item on the agenda was the report from the first 
consultation of the Administrative and Employment Affairs 
Commission concerning the Bill on the Uniform Retirement and 
Obligatory Service Pensions System, the general form of which 
was approved by a decisive majority of the deputies. 
  Rashidi, the commission's expert, said concerning this: The 
basic issue was that the retirement wages were not appropriate 
for the periods before and after service, and government 
employees were truly disturbed by the arrival of the time for 
retirement and even fled from it. The time they were to retire 
was the time their children were entering the universities, the 
time their children were getting married and other things, and 
therefore the drop in their wages disrupted their lives. 
  He then added: The ceiling on retirement pensions is about 
18,150 tumans, and those with academic credentials have specific 
ceilings. Henceforth, however, retirees will receive pensions in 
view of their years of service and their academic credentials. 
  Rashidi emphasized: Likewise, those who are already retired 
will have their payment ceilings raised under this law. 
<H5>  Law Amending Abortion Rules </H5>
  The fifth item on the agenda was the report from the first 
consultation of the Judicial and Legislative Affairs Commission 
concerning the Motion To Amend Note 6 of the Abortion Rules 
Amendment Law enacted 8/28/1371 [19 November 1992] by the 
Interests Discernment Council, the general form of which was 
approved. 
  The amendment to Note 6 states: "During a divorce requested 
by the wife demanding compensation for work that was not her 
responsibility under religious law, the court will first seek to 
meet the wife's demands through reconciliation, and if 
reconciliation fails, if conditions are set on financial matters 
in the marriage contract or the contract for dissolution, the 
court will act in accordance with that. Otherwise, whenever the 
divorce is requested by the wife and also if the request for the 
divorce does not arise from the wife's violation of her duties 
as a spouse or her bad morality and behavior, the court will act 
as follows: 
  A) If the wife has done tasks that were not her 
responsibility under religious law at the husband's order or 
without the intention of the work being voluntary, and if this 
is proven to the court, the court will calculate the equivalent 
value and order its payment before issuing the divorce decree. 
  B) In cases other than the one in Paragraph A, in view of 
the 
number of years of communal life and the types of jobs the wife 
has done in the husband's home and the husband's financial 
situation, the court will designate for the wife a sum as a 
forgiveness (evacuation) amount for the wife. It is worth 
mentioning that Paragraph A was added in the measure enacted by 
the Interests Discernment Council, and in the Majles motion the 
vote was taken after that paragraph was amended and Paragraph B 
was added. 
  It is worth mentioning that Mr. Mohammad 'Ali 
Movahedi-Kermani said in a constitutional memorandum: If the 
Majles wants to enact a motion or a bill, it must be within the 
limits of religious law and the Constitution. Enactments by the 
Interests Discernment Council is above this. This means that the 
Interests Discernment Council may approve a measure based on 
interests and it may even be outside the bounds of religious law 
and the Constitution. Can the Majles change a measure enacted by 
the Interests Discernment Council? This issue was studied in the 
Interests Discernment Council, and the gentlemen in the Guardian 
Council specified precisely that the Majles may not make this 
change. 
  Mr. Nateq-Nuri said in answer: This issue you are raising 
was 
discussed in the Interests Discernment Council, and no measure 
was adopted with regard to it. We also believe that the 
gentlemen in the Guardian Council must ultimately issue an 
opinion. 
  Then Mr. Shibani gave a speech. He said: Our poor 
performance 
has disappointed the people in the us and the revolution. Then 
the speaker of the Majles, Mr. Nateq-Nuri, said: Of course, 
whenever Mr. Shibani speaks, he is clearly either concerned, 
passionate or sincere, but sometimes his language is harsh, and 
that is also sincere. He should modify his comment that the 
people are all disappointed now. He himself does not even 
believe that the people have become disappointed in this way, he 
is just saying that they should be more careful. 
<H5>  Measures by Majles Commissions </H5>
<H5>  Amendment to Bill on Independence of Judicial Attorney's </H5>
Society 
  Paragraph "J" of the aforementioned article is amended as 
follows: In addition to being members for one term in the 
Judicial and Legislative Affairs Commission, Majles deputies 
must have a judicial bachelor's degree or at least four years 
experience teaching specialist classes in the law colleges or a 
certificate of completion of high-level studies from the Qom 
Seminary or five years judicial trial experience. Continuing 
below is Note 2, under which the society is required within six 
months to make a decision about requesting a certificate of 
on-the-job training or parliamentary membership. 
<H5>  Bill on Organizations, Duties, and Elections in the National </H5>
Islamic Councils and Mayoral Elections 
  Article 5 of this bill states: A council will be formed in 
each village with a majority of its members chosen from among 
the chosen representatives of the councils of the rural areas 
within the village limits, and if a member presented by the 
rural council for full membership is elected for membership in 
the village council, he will not cease to be a member of the 
rural council. This bill was approved in the National Councils 
and Domestic Affairs Commission with five sections and 103 
articles. 
<H5>  Bill To Add Iran to the Agreement Between Member Nations of </H5>
the Islamic Conference Organization To Support Guaranteed 
Investments 
  Based on Article 2, Section 2 of this bill, the parties to 
the agreement will authorize in accordance with their own laws 
the transfer of capital and its use among the countries and 
within their own domains in authorized areas of activity. The 
investments made must have sufficient support and security and 
the host country must provide the necessary facilities and 
incentives for the investors actively working in its territory. 
  The aforementioned bill was approved in the Joint Economic 
and Financial Affairs and Cooperatives Commission.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, 'Arafat's </F>
political, adviser, in Gaza, by Ya'aqov Ahime'ir from the weekly 
"Popolitiqa" talk show -- live, in English] 
  [Excerpts] [Ahime'ir] In a few years you will learn to 
read the Hebrew press, the Hebrew newspapers in Israel, but 
maybe you saw the headline of the newspaper YEDI'OT AHARONOT 
speaking about Saudi pressure on 'Arafat. The item says that 
'Arafat will have no control over the holy places, the sacred 
placed in Jerusalem. What is your reaction to this news? 
  [Sha'th] No, I really have no evidence at all that there is 
Saudi pressure on us to do anything. The Saudis are gradually 
building up their support for us. You know, after the Gulf war 
there was a period of strained relations and now they have come 
back to be supporters, and really increasing to a great extent 
and improving their relations with us. 
  [Ahime'ir] I see. Do they assist you financially? 
  [Sha'th] Yes, in the last Paris meeting they gave us $10 
million for the urgent recurrent expenses and they have already 
raised their level of contribution to $62 million for this year. 
  [Ahime'ir] Dr. Sha'th, do you think that all the Arabs, all 
the Muslims in the Muslim, world agree that 'Arafat will have 
control on the holy places in Jerusalem, Christian and Islamic 
sites in Jerusalem? 
  [Sha'th] The Christian and Islamic sites in Jerusalem are, 
of course, important for all Muslims and Christians in the 
world. But, once there is going to be a Palestinian 
responsibility in East Jerusalem, that responsibility should and 
will include protection of these holy sites. During the years, 
1,000 years or more of Muslim control of these areas, both 
Christian and Muslim sites were protected by whoever ruled 
Jerusalem. 
  [Ahime'ir] And not necessarily by 'Arafat or by the PLO. 
  [Sha'th] Well, the PLO will have control of East Jerusalem 
only when, after the permanent negotiations, it will be agreed 
to do so. If as a result of the permanent negotiations there 
will be an independent Palestinian state and East Jerusalem its 
capital, then he will have full control. But this is now 
awaiting the permanent settlement. [passage omitted] 
  [Ahime'ir] Mr. Sha'th, when will Chairman 'Arafat arrive in 
Jericho or in Gaza? 
  [Sha'th] This is one of those difficult things to predict. 
He has kept it up till now a secret. I really don't know. I 
think he probably, I am sure, will tell us a few days before his 
arrival so that everybody will prepare. But, up till now he has 
not given that signal. 
  [Ahime'ir] Do you think that he will come to Jericho or to 
Gaza this month? 
  [Sha'th] I had been predicting so. In fact, I have been 
telling people that, but this might not happen. It all depends 
on his schedule. 
  [Ahime'ir] My last question: When do you personally expect 
to visit Jerusalem? 
  [Sha'th] Well, I want to come to Jerusalem as soon as 
possible. I don't want my coming to Jerusalem to be a problem 
to anybody. This visit is of a highly personal nature. I think 
Jerusalem is the most beautiful city in the world and I would 
like to come and see it again. I have not been in Jerusalem 
since 1948 actually, and I have so many friends to visit. I 
would like to go to the al-Aqsa Mosque, but I'll do it in due 
course. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, "official in </F>
charge of planning and international cooperation in the 
Palestinian National Authority Council", in Gaza; by Ashraf 
'Abd-al-'Aziz, in Cairo; date not given; from the "Dialogue From 
Afar" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] ['Abd-al-'Aziz] What are the real reasons that made 
you cancel your visit to Jerusalem, which was planned for 
yesterday? 
  [Sha'th] Actually, there were two reasons. First, I had to 
return to Gaza to handle some issues, which would have made my 
trip to Jerusalem very short and I like to have enough time to 
see Jerusalem. Also I must add that the mere announcement of my 
trip to Jerusalem caused an enormous uproar in Israeli rightist 
circles and maybe in some Israeli Government circles. I was 
told that there were threats and there would be disturbances if 
I went to Jerusalem and that this would require my protection by 
1,000 Israeli policemen. I do not want to go to Jerusalem under 
the protection of Israeli policemen and this was another reason 
for postponing my visit to a later date. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] You had talks in Jericho yesterday with 
members of the Palestinian side. What happened in these talks? 
  [Sha'th] In fact, Jericho City differs from Gaza and this 
should be noted clearly. In Gaza, the Israeli forces left the 
greater part of the Gaza Strip, which is populated by one 
million people who never see an Israeli and are not subjected to 
any friction with the Israeli authorities. Gaza is rife with 
security and peace. 
  As for Jericho, the Israeli authorities are almost besieging 
the city and a number of roadblocks delay movement between the 
two parts of Jericho--Jericho and Nizzana. I spent a whole hour 
forcing the Israeli roadblock to open to let me pass along the 
main road between Jericho and Nizzana. I traveled by road to 
Allenby Bridge to be sure myself of what I had been told. 
Indeed, I became certain that the Israeli authorities prevent 
trucks and tourist buses from entering Jericho. This means that 
1,200 tourists are barred from Jericho every day, which actually 
means an economic catastrophe for this small city. When they 
set up roadblocks between Jericho and Nizzana, they bar 
agricultural goods from entering the market, which also means 
catastrophe. 
  The situation in Jericho is very worrying, because the 
Israeli authorities there are not implementing the agreement we 
had signed and are implementing it only in Gaza. The aim of my 
trip to Jericho was to acquaint myself first hand with these 
problems and to forward my demands to the Israeli leadership and 
say that things cannot go on like this in Jericho. I also spent 
the night with the liberated brothers whom the Israeli forces 
kept in Jericho City wrongly and in violation of the agreement. 
I visited all places to learn first hand how we can avert these 
problems so that Jericho can enjoy the same freedom, dignity, 
and security which Gaza enjoys. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] I have in front of me a statement in which 
you accuse Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin of committing 
flagrant violations of the peace accord that he signed with the 
PLO. How true is this statement? 
  [Sha'th] Yes, the statement is true and I said that they 
prevented me from going to Allenby Bridge and Nizzana City which 
is an inseparable part of the Jericho area. I experienced these 
violations first-hand. The agreement does not give them the 
right to set up any roadblocks between Jericho and Nizzana or 
between Jericho and Allenby Bridge. It does not give them the 
right to besiege Jericho and prevent the entry of vegetables or 
tourists to the city, nor the right to an economic (?blockade) 
and strangulation of the city. There are also other violations; 
they are behind in the issue of the prisoners, which I have 
mentioned. They should have released 5,000 by now and there are 
still about 1,000 who have not been released. 
  They have withdrawn on time and the Palestinian police 
forces 
also entered on time but there are other violations that have to 
be stopped immediately if we want the peace process to advance 
and succeed. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] What about Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat's return to the Palestinian territories? 
  [Sha'th] There are many considerations governing this and we 
hope he will be among us soon. But frankly, after visiting 
Jericho, I join those who advocate the postponement of his 
arrival until these problems have been resolved. I cannot 
imagine President 'Arafat facing what I saw with my own eyes in 
Jericho today. Of course, 'Arafat's trip will not be limited to 
Gaza and he is bound to go to Jericho. We have to solve these 
problems, face these Israeli violations, and tell the Israelis 
that they should rectify the situation. The entire world and 
the Israelis themselves must see that the situation has been 
corrected if they want this process to be a success. Once we 
resolve these problems, I believe that the arrival of brother 
Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] will be desirable from all aspects.

  [Text] Jericho, West Bank, June 20 (AFP) -- The Israeli 
army denied passage for a few hours to senior Palestinian 
official Nabil Sha'th at a checkpoint in the self-rule enclave 
of Jericho on Monday [20 June]. 
  Sha'th, who carries the portfolio of minister of 
international cooperation in the new Palestinian Authority, was 
let through later in the day after he contacted Amnon Shahaq, 
Israel's deputy chief of staff. 
  "Someone irresponsible thought of stopping me," Sha'th told 
reporters after meeting Palestinian security officials and 
foreign diplomats at police headquarters here. 
  "This is totally unacceptable to Palestinians and to the 
(Israeli-Palestinian) agreement. 
  "They have no right to stop us between Jericho and al-'Awja 
or between Jericho and the West Bank. This is against the 
agreement, how can they do that in peace time?" 
  Sha'th was stopped at a checkpoint on the edge of Jericho, 
heading for the Arab village of al-'Awja, at the northern edge 
of the Palestinian self-rule enclave. He returned to the town. 
  The main road between the checkpoint and al-'Awja is not 
part 
of the autonomous territory and crosses a Jewish settlement. 
However, it is patrolled by joint Israeli and Palestinian 
forces. 
  Sha'th echoed a complaint voiced by other Palestinian 
officials that the Israeli army regularly bars entry to tourist 
buses. 
  Around midday, Sha'th headed back from police HQ for 
al-'Awja 
and drove through the checkpoint in a convoy headed by an 
Israeli security van, part of a joint force with two Palestinian 
security vehicles. 
  At al-'Awja, the Israeli van pulled up outside the village 
as 
Sha'th went in to visit a youth center.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Security Adviser to Palestinian </F>
President Tells AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: Israel Obstructing 'Arafat's 
Speedy Return to Self-Rule Area"] 
  [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- A senior PLO official 
has accused Israel of putting obstacles in the way of President 
'Arafat's return to the self-rule area in a fitting manner that 
preserves the national dignity of the Palestinians and their 
president. 
  Mamduh Nawfal, security adviser to President 'Arafat, told 
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT over the telephone from his residence in 
Tunis: The Israelis have been notified of the date set for the 
Palestinian leadership's return to the homeland. It is the end 
of the month or the beginning of next month. 
  But the Israeli side is still refusing to respond to a 
number 
of Palestinian requests, first and foremost the evacuation of 
the Israeli Army from the crossing points to be used by the 
president's motorcade, not subjecting any of the leaders 
accompanying him to inspection, and lifting the ban on the 
completion of the small airfield in Jericho. The second point 
concerns approving the list of the 1,000 leadership and 
administration personnel making up the main bulk of the national 
administration's institutions, and the president's advisers and 
their offices. As for the third point representing an obstacle, 
that is that Israeli leaders are refusing to open up the Gaza 
and Jericho areas to the residents of the occupied West Bank to 
express their happiness and celebrate the entry of their 
historic leadership. 
  Nawfal pointed out that Israel has not changed many of the 
ways in which it deals with the Palestinians, and there is a 
delay in implementing the agreements concerning the release of 
the other prisoners and detainees, alleviating the hardship of 
residents of the other occupied towns and villages, and reducing 
the Army's and settlers' close contact with local residents. 
  Nawfal denied Israeli reports that he has entered the Gaza 
Strip to prepare a security plan for President 'Arafat's 
protection during his entry into his homeland. He said: "There 
are various agencies currently carrying out this task in Gaza 
and Jericho. When these procedures are completed, in addition to 
the removal of the Israeli obstacles I mentioned, we will all 
leave Tunisian territory with the president." 
  On filling the six seats in the Palestinian Authority 
Council, Nawfal said: "Consultations have reached their final 
stages, and all the names of the council's members will be 
announced 72 hours before the president's and leadership's 
return to the homeland." Nawfal said that the delay in 
announcing the full list of the council is not an obstacle to or 
a cause of the postponement of the Palestinian leadership's 
return to the self-rule area.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Palestinian Police Commander in Gaza </F>
Tells AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: I Have Not Misused Police Funds or 
Violated 'Arafat Instructions"] 
  [Text] Tunis, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Major General Nasr 
Yusuf, commander of the Palestinian police forces in Gaza, has 
strongly denied what some quarters said recently, namely that he 
has misused the funds allocated for Palestinian policemen's 
salaries, and that he has violated the instructions conveyed to 
him by Palestinian ambassador to Cairo Zuhdi al-Qidrah in this 
connection. 
  Maj. Gen. Yusuf, who met in Tunis yesterday with Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat, who had summoned him to Tunis, stressed 
to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that 'Arafat was keen to pay the policemen 
their allowances to face the high cost of living and the 
difficult economic conditions in Gaza and Jericho. 
  Maj. Gen. Yusuf, who was accompanied to Tunis by his 
assistant Brigadier Ziyad al-Atrash, added that he submitted to 
President 'Arafat, with whom he met yesterday separately, a 
comprehensive assessment of the previous stage and the present 
security conditions in the National Authority area. 
  He stressed that "we are going to adopt a new approach for 
the next stage." He declined to give any details about the 
nature of this approach. 
  Maj. Gen. Yusuf expressed his utmost discontent at and 
regret 
for the accusations made recently by prominent figures like 
Faysal al-Husayni and Jamil al-Tarifi with regard to what they 
termed a "Gaza-Jericho agreement for detainees." He described 
these claims as "absolutely untrue." He added: "We regret that 
some of the brothers who participated in all stages of the 
negotiations, and who have full knowledge of the details, are 
ignoring this reality and accusing us of concluding agreements 
with Israel which are not final." 
  He said that he and Ziyad al-Atrash had not signed a single 
letter with Israel, and that what some quarters have said is 
untrue. He said: "We are implementing an agreement, not 
conducting negotiations. We are liaison committees tasked with 
implementing an agreement signed by the Palestinian and Israeli 
leaderships. We are eager to secure credibility for the 
leadership by implementing what has been signed." 
  Maj. Gen. Yusuf stressed that he had not signed any 
documents 
regarding detainees, and that the clauses concerning detainees 
are stipulated in the Palestinian-Israeli agreement signed on 4 
May in Cairo. So "we have not signed any agreement on the 
detainees, nor have we been dragged into any negotiations with 
Israel in this connection. If that had been the case, we would 
have asked the leadership to do that. But we are field officers 
whose work is based on the field implementation of the agreement 
on the ground." 
  Concluding his statement, Maj. Gen. Yusuf stressed that he 
is 
going to return to his work in Gaza and Jericho in the next two 
days, refuting the rumors circulating in Tunis to the effect 
that 'Arafat is going to replace the police forces commander.

will hand over equipment valued at over one-half million 
[Egyptian] pounds to the Palestinian police tomorrow. Designed 
to be used in Gaza and Jericho, the equipment will be delivered 
to the Egyptian town of Rafah. 
  A statement by the embassy today said that the equipment is 
part of the assistance program of 105 million dollars, about 250 
million Egyptian pounds, which, during his visit to Gaza early 
this year, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd promised to the 
Palestinians over a three-year period. 
  The statement said that Britain will also contribute 20 
percent of the 50 million Sterling pounds, 250 million Egyptian 
pounds, earmarked by the European Union for development projects.

  [Text] Palestinians today demonstrated near the settlement 
of Netzarim in the Gaza Strip. Sami Abu-Samahdanah and a Fatah 
Hawks group, including the Abu-Sittah brothers who are suspected 
of having murdered settler Uri Megidish at the time, today 
blocked off the Netzarim junction and did not allow settlers' 
vehicles to cross through. Our correspondent Shlomi Eldar 
reports that Abu-Samahdanah organized the demonstration in 
protest against fire which he claimed was directed at him from 
Netzarim last night. He asked for the Palestinian police's 
intervention and filed a complaint with the Israeli-Palestinian 
liaison office. The demonstrators reopened the junction only 
after a senior Palestinian police officer promised he would take 
action to safeguard Palestinians moving near Jewish settlements. 
The Netzarim settlers and the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
spokesman deny that shots were fired from Netzarim yesterday.

  [Text] Gaza City, Gaza Strip, June 21 (AFP) -- The 
Palestinian police have arrested four PLO guerrillas, two on 
charges of killing a Jewish settler last year, according to a 
group of dissident fighters. 
  Two cousins, 'Amr and Raja' Abu-Sittah, are accused by 
Israel 
of murdering a Gaza settler on March 8, 1993. 
  "We appeal to the Palestinian authority to release those who 
our enemies want to kill," said the Abu-al-Rish group, named in 
memory of a guerrilla killed by the Israelis after he laid down 
his weapons for autonomy. 
  The small group is made up of fighters from the Hawks of 
Fatah, the mainstream PLO movement, who decided to pursue the 
armed struggle. 
  "Even though none of our men has carried out any acts or 
crimes against the peace process, the Palestinian police has 
arrested 'Amr and Raja' Abu-Sitta without reason, as well as 
'Ali Al-Dali et 'Abda-al-Salam Al-Qasaf," the group said in a 
statement. 
  "It is a crime to arrest any one who gave his life for the 
homeland, who resisted occupation with all his strength. We 
demand their release." 
  The Abu-Sittas enlisted in the new police force in May but 
walked out before the end of the month claiming they were not 
protected against Israeli agents who wanted to kill them.

  [Excerpts] Some 6,000 Palestinian prisoners serving 
sentences in Israeli prisons and IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
lock-up facilities have declared a hunger strike starting 
tomorrow and until further notice to protest the fact that they 
are not being released from jail. The leaders of the prisoners 
called on the inhabitants of the territories to boycott the 
celebrations for Yasir 'Arafat's arrival and to hoist black 
flags on the day of his visit in solidarity with the prisoners. 
Our correspondent Moti Amir reports: 
  [Begin Amir recording] The Palestinian prisoners decided to 
overtly fight the Israeli decision not to release them from jail 
and to protest the way Palestinian leaders have been dealing 
with their case. The leaders of the prisoners announced through 
the Palestinian Prisoner Club in Bethlehem that all the 
prisoners will go on a hunger strike tomorrow and called on the 
inhabitants of the territories to help them in their struggle. 
'Isa Karaki, head of the club, said the relatives of the 
prisoners will stage a demonstration outside the gates of the 
al-Aqsa camp in Jericho this coming Friday in solidarity with 
the prisoners. He added that the prisoners, including Fatah 
members, called on the inhabitants of the territories not to 
take part in the celebrations the day of 'Arafat's visit to 
Jericho, which may take place on 2 July. [passage omitted] 
  It should be noted that at least 1,300 Palestinian prisoners 
were given the choice to get out of prison by virtue of the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement, but they refused to sign a declaration 
that they recognize the agreement and undertake not to use 
violence against the peace process. [end recording]

  [Text] Palestine Ambassador to Jordan al-Tayyib 
'Abd-al-Rahim, who is minister of presidential affairs in the 
Palestinian National Authority, has welcomed the progress 
achieved so far on the Jordanian track in the peace process. He 
said what was achieved represents a Jordanian accomplishment and 
commitment to what had been agreed upon between Arab parties 
involved in the peace process. Mr. 'Abd-al-Rahim denied that 
negotiation on each track would lead to isolating one Arab party 
and leave Israel capable of imposing its conditions on it. He 
said such reasoning is not correct because there are constants 
and each Arab side seeks just and comprehensive peace. He 
added: No final peace treaties before each track solves issues 
related to it. He said what has been achieved on the Jordanian 
track supports the Palestinian track, stressing accumulative 
achievements on each track constitute support for the other 
tracks. 
  Mr. 'Abd-al-Rahim explained that achieving progress on the 
Jordanian track would generate further breakthroughs on the 
Palestinian track and would push the Syrian and Lebanese track 
forward. The Palestinian official said the progress on the 
Jordanian track spurred underway international efforts for 
scoring progress on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks. He paid 
tribute to Jordan's support of the Palestinian side in the field 
of deepening the Palestinian track and crystallizing the 
Palestinian identity.

  [Excerpt] The Saudi authorities have clarified to Yasir 
'Arafat in no uncertain terms that the Muslim holy sites in 
Jerusalem are not the PLO's property but that of the entire Arab 
nation, with Saudi Arabia as its center. 
  This is the reason 'Arafat is delaying his arrival in 
Jericho, as prior to the Saudis' issuing their warning, 'Arafat 
had stated on several occasions that after visiting Jericho, he 
would undertake a prayer pilgrimage to the Muslim holy sites on 
the Temple Mount. 
  This declaration alarmed the Saudi authorities, who feared 
that 'Arafat would try to create "facts on the ground," and 
consequently they decided to put him in his place. [passage

  [Text] Ibrahim Ghawshah, spokesman for the Islamic 
Resistance Movement, Hamas, reiterated in Damascus today his 
objection to the agreements signed recently between Israel and 
the Palestinians and between Israel and Jordan. He said: We 
reject the defeatist policy that began in Madrid, Oslo, and 
Cairo and ended now in Amman, because these policies aim at 
relinquishing the rights and lands of the Palestinian people. 
  Ghawshah made this statement before the meeting of the 10 
Palestinian factions that oppose the self-rule agreement. 
Palestinian sources said the conferees will discuss in this 
meeting the situation in the self-rule territories and in all 
territories still under occupation.

  [Text] Gaza, QUDS PRESS -- A Palestinian media official has 
said Palestinian radio and television will begin experimental 
transmissions on the first of July. The radio will temporarily 
transmit six to eight hours daily and television about four 
hours daily. 
  Engineer Hisham Makki, general coordinator of radio and 
television in the Gaza Strip, said Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat has agreed to a request by Radwan Abu-'Ayyash, official 
in charge of the radio and television corporation, to use the 
Palestinian police building as a temporary office for the 
corporation. He added that one temporary studio for radio 
transmissions and another for the production of light television 
programs are being built in coordination with the Jericho 
municipality. 
  He said Abu-'Ayyash has received donations from Arab and 
foreign countries in the form of equipment and funds. Germany, 
he said, offered to build a small studio and to pay the salaries 
of 15-30 persons working in it for one year. 
  In a statement to QUDS PRESS, Makki, who had earlier worked 
for television stations in Jordan, Abu Dhabi, and Morocco, said 
experimental transmissions will begin on 1 July. He added that 
a questionnaire has been distributed among the citizens in the 
occupied Arab territories to determine transmission times 
suitable for them. 
  He said work at the radio and television corporation will be 
governed by the need to safeguard principles, ethics, religion, 
and the Islamic creed. He added: The television will be the 
property of all the Palestinian people, as well as their mirror. 
It will not belong to any party and will be open for 
participation by all qualified and experienced parties. He said 
cultural, social, and political programs, as well as family 
programs and everything that pertains to the Palestinian affairs 
will be presented. 
  Makki said he intends to prepare a program called "The Vigil 
Eye" to be presented by the public relations and moral guidance 
department of the Palestinian national security forces. The 
program will deal with police news and include reportage on 
their work as well as interviews. It will also deal with the 
conditions of prisoners. 
  He emphasized that Palestinian television, in cooperation 
with the second channel of the French television, will cover the 
special occasion of PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat's arrival in the 
self-rule areas, under the name of the Palestinian Radio and 
Television Corporation.

  [Text] Cairo, 21 Jun (MENA) -- Following his meeting with 
President Mubarak today, Yemeni Presidential Council Member 
'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani expressed his pleasure, noting that 
he had conveyed a message to President Mubarak from Lieutenant 
General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih on the present situation in Yemen 
and bilateral ties, which he described as strong and solid. 
  The Yemeni official hoped the Yemeni problems would remain 
among the Yemenis alone. If foreign intervention stops, we will 
be better able to solve the Yemeni problems through dialogue, he 
said, noting that there was a dialogue for nine months before 
military operations broke out. 
  He added that the Yemeni Government is prepared to continue 
that dialogue and stop all military operations, provided that 
the other side stops and abides by the cease-fire. 
  'Abd-al-Ghani pointed out that the Yemeni Government has 
repeatedly announced a cease-fire, but the other side has always 
violated it and not respected it. He reiterated his country's 
compliance with the UN Security Council resolution, affirming 
that they are doing their utmost to facilitate the mission of 
the UN Secretary General's envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi. He added 
that his government has voiced its readiness to cooperate with 
all the parties in stopping the fighting in the Republic of 
Yemen and its readiness to sit with the other side in any place 
in the Republic of Yemen to resolve the present situation 
peacefully. 
  Asked to comment on the recent U.S. statement on the 
situation in Yemen, he said: We have always abided by the 
cease-fire and are prepared to stop fighting immediately if the 
other side complies. We are also prepared to sit at the 
negotiating table within the framework of legitimacy and the 
Republic of Yemen, he added. 
  Responding to a question on north Yemen's position on the 
presence of UN observers, the Yemeni president's envoy said that 
the UN Security Council resolution does not provide for the 
presence of international observers. He said: To spare the 
blood of the Yemeni people, we suggested to the UN secretary 
general's envoy the enhancement of the role of the Military 
Committee that was formed by Yemenis in the past, and which 
included the Sultanate of Oman, Jordan, and the U.S. and French 
military attaches in Sanaa. We are willing to expand this 
committee in order to work for a cease-fire through it. That 
committee, which is actually in existence, can monitor the 
suspension of military operations until a cease-fire is 
enforced, he said. 
  'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani thanked President Mubarak and 
big sister Egypt for its constant efforts to stop the loss of 
Arab blood and for its eagerness to establish peace and 
stability in Yemen and the entire Arab region. 
  Asked whether it is possible to hold a referendum on unity 
in 
south Yemen, the presidential envoy said that unity was 
established by popular decision and that such a referendum was 
conducted under the umbrella of the multiparty system and 
political pluralism. Noting that the results of the referendum 
reflected support for unity by an overwhelming majority, he said 
that "the secessionists are a few who do not represent Yemen and 
want to impose secession by force." 
  The Yemeni envoy added that it is up to the Yemeni people to 
decide. Had the Yemeni people not protected unity, it would not 
have existed in its present form, as represented by the 
legitimate forces' control over most of the country. He 
emphasized that these forces are capable of silencing "the 
rebels" wherever they might be and settling the matter 
militarily if they want. "But they do not want to shed more 
blood," he said. 
  In an implicit reference to Aden, 'Abd-al-Ghani accused the 
other side of striking at vital installations and petroleum 
establishments. The last thing they did was bombard the trade 
center in Mocha and the adjacent city, which led to the 
martyrdom of 17 persons and the injury of more than 30 persons, 
he said. 
  Commenting on President Mubarak's ideas during the meeting 
that continued for well over two hours, the Yemeni envoy said: 
President Mubarak put forward valuable and useful ideas that 
all focused on stopping the bloodshed and turning to dialogue. 
I will convey these ideas to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. 
  Stating that he would convey the message fully to President 
Salih, 'Abd-al-Ghani expressed his optimism that the ideas 
President Mubarak put forward would have a positive impact in 
the future. 
  We hope all Arab brothers will help us stop fighting and sit 
at the negotiating table. They can also help us by refraining 
from interfering politically in the problem, either by Arabizing 
or internationalizing the issue, he stressed. 
  Touching on the role of the Arab League, the Yemeni envoy 
said: We are against subjecting any internal Yemeni affair to 
discussion at an Arab or international forum, because the 
League's Constitution does not entitle it to look into the 
internal affairs of any state. Yemen is a founder of the Arab 
League and a signatory of its Charter, he said, adding: We have 
explained that this issue is none of the League's business. We 
are not belittling the League; we are respecting its Charter, he 
said, stating that the UN Charter as well does not entitle the 
organization to look into states' internal affairs.

  [Text] Cairo, 20 Jun (MENA) -- Today the Military 
Prosecutor's Office demanded the death penalty for defendants 
number one to five in the case pertaining to the attempted 
assassination of Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi. There are 17 
defendants in the case, two of them fugitives. The first five 
defendants have been named as Muhammad Rashad 'Abd-al-Hamid 
Hijazi, Muhammad 'Abd-al-'Alim Muhammad Khalifah, Mas'ud 
al-'Arif Ibrahim, Tariq Ahmad 'Abd-al- Hamid, and Usamah 
Muhammad Rashad (a fugitive). 
  The prosecution also demanded stiff penalties for the 
remaining defendants in the case. 
  The representative of the Military Prosecutor's Office told 
the court that the defendants attempted to kill Information 
Minister Safwat al-Sharif three times, they made two attempts on 
the life of Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi, and they tried to 
assassinate UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus-Ghali. 
  The prosecution reviewed the facts pertaining to the 
establishment of the organization to which the defendants 
belong, the criminal conspiracy they concluded, and the training 
they undertook in the use of weapons and explosives. 
  The prosecution said that the defendants received large sums 
of money from abroad, they provided the banks through which the 
funds were transferred with false names. They used the money 
thus received to rent apartments and to purchase vehicles and 
plots of land on which to build hideouts, weapons, and 
explosives. 
  The representative of the Military Prosecutor's Office said 
that the defendants have been divided into two groups. 
Defendants number one through nine are in the first group and 
defendants number ten through seventeen are in the second. 
  He said the members of the first group were recruited by the 
terrorists Nazih Nushi Rashid and 'Adil 'Awad Siyam. Rashid was 
killed during the attack on the interior minister and Siyam was 
recently killed in a police ambush in Cairo's al-Munib area. 
  He added that the organization's members purchased a tract 
of 
land in Bilbays in al-Sharqiyah Governorate where they built a 
hideout with cells for holding Egyptian and foreign hostages. 
  They bought a plot of land on the Suez road to build another 
hideout. Their hideouts were mainly found in al-Jizah area and 
Bilbays in al-Sharqiyah Governorate. 
  The representative of the Military Prosecutor's Office told 
the court that the defendants gave their own interpretations of 
some of the Koran's chapters and sayings of the prophet in a way 
that agreed with their ideology, which is based on murder, 
accusing the head of state and his aides of apostasy, and 
seeking to overthrow the government by force. He affirmed that 
Islamic shari'ah does not approve of their ideology, which 
advocates murder, bombings, and the killing of innocent men, 
women, and children. 
  The prosecutor said that the first terrorist act they 
carried 
out was the murder of a dissident member called 'Adil Anwar. 
They ambushed him in front of his house. After that they 
planted an explosive device at the al-Jazirah Youth Center in 
order to kill several police officers during their daily 
physical training session. 
  He added that when they tried to kill the interior minister, 
they rigged a motorcycle with explosives. The explosion caused 
the death of two members of the organization, Diya' Mahmud Hafiz 
and Nushi Rashid. 
  The prosecutor related how they killed Ahmad Yahya, the 
first 
witness in the case pertaining to the attempt on the prime 
minister's life, in a car showroom. 
  He explained how the defendants stole a Fiat 128 from in 
front of a church in al-Fajjalah and used it in the murder 
attack on Ahmad Yahya. Later the terrorist 'Adil 'Awad Siyam 
was killed in the same car in al-Munib area. 
  The prosecutor pointed out that the second group of 
defendants concluded a criminal conspiracy with the first group 
and provided them with weapons and ammunition for their 
operations. They also supplied them with cylinders to build 
explosive devices. 
  The prosecutor told the court: In this case we are not 
discussing a particular ideology or putting a system of thought 
on trial. We are examining concrete facts comprising criminal 
conspiracy to commit premeditated murders, membership of an 
illegal group with the aim of carrying out assassinations, and 
possession of weapons, explosives, and forged documents. 
  The Military Court adjourned the case until 25 June when the 
defense counsel will sum up the case.

  [Text] The National Dialogue Preparatory Committee issued a 
report today listing its proposals and recommendations for the 
National Dialogue General Congress. Specifying the national, 
legitimate groups that President Husni Mubarak will invite to 
attend the congress, the committee recommended inviting 
representatives of the political parties, the People's Assembly 
and Consultative Council, professional associations, the General 
Labor Federation, specialized national councils, the 
universities, university faculty clubs, the media, writers, 
research centers, and scientific research institutes; 
individuals who have won state prizes; women's and popular 
societies; and people concerned with children's, youth, and 
sports affairs. 
  The Preparatory Committee also recommended that 
representatives of the following groups be invited: student 
federations, local government councils, chambers of commerce, 
industrial federations, banks, economists, agricultural 
cooperatives, and people concerned with family planning and the 
anti-illiteracy campaign. 
  It also recommended inviting a group of public figures and 
cabinet members. 
  The Preparatory Committee recommended that every political 
party be represented by four members, one of whom would be the 
party leader. 
  Regarding the working method and the organization of the 
National Dialogue General Congress, the Preparatory Committee 
recommended that the congress should meet to approve the 
committee's recommendations and then divide itself into three 
main committees: the Political Committee, the Social and 
Cultural Committee, and the Economic Committee. Every congress 
member would choose the committee he would like to join. He 
would list this as his first choice, and then another committee 
as his second. 
  The National Dialogue Preparatory Committee recommended that 
every political party should have the right to attend the 
meetings of any of the three major committees. Every committee 
would then elect a moderator who would organize the debates and 
the committee's work. 
  The Preparatory Committee stated that the moderator of each 
committee should have the right to summon any official to appear 
before it in line with the committee's request. 
  The Preparatory Committee proposed that the National 
Dialogue 
General Congress should have an office staff consisting of its 
Moderator General, appointed by President Husni Mubarak, the 
elected moderators of the three committees, and three other 
members to be selected by the president from among the leaders 
and representatives of the political parties participating in 
the congress. The office staff would oversee the activities of 
the congress. 
  Concerning the issues that the congress will debate, the 
Preparatory Committee decided that the Political Committee would 
discuss the revision and amendment of the law pertaining to the 
exercise of political rights, the fight against extremism and 
terrorism, and the revision and amendment of the law organizing 
the powers and responsibilities of the Socialist Prosecutor. 
  The Preparatory Committee recommended that bills under 
discussion and the draft general budget should be submitted to 
the Consultative Council prior to their discussion by the 
People's Assembly. This would be in line with the recent 
tendency to give legislative powers to the Consultative Council, 
which would mean adopting a two-chamber system when discussing 
and passing bills. 
  With regard to the economy, the Preparatory Committee 
recommended that the National Dialogue General Congress debate 
issues pertaining to continuing the economic reform process 
toward the attainment of a market economy, while at the same 
time specifying the state's role in this transformation. 
  The Preparatory Committee recommended the elimination of all 
obstacles hindering economic development and investment. It 
called for providing backing for cooperatives and encouraging 
the citizens to participate in industrial and agricultural 
economic development plans. 
  The Preparatory Committee's report stressed the importance 
of 
paying more attention to exports, regarding this as a strategic 
objective. It urged combating deviant practices, economic 
corruption, and the theft of public wealth. It recommended 
greater backing for domestic industry and agriculture vis-a-vis 
foreign competition. 
  The National Dialogue Preparatory Committee recommended that 
the Social and Cultural Committee debate the future of education 
in Egypt, the anti-illiteracy campaign, population affairs and 
family planning, and human health. 
  The committee emphasized the need to confront violence, 
fanaticism, and terrorism. 
  It called for developing rural areas and creating a balance 
between them and urban areas.

  [Text] An IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldier was killed, 
a second soldier sustained moderate wounds, and two others were 
lightly injured this afternoon by terrorist fire directed at an 
IDF unit in south Lebanon. Our Army affairs correspondent Yariv 
Ben-Yehuda reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Ben-Yahuda] Sergeant No'am Simha, 21, 
from 
Kibbutz Rosh Haniqra was killed this afternoon in south Lebanon. 
Three other soldiers were wounded, one moderately and two 
lightly. The casualties were soldiers in the Nahal Brigade who 
were part of a convoy that was making its way to the outpost at 
Beaufort Castle. The supply convoy consisted of a water tanker, 
several trucks, and armored personnel carriers. 
  The road leading to the outpost is very steep, rising 700 
meters above sea level. Before they reached the outpost, when 
most of the unit was making its way on foot, the terrorists 
fired antitank Sagger missiles and mortar bombs at the convoy 
and the outpost. One of the soldiers was killed by a missile 
and three others were wounded, one moderately and two lightly. 
  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin reacted to the incident, saying 
it was a painful incident but did not mean an exacerbation of 
the tension on the northern border. 
  [Rabin] Unfortunately there was an incident, but this is not 
an exacerbation of the situation. I cannot say that it deviates 
from other incidents to date, only that the outcome is more 
painful. [end recording]

    [Editorial report] Beirut AL-'AHD in Arabic devotes its 
entire 3 June 15-page issue to the Israeli air raids against a 
Hizballah training camp in Ba'labakk on 2 June. 
  On page 2, the paper publishes the names of 26 people killed 
and 40 wounded in the raids. 
  On page 3, AL-'AHD publishes an approximately 1,000-word 
statement issued by Hizballah in the wake of the Israeli raids. 
The statement says that "the Zionist enemy, backed militarily, 
politically, and morally by global arrogance, is waging a 
vicious war against our homeland, people, livelihood, and 
waters." The statement adds that "the enemy has been using the 
so-called peace negotiations as a way to undermine our society 
and nation. While America, the archsatan and the Zionists' 
principal ally, is demanding that in the name of negotiations 
and peace the Arabs and Muslims give up their mainstays of power 
and lay down their arms in return for eliminating the sources of 
tension--as Washington puts it--America at the same time 
declares its commitment to maintain the Zionist enemy's 
superiority and defend its security. Washington's objective is 
to destroy our nation and the Resistance and plunder our 
resources." 
  On the same page, the paper publishes an approximately 
400-word statement by head of the Hizballah Political Bureau 
al-Hajj Husayn Khalil commenting on the Israeli raids. Khalil 
says "the continuing Zionist attacks on our land, people, 
plantations, and waters-- attacks culminating in the treacherous 
aggression against Ba'labakk early today--are equivocal evidence 
that the decision to participate in the peace negotiations was 
wrong. Everyone realizes that Lebanon's participation in the 
negotiations continues to give Israel pretexts and excuses to 
pursue its policy of terrorism. Khalil goes on to say that "all 
officials, regardless of their positions, are called upon to 
take a responsible, firm stand toward the deep wound inflicted 
by the Zionist aggression and to withdraw from the negotiations 
indefintely." 
  On the same page, AL-'AHD publishes an approximately 
450-word 
eulogy delivered by Hizballah Secretary General Nasrallah. 
After exalting the martyrs, Nasrallah says that "the bestial 
Zionist aggression today will only increase our reliance on 
Almighty God and will make us more determined to forge ahead 
along the road of jihad regardless of sacrifices." 
  On page 4, AL-'AHD publishes the approximately 1,300-word 
eulogy delivered by Ayatollah Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah in honor 
of the souls of those who fell as a result of the Israeli raids 
on Ba'labakk. Fadlallah says: "As Muslims, mujahidin, and 
oppressed people, we decided there is no place for Israel among 
us, and that global arrogance will no longer have influence on 
our positions. Israel might win several rounds, and global 
arrogance might win several positions, but it is justice that 
will win in the end." Fadlallah continues that "the United 
States is a wolf that devours man, peace, and life. We know 
that every Israeli bullet is in fact an American bullet directed 
at the chests of the oppressed and the entire people." He adds: 
"We cannot accept the United States as a friend, no matter how 
events might develop. The United States will never be a friend 
of the Arabs and Muslims nor a friend of the oppressed." 
  On page 5, AL-'AHD publishes an approximately 1,500-word 
analysis by Ja'far Fadlallah on the Israeli aggression and the 
options to confront it. The writer says that the Israeli enemy 
"is pursuing a scorched earth policy to force the people to 
emigrate after losing the sources of their livelihoods and to 
spread an atmosphere of instability and tension that will create 
a vacuum." The writer adds that the Israeli enemy "aims to put 
the blame on the resistance and to instigate divisions and make 
the people abandon the resistance. This is an old strategy that 
the Zionist entity has been trying to implement by all means." 
Fadlallah continues that "the Zionist escalation is aimed at 
the Lebanese authorities, who would have quickly responded to 
the contents and conditions of the Zionist message if it had 
freedom of action. The substance of the message is that 
reliance on Syrian support will not guarantee protection and 
internal stability. This is obvious from the fact that the long 
Zionist arm can penetrate any area in Lebanon." 
  On pages 10 to 13, the paper publishes an approximately 
5,500-word selection of reactions by various organizations, 
officials, and deputies to the Israeli raids on Ba'labakk. The 
Islamic Revolutionary Army Organization for the Liberation of 
Palestine [Munazzamat al-jaysh al-thawri al-islami li tahrir 
Filastin] denounces the aggression and says that "it is 
confirmation of the Zionist capitulationist negotiations with 
traitors like 'Arafat and those panting for an illusionary peace 
with the Zionist entity." The Popular Front for the Liberation 
of Palestine-General Command says that "the new Zionist 
aggression is a manifestation of the provisions of the 
Oslo-Cairo Agreement and is aimed at the forces rejecting the 
U.S.-Zionist designs of hegemony." The General Secretariat of 
the Union Party "calls on the Lebanese Government to stop 
negotiations in view of this continuous aggression." 
  On page 14, AL-'AHD publishes an approximately 400-word 
report on an interview given by Hizballah Deputy Secretary 
General Shaykh Na'im Qasim to the BBC's "Other Opinions" 
program. While denying that Hizballah is holding Israeli pilot 
Ron Arad, Qasim says: "We have two Israeli soldiers; we do not 
deny this. They were captured during an Israeli commando 
operation in the south in 1986, and their names are known."

chairman of the Higher Islamic Shiite Council, has stated that 
the continued occupation of south Lebanon is like having the 
capital itself occupied, in addition to the Presidential Palace, 
the Prime Minister's Office, the Chamber of Deputies, and all 
Christian patriarchial seats in the country. 
  His eminence remarked that he opposes the establishment of 
an 
Islamic republic in Lebanon because the country is comprised of 
Muslims and Christians. He said an Islamic republic would not be 
conducive to the security of either the Muslim or Christian 
communities in Lebanon.

  [Text] Kuwait, 19 Jun (KUNA) -- Admiral Sir Benjamin 
Bathurst, British chief of the Naval Staff, will arrive here 
this evening on a two-day official visit to Kuwait during which 
he will discuss the issue of Kuwait's security and the joint 
military exercises with the Kuwaiti officials. 
  The British Embassy in Kuwait said in a statement today, of 
which KUNA has received a copy, that this visit is a new model 
for the strong ties between the two Navies which have been 
strengthened by the principal role played by these forces during 
the war to liberate the State of Kuwait. 
  The embassy added that this visit confirms the United 
Kingdom's continued concern for the security of Kuwait. 
  It pointed out that the visiting admiral will discuss the 
continued rounds of joint military exercises between Kuwaiti 
military ships and the royal ships of the Armilla Patrol in the 
Gulf. 
  The forthcoming exercises of these forces are scheduled to 
take place next September during the visit of HMS Cornwall. 
  During his visit, Admiral Bathurst will meet with Defense 
Minister Shaykh Ahmad al-Hamud, General 'Ali Mu'min, chief of 
the general staff, and Dr. Hamud al-'Utaybi, under secretary at 
the Defense Ministry. 
  Admiral Bathurst will also meet with Commander Muhammad 
Yaqut 
al-Fayruz, deputy-commander of the Kuwaiti Navy, during his 
visit to the naval base in al-Julay'ah. 
  It is worth mentioning that the United States, Britain, 
France, and Russia have signed defense agreements with Kuwait 
since the end of the war to liberate the State of Kuwait in 
February 1991.

  [Excerpts] Kuwait, 20 June (KUNA) -- Admiral Sir Benjamin 
Bathurst, chief of the Naval Staff of the British Royal Navy, 
said here today that the British presence in the region will 
continue as long as there is a need for it. 
  He described the Kuwaiti naval base in Ras al-Qulaya'h as 
"one of the most advanced in the world." 
  Bathurst told a news conference that the aim of his current 
visit to Kuwait is to continue developing strong ties between 
the two countries in the defense field, especially in the naval 
sphere. 
  Bathurst, who is visiting Kuwait as part of a Gulf tour 
which 
will include the Sultanate of Oman and the United Arab Emirates, 
stressed Britain's strong commitment to continue protecting Arab 
Gulf security in the future and to continue its military 
presence as long as the situation requires it. 
  This morning Bathurst met Defense Minister Shaykh Ahmad 
al-Hamud al-Sabah and Major General 'Ali al-Mu'men [name as 
received], General Chief of Staff. [passage omitted] 
  The British Royal Navy chief of staff said his talks with 
Kuwaiti officials concentrated on issues related to Kuwaiti 
naval forces and Kuwait's intention to buy patrol boats. He 
stated that the talks also dealt with joint exercises. The 
British-Kuwaiti exercises, he said, will take place in September. 
  "We have to take every opportunity to carry out joint 
exercises. I hope that joint exercises with Arab Gulf 
Cooperation Council states and coalition forces will take place 
in the future," the British naval commander said. 
  "There was an emphasis on training members of the Kuwaiti 
naval forces in the United Kingdom. I welcome the presence of 
members of the Kuwaiti Navy at technical courses, from the 
highest to the lowest levels." 
  Bathurst clarified that the talks gave him the opportunity 
to express the United Kingdom's support for Security Council 
resolutions on sanctions against the Iraqi regime. 
  "The Iraqi Navy still has some capabilities, particularly 
missiles, which still pose a threat, but the situation will 
remain under control as long as we are cautious and maintain our 
presence in the region," Bathurst said. 
  "The United Kingdom will continue to raise the issue of 
Kuwaiti prisoners at the Security Council." 
  He said the talks also dealt with the conflict in Yemen and 
stressed Britain's support for Security Council Resolution 924, 
calling for an immediate cease-fire and the sending of 
international observers. 
  Bathurst is expected to leave Kuwait for Britain tomorrow 
morning, ending his Gulf tour. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 20 Jun (MENA) -- Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa 
has announced that efforts and contacts to conclude a lasting 
cease-fire in Yemen are continuing. He pointed out that he had 
met with the UN secretary general's envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, to 
discuss this issue and added that the contacts that Egypt is 
conducting seek a cease-fire agreement. 
  The foreign minister continued: "We have not lost hope of 
reaching a cease-fire agreement." 
  He said that the Yemeni issue is "complicated and requires 
great efforts." 
  Musa added that a big gap still separates the positions of 
the warring Yemeni parties and there are several reasons that 
still preclude an agreement. He said this requires further 
efforts by Egypt and the United Nations to reach a solution. 
  Musa said he hopes the fighting in Yemen will not escalate 
in 
such a way as to harm the prospects of "achieving a breakthrough 
rather than complicating the matter further". 
  Noting the need to protect the Yemeni citizens in various 
towns, he said current efforts are concentrating on ending the 
fighting, and Egypt is contacting the United Nations and other 
parties for this purpose.

<F P=106> [Interview with 'Abdallah al-Akwa', spokesman for the north </F>
Yemeni delegation visiting Cairo, by Shadiyah Riyad; date not 
given; from "The Talking Newspaper" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Riyad] Mr. al-Akwa', Lakhdar Brahimi, envoy of Dr. 
Butrus-Ghali, has not succeeded in arranging a meeting between 
the two [north and south Yemeni] sides. Nor has he succeeded in 
attaining an agreement over a mechanism for observing a 
cease-fire. Do you see this as a failure of Lakhdar Brahimi's 
mission? 
  [Al-Akwa'] First of all, I thank you for this interview. In 
the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. I wish to 
comment on the description given to us as being the Sanaa 
delegation. We did not come here in the capacity of a 
delegation representing only Sanaa but as a delegation 
representing the country's ruling three-party coalition, the 
General People's Congress, the Yemeni Reform Grouping, and the 
Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]. We came to Cairo on this basis 
and in order to meet with the representatives of the third 
coalition partner, the YSP. When we arrived, however, we 
discovered that they were insisting that they represented an 
independent state. This is of course impractical and 
unacceptable. 
  [Riyad] 'Abdallah al-Asnaj [foreign minister in south Yemen] 
has declared that the coalition delegation, as you have 
described it, has no authority to make decisions. 
  [Al-Akwa'] 'Abdallah al-Asnaj has no justification to say 
such things. What is the authorization needed to make 
decisions? When a certain party sends an envoy on a particular 
mission, this means it gives him powers equal to his mission. 
  [Riyad] 'Abdallah al-Asnaj has remarked that Aden's 
delegation has the power to make decisions pertaining to a 
cease-fire. 
  [Al-Akwa'] I wish to say this: He represents a rebellious 
party and can claim to have power. In actual fact, they always 
avoid reaching a solution. Formerly when we and they held a 
political dialogue, I was a member of the political dialogue 
committee. Whenever we came close to a solution, they provoked 
disputes and introduced new debates to lead us into an endless 
maze that would prevent a solution. 
  [Riyad] Why does the fighting continue so fiercely despite 
the two sides having accepted the idea of dialogue and the UN 
Security Council resolution which provides for a cease-fire. 
Sanaa bears the blame for continuing the war, or at least 
everyone is saying that it is to blame. 
  [Al-'Akwa'] This is a very simple matter. A permanent 
cease-fire aims to encourage the international community to 
intervene and disengage the two warring sides. This is the 
rebels' objective. From the beginning the rebels sought not to 
solve the crisis or observe a cease-fire in a normal way. They 
were afraid that if this happened, the citizens would think more 
about the situation and distance themselves from the rebels' 
goal, namely seceding by force. Their aim is to continue the 
fighting and to provoke an international response. They went so 
far as to attack civilian targets inside Aden in order to claim 
that the legitimate forces had carried out those attacks. They 
did this to justify intervention by international troops to 
disengage the warring parties. They wanted to guarantee their 
secession. 
  [Riyad] Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has stated that Egypt 
stresses the need for observing an immediate cease-fire because 
continuing the fighting would devour all chances of safeguarding 
unity. Under the current circumstances, how do you view the 
future of this unity? 
  [Al-Akwa'] Truly, all the Yemeni people support unity. When 
we say they are rebels we do not say it just for the sake of 
making accusations. They claim that they want to secede the 
south. But they do not represent the south or the wishes of the 
people of the south. They fail to understand the geographical 
reality of the south. They are now deployed in extremely small 
areas. Let's take for example the southern governorates. Lahij 
is currently under the control of legitimacy; Abyan is also 
under the control of legitimacy; parts of Shabwah, Aden, and 
Hadhramaut are under the control of legitimacy. They are 
deployed in a very small area. They have no popular support. 
They rely on party forces. They rely on individuals who have 
received party education. This is evident in the support that 
the citizens in the southern and eastern governorates give to 
the legitimate forces. 
  The rebels' forces have been expelled not only by the 
legitimate army but also by the citizens in those areas, whether 
in Abyan, Shabwah, Hadhramaut, or Lahij. The security and 
administrative affairs in the areas that were regained by the 
legitimate forces are being supervised by their sons and not by 
the legitimate forces. 
  This is obvious and any person can verify this on the 
ground. 
We do not consider our brothers in Egypt as a foreign party. 
We believe that we have common blood with our brothers in 
Egypt. Yemeni and Egyptian blood was shed and it watered the 
Yemeni land to achieve and establish the Yemeni revolution. The 
revolution's principal objective was to achieve the Yemeni unity. 
  [Riyad] What is the next step now that UN Envoy Lakhdar 
Brahimi has failed in his mission? 
  [Al-Akwa'] I do not believe that he has failed. 
  [Riyad] But he failed to bring the two sides together, or to 
achieve a unified formula of a mechanism for halting the 
fighting. 
  [Al-Akwa'] I am definite that Lakhdar Brahimi has not yet 
announced that he has failed. It was the rebels' 
representatives who said that Brahimi has failed. This is 
because they had built their calculations on this basis -- that 
Brahimi would fail in his mission. They made the announcement 
before Brahimi said anything. Brahimi has not failed, but they 
tried to place obstacles to undermine his mission by insisting 
that they represent an independent state. If we were prepared 
to accept them as an independent state, there would have never 
been a problem or a war. But the problem cropped up when they 
tried to impose secession and set up an independent state by 
force. It was the responsibility of the government and the 
legitimate forces to defend unity. They started to use force to 
impose secession. 
  [Riyad] Does this mean that the dialogue will continue and 
that there is hope that an agreement will be reached? 
  [Al-Akwa'] We are interested working out an actual mechanism 
for a cease-fire. We believe that every day that passes means 
more blood will be shed and more people will be killed. This 
will only complicate the issue. Every day that passes means 
more efforts will be needed to resolve the problem. Therefore, 
we are very interested in working out a mechanism that could 
achieve a cease-fire immediately. 
  [Riyad] Thank you. 
  [Al-Akwa'] You are welcome.

<F P=106> [Report by Salih Qallab: "Reports of Disagreements Among </F>
Northern Leaders. Hard-Liners Insist on Fighting to the End"] 
  [Text] Amman -- A senior Yemeni official has said over the 
telephone from Sanaa that a sharp disagreement has erupted among 
senior northern leaders over the mission of the UN secretary 
general's envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, and the proposal he submitted 
two days ago to hold a meeting in Cairo between Sanaa and Aden 
delegations. 
  The official said that the disagreement necessitated holding 
an emergency meeting under Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih. It was attended by Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, 
speaker of the House of Representatives, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid 
al-Zindani, and 'Abdallah al-Anisi, representing the Yemeni 
Reform Grouping [YRG]; and by Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, Dr. 
Muhammad Sa'id al-'Attar, and Colonel 'Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar, 
representing the General People's Congress [GPC]. 
  The official said that a severe disagreement dominated the 
meeting, and that Dr. al-Iryani was the first speaker, maybe in 
coordination with President 'Ali Salih. And that he -- that is, 
al-Iryani -- stressed that Sanaa has tried everything to resolve 
the situation, and it is impossible for things to continue in 
this manner forever. 
  According to the Yemeni official, al-Iryani stressed that 
his 
country has become isolated and has lost the support of 
neighboring states and numerous Arab states. And that it has 
been placed in the category of Iraq and Iraqi President Saddam 
Husayn -- which will lead it into an unenviable situation. 
  Al-Iryani proposed that President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
personally make an Arab tour to include neighboring states, 
Egypt, and some other states in order to break what he termed 
the political siege imposed on Sanaa. He also proposed that 
southern [as published] deputies make an Arab tour to explain 
the northern Yemeni capital's view of the ongoing war. 
  The Yemeni official stressed that the YRG leaders -- Shaykh 
al-Ahmar, 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Anisi, and Dr. al-Zindani, supported 
by Col. Muhsin al-Ahmar -- rejected the idea of sending a 
delegation to Cairo and insisted on continuing the fighting and 
not responding to the UN mediation. They said that Aden is now 
in their grasp and that any cease-fire is going to make them 
lose the military battle after having lost the political battle. 
  The official pointed out that President Salih is in an 
unenviable mental situation. That he has made great efforts to 
persuade senior members of his leadership to send a northern 
delegation to Cairo. And that he threatened to boycott the 
meeting before the participants agreed to his proposal in this 
connection. 
  The Yemeni official noted that the delegation Sanaa sent to 
Cairo has a partisan and not an official capacity -- which means 
that the northern leadership insists that the dialogue with the 
southerners must remain within the framework that existed before 
the eruption of the fighting, as discussions were conducted 
between the GPC and the YRG on the one hand and the Yemeni 
Socialist Party on the other.

<F P=106> [Reports by Raghidah Dirgham in New York, Sulayman Nimr in </F>
Sanaa, Iqbal 'Ali 'Abdallah in Aden, and 'Abdallah al-Hajj in 
Jeddah: "U.S. Pressure To Prevent Storming of Aden"] 
  [Excerpts] Northern military pressure on Aden continued 
yesterday. The city was the target of heavy shelling. [passage 
omitted] 
  AL-HAYAH learned yesterday that Washington was exerting 
pressure to prevent the storming of Aden but it also preferred, 
at least for the time being and in order to facilitate political 
solutions, not to impose political isolation on the north. 
  Meanwhile, circles of former President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad 
yesterday broke their silence and reaffirmed his refusal to 
assume any leadership responsibilities in Yemen while the 
infighting and secessionist activity continued. They also 
emphasized that 'Ali Nasir Muhammad's supporters had nothing to 
do with the current conflict. They added that he urged all 
parties to stop shelling Aden. [passage omitted] 
  AL-HAYAH has learned from Arab sources in contact with the 
U.S. Administration that Washington was beginning to "lose its 
patience" with Sanaa because of its continued bombardment of 
Aden. They said that Washington "opposes the storming of Aden 
and at the same time advises the other side and the states of 
the region to be patient and to play a calming role." 
  The sources also said that, while Washington was firm about 
the need to control Sanaa and prevent it exploiting [UN 
Secretary General special envoy] Brahimi's mission to complete 
its military resolution of the situation, it was advising the 
regional states concerned to delay playing the "secession 
recognition" card in order to avoid the hardening of positions 
and military escalation, and "urging that Sanaa should not be 
isolated at this stage." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Statment issued by "an official source"; place and date not </F>
given] 
  [Text] The Republic of Yemen has followed, with concern, 
the statement made by the official spokeswoman of the U.S. State 
Department in Wahington last night. In the statement she spoke 
about assertions received by the U.S. Administration from the 
Government of the Republic of Yemen that the Armed Forces will 
not enter into the city of Aden. 
  The Government of the Republic of Yemen would like to affirm 
that it previously informed the Governments of the United States 
and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia that the Government of the 
Republic of Yemen will delay the entry of the Armed Forces, the 
forces of unity and legitimacy, into Aden to chase the remnants 
of rebellious secessions, who are using the civilian citizens as 
human shields, if it finds an appropriate political solution 
based on ending the rebellion, holding dialogue within the 
framework of the Republic of Yemen, on adhering to its 
Constitution and constitutional legitimacy resulting from the 
elections of 27 April 1993, and on stopping interference in 
internal Yemeni affairs to end the war and stop Yemeni bloodshed. 
  The Government of the Republic of Yemen would like to remind 
all that the continuation of the present situation, the 
continuation of secession and violation of constitutional 
legitimacy, and the continuation of arms and military hardware 
supplies to secessionists to prolong the conflict call on the 
Government of the Republic of Yemen to shoulder its national and 
constitutional responsibility to end the secession. It finds 
itself forced -- in accordance with its constitutional and legal 
right -- to deal with the violators of constitutional legitimacy 
in the appropriate way and in any part of the Yemeni territory. 
  The Government of the Republic of Yemen hopes that brothers 
and friends will understand this.

<F P=106> [Reports by Raghidah Dirgham in New York, Faysal Makram in </F>
Sanaa, Iqbal 'Abdallah in Aden, and Ashraf al-Faqiyy in Cairo: 
"Sanaa: The United States Is Interfering in Our Internal 
Affairs"] 
  [Excerpts] The meeting scheduled to take place in Cairo 
today between the parties to the Yemeni conflict is facing 
difficulties because of the fundamental differences between 
these parties. [passage omitted] 
  In another important development, Sanaa yesterday denied 
promising the United States not to storm Aden. A General 
People's Congress [GPC] senior official went so far as to say 
that the statement issued by the U.S. State Department "is a 
flagrant and rejected interference in the internal affairs of 
the Yemeni Republic." 
  In New York, it has been learned that the government of the 
Yemen Arab Republic conveyed to Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN 
secretary general's envoy, its position on the Cairo meeting 
between delegations from Sanaa and Aden to discuss a mechanism 
for the supervision of the cease-fire, emphasizing that the 
meeting should take the form of indirect talks, not face to 
face, should be based on the existing government coalition, and 
should not constitute any form of recognition or dealing with 
the secessionists. [passage omitted] 
  In Sanaa, in the first reaction to the U.S. State 
Department's recent statement, the Yemeni Government denied 
promising the U.S. Administration that the government's armed 
forces would not enter Aden. A responsible sources said that 
"the Yemeni Government had informed the U.S. and Saudi 
Governments that it would postpone the entry of the forces of 
legitimacy and unity into Aden in pursuit of the remnants of the 
rebel secessionists if the government found a suitable political 
solution based on ending the mutiny and holding a dialogue 
within the framework of the Yemeni Republic with commitment to 
the Constitution and the constitutional legitimacy resulting 
from 27 April 1993, as well as noninterference in Yemen's 
internal affairs, to end the war and spare blood." [passage 
omitted] 
  'Abd-al-Salam al-'Ansi, head of the General Department and 
member of the General Committee of the General People's Congress 
[GPC], has stated that the U.S. State Department's statement 
came as a surprise and was illogical and the GPC saw it as 
flagrant interference in Yemen's internal affairs. 
  In a statement to AL-HAYAH in Sanaa yesterday, he said that 
the GPC totally rejects the U.S. State Department's statement 
and sees it as a flagrant and rejected interference in the 
internal affairs of the Yemen Arab Republic, because the current 
war in Yemen is a war between the legitimate and constitutional 
government forces and a band of secessionists from some 
leaderships of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]. What the 
legitmate forces are doing comes under the constitutional rights 
of the Yemeni Republic's Government." [quotation marks as 
published] 
  In conclusion, al-'Ansi said: "The Yemeni Government and the 
legitimate forces care more about Aden, its population, and its 
installations than the U.S. Administration or anyone else, and 
the government forces' entry into Aden does not depend on an 
U.S. or non-U.S. permit. It is rather a question of the 
government's concern for the lives, properties, and human rights 
of the innocent population, and of preserving economic and 
public establishments in the city. When the time comes for the 
legitimate forces to enter the city in pursuit of the 
secessionist remnants, there would be nothing to prevent them 
from entering the city any time the military and political 
commands decide that the lives of the citizens are safe from any 
danger."

<F P=106> [Interview with 'Abdallah al-Asnaj, "foreign minister of the </F>
Democratic Republic of Yemen", by Salah Salamah on 20 June; 
place not given; from the "Today's Guest" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Salamah] Mr. 'Abdallah al-Asnaj, foreign minister 
of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, which was unilaterally 
declared almost one month ago. You are welcome to Radio Monte 
Carlo. 
  [Al-Asnaj] You are welcome. 
  [Salamah] Arab and international efforts to settle the 
dispute have failed. Battles are continuing. Aden is besieged 
and is being exposed to daily shelling. What is the current 
military balance of forces in the battles between the northern 
and southern units? 
  [Al-Asnaj] As you have said, battles are continuing. The 
siege on the Yemeni citizens in the Aden Governorate reached its 
peak when water and electricity supplies were cut and when 
hospitals and public utilities were destroyed by the invading 
northern military units. 
  [Salamah] Lakhdar Brahimi, the international mediator in the 
Yemeni dispute, failed yesterday and today to hold a meeting of 
the northern and southern delegations present in Cairo, with the 
aim of agreeing on a mechanism to monitor the cease-fire 
preparatory to sitting at the negotiating table. What are the 
reasons for this failure 
  [Al-Asnaj] Lakhdar Brahimi has not succeeded in holding a 
meeting between the northern and southern sides at the 
negotiating table, or at least in getting acquainted with the 
viewpoint of the northern side in a precise way, because the 
northern side has not assigned a delegation on a level 
authorized to make a serious decision, such as cease-fire, or to 
agree on a mechanism to monitor a firm cease-fire. 
  [Salamah] Mr. 'Abdallah al-Asnaj: Sanaa sources today 
affirmed that the northern delegation had all powers to hold a 
dialogue, provided this is done within the framework of the 
ruling coalition, the Republic of Yemen, and constitutional 
legitimacy. These sources said you refused to meet with the 
northern delegation. Does this mean that you shoulder a moral 
responsibility for the failure? 
  [Al-Asnaj] This is another falsehood on the part of Sanaa. 
First, the delegation that came to Cairo represented the General 
People's Congress [GPC] and the Yemeni Reform Grouping [YRG]. 
The delegation did not represent the central authority in Sanaa. 
The members of the delegation are known to everyone; they are 
incapable of forcing 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, the small dictator of 
Sanaa, to adopt a stand of which he himself is not convinced, or 
to make a cease-fire decision and abide by it. 
  So, the delegation did not have authority, was not on the 
required level, and its members were known. I do not have to 
reiterate this. The delegation includes a southern GPC member, 
who is on the payroll of 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, and brother 
'Abd-al-Qadir (?al-Qayri), secretary of Shaykh 'Abdallah 
Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar [speaker of the House of Representatives], 
from the YRG. These have no capacity on the level of the 
central authority, which is loyal to 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. So, 
the southern side bears no responsibility whatsoever because it 
sent a delegation on the highest level with absolute 
authorization. We communicated this in writing to Lakhdar 
Brahimi, namely, that this delegation has all powers to swiftly 
set an urgent date for cease-fire and to abide by this date. 
  I hope the picture will be clear. Sanaa is the party making 
accusations and the one which makes promises and does not keep 
them. 
  [Salamah] Therefore, you adhere to the demand of negotiating 
with a delegation that has the authority to decide? 
  [Al-Asnaj] Most definitely. We are a delegation that has the 
right to decide the fate of a people who adhere to this right, 
which is guaranteed by the UN Charter. 
  [Salamah] Recently, President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih showed 
noticeable flexibility over terms to resume dialogue with the 
southern Leaders. However, the southern leaders insisted on 
entering the dialogue, as you has said, in the form of an 
independent government. According to Sanaa, this led to the 
failure of the Cairo meeting. Are you insisting on going ahead 
in your secession from Sanaa and on adhering to the formula of 
the unilaterally declared Democratic Republic of Yemen? 
  [Al-Asnaj] The world has never seen a president waging a war 
against his own people, destroying their installations and 
public utilities, ruining houses, and reiterating his insistence 
on invading a people in a besieged governorate. What kind of 
legitimacy is left for this ruler who declares war against his 
own people? The fact that this war was declared, that it is 
continuing, and the fact that the cease-fire demands are 
rejected cancel what remains of the legitimacy claimed by the 
northern side. Moreover, the southern side has the right to 
self-determination. It was a state four years ago. It 
voluntarily renounced its independent and regional identity and 
is now trying to regain it. This is nothing new. 
  [Salamah] Today, Salim Salih Muhammad, a member of the 
southern Presidential Council, demanded quick Arab and 
international recognition of the declared Democratic Republic of 
Yemen. With the exception of Qatar, the Gulf Cooperation 
Council states have tacitly recognized this republic. Are you 
going to insist on this move? Do you expect quick Arab and 
international recognition? 
  [Al-Asnaj] Having declared his indiscriminate and all-out 
war 
against our brothers in the south, there is no place for central 
authority or a unity that was basically destroyed by Sanaa. 
Unity is mutual acceptance, a covenant of cooperation, a joint 
responsibility. It is not hegemony, control, tyranny, and the 
usurpation of the right of the southern part to have an opinion 
and a role in drawing up the future of the homeland. 
  Sanaa's authority has violated everything that it was hoped 
it would abide by, in terms of the unity agreement, and it 
unilaterally canceled the pledge and accord agreement reached in 
the Jordanian capital. It dismissed ministers and ambassadors 
and took feverish measures that no law or constitution would 
accept. 
  Sanaa voluntarily renounced its responsibility and its 
legitimacy. Sanaa has stripped itself of its legitimacy in the 
same way that it stripped Aden of it. Each side in the north 
and south now has an absolute right to choose the most 
appropriate way to preserve its rights and develop its society. 
In the future, there will be fields of cooperation, as they 
were in the past. 
  [Salamah] You demand the deployment of international 
observers to supervise the cease-fire. The northern leaders 
demand the revival of the joint military committee formed last 
December. Do you believe it is impossible to find an acceptable 
compromise between these two proposals, to stop the shooting and 
begin talking? 
  [Al-Asnaj] Had there been enough credibility and sincere 
intentions to cease fire or to stop the current war in Yemen and 
abide by a definite date for enforcing the cease-fire, an 
appropriate mechanism would be possible and ready at hand. I 
would like to say that the previous military committee was 
formed by a decision from 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih to contain and 
solve problems in Yemeni military camps housing joint forces. 
War had not broken out by then. Now the war has expanded and a 
military committee of the size in which it was formed at that 
time cannot monitor an agreed cease-fire violation on a large 
terrain covering almost all Yemeni territory. 
  [Salamah] In view of the continuing battles and the failure 
of Arab and international mediation, the Yemeni crisis has 
reached an impasse. Do you believe it is possible to reach a 
solution enabling the Yemeni people to stop the war and return 
to peace and security? 
  [Al-Asnaj] The Yemeni people want peace. They want to reach 
a quick end to this war. They are fed up with the calamities of 
this war that was imposed on them. However, the decision is up 
to those who call for the continuation of the war. It is up to 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his allies from the political Islamists 
in the reform party. I believe further Arab and international 
pressures will convince the little dictator in Sanaa that the 
international community rejects all the massacres he is carrying 
out against the Yemeni people in the south. 
  [Salamah] Observers believe the military balance of forces 
is 
tipped in favor of the northern units. Minister 'Abd-al-Karim 
al- Iryani said today that if a negotiated solution is not 
reached, there will be a determination to resort to a military 
solution and to occupy Aden and al-Mukalla. Do you in the south 
have the ability to remain steadfast and continue in the 
fighting, given the lopsided balance of forces? 
  [Al-Asnaj] I do not know if brother 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani 
is qualified to be a general and to ascertain the ability of the 
armed forces to reach their aims in the vast areas in Hadhramaut 
and to penetrate the steadfastness of Aden. Aden will remain 
steadfast and the north -- we greatly regret to say this because 
the victims and the killers are children of Yemen -- will pay a 
very high price and will not be able to have its own way if they 
penetrate the city of Aden. As for Hadhramaut, the results of 
the battles so far indicate that the southern forces repulsed 
all the northern forces attacks and scattered their 
concentrations in this vast desert, and that our northern 
brother soldiers wish that they had remained in Sanhan, Anif, 
and Hamdan, instead of being pushed by the little dictator of 
Sanaa into a fight in which they have no interest at all.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Salim Salih Tells AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: </F>
Sanaa Has Two Days To Stop Fighting; Otherwise, We Will Demand 
Announcement of Recognition of South"] 
  [Text] Cairo, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- In a statement to 
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT Salim Salih, member of the Yemeni Presidential 
Council, has given Sanaa two days to announce and comply with a 
cease-fire, otherwise Aden will be entitled to demand that the 
Security Council impose sanctions on Sanaa and announce world 
states' recognition of the Democratic Republic of Yemen. 
  He said: For our part, we are ready for anything when a 
cease-fire is announced first, then we can discuss the mechanism 
of halting the fighting. 
  He said: The task of the joint southern-northern committee 
meeting in Cairo is just to discuss the formation of the 
military committee or team to be assigned to monitor the 
cease-fire. And there is no major disagreement between us and 
Sanaa with regard to accepting [the participation of] Arab and 
Islamic states and Security Council member states, but the 
committee will be under UN supervision. 
  Salim pointed to Sanaa's defiance of the international 
community and the Arab community by escalating the political and 
military situations and by constantly shelling Aden -- which 
proves it has no desire to halt the fighting. He said: I want 
[UN secretary general's envoy] Brahimi's mission to succeed and 
the Security Council resolutions to be complied with. We are 
exerting every effort to halt the fighting. 
  He reemphasized Aden's steadfastness despite the cutting off 
of water and electricity. All that Sanaa is saying about its 
occupation of Aden is an attempt to play for time and give 
public opinion the impression that the rebels have surrendered 
and the war is over. 
  He said: The issue of abolishing the state of the Democratic 
Republic of Yemen is now in the hands of the Yemeni people, and 
it is they who have to decide on it. And the people are 
currently fighting the occupation and the bombardment of 
villages and cities.

'Abd-al-Majid has again called on the Yemeni parties to 
cooperate with Arab and UN efforts to establish a cease-fire and

<F P=106> [By Maher Chmaytelli] </F>
  [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 21 (AFP) -- Besieging northern 
forces showered Aden's suburbs with katyusha rockets in a 
night-time bombardment which killed at least two civilians and 
wounded 17, hospital officials said Tuesday [21 June]. 
  Several rockets slammed into the Al-Qahirah and al-Mansurah 
areas in the north of the city and another six hit nearby 
hillsides, said injured civilians at Al-Jumhuriyah hospital. 
  The northern and southern forces were also trading artillery 
fire along the war fronts some 20 kilometres (12 miles) from 
Aden, while shells hit the city airport throwing up clouds of 
dust and sand. 
  Hospital officials said almost 90 people have been killed 
since northern forces loyal to President 'Ali Abdallah Salih 
began a systematic bombardment of this southern bastion on 
Thursday. 
  Terrified townspeople have said they are praying for their 
lives, as there are few places in bomb shelters for the city's 
500,000 inhabitants. 
  Southern leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid broadcast an appeal on 
television late Monday for the United Nations, the Arab League 
and the rest of the international community to "stop the savage 
bombardments on Aden and its vital installations, which have 
killed and wounded hundreds". 
  He also asked Arab and friendly countries to recognise the 
breakaway Yemen Democratic Republic (YDR), declared by the south 
on May 21 but not yet recognised by any country. 
  Al-Bid's appeal followed the failure of UN special envoy 
Lakhdar Brahimi to broker a ceasefire in the war. Brahimi left 
Cairo on Monday after the collapse of talks with northern and 
southern delegations there on Sunday. 
  Al-Bid pleaded for a "total (northern) retreat from the 
international frontiers of the YDR and demanded "damages from 
the Sanaa regime for destruction caused by its aggression". 
  He also asked for direct international food and medical aid 
for people living in parts of south Yemen occupied by northern 
troops. 
  The southern chief, who is based in the eastern port of 
al-Mukalla, also published a decree on Tuesday announcing 
compensation for families of the victims. 
  Relatives of those killed would receive 50,000 riyals while 
wounded would be given 25,000. A dollar is officially worth 12 
riyals, but trades on the black market at almost 80 riyals. 
  War broke out between northern and southern forces on May 5 
after four years of troubled union between the former North and 
South Yemens.

  [Text] Last night, the fire at the Mocha power station fuel 
tanks was brought under control. The power station was the 
target of a treacherous, cowardly raid by the treasonous, agent 
secessionist gang's aircraft. Fire and security men exerted 
great and continuous efforts for 26 hours with unparalleled zeal 
and vigor to save this important, vital installation, which was 
built with the blood and sweat of our militant Yemeni people. A 
vile clique from the secessionist, apostate gang is trying to 
destroy such installations, in keeping with its ignoble habit of 
sowing death and destroying economic and vital installations. 
  The brother Ta'izz governor directly supervised the progress 
of rescuing and evacuating the dead and wounded workers, 
children, and women to hospitals. The brother governor also 
directly supervised the fire fighting process until the fire was 
brought under control, with the support of God and the efforts 
of the efficient fire and security men.

  [Text] Abu Dhabi, 21 Jun (MENA) -- Citing high-ranking 
Turkish sources, AL-ITTIHAD newspaper today states that weapons 
have been shipped to north Yemen from Romania since early June. 
Giant Russian Ilyushin 76 cargo planes carry the weapons via 
(?Utabani) airport in Bucharest and cross Turkish airspace twice 
a day, going to Yemen at night and returning empty the next day. 
  According to the sources, the Romanian flights had obtained 
permission to transport vegetables across Turkish airspace. 
This has been verified through technological methods by air 
control units. 
  Since no ban has been imposed on weapons shipments to Yemen, 
Turkey cannot take any measures to interrupt these flights, the 
sources said. 
  In another development, AL-ITTIHAD has learned from sources 
in Cairo that one of the formulas put forward during the meeting 
in Cairo between the UN secretary general's envoy Lakhdar 
Brahimi and a north Yemeni delegation was to set up an Arab and 
Islamic force to supervise the cease-fire under UN auspices. 
The north Yemeni delegation did not respond to the proposal, 
requesting to refer it to the government, while the chairman of 
the southern delegation welcomed it. 
  The paper adds that Brahimi promised to provide UN funds for 
these troops to give them international status and make the 
proposal acceptable to all parties concerned.

<F P=106> [Report by Terence White] </F>
  [Text] Kabul, June 21 (AFP) -- Kabul peace talks between 
rival faction leaders President Borhanoddin Rabbani and Prime 
Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar have stalled for the second 
successive day over the issue of ex-communists, official sources 
said Tuesday [21 June]. 
  Delegations from the two sides were supposed to meet early 
Tuesday at the west Kabul headquarters of the Shiite Hezb-e 
Wahdat faction, but a spokesman there told AFP Hekmatyar had 
insisted on the attendance of representatives of his 
ex-communist ally, Uzbek General 'Abdol Rashid Dostam. 
  "Rabbani's people refuse to sit down with any one from 
Dostam," said the Wahdat official. Dostam was allied to Rabbani 
until January this year, when he launched a failed coup attempt 
against the president, supported by Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami 
faction. Inconclusive fighting has raged in Kabul for nearly 
six months since. 
  Jalil Shams, the deputy foreign minister and special peace 
mediator, went Tuesday to Hekmatyars's Chahar Asiab headquarters 
outside Kabul to try and persuade the prime minister to change 
his stance over Dostam, the Wahdat official said. But, the 
Wahdat official said that to ignore the Junbish party of Dostam 
was "to kill any chance for a successful solution" to the 
problems in Afghanistan. "Junbish is a real power in 
Afghanistan and must be included in peace talks," he said. 
  The hoped-for Kabul talks between Rabbani and Hekmatyar are 
described as a "preliminary" session to a larger conference 
proposed by Sham's peace mission in the western provincial 
capital Herat, to which all faction leaders -- except Dostam -- 
have been invited. The idea of the Herat conference is to set 
up an interim government to run the country after the end of 
June, when Hekmatyar and others expect Rabbani's presidency to 
end. But Rabbani's followers steadfastly refuse to admit that 
the president must resign at the end of June. 
  At the Intercontinental Hotel Tuesday Rabbani attended a 
special conference of supporters who insisted the president only 
hand over power to a national assembly or Loya Jirga. 
  "We demand the president remain in power until the convening 
of a grand national assembly," declared Ahmad Hashmi, chief of 
the Islamic Brotherhood and Reconciliation Front. "Only by this 
way can we avoid a power vacuum," Hashmi said. 
  "Leaving the country without a president, even for one day, 
is total madness," said another speaker. 
  Rabbani himself, in a half-hour speech, ignored the subject 
of his resignation but declared his support for the Herat talks 
on the condition that all factions were represented. 
  However, the president stressed that the faction leaders 
should not monopolise power but allow the Afghan people to 
decide their future -- presumably a call for an immediate 
national assembly without a preliminary interim government as 
proposed by the Herat peace commission.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri by </F>
Rashid Khashanah in Tunis; date not given] 
  [Text] [Khashanah] With the completion of the formation 
of the Transitional National Council [TNC], is it to be hoped 
that the democratic process will be revived? 
  [Dembri] We have undertaken to implement the resolutions of 
last January's national conference. We have indeed concentrated 
on the transitional institutions. The political dialogue is 
still in progress with an open mind and with all parties 
including those who have so far refused to participate (in the 
institutions). We are very hopeful that the circle of accord 
will be enlarged in the coming months. 
  I should remind you here that the election process has been 
programmed for three years from now, but we would revive it even 
earlier if the circumstances allowed that. 
  [Khashanah] There is an urgent U.S. call for dialogue with 
the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] and for giving it a share in 
government. What do you say to that? 
  [Dembri] We say that Algeria needs all its sons without 
exception. When we declare that we are for an open dialogue, 
that means that we do not exclude any political group or 
political figure if they accept the fundamental conditions, 
especially the republican regime, respect for the opposite 
opinion, partisan plurality, respect for the Algerian people's 
components and sanctities, and renunciation of violence as a 
means of gaining power or remaining in power. I believe that 
these conditions should be accepted by those who enter into a 
dialogue with us. 
  [Khashanah] The gap between the U.S. and French positions is 
now common knowledge. How do you in Algeria view the two 
positions, especially the U.S. call for FIS participation in the 
government? 
  [Dembri] We are now in a transitional stage paving the way 
for the resumption of the election process. After that it will 
be the people who will freely decide who is to the represent 
them in the future. The government's role is to organize this 
transitional period. 
  As regards the dialogue, it is an open dialogue and it 
covers 
the horizons of the new Algerian society based on the rule of 
law, politial plurality, and respect for the components of the 
Algerian character. That is important because we in Algeria are 
Muslim Arabs. These are basic facts which nobody has a right to 
(claim to) monopolize in the political arena, because they apply 
to all the Algerians. 
  It seems to me that there are numerous ways of loving 
Algeria 
but there is only one Algeria which should be united and uniting. 
  [Khashanah] Should we expect an early release of FIS leaders 
as a step to build trust and pave the way for national 
reconciliation? 
  [Dembri] In a democracy, everything is possible. 
  [Khashanah] In the government's view, what are the possible 
grounds for reconciliation? 
  [Dembri] There are the resolutions issued by the national 
conference. They have now been submitted to the [TNC].... 
  [Khashanah] But some major forces such as the Liberation 
Front [FLN], the Socialist Forces Front [SFF], and the FIS have 
boycotted the conference, so how could the latter's resolutions 
form common grounds? 
  [Dembri] The political forces you have mentioned did not 
reject the national conference resolutions, they wanted to add 
more points. How could they reject a republican regime, for 
instance? Nobody rejects that. And how could they object to 
political plurality, respect for the opposite opinion, and the 
rule of law? 
  [Khashanah] The government recently announced that it had 
destroyed Saeed Mekhlouf's group and dealt a blow to the 
fundamentalist groups. Does this mean that the regular forces 
have regained the initiative? 
  [Dembri] I am not acquainted with the security situation. 
  [Khashanah] How do you interpret the emphatic U.S. call for 
a dialogue with FIS and the emphatic French rejection of such a 
dialogue? 
  [Dembri] There are differences of opinion but we Algerians 
see ourselves as an Islamic Arab society and at the same time we 
adopt all the rules of the modern political game including 
respect for the law, individual and collective freedoms, and 
human rights. 
  Algerian society should now discuss everything that would 
contribute to its renaissance and chart its future dimensions. 
We do not need a classification of the Algerian society that is 
done abroad. I believe that Algerian political groups are 
intelligent enough and able enough to discuss their own affairs 
without foreign interference. 
  [Khashanah] Do you not believe that the economic agreements, 
especially the agreement with the "Paris Club" to reschedule 
public debts, would help reduce the deficit and calm the 
internal situation? 
  [Dembri] After our agreement with the IMF and the recent 
agreement with the Paris Club and the rescheduling of debts, we 
initiated separate bilateral negotiations with each donor state. 
The problem we Algerians are facing in this connection is 
whether our handling of this file should be political or 
strictly technical. The volume of [trade] exchanges between 
Algeria and the industrial states confirms clearly that there is 
an imbalance there and we have been losing since independence 
and to this day. 
  Between the years 1969 and 1989, that is in 20 years, 
Algeria 
got from the Western world $1.5 billion net but we paid the 
Western states in the same period $2.5-3 billion annually, or 
$50 to $60 billion over 20 years. So we ask: Which side 
contributed to the other's development, Algeria or the 
industrial states? I believe that the third world contributed 
to the development of the Western countries. 
  [Khashanah] The Moroccan press has been criticizing 
Algeria's position on the Sahara. Has there been any change in 
the Algerian Government's handling of that file? 
  [Dembri] There is a peace plan drawn up by the United 
Nations for the settlement of the Sahara problem. It has been 
decided to hold a free and impartial self-determination 
referendum as soon as possible. The UN peace plan is actually 
derived from the OAU's plan. 
  We should now tackle the issues which precede the referendum 
and pave the way for its success such as the terms for the 
definition of identity, the number of voters, the provision of 
guarantees after the referendum, and the way of organizing the 
election campaign. There are many issues on which understanding 
is expected to be reached in direct talks between Morocco and 
the Polisario, the two parties to the conflict. Algeria's 
position is one favoring success of that plan but if, during the 
talks, a possibility emerged of an agreed political solution 
between the two parties to the conflict, then that would be up 
to them before anyone else. That would then require political 
intelligence from all parties. 
  [Khashanah] Will Algerian-Moroccan relations improve after 
the coolness that has recently characterized them? 
  [Dembri] We do not judge relations by press campaigns which 
have no solid basis. Morocco is dear to us. Morocco, Algeria, 
Tunisia, Libya, and Mauritania have a role to play to strengthen 
our presence in this world. That is the main aim. The rest is 
secondary. 
  There is much room for fruitful cooperation and integration 
between us. Algeria is working on building a pipeline that 
crosses Moroccan territory. Morocco will get a share equal to 
30 percent of the gas carried through it to Europe. That proves 
Algeria's goodwill. 
  [Khashanah] What is Algeria doing to reactivate the Arab 
Maghreb Union [AMU], having assumed its chairmanship? 
  [Dembri] There is an extensive plan of action. Everyone 
appears to want to launch the Maghreb train. We have seen over 
the past years that the political will is ahead of the 
bureaucratic executive organs. If we review the results of the 
six summit conferences since the formation of the AMU, we would 
find that the leaders approved 30 agreements but only five of 
these agreements have entered the phase of implementation. That 
does not indicate a rejection of the march toward integration 
but it does indicate the existence of a gap and the reason for 
it is that the political will is ahead of bureaucratic practice, 
and that must be remedied. 
  [Khashanah] President Zeroual recently sent envoys to the 
Gulf states. Their arrival there coincided with the escalation 
of the war in Yemen. What did the envoys carry? 
  [Dembri] We always have talks with the Arab brothers on 
matters of common interest. On Arab and Islamic causes, Algeria 
is always eager to be at the forefront of the states searching 
for solutions and expressing absolute solidarity with its 
brothers. 
  There is a tragedy in Yemen and it should be tackled in the 
appropriate manner, which is consultation and coordination with 
all parties. If the Arabs cannot put their own house in order, 
what is left for us in this world? 
  [Khashanah] There was talk earlier of an Algerian initiative 
on behalf of the AMU to stop the war in Yemen. Is that still on? 
  [Dembri] Yes, it is still on but we have asked the brothers 
in Yemen to stop the fighting before anything else. The Yemeni 
brothers could then find solutions with their intelligence and 
wisdom. 
  [Khashanah] What is Algeria's position regarding the 
declaration of the "Democratic Republic of Yemen"? 
  [Dembri] Yes, there was such a declaration but will it end 
the fighting and will the Yemeni people accept a continuation of 
the battles? We first of all call for a cease-fire to spare the 
Yemeni people's blood and then we can look for solutions. That 
is Algeria's position.

  [Text] Rescheduling Algeria's foreign debts will relieve 
the burden on the oil and gas sectors, particularly as Algeria 
has a plan under implementation. This is what Amar Mekhloufi, 
minister of industry and energy said in an interview with the 
London-based AL-HAYAT newspaper. 
  The minister announced that this plan would be carried out 
in 
the next five years and was estimated to cost about $17 billion, 
50 percent of which would be in foreign currency. 
  The minister added that the plan would have good production 
and export results and would enable Algeria to repay its debts 
in the future.

<F P=106> [Sermon by Minister of Religious Affairs Sassi Lamouri in </F>
Algiers on 20 June--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] I beseech God's refuge from the curses of the 
damned satan. In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. May God's prayers and peace be upon the noblest 
of prophets, his family, companions and followers until the day 
of judgement. 
  I would like to salute the whole Algerian people on the 
occasion of this blessed day, which falls at the beginning of 
the new Hegira year 1415. I wish that new Hegira year will be a 
generous year; a year of blessing, concord, unity, compassion 
between members of this great people. [passage omitted] 
  The prophet, may God's prayers and peace be upon him, showed 
so much compassion to people. And that is why the message of 
Islam is one of compassion. The proof of that is the fact that 
the holy Koran's suras, and there are 114 of them, all begin all 
with the phrase: In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. This is a good indication for all wise men that 
the essence of this religion is compassion between humans. All 
godly religions were meant for sowing the seeds of compassion 
and peace between people, however. 
  We are facing in Algeria the most difficult period in our 
history. We are facing a period that requires us to exert 
united efforts, forget about grudges and rancor, and extend 
hands to each other so as to bring about unity, close our ranks, 
and bolster fraternity which Islam has called for. [passage 
omitted] 
  I am speaking in my capacity as religious affairs' minister. 
I have a duty toward my religion and my dear homeland which 
will make me proud the day I see it enjoying security and 
stability. I will raise my head high the day I see my country 
enjoying unity and closed ranks. It is my duty as a man of 
religion and a minister for religious affairs to say the words 
of truth. [passage omitted] 
  The Algerian nation is going through one of the most 
difficult periods. The wise men in it must endeavor to do good 
and call the unjust people by their names because injustice is a 
sin. [passage omitted] 
  People, being misled from overseas and other places, come to 
kill families and slaughter children while the people and the 
nation are keeping silent. This is unacceptable from a 
religious point of view. It is unacceptable from a religious 
point view that families and children are slaughtered while the 
nation is keeping silent. This is injustice. This is injustice. 
[passage omitted] 
  Therefore, there is probably a deception in what we are 
witnessing in the country. There is deception in the name of 
religion. I am telling you that had the prophet been revived, 
he would have disclaimed these acts. [passage omitted] 
  Muhammad, may God's Peace be upon him, did not shed any 
blood 
nor did he kill anybody, on the contrary he was compassionate. 
[passage omitted] 
  This proves than Islam is a religion of compassion and a 
religion of brotherhood; therefore if there is any deception in 
the name of religion Islam is innocent of it. Even those who 
claim that they speak in the name of religion or in the name of 
democracy or any other slogan are mistaken. [passage omitted] 
  Wise men stand in closed ranks and put an end to bloodshed 
and put an end to this raging fire which might spread 
everywhere. [Passage omitted] 
  Therefore, the Islamic religion clears itself from killing 
and bloodshed. Islam brought with it compassion, brotherhood, 
love, unity, and closing ranks. This is Islam. This is Islam. 
  This [present situation] could merely be a passing cloud. 
But woe unto those who have betrayed their country. Woe unto 
people who have betrayed their country. Nothing will last 
forever. This is merely a summer cloud that will pass soon. 
  Thanks be to God the ship is nearly arriving safely at its 
destination. The ship is nearly at a safe harbor. Today's 
events will be a thing of the past. And one must say the truth 
in these very harsh circumstances because any nation which does 
not stand for the truth will have no history. And it is, 
therefore, the responsibility of the people as the prophet said: 
You are all responsible; everyone of you ought to shoulder the 
burden of its responsibilities. Hence, everyone of us ought to 
shoulder his responsibility. Those who have gone astray should 
return to the righteous path, accept to live with this society 
and lay down their arms. 
  To take up arms against the sons of your nation is a crime 
which will never be forgiven. Taking to arms is an unforgivable 
crime. Even if we punish those people in accordance with the 
shari'ah, the shari'ah has ruled: This is the recompense of 
those who fight against God and His messenger, and hasten about 
the earth, to do corruption there: They will be slaughtered, or 
crucified, or their hands and feet will alternately be struck 
off, or they will be banished from the land. That is a 
degradation for them in this world; and in the world to come 
awaits them a mighty chastisement. 
  This is [the punishment] for those who have taken to arms, 
broken with community, are harming the unity of the nation, and 
terrorize its members. 
  Do we have to make people cry every day? Do we have to 
terrorize families everyday? Do we have to make children, 
women, elderly, and poor people die with fear and terror? Why? 
Why all this? Is not there among you someone who is wise 
enough? 
  I am aware that there are people who can help to stop this 
bloodshed; but they have so far been very mean. However, it is 
their duty to make an effort and put the fire out. It is their 
duty to put the fire out. Algeria is for everyone. No one 
should be worried about the state of Islam in Algeria. Islam in 
Algeria is doing fine. [passage omitted] 
  I speak the truth and we should not be reluctant to assume 
our responsibilities. [passage omitted] The people are 
responsible and the Prophet holds you responsible. We are 
celebrating the religious festival of 'Ashura, and I wish that 
this day will make tomorrow the last day of misfortunes in 
Algeria's history. I say to those who have gone astray and have 
erred: Lay down your arms, lay down your arms and live in 
society a happy and good life. Islam prohibits this and 
prohibits killings. Let me say this for the record: Islam is 
against the shedding of blood. 
  I say this and I ask God's forgiveness for you and myself, 
for God is much-forgiving and compassionate. May God's peace 
and blessings be upon you.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: Informed U.S. circles have cast doubt 
on the possibility of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
making a new visit to the Middle East this week, attributing 
this to insufficient signs of progress in the regional peace 
process. 
  It is known that such signs should be shown by Israel. Syria 
has frequently proven its real desire to achieve peace. It has 
constantly worked for the success of the U.S. and the 
international efforts, as part of the Madrid conference and 
according to its established bases. 
  What has happened so far, however, conflicts with these 
bases. The just and comprehensive peace to which the U.S. 
administration committed itself has become separate partial 
deals. The Washington talks were stymied in favor of secret 
talks here and there. In addition, the Security Council 
resolutions, which are supposed to organize the peace process, 
were deliberately ignored. Israel continued to intensify the 
situation in southern Lebanese areas. It did not hide the fact 
that its escalating attacks are intended to terrorize Lebanon 
and pressure Syria. 
  Under these circumstances, observers naturally wonder about 
the promised U.S. role. Washington is supposed to be the first 
to defend its initiative and adhere to its commitments, and, 
consequently, halt the continued Israeli sabotage of the peace 
process, in accordance with the agreed bases. 
  Politicians and observers know it is impossible to achieve 
peace in the Middle East without Syria, and that the attempts to 
circumvent Syria and ignore its basic role in the region will 
lead the peace process to a real impasse. While it is in the 
interest of the Middle East to achieve a state of peace that 
gives it an opportunity to dedicate its resources to 
development, it is definitely in the interest of the United 
States that the aspired peace is firm and well-established, 
rather than a mere truce that cannot withstand events and 
developments. 
  A firm and well-established peace requires a minimum level 
of 
justice, fairness, and honesty. Syria has always made it clear 
that Israel's full withdrawal from the Golan, southern Lebanon, 
and the other occupied territories is an inevitable prelude to 
the establishment of peace. The Security Council resolutions 
actually stipulate that Israel should withdraw and that the 
Israeli measures of annexation, Judaization, and settlements are 
null and void. 
  The U.S. initiative itself provides for exchanging land for 
peace. Israel, however, has thus far refused to commit itself 
to full withdrawal from the occupied territories. It has only 
hinted at the possibility of a partial withdrawal from the 
Golan. It also announces daily that it has annexed Jerusalem 
once and for all, in addition to important parts of the West 
Bank, under the guise of a greater Jerusalem. To prove its 
rejection of the substance of the peace process, namely, 
returning the occupied territories, Israel shells southern 
Lebanon every day and threatens to escalate its acts of 
aggression. 
  Saving the peace process from deliberate Israeli sabotage is 
a U.S. and international responsibility. The United States has 
the clout it will take to implement the Security Council 
resolutions. Without doing so, peace in the Middle East will 
remain a deferred project. The only way to achieve peace is a 
daring and decisive international position that removes Israeli 
belligerence from the region's atmosphere.

<F P=106> [Press review] </F>
  [Text] Today's press commentaries address the clear and 
unambiguous Syrian position on the peace process, as well as 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's tour of the region. 
  In its commentary today, the newspaper AL-BA'TH asserts that 
Syria's clear and unambiguous position on the peace process can 
no longer be questioned. This is because it is a position that 
is committed to international legitimacy, as well as the peace 
initiative that aims to achieve just and comprehensive peace in 
the most dangerous hotbed of tension in the world. 
  AL-BA'TH adds: As for Israel, regardless of its wordplay and 
deception, it cannot cover up for its obstruction of peace 
efforts. Nor can it, for that matter, cover up for its 
continuous crimes in the occupied Arab territories and the 
defenseless Lebanese towns. 
  The paper goes on to say: The recent Israeli escalation, 
which has taken place on the eve of the date set for 
Christopher's new tour of the region, has demonstrated that 
Israel is persisting with its policy of seeking to conclude 
unilateral and separate deals with the Arab sides. This 
escalation is also part of efforts to bring pressure to bear on 
Syria to make it change its firm and principled position on the 
peace process. 
  But, it remains to be said, AL-BA'TH says, that the language 
of threats and pressures will not undermine the Syrian position. 
  The paper concludes by saying: If the U.S. secretary of 
state were to suddenly decide on a quick return to the region, 
he must use various cards that could help him make progress. 
This is necessary if his country is to play the role of a full 
partner and an honest broker, as his administration has 
repeatedly said it would. The party that is obstructing the 
peace process; namely, Israel, must be the target of this role. 
  In the "With the Events" column, AL-BA'TH comments on the 
dangers posed by the Zionist onslaught against Arab Jerusalem. 
  Under the headline "There Can Be No Peace Without Syria," 
the 
newspaper TISHRIN notes that U.S. officials have ruled out a 
possible tour of the Middle East by U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher at present. The paper also notes Israel's 
efforts to deceive the world public and conceal its constant 
attempts to scuttle the peace process by thwarting the efforts 
under way to advance the peace talks. 
  TISHRIN adds: As is well known to everybody, Syria has 
declared its clear commitment to implementing the relevant UN 
Security Council resolutions and meeting all the requirements of 
just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. It has matched 
words with deeds, and repeatedly helped save the peace process 
from Israeli conspiracies in order to render the U.S. efforts a 
success. Israel alone has deliberately tried to obstruct the 
peace process. It has publicly called for replacing the 
Washington talks, which are based on the Madrid formula, with 
separate negotiations. 
  TISHRIN goes on to say: The new Israeli escalation in 
southern Lebanon confirms anew the Tel Aviv government's 
rejection of just and comprehensive peace, the relevant UN 
Security Council resolutions, and the land-for-peace formula. 
  Concluding its commentary, TISHRIN argues that it is 
impossible to achieve peace in the region without an effective 
U.S. intervention, and unless the U.S. commitments and pledges 
are translated into acts and realities on the ground through 
pressures on Israel to make it abandon its obstructionist 
approach and succumb to international legitimacy. 
  The paper adds: Syria is eager to achieve peace. Its 
efforts to achieve it are unmistakable. Nonetheless, Syria 
seeks to restore all its territories. For Syria cannot abandon 
its territories, nor can it bargain over these territories. And 
without Syria, there can be no peace in the Middle East. 
  In the "Opinion" column, the newspaper TISHRIN comments on 
the dangers posed by the Israeli Judaization and settlement plan 
in the occupied territories. It also views neofascism in Italy 
under the "Viewpoint" column. 
  Under the headline "Between Two Stands," the newspaper 
AL-THAWRAH says: The entire world community, and the U.S. 
Administration in particular, has seen Syria's eagerness to 
achieve just and comprehensive peace on the basis of the 
principles on which the Madrid conference convened--the 
principles pertaining to the implementation of the relevant 
resolutions, particularly the principle of trading land for 
peace. 
  AL-THAWRAH adds: The fact that is widely known to the entire 
world community is that Syria's serious approach toward the 
issue of achieving just and comprehensive peace is not a 
transient development. Syria has always championed the cause of 
peace, and favorably responded to all the efforts and 
initiatives grounded in international legitimacy and the 
restoration of territories and rights. 
  The U.S. administration, through President Clinton, has 
repeatedly expressed its convictions regarding Syria's truthful 
peace intentions, noting that Syria has responded to all peace 
efforts to render the peace process a success. 
  AL-THAWRAH goes on to say: Israel has demonstrated that it 
is opposed to just, comprehensive, and viable peace. This is 
because it is adhering to the strategy of expansion and holding 
on to the occupied Arab territories. It is not contributing to 
the success of the peace process. As a matter of fact, it is 
doing all it can to scuttle the peace process to cause it to 
collapse and render it void of any meaningful content. Syria 
has declared its willingness to meet the demands of the 
international community with regard to the implementation of 
international legitimacy resolutions, because it believes that 
the terms of reference of the peace process upheld by the 
cosponsors of this process are in line with its pro-peace 
approach, which is tantamount to a full-blown strategy, 
particularly since the issue at stake is the restoration of all 
rights, and all occupied territories. 
  AL-THAWRAH concludes by saying: Syria has demonstrated a 
credible peace stance. In the same vein, it has addressed a 
letter to the entire world community, saying that it cannot 
abandon a single iota of its national soil, and that the Israeli 
version of peace is unviable, because Israel wants to achieve 
peace and maintain the occupation of Arab territories. 
  In another commentary, AL-THAWRAH says: Undoubtedly, Israel 
will be mistaken if it believes that it can promote its 
erroneous concepts and ideas regarding the achievement of peace 
in the region. It must realize quite well that Syria, without 
which there can be no peace, will accept nothing short of a just 
and comprehensive peace that would ensure the restoration of all 
occupied Arab territories to their rightful owners. If Israel 
is truly seeking peace, it must realize that peace is achievable 
only when the last Israeli soldier is evicted from the last inch 
of the occupied Golan territory, and other occupied territories.

<F P=106> [Report by Muhammad Dalbah] </F>
  [Text] Tunis -- Sudanese Foreign Minister Dr. Husayn 
Sulayman Abu-Salih has ruled out his country's participation in 
the multilateral talks at the present time. In an interview 
with AL-DUSTUR while attending the 30th Organization of African 
Unity [OAU] summit, the Sudanese foreign minister said that 
Israel is supplying the rebel movement in southern Sudan with 
weapons. He said: We call for ending foreign interference. 
He added: How can you ask me to hold negotiations with you 
while you stab me in the back and harm me? 
  He said: If there is a genuine approach to peace and 
noninterference in the affairs of others, and if there is to be 
coexistence, then all causes for harm, war, and sedition must be 
eliminated. Only then, can we hold dialogue within a political 
body of scholars, intellectuals, and others. Until then, it is 
impossible to think about that. 
  On the southern Sudanese problem and the rebellion led by 
John Garang, he said that foreign assistance comes from across 
the Sudanese-Ugandan border where he has a very narrow strip of 
a few km long. There are contacts with Uganda on not having any 
party carry out actions that harm the other party, or offering 
any kind of services that facilitate the passage of weapons or 
other things. This will help expedite the attainment of peace. 
  On the relationship with the United States in light of the 
visit by U.S. Envoy Melissa Wells to Khartoum, Abu-Salih said 
that at one time the West, in general, was prejudiced against 
the present Sudanese government. He said: I believe that this 
was the result of false information. He added: Our people 
have never wished to antagonize the West and have never 
boycotted it. Our people believe that there should be many 
fields of cooperation with the West such as cooperaton in 
development, economy, science and technology, and other fields. 
We refuse any kind of high-handed approach, domination, or 
interference in Sudan's domestic affairs. In view of the 
misleading information, the West, at one time, adopted a 
pressurizing stand toward Sudan by not holding any talks or 
dialogue with the Sudanese government in order to remove it. 
Abu-Salih accused the British government of giving the United 
States an erroneous picture about Sudan. He said: The United 
Kingdom did a lot to spread rumors and disseminate misleading 
information that distorted Sudan's image and portrayed Sudan in 
a bad light. That's why the dialogue with the Americans is 
aimed at giving a true picture about Sudan in terms of its 
cooperation with others. 
  Abu-Salih said that dialogue was initiated following the 
visit by the U.S. UN Envoy Madeleine Albright to Khartoum 
earlier this year. This means that there is someone who is now 
willing to listen. The mere holding of a serious dialogue makes 
us hopful of reaching some formula for cooperation with a major 
country like the United States. 
  Abu-Salih said he believes the pressure the United States 
and 
the West used to put on Sudan had to do with Sudan's stand on 
the Arab- Israeli conflict. 
  He said: I will speak frankly. The Americans used to 
believe that we would lead the Arab and Islamic opposition, and 
all those who oppose a settlement with the Israelis. That's why 
they placed us on the terrorist list. Abu-Salih said that 
Albright emerged from her visit with a good impression. He said 
Albright discussed with Sudanese officials her belief that Sudan 
harbors terrorism. We told her that all these accusations are 
baseless. This impression can only be enhanced through further 
dialogue, contacts, and visits. Abu-Salih said: The Sudanese, 
by nature, are against terrorism. We can wage war against you, 
but we will never harm innocent people. 
  Abu-Salih added: The Americans used to think that the 
camps that we have for training the popular defense to support 
the Sudanese Army were camps for training foreigners to 
destabilize other countries. 
  Abu-Salih said his government challenges anyone to prove 
that 
a single foreigner was trained in Sudan. We are hurt when 
others interfere in our affairs. Therefore, we do not interfere 
in the affairs of others. He referred, in this context, to the 
relationship with Iran. He said the United States and other 
Western and non-Western nations speak about Sudan as if it were 
under Iranian control or a base for Iran. This is not true. 
Our relationship with Iran is similar to our relationship with 
any Western country, and that is all. However, it is totally 
untrue to say that Sudan is under the control of Iran or in the 
grip of Iran. Perhaps, I would not be revealing a secret if I 
said that our relationship with Iran was sometimes weaker than 
our relationship with some Western nations and that our 
cooperation with some Western nations was greater than that with 
Iran. 
  Abu-Salih added: The visits of Albright and then Melissa 
Wells represent the beginning of dialogue between us and the 
Americans. The visits were made at a time when we asked the 
neighboring states, such as Kenya, Uganda, and Ethiopia, to 
observe the implementation of peace. Of course, we consult with 
the U.S. ambassador in Khartoum and with the neighboring states 
to achieve this purpose. 
  He added that he had asked the Americans about how to come 
up 
with a realistic formula for unity in Sudan that can be 
protected and maintained and how to please all Sudanese within 
the context of equality, sovereignty, justice, and no 
discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, and tribal 
affiliation. He said: In order to reach this formula, we have 
made many concessions. This is why we asked for not using the 
terms secular and nonsecular. We are about to prepare our 
document on sharing of power and resources and providing 
everything for the citizens to ensure success. Abu-Salih 
explained that Sudan had asked the Americans to benefit from 
their experts regarding the federal system and to give Sudan a 
plan and a model to enable it to arrive at this formula in a 
multilingual, multiracial Sudan. We want to maintain the 
Sudanese identity and we want citizenship to be the basis of 
participation. However, the movement that is led by Garang, 
which is linked to foreign powers, does not wish to see a 
solution through. 
  On the relationship with Egypt in light of the dispute over 
the Hala'ib region, the Sudanese foreign minister said the 
relationship should be distinguished and integral, even a 
relationship of unity. However, this cannot be achieved without 
removing the differences between the two countries. He said 
there are three issues that should be addressed: 
  The first has to do with Egypt's occupation of Hala'ib. The 
Egyptians do not like to talk about this issue. We are talking 
about a triangle and this means a piece of land. However, the 
Egyptians are talking about parallel 22, which is not an expanse 
of land. 
  The area of Hala'ib amounts to 36,000 square km. According 
to the Sudanese foreign minister, Hala'ib is Sudanese land 
because there are Sudanese tribes in it that use a non-Arabic 
language. No one in Egypt speaks any language other than 
Arabic. Hala'ib is also considered a Sudanese electoral 
constituency. They told us that they plan to have two 
constituencies at Hala'ib. However, Egyptian legislators and 
lawmen talk about the annexation of Hala'ib. This means Hala'ib 
is a usurped piece of Sudan. Had it been Egyptian territory, it 
would have been part of Egyptian constituencies a long time ago. 
The question of Hala'ib was raised in 1958, but the late 
Egyptian President Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir froze the issue at the 
time after showing understanding of the situation and 
withdrawing the Egyptian troops. 
  Abu-Salih revealed that the Egyptian military presence in 
Hala'ib had taken place with Sudan's approval as Sudan has given 
Egypt 10 observation posts there, and that the Egyptians are now 
occupying these 10 posts. 
  Abu-Salih stressed that Sudan accepts any Arab mediation or 
arbitration, or the referral of the issue to the International 
Court of Justice because we have a right to that area. Sudan is 
not made up of Hala'ib only. Sudan's area is around 1 million 
square miles. But what has pained us is that Hala'ib has been 
taken by force. We are against such a method and this issue 
must be settled. He said he changed his mind about submitting 
the Hala'ib issue for discussion at the OAU summit after some 
African countries advised him that it would be better if other 
parties do not intervene between Sudan and Egypt. He said: We 
withdrew the issue but insisted that there should be 
negotiations and a solution, and that Hala'ib is Sudanese. 
  Abu-Salih said that following the meeting between Egyptian 
President Husni Mubarak and his Sudanese counterpart 'Umar al- 
Bashir, the two countries' foreign ministers were charged with 
studying the issue and proposing a solution. He said that he 
went to Egypt seven times to discuss the issue with Egyptian 
Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, who, as yet, has not paid a single 
visit to Sudan. He stressed that, for sure, this issue is one 
of occupation. We do not want to exacerbate the situation. But, 
like so many others, we do not want to keep Hala'ib under 
occupation. The Hala'ib issue might lead to many things. It 
may bring about war. However, he said that both parties act in a 
calm manner although there are Egyptian and Sudanese troops in 
the area. 
  Abu-Salih said: The second issue deals with the Sudanese 
opposition. The Egyptians say that Egypt is the mother of all 
and that they cannot refuse any demand. However, Abu-Salih said 
that this does not mean that everyone should be given the right 
to write in the opposition press, participate in its actvities, 
or finance it. He said that this issue in Egyptian-Sudanese 
relations is a secondary issue. 
  The Sudanese minister said that the third and very important 
issue is that of trust between Egypt and Sudan. Abu-Salih 
stressed that there is no trust between the two sides. Egypt 
does not trust the ruling regime in Sudan and says that it is a 
regime which represents the Islamic National Front. We also do 
not trust them. Abu-Salih said that had it not been for the 
Sudanese people's support for the ideas and concepts of the 
present regime in Sudan, which have been discussed in more than 
25 conferences on political, social, peace, and economic issues, 
the present regime in Sudan would not have remained in power. 
  Abu-Salih sharply criticized they way in which Cairo deals 
with the regime in Sudan. They say that this is al-Turabi's 
government or the regime of Hasan al-Turabi, and speak only 
about Egypt's interests, Egypt's history, and Egyptian 
sacrifices. This means they do not trust us, and we also do not 
trust them. Had they wanted relations to retun to normal, they 
would have exchanged visits with us. They want us to hold 
discussions and dialogue with them but they refuse to have such 
discussions in Khartoum or in any other Arab or nonArab country? 
They do not want to discuss things with us. He said: There 
is no doubt that Egyptian officials are under the illusion that 
the Sudanese government might collapse at any moment. They will 
deal with the government on which they can impose their will. 
But, we say that our government is there to stay and will 
fight. This also means that there will be rivers of blood if 
this government does not fall.

afternoon's bomb blast in the mausoleum of Imam Reza (a.s.) 
[peace be upon him]. 
  A caller to IRNA who called himself the spokesman for the 
terrorist Mojahedeen Khalq Organization (MKO) said that MKO has 
taken the full responsiblity for the blast. The caller said 
that the bombing was meant to avenge the death of "martyrs of 
June 20th uprising". He said that MKO was planning more acts of 
subversion in "the following days." The caller then finished 
his conversation, which lasted for 90 seconds, by yelling 
obscenities at the officials of the Islamic Republic of Iran and 
hung up. 
  On June 20, 1981 MKO operatives began their campaign of 
terror against the then nascent Islamic Republic of Iran.

  [Excerpt] Today, on the day of Husayn's 'Ashura and 
simultaneous with the mourning ceremonies for the Lord of the 
Martyrs Aba 'Abdallah al-Husayn, peace be upon him, and at a 
time when Islamic Iran was engulfed in mourning and the holy 
shrine of Imam Reza was particularly filled with lovers of 
Prophet Muhammad's household, unfortunately a bomb exploded 
inside the Imam Reza's shrine. Reports received indicate that 
dozens were martyred or injured. 
  The accident happened when the pilgrims were mourning the 
anniversary of the demise of the Lord of the Martyrs and the 
area around the shrine was filled with mourners. The pictures 
you can see now were taken a few hours after this heart-rending 
incident, which was perpetrated by the ruthless hypocrites 
[Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization]. As a result of this 
unprecedented crime part of the holy shrine was also destroyed. 
  A statement obtained in Mashhad in the wake of this 
heart-rending tragedy shows that the hypocrites committed this 
criminal deed. 
  A report prepared by our correspondent, who arrived at the 
scene of tragedy few minutes after the incident, indicates that 
the bomb weighed perhaps about five kilos and was planted under 
a column above the holy shrine, in the south-western sector of 
the eighth Imam's grave site. 
  It is necessary to mention hat several years ago too, the 
hypocrites intended to carry out a similar criminal deed in the 
holy shrine of Imam Reza, but the agents responsible were 
arrested. Their action today was perpetrated to mark the 
anniversary of the 20 June 1981 incident. On that day the 
ruthless hypocrites staged a last-ditch movement against the 
sacred regime of the Islamic Republic. But they were crushed, 
thanks to the people's presence and ever-lasting unity. [passage

  [Text] Dear viewers: I have just been informed that His 
Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, the esteemed leader of the Islamic 
revolution, has sent the following message: 
  In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. 
[Koranic 
verse in Arabic omitted] We belong to God and to God we shall 
return. With sorrow and regret we were informed that the 
criminal hand of the enemies of Islam has been tainted with a 
great crime and, by desecrating the holy and pure shrine of Imam 
Reza, they have massacred a number of innocent people at the 
holy shrine of the eighth Imam, peace be upon him, on Imam 
Husayn's 'Ashura. 
  With this action the hypocritical, hostile, and cruel 
enemies 
have shown that they adhere to no humanitarian standards, and 
that their enmity against the brave and pious nation has no 
bounds or limits. 
  The blind-hearted and treacherous hypocrites [Mojahedin-e 
Khalq] have shown that they attach no value to the holy shrine 
of the member of the household of piety and purity; that such a 
great and holy time and place is no obstacle to their 
bloodthirsty and bestial nature and their savage grudge against 
the Iranian nation. The curse of God and His subjects be on 
those criminal hands and those black hearts. 
  With such deeds the enemies of the Iranian nation have 
demonstrated their weakness and impotence and proved that they 
are doomed to isolation and destruction. 
  I express condolences to the Hidden Imam and to those 
families whose dear ones have been sacrificed because of the 
malevolence and crime of the enemies and to the great, brave, 
and steadfast nation of Islamic Iran. I pray that those 
martyred in this heart-rending tragedy will receive the loftiest 
rank. 
  I call on the authorities and the law-enforcement bodies to 
seriously pursue the perpetrators of this crime and, in the 
shortest possible time, bring to justice those blood-sucking 
bats. [Koranic verse in Arabic] And those who do wrong shall 
surely know by what overturning they will be overturned.

  [Text] In a statement just released, the Cabinet of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran expressed its condolences following 
this tragedy and announced that 21 June would be a national day 
of mourning throughout the country. The text of the statement 
follows: 
  In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. We 
belong to God and to Him we return. On the anniversary of the 
martyrdom of the lord of the freedom-loving people of the world, 
Husayn Bin Ali, peace be upon him, and the devoted children and 
followers of that immaculate imam, and when the lovers of the 
school of Husayn and followers of the of guardianship in 
mourning at the shrine of the honorable descendent of the lord 
of the martyrs, His Holiness Ali Bin Musa al-Rida, the cowardly 
monafeqin, who have not stopped committing crimes since the 
victory of revolution, once again in a cowardly act shed the 
blood of the mourners of Husayn, just as the hated idol regime 
which shed the blood of mourners on the day of Ashura. 
  The Mojahedin-e Khalq martyred and injured a number of 
innocent people at the shrine of His Holiness Rida, peace be 
upon him. Obviously, history shall not forget this great 
disrespect to the position of velayat and imamate of His 
Holiness Rida, peace be upon him, in whose holy shrine and on 
the day of Husayn's Ashura this crime took place. The hand of 
divine revenge will squeeze the throats of all evil cowards, who 
have planned and carried out such a horrific crime. The cabinet 
of the Islamic Republic of Iran, while expressing 
congratulations and condolences to the Lord of the Age; his 
rightful representative the esteemed leader; the sources of 
emulation; grand ayatollahs; the heroic, martyr-nurturing and 
brave people of Islamic Iran; the lovers of the school of Husayn 
and the followers of Imam Khomeyni, God's blessings be upon him, 
declares tomorrow, Tuesday, 21 June, a day of national mourning 
throughout the country; and Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday as 
days of mourning for Khorasan Province. The cabinet prays for 
forgiveness for the great martyrs, for patience for the families 
of the martyrs and for rapid recovery of the injured.

  [Text] Tehran, June 20, IRNA -- The terrorist Mojahedeen 
Khalq Organization (MKO) has once again committed a heinous 
crime, this time at the mausoleum of Imam Reza (A.S.) [peace be 
upon him]. 
  Since June 20, 1981, the people of Iran have been victimized 
by this terrorist outfit that has always underestimated the 
resolve and the indomitable spirit of the people of Iran, a 
spirit that will not allow the MKO to reach its unholy aims. 
  The formation of the so called Liberation Army in Iraq on 
the 
part of the MKO at a time when parts of Islamic Iran was 
occupied by Ba'thist forces was another vain attempt by MKO to 
get out of the impasse in which they found themselves. 
  Repeated setbacks, including their notorious failure in 
Mersad operations, caused many of MKO rank and file to be 
disenchanted with the leadership. 
  Most political observers believe that by targeting the 
people 
as they did today they are stepping on the same path as Saddam's 
regime that victimized the Iranian civilian populace instead of 
facing the valiant Iranian forces at the front. 
  As a matter of fact the post-revolution history of MKO 
testifies to the fact that they have preferred to target the 
innocent people. 
  Just recently, a failed attempt by MKO on the life of 
Hojjatoleslam Abaie, the Friday prayer leader of Mashhad, was 
meant to create the same sense of insecurity here in this city. 
  Today's crime in the mausoleum of Imam Reza was a terrorist 
act for which the MKO is directly held responsible. In addition 
to the terrorist MKO, their supporters such as Saddam's regime, 
the U.S., Britain and some European countries who have spared no 
efforts in supporting the terrorist outfit have to answer to the 
people of Iran why the innocent people were so butchered today 
at a mausoleum whose sanctity for centuries no one had dared to 
violate, a place wherein up to today no one had dared to shed 
anyone's blood.

<F P=106> [Commentary by News Research and Commentary Group] </F>
  [Text] In the name of God. The terroristic and shattering 
incident which resulted from the Monafeqin 
[hypocrites--pejorative term for Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization, 
MKO] planting a bomb in the holy shrine of the eighth imam, 
peace be upon him, which has resulted in over 100 martyred and 
injured, has greatly wounded the religious and human 
sensitivities of the Iranian people and the Muslims of the 
world. It has generated a wave of abhorrence among the people 
and the officials and is being condemned at home and abroad. 
  The question that arises here is: What was the objective 
behind this unprecedented crime? Why did the cold-hearted 
Monafeqin choose a holy site such as the hallowed shrine of Imam 
Reza--peace be upon him--for this crime and why violate its 
sanctity? 
  According to political observers, the firm bond between the 
people and the Islamic system is the most important objective 
that the criminals have targeted in this latest atrocity. Right 
from the onset of the [Iranian] sixties decade, when the 
misanthropic visage of the Monafeqin was revealed, the bond 
between the devout Muslim people of Iran and the Islamic system 
has constantly been the target of their attacks. However, due 
to the popular bias of the Islamic system which is endowed with 
an extensive popular base as well, all the plots of the 
Monafeqin against this system were foiled. 
  Following the demise of Imam Khomeyni, the great leader of 
the Islamic Revolution--may God's peace be upon him--the powers 
of world arrogance have sought to drive a wedge between the 
people and the Islamic system by resuming their plots. The 
grand ceremonies on the anniversary of the demise of the imam a 
few weeks ago and the extensive support and allegiance of the 
people for the lofty status of the Velayat-e Faqih [supreme 
jurisconsult], once again inflicted defeat on the powers of 
world arrogance. 
  Failure to undermine or change the course of the Islamic 
Revolution has aroused the ire of the powers of world arrogance 
and its hypocrite agents to the extent that on the anniversary 
of Husayn's 'Ashura [tenth day of Moharram, when Prophet 
Muhammad's grandson, Husayn, was martyred], they attacked a 
group of mourning people of Iran in the holiest site in our 
country. This atrocity, however distasteful, has been endured 
with Husayn-like revolutionary fortitude by the Muslim people of 
Iran. Similar crimes by the blind-hearted [kurdel] Monafeqin, 
which include their attacks on worshipers at Friday 
congregations, the martyring of some Friday imams and people, 
have not been able to disrupt the bond between the people and 
the system. On the contrary, these crimes have served to 
further consolidate this bond and thus to disgrace the enemies 
of the people and Islam, more than ever.

  [Text] The Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization [MKO] vehemently 
condemned the bomb explosion on Monday morning in Mashhad and 
announced: The Khomeyni regime's linking this criminal act to 
the Mojahedin and the Iranian Resistance is an absolute lie. 
  The MKO office in Paris issued a statement declaring this 
stance, saying: An MKO spokesman vehemently condemned the 
explosion at the shrine of Imam Reza, peace be upon him, in the 
holy city of Mashhad and has said that the Khomeyni regime's 
linking such a criminal act to the Mojahedin and the Iranian 
Resistance is an absolute lie and its objective is merely to 
tarnish the image of the just and extensive resistance of the 
people of Iran against the religious and terrorist dictatorship 
of the clerics. 
  This spokesman added: The Iranian Resistance would never 
resort to such criminal actions which would desecrate the 
sanctity of the infallible imams, and would cause such an 
extensive loss of life and [word indistinct] among the innocent 
people. This filthy and criminal action is only in the interest 
of the clerical regime. 
  On numerous occasions in the past, the regime has planted 
bombs and resorted to such acts, including hurling a grenade at 
the French Embassy and the Air France office in Tehran, 
ascribing these acts to the MKO. 
  We now draw your attention to the interview by the leader of 
the Iranian Resistance, brother mojahed Mas'ud Rajavi, on the 
atrocity perpetrated on Monday by the misanthropic clerics in 
the hallowed precincts of the shrine of Imam Reza, peace be upon 
him. 
  Mas'ud Rajavi, leader of the Iranian Resistance, condemned 
the heinous atrocity of an explosion in the sacred precincts of 
Imam Reza's shrine in Mashhad by the terrorist dictatorship of 
the clerics on 'Ashura [tenth day of Moharram] which resulted in 
martyring and wounding a large number of innocent pilgrims and 
damage to the tomb of Imam Reza, peace be upon him, and he 
conveyed his condolences to the people of Iran. He described it 
as a profane, antihuman, and anti-Islamic crime on the part of 
the ruling tyrannical Yazidi [Yazid was Umayyad Caliph in 
Damascus, and considered a heretic] clerics. 
  The leader of the Iranian Resistance stressed that the 
objective of the Khomeyni regime in staging the explosion in the 
holy precincts of the Imam Reza shrine, linking it to the MKO, 
is nothing but a precursor to a series of terrorist acts in the 
future against the Iranian Resistance which in the past have 
included the aerial attack on the National Liberation Army 
bases, explosions in offices and bases of the Iranian 
Resistance, and the assassinations of Resistance activists 
abroad. 
  Some days ago, the Khomeyni regime disseminated consummate 
lies, claiming that the MKO had launched an attack on the Ilam 
border, western Iran, in which some persons had been killed and 
wounded. 
  Rajavi added: The criminal clerics are entrenched in a deep 
political and economic crisis and are unable to combat the 
proliferating dissatisfaction and increasing resistance by the 
Iranian people. They do not find any recourse but to embark on 
such inauspicious and bestial crimes and in the holy precincts 
of the Imam Reza shrine at that. This is an unprecedented crime 
which no other dictator has resorted to before. 
  Rajavi stressed: The cruel clerics have--since the heroic 
uprising by the people of Mashhad--[words indistinct] continued 
to seek revenge and harassed the people of Khorasan Province and 
the pilgrims to the shrine of Imam Reza. He continued: The 
Khomeyni regime is seeking to justify its next crime and thus to 
arouse the religious sentiments of the people and to tarnish the 
face of the MKO, who--because of their deep devotion to Islam, 
the religion of mercy and liberation--enjoy greater credibility 
among the Iranian people. They therefore chose the day of 
'Ashura, the site of the holy shrine of Imam Reza, and the 
anniversary of 30 Khordad--the day when the MKO uprising against 
the regime was initiated--for perpetrating this crime. 
  The statement issued immediately by Khamene'i, the leader of 
the clerical regime, linking this explosion to the MKO, and the 
threatening propaganda by the regime, based on vengeance against 
the MKO, are part of this previously formulated scenario. 
  While recalling the setting on fire of the Rex Theater in 
Abadan, and the killing of innocent people in the last few 
months of the shah's rule, the setting ablaze [as heard] of the 
precincts of the Holy Ka'bah by agents of the Khomeyni regime in 
1366 [year beginning 21 March 1987] Rajavi emphasized that the 
clerical regime--despite its claims to being a protector of 
Islam--has gone a step further and has massacred innocent 
pilgrims in the Imam Reza shrine, the most hallowed site in all 
of Iran. The unprecedented crime is an indication of the 
incurable crises in Iran, and the abject impotence of the 
clerics before the resistance of the Iranian people. 
  He added: In addition, the vestiges of the Khomeyni 
regime--in view of the lack of participation on the part of the 
people in the anniversary ceremonies for Khomeyni--are seeking 
to damage the Imam Reza shrine and by violating its sanctity, 
they wish to replace it with the temple of idols in which 
Khomeyni is interred. Rajavi called on the United Nations, 
Islamic Conference Organization, the Islamic governments, 
international organizations that are defenders of human rights 
to condemn this appalling atrocity and to send a team to Iran to 
investigate this crime. 
  In order to thwart any deceitful actions by the clerical 
regime, the Iranian Resistance deems the presence of its 
representatives necessary in an international delegation to 
investigate this incident. This is the insistent demand of the 
people and the Resistance of Iran to the international community 
who should not permit the criminal clerics to escape unscathed 
after committing such an unprecedented crime. 
  [Signed] The Secretariat of the National Resistance Council 
of Iran

  [Text] Tehran, June 21, IRNA -- The Islamic Consultative 
Assembly (Majles) in an announcement Monday strongly condemned 
the criminal act by the Mojahedin-e Terrorist Organization (MKO) 
in bombing the mausoleum of Imam Reza (A.S.) [peace be upon him] 
and said that the crime has added to the record of subservience 
of the MKO grouplet to the global arrogance. 
  The announcement further added that the dreadful incident 
has 
not only injured the feelings of Iranians but those of other 
Muslims throughout the world. 
  The bomb went off in one of the crowded prayer halls of the 
mausoleum Monday afternoon, killing 25 and injuring 70 pilgrims 
who were mourning Ashura, martyrdom anniversary of Imam Hoseyn, 
third member of the household of the Prophet (pbuh) [peace be 
upon him]. 
  Agents of global arrogance have committed many crimes in the 
post-revolution era, the announcement said adding that such a 
sacrilege act was another black page of the record of the 
traitor MKOs. 
  Condemning the terrorist act, the announcement condoled the 
leader of the Islamic revolution Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i and 
bereaved families of the martyrs. 
  In another development, head of the Islamic Propagation 
Organization (IPO), Hojjat ol-Eslam Mahmud Mohamadi 'Araqi sent 
a message to the leader of the Islamic revolution, expressing 
condolence over the incident. 
  The official also called on the security, law-enforcement 
and 
judiciary forces to take speedy measures for the arrest of the 
culprits.

  [Text] President Hashemi-Rafsanjani, while expressing 
condolences on the innocent martyrdom of the pilgrims of the 
Haram-e Imam Reza, may peace be upon him, in the hands of 
anti-revolutionary and savage people, stated that this bitter 
incident on Ashura day, when the Iranian people's attentions 
were focused on Karbala, showed more clearly the nasty nature of 
the enemy of Islam and Monafeqin [Mojahedin-e Khalq 
Organization, MKO] and caused great shame to their supporters 
who have given them safety and provided them with propaganda 
means and possibilities; and backs them. 
  Our country's president who was speaking this morning at a 
meeting with the officials of the Ministry of Housing and Urban 
Development and Housing Foundation, added that the Muslim nation 
of Iran has experienced such difficult and bitter incidents 
before, however, this shocking crime of such magnitude, and in a 
holy place next to the sacred tomb of Imam Reza, may peace be 
upon him, created a new situation of bitterness among our people. 
  Hashemi-Rafsanjani stressed that this shows the foolishness 
and height of their evilness to slaughter the pilgrims of Imam 
Reza who had come with great difficulties from various villages 
and cities to visit the holy shrine and were engaged in 
performing their prayers. This action will further increase the 
awareness and loyalty of the people and is proof of the 
rightfulness of the sacred regime of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran. 
  At this meeting, which was held on the occasion of the 
anniversary of the earthquake that occurred in Gaylan and 
Zanjan, the president said that planting a bomb and killing 
innocent people in a place where there has never been security 
obstacles does not require guerrilla power and bravery, and 
proves only their lack of goal and savagery.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati by </F>
unidentified correspondent; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] What is the major problem in the way 
of peace in Tajikistan? 
  [Velayati] In the name of God, the compassionate, the 
merciful [preceding phrase in Arabic]. The main problem is the 
lack of mutual understanding, which has been available since the 
very beginning of negotiations. But this problem needs time to 
be solved. I mean, if we want to solve this problem we need 
more time. If you take a look at the result of the talks that 
they had in Moscow and also the preliminary statement that they 
had in ceremonial session, you will see that may be there are 
some progress. As I said in my interview, at the beginning they 
were not ready to talk together. And both of them used to be 
very angry against another one. Now the nature of their 
presence is a positive step which has been taken by them. So we 
can say that cautiously we are optimistic and we do hope that 
after few days of talks they can reach some more positive 
points. This is the national desire of the people of 
Tajikistan. They want to put an end to these internal conflict 
because they have lost many lives and they are facing, the 
people of Tajikistan are facing a national disaster. They have 
difficulties even for providing the raw material for their very 
simple life. Lack of sanitation, lack of food, lack of 
transportation, continuation of killing and slaughters and 
assassination have made the people of Tajikistan frustrated. 
People are very disappointed. That is the national desire that 
now the time is ripe for a national reconciliation. 
  [Correspondent] It seems no specific plan for restoring 
peace 
in Tajikistan has been offered. Do you think a clear peace plan 
will come under discussion in the current round of negotiations 
in Tehran? 
  [Velayati] Of course, this is the task of the special envoy 
of the secretary general of the United Nations. But as far as 
we could understand of what he has said he has tried to make a 
cease-fire at the beginning as a fist step; because the 
establishment of the cease-fire will give opportunity to both 
sides for continuation of talks and decreasing of tension; while 
the continuation of assassination and killing and slaughters 
will increase tension. And if tension is increased or is being 
increased they cannot stop the hostility. So, the cease-fire is 
the first step that should be established unconditionally, 
without any precondition. That is what we could understand from 
the special envoy of the secretary general of the United Nations.

  [Excerpt] His Majesty King Husayn on Monday [20 June] held 
talks with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and said 
he was very pleased with the progress achieved in the 
Jordanian-Israeli tracks of negotiations and expressed hope that 
the other tracks in the Arab-Israeli peace process would also 
achieve similar progress. 
  The King, speaking at the State Department, also paid 
tribute 
to the U.S. efforts that went to advancing the negotiations. 
  "We are indeed optimistic as far as the future is concerned 
in our quest for a just, durable and comprehensive peace," the 
King told reporters. "We are very happy indeed that on the 
Jordanian-Israeli track we are about to begin to address the 
problems that were part of the agenda worked out earlier and 
beginning with border demarcation, delineation. 
  "We appreciate certainly the role of our friends in 
supporting us and our effort to arrive at this point." 
  The King was asked whether Jordan would sign a peace accord 
with Israel without waiting for Syria. The King replied, "We 
hope to see better support. But regarding us, we follow the 
Jordanian dimensions of the problems which we have started 
together from the same point... and as our brethren in Syria are 
negotiating, we are negotiating at the same time." 
  Asked if Jordan would sign a peae treaty with Israel if the 
Kingdom and the Jewish state could reach one before Syria and 
Lebanon did, the King said: 
  "It is a difficult question, and I would like to say that 
Jordan is practising its sovereignty and is dealing with its 
causes and the way to finding a solution to them. I hope that 
progress would take place on all other tracks to achieve 
comprehensive peace." 
  Asked whether he had recently met with Israeli Prime 
Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin in London as suggested in some reports, the King 
said: "I do not confirm or deny such news." 
  At another point the King said, "I've never been afraid of 
daylight" and "the opportunity will come sometime soon for a 
meeting between Israeli and Jordanian officials." [passage

<F P=106> [Report on news conference by King Husayn and U.S. Secretary </F>
of State Warren Christopher with unidentified correspondents; 
place and date not given -- in English] 
  [Excerpts] His Majesty King Husayn has started an official 
visit to the United States. Observers and political analysts 
described the visit as extremely important and said it will be a 
new turning point in Jordanian-U.S. relations. His majesty the 
king began his visit by meeting with U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher, who received his majesty outside the State 
Department in Washington. The latest developments of the peace 
talks, particularly on the Jordanian-Israeli track and the 
recent Middle East developments, in addition to bilateral 
relations, are expected to be discussed. [passage omitted] 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent] Your Highness: When will 
you finally meet Israeli leaders face to face in open broad 
daylight? When will you pray in Jerusalem? Do you accept the 
Israelis' position that Jerusalem is open religiously, but 
closed politically? I am [words indistinct]. Thank you. 
  [King Husayn] I've never been afraid of daylight, sir. In 
fact, I've always thrived living in daylight and I hope that the 
opportunity will come sometime soon for meetings at the highest 
possible levels between Jordanians and Israeli officials and I 
hope that the beginning that we will see in the very coming 
future will enable us to progress to the point where such a 
meeting will be held. 
  [Correspondent] What about peace in Syria? Nothing seems to 
be happening. The Syrians are saying they are waiting for 
answers from you and the Americans are still waiting for answers 
from the Syrians. What's going on? Is there any hope for real 
progress this summer? 
  [Christopher] Yes, I think there is hope for progress 
because 
the leaders of both countries seem to be very, very serious 
about negotiations and I'll expect that before the summer is out 
we will see some progress is made. There are very difficult 
questions on that track as there are on all the tracks, but when 
the leaders are seriously engaged, when they're wrestling with 
the hardest underlined problems, the threshold issues, I think 
it's natural that it would take some time and that's what we're 
experiencing at the present time. But I am not at all 
discouraged about the fact that we can make some progress, and I 
agree with the king that it's necessary to see this in a 
comprehensive sense and expect all the tracks to be moving 
forward, not perhaps exactly at the same pace, but nevertheless 
making comprehensive progress. 
  [Correspondent] You mentioned Jordan's role in the Middle 
East peace process and also in previous statements you described 
it as central. So, what do you mean by central and what is the 
United States willing to do to lift the physical and the mental 
siege that (?goes around us during) the past four years? 
  [Christopher] I think the best thing the United States can 
do 
is to play its role as one of the cosponsors of the peace 
process and to encourage the parties to make progress. There 
are still obviously the enemies of peace in the region. We see 
tragic episodes take place, but nevertheless, in an overall 
sense, I do see progress has been made and the role of the 
United States will be to facilitate the negotiations between the 
parties to try to serve the role that we have served from the 
very beginning. [end recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by 'Ali Hamati from Washington] </F>
  [Excerpts] His Majesty King Husayn has said Jordan's 
assumption of its basic and effective role in the peace process 
should be based on a strong Jordan and a solid economic base 
that gives all members of the one large Jordanian family an 
equal opportunity to lead a dignified, secure, and stable life. 
His majesty made these statements during his meeting with U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher at the U.S. State 
Department in Washington. His majesty stressed that Jordan 
adheres to a just, durable, and comprehensive peace in the 
region, indicating that progress on the Jordanian track should 
be an incentive for progress on the other tracks. 
  For his part, Warren Christopher showed a clear 
understanding 
of the Jordanian role in the peace process and of the social and 
economic difficulties caused by this role. He said Washington 
will extend all possible assistance, whose details, he said, 
will be discussed by the joint Jordanian-U.S. committee, which 
will hold its first meeting at the State Department on Wednesday 
[22 June]. 
  His majesty and Secretary Christopher then held an expanded 
session of talks, interrupted by a working luncheon. [passage 
omitted] 
  Later, his majesty the king received U.S. Secretary of 
Commerce Ronald Brown at his place of residence in Washington . 
Bilateral trade relations were discussed during the meeting. 
  His Majesty King Husayn had earlier expressed optimism about 
progress in the Middle East peace process. Speaking to 
reporters at the State Department, he hoped the 
Jordanian-Israeli talks under U.S. sponsorship will lead to the 
demarcation of borders in the near future. Asked when his 
majesty will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, his 
majesty said he has never been afraid of working in daylight. 
He hoped the opportunity will come soon for a meeting between 
Jordanian and Israeli officials at the highest level. He also 
hoped that the near future will witness further progress in the 
peace process. [passage omitted] 
  His majesty the king will hold a news conference later today 
to brief local and world press correspondents on the latest 
developments of the peace process and other important issues. 
  In another development, the Jordanian and U.S. experts held 
a 
meeting at the Jordanian delegation's place of residence in 
Washington at dawn today, Amman time. During this preliminary 
meeting, bilateral relations and the burdens of the peace 
process on Jordan were discussed. The Jordanian side explained 
these burdens.

  [Text] Taysir al-Himsi, secretary of the Supreme Command 
of the Jordanian Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, yesterday held a 
press conference at his party's headquarters to announce the 
resolutions of the party's second congress, which was held 
recently, and the outcome of the elections to the party's 
leadership. 
  Al-Himsi stressed that the congress discussed a number of 
important issues on the local, Arab, and international levels 
and determined its view over these issues in accordance with the 
party's pan-Arab principles and firm position on the central 
causes of the Arab nation. The party, he said, emphasized the 
need for pan-Arab solutions to any regional issue since 
solutions to any regional political or economic issues will be 
incomplete if not discussed and addressed within the framework 
of the comprehensive Arab solution. 
  Al-Himsi said the congress urged all Arab and world 
organizations and parliaments to act to lift the unjust blockade 
imposed on Iraq and stop the bloodshed in fraternal Yemen on the 
basis of preserving its unity and fighting any secessionist 
trend regardless of any motives and reasons. 
  He added that the congress also reviewed the settlement 
plans 
proposed to liquidate the Palestine question, including the 
Gaza-Jericho First plan, the Majdal Shams First plan, and the 
Jordanian-Israeli agenda. The congress reaffirmed the party's 
rejection of the capitulationist trend represented in the Madrid 
and Oslo process and underlined the Ba'th Party's position, 
which states that the Palestine question is the Arabs' central 
cause and no one has the right to a unilateral decision over it. 
The congress further noted that the proposed liquidationist 
plans target the Arab identity and serve as an instrument for 
the attainment of the Zionist dreams. 
  He said the congress also stressed the importance of 
activating and entrenching the democracy process in Jordan as an 
irrevocable alternative and the need to allow all political 
forums -- including parties, organizations, and professional 
associations -- the opportunity to participate in the 
decisionmaking in order to activate and entrench popular 
participation. The congress also stressed the need to provide 
opportunities for others to express their opinion in order to 
strengthen the concept of pluralism and freedom. This, the 
congress says, requires the provision of further freedoms for 
the party newspapers since they represent the views of the 
opposition political forces whose presence provides a safety 
valve in any multi-party democratic march. 
  At the conclusion of his press conference, al-Himsi declared 
the names of the members of the party's supreme command who were 
elected by the congress, These are: Taysir al-Himsi, Adam 
al-'Abdallat, Ahmad al-Mitliq, Jamal al-Rahaminah, 'Abd-al-Majid 
al-Qarari'ah, Sulayman Abu-'Adilah, 'Ayid 'Amayirah, Ahmad 
Irshayd, Akram al- Himsi, Muhammad al-Dakhlallah, and Akram 
al-Nimri. Three reserve members were also elected. These are: 
Samu'il Fakhuri, Khalid al-'Arif, and Faruq al-Za'n.

  [Text] Amman -- The deputies of the Jordanian Islamic 
Action Front [IAF] today denounced the Jordanian-Israeli 
agreements signed recently, considering them a clear recognition 
of the Zionist entity and its usurpation of security, stability, 
and waters in the region. 
  In a statement in Amman today, the deputies said: We think 
that these agreements represent a Jordanian retreat from the 
constant principles reiterated repeatedly by the officials, 
mainly, rejecting unilateral peace, adhering to the Islamic and 
Arab character of Jerusalem, and the right of the refugees to 
return to their usurped country. 
  The Jordanian IAF deputies stressed their condemnation and 
rejection of this approach that is being pursued by the 
Jordanian government, contrary to the attitudes of the Jordanian 
people who reject all these concessions, noting that the opinion 
of the Jordanian people and their representatives was not sought 
on these negotiations that target their land, destiny, and 
future. 
  Also, the Jordanian Arab Constitutional Front Party has 
asserted that Syria represents the strong spirit of the Arabs in 
the face of the enemies of the Arab nation and their supporters. 
  In a statement today, the party said: At a time when we were 
expecting to consolidate and expand cooperation and coordination 
between Jordan and fraternal Syria to overcome this serious, 
decisive stage of the peace talks, the new Jordanian position to 
resume the Jordanian-Israeli negotiations in Washington came as 
a destructive turning point for the Arab position in its 
stronger Damascus-Amman-Beirut front. 
  The statement went on: Our Jordanian people were surprised 
by this serious turning point which was peddled by diverting the 
attention of the people by what preceded the recent cabinet 
reshuffle and the statements about more coordination and 
cohesion between Syria and Jordan. The Jordanian officials 
themselves said that coordination enhances the Arab negotiating 
position to a level that can force the occupiers to submit to 
the resolutions of international legitimacy by withdrawing from 
all the occupied Arab territories. 
  The statement added that the new position of the Jordanian 
government, whose head had led the negotiations before he 
assumed the premiership, constitutes an imminent danger to 
Jordan and the Palestinian cause and is an offense to the 
requirements of coordination and cooperation between the Arab 
brothers in Syria and Lebanon. 
  It added that all that Syria is facing is on account of its 
adherence to Arab rights, embodied in the constant principles of 
the nation, noting that Syria is standing like a solid wall in 
the face of all international pressures and Arab deviations. 
  The statement concluded: The new policy of the Jordanian 
government will lead us to an inevitable national disaster. 
Jordan -- land and people -- does not stand to gain from 
turning its back on its brothers. Its interest lies in 
harmonizing its steps and policies with the steps of its Arab 
brothers. 
  Tujan Faysal, member of the Jordanian House of 
Representatives, said the Jordanian government has shown 
reservations over the question of comprehensive coordination 
among Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. 
  In an interview with the Lebanese newspaper AL-HAYAH, the 
Jordanian deputy added: I am against this position. I believe 
that if I am looking for solutions to the economic problems, 
then I should coordinate my cooperation with any Arab party so 
that we can achieve what is better and more useful for both of 
us. 
  Answering another question, Deputy Tujan Faysal said the 
opposition deputies at the Jordanian parliament have felt that 
the Jordanian government opposes Syrian proposals because it 
thinks these proposals aim at something wider than what we want. 
  Mrs. Tujan asked: Is this reasonable and logical? How can 
it be in our interest to coordinate with Israel and the PLO 
leadership and ignore coordination with the Arabs, such as Syria 
and Lebanon? 
  Answering another question, Mrs. Tujan said: The popular 
forces that stood with Iraq during the Gulf war today want to 
coordinate with Syria. This stems from our feeling that we are 
facing a common enemy and that Syria still refuses to make 
concessions to this enemy. So is it in our interest to leave 
Syria and adopt a unilateral stance in the face of this enemy? 
  She added: If we cite the pretext that we are doing this 
because we are a small, weak nation and our economy is suffering 
from difficulties, then we can reply to this by saying that it 
is in our interest to cooperate and coordinate more closely with 
Syria, since it is a big country that has a strong economy. 
This will be more secure for us than dealing with Israel, which 
only thinks about how to swallow us and devour our rights after 
dealing with us individually. 
  She added: The Jordanian people demand coordination with 
Syria while the government insists on heading west toward 
Israel. It was no coincidence that the Jordanian information 
minister's statements about the details of the agreement with 
Israel came in the wake of increasing promises that the people 
will see economic boom and prosperity.

  [Text] In the Kashmir Valley, a well-known scholar and 
mirwaiz [religious leader] of south Kashmir, Qazi Nissar Ahmad, 
has been shot dead by militants. His body was found at Dayalgam 
in Anantnag District this morning. Qazi Nissar Ahmad was 
kidnapped from his residence last evening. One of the killers 
has been identified as Fayaz Ahmad Mir, alias Abu Bakr, who 
according to official sources belongs to the militant outfit 
Hizbul Mojahedin. 
  Over 50,000 people took out a procession in Anantnag town in 
protest against the killing and demanded immediate arrest of the 
killers. The funeral procession raised anti-Hizbul Mojahedin 
and anti-Pakistan slogans. 
  The prime minister has expressed shock and grief at the 
tragic death of Qazi Nissar. Condemning the killing, the state 
governor, General K.V. Krishna Rao, said it clearly indicates 
that the militants have no respect for religion or human rights. 
The BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] and the CPI-M [Communist Party 
of India-Marxist] have also condemned the killing. The BJP 
general secretary, Mr. K.L. Sharma, asked the government to take 
firm measures against the militants, while the CPI-M said it 
showed that the struggle in the Kashmir valley is not on 
communal lines, but between the patriotic and antinational 
forces. 
  Four left parties and the Janata Dal have called for revival 
of the political process in Jammu and Kashmir. In a joint 
statement in New Delhi, the CPI-M, CPI [Communist Party of 
India], Forward Bloc, RSP [Revolutionary Socialist Party], and 
the Janata Dal urged the center to deal firmly with militancy in 
the valley and districts like Doda. They alleged that the BJP 
has chosen to utilize the current events in the state to deepen 
the communal polarization. The union civil aviation minister, 
Mr. Ghulam Nabi Azad, has said the migrants in the Doda District 
in Jammu and Kashmir are likely to return home very soon. He 
was speaking to newsmen after a two-day tour of the bordering 
villages in Himachal Pradesh.

  [Text] In the Kashmir Valley, a near total bundh [strike] 
is being observed today as a mark of protest against the killing 
by militants of the religious scholar and mirwaiz [religious 
leader] of South Kashmir, Dr. Qazi Nissar Ahmad. Shops and 
business establishments are closed and traffic is off the roads. 
In Anantnag, thousands of people are visiting the idgah [place 
of worship] to pay their last homage to Dr. Qazi Nissar Ahmad. 
Dr. Ahmad's body was brought there this morning for burial in 
the afternoon. Spontaneous protest demonstrations by people 
against militants of the Hizbul Mojahedin and their mentors in 
Pakistan have been held at several places in the Kashmir valley 
since yesterday. About one lakh persons participated in Qazi 
Nissar's funeral procession from Dayalgam to Anantnag yesterday. 
  In Srinagar, a building of school run by the Jamaat-i-Islami 
was burnt down by an irate mob yesterday. Reports say the 
militants of the Hizbul Mojahedin and workers of Jamaat-i-Islami 
have fled from their homes in several areas fearing the people's 
wrath. The police have identified one of the killers of Dr. 
Qazi Nissar Ahmad as a self-styled platoon commander of the 
militant outfit. 
  The Indian Union Muslim League [IUML] has asked the union 
government to take urgent steps to apprehend the culprits behind 
Dr. Nissar Ahmad's killing. In a statement in Trivandrum, the 
IUML secretary, Mr. E. Ahmad, MP, deplored the killing.

  This runs counter to inferences of nuclear experts of the 
West, who have claimed that India may have anything from 6 to 20 
weapons. In fact, the general belief that India is only "days or 
weeks away from fabricating a nuclear weapon" also appears to be 
false. 
  While it is likely that India does have a stockpile of 
weapons material in the form of plutonium (Pu-239) -- western 
analysts give a figure of about 200-300 kg -- India is far away 
from being able to put together an efficient and deliverable 
weapon at short notice. If this is indeed true, the likelihood 
of which is high, the bubble of India's nuclear ambiguity stands 
completely blown. In short, India is `nuclear naked'. 
  In this context, the Prime Minister, Mr P V Narasimha Rao's 
statement in his concluding address at the Delhi session of the 
All India Congress Committee (AICC) on Saturday, that India will 
keep its nuclear option open as long as there is universal 
nuclear disarmament, begs the following question. 
  Can India exercise the nuclear option if it wants to at a 
short notice? The nuclear test by China on Friday is only 
likely to heighten the demands of the likes of the BJP 
[Bharatiya Janata Party] that India should go nuclear forthwith. 
Mr L K Advani has reiterated his call at the Baroda session of 
the BJP's national council meeting. 
  The bare critical mass required to sustain an explosive 
chain 
reaction in a bomb configuration, a sphere of weapons grade 
plutonium (which has about 6 per cent Pu-240 in addition to 
Pu-239), is about 15-17 kg of Pu-240, a weapons poison because 
it spontaneously emits neutrons, causing the bomb to 
"pre-detonate" or fizzle out. Reactor-grade material, however, 
contains about 20 per cent Pu-240. 
  Therefore, usually, plutonium from research reactors, where 
material can be drawn before the higher isotopes, like Pu-240, 
form over time in the core, is used for weapons purposes. 
  To maximise the explosive yield of a weapon, bare material 
is 
never used. The fissile core in a weapon is surrounded by a 
thick blanket of a reflector material, which scatters the 
neutrons emitted during fission back into the core so that they 
are not lost out into the environment but cause more number of 
plutonium atoms to fission and increase the energy yield. 
  A suitable reflector material is that which scatters 
neutrons 
much more than it absorbs them and, at the same time, is light 
so that it does not add greatly to the weight of the weapon. 
Beryllium metal (density 1.85 gm/cc) fits the bill admirably. 
So, all nuclear weapon designs incorporate a thick beryllium 
shell around the weapon core. 
  For an efficient weapon, and not a crude "fizzle" variety, a 
beryllium (Be) reflector is a necessity. With a Be reflector, 
the critical mass comes down to about 4.5-5 kg. 
  Data on Be production in the country over the years, and its 
off- take by the department of atomic energy (DAE), has been 
recently given by this year's report of the Comptroller and 
Auditor General (CAG) on scientific departments. 
  It is from this that one is able to conclude that no proper 
weapon could have been fabricated in all these years after the 
Pokharan experiment in 1974. That is, to know whether the 
emperor who is not seen in public has clothes or not, you look 
at the royal tailors' orders. 
  The Pokharan device perhaps used Be imported long ago 
because, at that time, the country had no beryllium production 
facility. Establishing such a facility became essential for 
various strategic needs of the country in the areas of defence 
(for light weight components), space (for light weight gyros), 
atomic energy (for various nuclear applications) and electronics 
(in the form of copper beryllium alloy products), because export 
of beryllium has been embargoed since then by the key Beryllium 
producing countries of the world. 
  Fortunately, India has one of the largest deposits of 
beryllium ore in the world and the idea of such a facility was a 
feasible one. 
  Based on feasibility studies done by the DAE in 1977, a 
beryllium pilot plant (BPP), with a facility for producing 
vacuum hot pressed (VHP) blocks was commissioned in the year 
1982 in Vashi near Bombay. 
  Its originally envisaged annual capacity was 250 kg of VHP 
blocks and 10 tonne of copper-beryllium (Cu-Be) alloy (for 
electronics applications). Later, this was revised to 200 kg of 
metal and 8 tonnes of Cu-Be. 
  An memorandum of understanding signed among the DAE and its 
principal users, namely, the department of space (DoS) and the 
department of electronics (DoE), required that the DAE would set 
up the plant and operate it while the DOS and the DOE would 
share the capital costs and running expenses according to a 
formula. 
  As per this MoU, the DoE would lift the entire produce of 
Cu-Be and 50 per cent of Be metal while the other 50 per cent 
would be lifted by the DoS. 
  Herein lies the curious element. If there had been a post- 
Pokharan policy to produce weapons, the DAE would have been 
slated to lift a certain fraction of the Be produced, but it was 
not. Indeed, according DoS sources, after the plant was 
commissioned, the DAE seemed to have lost its interest in 
beryllium. There is only one interpretation for this. That the 
DAE did not need the metal for want of a directive from the 
government on the weapons front. 
  Further, even though, according to the DAE, technical and 
operational viability of the plant had been demonstrated by 
continuous production and supply, the total quantity of metal 
and alloy produced from 1982 to 1993 was 5.87 per cent and 5.33 
per cent, respectively, of the envisaged capacities. The cost 
of production was also very high. 
  The CAG has given figures of production and off-take for a 
11- year period from 1982. Of a total installed capacity for 
this period of 2,200 kg of Be metal, only 129.17 kg had been 
produced. Of this, the DoS lifted a total of 101.43 kg while the 
DAE lifted only 10.05 kg. The total stock of Be in balance in 
BPP, till 1993, was 17.69 kg. 
  During 1982-89, as per the MoU, DAE's off-take was supposed 
to be zero. But, when in 1989 the DoE pulled out of the MoU for 
envisaged electronics demand for Be not materialising, the DAE 
lifted 8.04 kg. During 1989-93, however, DAE's requirement was 
projected at 12.63 kg but it has finally lifted only 2.01 kg, 
thus totalling its off-take over 11 years to 10.05 kg. 
  The other important use of Be is in its use as 
beryllium-oxide blocks in research reactors like Purnima-I, II 
and III. The metal is also used in the fabrication of neutron 
sources for nuclear research and technology. 
  The DAE, in recent years, has started fabricating such 
sources and a substantial amount of Be metal is likely to be 
used there. Even 10.05 kg is not sufficient material for one 
weapon. So, if we account for all these uses, fabricating a 
deliverable weapon with what would be left with the DAE out of 
the 10.05 kg is out of the question. 
  A rough estimate for the amount of Be required, even for a 
not too good a reflector, for a critical mass of, say, 8 kg of 
plutonium would be about 20 kg in the least. Even if the DAE 
commandeers all the stocks of Be that is in the plant's stocks, 
it may be just enough for fabricating one efficient weapon. 
  So, the scenario that the above analysis indicates is that 
there is no bomb in the Indian basement, unless, of course, the 
figures of production provided to the CAG are not the actual 
ones. 
  Whether this policy of nuclear restraint in the 
post-Pokharan 
phase is deliberate or is willy-nilly a result of inefficient 
beryllium production at BPP, only the DAE knows.

  [Text] Fresh trade worth $20 million has been contracted 
between India and China during the current visit of the Chinese 
minister for foreign trade and economic cooperation, Ms Wu Yi, 
to India. 
  This was disclosed by Ms Wu while addressing a meeting 
organised jointly by the Federation of Indian Chambers of 
Commerce and Industry (Ficci) and the Associated Chambers of 
Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham) under the aegis of the 
Joint Business Council (JBC) here on Wednesday. 
  The trade contract envisages an import of $5 million worth 
of 
raw silk and $7.5 million worth of pig iron from China and an 
export of $7.5 million worth of iron ore to China, she said. 
  She said the Indian government and China were striving for a 
direct trade link to do away with the intermediaries. She said 
both the governments were already seized of the issue. 
  Exuding optimism about the two-way trade and economic 
cooperation between the two countries, she said there would be 
more exchange of business delegations and also economic 
cooperation in areas like science and technology between the two 
countries. 
  Later, addressing a press conference, she said the Chinese 
government was very strict about anti-dumping regulations, and 
said penal legislation would be brought out shortly for those 
exporters who were indulging in export of products at 
artificially low prices, and also indicated that the 
international trade licence of these exporters would be 
cancelled if warnings on dumping are not heeded. 
  Earlier, at a meeting between Chinese businessmen and 
members 
of Ficci and Assocham, a senior official of the external affairs 
ministry disclosed that a double taxation avoidance treaty would 
be signed shortly between the two countries. 
  Other steps being taken to establish direct trade links 
between the two include setting up of bank branches in each 
others' country to circumvent the problems being faced in 
opening letters of credits and establishing direct shipping 
lines and air services. 
  Officials of the external affairs ministry present during 
the 
meeting informed that the Reserve Bank of India and the Peoples 
Bank of China would shortly sign an agreement for setting up 
branches in each others' country. They said the State Bank of 
India was ready to set up a branch in Shanghai soon. 
  In his address, the Assocham president, Mr G H Singhania, 
said that taking advantage of the recent spurt in Sino-Indian 
bilateral trade, which presently hovered around $600 million, 
the JBC should set a target of $3 billion in the next three 
years.

  [Excerpts] Finance Minister Ahmad Husayn has said that the 
noble gesture of leader President Saddam Husayn, may God 
preserve him, to improve the state employees' standard of living 
is part of a series of noble gestures with which the leader of 
the people and inciter of their potential has accustomed us. 
[passage omitted] 
  He explained: To let figures speak for themselves, this 
noble gesture, at its minimum, will grant the bachelor state 
employee 450 dinars per month if he works in Baghdad or the 
provincial capitals, and 550 dinars if he works outside Baghdad 
and the provincial capitals. At its maximum, this gesture will 
provide a married state employee with five children an income 
increase of 750 dinars if he works in Baghdad or the provincial 
capitals, and 850 dinars if he works outside Baghdad and the 
provincial capitals. Between these two limits, the income 
increases for those covered by the noble gesture depends on the 
number of dependent children. 
  The minister noted: If we take into consideration the nature 
of the Iraqi family, which is often an extended family, this may 
result in having more than one family member covered by the 
gesture. Supposing that a family consists of a husband, a wife, 
and three children all of whom are state employees covered by 
the leader president's gesture, this family will have a monthly 
income increase of 2,300 dinars if they work in Baghdad or the 
provincial capitals, and 2,800 dinars if they work outside 
Baghdad and the provincial capitals. [passage omitted] 
  The finance minister explained that the leader president's 
generous gesture will add to the state treasury a monthly 
financial obligation of 1.25 billion dinars, or an annual 
obligation of 15 billion dinars. Therefore, he noted, this 
gesture expresses the leader president's determination to 
achieve prosperity and happiness for the people under the 
existing hard economic circumstances. Naturally, he added, in 
view of their absolute confidence in the leader president's 
command of the march of jihad and reconstruction under the 
blockade and in his generous gestures which aim at improving the 
general living standards of the entire population, those covered 
by the gesture should rise to national responsibility and 
improve their performance in all fields of work. They should 
double their efforts to increase production and provide the best 
services for citizens to ease the burdens of the unfair blockade.

Husayn's statements regarding his hopes to meet publicly with 
Israeli leaders in the near future. In a speech before the 
United Jewish Appeal in Jerusalem, the foreign minister said 
that the differences between Jordan and Israel were not of the 
kind that could not be resolved quickly. 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0830 GMT on 21 June reports 
that "Foreign Minister Peres said that Jordan would have to 
sever its linkage with Syria in the negotiations with Israel. 
This linkage was damaging to both parties, he noted."] 
  As for Yasir 'Arafat's impending visit to the territories, 
Foreign Minister Peres said that it was up to the PLO chairman 
to decide the date of his visit, noting that 'Arafat could 
arrive whenever he chose. This was reported by our 
correspondent Steve Linde.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says the gap between 
the positions of Israel and Syria is very large. But, speaking 
to reporters at an army camp on the Golan Heights this morning, 
Rabin called on Damascus to open direct, high-level negotiations 
with Israel. 
  [Begin recording] [Rabin] The time has arrived that Syria 
will start to realize that the best way to negotiate peace with 
Israel is to sit face to face on higher levels than it was done 
till now, and to talk in a serious way how to reach peace 
between our two countries. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] When do you expect the peace 
talks to resume with Syria face to face? 
  [Rabin] As you know, at this stage it is conducted through 
the visits of the secretary of state. We are ready to continue 
in the way that the United States serves as go-between, 
hopefully to create a basis that will bring about meetings on 
higher levels between Syria and Israel. I cannot see how a real 
agreement or peace treaty can be reached without a certain stage 
of meetings on the higher levels than it is today. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Rabin, Mr. Christopher is not coming to 
the Middle East at this time. What could bring the sides back 
to the table? 
  [Rabin] I cannot speak in the name of the secretary of state 
but I believe that he will come. If it is not going to happen 
in June, it will happen in July. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Hagay Huberman] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has pushed the peace 
issue down low in his order of priorities and he is now focusing 
much more on social issues, a senior government official close 
to the prime minister told HATZOFE. 
  That is why the prime minister decided to put himself in 
charge of the small team negotiating with Ramon's Ram faction in 
the Histadrut, together with 'Uzi Bar'am and Hayim Haberfeld. 
  According to the same source, Rabin feels that by evacuating 
the Gaza Strip -- which in practice is not in our hands despite 
the erroneous "autonomy" title -- he has won the most points he 
can gain in public support on that issue -- and he must now slow 
down on peace if he does not want to lose the "points" he has 
won. 
  "Rabin is starting to tire of the exhausting negotiations 
with the PLO and has decided at this stage to hold up the 
process until the situation in Jericho and Gaza stabilizes. 
Rabin's current agenda is devoted to dealing with issues like 
the Histadrut and its sick fund; the economic situation; the 
cost-of-living index; housing, and other social issues." 
  According to the same source, Rabin apparently fears that 
poor handling of those issues will lose the next elections for 
Labor even if he can point to political successes, therefore his 
day is mainly devoted to social issues. The Prime Minister's 
Office feels that due to 'Arafat's pronouncements, public 
support for an ongoing political move, including the transfer of 
all the areas of Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip to the 
Palestinians, is much lower than for leaving the Gaza Strip, 
which most Israelis, even those identified with the right wing, 
supported.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has acknowledged it 
was Israel's objection that led senior PLO official Nabil Sha'th 
to put off his visit to Jerusalem. Appearing before the Knesset 
Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, Peres said Israel would 
not negotiate with the Palestinians on the next stage until it 
was sure that the Gaza-Jericho arrangement is working. As David 
Ze'ev reports from the Knesset, the meeting was dominated by a 
bitter verbal clash between the foreign minister and the Likud's 
Beni Begin. 
  [Begin recording] [Ze'ev] The talk at the Foreign Affairs 
and Defense Committee was not infighting within Labor, but a 
bitter confrontation between Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and 
Likud committee member Beni Begin. On the heels of the recent 
disclosure of the letter written by the foreign minister on 
Palestinian rights in East Jerusalem, Begin said it was not the 
only time Peres had hidden the facts, and the Likud Knesset 
member accused the foreign minister of purposely deceiving the 
Knesset. Peres retorted: First you carry out terrorism in the 
Knesset plenum, now you want to do it in the committee. Begin 
called Peres a big talker. Peres later called Begin a 
professional slanderer. And so the personal insults went on and 
on. A Knesset official at the closed meeting who relayed the 
dialogue said most committee members were in a state of shock 
and that Foreign Minister Peres commented at the end of the 
meeting that he was shocked, saying this kind of meeting is 
unprecedented. 
  On more mundane affairs, Peres acknowledged to reporters 
later that Israel's objection was the reason senior PLO official 
Nabil Sha'th was not visiting Jerusalem though Peres would not 
elaborate on whether Israel would stop Chairman Yasir 'Arafat 
from coming to the city. 
  [Peres] I am content with the decision of Nabil Sha'th. We 
were not approached by 'Arafat, so there is no need to take any 
steps. 
  [Ze'ev] Peres confirmed that Israel wants to ensure that the 
Gaza-Jericho arrangement with the Palestinians is working first 
before negotiations start on the next stage. On Syria, the 
foreign minister said the delay of the trip to the region by 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher did not mean that the 
negotiations have stopped or failed. 
  [Peres] I think that the secretary feels that he should have 
more meat in his basket from the Syrian side before he makes the 
next move, so it takes another few weeks, but by no means can 
one conclude that the negotiations have stopped or failed. 
  [Ze'ev] They go on, he said. In every negotiation you have 
the ups and downs, and even interruptions. [end recording]

  [Text] Israel will permit the Palestinian policemen who 
are slated to serve on the Allenby Bridge and at the Rafah 
border terminals to assume their posts as early as next week if 
they are prepared. Major General Dani Rothschild, the 
coordinator of activities in the territories, made this 
statement this morning during a visit to the Allenby Bridge. 
Rothschild's deputy Arye Ramot clarified, however, that 
several more weeks are necessary for to complete the technical 
arrangements for the joint work with the Palestinian 
representatives at the border terminals. Among other things 
involved is the installation of sophisticated electronic 
equipment to examine travelers' luggage. This work will be 
completed in mid-July. 
  Our correspondent Ron Nesi'el notes that today, 
Transportation Minister Yisra'el Qeysar visited the Allenby 
Bridge, which will be transferred to the jurisdiction of the 
Israel Airports Authority in approximately four months. Qeysar 
announced that his ministry will invest approximately 30 million 
shekels in the Allenby and Rafah terminals in order to make them 
more modern and efficient. 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1000 GMT on 20 June carries 
a report by Avi Lifshitz on Qeysar's visit to the Allenby 
Bridge, adding that "Minister Qeysar said Jordan wants Israel to 
allow its planes to fly across Israeli airspace to Europe. 
Minister Qeysar said that as soon as such an official request 
arrives, Israel will give it favorable consideration and will 
probably accept it."]

  [Text] Israel is willing to release Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] leader Ahmad Yasin from prison if he signs 
the standard statement saying that he knows that he is being 
released in the framework of the Israel-PLO agreement and that 
he undertakes to refrain from any acts of terrorism. The 
paralyzed and blind Yasin, however, refuses to sign this 
statement and will consequently remain incarcerated in Israel. 
Our military affairs correspondent Yariv Ben-Yehuda reports: 
  [Begin Ben-Yehuda recording] The issue of Hamas leader 
Shaykh Ahmad Yasin's release was reviewed once more several 
weeks ago, and again it was decided not to release him. Israel 
is making Yasin's release conditional on his signing the 
statement all released Palestinian prisoners must sign on 
refraining from acts of or support for terrorism. This was 
divulged by a security source. So far, Yasin has refused to 
sign such a statement. Several Palestinian elements, some of 
them official, recently submitted requests for the release of 
Yasin, who has been imprisoned in Israel since 1988. All the 
requests were reviewed, but as long as Yasin refuses to sign the 
statement, he will remain imprisoned. The security source said 
Israel does not want Yasin to die in an Israeli prison, because 
this could have an impact on Hamas activity and could result in 
a wave of violence by other organizations as well. The state of 
Yasin's health, however, has not changed. As a result of a 
childhood disease, he is paralyzed throughout almost all of his 
body, but there has been no serious deterioration in his 
condition. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Uri Lubrani, the coordinator of </F>
government activities in Lebanon, by Ya'el Dan and Ya'aqov Eylon 
on 21 June; place not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Dan] Earlier this morning, we spoke with Uri 
Lubrani, the coordinator of government activities in Lebanon. 
In our first question we noted that ever since Mustafa 
al-Dirani's abduction [on 21 May], tension and anxiety have 
prevailed throughout Israel's northern settlements. Despite 
fear of a Hizballah retaliation or terrorist attack, things had 
been relatively quiet. We asked Lubrani whether yesterday's 
attack was the reprisal everyone had feared. 
  [Lubrani] I think this operation should be viewed as part of 
our ongoing struggle in the security zone. The IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] soldiers often travel in convoys. Although this 
was an especially serious attack it definitely falls within the 
framework of regular occurrences. Regrettably, however, we paid 
a heavy price this time. 
  [Eylon] How would you define this routine, Mr. Lubrani? 
Prime Minister Rabin also said yesterday that there had been no 
exacerbation along the northern border. What are the parameters? 
  [Lubrani] There are no clear lines. Sometimes, there is a 
steep rise in activity while other periods are more quiet. As 
you just mentioned, we recently experienced a quiet period but 
nothing lasts forever, there is constant activity and something 
happens every night. Some incidents are so low-level that they 
are not worth reporting, but something happens every night. 
  [Dan] Does such a painful attack demand a retaliation on our 
part? 
  [Lubrani] That is something else entirely which involves 
considerations unrelated to the scope of yesterday's incident. 
One must definitely consider taking steps following such an 
attack. However, as I said earlier such convoys are commonplace 
and often exposed to attack. This could happen again today. To 
my regret, this particular attack must be seen within the 
context of daily activity. 
  [Dan] It appears that by using the somewhat outdated sagger 
missiles, the terrorists save themselves the trouble of 
confronting our soldiers head on. Do we have a suitable riposte 
for these missiles? 
  [Lubrani] We have responded by changing our tactics in the 
north; however, the sagger missiles undoubtedly constitute a 
deadly weapon. 
  [Dan] Mr. Lubrani, will we have to accept this kind of 
status quo in the near future? 
  [Lubrani] Yes, that is my impression. It is part of our 
continuing struggle until conditions are ripe for reaching 
security arrangements with Lebanon. 
  [Dan] Thank you, Uri Lubrani.

lift its arms embargo against South Africa. This follows the 
United Nations Security Council's resolution last month to 
cancel the military embargo and other restrictions it had 
imposed in the past. There had been speculation that the two 
countries were cooperating on nuclear weapons and ballistic 
missile research until Israel stopped signing arms contracts 
with South Africa in 1987.

<F P=106> [Interview with Shim'on Sheves, director general of the </F>
Prime Minister's Office, by Dalya Shehori; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] [Shehori] People say you tried to fashion the 
prime minister's bureau after the White House team model. 
  [Sheves] I would not call it "the White House team model," 
but I have definitely been trying to create a structure that 
will fit the direct election of the prime minister and the modus 
operandi of a prime minister elected in such elections. I have 
learned a lot from my meetings, talks, and friendships with 
people in the White House and the State Department. Once a year 
I meet U.S. administration officials, and next month I will be 
meeting the President's advisers and State Department officials. 
What I am particularly interested in learning from them is how 
to implement the platform the President presented in the 
election campaign. 
  [Shehori] Some structures have not been successful, such as 
the follow-up team which collapsed. 
  [Sheves] Not only did it not collapse, but it became 
stronger and its standing with the government ministries is 
steadfast. It consists of two branches: One follows up on the 
prime minister's decisions, which means working with the 
ministries on preeminent issues, such as monitoring the 
budgetary expenditures of each ministry. This work is done by 
one person, who once a month submits a report to the prime 
minister on the activities of all the ministries. A second team 
monitors how budgets are spent on interministerial activities. 
All in all we are talking about four employees. The second 
branch deals with the implementation of administrative decisions 
and the removal of red tape on issues such as road paving, 
construction, housing, land marketing, and the use of budgets in 
the Arab, Bedouin, and Druze sectors. There is yet another 
team, the national projects team headed by Yehezqel Har- Melekh, 
which deals with the transfer of industrial plants from the 
center of the country to development areas, the reclassification 
of settlement areas, and localized treatment of problematic 
areas. 
  [Shehori] Is your goal to make the Prime Minister's Office a 
super ministry? 
  [Sheves] I have never talked about a super ministry, but 
about an office liaising between all the government ministries. 
One of my sorriest conclusions is that the government 
ministries are a confederation of offices which require 
coordination on almost every subject. 
  [Shehori] Do you enjoy the full cooperation of all the 
ministries? 
  [Sheves] Most of them. From the Finance Ministry I only get 
partial cooperation. 
  [Shehori] Why? 
  [Sheves] Because the finance minister and I have different 
personalities and we have different views about many issues. 
  [Shehori] If there is one common denominator to the 
departure of several officials from the prime minister's bureau, 
this seems to be their frustration over the compartmentalization 
and the lack of access to sources of information. 
  [Sheves] Give me one example. 
  [Shehori] Elyaqim Rubinstein, who was not let in on the Oslo 
process. 
  [Sheves] So what? He was not the only one who did not know. 
Many cabinet ministers did not know either. Rabin and Peres 
wanted only a minimum number of people to know the details so 
that the negotiations could end successfully. I think it was 
the right decision. 
  Gad Ben-Ari did a good job and for the most part people were 
satisfied with it. After two years he decided to move to 
another job -- head of the Jewish Agency delegation in the 
United States -- which suited him and his family better. Eli 
Rubinstein sees his future in the legal field and decided to 
pursue a purely legal career as the legal adviser of the defense 
establishment, but at the same time he continues to head the 
delegation to the talks with Jordan and is doing an excellent 
political job. Jacques Neriya reached the conclusion that it 
would be best for him, both financially and in terms of 
promoting his personal career, if he became the head of the 
Histadrut labor federation's international affairs department. 
His was one of the most successful appointments in this office 
in the last two years. 
  [Shehori] Are there plans to fill the job left vacant by 
Hayim Asad as strategic adviser to the prime minister? 
  [Sheves] No. He had also been supposed to head the national 
security team, but this did not come about. He never dealt with 
this issue. His is the only appointment I feel was a failure. 
Hayim Asad was not the right man for the job, neither in terms 
of his qualifications nor on the personal level. 
  [Shehori] You have had confrontations with Ministers Ya'aqov 
Tzur, Avraham "Beiga" Shohat, and Binyamin "Fu'ad" Ben-Eli'ezer. 
  [Sheves] I have had no confrontations with Tzur and Fu'ad. 
Tzur promised to appoint a friend of ours, Bentzi Weiner, as 
director general of the Agriculture Ministry but he did not keep 
his promise. Tzur does not deny that he made such a promise, 
and I am no longer angry with him. I got angry in the way 
friends do, but our dispute ended in September 1992. We work 
closely together. 
  With Fu'ad I have had two professional, not personal, 
arguments. One was two years ago over the issue of highways and 
junctions and it all ended well, in a friendly and 
matter-of-fact manner. Our second argument was over the fact 
that I submitted a serious, authoritative, responsible, and 
learned study about the rise in the price of apartments in 
Israel in the past six months. He did not appreciate this fact 
very much, and I understand him. At the same time, there is 
cooperation between us and together we worked out the draft 
resolution submitted to the cabinet. As for Beiga Shohat, the 
issue runs much deeper. I have a serious argument with him 
about priorities. I greatly appreciate the macro achievements 
in the Israeli economy. The problem is with the micro-strategic 
issues, such as tackling the problem of housing in a timely and 
firm manner. 
  [Shehori] Did you expect the prime minister to appoint you 
as a minister when Ramon quit? 
  [Sheves] I did not expect it and I do not think he could. 
  [Shehori] You had expectations in the political sphere, but 
in the end you have been left out of it. 
  [Sheves] I have not been neutralized at all in the political 
sphere, the prime minister includes me in everything. I do not 
play a functional role in the negotiations because I am not a 
member of any delegation. I have never wanted to be a member or 
head of any delegation. I know I am not qualified for such a 
job because I have no experience in this field and this is a 
very professional area. However, I have assisted and I continue 
to assist on many issues in the political sphere. 
  [Shehori] What are your aspirations? 
  [Sheves] I will not run in the primaries, I have no plans to 
be a politician, I do not want to be either a member of the 
Knesset or a cabinet minister. I want to serve Rabin as 
director general of the Prime Minister's Office and to be 
successful in my job. I will take it from here; I do not plan 
anything in advance. I never planned to be the director general 
of the Prime Minister's Office.

<F P=106> [Article by Dalya Shehori: "I Like Being Director General; </F>
I Want To Serve Rabin"] 
  [Text] As far as Shim'on Sheves is concerned, he is 
realizing the dreams and plans he brought to the prime 
minister's bureau when he became its director general, and he is 
pleased with a job well done. Others -- ministers and public 
figures who maintain close ties with the prime minister's bureau 
-- paint a different picture. Sheves established a team to 
monitor the implementation of the prime minister's and 
government's decisions, including the way budgets are used by 
the various ministries. According to him, the team has been 
operating, coordinating, and discharging its duties. Others say 
the follow-up team collapsed several months after its 
establishment. There is a considerable disparity between the 
versions. 
  While media descriptions have portrayed Sheves as a very 
strong man, whose proximity to Yitzhaq Rabin has put him in 
control of extensive information and of the fate of ministers 
and officials, it now transpires that ministers who had a 
falling-out with Sheves lost nothing of the access to or good 
ties with Rabin. Agriculture Minister Ya'aqov Tzur, 
Construction and Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer, and 
Finance Minister Avraham Shohat enter the prime minister's 
bureau daily and meet with him whenever necessary. When Shohat 
presented the cabinet the Finance Ministry's plan dealing with 
unemployment, while an alternative plan drafted by strategic 
adviser Hayim Asa -- who has meanwhile been fired -- was 
submitted on behalf of Sheves, the cabinet endorsed Shohat's 
plan. 
  A cabinet minister said off the record: "I do not think he 
is powerful. He did not manage to really harm Beiga [Avraham] 
Shohat, perhaps just to smear him, and even that is too strong 
an expression. The bottom line is that Beiga sees Rabin and 
talks to him, while Sheves has been forced to withdraw his 
ideas. It was very obvious at a housing discussion (where 
Sheves proposed reverting to public construction and greater 
government involvement -- DS)." 
  Officials close to Shohat say the finance minister sees his 
conflict with Sheves and Sheves' ability to harm him as some 
force majeure with which he has to live. Shohat finds solace in 
the fact that Rabin never comes out against him and in the prime 
minister's loyalty to him. 
  A man conversant with affairs at Rabin's bureau says that 
when Sheves arrived there, he had many grand schemes to 
establish a structure similar to that of the White House team, 
with himself at the top. "All doors leading to the bureau were 
repainted, many new signs were put up, a project follow-up team 
was set up, as were other bodies. But Sheves, a pugnacious man 
who suited Rabin's needs in the primaries and the election 
campaign, was unable to take charge of such a complex system. 
Every system he established collapsed, and decent members of 
the bureau staff admitted there was nothing for them to do 
there. What remains today is Rabin's skeleton headquarters: 
Military Secretary Dani Yatom, who liaises with the Mosad and 
the Shin Bet and arranges the prime minister's flights and 
receipt of cables; bureau chief Eytan Haber, who writes the 
prime minister's speeches and is on intimate terms with Rabin. 
Sheves is nonexistent. He still plays a political role, and as 
a man with street savvy, he understands the trends in the 
street, but he does not participate in security and political 
consultations." 
  Time has proven that 42-year-old Sheves often engages in 
power contests, in which he is defeated. In the words of one of 
the ministers: "He draws all his strength from Rabin. If he is 
separated from him, he will not be able to survive." When 
Sheves put his strength to a test by promoting Yuval Frenkel's 
candidacy for Labor party secretary general, the job was won by 
Nisim Zvili. Ya'aqov Tzur refused to accept Sheves' dictums 
regarding appointments, but this never hurt his standing. 
Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer did tell the government that the 
Construction Ministry's housing plan is coordinated with the 
prime minister's bureau, but for Ben-Eli'ezer this was 
apparently a one-time concession. Shohat has not deviated from 
his economic doctrine, and he continues to back Treasury 
officials. 
  It seems that Sheves' tests of power ultimately tarnished 
his image. He once said in a press interview that he must be 
believed when he says that he does not appoint people, but only 
recommends appointments to the prime minister occasionally. 
Then we thought he was acting humble, but today we can believe 
him. 
  The revolution Sheves brought about in the Prime Minister's 
Office and bureau -- cutting down the number of advisers to the 
prime minister; making all other advisers administratively 
subordinate to the director general; creating new departments 
and liaison mechanisms between government ministers; improving 
services to the citizen -- may have been ahead of its time. It 
would have been more suitable for a time when the prime minister 
is chosen in direct elections and his powers resemble those of 
the U.S. President. At the moment, the system does not work 
well, and only a handful of ministers come to the bureau to 
coordinate issues with Sheves. For his part, he concentrates 
his efforts on socioeconomic issues, including the 
reclassification of development areas and localized treatment of 
backward or problematic areas (including in the Arab sector), 
and gets praised for it. 
  Rabin did not interfere with the innovations Sheves made in 
the Prime Minister's Office. He does not need advisers any way, 
and except for substantive issues, what happens in the bureau 
does not interest him. Gradually the bureau began emptying of 
people and goals. Advisers and key officials, such as Cabinet 
Secretary Elyaqim Rubinstein, media adviser Gad Ben-Ari, and 
political adviser Jacques Neriya, quit recently. On the face of 
it, each of them quit for his own reasons. But, according to 
knowledgeable sources, most of these departures could have been 
avoided if these officials had had better access to information. 
They had no problem accessing the prime minister, but 
information in various areas was blocked to them and this 
hindered their work and led to compartmentalization and 
frustration. Haber and Sheves are seen as the guilty party. 
  The prime minister's bureau is having a hard time filling 
the 
vacated jobs. Interviewed by Qol Yisra'el, Sheves said that 
"many people would like to be cabinet secretaries and the prime 
minister's spokesman." He said he was talking about dozens of 
people, "all of them good," and noted that the prime minister 
would soon make up his mind. However, other bureau staffers 
would only say that the job of cabinet secretary became vacated 
on 1 April, that Rubinstein was asked to stay on until May, and 
that no replacement had been found to overlap with him. 
  Although the fact that the prime minister's media adviser 
would be quitting had been known for a few months, Ben-Ari left 
and his job has not yet been filled. One could say that the 
prime minister is the best government spokesman, and that he 
makes statements to the media quite often. However, the job of 
spokesman includes regular contacts with journalists, and while 
Israeli journalists can obtain information from other sources in 
the prime minister's bureau, foreign journalists have nobody to 
turn to. 
  People who know Sheves' working ability praise his 
performance and even his tendency to iron out differences and 
cut corners. "Sheves is a very good can-do man," said Justice 
Minister David Liba'i, the only minister who was prepared to 
speak for the record. "Myself, I have had very little contact 
with him, but his attitude has always been businesslike and 
matter-of-fact." 
  He is regarded as a sharp and intelligent man, but not as a 
methodic and theoretical thinker. People note his integrity and 
his disposition to speak up his mind anywhere, even to Rabin. 
According to various testimonies, Sheves does not recoil from 
confronting Rabin when this is necessary. A person who 
witnessed such a confrontation says that Sheves insisted on his 
position even when Rabin hollered at him. The same person added 
that Rabin hates obsequiousness and appreciates men who stand up 
for their views. 
  People say that with Sheves, a sensitive and direct man, you 
know exactly where you stand and note that he is a good friend. 
Other people, however, say that he can also be crass and rude.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, 'Arafat's political </F>
adviser, by Mahmud Abu-'Ubayd; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Abu-'Ubayd] Dr. Sha'th, what are your 
feelings on the first day of your assuming the duties of your 
post? 
  [Sha'th] I am very happy and optimistic, especially as I see 
a readiness for the building stage in the eyes of my people and 
colleagues, and I hope we will succeed in building our state 
with Jerusalem as its capital. 
  [Abu-'Ubayd] You talk about Jerusalem before you have 
reached it, and Israel continues to make statements confirming 
that the [Palestinian] Authority will not go beyond the 
boundaries of self-rule or reach Jerusalem. Besides, Jerusalem 
is not included in the self-rule budget. 
  [Sha'th] The new authority will develop and reach Jerusalem. 
Israel can say whatever it likes, but the reality of the 
negotiations is another thing. They [Israelis] will not be able 
to impose their will on us. The National Authority's 
institutions are being set up in Gaza and Jericho. But the 
other institutions have to be in Jerusalem. In other words, the 
National Authority's ministries will be based in Gaza and 
Jericho, while the other economic and social institutions will 
be based in Jerusalem. Because Jerusalem is the capital of our 
state. This is the accurate implementation of the agreement, 
which stresses the need to implement it within the framework of 
international Resolution No. 242. 
  I would like also to point out that the new authority will 
devote great attention to Jerusalem, especially with regard to 
its building and reconstruction. Incidentally, this was part of 
the agreement with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which stressed 
its willingness to contribute to bolstering Jerusalem. We will 
do our utmost to build houses, public facilities, and 
institutions in Arab Jerusalem. 
  [Abu-'Ubayd] What is the nature of the financial crisis 
facing the new Palestinian Authority? 
  [Sha'th] There is no crisis now. At the donor states 
meeting in Paris we managed to agree on covering the deficit in 
current expenditures. And we will try to collect taxes to avoid 
an increase in the deficit. We expect to face some difficulties 
in collecting these taxes within the coming four months. This 
is why the donor states will cover this deficit. The donor 
states decided to grant us $42 million in cash, and they have 
indeed given us this sum, which I have brought with me to the 
[Gaza] Strip. [passage omitted] 
  [Abu-'Ubayd] Has the Palestinian position on the Arab 
boycott [of Israel] changed? 
  [Sha'th] We will comply with the economic agreement signed 
with Israel. We will not continue the boycott, by virtue of the 
existence of an economic agreement signed between us and them. 
  However, this agreement does not mean ending the Arab 
boycott. There is nothing to compel the Arab states to import 
from Israel. On the contrary, the economic agreement signed with 
Israel does not allow us to reexport products from Israel. The 
first and second tables in the economic agreement allow us only 
to import what is required to meet local needs. The agreement 
does not allow us to reexport Israeli goods. 
  Relations to be established between the Arab states and 
Israel will not be conducted via the Palestinians. We will not 
be a bridge before a full peace has been achieved, nor will we 
agree to play a broker's role.

  [Text] Nabil Sha'th will not come to East Jerusalem today. 
Qol Yisra'el's reporter, quoting authoritative sources, says he 
will not come because his current work load prevents him from 
doing so. Senior Israeli officials were informed of the PLO 
official's decision. 
  Last night, Sha'th met with several members of the 
Palestinian Authority. A Qol Yisra'el reporter says they 
discussed Sha'th's talks with Deputy Chief of Staff Amnon Shahaq 
on early empowerment and preparations for the upcoming visit of 
Yasir 'Arafat. General Shahaq and Nabil Sha'th are to resume 
negotiations next Monday. 
  Speaking to reporters in Jericho last night, Sha'th outlined 
the main items on the agenda: 
  [Begin Sha'th recording] First item on the negotiations will 
be the continued release of the prisoners and those prisoners 
who are here in Jericho, and the second item, of course, will be 
the immediate negotiations on early empowerment of the full 
spread of the Palestinian Authority and Palestinian police in 
the West Bank, and then, of course, also continuing to finish 
the unfinished matters from the Gaza and Jericho. [end 
recording] 
  Sha'th also explained why he had come to Jericho at this 
stage: 
  [Begin Sha'th recording] I want to make sure that Jericho 
has all the help and support and protection that Gaza now has 
from its Palestinian police and Palestinian Authority, but also 
I am very happy to be here. I have not been here since 1948.

  [Text] This evening Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa met with a 
Yemeni delegation from Sanaa led by 'Ali Mansur Rashid, member 
of the General Committee of the General People's Congress. 
Rashid said that they discussed the developments in Yemen. He 
praised the efforts being made by Egypt and President Husni 
Mubarak to stop the bloodshed in Yemen and to reach a cease-fire. 
  On the failure of the UN envoy's mission, Rashid said that 
the UN envoy had made good efforts and put forward certain 
proposals. Rashid noted that had they been adopted by the United 
Nations and the rest of the Arab countries, they would have 
helped to stop the bloodshed in Yemen and bring about a 
cease-fire. He said that he and the UN envoy discussed quick 
ways to form a military committee, which previously supervised 
the armed forces' movements. He said they also discussed 
expanding the committee by adding certain Arab parties to it. 
  Rashid noted that the fighting in Yemen hinges on the 
continuation of the rebellion against the constitutional 
legitimacy, this group's submission to the legitimacy, and 
ending the rebellion. He said: Despite this, we are ready for a 
cease-fire and will contribute to forming a committee to monitor 
it. 
  Responding to a question that unity cannot be imposed by 
force, Rashid said that the unity was not imposed by force, but 
was established peacefully and democratically, and two 
referendums were held on the unity. He pointed out that what is 
now taking place in Yemen is an attempt to impose secession by 
force and we are defending and safeguarding this unity. He said 
that he asked 'Amr Musa for Egypt to continue its important and 
good role in limiting the Yemeni people's suffering and pain.

  [Text] Mohamed Abdelaziz, secretary general of the 
Polisario Front, held a news conference at the 27 February 
national school, attended by the national and Spanish media 
accompanying a visiting Spanish delegation. 
  The brother president said that the Western Sahara issue is 
an issue of special interest and was the subject of deep concern 
for the presidents of the African states who attended the 30th 
OAU summit. 
  The brother president pointed out that the latest proposal 
put forward by the Polisario Front, calling for the convening of 
an international conference for giving a boost to the UN peace 
plan on Western Sahara, is considered by the organization as a 
constructive initiative and was approved in a report by the OAU 
secretary general. 
  With regard to a question related to Morocco's stance, which 
rejects OAU participation, the brother president said that 
Morocco has constantly used all forms of maneuvering and 
procrastination and today it rejects the OAU participation in 
the identification process and this is a blatant violation of 
the text and spirit of the UN-OAU peace plan based on African 
resolution 104. 
  The brother president added: Through our contacts with the 
various African heads of states, we made a full denunciation of 
the Moroccan stance which calls basically for blowing up the 
UN-OAU peace plan, stipulating the organization of a free, just, 
and unbiased referendum for the Saharan people. He highlighted 
that this Moroccan stance is dangerous and would put Morocco in 
a clear and open conflict with the UN, the OAU and international 
legality. [passage indistinct]. 
  The brother president said that the Saharan people are 
preparing for all possibilities and will continue to give 
serious and full cooperation to the UN and the OAU [passage 
indistinct].

  [Text] Israeli military aircraft launched two air raids on 
Hizballah positions in western al-Biqa' and in the south today, 
but there were no casualties. In the meantime, the resistance 
launched an attack in retaliation. Agent Lahd militia [South 
Lebanese Army] admitted that three Israeli soldiers were killed 
in a resistance attack on an Israeli patrol shortly after the 
Israeli air raid. Sources said that the other Israeli soldiers 
in the patrol were critically wounded and an Israeli personnel 
carrier was destroyed in the attack near al-Shaqif castle. Our 
correspondent in the south 'Ali Dawud reports: 
  [Begin Dawud recording] Israeli artillery bombarded several 
villages in the al-Nabatiyah and Iqlim al-Tuffah areas today, 
injuring two people in Kafr Tibnit, damaging several homes, and 
burning crops. The resistance retaliated by attacking Israeli 
and agent positions in al-Burj, 'Ali al-Tahir, al-Shaqif castle, 
and the al-Khardali bridge road. 
  The Israeli aircraft launched an air raid on Jabal al-Rafi' 
area in Iqlim al-Tuffah at 1455 today, firing two air-to-surface 
missiles. In the meantime, Israeli aircraft flew over 
al-Nabatiyah and Iqlim al-Tuffah. According to eyewitnesses, 
the Israeli military aircraft raided the al-Qatranah area, but 
the Islamic Resistance sources affirmed that the raid targeted 
its positions in al-Luwayzah hills. 
  At 1530, the Israeli forces expanded the scope of their 
aggression, and Israeli artillery in al-Zaffatah bombarded the 
Iqlim al-Tuffah hills and heights, focusing on Mlita, 
al-Luwayzah, and Jabal Safi. The sporadic bombardment continued 
for one hour. At 1545, the Israeli barrage reached the villages 
of Kafr Tibnit, Yuhmur, Arnun, Zawtar al-Gharbiyah, Zawtar 
al-Sharqiyah, the outskirts of al-Nabatiyah al-Fawqa, Shukin, 
and Mayfadun. The bombardment was accompanied by bursts of 
heavy machine-gun fire to these areas. The shelling of Kafr 
Tibnit injured Khadijah Bushr, 66, who was taken to the hospital 
where she succumbed to her wounds. Qasim Siblin was injured in 
his foot and was taken to the government hospital in 
al-Nabatiyah. The bombardment of Kafr Tibnit by incendiary 
shells set fire to the crops, particularly the cornfields. The 
shelling of Kafr Tibnit and the Arnun-Yuhmur highway continued 
at 1700. The Lebanese civil defense teams rushed to fight the 
fires in Kafr Tibnit but were met with difficulties because of 
the sniper fire on the area. The civil defense sources said 
that they sent several fire-fighting vehicles to extinguish the 
fires that had spread to crops. They managed to put out a fire 
in Kafr Tibnit but failed to put out a fire near the Arnun road 
and al-Shaqif castle. These sources said that Lebanese army 
units assisted the civil defense teams and other volunteers in 
the area to extinguish the fires. 
  Tension prevails in the villages in the al-Nabatiyah area 
adjacent to the contacts lines with the occupied border strip. 
Meanwhile Israeli helicopters flew over the area from al-Shaqif 
castle up the al-Burj and 'Ali al-Tahir at 1745 today and raked 
the al-Khardali bridge area. 
  The Islamic Boy Scouts room of operation took part in 
fighting the fires and they sent ambulances to take the wounded 
to the hospitals. They also secured vehicles to move families 
from the eastern part of Kafr Tibnit to al-Nabatiyah and other 
safe areas. 
  The Islamic Resistance issued initial information on several 
operations they launched this afternoon against Israeli and 
agent patrols inside the occupied strip. It said that its 
groups attacked an enemy convoy composed of 30 soldiers on the 
al-Khardali road this afternoon, completely destroying a Reo 
vehicle, a jeep, a personnel carrier, and damaging other 
vehicles. It said that all members of the patrol were killed or 
injured. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Kuwait, 18 Jun (KUNA) -- Admiral Jacques 
Lanxade, the French chief of general staff said today that his 
meetings with Kuwaiti officials focused on looking into means of 
bilateral military cooperation and reviewing the overall 
situation in the Gulf region. 
  In a statement to the Kuwaiti news agency he said: Military 
cooperation between France and Kuwait goes a long time back, we 
now have teams working on helicopters and aircraft. We are also 
in the process of discussing joint projects in connection with 
other aspects of the armed forces. 
  He added that he had discussed with Kuwaiti officials a 
project on patrol boats. These boats are being manufactured by 
a French company that supplies the French Armed Forces with 
boats. Oman also has purchased a number of boats from this 
company. 
  The French admiral, who is on a two-day visit to Kuwait said 
that France is concerned with the security of the Gulf region. 
Admiral Lanxade said: France clearly supports the need for 
Iraq to implement all the UN Security Council resolutions and 
recognize Kuwait's sovereignty. 
  He went on to say that he had told Kuwaiti officials France 
could supply Kuwait with radar equipment and air defense 
rockets. France is making considerable efforts in the field of 
defense because we realize that the world is currently unstable 
and we have a role to play as a permanent member of the UN 
Security Council, he said. 
  Admiral Lanxade added: We have elements working now in Saudi 
Arabia and Turkey to follow up the monitoring of Iraqi air space 
and we took part in the embargo on the Jordanian port of 
al-'Aqabah. 
  He said that the current exercises between the Kuwaitis and 
the French are aimed at stressing that there is military 
cooperation between the two countries. 
  Admiral Lanxade said: These exercises are a message to the 
neighborhood and are a means of developing the operational 
aspects of relations between our forces. They are also a means 
that would enable us to work together if the need rises. 
[passage omitted] 
  Lanxade stressed: The importance of the military deals 
between France and Kuwait are not of mere commercial importance. 
In fact the existence of a joint project between the Armed 
Forces of the two countries provides a real opportunity for 
joint operations, an element that is more important than the 
commercial interests. 
  Regarding the situation in Yemen he said: We believe the 
situation is serious in Yemen and wish for the hostilities to be 
stopped. 
  He added that the French naval forces had evacuated a number 
of people out of Yemen including foreign nationals more than 
French citizens. The Yemeni issue is serious because it affects 
the security of the Arab peninsular, he said. 
  Lanxade said that France had 10 warships opposite Djibouti, 
about 4,000 French troops stationed there, forces in the south 
of the Indian Ocean, and 150 soldiers of the French Air Force in 
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Algeria: Tripartite Committee To </F>
Topple Sifi's Government"] 
  [Text] Algeria -- Reliable Algerian sources have told 
AL-HAYAH that the group of Boubakr Belkaid (former interior 
minister), Selim Saadi (former interior minister), and General 
Mohamed Touati (adviser to the defense minister and member of 
the Dialogue Committee) has been making intensive contacts for 
weeks with the Algerian opposition parties, and circles of 
political movements and societies in Tunisia, Morocco, and 
France to undermine Mokdad Sifi's government, accusing it of 
"political impotence against the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS], 
economic failure against a background of deteriorating social 
conditions, and failure to take a firm stand against terrorism." 
  That group, the sources said, offers itself as an 
alternative 
"to the current political line and is preparing to topple the 
present government." They quoted people close to Sifi's 
government as saying that "behind that move, there are judicial 
files against Selim Saadi who formed a number of companies in 
Tunisia in the names of his relatives when he was agriculture 
minister and then interior minister, as well as large files 
against Boubakr Belkaid and one of his in-laws since Boukaid was 
construction minister, then higher education minister, then 
information minister, and finally interior minister." They 
added that it is not unlikely that "the political activities of 
the trio opposed to dialogue and reconciliation with the 
Islamists are just a reaction to protect their political and 
financial interests." 
  The sources believe that these figures "are trying to use 
the 
card of [the anniversary of] the late President Mohamed Boudiaf 
(former chairman of the Higher State Council) to support Saeed 
Saadi, leader of the Rally for Culture and Democracy, in a move 
to stage a procession on 29 June despite Saadi's denial that he 
was exploiting Boudiaf's assassination anniversary to stage the 
procession." 
  Media sources in Algeria say that Selim Saadi, interior 
minister under Redha Malek, "had seen himself as the successor 
to Ali Kafi (Higher State Council chairman) because of the 
support he was and still is getting from his ally Gen. Mohamed 
Touati and his group. That was clearly evident in the meetings 
Saadi held with local officials in Algerian provinces. It was 
noticed then that he was speaking not in his capacity as 
interior minister but rather more like a head of state, a matter 
which created extreme sensitivity between him and Ali Kafi and 
then between him and the current President Liamine Zeroual who 
dismissed Redha Malek's government because of the attitude of 
Saadi who exceeded his limits to the point of speaking on behalf 
of the military establishment." 
  While the "trio" is planning to topple the government, the 
latter is proceeding with its plan to define its policies, solve 
new problems such as those related to the official certificate 
examinations, and introduce central administrative changes at 
Algiers University and some institutes.

  [Text] Khartoum, 20 Jun (MENA)--Sudanese security forces 
today arrested al-Sadiq al-Mahdi, former prime minister and 
leader of the dissolved Ummah Party, along with a large group of 
prominent members in the Ummah Party on charges of involvement 
in a conspiratorial organization. Sudanese Television said this 
evening that the detainees are: Dr. Hammad 'Umar Baqadi, member 
of the Ummah Party Political Bureau; Brigadier General Ma'ash 
'Abd-al-Rahman Farah, former adviser to the Sudanese security 
department; and Sayf-al-Din Sa'id, member of the secretariat of 
security and information in the Ummah Party. The television 
said that the detention took place after the officials had set 
the hour for the arrests. 
  A security source stated that based on monitored information 
and movements of the detainees, al-Mahdi was arrested after 
investigations proved his complicity in a conspiracy. He 
stressed that the competent agencies would inform the public of 
any new details or developments.

  [Text] Mashhad, June 20, IRNA -- A bomb went off this 
afternoon here in one of the crowded prayer halls in the 
mausoleum of the Imam Reza (as) [peace be upon him], killing and 
injuring tens of people who had gathered there to commemorate 
'Ashura. 
  Over 60 injured people have been transferred to the 
hospitals 
here. Most of the people who have been injured had come from 
different cities all over the country to commemorate the 
anniversary of the martyrdom of the Imam Husayn today which is 
known as 'Ashura. 
  As a rule every year on this day, mourners flock to Imam 
Reza's mausoleum to observe the mourning ceremonies for Imam 
Husayn. 
  Imam Reza is the eighth imam and Imam Husayn is the third 
imam of the infallible household of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) 
[expansion unknown]. Both imams were martyred by the tyrannical 
rulers of their times.

<F P=106> [Report by Murid Hammad in Washington; from the "News at </F>
Ten" program] 
  [Text] His Majesty the king began his official visit to 
Washington with a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher. 
  Today's talks are expected to have covered the Middle East 
peace process, particularly the Jordanian-Israeli track, in 
addition to developments in the Middle East and bilateral ties. 
  [Begin recording] [Christopher] Good morning. I'm very 
honored today to welcome to the State Department King Husayn, 
who is an old friend in so many different ways. We're at an 
important moment, I think, in the history of the Middle East. 
  The recent bilateral discussions here between Israel and 
Jordan, with the participation of the United States, indicate 
that there is room for very real progress in the Middle East, 
and I've congratulated the king on that progress and urged that 
we would do everything we could to try to assist in that 
situation. 
  Jordan has stood for progress in the Middle East peace 
situation and their bilateral track, I think, is one on which 
there are great opportunities for the two countries to work 
together. So, as always, it's a great pleasure to welcome the 
king here. We have many items to discuss -- their defense 
needs, the economic situation in Jordan, the path for 
democratization in Jordan. We have many items on which we have 
common interest, and, of course, many items on which we admire 
the king's leadership. So, Your Majesty, it's a great honor to 
have you here in the State Department. 
  [Husayn] Thank you very much indeed, Mr. Secretary. Thank 
you very very much indeed for your kind words of welcome, and 
I'm very pleased with the opportunity to meet with you today, 
sir, and hopefully in the next two days to meet with the 
President as well, and many of our friends here in Washington. 
  We are indeed optimistic as far as the future is concerned 
in 
our quest for a just, durable, comprehensive peace in the 
region. And we are very happy indeed that on the 
Jordanian-Israeli track we are about to begin to address the 
problems that were a part of the agenda worked out earlier on. 
And beginning with border demarcation, delineation, we hope 
this will take place on the ground there, and we appreciate 
certainly the role of our friends in supporting us and our 
efforts to arrive at this point. [end recording] 
  Today's talks were followed by a working lunch attended by 
the prime minister, the chief of the Royal Court, his majesty's 
political adviser, Prince Talal Bin-Muhammad, minister of state 
for prime ministry affairs, the minister of information, the 
minister of finance, and Jordan's ambassador in Washington. 
  On the U.S. side, it was attended by high-level delegation 
from the Departments of State and Defense, as well as President 
Clinton's national security adviser. 
  Sources from the Jordanian delegation told the News at Ten 
that today's meeting was fruitful and very successful. 
  Later tonight his majesty the king will meet U.S. Secretary 
of Commerce Ron Brown for talks that will center on trade 
relations between the two countries.

  [Text] Vienna, June 18 (INA) -- Iraq's Oil Minister, Dr. 
Safa' Hadi Jawad, has reiterated Iraq's rejection of new 
conditions or changes on the Iraqi-Turkish accord to reoperate 
the Iraqi oil pipeline crossing the Turkish territories for 
cleaning and repairing it. 
  In a press statement here on Friday [17 June], Dr. Jawad 
said 
that this topic was directly pertaining to the Iraqi and Turkish 
sides. Therefore, Turkey should begin implementing the accord 
without taking permission from the Security Council. 
  The minister pointed out that both Iraq and Turkey had 
agreed 
to use the revenues to settle part of Iraq's debts to Turkey and 
the other part to purchase foodstuffs, baby milk and medicine 
from Turkey.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said that during 
yesterday's attack in the security zone, Hizballah fighters 
fired 12 Sagger missiles at an IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
convoy, a missile volley unprecedented in the history of the 
clashes with the Hizballah. The prime minister added that on 
average, five clashes occur every week in south Lebanon; 
however, since these incidents generally result in no casualties 
they are not reported. 
  Prime Minister Rabin said he would be happy to meet Jordan's 
King Husayn and Jordanian officials anytime, anywhere. Our 
political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that the prime 
minister was responding to King Husayn's assertion that the time 
for a public meeting between himself and Israeli leaders was 
drawing near. King Husayn is currently visiting the United 
States and will meet President Clinton on 23 June to discuss the 
promotion of the peace process. 
  [Tel Aviv MA'ARIV in Hebrew on 21 June in a pool report on 
pages 1, 2 notes that "officials at the prime minister's bureau 
yesterday clarified that the exchange of declarations between 
King Husayn and Prime Minister Rabin was not a smokescreen to 
conceal contacts already under way to hold a meeting in the near 
future. Nevertheless, political sources expressed the assessment 
that the declarations may lead to a process similar to the one 
which accompanied Egyptian President al-Sadat's trip to 
Jerusalem in 1977 and resulted in the first public meeting 
between Israeli and Jordanian officials -- including Husayn and 
Rabin -- in the near future. 
  "Meanwhile, political sources in Jerusalem yesterday 
reported 
that Jordan was signalling its readiness to permit limited 
numbers of Israeli tourists to enter Jordan soon." MA'ARIV adds 
that "Officials in Jerusalem yesterday asserted that Jordan had 
not been frightened by Syria's anger over Amman's progress in 
the negotiations with Israel, and apparently intended to 
implement various aspects of normalization with Israel over the 
coming months."] 
  The prime minister met with the Labor Knesset faction 
yesterday and discussed the government's achievements over the 
past two years. At the meeting, the prime minister said that the 
state of calm in the Gaza Strip and the drop in terrorism 
influenced the national mood more than any debate at the Labor 
party's Central Committee. Rabin described the implementation of 
the agreement with the Palestinians as not bad. Commenting on 
the difficulties in the negotiations with the Syrians, the prime 
minister stressed that he was not pessimistic and noted that 
meetings with Jordanian officials would take place next month 
along the border. These political developments, Rabin said, 
calms the security situation. 
  The prime minister asserted that the Labor party's rule 
would 
be judged in three fields: infrastructure, education, and the 
scope of unemployment. As for Hayim Ramon and his associates, 
Yitzhaq Rabin said that it was inconceivable for them to hold 
two passports. Although they were not members of the party they 
remained members of its Knesset faction. At the same time, the 
prime minister was not proposing to expel them from the Knesset 
faction. Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that the 
atmosphere at the meeting was relaxed and many of the faction 
members said that following last week's uproar, the party should 
start putting its house in order. The debate on the party's 
condition was put off until tomorrow.

    [Editorial report] The following is a comprehensive review 
of all items in the 14 June issue of the Arabic-language 
newspaper Cairo AL-SHA'B that pertain to political Islamic 
issues. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Chief Editor on Islamic Awakening In Turkey 
  2. Chief Editor Notes Destruction of Liberties 
  3. Lawyers Moderation, National Unity Underlined 
  4. Writer Views Middle Eastern Market From Islamic 
Standpoint 
  5. Muslim Brotherhood Deputy Guide Preaches Islamic Values 
  6. Columnist Highlights Situation of Muslims in Africa 
<H5>  CHIEF EDITOR ON ISLAMIC AWAKENING IN TURKEY </H5>
  Chief Editor Majdi Ahmad Husayn publishes on page 2 a 
2,500-word article in which he reviews Turkey's history before 
and after Kamal Ataturk and just what led to its secularism. 
The writer then explains how Islamic awakening started slowly 
after Ataturk's death and concludes: "The Arab and Islamic 
world is witnessing a common intricate process to retrieve its 
Islamic identity. The clever rulers -- if they do exist -- must 
not uselessly burden the nation with conflicts and shocks. 
While Turkey seeks to include the Islamic movement in its 
democratic process, the very clever rulers of Egypt still think 
that they can liquidate the Islamic movement, thus making us 
suffer from internal attrition for a while longer and making 
sure that Islamic victory is born only through pain, suffering, 
and bleeding." 
<H5>  CHIEF EDITOR NOTES DESTRUCTION OF LIBERTIES </H5>
  Page 2 also features a 1,000-word article by Chief Editor 
Majdi Ahmad Husayn in which he draws attention to the erosion of 
the democratic system in Egypt. He notes that at the beginning 
of "our lame democratic experiment" the regime applied democracy 
little-by-little because the Egyptian people were not advanced 
and could not adapt to democracy all at once, the situation has 
worsened since the president's third term. The regime has moved 
to "exclude liberties from the democratic system 
little-by-little." The writer also criticizes the government's 
mishandling of the case of the millionaire Ishaq Hakim who 
swindled the banks and individuals of tens of millions of pounds. 
<H5>  LAWYERS MODERATION, NATIONAL UNITY UNDERLINED </H5>
  A 1,500-word article by Qutb al-'Arabi on page 3 discusses 
the lawyers' crisis. The writer says that despite the heated 
debate that took place during the meeting of the general lawyers 
syndicate council and the branch syndicates last Wednesday 
evening, the final resolutions were moderate, aimed at finding a 
"peaceful solution to the crisis." The resolutions called for 
sending a letter in the name of the branch syndicates to the 
president of the republic and forming a delegation of the 
syndicate council to meet with the prime minister to demand an 
immediate investigation of the death of lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith 
Madani and the quick release of the detainees. 
  The writer adds that while the lawyers syndicate displayed a 
measure of flexibility in dealing with the crisis and gave the 
government a chance to solve the crisis peacefully, the 
government did not show any flexibility and escalated its 
measures against the lawyers by continuing to detain the 
lawyers' leaders, including some members of the syndicate 
council, and maintaining the media campaign against the 
syndicate. 
  A 500-word unattributed article on the same page notes that 
the lawyers' crisis has enhanced national unity among the 
lawyers. The article says "the recent lawyers' syndicate crisis 
has highlighted the genuine unity among the lawyers, despite 
differences in their political and religious affiliations." 
During the lawyers demonstration, Sayf-al-Islam al-Banna 
(Muslim Brotherhood) stood next to the Nasirist Samih 'Ashur, 
the Wafdist 'Abd-al-Halim Mandhur, and the communist Nabil 
al-Hilali. Three Copts were among the lawyers and citizens 
arrested by the police. Coptic lawyers also took part in 
defending their arrested brothers. 
<H5>  WRITER VIEWS MIDDLE EASTERN MARKET FROM ISLAMIC STANDPOINT </H5>
  AL-SHA'B publishes an 500-word article by Dr. Husayn 
Shahatah 
on page 5 in which he views the proposed Middle Eastern common 
market from an Islamic economic standpoint. He notes that the 
purpose of the Islamic economy is to develop the land to achieve 
a good and dignified life for the people to worship to God. 
Economy in Islam is linked to moral and religious values. God 
has prohibited monopoly, fraud, and exploitation. But, the 
writer continues, the proposed Middle Eastern market will not be 
like that. It will be a crusader, Zionist market dominated by 
the Jews. "A study and analysis of everything that has been 
published about the purpose and objectives of this market 
reveals that the aim is to control the resources of the Arab 
Islamic nation and bring it under the hegemony of the Jews 
(Israel), the United States, and the West." This is economic 
exploitation. They want to subordinate the Arab Islamic states 
to non-Muslims to "control their political, educational, social, 
and economic decisions." 
<H5>  MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD DEPUTY GUIDE PREACHES ISLAMIC VALUES </H5>
  Muslim Brotherhood Deputy Guide Mustafa Mashhur publishes an 
1,800 word article on page 5 in which he attempts to promote 
Islam. He begins by citing passages from a book by Imam 
al-Banna, founder of the Islamic Brotherhood movement, entitled 
"The Brothers Under the Banner of the Koran," in which he 
explains the purity, honesty, and universality of the Islamic 
faith. Mashhur notes that the prophet began his mission alone. 
He faced great difficulties. But God's light descended on him 
and dispelled the darkness of ignorance within a few years, 
clearing the Arabian Peninsula of idols and infidels. 
  He then explains how the invasion of materialistic cultures 
left their effect on the Islamic countries, prompting the 
Muslims to deviate from the essence of their religion. He 
quotes the following passage from Imam al-Banna's book: "Our 
duty is to face this wave of materialistic culture until it 
recedes and our nation becomes free of its afflictions. We must 
not stop there, but pursue it in its own country until the 
entire world shouts the name of the prophet, may God's prayers 
and peace be upon him, and the canopy of Islam spread over the 
earth." 
  Mashhur adds: "All Muslims have a responsibility before God 
to spread this true religion and to save humanity from the 
darkness of materialism, its tyranny and oppression, and to 
bring humanity to the light of Islam, its justice, security, and 
peace." Islam, he says, is a complete and comprehensive 
religion, because it is from God, who is complete. 
  Mashhur then moves on to refute the claim of some "defeated 
writers that the Islamists want to establish a religious 
government with divine authority as in the middle ages. He also 
refutes the claim that the Islamists are "seeking to overthrow 
the present regime." He says this is a false claim, refuted by 
reality and facts. "We believe in pluralism and democracy that 
adheres to the teachings of Islam, which is the official 
religion of the state. We do not believe in violence or 
anything of that sort. We do not seek power for ourselves." 
Those who work for Islam, he concludes, will not relax or 
weaken as their reward will be with God. 
<H5>  COLUMNIST HIGHLIGHTS SITUATION OF MUSLIMS IN AFRICA </H5>
  In his 200-word regular column "This is Our Religion" on 
page 
12, Muhammad al-Ghazali brings attention to the situation of the 
Muslims in Africa. He notes how European colonialism 
partitioned Africa in such a way as to deprive the Muslims of an 
independent state. He concludes that the "Muslims south of 
Egypt and Sudan, and around the Horn of Africa are facing strife 
and loss. Plans are being implemented to liquidate them and 
their religion. Zionism and the crusaders are behind this new 
offensive. An unjust and treacherous threat is facing the 
Muslims in this area, and those of us in the Nile Valley and the 
Arabian Peninsula must be aware of what is happening and probe 
its dimensions. If it does not hit us today, it will not miss 
us tomorrow."

  [Text] Gaza, 22 Jun (MENA) -- Furayh Abu-Middayn, minister 
of justice in the Palestinian National Authority [PNA], has 
stated that it is important to have legal control over the 
Palestinian streets and enforce the sovereignty of the law in 
all spheres, including traffic regulations, respect for private 
property, and other affairs. He pointed out that this is 
necessary after the past four years, during which there was a 
clear lack of control. 
  In an exclusive interview with MENA in Gaza, Abu-Middayn 
said 
that this control has actually begun and that after the 
Palestinian police arrived, carrying weapons in public has 
disappeared, apart from those who possess licensed arms. 
  He explained that another new phenomenon has been the 
holding 
of the Egyptian-curriculum general secondary education 
examination in a legal manner without cheating and other 
irregularities that had plagued past examinations. 
  Concerning education in the Gaza Strip, Abu-Middayn said it 
has always been linked with Egypt. He pointed out that the 
golden age of Gaza education was in the 1950's and 1960's when 
Palestinian graduates of Egyptian universities spread in the 
world bearing their degrees. He said 1,500 Palestinians 
graduated annually from those universities. 
  He asserted that Egypt has always remained committed to the 
maintenance of high standards of education in Gaza and the 
curricula taught were Egyptian curricula. He explained that 
with regard to the general secondary education examination, 
Egypt handles the entire supervisory process and corrects the 
examination papers. 
  Abu-Middayn said that this educational link with Egypt has 
strengthened the bond with that fraternal country, a sentiment 
that is clearly felt in Gaza's streets. He noted that this 
cultural link strengthened Palestinian steadfastness during the 
years of occupation. 
  Abu-Middayn told MENA that during this week's general 
education examination in Gaza, the Palestinian police oversaw 
the examination committees in an outsider supervisory capacity 
and this ended the cheating that used to take place in the past 
few years. 
  Asked what laws were being used in Gaza now, the PNA justice 
minister said that the central law now used is the Constitution 
of 1962, which separates the executive, judicial, and 
legislative powers and lays down the legal provisions of these 
powers. He noted that the Constitution also details the 
provisions of individual liberties. He explained that this 
Constitution, which was drawn up during the late President Jamal 
'Abd-al-Nasir's tenure, is still in force. He also said there 
are Palestinian laws dating back to Ottoman times but the major 
part of the laws were enacted during the British mandate. 
  Furayh Abu-Middayn said that during the Egyptian 
administration of the Gaza Strip these laws were amended to meet 
the wishes of the Palestinians. The legislation was based upon 
the desires of the Palestinians. 
  He clarified that the effort exerted during the 18 years of 
Palestinian administration was destroyed completely during the 
past 27 years because Israel passed 1,200 military orders that 
govern all aspects of daily life, from security restrictions 
down to educational controls. These orders included all aspects 
of daily life, which was "the most dangerous issue confronting 
us." 
  The minister of justice in the PNA said that the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement did not in fact cancel all these 
orders. He noted that there are texts stipulating, for example, 
that if there are any differences regarding certain issues, they 
will be referred to legislators of the highest order, and so on. 
  Mr. Furayh Abu-Middayn said: We will not abide by the 
military orders except as they benefit the Palestinian people 
because there are trade and material dealings that have taken 
place during the past 27 years which we cannot erase with the 
stroke of a pen. 
  To illustrate this point, he gave the example of the 
securities and traffic law which was being applied in the Gaza 
Strip. He pointed out that these progressive laws could be 
reformulated and made use of once again. 
  He said that the laws we will respect, as stipulated by the 
agreement, are those laws dealing with external security and the 
security of the settlements. He clarified that these are things 
they will not interfere in. However, contrary to this point, we 
will cancel all laws that go against the wishes of our people, 
in accordance with the Fourth Geneva Convention, which forbids 
the occupier of a land from enforcing any laws except for those 
dealing with security only. 
  He gave the example of the value added tax Israel enforced 
on 
the Gazans amounting to 17 percent on all goods. He affirmed 
that the PNA will cancel any laws violating the Geneva 
Convention and going against the interests of our people. 
  Mr. Furayh Abu-Middayn said: We are also reorganizing the 
judiciary so that it would become an independent and sovereign 
entity that does not submit to any organization because this is 
the only guarantee that could safeguard us against deviations. 
  The Palestinian justice minister added in his interview with 
MENA: We are also reorganizing and arranging the general 
prosecution and adding new branches to it. He said: We might 
turn to legal experts from sisterly Egypt for help in this task 
because until 5 June 1967 the prosecutor general was from Egypt. 
  The Palestinian official said: We will also try to avoid the 
state security and military court. But there have been cases of 
spying. We are not talking about agents who have stopped their 
activities, but about those who opt to continue cooperating with 
the Israelis. We will not allow that at all. 
  He said there are those who are putting pressure on us to 
form a military court. But President 'Arafat and I personally 
prefer to refer such cases to a civilian court. 
  He clarified that this is a sensitive topic that we will 
address with wisdom. However, we consider the continuation of 
cases of spying for Israel a violation of the peace agreements. 
  He affirmed that we will condemn any individual who causes 
the death of a Palestinian citizen, because such an individual 
will be working for a third party. 
  Continuing his remarks in the interview, PNA Minister of 
Justice Furayh Abu-Middayn said: We will begin from scratch. 
We need narcotics laboratories to analyze drugs so that all 
criminals will be brought to justice. We also need to conduct 
post-mortem examinations in homicides cases. We still do not 
have archives for fingerprints and criminal evidence. We need a 
lot of things. 
  Abu-Middayn added: We have enough Palestinian 
qualifications, but we are still short of capabilities and 
material prerequisites. We are still just beginning and we are 
short of everything. We have been completely linked to Israel 
during its 27 years of occupation. There is no infrastructure in 
Gaza and we must be self-sufficient or we will remain tied down 
by the occupation. Europe and the United States must help us to 
face the circumstances. 
  In his interview, Abu-Middayn said that Europe was rebuilt 
after World War II with the Marshall Plan. The West established 
Israel here. When [Egyptian President] 'Abd-al-Nasir 
nationalized the Suez Canal [in 1956], the French supplied 
Israel with atomic capabilities. But we are only demanding 
bread. 
  Abu-Middayn asserted that the Europeans must understand that 
the Palestinian people are determined to make the Middle East 
peace a success. He added: However, we do not need peace on 
paper or artificial security. We need genuine peace. The new 
Middle East cannot be built at the expense of our rights. The 
world must help the Palestinians so that peace will be achieved 
in the region. We want to close the file on this cause. 
  Abu-Middayn added: We are trying to tell the Israelis to 
leave the Palestinians alone so that new relations can be set 
up. We have offered 65,000 martyrs over the past 45 years. 
Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria also offered thousands of 
martyrs. This file must be closed. 
  Abu-Middayn pointed out that the Israeli-Palestinian 
agreement is not the dream of the Palestinian people. It is 
also unfair. But it is the best that we can get. 
  As regards the agents collaborating with Israel, the 
Palestinian official noted that those who ceased their 
cooperation with Israel after the signing of the agreement in 
Washington on 13 September will not be sought. He denied that 
there are 22,000 agents. We know all the agents, he added. 
Abu-Middayn said that anyone who kills Palestinians will be 
hanged. He was referring to the operation in which six 
Palestinians were killed on 25 April. 
  Concluding his interview with MENA, Abu-Middayn said that 
Israel's agents will not enter Gaza. Israel will not be able to 
carry out operations with the aim of driving a wedge between the 
organizations because communications continue among them.

  [Text] Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi, the person in charge 
of economic affairs in the autonomy, said upon arriving in 
Jericho that he is opposed to the economic agreement signed with 
Israel since, in his opinion, this entire agreement works in 
Israel's favor and lacks the basic conditions for the 
realization of the Palestinians' rights. Our correspondent Moti 
Amir reports that in a talk with correspondents al-Nashashibi 
said he would base the Palestinian budget and daily expenditures 
on the collection of taxes. In a few days he intends to 
establish the nucleus for the Palestinian Finance Ministry in 
Jericho, and later he will recruit employees and experts who 
will work in this ministry's offices in Jericho and the Gaza 
Strip. 
  Our correspondent adds that Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat leveled harsh 
criticism at IDF [Israel Defense Forces] officers in the Jericho 
area, saying the IDF still behaves like an occupying Army, 
blocking the town and barring tourists from entering, although 
it is clear that tourism is an important economic branch for the 
regional residents. According to 'Urayqat, one of the IDF 
officers said at the joint security committee that Jericho can 
be reoccupied within five minutes, and such a statement only 
proves the Israeli Army's aggressiveness.

<F P=106> [Telephone Interview with Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, member of the </F>
Palestinian National Authority, in Jerusalem, by Fawzi al-Jundi, 
in Cairo; date not given; from the "Dialogue From Afar" -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Jundi] Dr. 'Urayqat, welcome to our program. 
  ['Urayqat] Thank you. 
  [Al-Jundi] Concerning the Palestinian detainees that Israel 
pledged to release in accordance with the Cairo agreement, what 
is the latest news? 
  ['Urayqat] The Cairo agreement clearly states that during 
the 
five weeks following the signing of the agreement the Israeli 
Government would release 5,000 detainees. Some of these 
detainees, the political detainees, were supposed to be freed 
with no strings attached and allowed to go to their homes in the 
West Bank and Gaza. Others were to be handed over to the 
Palestinian Authority until their sentences ended. In our 
understanding, the latter detainees are those held on criminal 
charges. 
  However, currently the Israeli Government is releasing 
political detainees and dumping them at the checkpoints around 
Jericho, practically forcing us to keep them in Jericho and 
preventing them from leaving. The Israelis freed 280 detainees 
this way and plan to do the same with another 1,000. This 
procedure contravenes the fourth Geneva Convention, which states 
that the authorities who release a prisoner are responsible for 
his safe transport to his home town. It also contravenes the 
Cairo agreement and places the Palestinian Authority in a very 
delicate position; it knows that the Jericho area cannot absorb 
such great numbers because it lacks the necessary infrastructure. 
  [Al-Jundi] Dr. 'Urayqat, do you think that Israel, through 
such measures, means to disrupt the work of the Palestinian 
National Authority? 
  ['Urayqat] There is another matter. For the past eight days, 
Israeli authorities have prevented tourists from coming to 
Jericho. Jericho, as you may know, is a tourist area that 
normally receives about 1,000 tourists per day. Tourism 
provides the main income for most people, workers as well as 
hotel and restaurant owners. For the past eight days, Israel 
has prevented tourists from coming to Jericho, claiming that it 
is unsafe. In doing so, Israel is fully aware of the 
devastation it is causing to a major economic activity in this 
area. 
  Furthermore, Palestinians face harassment at Israeli 
checkpoints. The Israeli Government is still thinking of itself 
as an occupier. It has not, for one moment, tried to think of 
itself as a peace-maker or a neighbor. It hastens to seal off 
Gaza and Jericho as soon as any incident occurs. In my opinion, 
such acts mean that the agreement is not being given a chance 
and the Israeli Government alone is to blame. Israel has left 
us this area in economic shambles. Israel, which has occupied 
this area for the past 27 years, must be aware of the burning 
need to create a reliable infrastructure in it. We have begun 
to build this infrastructure with our own resources, but these 
resources, and the Israeli Government knows this, are 
negligible. Israel knows that during the past month we have 
begun operating more than 30 departments. If Israel continues 
to pursue its current policies, this area will be left with a 
bleak future. If Rabin's aim is to undermine the current 
effort, he, in my opinion, is about to succeed. 
  [Al-Jundi] Has a specific date been set for the arrival of 
Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat to the self-rule areas? 
  ['Urayqat] This issue has nothing to do with the arrival of 
President Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat]. It is related to 
requirements that must be met so he may travel to the self-rule 
area. In other words, the donor countries have not yet 
implemented any of the projects they promised. The people judge 
peace, and trust it according to the tangible changes they see 
on the ground. They do not care for clauses, figures, or words. 
The countries that agreed to implement projects have not done 
so. The Palestinians have done all that they were required, on 
all levels. We exerted great efforts to activate all 
departments, and preparations are under way to establish other 
essential departments. However, the issue is that before 
president Abu-'Ammar arrives, basic requirements must be 
available that up to now have been nonexistent. After 27 years 
of occupation the infrastructure is destroyed. The Jericho 
hospital in 1967 was much better than it is now. The same goes 
for the irrigation system, water, electricity, roads, and all 
other utilities. We maintain that 2,600 projects were approved 
for the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The donor nations agreed 
to implement these projects at their own expense and the 
necessary funds were specified. The question posed now is why 
these projects are not being implemented. I believe that the 
Palestinian National Authority, no matter what its capabilities, 
will begin its work 27 years late; that is, the natural 
development in this area stopped 27 years ago. No matter how 
hard or fast we work, for years we will lag behind. In other 
words, the longer the donor countries take to implement these 
projects, the more problems we will face. Therefore, these 
projects must be implemented, so the Palestinian National 
Authority may do its duty. 
  [Al-Jundi] The Palestinian effort is the main factor in 
development along with the foreign aid? 
  ['Urayqat] Certainly. All I want to say is that we are 
extremely poor people, particularly in Gaza, Jericho, and the 
rest of the West Bank. So we cannot deliver with our own 
resources. We have succeeded in activating 30 departments where 
we process documents and papers. We have processed more than 
1,000 documents in less than three weeks; but we need resources 
to work out new systems and establish other departments. We 
have done this with our own resources. The sons of our people 
contributed time and effort to this. What we reached in Paris 
was an agreement approving payment of salaries from now until 
August. This is good, but what I mean is that the requirements 
of the infrastructure and securing these requirements, are 
necessary to turn the wheel of the Palestinian economy. We need 
essential infrastructure projects to turn the wheel of the 
economy. We need resources to create jobs, to encourage private 
investments, and to create an integrated economic atmosphere so 
that the wheel of the economy may turn. As I said, no matter 
how fast or hard we work we will be lagging behind for many 
years. 
  [Al-Jundi] Thank you Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat. 
  ['Urayqat] Thank you.

  [Text] The appointed Palestinian Housing Minister, 
Zakariya al-Agha, said that the ministry is planning to 
establish Palestinian housing neighborhoods in the Jewish 
settlements in Gaza that he is assured will be evacuated in 
three years time, according to the agreement with Israel. 
  He pointed out that the plans being prepared aim to find an 
urgent solution to the problem of lack of land in Gaza for 
constructing houses. 
  Al-Agha said that the Palestinians are in need of 250,000 
housing units, 110,000 of them are needed in Gaza and he refuses 
to build skyscrapers of more than eight storeys each. "We want 
to keep the general character of Gaza." 
  Al-Agha revealed that the headquarters of his ministry will 
be in Gaza, and indicated that the reason behind this decision 
is that his ministry will be needed there as most of its work 
will be focused in Gaza, while branches of the ministry in other 
parts will be in the West Bank and Jerusalem. 
  He expects that these projects will absorb most of the labor 
force in construction. "The implementation of this plan will 
need 150,000 laborers," he added. 
  Al-Agha said that his ministry will coordinate with the 
Higher Palestinian Council and will try to enroll the council 
with the ministry responsibilities.

  [Text] Reliable information from Fatah sources indicates 
that Khalid al-Hasan, considered one of Fatah's historic leaders 
and the most prominent member of Fatah's founding Central 
Committee, is currently thinking of emerging from the isolation 
that he imposed on himself following the signing of the Oslo 
accord and is planning to launch an opposition political party. 
  It is common knowledge that al-Hasan enjoys the support of 
sectors in Fatah as he was the first to broach the issue of a 
political settlement with Israel. However, he opposed the 
current peace process and the agreements stemming from it 
because they do not respond to the Palestinian people's minimum 
national rights, as he viewed and continues to view them in his 
theory for a settlement.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar, "one of the most </F>
prominent Islamic trend leaders in Gaza" by Sophia 'Amarah in 
Gaza; date not given; from "The Event" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] ['Amarah] Dr. al-Zahhar, what formula does Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement] set for dealing with the 
Palestinian National Authority [PNA]? 
  [Al-Zahhar] Certain yardsticks and principles govern Hamas' 
dealing with the PNA. The first point is that we welcome the 
return of every Palestinian who has lived in the diaspora. This 
does not mean we approve of the autonomy or that we agree to 
participate in it. The second point is that we are against 
internecine fighting and against shedding Palestinian blood at 
the hands of Palestinians, no matter the causes or motives. The 
third point is that we do not participate in the PNA. However, 
as sons of this homeland, we will participate in all elections 
that will serve the people, whether municipal, rural council, 
chambers of commerce, or trade union and student elections. The 
fourth point is that we support the freedom of action of any 
person who works to serve this homeland. We believe every 
Palestinian, after the protracted period of occupation, has the 
right to have his own means of dealing with the public through 
the establishment of party and media institutions. Every person 
has the right to demonstrate and to express his opinion. 
  ['Amarah] Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar, some problems emerged 
between 
Hamas and the Palestinian police at the beginning. Are there 
still any problems? What is Hamas' real position on the issue 
of security in the autonomy areas? 
  [Al-Zahhar] We regret to say that the stand of the police 
was 
unjustified. While the police force had not yet completed its 
organization, the agents did their best to fabricate sedition to 
kill Fatah and Hamas leaders and to set the occupied territories 
on fire. They made confessions to this effect. While the 
Palestinian force had not completed its organization, it was 
necessary to end this sedition and put out this fire. The 
Palestinian police made several statements that were 
unacceptable to the ordinary Palestinian, and to Hamas. Matters 
remained as they are. We hope that in the not too distant 
future, these differences will be settled and that a balanced 
formula can be forged for dealings between the PNA and all the 
forces which have a presence in the occupied territories, 
particularly the opposition forces. 
  ['Amarah] Where does the movement stand on the residual 
Israeli military presence in the Gaza strip? 
  [Al-Zahhar] As far as we are concerned, it is not a residual 
presence. Occupation is present. What happened was a 
redeployment of occupation forces. Israel left some sections of 
Gaza for other sections of Gaza. If anything, Israel has 
stepped up its presence. It is in control of crossings and the 
main roads that link the Gaza strip and its villages. It is in 
control of livelihoods and everything. So, for us it is 
rationed occupation and it is unacceptable. Palestinians are 
entitled to defend themselves against occupation, from which 
they have suffered a great deal. 
  ['Amarah] Will Hamas [word indistinct] continue the armed 
struggle against occupation in the occupied territory of the 
West Bank? 
  [Al-Zahhar] That is what Hamas said in its latest leaflet, 
emphasizing its continuing jihad line. The leaflet that was 
issued on 15 June emphasized Hamas' and other Palestinian 
factions' right to defend themselves against the Israeli 
presence in the occupied land, whether that takes the form of 
soldiers or settlers. 
  ['Amarah] Preparation has begun for [words indistinct] 
Palestinian elections. Are you prepared to run in these 
elections alongside the Palestinian Authority? 
  [Al-Zahhar] The Islamic side, Hamas in particular, will not 
contest the self-rule elections. As for elections that are 
unconnected with the self-rule authority, as I have said, these 
will be contested, as has been our practice during occupation. 
  ['Amarah] Israel recently levelled accusations that Hamas 
has been receiving aid [word indistinct] from Saudi Arabia and 
Iran, [word indistinct] the chances for a peace settlement. 
  [Al-Zahhar] There is nothing wrong with Hamas or the other 
factions receiving assistance from brother Arabs or Muslims. 
However, Hamas has not received a single piaster from the Saudi 
government. An ordinary Muslim, whether in Saudi Arabia or 
anywhere else, contributes zakat [alms tax], which comes to 2.5 
percent [of a Muslim's income] annually, and this is given to 
known categories in Islam -- the poor, those who handle the 
zakat and for those engaged in the zakat raising effort and the 
effort to get slaves freed and for needy strangers. As you 
know, the Palestinian people are going through exceptional 
circumstances -- poverty, [word indistinct], displacement, and 
deportation, and consequently, they qualify for zakat. A Saudi, 
Gulf, or Egyptian Muslim or any other Muslim, even in Europe and 
America, collects zakat so the money can be spent on 
Palestinians who fill the conditions of zakat. But, thus far, 
Hamas has not received a single piaster from the Saudi 
government. 
  ['Amarah] One last question. The Palestinian opposition 
wants to form a broad national front to abort the settlement 
between Israel and the PLO. Has Hamas and the other Palestinian 
factions worked out an agreement? Are you truly prepared to 
enter into effective participation in such a front? 
  [Al-Zahhar] [Words indistinct] the 10 factions outside 
[words indistinct]. I personally support the call to form a 
broad national Islamic front to tackle the inadequacies of 
self-rule, especially those with a negative impact on the 
national cause and Islamic sanctities and on the (?homeland) in 
general, provided that the formula is well-defined and not 
(?inconsistent) with our national cause or our religious creed 
and (?helps) the Palestinian street for the sake of the 
interests of the Palestinian people [words indistinct] and 
government in line with the rules I already pointed out.

<F P=106> [Report by Army affairs correspondent Roni Daniyel] </F>
  [Text] Sami Abu-Samahdanah, a leading Fatah official in 
the Gaza Strip, was arrested and later released for blocking the 
Netzarim junction because -- so he claimed -- shots were fired 
at him from the settlement of Netzarim. His takeover of the 
junction was recorded on film, Israel lodged a complaint, and 
Abu-Samahdanah was arrested by the Palestinian police. However, 
there is a follow-up to this story. Our Army affairs 
correspondent Roni Daniyel reports: 
  [Begin Daniyel recording] Sami Abu-Samahdanah, a leading 
Fatah official in the Gaza Strip, wanted to make a show of 
muscle. He summoned television crews to the Netzarim junction 
to show everybody that he could take over the junction. The 
embarrassment was mutual, both for the Israelis and the 
Palestinian policemen. Abu-Samahdanah and his followers pulled 
out guns, said they were there to stay, and that they would not 
allow Jews to cross. 
  Nine of his followers were arrested yesterday, and last 
night 
Abu-Samahdanah himself was summoned to the Khan Yunus police 
station. It would seem, however, that the friendly attitude of 
the Palestinian policemen during the dispersal of the 
demonstration continued there as well. Abu-Samahdanah was 
released. Moreover, he was recruited to Muhammad Dahlan's 
security apparatus, his followers were stationed in a training 
camp, and the Abu-Sittah brothers -- who were arrested on 
suspicion of having murdered the late Uri Magidish -- will serve 
in the unarmed police. A Gaza-style solution. [end recording]

  [Text] It has been learned from reliable sources that 
three Palestinian businessmen, together with Bassam Abu-Sharif, 
President Yasir Arafat's adviser, are currently studying a joint 
project for to set up a private television station in the 
autonomy area. 
  Visitors from Amman say that the four held a meeting last 
week at Queen 'Aliya Airport and agreed on the broad outlines of 
their project, including the fact that the project will be 
managed by Abu-Sharif. They also agreed to hold another meeting 
soon in order to put the final touches on the project.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has said that Israel 
is not prepared to accept Syria's proposal to first cede the 
Golan Heights and uproot settlements there and only then to 
enter negotiations. Minister Peres noted that Israel is 
conducting talks with the Syrians on three levels: territory, 
the nature of peace, and security arrangements. The foreign 
minister stressed that had the Syrian president signed a peace 
treaty with Israel together with President al-Sadat, he would 
have received everything the Egyptian president did. Our 
correspondent Meron Tzur reports that Mr. Peres was speaking in 
a rally of Army veterans in Tel Aviv.

  [Text] Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's ambassador in the 
United States, said that a date and level has so far not been 
set for meetings between Israeli and Jordanian representatives. 
Responding to King Husayn's remarks that there would soon be 
overt meetings between the two countries, Ambassador Rabinovich 
said that although important progress has been made in the 
negotiations with Jordan, issues have to be defined precisely 
prior to overt meetings. The ambassador added that U.S. 
Secretary of State Christopher is planning to visit the region 
in July. 
  Ambassador Rabinovich said the focus in the Israeli-Syrian 
negotiations must be a direct dialogue between the sides. The 
ambassador remarks to our correspondent Ya'el Eylon at a meeting 
of Jewish leaders at the president's residence in Jerusalem.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Ministry Director General </F>
Uri Savir by Mikha Friedman and Ya'el Dan, on 22 June; place not 
given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Friedman] In view of our close acquaintance with 
King Husayn, and the general view that for every step forward he 
makes, he immediately makes two steps back, would you suggest 
that Yitzhaq Rabin have a new suit made up for a meeting with 
Husayn in October? 
  [Savir] This government and its prime minister had their 
peace suits made up a long time ago. I disagree with you and 
think that what we see in almost all the tracks is two steps 
forward and one step back. There are those who are too 
influenced by the steps back. I think there has been a 
development in the Jordanian position, and it should be welcomed. 
  [Friedman] Nevertheless, Israeli journalists were not 
allowed into the monarch's Washington news conference yesterday. 
That is not something indicating an imminent breakthrough in 
relations between the two states. 
  [Savir] That is precisely the step backward. I watched the 
news conference where the king referred to anticipated meetings 
at a high level and Jordan's independence. I think that despite 
all the caution, we should see it as a positive development. 
What is interesting is that each time we see progress in a 
certain track -- this time it was again in the Palestinian 
track, that is implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement -- 
we later see progress in the other tracks. If previously in the 
peace process the lowest common denominator pulled everything 
down, now the highest common denominator pulls everybody 
forward. The train has left the station, and King Husayn does 
not want to miss it. 
  [Dan] Do you not see any impact from the Jordanian track on 
the negotiations with Syria? Do you believe the Syrian 
president is really being indulgent? 
  [Savir] I would not count on it. I think Husayn looks in 
the Palestinian direction and observes the fact that an economic 
agreement has been signed. The moves should be seen against the 
background of the economies in the region. I think that due to 
the Israeli-Palestinian economic accord, there is a Jordanian 
desire to join the various agreements, in order to make sure it 
is not being left out. The monarch apparently feels that 
al-Asad is progressing and is not necessarily asking for his 
opinion. 'Arafat also acted that way. If the king waits for 
others all the time, he will come out the loser on all sides. 
  [Friedman] We discussed Syria, and yesterday we read that 
Israel's Foreign Ministry has finally been brought into the 
negotiations with Syria after being exclusively the hands of the 
prime minister for months. 
  [Savir] That is incorrect because the foreign minister and 
his ministry were full partners to that issue as well, and I do 
not think there has been a change because there was no need for 
one. 
  [Dan] Please help us to understand the Ahmad al-Tibi issue. 
Why does it crop up now? 
  [Savir] I think it is coincidental. It cropped up a long 
time ago. At the outset when the PLO issue was new, we might 
have been mixed up, but the moment the contacts with the PLO 
became established, it was clear that Israel cannot conduct 
political negotiations via Israeli citizens as receivers of 
messages from the Arab side. Nobody has anything personal 
against al-Tibi. 
  [Dan] But he has been a partner to the contacts for a long 
time, therefore he says the whole thing is the outcome of a 
power struggle between the Prime Minister's Office and the 
Foreign Ministry. 
  [Savir] I regret to disappoint al-Tibi, but the Prime 
Minister's Office and the Foreign Ministry worked together 
throughout the Oslo talks, not with al-Tibi but with the PLO. 
It is true that later on he transferred a number of messages, 
and I can to a some extent understand his frustration, but I do 
not understand why as an Israeli citizen he takes it so much to 
heart. An Israeli citizen, whether Jew or Arab, cannot be an 
adviser to Yasir 'Arafat, but nobody plans to boycott him. 
Political contacts with the PLO are conducted with PLO 
officials. 
  [Friedman] Nevertheless, Yo'el Singer's legal opinion was 
issued on 17 October, 1993 -- eight months ago -- and last month 
Shim'on Peres met with al-Tibi twice in his office and at his 
home. 
  [Dan] The timing is strange. 
  [Savir] I do not know what happened last month. It is true 
al-Tibi came with certain messages, and I think that due to the 
novelty of that track it is possible that it should not have 
happened in the past and that is no reason why it should happen 
in the future. I think that at present we have a clear partner 
on the Palestinian issue and it is also clear to us who is a PLO 
official and who is an Israeli.

'Arafat will arrive in Jericho during the first week of July. 
The sources said 'Arafat will probably ask to meet with Prime 
Minister Rabin, but it is not clear whether such a meeting will 
take place. The security forces have decided to plan for 
'Arafat's upcoming visit. Among proposals are the closing off of 
all roads in the Jordan Valley during the visit.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen] </F>
  [Excerpt] Israel will propose that the PLO to extend the 
civilian activity of the Palestinian police force to the entire 
West Bank as part of the early empowerment to be discussed soon. 
A recommendation in this spirit is included in a study 
conducted by Major General Dani Rothschild. Our political 
correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Rosen] The next stage of the 
negotiations with the PLO will begin soon, and its highlight 
will be the early empowerment of Palestinians in the West Bank 
in five civilian spheres. The PLO has not yet made up its mind 
what and how much it wants from Israel. Nabil Sha'th spoke in 
very general terms about this issue in his meeting with Amnon 
Shahaq two days ago. 
  The staff work in anticipation of the negotiations is 
coordinated by Maj. Gen. Rothschild, the coordinator of 
activities in the territories. We have learned that the staff 
work, conducted in conjunction with the General Staff's Planning 
Branch, includes a recommendation to enable a Palestinian police 
or another Palestinian policing force to operate in the entire 
West Bank. 
  Knesset Member Ori Or today confirmed the existence of such 
a 
recommendation. 
  [Or] I do not want to go into too much detail, but we are 
talking about one of the five main issues which will be 
transferred to the Palestinians, which is taxation. Although 
there is yet nothing definite, when we talk about taxation that 
means that somebody must enforce it. I think it is also in our 
best interest to agree that the body dealing with taxation 
should possess the tools and the ability to collect the money. 
This body will need a police force -- we shall call it that for 
the sake of this argument -- to enforce taxation. 
  [Rosen] The staff work, which will soon be submitted to the 
prime minister, includes several suggestions for cooperation 
between this police force and the Israel Police and security 
forces. [passage omitted] [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Gabi Brunn, Arye Kiesel, Roni Shaqed, and Yuval </F>
Peleg] 
  [Excerpts] Israel is negotiating the PLO demand to release 
20 Israeli Arabs sentenced to life terms for terrorism. Among 
these prisoners are the murderers of the three soldiers killed 
in an IDF [Israel Defense Forces] encampment near Kibbutz Gil'ad 
in the attack later called "the night of the pitchforks." 
[passage omitted] 
  Also on the list of candidates for release is Muhammad 
Sarawi, a resident of the village of Ibtin near Haifa, who in 
1987 hurled a grenade in Haifa's Nordau pedestrian mall, 
wounding 25 people, including the child Dan Me'ir, whose leg was 
amputated. 
  PLO representatives to talks with Israel are basing 
themselves on the precedent of the "Jibril deal" in 1985, when 
Israeli Arabs involved in terrorism were also freed. Senior 
politicians in Jerusalem tend to accept the demand to free the 
Israeli Arabs. Among them is at least one cabinet minister, as 
well as Foreign Ministry officials. As far as is known, Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has still not made up his mind on the 
issue. 
  Knesset Member David Mena' yesterday cabled Rabin warning 
against releasing Israeli Arabs who murdered for nationalist 
motives. The Shin Bet is also opposed to the release of Israeli 
Arabs sentenced to life terms. This opposition was forcefully 
expressed in discussions held at the defense establishment and 
at government forums. Defense sources said that such a release 
would cause a sharp deterioration in the security situation and 
create a dangerous precedent. 
  YEDI'OT AHARONOT has nevertheless learned that parallel to 
the tendency to respond partially to the PLO demand on Israeli 
Arabs, the possibility of recommending pardoning Jews who 
murdered for nationalist reasons and who have already spent many 
years in prison has also been raised. The names of David 
Ben-Shimol and Yona Avrushmi have come up in this context.

to cross into Israel. In coordination with the International 
Red Cross, the Jordanians crossed the border over the Allenby 
Bridge where they were given special entry visas for three days 
only. They came here to visit Jordanian relatives held in

invited Palestinian policemen to a seminar in France on criminal 
identification, forensic science, and drug interdiction. 
  The French envoy promised that Paris would allocate $50,000

<F P=106> [Report by On Levi] </F>
  [Text] "I can foresee the possibility of a joint 
intelligence early warning system for us and the Arab states," 
Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur said in an interview with 
the Defense Ministry employees' bulletin. 
  He said there is a possibility that satellites will provide 
us and the Arabs with an early warning capability. 
  "We suppose the Arabs have also learned a lesson from the 
Gulf war in all matters pertaining to defense on the home 
front," Gur said. 
  According to Gur, "the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will have 
to show us how to be a modern, professional, and thrifty army, 
and at the same time remain a people's army." He said defense 
needs and the numbers in recent drafts have not permitted the 
Army to call up all candidates for military service. Some will 
be sent for national service and will not be recruited to the 
Army. 
  Gur said that "if we learn that the PLO leadership is 
incapable of controlling most of the population and leading it 
to real coexistence, the basic question will crop up about the 
justification for the autonomy." 
  In reference to Iraq, Gur -- a former chief of staff -- said 
that despite the fact that the Iraqi Army was seriously beaten 
in the Gulf war, it still has over 30 army divisions and 400 
aircraft. "Iraq also constitutes a serious nonconventional 
threat. There is no certainty that even after all the 
investigations inside Iraq we know about all they have," Gur 
said. 
  He also said that the Home Front Command is prepared to 
transfer allocation of gas masks to a civilian firm. He said 
"we are now organizing for continued allocation of the masks and 
if it becomes possible we will do it via a civilian business 
firm."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Meron Benvenisti: "Jericho Is No Substitute"] </F>
  [Text] The right-wing agitation and the government's 
stammering have diverted the controversy over the Jerusalem 
issue to marginal matters. The establishment of a command 
aiming to stop 'Arafat, the calls for his assassination, the 
Jerusalem Municipality tax collectors' move against Orient 
House, as well as Shim'on Peres' stuttering, legislative 
initiatives aimed to curb PLO activities, and the invitation 
extended to King Husayn to pray on the Temple Mount -- all these 
have served to divert attention from the main problem: The 
traditional Israeli stand on the Jerusalem issue does not 
correspond with the political reality that took root after the 
Declaration of Principles [DOP] was signed and the PLO was 
recognized. 
  In this sense, right-wing spokesmen are right in assailing 
the government for permitting the peace process to lead to 
concessions on the issue of Jerusalem, and the government cannot 
justify its stance by hiding behind hallowed formulas on the 
status of Israel's indivisible and nonnegotiable capital. 
  No matter how frequently government spokesmen declare their 
allegiance to the traditional stands, once the Palestinian 
national community was acknowledged and willingness to negotiate 
the implementation of its national objectives was voiced, that 
community and its collective link to Jerusalem became 
legitimate. The approximately 200,000 Palestinians who live in 
East Jerusalem (but are not Israeli citizens) have the right to 
feel an integral part of the Palestinian collective, and after 
the DOP, their right to organize their community life and to 
rally around their national symbols and authoritative 
institutions can no longer be denied. 
  Indeed, the traditional Israeli stand concerning the 
residents of East Jerusalem has been that the demarcation of the 
annexation borders severed the city's Arabs from the other West 
Bank residents, making them an inseparable part of the State of 
Israel. And yet, with the exception of Central Bureau of 
Statistics releases, in which East Jerusalem residents feature 
among the totals for Israeli Arabs (designated as "non-Jewish"), 
no one has ever considered East Jerusalem residents Israelis. 
  Israel annexed the territory of East Jerusalem but not its 
residents. They have remained aliens, deprived of basic civil 
rights, devoid of municipal services, and exposed to every kind 
of discrimination. Even the attempts to cultivate a minimum of 
coexistence expired with the onset of the intifadah, and Israeli 
Governments learned to accept the fact that East Jerusalemites 
cannot be separated from the great body of the West Bank 
population and that they must not cling to the illusion that 
East Jerusalem can be wrenched away from its province and made 
into some sort of new "mini-Triangle." 
  It was the intifadah that established Palestinian 
institutions in Jerusalem -- most notably Orient House -- and 
every Israeli Government put up with their existence. The DOP 
imbued these institutions with a new significance, and it is 
that with which the Rabin government is trying to deal. 
  The government decided to differentiate between "governing 
institutions" and "voluntary institutions" dealing with social 
and community activities. This distinction, which is equal to 
the illusion of cutting East Jerusalem off from West Jerusalem, 
is only a fantasy and is unbecoming of people who grew up in 
Israel's pioneer days and know how voluntary institutions -- 
such as the Histadrut labor federation -- can become the 
cornerstone of the "nascent state's" voluntary governing system. 
  The truth is that the continued existence of Jewish 
voluntary 
institutions with "governing characteristics" is responsible for 
the legal experts' inability to propose legislation restricting 
the activity of the Palestinian institutions. 
  As long as the Jewish National Fund is situated in the 
western part of the city, its Palestinian parallel can hardly be 
banned without risking an appeal to the High Court of Justice 
that will discuss the petition on the basis of Israeli 
legislation and basic laws. 
  The attempts to harass the East Jerusalem Palestinian 
institutions will be as successful as the closure, which 
supposedly cut the city off from its surroundings, although it 
is no secret that anyone can enter it. Nonetheless, the 
government is tackling the institutions exactly as it did the 
closure: It would like to keep up appearances in order to 
discourage public debate. 
  It may be able to prevent Yasir 'Arafat from coming to 
Jerusalem, but it cannot move Arab Jerusalem to Jericho. 
  Israelis who believe in the unity of Jerusalem will also 
have 
to accept the continued existence of central Palestinian 
institutions in East Jerusalem. They would do well to remember 
the postannexation years, when the Government of Israel made 
every possible effort -- all of which failed -- to move the 
Palestinian institutions to Ramallah. 
  East Jerusalem is the West Bank's economic, political, and 
social center, and it is the hub of the Palestinians' religious 
and national life. 
  This fact can be neither obfuscated nor forcibly changed. 
The sooner the Israelis accept this, the faster will the root 
of the problem be discussed. The debate will then focus on the 
search for new formulas to resolve the Jerusalem issue -- 
formulas that will correspond to the new political situation and 
will not be based on illusions and wishful thinking.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ze'ev Schiff: "The Israeli Aspect of the </F>
Korean Crisis"] 
  [Text] In his testimony to Congress, the deputy director 
of the CIA warned that if North Korea comes out of the 
confrontation over the development of nuclear weapons with the 
upper hand, it would pose a threat to Israel and Europe. But 
this crisis has an Israeli angle no matter what happens. Even 
if we assume that a solution would be found to the crisis, and 
Pyongyang renounces nuclear weapons and meets the terms for 
outside supervision, for Israel it would mean that the time is 
approaching when the international community would insist that 
it join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). The club of 
states suspected of developing nuclear weapons will be reduced, 
and it is only natural that there will be an effort to cut it 
back even further prior to the treaty's renewal in 1995. 
  Israel is unlike North Korea in every way, but on that issue 
it might look like an obstacle to an improved world order, and 
that would make it more difficult for Israel to explain why the 
time has still not come to join the treaty when it is renewed 
next year. 
  The Korean crisis must teach Israel one other thing: That 
small states cannot cut themselves off from the NPT as they 
please even if they have good reasons for doing so. The current 
treaty says that each signatory state has the right to pull out 
after giving three-months notice of its intention, which is what 
North Korea did. Yet North Korea found that it had joined a 
club that includes ties to a Catholic marriage, which does not 
recognize divorce. An attempt to withdraw from the treaty for 
any reason could bring sanctions and even a military 
confrontation with the international community. There is a 
difference between somebody suspected of possessing nuclear 
weapons, but is not a signatory to the treaty, and somebody 
suspected of violating the treaty, the policy toward the latter 
being much tougher. 
  A North Korean victory in the current struggle would 
complicate matters greatly for the international community, but 
for Israel it could end with a direct threat. The threat does 
not come directly from North Korea. The immediate circle 
affected would be the Far East. North Korea's neighbors would 
find it hard to go on with normal business while its radical 
neighbor arms itself with nuclear weapons. In Japan, which has 
large quantities of plutonium, the demand to develop nuclear 
weapons despite its troubled past would swell. The same is true 
for South Korea and Taiwan. Regional stability would be 
undermined, something China also fears. 
  The second circle to be affected is made up of states like 
Iran and Iraq, and perhaps also Algeria in the future. If 
Washington fails in its stand off with Pyongyang, why should 
Tehran be put off developing nuclear weapons, and why should 
Saddam Husayn not go back to his old plan after sanctions are 
lifted on Iraq? It is only natural that Tehran and Baghdad have 
a direct interest in what is currently happening in the Korean 
peninsula. Washington therefore views the conflict as a 
confrontation over world order and not only as an attempt to 
restrain the North Korean regime. 
  The danger to Israel also derives from the possibility of 
Korean aid to others developing nuclear weapons and the sale of 
vital components. There can always be a negative precedent, 
especially when so much money is involved. There is no need to 
sell a nuclear bomb, it is sufficient merely to accelerate the 
development stage, and there is surely somebody prepared to pay 
huge amounts for that. North Korea has already made a major 
breakthrough in the field of surface-to-surface missiles (in 
Syria, Iran, and previously in Egypt) and we should not rule out 
the possibility that could also take place in the nuclear field. 
  There is an impression that none of the players, direct or 
indirect, in the Korean crisis want war. They all want to 
achieve their aims without using force, and this includes North 
Korea. South Korea is in a very sensitive position. If war 
breaks out it would be conducted on its soil. The capital Seoul 
is located some 32 km from the border. Some 16 million South 
Koreans live in the northern part of the country and if North 
Korean divisions invade there would be huge damage, and from 
their viewpoint, it does not matter if the North is finally 
defeated. Japan and China also do not want a military solution 
to the crisis. 
  South Korean intelligence says that the Pyongyang regime is 
expected to collapse sooner or later due to the economic crisis 
and the north's isolation from the international community. The 
Americans respond by saying: What would happen if North Korea 
manages to produce nuclear weapons before the downfall of its 
ruler? Will it then be possible to return the nuclear genie back 
into the bottle? It seems that U.S. intelligence nevertheless 
lacks complete information on what the North Koreans have 
already achieved. What they have is the report that the north 
has a certain quantity of plutonium and that tests have already 
been conducted on detonators for nuclear weapons. 
  From Washington's point of view, it is a race against time 
and its tactics toward the crisis are largely derived from that. 
The goal is to achieve the aims as soon as possible without 
sparking a general conflagration. It is clear that North Korea 
is trying to gain time thereby increasing the suspicion that it 
wants to be armed with nuclear weapons should war break out; or, 
it hopes to manage to satisfactorily hide such weapons before it 
is forced to sign the NPT and accept international supervision.

<F P=106> [Article by Yiftah Shafir, a nonconventional weapons </F>
proliferation expert at Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Center for 
Strategic Studies: "A Chinese Slap in the Face of the Clinton 
Administration"] 
  [Text] Ten days ago the PRC conducted a nuclear test at 
the Lop Nor testing facility in northwest China. This was the 
second test conducted by the PRC in less than a year. The 
Chinese test was a slap in the face of President Clinton, who 
only recently retracted his resolute demands from the Chinese 
leaders with regard to arms exports and human rights. 
  The slap in the face is particularly stinging at this point 
in time when the United States is worried about North Korea 
developing a bomb, seeing that without the PRC's agreement and 
assistance it will be impossible to enforce any sanctions 
against North Korea and that nobody knows how to pressure North 
Korea to terminate its nuclear program except through sanctions. 
  The Chinese test is particularly hurtful because preventing 
the proliferation of nuclear weapons is a cornerstone of the 
Clinton Administration's foreign policy. An integral part of 
this policy is the moratorium on nuclear tests and the efforts 
to bring about the signing of an international pact banning such 
tests in 1996. 
  The moratorium began back in November 1992, when the U.S. 
Congress forced a nine-month ban on nuclear tests on President 
Bush's administration. After those nine months, Congress 
permitted only 15 such tests to be conducted until 1996 and 
banned nuclear tests altogether afterward. It was President 
Bush who signed the ban, known as the "Hatfield Amendment." In 
January 1993, the ball was passed to Clinton, who initially 
extended it until September 1994. 
  The moratorium on nuclear testing was accompanied by a 
poignant argument between Congress and the U.S. military 
establishment. The argument used by advocates of nuclear 
testing was the need to maintain the high level of expertise for 
laboratory workers and arms developers. As for the tests 
themselves, it was decided to conduct three tests to check the 
reliability of the weapons and nine tests to increase the safety 
of existing weapons. Another proposal was a compromise to 
satisfy all sides and limited the tests to "small bombs" not 
exceeding one kiloton. 
  However, the opponents ultimately had the upper hand. They 
saw the ban as a trump card in the struggle to prevent the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. What the 
opponents saw was "deranged" countries, which at present include 
Iran and North Korea, with Pakistan, India, and Israel as 
potential candidates. Another reason for the ban was the 
ratification of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) 
scheduled to expire in 1995, at which point the countries will 
meet to discuss its extension and perhaps even to change some of 
its clauses. Tests would put the "nuclear" countries in an 
awkward position when urging other countries to evince restraint. 
  However, for the ban to have the desired effect all the 
nuclear countries have to maintain a united front. Such a front 
existed until the Chinese test last October. With Russia the 
problem is negligible: what could not be achieved in the days 
of the Soviet Union, can easily be attained from Yeltsin, who 
desperately needs all the U.S. support he can get. 
  With Britain the problem is even easier. Although the 
British nuclear establishment wants to go on with the tests and 
the Tory government supports it, the British have a "tiny" 
technical problem: they test their bombs in Nevada, and without 
U.S. permission they can hold no tests. Hence, a problem 
remains with the two "enfants terribles": France and China. 
France has for some time adopted an independent policy, 
inconsiderate of its allies' opinion (not to mention public 
opinion). 
  In spite of all the threats, the Chinese test last October 
did not upset the moratorium and Russia and France did not hold 
any further tests. However, there is no certainty that what 
happened eight months ago will recur today. The global 
moratorium remains a house of cards built on the principle of 
"not-the-first-to-test." Back when the moratorium was extended, 
Clinton ordered the labs "to maintain the ability to resume the 
testing." Yeltsin also ordered his labs to prepare two to four 
nuclear tests, and in recent months Russia has been leaning 
toward an independent policy unconnected to the United States. 
In France, Mitterrand will have a harder time resisting the 
pressure of the Army and the right-wing government to resume the 
tests. 
  The ball is now in Clinton's court. Adherence to the 
moratorium will enable him to come to the NPT deliberations next 
year with a clean record. Pressure on Russia may make Yeltsin 
rein in his nuclear establishment despite his indebtedness to 
the Army and his desperate need to keep employed those nuclear 
scientists who have not yet emigrated, and may also help keep 
France in line. Permission to resume the tests will undoubtedly 
enable the British to test their bombs. France will waste no 
time joining the party, and the price will be paid by the whole 
world in 1995.

  [Text] Dhaka, June 21 (AFP) -- A bomb attack early Tuesday 
[21 June] at the home of a Bangladeshi magazine editor was the 
latest strike in a campaign by Muslim fundamentalists, media 
sources said. Three powerful homemade bombs exploded at the 
gate of the Dhaka home of Shafik Rehman, editor of the popular 
Bengali language weekly JAI JAI DIN, or PASSING DAYS. No one 
was hurt in the blast. 
  Rehman faces a blasphemy charge for publishing a column by 
fugitive feminist doctor-turned-writer Taslima Nasreen, in 
hiding since religious charges were laid against her, and death 
threats made, for criticisms of the Koran. 
  Rehman told AFP in a telephone interview Tuesday that he 
felt 
insecure and held the fundamentalist Jagrata Towhidi Janata, or 
Rising Faithfuls, responsible because the group had threatened 
in a letter to take "appropriate steps" unless his magazine 
stopped publishing Nasreen's column. 
  "These groups are making non-issues an issue because our 
writings are hurting their bread and butter," he said. 
  Nasreen's regular column stopped appearing soon after she 
went into hiding early this month, and Rehman said he would not 
publish them if the opportunity arose because it would be 
"illegal now." 
  Police are still searching for Nasreen, 32, who faces 
charges 
of offending Muslim religious sentiment in an interview with an 
Indian newspaper. Nasreen denies suggesting rewriting the 
Koran, the holy book of Islam. 
  Rehman said the attack was triggered by a report in the 
pro-Islamic Daily INQILAB newspaper that a warrant for his 
arrest for blasphemy was issued Sunday was the reason for the 
attack. The court ordered his arrest after he failed to answer 
several summons and set a hearing for July 17, the Inqilab said. 
Government officials were not available for comment because of 
a national holiday. 
  Local resident Hafiz Abdul Alim charged that Rehman insulted 
religious feeling by comparing two Arabic letters to human 
genitals in his column Day after Day in November 1993. Rehman 
refuted the allegation, saying that the two letters were not 
only used in Urdu and Persian languages, but he used them in a 
joke about international politics without refering to Islam, 
religion or the Koran. 
  JAI JAI DIN was banned by former president Hussain Muhammad 
Ershad's government and Rehman returned from self-exile in 
London after the dictatorial regime's fall in December, 1990. 
  In recent weeks, fundamentalists have attacked other 
newspapers critical of them. Editors have warned Prime Minister 
Khaleda Zia about rising fundamentalism in the predominantly 
Moslem country. Three editors of the mass circulation Bengali 
daily JANAKANTHA newspaper were arrested recently for alleged 
blasphemy. Two were released on bail. Journalist union 
officials said 24 newspapers have been attacked in the past 
three years. 
  Rehman said he held a "a section of the government" 
responsible for the rise in fundamentalism because it had not 
taken any action against the issuers of the death threats on 
Nasreen.

  [Text] Bangladesh has termed as baseless and without any 
foundation a report by the Voice of America [VOA] that 
Bangladesh is planning to establish diplomatic relations with 
Israel ahead of other Muslim countries. Expressing Bangladesh's 
surprise, the Foreign Office spokesman said the news item 
broadcast by VOA is not true. He said Bangladesh is committed 
toward a lasting peace in the Middle East and [word indistinct] 
it works on positive developments in the region.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Longer View"] </F>
  [Text] The Russians have reportedly offered India an 
improved Sukhoy fighter bomber aircraft, an earlier version of 
which -- Su-27 -- has already been supplied to China. The Su-30 
or Su-35 is an advanced version with air-to-air refuelling 
capability with impressive performance characteristics. India 
has had a satisfying experience with Russian aircraft and it is 
therefore natural for Russia, now anxious to earn foreign 
exchange, to offer its latest product to the Indian Air Force 
[IAF]. In the past, the lAF's approach to acquisitions of new 
aircraft have been rather ad hoc; decisions taken to produce 
some categories of aircraft under licence have not resulted in 
actual production and plans for doing so have been abandoned. 
In some other cases, the acquisitions have been in driblets 
with the result that the country has not got the best possible 
terms that could have been obtained if the entire purchase had 
been negotiated in one lot. Therefore, there is a good case now 
to work out a long-term plan for the future composition of the 
IAF over the next 25 years and examine whether the Russian 
Sukhoy offer fits into that scheme. Unlike at the time when the 
Mirage 2000 was purchased, we are not under any immediate threat 
from new acquisitions by Pakistan, which might disturb the 
balance of air power in the sub-continent. No doubt there is 
the possibility of the US sale of F-16s to Pakistan. But that 
alone cannot be allowed to determine the choice of the next 
generation of high performance aircraft into the IAF. 
  It is obvious that new Soviet aircraft will not be available 
on easy terms of credit as earlier. Since India has to pay in 
hard currency there has to be a rigorous cost-benefit evaluation 
of various options and the technology transfer and countertrade 
arrangements that could be available. Some may argue that 
Indian purchases of aircraft will provide a justification to the 
Americans to release F-16s to Pakistan. That argument can be 
turned around. Since there is the threat of a possible US sale 
of F-16s to Pakistan, India should explore all avenues and be 
ready to rectify any imbalance that may be caused by the F-16 
transfer. Arms transfers are highly visible symbols of 
political relationship. In the post-Gorbachev era, Indo-Russian 
ties do not enjoy the same degree of closeness they once did. 
The Sukhoy offer would have to be influenced by the manner in 
which Russia agrees to solve the problem of supply of spares for 
equipment bought in the past. Russia will now have to prove that 
it is a reliable and dependable source of supply of armaments in 
the future.

  [Text] The home minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan, has said that 
the Bodoland accord should be implemented in letter and spirit 
without adversely affecting the interest of any other section. 
Talking to newspersons last night at Guwahati, Mr. Chavan hoped 
that the state government will be able to sort out the 
differences relating to the demarcation of the boundary of the 
Bodoland Autonomous Council. The home minister said there has 
been distinct improvement in the law and order situation in 
Assam. The three-member team of union ministers headed by Mr. 
Chavan met a number of delegations representing various ethnic 
groups of Assam and heard their problems. 
  Mr. Chavan earlier said that Pakistan's Inter Service 
Intelligence, the ISI, had increased its activities in the 
northeast by operating through various militant organizations. 
He said much of it is controlled from ISI's Bangladesh bases. 
He hoped that with the agreement being reached with Bangladesh 
coordinated actions would be taken soon to end ISI activities. 
As reported, Bangladesh had agreed to cooperate in halting ISI 
activities in India. 
  The home minister has since arrived in Arunachal Pradesh's 
capital Itanagar on a two day visit to the state. He is 
accompanied by the minister of state for labor, Mr. P.A. Sangma, 
and the minister of state for personnel, Mrs. Margaret Alwa. 
The three-member team currently on a four-day visit to some of 
the northeastern states will meet the state governor, Mr. 
Prasad; the chief minister, Gegong Apong; and his cabinet 
colleagues and discuss various issues concerning the state.

  [Text] The Janata Dal has split again with 14 members of 
the Lok Sabha deciding to form a new group. They all met the 
speaker in New Delhi today and made a formal request to allot 
them separate seats. The members include, Mr. Rabi Ray, Mr. 
George Fernandes, Mr. Chandrajit Yadav, Mr. Nitish Kumar, Mr. 
Abdul Gafoor, Mr. Harikishore Singh and Syed Shahabuddin. Ten 
of them are from Bihar. 
  At a joint news conference, the MP's claim to represent the 
real Janata Dal. They said following the refusal of Mr. V.P. 
Singh to assume the leadership, the Janata Dal has been without 
a sense of direction. He said there is no option but to split 
in order to revive the party. Leaders of the split group have 
decided to hold a national convention in August to formulate 
their future course of action. Mr. Rabi Ray claimed the support 
of majority of the Janata Dal parliamentary party and its state 
units. He firmly ruled out any of its member joining the 
Congress-I. 
  This is the second split in the Janata Dal after 1991 
general 
elections. In 1992, 20 MP's led by Mr. Ajit Singh broke away 
from the party. Later, 17 of them joined the Congress-I in two 
stages. The rest of the group led by Mr. Rashid Masood merged 
with the Samajwadi Party. The Janata Dal leader and former 
prime minister, Mr. V.P. Singh, has described the split as a 
logical conclusion. He expressed the hope that the new party 
will unite the forces of social justice.

<F P=106> [News conference by King Husayn with unidentified </F>
correspondents in Washington on 21 June -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Husayn] Good morning ladies and gentlemen. It is a 
great pleasure for me to have this opportunity to be with you 
today, and to see many old, and dear and familiar faces. I hope 
that I'll have the chance in the next few minutes to respond to 
any of your questions, and of course to have once again a frank, 
and open dialogue. On behalf of Nur and the Jordanian group 
with me, we would like also to express our delight at seeing you 
all at this hour. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty, perhaps we could begin by, 
first of all, thanking you for spending the time with us, and as 
[words indistinct] a sense of, if you think now that there is 
enough progress made for Jordan to move forward, forging a peace 
treaty with Israel? 
  [Husayn] I believe in response [?to your comments] that we 
are on the verge of beginning the serious negotiations that, 
hopefully, will lead to the establishment of peace between us. 
As you will recall, we ratified the agenda following the great 
event that took place here in Washington on the 
Palestinian-Israeli track, and we have been waiting to commence 
serious negotiations on all aspects of the problems between us 
and Israel, and on all the subjects, topics mentioned in that 
agenda. I believe that a major step was taken when the meetings 
were held here (?last), and I believe it is a very constructive 
moment in the sense that we have decided to move to the area, 
and to commence negotiations there. I would like to say, once 
again, that we were fully convinced that nothing meaningful 
could have been achieved, or could be achieved unless it was 
preceded by serious [words indistinct] of all problems, and that 
the final achievement of all these efforts [words indistinct]. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty, would you tell us about your 
talks in Washington, and your expected meeting with the 
President tomorrow. What you have achieved, what do you have to 
achieve, actually, from your dialogue with the American 
administration? 
  [Husayn] As you would probably realize, I am here in the 
United States, in Washington in particular, following my visit 
to Rochester and to the Mayo clinic where I am pleased to say 
that I was given a clean bill of health. There was no evidence 
of cancer after two years from surgery and, therefore, hopefully 
my visits to Mayo will be on an annual basis from now on. But, 
I could not have been in the United States, and not be here in 
Washington, particularly at such an important and exciting time 
regarding developments in our region. So, I have had talks with 
the secretary of state yesterday, and I look forward to my 
meeting with the President, tomorrow, and in the meantime, there 
are other meetings scheduled. And whenever we meet, we meet to 
discuss all aspects of our bilateral relations and regional 
matters, and the cooperation that we hope will grow in the times 
ahead between our two countries. 
  [Correspondent] This is a question about coordination 
between the Arab parties to the peace process. You visited 
President al-Asad recently. Shortly after, there was progress 
on the Jordan-Israel track. But, there has been some criticism, 
(?of course) from Syria that Jordan is moving too fast. Could 
you say something about the coordination with Syria, and how the 
timing of the progress can go forward, how fast can Jordan move 
If Syria is not moving, and also on the question of 
Palestinian-Jordanian cooperation, when I was recently in Amman, 
I heard a word used often, frequently, even from Palestinians 
living on the East Bank, that I hadn't heard in a while, and the 
word was federation, and I heard it used quite frequently. I 
wonder if you could say something about when the issue of the 
future relationship between the Palestinians and the Jordanians 
has to be addressed again? 
  [Husayn] Well, to begin with, I think I'll address the 
second 
part of our question regarding the future relationship between 
Jordan and our Palestinian brothers on Palestinian soil. I 
believe that it is premature to speculate as to what form it 
will take. I am sure it will be a very close relationship, and 
I am sure that, in time when conditions are ripe, people under 
conditions of total freedom can work together to define that 
relationship. This hasn't happened so far. So, it is 
premature to really define the way these relations will be 
formulated. But, as far as your question regarding the peace 
process, we started at the same point in time, and, I believe 
that as far as Amman and Damascus are concerned, we have always 
been in touch, and in terms of matters relating to policy, this 
has been discussed time and again between me and the president 
of Syria, President al-Asad. So, my visit there was, naturally, 
within that context, and we were negotiating, they were 
negotiating there. I hope that, eventually, all these tracks 
will see active movement toward the objective of having a 
comprehensive peace in the region. But, as far as we are 
concerned, we will be as fast, or as slow as we are able to 
achieve real progress in resolving all the problems that are 
there on the agenda, and between us and Israel, and I hope that 
they will approach the coming negotiations with a constructive 
serious [word indistinct] for we will move rapidly. I can't 
set a time or.. I really don't know. But, I really hope that we 
will see rapid progress in that regard. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty on this question. You said 
that you discussed this matter with Mr. al-Asad. Does this mean 
that you discussed the agreement that you had with the Americans 
[word indistinct] and why are serious [words indistinct] 
Jordanians left them alone? 
  [Husayn] Well, I think that it seems to happen, we seem to 
find every now and then that someone complains about another 
leaving him alone, but this hasn't happened at the very level I 
was discussing. I believe that President al-Asad and I 
understand each other very very well. I know of his concern to 
see Syria move towards achieving the kind of peace that it can 
live with, and that he knows that we are doing the same. So, in 
the area of coordination I'd like to say there has never been 
the kind of coordination that will enable us to know exactly 
where any track is at any given movement. We have our own 
peculiar set of circumstances and problems that we try to 
address, and the Syrians have the same, as do the Lebanese, our 
brethren. Therefore, movement as far as we concerned is a 
question of a sovereign matter regarding Jordan itself and there 
is nothing to do nor is it tied to movement on other track. We 
hope that they will catch us, and may be they will overtake us 
in time if they so desire, but that is something which we can't 
control. Its something that they can control. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty, [words indistinct] trip, was 
reported that you and President al-Asad suggested [word 
indistinct] unity Jordan and Syria. Will [words indistinct] 
Syrian idea [words indistinct] 
  [Husayn] No sir, we have always worked for complementarity 
and the closest possible cooperation between Jordan and Syria, 
and Lebanon, hopefully, and certainly with Egypt, and there was 
a meeting of a prime ministerial commission with Egypt that was 
revived again just a short while ago, and in the same context, 
there was going to be a meeting with Syria. So, this was 
postponed, but essentially this would have dealt with issues 
other than the political ones that usually are dealt with 
between me and my brother President al-Asad. 
  [Correspondent] Your highness, on your talks with the 
Americans. Did you make any headway on the request to resell 
[words indistinct] and also your request to purchase additional 
American military equipment, and lastly finalizing the 
arrangements for the land-based inspection system [words 
indistinct] naval blockade the Gulf of Aqaba? 
  [Husayn] I haven't had the chance to cover all these points 
with any detail, but we are, as Jordan is concerned looking at 
the moment that the present situation and the future, in terms 
of, hopefully, reorganization of our armed forces to meet the 
challenges and the demands of the coming period, both in terms 
of the defense of Jordan and also in terms of the role that we 
play on the international arena, particularly in the area of 
troops that are with the United Nations, and have beeen over a 
period of time. So we have ideas and plans, and we hope that we 
will be able discuss them with our friends to modernize and 
reorganize our armed forces in times ahead. 
  [Correspondent] So this time you'll be discussing mainly 
[words indistinct]? 
  [Husayn] I am not discussing anything in particular. I am 
just giving you an idea of where we are at the moment. We 
haven't formulated our plans totally, but obviously we discuss 
our requirements with our friends from time to time. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty, [words indistinct]. 
  [Husayn] This is not something that is one of [word 
indistinct] replace in the future, then we'll have to see what 
we replace them with and what we do with them. But this is 
something that I am not prepared to answer at this stage. It is 
something that we will be discussing with our friends in the 
times ahead. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty [word indistinct] the peace 
process. At this stage, do you think it is reversible, 
particularly in terms of circumstances, such as, for example, 
the Likud taking over the Israeli government. In such 
circumstances, do you think it could, the clock, be turned back 
to where the Middle East was three years ago? 
  [Husayn] I certainly hope not, and I believe that the 
process is irreversible and we are certainly committed to moving 
ahead towards the establishment of a just, comprehensive peace 
in that region. This is something that we feel we are close to, 
but it's [word indistinct] to require the best efforts of all 
concerned. We are looking forward to seeing some rapid progress 
on the Jordanian-Israeli track and we hope that this will be the 
case with the other tracks as well. 
  [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] that the Americans could 
be doing right now to further the peace process? 
  [Husayn] They have been involved with the process. They 
have sponsored the process. They have, I am sure, helped us 
very, very much indeed to get to this point and I hope that 
their involvement will continue in the times ahead. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty, how do you foresee Jordan's 
relations with Israel after an agreement is signed? Do you 
think it will be [word indistinct] for Jordanians in terms of 
economic and [word indistinct]? 
  [Husayn] As far as that goes, I believe, obviously, that if 
we arrive at a state of peace, it would be a change of 
everything that we've had to live with and endure over many, 
many years. It will be to the benefit of people in both Jordan 
and in Israel and in the whole region, particularly if the 
circle is enlarged to include all involved in the conflict so 
far. As far as we're concerned, these coming negotiations, and 
why in place there are, as you know, within the areas of grave 
concern for us are territorial rights. [sentence as heard] The 
border between us and Israel is not clearly settled yet, in 
terms of an issue that is very, very important to us to regain 
our sovereignty over the areas that are occupied by Israel in 
southern Jordan at this stage. So the question of border 
demarcation and delineation is very, very important, not to 
create a new barrier, but in the context of movement towards 
peace. We hope that the Rift Valley, the valley itself, will 
become the valley of peace, the valley of opportunities for 
cooperation in many fields and many areas. 
  Another area, of course, is of importance to us, and that is 
the question of water and our rights and our share in that. 
Plus the environment, plus all the other subjects that have to 
be discussed. So what we are trying to do right now is hopefully 
approach a serious phase of negotiations to resolve all these 
problems. [Words indistinct] the quality of life of people, 
affect them in terms of their hopes and aspirations and the 
opportunities that will be the resultant fact of all these 
efforts which have been ongoing so far. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty, you mentioned moving quickly 
between Jordan and Israel, and that there is no link between the 
Jordanian track and the other tracks. When you finish the 
negotiations on the agenda, would you be ready to sign, even if 
the other tracks are not progressing? 
  [Husayn] Our position on that is not linked to anything that 
may or may not happen on any other track. What I am saying is 
that what we are searching for is a comprehensive peace, and 
therefore one would obviously stress the need for progress on 
all tracks so that we achieve this comprehensive peace. For 
example, in regard to Jordanian-Palestinian relations in times 
ahead, we in Jordan will continue to respond to any demand for 
help in any particular area, but, let us say we take the area of 
economic dimensions, the economy as between us and our 
Palestinian brethren and Israel. If coordination has not 
achieved very much, then obviously we have to negotiate this 
subject as Jordan, together with the Palestinians, and the 
Israelis in the times ahead. In other words there are bilateral 
negotiations and trilateral negotiations, and there are going to 
be quadrilateral negotiations with regard to Egypt, for example, 
in terms of the return of Palestinians to the occupied 
territories. 
  You can't resolve the question of water without, hopefully, 
seeing progress everywhere. But, the point is our wishes for 
progress to be achieved on all tracks. However, we are a 
sovereign country, we are dealing with our own problems, we 
started at the same point and we are trying to see what we can 
achieve. Whether we will or not does not depend on any other 
factor, other than Israel's coming through with the same kind of 
spirit and our mutually reaching a satisfactory conclusion to 
the differences between us as settling all the items of the 
agenda. 
  [Correspondent] Will we see a peace treaty this year, Your 
Majesty? 
  [Husayn] I can't tell you that, I can't tell you that. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty, you were quoted yesterday as 
saying that you would agree to talk to Israeli leaders, as you 
have indicated in the past. Today, they are responding, saying 
they would like to meet with you. Do you foresee that this 
peace process, the talks beginning next month, would lead to or 
conclude in some, finally, a public meeting between you and 
Israeli leaders? 
  [Husayn] Whenever the time is ripe, whenever there is a need 
to, I welcome that, there is no problem with that at all. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty, can you confirm for us whether 
you saw the Israeli leadership, please? 
  [Husayn] I am not going to comment on press speculation in 
that regard, or media speculation, one way or the other. I 
think you have had their answer, so this is my answer, too. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty, [words indistinct] concerning 
the Syrian criticism, directly or indirectly, after ... 
  [Husayn, interrupting] Let me ask a question myself, to all 
of you: Is Jordan expected to be the last to ratify a peace 
treaty? 
  [Correspondent] I thought everybody would sign it within the 
same timeframe? 
  [Husayn] Inshallah, inshallah, that is what we hope will 
happen. But to get there we have to begin negotiating and this 
is precisely what we are doing. So I hope that these serious 
negotiations will achieve some results. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty, will you explain please, and 
shed some light, what made you feel that this was the right 
moment to go forward on the road that eventually will end in a 
peace? 
  [Husayn] That was not our doing. But, I think [word 
indistinct] suggested since the outset that we have to translate 
the items on the agenda into realities by negotiating over them, 
and that a peace treaty is a crowning achievement of resolving 
all the problems. So we have been waiting, but when the 
Israelis were ready to begin I think we have seen some progress. 
It was not anything that was a result of our hesitation or an 
attempt to avoid the issue. 
  [Correspondent] I mean, were there any historical moments 
you thought that this is the right moment to go for? 
  [Husayn] Not at all, sir. We weren't playing tactics. We 
were waiting and ready, and the moment has arrived, so we were 
beginning to (?work out). 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty: You mentioned something about 
the water rights which the Israelis have been denying, refusing 
to discuss water rights before, and finally they did this 
Washington [word indistinct]. Did this Washington [words 
indistinct] contribute to making progress on the Jordanian 
track? You went back to the beginning of the establishment of 
Israel. From 1948 to 1951, Israel received 600,000 immigrants 
and this caused a serious water shortage in Israel. As a 
result, Israel started to divert Jordan River in the whole 
sequence of events that (?led to the) June 1967 War. Are you 
concerned now about the wave of immigration coming from Russia, 
that [word indistinct] more than 430,000 already arrived on the 
ground in Israel? This is, apparently, causing a serious threat 
and shortage of water in Israel itself. Are you concerned that 
you'll be... [pauses] do you see that this one is one of the 
reasons for, maybe, the Israeli moves toward peace, and do you 
see a new threat on the Arab waters because of the new 
immigration? 
  [Husayn] I hope that the question of water resources 
available in the region will be resolved to the satisfaction of 
all. But, on the other hand, I would like to say that it's my 
feeling that before too long even all these resources that are 
available will not be enough to meet the demands and the needs 
of all. So, water is a very, very important subject, an 
important need for everyone in the region. And, that again is a 
reason for us to move ahead, because amongst the many reasons, 
we have to resolve this problem that could be very explosive 
unless resolved, and cannot be resolved except in the context of 
peace. 
  [Correspondent] The Israelis, Your Majesty, are suggesting 
that as the [word indistinct] under the Johnston Plan, I think, 
they have indeed received more water than they were allotted to, 
or that they've stolen, if you want to use the word, more water. 
Has that been communicated to you, that there is going to be an 
arrangement under which large quantities of water are restored 
to Jordan? 
  [Husayn] I certainly hope that we will receive our share and 
that this will be defined in the coming negotiations, sir. 
  [Correspondent] But, sir, If I can just ask you another 
question. I know you can't speak for the Syrian leadership. 
But from your talks in Damascus, do you have any sense of what 
the major problem is now for the Syrians. There seems to be, as 
you know, Secretary Christopher has put off his trip to the 
region because he was not convinced that it will produce 
progress on the Syrian- Israeli track. Do you have any thoughts 
about what may be required either from the Israelis or from the 
Syrians to try to produce progress? 
  [Husayn] My impression is that progress was made, and that 
certainly, reflects my impression of the Syrian position that 
they would like to get on with it as rapidly as possible and 
arrive at a satisfactory conclusion to these talks. I think 
that positions were set out, and they probably are starting 
positions at this stage, but I hope that on both sides there 
will be an effort to achieve progress, and I hope that we will 
see that happening in the time ahead. It is not for me to 
comment on when the secretary will visit, but I think that 
further progress is expected before too long. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty, on the question of Jerusalem, 
it seems no one is talking about Jerusalem any more. Is 
Jerusalem going to be just a Palestinian-Israeli issue, 
especially that the Palestinians will not have any leverage 
on....? 
  [Husayn, interrupting] Not in the least, not in the least. 
The agenda [words indistinct] that. I don't know, maybe you 
have not been hearing us. I think that we've been talking about 
Jerusalem continuously and our feelings for Jerusalem have never 
changed, will never change. And, again, the idea that we are 
trying to put across is that we should, somehow, find a way by 
which we can address the problem in terms of the holy sites, 
holy to the followers of the three great monotheistic religions, 
the three great Ibrahmic religions, to remove those away from 
the realm of politics and politicking. And we recognize no 
sovereignty over these holy places except to God. 
  We hope that in a state of peace, these places will come to 
symbolize peace between the followers of the three great 
religions. And, as far as the rest is concerned, I believe 242 
applies to that side of the equation, and I am sure that future 
negotiations, we understand, will deal with them. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty, permit me to ask about Yemen, 
mainly. It is another subject, but still you have a position 
and your position is very well known concerning Yemen. Now we 
have reached this phase of problem where there is actually war 
and there is no cease-fire. What is the Jordanian position, 
what is your position, Your Majesty, on this problem? 
  [Husayn] Sir, our position is one of deep regret over seeing 
the situation in Yemen develop to the point of war and military 
action. We regret the losses, those who have been lost in terms 
of the ongoing struggle and those who have suffered and those 
who continue to face a threat within Yemen. We had tried our 
utmost to help all Yemenis achieve an understanding of how the 
state of Yemen will be formulated in the future. And they have 
reached an agreement, which they ratified, representatives of 
all schools of political thought and representatives of all the 
people of Yemen, in Amman. Unfortunately, it did not last long 
and the situation has erupted. Naturally, it would be our wish 
and hope that the unity of Yemen could be maintained. But I am 
very concerned and very, very worried that even that might be in 
jeopardy at this stage. I hope, somehow, that the situation 
will improve and that what is in the interest of Yemen will be 
in the forefront of the thoughts of all concerned. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty, you've said that, getting back 
to the face-to-face meeting with the Israeli leadership, you've 
said that [word indistinct] must wait [words indistinct] until 
the time is right. The Israeli leadership has been using 
similar language. What is the sequence of provisional 
agreements, on various issues, that must be achieved before time 
is right for a face-to-face meeting, or is it necessary to wait 
until all agreements are (?agreed)...? 
  [Husayn, interrupting] Sir, let's put it in another way. I 
think that it's fair to describe the situation in the following 
way. We are negotiating. Negotiations are taking place. 
Negotiations are going to take place. So, whether they are at 
my level and the prime minister, or at the level of our 
representatives at this stage, one and the same thing. The 
question of exactly when we will meet, hopefully, we'll see some 
progress before that happens. But the fact that we haven't met 
publicly does not mean that the efforts of our colleagues and 
those who represent both countries are not a reflection of the 
spirit and the desire to negotiate between the two, as is 
happening. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty, regarding the venue for such a 
conference, such a meeting within the area, will it also be in 
the region [words indistinct]? 
  [Husayn] It could be. Why not? 
  [Correspondent] It could be in the region? 
  [Husayn] It could be, I suppose. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty, just to clear up one thing. 
Are you drawing a distinction between the starting of 
negotiations with the Israelis and the signing of the agreement, 
because sometimes we are putting them together? 
  [Husayn] I think, sir, that this is a problem in the minds 
of 
many. I mean, obviously, it is a very important moment and we 
are starting serious negotiations at this stage. Hopefully with 
good will and with a determination to achieve progress and 
resolve all problems. That doesn't mean we have ratified peace 
yet. But when we reach satisfaction on all the problems, when 
we've resolved all these problems, then, obviously, we will be 
at the state where the crowning achievement, as I've said time 
and again, is a peace treaty. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty, have you detected any 
flexibility in the American position on sanctions on Iraq? Is 
there any change in the American position? 
  [Husayn] I do not care to comment on that, sir. I haven't... 
[pauses] anything that I would say would be out of place, I 
think. 
  [Correspondent] Could I just follow that up, Your Majesty, 
on 
Iraq. There is an agreement between Jordan, an economic 
agreement between Jordan and the PLO to provide oil to the Gaza 
and Jericho, the self-rule areas. Jordan gets about 60,000 
barrels a day of oil from Iraq. Presumably, if Jordan is going 
to provide oil to those areas, it is going to be Iraqi oil, and 
it is going to come from the oil that you need for your country. 
Doesn't that create an incentive for you, and indeed for the 
West in general, to relook at the sanctions, and perhaps provide 
some relief for the Iraqis to, at least, provide some oil, or 
greater quantities of oil. 
  [Jordanian Prime Minister al-Majali, whispering to King 
Husayn, in Arabic, after Husayn queries him] There is an 
agreement between Israel and Egypt, and we have nothing to do 
with that. 
  [Husayn] We have not yet concluded an agreement, sir, with 
our Palestinian brethren to provide oil from Jordan. And as you 
do suggest, I was just asking if there is anything new that has 
happened while I was away. But, I don't think that anything 
has, in that regard. But, regarding Iraq, I continue to feel 
very, very strongly with the people of Iraq. And I hope that 
the rest of the world will share with us these feelings that the 
impact, the suffering of the people of Iraq is really out of 
proportion to all (?reason). Regardless of who is responsible, 
regardless of who caused it, and regardless of [as heard], we 
are interested obviously in the humanitarian dimension; and Iraq 
is an important element in our region. So, let us hope that 
this nightmare somehow comes to an end before too long. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty, (?could you say something 
about) the demarcation of borders between you and Israel? 
[Words indistinct] does Jordan want this to be the first thing 
on the agenda? Do you think it will be a problem with the 
Israelis, because they always reject... 
  [Husayn, interrupting] I hope that it will not be a problem. 
And I hope that... [pauses] I think that we are going to meet 
face to face. I am sure the Americans will be present and most 
welcome at this stage. And as far as we are concerned, 
obviously the question of sovereignty over our territories is 
one that has to be resolved. And as I have said earlier, by 
that, I don't mean that we should create a new barrier between 
us. But, we have to recover our territory, we have to recover 
our water rights. Let me put it another way. To those who ask 
so many questions about Jordan and Jordan's actions and why, I 
think no country in the Arab world has done more for the 
Palestinian cause, or identified more with the suffering of the 
Palestinian people, or their hopes and aspirations of regaining 
their rights on their soil. No Arab country has done more for 
Arab unity, and cooperation, and coordination. We paid a very 
heavy price in 1967, because we lived up to our commitments as 
members of the Arab League, and we respected our agreements in 
terms of the joint defense dimension within the Arab world. We 
knew fully well what the results might be. Yet, we lived up to 
our commitments, and we endured all the results, as hard as they 
have been. Later, we saw Egypt move on its own, too -- and it 
was our leader, obviously, in that period, in the 1967 period -- 
and achieve a peace treaty with Israel, and a situation of peace 
with Israel. We have done our best to move the Palestinian 
dimension forward. And suddenly, we saw our Palestinian brethren 
move, and they are the people most immediately concerned, and 
(?our concern) and achieve progress there. In this situation, 
we feel that nobody has the right to ask us what to do, and we 
have a responsibility toward ourselves, toward our country, 
toward our lands, toward our rights, to do whatever we can to 
move and safeguard our interests; and that is what we are doing, 
precisely. So, I hope that we will see progress on every other 
track, and we will see eventually the coming together of the 
comprehensive peace in the region. But, we are aware of our 
responsibilities towards our people, and we are carrying them 
out. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty, can I ask you to step back 
from the daily news events, to look at the broader issue of 
democracy in the Middle East. Your kingdom has taken strides, 
but in most of the Arab world there is little or no movement, 
and in other places where it has been tried, there are 
breakdowns, in Yemen and Algeria. Could you reflect, for us, 
for a minute, on the prospects for democracy in the Arab world 
and the challenges that lie ahead? 
  [Husayn] As far as I am concerned, and many may or may not 
agree with me, democracy, pluralism, respect for human rights is 
the only way, is the best way. I hope that we have demonstrated 
that in Jordan that we will continue to do so in the times ahead 
and there is nothing more important than for people to feel that 
they are something, that they mean something, that they have 
rights to share in shaping their future. And I hope that Jordan 
will be a good example to others in that regard and in that 
respect. I believe when institutions are established, they are 
also a guarantee for continuity, for stability in the entire 
region. So we cannot claim to have the right to speak for 
others or advise others what to do, but as far as we are 
concerned, democracy, pluralism, respect for human rights, is a 
part of our very existence, and will continue to be always. 
  [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] experiments in Algeria 
and 
Yemen have been so unsuccessful so far, very discouraging to 
people who would like to support democracy in the Arab world? 
  [Husayn] Well, regarding Yemen, unfortunately, again, I 
didn't cover the answer in any great detail, but when one sees 
this ongoing struggle one is really puzzled because the unity 
was not created by force. The unity came as a result of the 
people of Yemen electing to have that unity come to be. There 
was a plebiscite, there was a formation of unity within the 
country, there was an election for a parliament, there was an 
election of a president, there was creation of something new, 
and suddenly we see it falling apart. Obviously what is in my 
heart is a wish that if there is any meaning to all these 
terrible losses that have occurred, that at least that is 
preserved somehow, and that dialogue will result in a solution 
to these problems. We have been involved in the problem to the 
best of our ability. We have tried to create bridges and a 
solid foundation for progress but that, in terms of the 
realities of the matter, required a political will at the very 
highest levels that maybe was not always there, and therefore it 
has failed. And I hope that somehow the Yemenis can pull it 
together, so that it is not a question of north and south but 
union for those who are opposed to it, and those who are opposed 
to it, I hope, will be a minority. But who can tell? I really 
can't tell what will happen. 
  [Correspondent] Concerning the confrontation, Your 
Excellency, the confrontation countries which are supposed to be 
meeting before any resumption of talks, has this formula ended 
now forever; that Jordan, Syria, PLO, and Lebanon meet with each 
other? Has it ended? 
  [Husayn] It hasn't necessarily ended, but here again, let me 
remind you that we were the people who are pushing for that more 
than any, and for coordination more than any. But the realities 
of the matter are that, maybe, we haven't all risen to the level 
that is needed to create the kind of coordination that could 
have been. Nonetheless, we are in touch and we hope that the 
results of our continued efforts, all of us, will enable us to 
achieve greater harmony and help each other in the times ahead. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty, could you clarify one thing I 
am still a little confused about. You said at one point that a 
meeting with the Israeli leadership, and presumably Prime 
Minister Rabin, would be the natural outgrowth of negotiations 
with Israel that are about to resume in a week; that the 
negotiations could take place at any level, foreign minister, 
any level. At another point you said that a peace treaty was 
the crowning, will be, the crowning achievement of these 
negotiations. Is it possible that a meeting between yourself 
and Prime Minister Rabin may take place before a peace treaty is 
signed? 
  [Husayn] It is a very possible, anything is possible, sir. 
(?I am) quite flexible in that regard. But at the moment, there 
is a mechanism for negotiations and they are ongoing, and if and 
when there is a reason perceived by us, or by the Israelis, or 
jointly, for us to meet, then we will meet. It is not a taboo. 
There is nothing that will prevent that. And I hope it will 
come before too long. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty, on boycott, how can Jordan 
implement all [words indistinct]? 
  [Husayn] Anyway, this is something that has to be discussed 
as well and resolved in the negotiations that will come. 
  [Correspondent] With Israel, not within the Arab world? 
  [Husayn] Within the Arab world! Do you think there is any 
boycott left? 
  [Correspondent] I mean the direct boycott. 
  [Husayn, amid laughter] (?No, no, no.) 
  [Correspondent] Since the announcement was made of the 
rapprochement between you and Israel last week, have you been in 
contact with any of the Gulf Arab countries, specifically Saudi 
Arabia, and shall we hope for a warming of the relationship 
between these two countries? 
  [Husayn] I haven't been in touch with any, apart from the 
normal contacts that we have with some of our brethren there. 
No, nothing else has happened. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty, is there a better world 
understanding of Jordan's position during the Gulf War than 
before? And how will that help in enhancing Jordan's relations 
with the world? 
  [Husayn] I believe here there is a better understanding, 
yes, of Jordan's position during the Gulf War, and in the rest 
of the world that is also a fact. And I hope that our position 
will be understood for what it really was and what it really has 
been throughout that very dark moment, and it will always be. 
We have our own positions that we adopt as a result of what we 
believe is in the best interest of all. And our concerns for 
the region were real. And I think that they have been 
justified. We tried to prevent a war, we tried to reverse 
occupation peacefully. There was nothing wrong with that. 
Unfortunately, the problem is with some of our brethren who 
still believe that we knew that Kuwait was going to be attacked, 
that we were a party to a plan, allegedly, to create that 
eruption in that area, and this is totally false. And I wish to 
God that somebody will be able to come out and talk to us about 
it in any detail. We know where we are. We know where we were. 
So, somehow this problem has got to be addressed. It hasn't 
been, so far. We haven't been able to deal with it 
satisfactorily. And it would be in the interest of all to come 
out with [words indistinct] and find exactly what happened, who 
was responsible for concocting such an idea, to avoid falling 
into such pitfalls in the future. We have done everything on 
our side. We've indicated time and again that any step toward 
us will be met by two from us. But beyond that, we can't do 
more. So, we'll have to wait and see and in time, I hope that, 
things will move in the right direction. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty, have there been any contacts 
with Egypt also regarding the progress as far as peace is 
concerned with Israel, any contacts with Cairo? 
  [Husayn] No contacts. In the sense of what context? 
  [Correspondent] I mean to apprise them of what is happening, 
just as Israel does, just as the Palestinians do, in that sense. 
  [Husayn] This happens normally, sir, it happens normally, 
but, have I talked to President Mubarak in the last period? 
This hasn't happened. I talked to him a while ago, around the 
'Id time [21 May] but nothing (?came of it). 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty, you said you meet, as you 
said, 
you meet frequently with President al-Asad, and you said, if I 
understood you correctly, that you understand each other's 
positions. Does that mean that should you meet with Prime 
Minister Rabin in the course of negotiations, when you thought 
the time was ripe, that you would assume that President al-Asad 
would understand that and there would not be any worsening of 
relations between... 
  [Husayn, interrupting] I don't think that there is any 
reason 
for the worsening of relations. There is every reason for the 
improvement of relations, and I hope that this will be a fact. 
I haven't heard from President al-Asad anything to the 
contrary. So, whatever has been said in that regard, I do not 
really consider to be all that important. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty, would you describe the state 
of 
the Jordanian economy? 
  [Husayn] It is passing through a difficult phase. I think we 
have done a lot in the recent past, but we are carrying a very, 
very heavy burden, and I hope somehow that all the efforts will 
result in some improvement in terms of the Jordanian economy in 
the future, that all the opportunities that will be there would 
enable us to move ahead so that they will bring about a change 
in the quality of life of our people and meet their demands and 
needs and expectations regarding the future. 
  [Correspondent] What would a peace do [words indistinct]? 
  [Husayn] I think it will enhance these possibilities, but 
obviously we are passing through a moment where we hope that we 
will get support from a lot of friends throughout the world, 
including our friends here in the United States. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty, there were so many reports 
about invitations for you to visit Jerusalem. Do you think you 
will visit Jerusalem even before the final status and 
negotiations are over, if you sign a treaty with Israel? 
  [Husayn] I think that there is a lot of speculation that is 
way ahead of what is realistic. So I can't say anything in that 
regard. It is obviously my hope as a Hashemite and a Muslim 
Arab, and as a Jordanian, that conditions will permit me to 
visit the holy places in Jerusalem when it is possible for me 
and for others, in a context of peace, where these holy places 
are respected by all of us and there are sacred to all of us and 
were [pauses]... sovereignty is that of the almighty God on all 
of them. I hope that I will be able to visit Jerusalem, yes. I 
hope it will not be long before that happens. 
  [Correspondent] Yes, may I ask, with Syria and Lebanon, like 
did you exchange any information after the agreement with 
Israel, and what is really (?it), because we cannot define 
exactly Syria and Lebanese positions at this stage? 
  [Husayn] I don't know, but I can tell you one thing. We have 
never, so far as I am concerned, up to this moment, been able to 
sit together with any of our Arab brethren and discuss 
everything in detail. They have their own problems, and we 
don't know about them until after the fact, and we have our own 
problems which we deal with. But in terms of a direction for 
peace, this is something that is (?universal) in terms of our 
determination to achieve it and I hope we will see progress to 
arrive at [sentence incomplete]

<F P=106> [Report by Randah Habib from Amman] </F>
  [Excerpt] An official meeting -- the first of its kind -- 
between Jordan's King Husayn and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin may be convened when the two sides sign a border 
demarcation agreement, expected to be wrapped up by 1 October, 
1994. 
  King Husayn has often said that any official sessions with 
Israeli leaders should not be a media show, but must be the 
result of political forward movement. Hence, King Husayn's 
rejection in January of an American proposal for a meeting with 
Rabin at the White House before the peace negotiations achieved 
a breakthrough. However, the progress achieved in Washington 7 
June when Jordan secured Israel's approval of a joint experts 
committee -- set to meet next month in the region to delineate 
joint borders -- broke the deadlock and paved the way for 
Jordanian-Israeli talks at the highest levels. [passage

<F P=106> [Article by Nabil 'Amr] </F>
  [Excerpts] A senior Palestinian official has told AL-DUSTUR 
that Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat will visit Jordan at 
the end of this month, prior to his return to Palestine. During 
'Arafat's visit, the Palestinian official said, 
Jordanian-Palestinian meetings will be held on the highest 
level, and the Jordanian-Palestinian agreement will be signed. 
The signing of the agreement has been postponed several times. 
  The official, who requested anonymity, said that the next 
Jordanian-Palestinian meetings will be extremely important, as 
conferees will discuss a Jordanian-Palestinian mechanism of 
action that is much more exhaustive than coordination. The 
official added that the Palestinian self-rule authority, which 
is the first Palestinian experience of its kind, needs an Arab 
effort to strengthen it and to protect it from the Israeli side, 
which is superior in terms of its economy, scientific knowledge, 
and technology. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, the same Palestinian official revealed a 
Palestinian's wish to reassess the Palestinian-Israeli 
agreement. He indicated that this agreement has only been 
initialed, and that the Palestinian side is not committed to 
implementing it if it harms the Palestinian people or will harm 
Jordanian-Palestinian economic relations, which are viewed by 
the Palestinians of the West Bank as the core of their 
Arab-Islamic extension. 
  He said that all the agreements that have been signed with 
Israel are temporary, since there are Palestinian rights that 
must be addressed and numerous topics of negotiations that must 
raised with Israel prior to the final peace accord. He said 
that this requires everyone to be careful when raising issues of 
a pan-Arab dimension and that Jordanian-Palestinian efforts 
should be united to safeguard these issues, chiefly the issue of 
Jerusalem, which should be the focus of Arab and Islamic 
efforts, rather than Jordanian and Palestinian efforts only.

  [Text] Athens, June 21, IRNA -- The Ikhwan al-Muslimun 
(Muslim Brotherhood), the Arab world's strongest Islamic 
movement, has denounced the Mashhad bomb attack as a "criminal 
act" and expressed its grief over the large number of pilgrims 
who fell martyrs to the cowardly and inhuman act. 
  "This is a criminal act. We are deeply distressed. We 
severely denounce it and express our condolences to the Iranian 
leadership and to the Iranian people," Ikhwan spokesman Ma'mun 
al-Hudaybi told IRNA speaking by phone from Cairo Tuesday [21 
June]. 
  "We pray to allah to protect the Islamic lands from criminal 
acts and to bestow on them peace and security," he added. 
  At least 25 people were martyred and scores of others, 
including children, were injured in a terrorist bomb blast which 
ripped through the holy shrine of Imam Reza (peace be upon him) 
in Mashhad Monday.

Form Committee To Develop Relations"] 
  [Text] Cairo, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Cairo is currently 
studying a proposal submitted by Tehran to form a bilateral 
committee at experts level to hold regular meetings in both 
capitals within continued mechanisms to improve relations 
between the two countries. Well-informed sources in Cairo have 
told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that Egypt and Iran have agreed to 
prepare a view of how to develop and improve bilateral relations 
to avert the eruption of any new disputes between them. 
  The sources said that Egypt told Iran of the necessity to 
stop its support for extremist Egyptian groups and not to 
shelter fugitive elements, especially after Pakistan has 
expelled these elements from its territory and in view of their 
intention to reside in Iran, according to information available 
to Egyptian security services. 
  The sources pointed out that Iran has expressed willingness 
to establish ties of security cooperation between the two 
countries in various security fields, including combating 
terrorism.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: These days, Israeli officials are 
stepping up their statements on the peace process and are urging 
Syria to speed up the peace talks before the U.S. administration 
halts its efforts to push the talks forward due to its numerous 
other international preoccupations. What is strange in these 
statements is that Israel is speaking for the United States and 
its officials in order to put pressure on Syria on behalf of the 
United States. Has President Clinton's administration authorized 
Israeli officials to speak for it about the peace process, or 
are the Tel Aviv rulers trying to hint that time is moving 
quickly and that Syria should catch the train of unilateral 
deals to bring about peace before it misses both the train and 
the fruits of these deals? 
  Speaking about Warren Christopher's time limits, Itamar 
Rabinovich, Israeli ambassador in Washington and head of the 
Israeli negotiating team with Syria, has warned that everyone 
should know that the opportunity is limited. Ambassador 
Rabinovich's statement is not the first nor the last of its 
kind. Israeli officials make proposals every day that have 
nothing to do with the bases of the peace process. Sometimes 
they demand that the level of the talks be promoted and at other 
times they declare that they want to know the nature of the 
peace Syria will give to them or they allege Syria is not 
serious in its talk about peace. In all cases, however, they 
stress they will not withdraw from the Golan Heights, although 
they have voiced their readiness to carry out some kind of 
withdrawal from the Golan Heights--a withdrawal that will not 
end the Israeli occupation or return the rights and the land to 
their rightful owners. 
  Its threats that the opportunity is limited and that time is 
short shows the true Israeli positions and the nature of 
Israel's intentions. The Israeli officials, who have wasted a 
great deal of time in futile talks over more than two and half 
years, are trying to use the same weapon of time against Syria 
to embarrass it in the international arena and portray it as the 
side that is hampering the peace process. These officials are 
mistaken if they believe that such attempts may succeed in 
making Syria enter into the trap of unilateral deals, as they 
succeeded with some sides, in order not to appear as an obstacle 
on the way to peace. 
  These attempts will not affect Syria's known position and 
cannot mislead the world public opinion, which knows the true 
situation in the region, as well those who are placing obstacles 
on the way to peace. Syria has always asserted that it is a 
peace-loving state. The whole world, led by the U.S. and the 
American sponsors of the peace process, also knows this fact. 
Syria's desire to establish peace does not mean it will accept 
unilateral deals or secret talks because of the time limit. 
Such deals have weakened the momentum of the peace process and 
lessened prospects of bringing about a just and comprehensive 
peace that can stand fast in the face of changes and meet the 
aspirations of the region's peoples and the world. 
  It is true that Syria wants peace, but it is also true that 
it is not in a hurry. The peace that Syria seeks is based on 
two principles: Justice and comprehensiveness in accordance 
with relevant UN resolutions--a peace that can restore the land 
and the rights regardless of time. What is important is the 
achievement of that peace. Syria is not responsible for 
hampering the peace march and wasting time. The whole world is 
well aware of who is responsible for that. A desire for peace 
can never mean embarking on the first train carrying that word. 
First, we have to make sure that the train is on the right 
railway. Otherwise, the peace train will not move, and even if 
it moves, it will not reach its target.

Washington; Reports of Civil Disobedience in Bani Walid"] 
  [Text] Cairo, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- The National Assembly 
of the (opposition) National Front for the Salvation of Libya 
will hold a meeting in Washington before the end of July. 
  Muhammad Fa'iz Jibril, the Front's representative in Cairo, 
has emphasized that the meeting will discuss several proposals 
to tackle conditions in Libya in the light of the reports 
submitted by the Front's representatives inside and outside 
Libya. 
  In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT Jibril pointed out that 
the Front will discuss the situation in the event that the 
international sanctions imposed on Libya are intensified as a 
result of the Libyan leadership's refusal to hand over the two 
Libyan Lockerbie suspects. 
  The Libyan oppositionist said that the internal situation 
will head the agenda of the Front's National Assembly. He 
pointed to the continuation of popular tension in the city of 
Bani Walid, stronghold of the "Warfallah" tribe, a pillar of 
President Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi's regime. 
  Jibril said that Bani Walid has long been experiencing a 
state of undeclared civil disobedience in the wake of the 
accusations al-Qadhdhafi leveled at a number of officers (55 
officers) belonging to the Warfallah tribe, namely that they 
worked to recruit elements to work for the United States. 
  He added that Bani Walid is currently under a tight security 
siege for fear of the state of civil disobedience spreading to 
other areas.

  [Text] Cairo, 21 Jun (MENA) -- The Sudanese Ummah Party has 
condemned the regime's arrest of its leader al-Sadiq al-Mahdi 
and two of its prominent members, 'Abd-al-Rahman Farah 
'Abd-al-Rahman and Professor Hammad Baqadi. 
  In a statement today, the Ummah Party described the arrest 
as 
a "drama" to divert people's attention from the numerous 
internal problems, particularly the aggravating living 
conditions. 
  The party said the arrest was part of the crackdown within 
the regime amid the extensive corruption ailing the state. 
  The party held the Sudanese authorities and the National 
Islamic Front responsible for the safety of the detainees and 
appealed to the international community and human rights 
organizations to put pressure on the regime to safeguard the 
detainees' lives.

  [Text] On the telephone to MBC today, the Sudanese Ummah 
Party, through former Interior Minister Mubarak Fadil al-Mahdi, 
denied the Sudanese government's accusations that al-Sadiq 
al-Mahdi, leader of the party and former prime minister, was 
involved in a conspiracy against President 'Umar Hasan 
al-Bashir. The Sudanese authorities arrested al-Mahdi and two 
of his aides on suspicion that they and foreign intelligence 
agencies planned to overthrow the government. 
  [Begin Fadil recording] We believe the arrests were made 
because the regime is besieged politically, economically, and 
diplomatically. As the regime approaches the celebration of 
five years in office in 10 days, it feels the earth being shaken 
beneath it. It therefore decided to launch this attack on the 
opposition leadership and on the biggest political bloc in a 
futile attempt to obstruct the movement for change in Sudan. 
The accusations and their scenario were prepared in a naive 
way. Al-Sadiq al-Mahdi will emerge innocent, and we consider 
this to be a malicious political and security act. This is a 
political battle that we will wage against the regime until the 
end. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Al-Mirghani: No Reconciliation With </F>
al-Bashir Regime"] 
  [Excerpts] London, Cairo, AL-HAYAH -- Sudanese Democratic 
Unionist Party [DUP] leader Muhammad 'Uthman al-Mirghani has 
emphasized that "there will be no negotiation and no 
reconciliation with the regime" of President 'Umar al-Bashir. 
The secretary general of the Arab Lawyers' Federation and 
chairman of the Coordination Committee of the Sudanese 
opposition's National Democratic Grouping [NDG] has stated that 
Sudanese opposition radio will begin transmission next week 
"from somewhere outside the Arab homeland." 
  A statement issued by al-Mirghani's office yesterday, of 
which AL-HAYAH has received a copy, said that reports of a 
reconciliation dialogue between al-Bashir and al-Mirghani were 
"not true" and that "the DUP's principled position regarding the 
regime of the (National Islamic) Front has been the same since 
the first day legitimacy was violated, namely that there will be 
no negotiation and no reconciliation with the regime, a position 
the party's leader, officials, and masses still adhere to." 
[passage omitted] 
  In Cairo, Abu-'Isa [secretary general of the Arab Lawyers' 
Federation] said at a news conference held at the headquarters 
of the Arab Lawyers' Federation and attended by Sudanese parties 
that the Sudanese opposition radio "will next week begin 
transmission of its programs beamed to the Sudanese people 
inside and outside Sudan to expose the practices of the ruling 
Sudanese regime and work for its downfall." 
  He said that the transmission would be from a country which 
he declined to name, but he stressed that "it is not Egypt or 
any other Arab country." 
  Abu-'Isa said that the NDG "is now the target of internal 
and 
external plots aimed at splitting its ranks." He reaffirmed the 
NDG's support for "the Sudanese opposition's unity and its 
common objective of bringing down the ruling regime, restoring 
democracy, and stopping the war in the south." 
  Abu-'Isa denied issuing a statement criticizing the 
political 
parties which form the NDG and calling for its replacement with 
a progressive rally. He reaffirmed interest in the continuation 
of the NDG and in working through it. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Anwer Khalil: "US Initiative for S Asia </F>
Regional Security"] 
  [Text] A new US diplomatic offensive seems to be in the 
offing to bring Pakistan under a regional security arrangement 
in South Asia supervised by India on behalf of the sole 
surviving superpower. Unconfirmed reports say that the latest 
non-papers or informal proposals received from the US underline 
the importance of a regional security system in South Asia. The 
presence here earlier this month of Mr Robert Oakley as also of 
some other experts who work for the State Department confirms 
that the "quiet diplomacy" to promote understanding between the 
United States and Pakistan is continuing. That in itself would 
be welcomed by many observes but there are others who think that 
any major initiatives need to be shared with the people and 
discussed publicity. 
  In the absence of any authoritative information on the 
subject, one has to rely on whatever unconfirmed reports are 
available. It is said that the US now wants Pakistan to adopt a 
regionalist approach and support a collective security system in 
South Asia. So far as Pakistan's disputes with India are 
concerned these should be tackled bilaterally with India. 
Translated in simple terms, it means that. 
  1 -- Pakistan shall not raise Kashmir in bilateral talks 
with 
the US. The issue shall be be raised with India bilaterally. 
  2 -- Pakistan's nuclear programme should be discussed 
without 
linking it to the Indian nuclear programme. 
  3 -- The US concerns about security and stability in South 
Asia can best be addressed through a collective security 
arrangement jointed by all states in South Asia. 
  The concept of regional security is not new. And it has been 
frequently raised. From mid-level US officials to President 
Clinton. 
  All have mentioned security in South Asia a workable 
concept. 
[sentence as published] Perhaps it also came under discussion in 
Pak-US talks previously but this time, the theme seems to be 
central. One reason might be Indian Prime Minister Narasimha 
Rao's Washington visit in May last. This is particularly 
relevant because the United States, over the last three years at 
least, has held a series of discussions with India on the 
subject. In 1992, the US held two rounds of bilateral talks 
with India on South Asian regional security and sought to obtain 
India's thoughts on how appropriately structured regional talks 
might deal with the underlying security concerns. 
  This was followed up with more talks on South Asian security 
-- in April this year. Mr Talbott, on his first visit abroad as 
US deputy secretary of state, arrived in New Delhi on what be 
described as "a mission of consultation between friends". 
During his talks in New Delhi, Mr Talbott "underscored the US 
commitment to promote greater peace and security in South Asia 
through both multilateral and bilateral initiatives". Two days 
later, addressing a press conference in Islamabad, he talked of 
a "multilateral forum" which he felt "would very much serve the 
interests of non-proliferation, of disarmament, of arms control 
and of security issues in general". 
  Apparently in the continuing discussions which followed Mr 
Talbott's visit in April this year, the important points 
elaborated include the high desirability of a multilateral forum 
to ensure security in South Asia. 
  In fact Mr Talbott had also hinted at the US exasperation 
at Pakistan's habit of linking Kashmir issue with all questions 
of security and non-proliferation. Mr Talbott advised us not to 
look backward saying that history is a complicating factor. He 
made it very clear that "the issue of non-proliferation is so 
important and so complex in itself, that it needs to be 
addressed very much in its own terms". Mr Talbott was also very 
categorical about delinking India from Pakistan-US bilateral 
relations. He minced no words when he said in Islamabad that 
Pakistan and India in "much of the last half century have been 
caught up in a zero-sum game, and that has influenced the United 
States in a way that we want very much to break out of." He 
plainly informed that "when American officials come here in 
future, they would not like to hear about Pakistan's problems 
with India." Talbott said this in April, 1994 and since then 
more than one team of Americans have come and gone. Mr Oakley 
was one such American and he seems to have used a more plain 
language than others. 
  Regional security and conflict resolution: The US 
policymakers perceive South-Asia as a potential flashpoint of a 
nuclear flare-up. Their logic is simple: The Kashmir problem, 
has already led the two major countries of the region, India and 
Pakistan, to fight three wars. The freedom movement in the 
Indian held Kashmir is creating its own heat and the cost of 
keeping the territory and the people of Kashmir under its hold 
is increasingly becoming unbearable for India. Pakistan is 
providing moral (and supposedly also material) support to the 
Kashmiri freedom-fighters. Since India is not likely to accede 
to the demands of the right of self-determination of the 
Kashmiris, there is bound to be a flare-up between the two 
rivals at some point. And since both are presumed to be nuclear 
threshold powers, the next round of war between India and 
Pakistan according to the Americans, has to be fought with 
nuclear weapons. 
  The truth is that the whole sequence cannot be dismissed as 
mere nonsense. The issue of Kashmir is very real and, despite 
the passage of more than four decades, has refused to be buried 
under the debris of broken promises both at the global level by 
the UN and regionally by the Indian leaders. There are, 
however, too many gaps and too many suppositions in the 
sequence. The thinking based on so faulty a reasoning can only 
lead to the kind of confusion manifest in the US initiatives 
taken one after the other. Each initiative was abandoned in 
quick succession and without making any real political effort to 
achieve the objectives. 
Alternate Options: Ever since it took the decision 
to stop all economic and military assistance to Pakistan, no US 
Administration had been able to come up with any meaningful 
basis for an enduring bilateral relationship between the two 
countries. If a bunch of US legislators in their anxiety to 
punish Pakistan exerted more pressure than what would have been 
civilised and if some of the more influential managers sitting 
next to the Foggy Bottom in Washington thought that the stoppage 
of all economic and military assistance will bring Pakistan to 
its knees and make it accept dictation, that can be condoned as 
one of the chronic bouts of arrogance that the mid-level 
representatives of a superpower are prone to suffer from. In 
any case, they stand disappointed. There were and there are 
many on the Capital Hill and at the State Department who did not 
agree with what was done to a close ally. What is unbelievable, 
however, is that no one had thought about policy options before 
demolishing the existing one. The result is that US policy for 
this region has continued to drift from one set of options to 
another without achieving anything tangible. First, it was the 
five-nation moot. Much time and effort was wasted in pursuit of 
this proposal. Then there was a new cry: "Preventive 
diplomacy". South Asia was declared to be the best place to 
demonstrate the efficacy of this new concept in managing affairs 
of the world. The tone and substance of this new slogan was 
undoubtedly in harmony with the new US role as the sole 
surviving superpower, particularly when the US took upon itself 
to rid the mankind of all evils, big and small. Well, the 
concept was too universal to fire the imagination of the people 
in a small region of the globe. 
  And now this new initiative of a regional security system 
for 
South Asia. There are two reasons why Pakistan shall reject 
this proposal outright. One: Because this will put an 
immediate freeze on the Kashmir issue which Pakistan simply 
cannot afford. And two because the proposal is calculated to 
completely exclude a role for China in South Asia. 
  This does not mean that the situation in South Asia is 
permanently disqualified from coming under a joint security 
system sustained and administered basically by the states in the 
region. Perhaps it would need a bold initiative in establishing 
a regional conflict resolution mechanism under the over-all 
supervision of the United Nations and supported by the five 
permanent members of the Security Council.

  [Text] Special Public Prosecutor Raja Abdul Aziz Bhatti 
yesterday filed two criminal cases of defamation against 
Mohammad Nawaz Sharif in the court of the district and sessions 
judge of Rawalpindi on behalf of the president and the prime 
minister. 
  During a news conference on 30 April in Karachi, Mohammad 
Nawaz Sharif had reportedly leveled serious charges of 
corruption against the president, prime minister and her 
husband, and the federal commerce minister in the cotton export 
deal. While challenging these charges, the special public 
prosecutor said that these charges were false, baseless, and 
devoid of truth. He said this has not only hurt the prestige of 
the president, the prime minister and her husband and the 
federal commerce minister, but the people were misled by its 
widespread publicity. 
  The court has summoned Mohammad Nawaz Sharif on 4 July.

  [Text] According to press reports, there was a meeting in 
the British capital three days ago between David Late [name as 
transliterated], an official in the U.S. Department of State, 
and officials from the London headquarters of Unified Iraqi 
National Congress [UINC] during which Late asked the UINC 
officials to close the London headquarters and move it to 
northern Iraq. 
  On this issue, Hani al-Fakiki, a prominent official in the 
UINC who did not attend the meeting because he was out of 
London, has made a statement to AL-SAFIR in which he expressed 
surprise at this U.S. demand, if the press reports are accurate. 
He said that the opening or closure of the UINC headquarters is 
an internal affair which only the organizations, parties, and 
political forces that are members of the UINC can decide upon. 
  Al-Fakiki said there is nothing new in the reported 
assertions by the U.S. official that the Baghdad regime should 
implement the UN resolutions, including Resolution 688, "because 
we and the Iraqi people have heard of this for two years ago and 
there is nothing new either in Late's statements or in his 
administration's stand." 
  Al-Fakiki added: "Events have confirmed that the U.S. 
administration and its Arab and non-Arab allies are only 
interested in the implementation of the UN resolutions that deal 
with the destruction of Iraq's military, economic, and political 
resources, but have no interest in human rights and freedoms nor 
any serious interest in implementing Resolution 688 or in 
putting an end to the Iraqi people's sufferings in the north, 
center, and south." He said: "Our people are tired and have 
run out of patience with the sweet words, promises, and slogans 
because they see what is in fact happening, their silence over 
the crimes, and the normalization of ties, all of which mean an 
Arab and regional siege of the Iraqi opposition." 
  The Iraqi opposition figure stressed that "the U.S. 
administration and its Arab and non-Arab allies have complete 
knowledge, documented by photographs and films, of the massacres 
committed by the regime against Iraq's Arabs in the south and 
the marshlands. A few weeks ago British MP Emma Nicholson 
screened in the parliament some documentaries filmed by the 
coalition forces' aircraft showing the burning of villages, the 
drainage of the marshlands in the areas of al-Bashrah and 
al-'Amarah, the diversion of river courses, the expulsion of 
Arab tribes from their camps, the effects of all this on the 
environment, the destruction of livestock, and the displacement 
of hundreds of thousands of southern Arab tribesmen, who have 
been pushed toward the Iranian-Iraqi borders." 
  He added: "The U.S. administration also has no lack of 
information about the regime's violations of human rights and 
its crushing of the Iraqi people's national determination to 
coexist in a unified state. By this, I mean the use of poison 
gas in the north and south. The regime is making daily 
announcements on its official radio and in the government press 
of executions, amputations of arms and legs, and unfair 
sentences in Mosul, Baghdad, and al-Basrah." 
  Al-Fakiki went on to say: "The Kurds' sufferings and the 
siege imposed on them, as well as the attacks on UN officials 
and members of the international relief organizations, are not 
unknown to the U.S. administration." 
  He warned the Iraqi opposition forces that "despite the 
importance of dealing with international and regional factors 
and exploiting them to serve the Iraqi people, this should not 
give us political illusions. The West's oil interests and its 
priorities of reaching a peaceful settlement, guaranteeing 
Israel's security, and drawing up a map of a new Middle East, 
plus the calculations of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, are not 
necessarily compatible with human rights and freedoms in Iraq or 
with the notion of bringing down tyranny and its backers." 
  Concluding his statement, al-Fakiki said: "Bringing down 
repression and establishing a democratic alternative is a 
national task; to achieve it we must be self-reliant. It is a 
major historic task of great difficulty that goes beyond the 
toppling of this or that regime, especially in an oil-producing 
country such as Iraq, given its position and neighbors."

  [Excerpt] Tehran, 18 Jun -- The human rights documentary 
center in Iraq today sent an urgent appeal to Max van der Stoel, 
special rapporteur of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Iraq, 
to halt a new collective exodus from various parts of Iraq. 
  In an urgent cable to Der Stoel, the Tehran based center 
said 
that the number of families who have arrived at the Hemet and Um 
Ni'aj border areas has reached 264 families, totalling 1,315 
persons according to the latest census. 
  The center indicates that the current exodus started three 
months ago, but has witnessed a large increase in the number of 
immigrants during the last month. 
  The cable says that the reasons of the exodus are caused by 
the stepping up of oppressive measures by the Iraqi regime, such 
as arrests, executions, and because of the deteriorating life 
and health conditions of the immigrants, such as the outbreak of 
skin diseases and dysentery. 
  The cable says that the new wave of immigrants are from 
Baghdad, al-Hillah, Karbala', al-Basrah, al-Qurnah, al-Madinah, 
Misan, al- Mijar, al-Nasiriyah, al-Chebaich, and the marshes of 
Suk al-Shuyukh, al-Hammar, and al-Fuhud. 
  In another development, a communique issued here today by 
the 
supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq [SAIRI] says 
that the engineers corps of the Iraqi regime's Army have 
completed the preliminary works in a new destructive project, 
which could be considered as the final phase in the so-called 
al-Anfal Project III, which was carried out early last year and 
which caused the draining of vast areas of southern Iraq's 
marshes. 
  The communique quotes sources in southern Iraq as saying 
that 
the new project consists of a canal starting at al-Maymunah 
district, southwest of al-'Amarah, toward the al-Islah region in 
the al- Nasiriyah governorate in southern Iraq, then west 
alongside the al-Nasiriyah marshes to meet the Euphrates, and 
then into the Shatt al-Arab. 
  The engineers corps of the Iraqi regime's Army are carrying 
out the new project, which is costing about 65 million Iraqi 
dinars, in cooperation with the Irrigation Ministry. [passage

  [Text] Baghdad, June 22, INA--Iraq's permanent ambassador 
to the United Nations, Nizar Hamdun said the Iraqi diplomacy 
engineered by President Saddam Husayn had a prominent role in 
breaking basic chapters of the siege imposed on the country. 
  In an interview to AL-JUMHURIYAH newspaper, published here 
today, Mr Hamdun added that the current position of the 
leadership and the recent visit by deputy premier, Tariq 'Aziz, 
to New York and his talks with the Security Council members was 
a solid one and placed Iraq's enemies and advocates of the 
continuity of the blockade in a difficult and critical corner, 
because it stripped them of the pretexts. 
  The Iraqi diplomat regarded the increase in number of the 
states supporting Iraq's cooperation with the Security Council 
and the progress made in implementing the resolutions and the 
lifting of the blockade as the best evidence on feasibility of 
the Iraqi stance and effectiveness of the Iraqi diplomacy. 
  Assessing the position inside the Security Council during 
the 
July discussions, Mr Hamdun further said "the continuity of the 
Iraqi cooperation with the U.N and its specialized bodies drew 
further hostile pretexts, thus the forthcoming discussions by 
the Security Council should largely reflect the positive state". 
  He stressed that the July discussions would be a step 
forward 
for lifting the blockade. 
  The U.S policy versus Iraq is governed by the complex of its 
traditional view to the Middle East and in the light of factors 
of the Arab-Israeli conflict in addition to the substantial 
issue, namely, the energy and its flow, Mr Hamdun said. 
  He confirmed that Iraq was an important country and its role 
within the frame of the future view could not be set aside by 
the decision-makers in the United States, and any arrangements 
to be discussed or implemented would remain inferior unless Iraq 
is playing its normal geo-political role in the region.

  [Text] Baghdad, 21 Jun (INA)--Oil Minister Safa' Hadi Jawad 
has returned to Baghdad after taking part in the OPEC 
Ministerial Council's conference held recently in the Austrian 
capital. 
  In a statement to the IRAQI NEWS AGENCY, the minister said 
that participants in the conference have decided to retain until 
the end of this year the OPEC's current output ceiling of 24.5 
million barrels per day. 
  He added that Iraq's participation in the conference has 
proved its positive role in serving the organization's goals of 
protecting the interests of the OPEC member states. 
  The minister also said he had held meetings with oil 
ministers on the sidelines of the conference to explain the 
impact of the economic blockade imposed on Iraq--a blockade 
which has prevented Iraq from investing its oil wealth. He 
added that during these meetings, he asserted that Iraq would 
return to the oil market as soon as the blockade is lifted, 
would remain a positive factor, and would exert every effort to 
maintain OPEC's interests.

  [Text] Baghdad, 19 Jun (INA)--Yusuf Khudayyir al-Juburi, 
director general of the State Enterprise for Civil Aviation, has 
asserted that all Iraqi civilian airports will be ready to 
receive planes of all types and sizes once the unfair air 
embargo clamped on Iraq is lifted. 
  In a statement to INA, the director general of the State 
Enterprise said that Iraqi engineers and technicians have 
managed to rebuild all the installations and systems related to 
the reception of planes. The control equipment used to direct 
planes once they enter Iraqi airspace and until they land at 
Saddam International Airport, al-Basrah International Airport, 
Mosul Airport, or al-Muthanna Airport has also been rebuilt. 
  Al-Juburi went on to say that the reconstruction of Iraqi 
civilian airports has been completed with national expertise. 
Right now, Iraqi civilian airports match other airports in the 
world in terms of specifications and services.

  [Text] Baghdad, 18 Jun (INA)--A number of Iraqi businessmen 
and industrialists have voluntarily contributed $2.275 million, 
equivalent to 1 billion Iraqi dinars, to finance some food 
imports, on condition that they are repaid in dollars after the 
unfair economic embargo is lifted. 
  This has been announced to INA by Trade Minister Dr. 
Muhammad 
Mahdi Salih, who said these businessmen and industrialists are 
the first group of contributors, who will be followed by other 
groups. 
  He explained that this step expresses the readiness of Iraqi 
businessmen and industrialists to contribute to confronting the 
economic blockade, along with other segments of the society. It 
also comes in light of President Saddam Husayn's instructions 
that merchants be given a chance to voluntarily contribute to 
the importation of food.

  [Text] Baghdad, June 22, INA -- Member of the visiting 
French businessmen delegation, Mr. Folon Stephan, affirmed the 
delegation's substantial mission was to furnish the French 
National Assembly with a clear picture of the Iraqi people's 
sufferings caused by the unjust blockade and thus to urge it 
reconsidering its erroneous policies towards Iraq . 
  The French businessman told AL-THAWRAH daily for today that 
the 28-firm delegation, of different specializations, was 
seeking to conclude and to renew their agreements with the Iraqi 
counter sides as well as to approach viewpoints between the 
Iraqi and French officials with the intent of restoring normal 
relations between the two countries. 
  The UN-imposed blockade on Iraq would soon be lifted and 
Iraq 
would regain its weight among world nations, Mr Folon 
anticipated . He concluded that world's major companies were 
looking forward to have contracts with Iraq anew, especially the 
French ones, which has found Iraq the friend who always meets 
its commitments.

<F P=106> [Statement by Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri to the Chamber </F>
of Deputies in Beirut on 21 June--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] Mr. Speaker, deputies: Since this government 
took office, it has been striving together with the honorable 
chamber to elevate our country and liberate it from several 
restrictions which have manacled it throughout the past years 
and made it a captive of several whims, mentalities, struggles, 
plots, and secret and non- secret designs. Certainly we have 
made great strides in this direction and have realized 
achievements that enable us to renew confidence in our future 
and to confront the challenges with the hoped-for level of 
national solidarity. [passage omitted] 
  Mr. Speaker, deputies: The delicate phase through which 
Lebanon is passing requires the highest degrees of vigilance and 
solidarity. We are facing fateful challenges that are first and 
foremost connected to liberating our land from the Israeli 
occupation and standing on a equal footing with the states 
joining us in the race toward the future in the Middle East. 
Therefore, I find myself obliged before your honorable chamber 
to underline the following points: 
  1. The liberation of our land from Israeli occupation is not 
subject to any kind of diplomatic debate. Therefore, it is not 
subject to bargaining with any regional or international body. 
Lebanon views the negotiations held in this connection as a 
means to achieve its liberation and not as an objective in 
itself to be used to cow Lebanon to go along with the Israeli 
objectives of controlling our land, water, and resources. In 
the past few weeks Lebanon has received several messages through 
security, diplomatic, and media avenues. It has been and is 
still being subjected to repeated Israeli attacks aimed at 
undermine its national strength and jeopardizing its relations 
with its big sister Syria. However, Lebanon can only take 
stances chosen by the people, stances compatible with its 
sovereignty, dignity, and its rights to land and resources. 
  I must stress here--in the Lebanese Chamber of 
Deputies--that 
Lebanon will not submit to Israeli pressures, regardless of 
their intensity. It reserves the right to use all means to 
liberate its land and impose its legitimate authority over all 
its territory. The Lebanese Government has shouldered its 
national responsibility in protecting Lebanon's principles on 
the issue of liberation. It reemphasizes today its rejection of 
any approach intended to make the Lebanese state a policeman for 
Israeli occupation, nor will we allow Israel to shrug off its 
responsibility for the occupation by clashing with the 
resistance, which is the natural outcome of the continuation of 
the occupation. All Lebanese have behaved with complete 
vigilance and responsibility regarding their right to resist the 
Israeli occupation, because this resistance is an inseparable 
part of the Lebanese national interest and results from the 
Lebanese consensus to end the occupation and safeguard our 
sovereignty. In any circumstance, the government can only be in 
a position to defend this interest and affirm this consensus. 
  The Lebanese state is not a tool in Israel's hands. 
Accordingly, it rejects any offers that aim to use it as a 
weapon used against its people. Resistance is not a target to 
be aimed at, but a right embodying the genuineness of the 
Lebanese people and their love of their land. We uphold our 
right to liberate our land. We uphold our right to resist the 
occupation. We uphold our right to restore our sovereignty and 
freedom on all our national soil. We will not be deflected from 
this course by pressures, messages, or warnings. Nor will we be 
deflected by the straying of some Arabs from the circle of Arab 
solidarity, or by others resorting to separate solutions. 
  The Lebanese Government will not depart from the line it has 
chosen toward the Arab brothers, even if some of them depart 
from it. Together with sister Syria, it will continue to 
negotiate when negotiations are a way to end the occupation, and 
to boycott when boycotts are in the national interest and are 
our duty. It is futile to call for us to return to peace under 
the threat of the sword's edge; it will crush peace, not achieve 
it. Therefore, we warn against the possibility of the failure 
of peace under the blows of Israel and its maneuvers. We 
address our warning to all those concerned with the issue of 
peace and who believe in the need for a just and comprehensive 
solution to the region's crisis. 
  2. The external dangers resulting from the continuation of 
Israeli occupation and attacks places on all of us--government, 
chamber, and people--the responsibility to stand in solidarity 
in the face of these dangers and not give those who would 
trample our security and sovereignty a chance to achieve their 
aims of dividing the domestic front. 
  Lebanon is facing the new regional storm by cooperating and 
coordinating with sister Syria and with its leadership, which 
has shown extraordinary courage in confronting crucial issues; 
it has displayed a responsible attitude toward Arab issues in 
general and toward Lebanon and its struggle for national peace 
in particular. Syria's support for us and its pan-Arab 
commitments to Lebanon and its people do not absolve us from our 
responsibility to our homeland and must not become a reason for 
weakening this responsibility. 
  Therefore, the Government wishes to reaffirm some principles 
that were mentioned in its last statement to this honorable 
chamber. These principles deal with the need to elevate 
political life to the level of civil peace and national detente. 
This is a very difficult task in a country which has suffered 
so long from chaos and sectarian and religious strife. Lebanon 
is trying to perform political miracles and to introduce the 
necessary legislation to emerge from the vestiges of that stage. 
[passage omitted] 
  3. The issue of media freedom is not the subject of a 
political argument, nor it is the subject of deep differences 
among the Lebanese or between the Government and any political 
party in Lebanon. The Government does not dispute the principle 
of this freedom at all. It does not allow itself to contest the 
issue of freedoms and their limits. However, it is natural for 
the Government to work to protect media freedom with a legal 
cover that will safeguard it and define the rules of the game. 
Before this Government, several governments tried to create an 
objective and responsible framework for the broadcast media. It 
was natural for all the debates and dialogues which accompanied 
these attempts to disagree on some points and agree on other 
points. It was not possible for the experiment to ripen 
quickly. Months passed before our Government settled this issue 
once and for all yesterday when it approved a broadcast media 
law which we hope your honorable chamber will discuss in a 
democratic and positive way. 
  The broadcast media bill approved yesterday is the first of 
its kind in Lebanon's legislative history and perhaps the first 
of its kind in the Arab world. As much as we wanted it to 
express the genuine relationship between freedom and Lebanon, we 
also wanted it to truly express the strong relationship between 
freedom and the law. [passage omitted] 
  4. The process of national reconstruction, which has 
proceeded along two parallel lines--completing the return of the 
refugees and restoring public services--will continue to be 
sponsored by the Government until it achieves its desired 
objectives as set down in the declared plans. We have given the 
issue of returning the refugees priority for our Government. 
The Ministry of Refugee Affairs has been able to take 
impressive steps both on returning lands and properties and 
paying compensations and in the area of promoting reconciliation 
among the inhabitants and enabling thousands of Lebanese 
citizens to return to their places of birth and residence. 
[passage omitted] 
  In the name of the Government, allow me to commend here in 
the honorable Chamber of Deputies the extraordinary effort made 
by His Excellency the Minister of Refugee Affairs Walid Junblatt 
and to put on record his responsible personal and public stand 
in protecting progress of the return and pushing it several 
steps forward, especially in the mountain area, which these days 
is witnessing blessed measures taken by the Lebanese army in 
Upper al-Matn, 'Alayh, and Al-Shuf. We hope that these measures 
will bear fruit in the coming months and will consolidate the 
march of national cohesion among all Lebanese in general and 
among the inhabitants of the mountains in particular. 
  Parallel to this, the government has mobilized its moral and 
material resources in the south and in the western al-Biqa'. It 
has earmarked the necessary funds to face the consequences of 
the Israeli attacks and to pay compensations to property owners 
and farmers who are targets of daily shelling. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Statement by Information Minister Michel Samahah, followed </F>
by remarks in response to questions by unidentified 
correspondents; after an extraordinary meeting of the Council of 
Ministers in Beirut on 20 June--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Samahah] The Council of Ministers held an 
extraordinary session this evening that was attended by his 
excellency the president of the Republic. 
  During the session, the Council of Ministers approved the 
law 
on audiovisual media and referred it to the Chamber of Deputies 
for ratification. [passage omitted] 
  As approved by the Council of Ministers this evening, the 
audiovisual media law is basically characterized by the tendency 
to diversify the types of media establishments and guarantee 
their respect for the spirit and text of the Constitution, the 
national accord document, and the principle of enhancing 
Lebanese impunity based on integration and [word indistinct]. 
Moreover, it takes into consideration the adoption of a modern 
approach, both legally and practically, to the components of 
audiovisual media with a view to giving media establishments a 
legal status as being more serious establishments that basically 
depend on the national Lebanese production in their programs and 
freely select programs that respect our family, social, and 
national values to enrich the minds of our viewers and listeners 
and keep them informed about local and foreign news. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Correspondent] What about political programs and newscasts? 
  [Samahah] Political newscasts will be unrestricted for the 
establishments that apply for a license as public institutions 
broadcasting political news and programs within the context of 
established laws. 
  [Correspondent] Were amendments introduced on the law? 
  [Samahah] This 13-chapter and 47-article law underwent an 
in-depth discussion by the Council of Ministers and by the ad 
hoc committee before and after the cabinet session. Many 
amendments were introduced to enrich the law out of the 
cabinet's carefulness to safeguard the citizen's constitutional 
freedom. 
  [Correspondent] [question indistinct] 
  [Samahah] In the bill approved this evening, the government 
does not accept the state's control of shares in any mass media, 
apart from what the state already owns in Tele-Liban. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Will you permit mass media to broadcast the 
proceedings of the Chamber of Deputies session tomorrow at the 
suggestion of Speaker Nabih Birri? 
  [Samahah] We discussed the speaker's suggestion to let 
private mass media broadcast the proceedings of the Chamber of 
Deputies session tomorrow. The Council of Ministers decided to 
make this exclusive to Tele-Liban. 
  [Correspondent] [question indistinct] 
  [Samahah] The law did not address encouraging or 
discouraging 
the parties to do that. Just like other public institutions and 
citizens, parties have the right to have their own beliefs and 
to express these beliefs [words indistinct] 
  [Correspondent] Is it possible to allow private radios to 
broadcast newscasts at present, before the bill is enforced? 
  [Samahah] Up to now, nothing can be added to the cabinet 
decision on 23 March to suspend newscasts, until the bill is 
enforced. I cannot add anything to that decision. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Correspondent] [question indistinct] 
  [Samahah] Practical measures to retype the law will be taken 
tomorrow or after tomorrow [words indistinct]. 
  [Correspondent] [question indistinct] 
  [Samahah] According to the new law, the employment agency 
can 
own 35 percent of the shares of the radio or television company. 
Regular persons cannot own more than 10 percent of shares.

  [Text] Sidon, Lebanon, June 21 (AFP) -- A Palestinian was 
cleared here of murdering a Libyan dissident in Germany but is 
still being detained for questioning about an anti-US bombing in 
Berlin eight years ago, his lawyer said. 
  The Lebanese criminal court pronounced Yasir Shuraydah, 34, 
not guilty in the 1984 murder of Mustafa al-'Ashiq in Germany. 
Another Palestinian, Ghassan Ayyub, was also cleared in the 
case. 
  Germany has demanded Shuraydah's extradition from Lebanon as 
part of investigations into the April 5, 1986 bombing of the La 
Belle discotheque in west Berlin frequented by US troops. There 
is no extradition treaty between Beirut and Bonn. 
  Under Lebanese law a foreigner living in Lebanon can be 
tried 
for a crime committed in this country or abroad and any 
extradition measure can only be decided by the cabinet after a 
verdict is pronounced. 
  The Lebanese authorities have not charged Shuraydah in 
connection with the La Belle attack and he has denied any 
involvement in the bombing that killed three people and wounded 
230 others. 
  Washington blamed the attack on Libya. Ten days later US 
bombers blasted the headquarters of Libyan leader Mu'ammar 
al-Qadhdhafi in Tripoli. 
  Shuraydah's lawyer, Muna al-Samrah, said that he was still 
being held at the Rumiyah prison, east of Beirut, where Ayyub is 
also detained. She said the pair were cleared of al-'Ashiq's 
murder "because there is no proof that they were guilty." 
  Shuraydah, who along with Ayyub comes from the 'Ayn 
al-Hulwah 
Palestinian refugee camp on the eastern outskirts of the port 
city of Sidon, was arrested here in 1991 in connection with a 
string of murders, attempted murder and burglaries.

  [Excerpt] Tehran, 21 Jun (KUNA) -- Ayatollah Muhammad Baqir 
al-Hakim, chairman of the Supreme Assembly of the Islamic 
Revolution in Iraq [SAIRI] expressed his conviction in Tehran 
today that the Iraqi regime was involved in the Mashhad 
explosion which led to the killing and injuring of many Iranian 
and foreign visitors. 
  In a message of condolence to the leader of the Islamic 
Revolution, al-Hakim said: I believe that the fascist regime has 
had a hand in the barbaric and cruel attack on the visitors to 
the shrine. 
  He added: This great crime reminds us of the barbaric acts 
perpetrated by Saddam's regime and his criminal and two-faced 
allies; be it the killing of the participants in the Friday 
prayers in Tehran or attacking the holy shrines in Karbala and 
Najaf in Iraq and the killing of thousands of people mercilessly.

  [Text] Tehran, June 22, IRNA -- A morning English daily 
here Wednesday [22 June] criticized the support of some of the 
Western governments for the terrorist Mojahedin-e Khalq 
Organization (MKO) and argued that the said countries were as 
much responsible for the last Monday's tragedy in Mashhad as the 
MKO themselves. 
  The `TEHRAN TIMES' in its editorial referred to the tragedy 
of bombing in Imam Reza (as) [expansion unknown] mausoleum in 
Khorasan Province, committed by the MKO, and noted that the 
terrorist group has always been enjoying the support of the 
Western governments. 
  The ironic aspect of the case, it added, was that Iran has 
constantly been accused by the Western countries and their 
regional allies of supporting the terrorist groups. 
  The Islamic Republic has often been the target of terrorist 
acts by MKO and has offered many martyrs from among the 
government authorities and the commom people in connection with 
blind acts of terrorism committed by the MKO who now have been 
forced to deny their involvement due to the horrible extent of 
the recent crime, added the paper. 
  Thus the present occasion would seem to be a proper moment 
to 
ask the Western countries and their allies "whether their blind 
support for this terrorist group accords with the principle of 
justice." 
  The Western governments have not only condoned the terrorist 
acts of MKO, but they have persisted in calling the Islamic 
Republic the supporter of terrorist groups, said the paper. 
  It noted in conclusion that as the crime was the most 
obvious 
form of violation of the human rights by MKO, the Westerners, as 
the self-styled advocates of the human rights, should revise 
their past hypocritical approach (towards Iran) and deliver the 
culprits to the Iranian nation.

  [Excerpts] An unprecedented funeral ceremony was held in 
the holy city of Mashhad today for the martyrs of the Hoseyn's 
Ashura day incident inside the holy shrine of Imam Reza, amid 
the participation of the masses. [crowd chants "Death to the 
monafeqin," "Death to America," and "These are the evidences of 
the U.S. crime"] 
  The coffins were carried shoulder high by the people of 
Mashhad. The streets leading to the holy shrine were packed with 
masses of mourners, who, shedding tears, were offering 
condolences to Imam Reza for the desecration of his holy 
sanctuary. The city of Mashhad observed a holiday in solidarity 
to enable the people to attend the funeral ceremony for the 24 
martyrs of the heinous crime of the monafeqin [Mojahedin-e 
Khalq]. 
  From the early hours of the morning masses of mourners moved 
to the streets leading to the holy shrine. [passage omitted] 
At about 1000, all the routes leading to the holy shrine were 
blocked due to the presence of so many mourners. [passage

<F P=106> [Interview with President Hashemi-Rafsanjani by former </F>
French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas and other members of 
selected panel in Crans Montana on 16 June -- live; in French, 
with passage by passage translation into Persian by unidentified 
moderator; italics indicate portions audible in French that 
differ from Persian translation] 
  [Excerpt] [Dumas] Mr. President, I am listening to 
our conversation in Spanish, this is one of the wonders of the 
airwaves, but it does not matter. We have a certain number of 
questions interesting those taking part in the forum and I would 
like to ask them. 
  The first question concerns regional tensions centered 
around 
Iran. What will be the policy of the Islamic Republic toward 
the territories occupied by Kurdish people in Iraq and Turkey? 
Second, what do you think about the development of ethnic 
conflicts in the republics of the former Soviet Union, and what 
is the Islamic Republic's attitude concerning these conflicts? 
This is the first question summing up the various interventions 
from the participants to the forum. 
  [Unidentified moderator] Your Excellency, Mr. President. My 
first question is regarding relations between Iran and its 
neighbors, in particular the territories in Iraq and Turkey 
inhabited by Kurds. The second question is on the policy of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran toward differences in the states of the 
former Soviet Union? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] On Iran's neighbors. Our principled 
policy is to have peaceful and friendly cooperation with them. 
And should issues occur, the principle is to solve them through 
negotiation and debate. Regarding Iraq and Kordestan, naturally 
our declared policy is to respect Iraq's territorial integrity. 
Territorial integrity must be maintained. The Kurds in Turkey 
and Iraq will be members of these countries. However, it is of 
course possible in these countries to give them rights, as a 
nationality, with their own consent. 
  Regarding the states which have separated from the former 
Soviet Union. Unfortunately, difference have occurred in some 
places. Our policy is to help them solve the differences. Our 
advice to others, even Russia, is not to interfere in these 
countries. In a country where people have been liberated after 
70 years, it is natural to have various forms of demands and for 
differences to occur. Others should help solve the problems 
properly, not interfere, and not weaken the independence of the 
country. 
  [Dumas] Thank you, Mr. President. If I may, I will ask 
two other questions -- one about an issue of great concerns to 
Europeans, namely Bosnia. As we all know, there are armed 
Muslims opposing Serbs in several regiosn of Bosnia, there is a 
war. How do you see Iran's role? What role can Iran play in 
this situation? Is it a purely diplomatic role? Could it be a 
support for these combatants taking the form of arms supplies? 
Or coudl we envisage a direct intervention? What is your 
country's position on this worrying Bosnian conflict? 
  [Moderator] Your Excellency Mr. President. Thank you for the 
answers, and now I must ask another question. My first question 
is about Bosnia. As you know, a group of Muslims live in this 
country and are in conflict with the Serbs. What is the policy 
of the Islamic Republic of Iran regarding these Muslims? Does 
Iran have a purely political role or a role in providing arms to 
the Muslims? Are the other means of aid provided by the Islamic 
Republic a form of direct interference, or do they come under 
the category of ordinary aid? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] Regarding Bosnia. Unfortunately, there 
has been a tragic situation there. The hands of the majority of 
the people of this country have been tied, but a minority, the 
Serbs, have been allowed to commit aggression. That is, they 
can have a direct link with the former Yugoslavia, which 
supports them. Our policy is to end the war, with the help of 
the United Nations and you, the powerful European countries and 
neighbors, and through peaceful ways and negotiations. If the 
war is to continue, despite the intentions and wishes of all 
sincere individuals, the present situation will have to change. 
If you, the United Nations and others, feel unable to end the 
war, you should allow the innocent party to have defensive 
capabilities. 
  Of course, we have until now acted according to the UN 
policy. Our aid has been very clear. It was financial, fuel, 
and humanitarian. We proposed to send a peacekeeping force, 
because it has been said that the peacekeeping force there is 
weak. In the future we shall try to progress with the UN 
policy. But we firmly ask everyone to have a just policy. Do 
not allow the violation of a peoples' right. This would create 
a center of aggravation and disease in the Balkan region, and 
this would be difficult to cure in the future. 
  [Moderator] Thank you, Mr. President for your reply. One of 
the gentlemen at the session wishes to ask you a question. 
  [J.P. Carteron, not further identified, in French] Mr. 
President, I would like to ask you a very important question for 
us here. Iran's relations with France and Switzerland are not 
good. Serious court cases provoking a violent dispute are 
currently under way. Your deputy foreign Minister, Mahmoud 
Va'ezi, was recently received by French President Francois 
Mitterrand. This is obviously a gesture by both sides. Does 
this represent a coming together? At last, Mr. President, I 
would like you to tell us, how do you see the means to improve 
your relations with France and Switzerland on a very specific 
plan? 
  [Moderator] Mr. President, my question is considered very 
important here. My question concerns France's and Switzerland's 
relations with Iran, which are not at all good. Recently Iran's 
Deputy Foreign Minister Va'ezi was in France, where he met 
Francois Mitterrand, and apparently some measures were taken. In 
your excellency's opinion, what are the significant factors 
contributing to the improvement of Iran's relations with France 
and Switzerland, and what suggestions can you make in that 
respect? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] Very well. It is possible to speak in 
length about that, but our time is short here. I think if our 
friends in France try not to be influenced by the false 
propaganda which is waged against Iranian policies, then we can 
quite easily expand our cooperation. The political intent 
toward further cooperation exists in Iran. [passage omitted] 
  [Dumas] Thank you, Mr. President. Could I ask you now a 
question about a worrying issue -- Algeria? As you know, the 
Islamic Salvation Front, the FIS, is openly fighting the 
authorities in Algeria. What attitude does Iran want and what 
attitude can it adopt concerning this situation? I sum up: Can 
Iran be a mere observer, a mediator, or is it actively 
supporting the FIS? 
  [Moderator] Thank you, Your Excellency Mr. President. My 
other question is regarding Algeria. As you know, 
fundamentalist Muslims, the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front], are 
virtually at war with the Algerian Government. I would like to 
know, what is the policy of the Islamic Republic here? Has 
there only been advice or has there been help by the Islamic 
Republic for these groups? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] The Algerian issue must be important 
for 
you, as well. An unfortunate event occurred in Algeria and the 
vote of a nation's majority was not respected. I think it must 
be one of the most bitter problems for the champions of 
democracy. We think the solution in Algeria lies in respect for 
people's vote. I think we have been blamed because we spoke our 
views frankly and without hesitation. There has been no other 
interference on our behalf in the Algerian issue. 
  Our advice to you, as well as the people and Government of 
Algeria, is that we should come out of this. There is no other 
way except respect for people's vote. We are not at all happy 
with the destruction and the killings in this Muslim country. 
We are surprised that you, the champions of democracy, fail to 
see this very clear situation. I wish you would also answer 
this question of mine. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati by </F>
unidentified correspondent; place and date not given: "'Arafat 
Will Become Mayor"] 
  [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat now wants 
to visit the autonomous regions of Gaza and Jericho. However, 
instead of promoting the process of reconciliation in the Middle 
East, Iran supports the Islamic resistance fighters of the 
Hizballah in southern Lebanon who are firing Katyusha missiles 
against Israel. 
  [Velayati] The behavior of the Hizballah and of the 
"Palestinian group" are two completely different things. The 
Hizballah is a Lebanese organization. It defends its country, 
whose southern part is occupied. Resistance against this 
occupation is legitimate. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Yet it also support the Palestinian 
underground organization Hamas; Israel's and the PLO's most 
dangerous opponent. 
  [Velayati] We have practically not taken any measures 
against the PLO. We only said from the very beginning that this 
agreement will not solve Palestine's problems. What was the 
result of the agreement? 'Arafat will become mayor of Gaza, but 
that is it. What process should we promote? 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Would it not be about time for Iran to 
recognize Israel? 
  [Velayati] Israel is an usurpatory regime that we do not 
recognize. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Is Iran not pretending to be more Palestinian 
than the Palestinians themselves? 
  [Velayati] First 'Arafat should prove that he is the 
representative of all Palestinians -- which he is not. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Even Syria holds negotiations with the Israeli 
archenemy on a "real and comprehensive peace." 
  [Velayati] That's Syria's business. However, as far as we 
know, the peace talks are stalled. Syria refuses to continue 
negotiations with Israel. To exert pressure on Damascus, Israel 
attacked Lebanon again recently. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] However, if Syria and Lebanon, which depends 
on Syria, make peace with Israel, the days of the Hizballah are 
numbered -- or the fighters for God would have to rise against 
the Lebanese and the Syrian Armies. 
  [Velayati] Hizballah's prospects for a political future are 
good. As a party, it even bears responsibility in the Lebanese 
Government and enjoys a great deal of support. For this reason, 
the Hizballah will not fight against the Lebanese Government. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] In Yemen, too, where the fundamentalist north 
and the socialist south are engaged in a fierce battle, Iran is 
allegedly fomenting unrest. It is reportedly supplying North 
Yemen's President Salih 'Ali 'Abdallah with weapons. 
  [Velayati] We do not support either side. Our principle is: 
First, the unity of the country should be preserved, and, 
second, the conflict should be settled peacefully. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Yet South Yemen has reported Iranian fighter 
aircraft in the north. 
  [Velayati] This is simply not true. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] However, the Islamic-conservative north is 
closer to Iran. 
  [Velayati] No, we are interested in all Yemenis, who are one 
people and one nation -- like the Germans. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The West -- and the Arab states -- are 
concerned about continued Iranian efforts to export its Islamic 
revolutionary model, thus causing additional unrest in the 
Middle East region. 
  [Velayati] These accusations are not justified. We do not 
export our revolution with the use of force. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Islamic fundamentalists in Sudan or in Algeria 
are boasting that they have been trained and supplied with 
weapons by Tehran for their armed fight against lay and 
pro-Western regimes. 
  [Velayati] I reject this allegation vehemently. Instead of 
exporting violence, we are trying to cooperate with our 
neighbors and promote economic cooperation in the region. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You have even established contact with your 
long-time war enemy, Iraq. You will shortly travel to Baghdad 
for talks. 
  [Velayati] We want to have good relations with all our 
neighbors, including Iraq. If Saddam Husayn is president -- 
this is none of our business. We will not interfere. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Four officials of the Kurdish party banned in 
Iran were killed in Berlin in October 1992 by a killer commando. 
The secret service of your government is believed to be behind 
the attack. 
  [Velayati] This is not true. We vehemently reject this 
accusation. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] In the so-called Mykonos trial, the federal 
public prosecutor described Tehran as the mastermind of the 
operation and accused your government of state terrorism. 
  [Velayati] This is his business. It is our task to support 
Iranian citizens who are facing trial abroad. After all, Iran 
is their home country. However, there is no link between these 
people and our government. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Above all, extremists like Ayatollah 
Mohtashemi are believed to promote the export of terrorism. Has 
the more Western-oriented head of state 'Ali Akbar Hashemi 
Rafsanjani lost the fight against the radicals in his own ranks? 
  [Velayati] Everybody can have his own political ideas and he 
is allowed to express them. However, our government makes the 
decisions in foreign policy. President Hashemi-Rafsanjani is a 
very powerful head of state.

conducted with Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati, the 
Iranian interests section office in Cairo has clarified that 
Iran denies all the reports that it is sending weapons to Bosnia 
in violation of the international resolutions. 
  The office reiterated Iran's declaration of support for the

embargo on weapons to Bosnia to defend its rights is unfair and 
that Iran is seriously demanding the lifting of this embargo.

<F P=106> [Second Friday prayers sermon by Ayatollah 'Ali Akbar </F>
Meshkini-Qomi in Qom on 17 June -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God, the compassionate, the 
merciful. [passage omitted] Apparently, during the same 
gathering in Crans Montana an interview was arranged where the 
Iranian president carried out an interview with them by 
satellite -- for questions to be put to the president and the 
respected president to respond to them. He replied and made 
Iranians proud. I listened to the contents of the president's 
replies. They were all excellent. The nation endorses such 
issues [crowd chants: "God is great," "Khamene'i is the leader," 
"Death to the anti-independence and revolution"], especially as 
his remarks were in accordance with the high objectives of the 
nation and in line with the wishes of our great leader 
[Khamene'i]. I hope that God makes his words effective. 
  Another point I should mention here is that the eminent 
leader's directions should be implemented by the people. When 
we speak of the eminent leader... [pauses] The same reasons that 
since the era of the Shaykh Mofid [Islamic scholar] until now 
have given the great personalities and sources of emulation 
legitimacy, religious authority, religious leadership, influence 
of word, authority to be obeyed, they have made our great 
leader, Ayatollah Khamene'i as well. [crowd chants: "Peace be 
upon Prophet Muhammad and his scion"] We recognize the authority 
of our leader as a leader for the same reasons that we 
recognized the grand Ayatollahs Esfahani, Borujerdi, Hakim, 
Ruhollah [Khomeyni], Golpayegani, and 'Araki, may God extend 
their shadow. 
  Please pay attention: His order is influential. If even a 
religious leader issues a fatwa [religious edict] and Khamene'i 
issues a ruling, that ruling takes precedence over the fatwa. 
If a religious leader has written a book of religious practices 
-- and he has the right to do so, he is an honorable source of 
emulation -- he has written in his book of religious practices. 
I think it is religiously forbidden to enter arms deals with a 
certain country. That becomes a fatwa. Then the leader sits 
down and finds that to deal in arms with such and such a country 
is appropriate today. He issues a ruling that the government 
should sell arms. The government is obliged to carry out the 
ruling and set aside the fatwa, that is because the religious 
leaders here say: A ruling cancels a fatwa, but a fatwa does 
not cancel a ruling. [previous clause in Arabic] [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Tehran, June 18 (AFP) -- Foreign television programs 
received by satellite have been jammed in Iran since Friday [17 
June], viewers said here Saturday. 
However the jamming of some 30 European, American and Asian 
channels has not been publicly announced. 
  Viewers said programs received via the Asia-Sat and Arab-Sat 
satellites had been garbled more or less depending on the 
district, with parallel lines appearing on TV screens. The 
jamming follows debate in Iran on whether or not to ban 
satellite dishes, which have mushroomed on rooftops in Tehran 
and other cities allowing up to two million people to view 
foreign broadcasts. 
  Under pressure from Islamic conservatives and hardliners, 
parliament is soon to debate the issue as part of moves to check 
Western cultural influence. The jamming also came after Iranian 
state television announced it would broadcast the World Cup live 
from the United States in a bid to compete with the increasingly 
popular satellite programs. 
  A newspaper reported here Thursday that in a crackdown on 
"social corruption," authorities in Iran had seized 1,965 
television satellite dishes destined for Iranian consumers.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Al-Ghaylan Accuses Northern </F>
Delegation of Evasion To Gain Time"] 
  [Text] Cairo, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- In a statement to 
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT Ambassador 'Abd-al-Jalil al-Ghaylan, member of 
the South Yemen delegation, has accused the Sanaa delegation of 
coming to Cairo to waste the UN envoy's time, to gain time, and 
to give world public opinion the impression that it is 
responding to dialogue. 
  Al-Ghaylan commended AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, saying that it was 
right when it its front-page headline on the eve of the "Cairo 
dialogue" said "Collapse of Dialogue Between Two Parties," as 
though it is reading the Yemeni war like an open book. 
  Concerning what the southern delegation conveyed to the UN 
envoy, al-Ghaylan, who was Yemen's ambassador to Cairo when the 
war broke out, said: We stressed to Brahimi that the main 
mission is to discuss a cease-fire in compliance with Resolution 
924, which stipulates two points: an immediate halt to the 
fighting and then engaging in negotiations without any 
conditions. When Brahimi called for dialogue he was seeking to 
achieve this. 
  He said: But the brothers in the north said that the current 
dispute is within the framework of the Arab Republic of Yemen 
and thus a solution should be within this framework, and that 
the military committee should be within the same framework that 
existed before the war, or if it is to be expanded, this 
expansion should be on a limited scale by accepting the 
participation of both Syria and Morocco. He said that he and 
the UN envoy believe that there is no point in its [the northern 
delegation's] presence, and in addition there is the fact that 
the northern delegation to Cairo makes it a condition that 
negotiations be held within the framework of the Constitution of 
the Republic of Yemen. 
  Ambassador al-Ghaylan revealed to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the 
head of the northern delegation submitted a memorandum from 
Foreign Minister Muhammad Basindwah containing these points, 
saying that the north is willing to respond to the Security 
Council resolution within the partisan coalition framework that 
existed before the war. That is, a solution should be within 
the framework of the Republic of Yemen. He adds: The southern 
delegation's reply in this context was that the delegation came 
to Cairo to sincerely work to secure an immediate halt to the 
fighting. But it seems that the north has no desire to bring 
about an end to the fighting, and that the aim of their 
agreement to attend the meeting is to waste Brahimi's time so 
that his report would be delayed. 
  Ambassador 'Abd-al-Jalil al-Ghaylan said that throughout his 
stay in Cairo Brahimi tried to persuade the north that the Arab 
Republic of Yemen question can be addressed at a later stage, 
and that this is not the time to address it, especially as he 
had called for the Cairo meeting to discuss two points: to draw 
up a mechanism to halt the fighting and to initiate a dialogue 
and negotiations. But the northern delegation did not listen to 
Brahimi and submitted Basindwah's memorandum to him. 
  Concluding his statement, al-Ghaylan said: The outcome of 
the Cairo meeting is that the northern delegation refused to 
negotiate the terms for a cease-fire and the southern delegation 
agreed to halt the fighting first and then engage in a dialogue 
and negotiations.

  [Excerpts] Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, chairman of the 
Presidential Council; Brother 'Abd-al-Rahman 'Ali al-Jifri, 
deputy chairman of the Presidential Council; Brother Anis Hasan 
Yahya, speaker of the National Assembly; and Brother Haydar 
Abu-Bakr al- Attas, the prime minister, have addressed an appeal 
to the secretary general of the United Nations and to all 
regional and international organizations and bodies. The appeal 
says: 
  The Sanaa regime, as you know, has launched an attack on the 
people of the Democratic Republic of Yemen. It has destroyed 
villages, looted public and private property, and pillaged 
everything in the areas it has managed to occupy. Not even 
hospitals have escaped shelling and the theft of equipment which 
is subsequently dispatched to the north. The hospitals are then 
converted into weapons and ammunition depots. [Words indistinct] 
Ibn Khaldun Hospital donated by the fraternal State of Kuwait. 
[passage omitted] 
  The situation in all the occupied areas, particularly in the 
villages and the areas where battles have taken place, shows 
signs of a health disaster due to the northern forces' 
abandonment of their dead, who are left to rot. Sometimes they 
(?bury) them in an inhuman way by using tractors but the wind 
removes the sand covering them. Bodies are exposed causing a 
great deal of (?distress). The Sanaa regime, which is not 
concerned about its own citizens, alive or dead, cannot be 
concerned about our citizens and cannot be a regime [word 
indistinct] the destiny of our people. [passage omitted] 
  His Excellency Lakhdar Brahimi came as an envoy of the UN 
secretary general and we heard his initiatives with all 
seriousness. He did not need to waste his time with us. In 
fact he spent no more than 24 hours in the Democratic Republic 
of Yemen. He left the country after meeting the Brother 
President 'Ali Salim al- Bid, the brother prime minister, and 
his deputies in two meetings in which he found responsiveness to 
all his initiatives and proposals. He spent five days in Sanaa 
but was unable to convince the Sanaa regime to respond in a 
practical way to UN Security Council Resolution Number 924 or 
any other initiative. In Cairo he also spent two days trying to 
convince Sanaa about his initiative but to no avail, whereas he 
found from all of us responsiveness and serious [word 
indistinct]. [passage omitted] 
  In view of the foregoing, we appeal to the world, 
represented 
by the UN secretary general, international organizations, and 
all countries to move speedily with the aim of achieving the 
following objectives: 
  1. Stop the barbarous attacks on the residential quarters of 
Aden and the destruction of vital installations in which 
hundreds have been killed and wounded. 
  2. Put an end to this crazy war which has no justification 
whatsoever according to religion, law, or norms. The Sanaa 
regime is challenging the whole world by means of this war. 
  3. Effect a complete withdrawal from the territory of the 
Democratic Republic of Yemen and prevent any troop concentration 
on its borders. 
  4. Force this totalitarian regime to pay compensation for 
all the material and human losses it has inflicted on the 
people, territory, installations, and equipment of the 
Democratic Republic of Yemen. It was this regime which declared 
war and launched the aggression. It has continued its 
aggression, rejecting all international resolutions and appeals 
and challenging international legitimacy. 
  5. Provide urgent (?medical) treatment and assistance for 
our citizens in the areas occupied in the Governorates of Lahij, 
Abyan, and Shabwah; protect the citizens there from repressive 
measures, looting, and pillaging of their possessions and public 
property; and oversee and repair water and electricity services. 
It should be stressed that such assistance must not be provided 
through the Sanaa regime but under the direct supervision of the 
international organizations. 
  7. [number as heard] We ask the Arab and Muslim countries 
and the friendly countries of the world to recognize the 
Democratic Republic of Yemen as a sovereign and independent 
state and to accept its membership in all organizations and 
bodies -- regional, Arab and international -- since the Sanaa 
regime lost all lawful, constitutional, and international 
legitimacy after declaring war on our Republic and after 
rejecting all the resolutions and appeals from the international 
community. 
  The Sanaa regime cannot be trusted any more, even with the 
lives, possessions, and destiny of its own people in the north. 
How can we trust such a regime with our people in the 
Democratic Republic of Yemen? The Democratic Republic of Yemen 
is not a new thing, as it was, originally, a sovereign 
independent state. It attempted to set up a union with the 
Yemen Arab Republic neither committed itself to nor respected. 
It has now been confirmed that the Sanaa regime does not respect 
or uphold any local or international agreements and rules. 
Consequently it has lost all legitimacy and cannot make claims 
in the name of a previous unity, which it has itself destroyed, 
or under any other pretext. 
  The Sanaa regime is not the inheritor of any history or 
legacy or religion. It has not been mandated with this. 
Consequently the declaration of the Democratic Republic of 
Yemen is a return to an original position and not a new thing or 
an invention. 
  The Democratic Republic of Yemen is committed to the Arab 
League Charter and to the UN Charter as well as to all other 
international organizations. It is also committed to all legal 
agreements in force concluded during the period of the Yemeni 
Republic which apply to the territory and [word indistinct] of 
the Democratic Republic of Yemen. We pledge to preserve the 
interests of others in our country, and to cooperate and work 
seriously to achieve security and stability in the region and 
the world. 
  The international community bears a political and 
humanitarian responsibility vis-a-vis the situation in our 
country. We are confident that it will assume that 
responsibility to achieve and preserve the interests of people 
and their political, economic, social, and cultural rights and 
ensure security and stability in the region and the world.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Al-Dali Tells AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: We </F>
Urge United Nations To Move Yemeni Crisis to Chapter VII"] 
  [Text] Cairo, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali 
(southerner), head of the Yemeni Socialist Party External 
Relations Department, has urged the United Nations to move the 
crisis from Chapter VI to Chapter VII of the Security Council 
Charter in order to stop the genocide operation planned by 
Sanaa. In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT al-Dali stressed 
that Sanaa has -- thus far -- not complied with the cease-fire 
resolution. Despite its promises to UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi 
and its talk about accepting the formation of a cease-fire 
committee, yesterday morning it shelled residential areas of 
Aden to terrorize the inhabitants. 
  He said that Sanaa is fully aware that it -- and it is the 
one escalating the fighting, thus inviting the the Security 
Council to impose the toughest of sanctions -- is not entitled 
to accuse the Arab states or Aden of exposing the region to the 
threats of a large-scale war, as Aden has until this moment been 
calling for peace and for halting the fighting. 
  On the results of his visit to the United States, he 
stressed 
Washington's and the United Nations' interest in a stable 
situation in Yemen, in the implementation of Resolution 924, and 
in giving the parties the opportunity to comply with it.

<F P=106> [Interview with 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, former president of </F>
south Yemen, by Shadiyah Riyad; place and date not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Riyad] Mr. Muhammad, UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi has 
left for New York to submit a report to UN Secretary General Dr. 
Butrus-Ghali. Which side do you think he will blame for his 
mission's failure? 
  [Muhammad] First of all, I would like to thank Cairo radio 
for its concern and attention to the events in Yemen and its 
objective reporting of the news. I also wish to thank His 
Excellency President Husni Mubarak for his concern for Yemen's 
security and stability. I believe it is still possible to 
contain the Yemeni crisis and that Brahimi's role has not ended 
yet. I believe he should continue his good offices. He will 
need help from the Arab League, the United Nations, the Arabs, 
and other concerned parties. Brahimi's mission is a worthy one. 
We hope his efforts will prove successful. 
  [Riyad] Mr. Muhammad, we know that you are in touch with all 
Yemeni parties. You have said that the possibility of ending 
the crisis still exists. However, the issue has gone before the 
UN Security Council for a second time. Does this mean it has 
reached a new, critical stage? 
  [Muhammad] At first, we hoped that the crisis would be 
handled among the Yemeni leaders themselves. I said earlier 
that the crisis should have been handled in a domestic context. 
We also hoped that the cooperation of the brothers in the 
region and the Arab League would help to settle the conflict. 
Regrettably the situation escalated and became more 
complicated. Speaking on Cairo radio at the beginning of the 
crisis, I warned of this escalation and said it would produce 
infighting and secession. The crisis has moved from the 
domestic Yemeni sphere to an Arab one and finally to the 
international sphere. Nevertheless we still hope that the UN 
secretary general and the Security Council will help Yemen to 
contain the conflict, stop the bloodshed, and bring stability 
and security to the country. 
  [Riyad] Mr. Muhammad, your remarks make me wish to ask you 
about the roles played by the Arab League and the fraternal Arab 
countries that are really concerned with Yemeni stability. Arab 
League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has asserted 
that the Yemeni crisis is not the responsibility of the world 
community alone but of the Arab world as well. 'Abd-al-'Aziz 
'Abd-al-Ghani, member of the Yemeni Presidential Council, has 
said, however, that he wants the issue to remain in the hands of 
the Yemeni themselves. He remarked that if foreign intervention 
stops, the Yemenis will be able to solve their problems more 
easily through dialogue. He noted that there had been nine 
months of dialogue before military actions began. 
  [Muhammad] 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani expresses his own 
viewpoint. I actually agree with him that the crisis was a 
purely Yemeni affair at the beginning. I stressed this several 
times, emphasizing that a solution should be found at home by 
the Yemeni leaders themselves. It is now known, however, that 
the crisis has moved from the domestic sphere to a regional 
sphere, to the Arab League, and finally to the United Nations. 
We would like our brothers and friends to cooperate with the 
Yemeni leaders to contain the conflict, reach a cease-fire, and 
restore dialogue to spare the Yemeni people further losses and 
tragedies. 
  [Riyad] Mr. Muhammad, do you believe that if Lakhdar Brahimi 
returns to the region, his mission will succeed? 
  [Muhammad] We wish him success but this requires sincere 
cooperation from the warring parties. I want to declare over 
Cairo radio that the problem is political and the solution must 
be political. Guns and missiles must fall silent. I said this 
from the beginning and called for a political solution. I 
believe that all the parties must offer concessions to make a 
solution possible. In fact, I am in touch with all Yemeni 
parties. I and some sincere people are seeking to help the 
Yemeni leaders and brothers to contain the conflict. I have 
some proposals that I hope will succeed, with some assistance 
from good people in Yemen and our brothers and friends abroad. 
  [Riyad] Have you submitted these proposals? 
  [Muhammad] I am continuing my contacts and consultations 
with 
all the parties concerned with the Yemeni crisis. 
  [Riyad] Mr. Muhammad, former south Yemeni president, thank 
you. 
  [Muhammad] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Al-'Attas Tells AL-HAYAH: Dialogue </F>
Is Impossible Before Cease-Fire and Disengagement of Forces"] 
  [Text] London, AL-HAYAH -- Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, prime 
minister of the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY], has denied 
the statements made by Yemeni Planning Minister Dr. 
'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani about Gulf states' intervention in the 
Yemeni conflict and their supply of arms to Aden. Al-'Attas 
hailed the results of his visit to Saudi Arabia, concluded 
yesterday. He said: "On the two visits I recently made to 
Saudi Arabia I found the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King 
Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz and all the brother Saudi officials very 
understanding. I can say that on this visit I am more 
optimistic about the future." Praising the Saudi position, he 
said: "The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia stands with all its 
capabilities [willing] to help our people in their current 
plight." He expressed the southern leadership's readiness for 
dialogue, but after a cease-fire and the disengagement of 
forces. He affirmed his rejection of the revivial of the 
military committee formed before the war broke out. 
  He urged regional and international organizations "to 
quickly 
provide urgent humanitarian aid for the Yemeni people in the 
Aden Governorate and surrounding governorates which are 
suffering from an acute shortage of medical supplies, food, and 
services as a result of the continuous shelling by the north 
Yemeni forces." 
  He called on the military command in Sanaa to "submit to the 
resolutions of the international community and to international 
legitimacy by stopping the fighting and implementing Security 
Council resolution 924." He stressed the need for 
"international forces to separate the warring forces if Sanaa 
does not comply with the Security Council resolution." He 
reaffirmed the unity of the south Yemeni leadership, the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP] leadership, and their alliance with the 
patriotic forces in the south." 
  He said that "the Sanaa regime has, since the beginning of 
unity, tried to divide the southern leadership and the YSP 
leadership. It failed in the past and it will fail now and in 
the future." He noted in this connection that "perhaps there 
are some people or some individuals with special circumstances, 
and, because of these circumstances, they take certain stands 
with the Sanaa regime." 
  On the question of international recogntion of the DRY, 
al-'Attas said: "Our efforts are geared to stopping the war 
first. There is great sympathy with our efforts. That sympathy 
reflects recognition of the reality imposed by the circumstances 
of the war. After a cease-fire is achieved and consolidated we 
will turn to the international matter of recognition." He also 
spoke about the "sympathy of some Arab states with Sanaa." He 
said that "some very few states sympathize with the other side 
without knowing the real situation. Some of them perhaps take 
that attitude because of special circumstances relating to them, 
but one day they will know the truth and will take the position 
they should be taking." 
  He expressed "satisfaction" with the U.S. position on the 
Yemeni war. He said that "the U.S. position is balanced and 
does not at all condone this war. It is against this war and 
does not approve of the imposition of unity by force. We are in 
contact with the United States and are explaining our views 
continuously. We believe that the U.S. position is balanced and 
helps toward the achievement of results that would, first and 
foremost, stop this war and consolidate the cease-fire so that 
we could move to the next phase, which is dialogue concerning 
the political situation in Yemen. That cause also concerns us, 
and we are ready for that phase which should come after the 
cease-fire, its consolidation, the cessation of the war, and the 
disengagement of the warring forces. Then we would be able to 
have an open-minded dialogue on the political situation, 
solutions, and ways out. [no closing quotation mark] Referring 
to his meeting in Jeddah with [the UN secretary general's envoy] 
Lakhdar Brahimi last Thursday evening, he said: "We resumed 
discussion of his mission based on our meetings with him in 
al-Mukalla last week. Brahimi had conveyed to us a proposal 
from the brothers in Sanaa regarding a military committee to 
supervise the cease-fire, but that proposal referred to an old 
committee formed before the war. It is clear that the war 
torpedoed all the insitutions which existed before and created a 
new situation. That is why we expressed complete willingness to 
search for an appropriate mechanism for the consolidation of the 
cease-fire and the monitoring of any violations which might 
occur, and that is in accordance with UN Security Council 
resolution 924. We explained to brother Lakhdar Brahimi our 
position, which included the following points: 
  "1. Willingness to discuss, with whoever is assigned by 
Sanaa, this matter...of finding a mechanism for the observance 
and consolidation of the cease-fire, provided the meeting is 
held in Cairo. 
  "2. That team (to discuss the cease-fire) should be formed 
in 
the context of implementation of Security Council resolution 924. 
  "3. The meeting of representatives of the south and 
representatives of the north should be held under the 
chairmanship or the supervision of Brother Lakhdar Brahimi, 
envoy of the UN secretary general. 
  "4. The meeting to be held in Cairo should be preceded by an 
effective cease-fire. 
  "We gave brother Lakhdar Brahimi the names of our 
representatives for that meeting. They are: Brother Muhsin 
Muhammad Bin-Farid, Brother Qasim 'Abd-al-Rabb, and Brother 
'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Bakri. We await the reply of the brothers in 
Sanaa." 
  He reaffirmed that the military committee was invalid at the 
present time. He said: "The old military committee is invalid. 
It was formed in certain circumstances before the war, and it 
was formed by an administrative decision and included brothers 
from some Arab states, that is from Jordan and Oman in addition 
to the U.S. and French military attaches, but the new 
developments and the war situation require something else." 
  He added: "We do not object to the old committee being part 
of the new committee to be formed, but the circle of 
participation must be enlarged to include the Arab League, the 
United Nations, and other states. We suggest participation of 
the rest of the Security Council members in the committee, and 
we suggest that a team of observers from states to be agreed on 
be attached to that committee. So, we are in favor of having 
this new committee, to be the new mechanism for the 
implementation of the Security Council resolution and to be 
attached to the representative of the UN secretary general."

<F P=106> [Report on an interview with Anis Yahya, "speaker of the </F>
parliament of the Democratic Republic of Yemen" by 'Adil 
al-Jawjari in Cairo; date not given] 
  [Text] Anis Yahya, speaker of the parliament in the 
"Democratic Republic of Yemen" has accused Iran, Iraq, and Sudan 
of providing military assistance to the northern Yemeni forces. 
  In an exclusive interview with AL-BILAD, Yahya said Iran had 
recently concluded a deal with Sanaa to provide it with Sukhoi 
planes. The planes arrived aboard a Yemeni-flagged commercial 
ship, which unloaded its shipment in the port of al-Hudaydah. 
  Yahya also said Sanaa was receiving Sudanese air assistance. 
He noted that Iraqi military experts are doing their bit in 
overseeing battles from an operations room that was created in 
the southern region of Abyan, under the control of northern 
forces. 
  Anis Yahya denied reports about Saudi and Kuwaiti military 
support for the southern forces, saying: What has been rumored 
about a Saudi military buildup on the southern Yemeni border 
represents northern allegations and fabrications. He said the 
weapons that arrived during the battles to southern Yemen from 
Asian and east European nations are part of a previous program 
to arm the southern army. 
  On the Sudanese and Iraqi prisoners which Aden said it had 
captured during the battles with the northern forces, the 
speaker of the southern parliament said: We are keeping them in 
a safe place, and we will show them at the right time to the 
international envoy Lakhdar Brahimi or any other envoy from the 
Arab League or the Islamic Conference Organization. He said the 
southern forces have seven non-Yemeni officer and soldier 
prisoners, five of them Iraqis, one Eritrean, and one Sudanese. 
He said the prisoners made full confessions about the presence 
of Iraqi forces and Sudanese and Eritrean volunteers with the 
northern forces. 
  On the course of battles in Yemen and the possibility of the 
northern forces breaking into Aden, Yahya said: There are 
50,000 southern fighters, supported by 30,000 tribal fighters to 
defend Aden by all means. There will be massacres if the 
northern troops enter Aden. He noted that more than 3,000 
people have been either killed or injured in Aden alone since 
the battles erupted. 
  Anis Yahya visited Cairo heading a southern parliamentary 
delegation that includes four deputies as part of an Arab and 
international tour. A rumor spread within the circles of 
Yemenis living in Cairo that the speaker of the southern 
parliament fled to Cairo after the northern leadership had 
sanctioned his killing, along with 13 others of the leaders of 
the Yemeni Socialist Party. Yahya replied to the rumors by 
saying: It is a northern rumor launched by the supporters of 
the northern General People's Congress who live in Cairo. I 
arrived in Cairo alone. My children are still living in the 
south. We are on a mission to expose the reasons that prompt 
Sanaa to continue the fighting. 
  [Al-Jawjari] In your opinion, what are the reasons? 
  [Yahya] Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, speaker of the 
"northern" parliament, the ally of President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih, wants to control the oil sources and refineries in the 
south to establish a state that will dominate the southern part 
of the Arabian Peninsula, and that will enter into an alliance 
with Sudan and Iraq to form an axis that threatens the security 
of the Gulf countries and Egypt. 
  [Al-Jawjari] If such a plan is real and not the figment of 
imagination, then when did you discover it? 
  [Yahya] Iraq was the first country to support unity. It gave 
united Yemen financial and material assistance. We used to 
believe that they were doing this because of their Ba'thist 
ideology. But, we found out that Presidents Saddam and Salih 
had made a deal under which Saddam would support Yemeni unity 
and Salih the Iraqi entry into Kuwait. This is what took place. 
  [Al-Jawjari] This means that the present conflict in Yemen 
is 
one of the chapters of the Gulf crisis? 
  [Yahya] Yes. We are now reaping the fruits of the policy of 
hegemony and imposition of influence under the pretext of unity. 
  [Al-Jawjari] But many in the Arab homeland do not believe 
that such a plan exists? 
  [Yahya] And who thought Iraq would enter Kuwait? We are 
living in an era where secret schemes suddenly materialize. 
  [Al-Jawjari] President Salih says that the YSP leaders are 
the ones who violate the cease-fire decisions? 
  [Al-Jawjari] Our reply is simply to refer to facts. 
President Salih exploited the cease-fire to bring in 
reinforcements to the battlefronts from the tribes and the 
Presidential Guard totalling some 100,000 troops over the past 
weeks. The northern forces received weapons and spare parts 
from Iran, Iraq, and Sudan to upgrade the effiency of the war 
machine on all fronts. From our side, we are eager to cease 
fire to reoperate the water and power plants in Aden which faces 
an environmental disaster. 
  [Al-Jawjari] There are reports that a vessel from Pakistan 
has recently unloaded its cargo in the southern Al-Mukalla Port. 
The cargo comprises 40 Russian tanks and 100 missiles. The 
question is from where have these come and who paid for them? 
  [Yahya] I was in Cairo when this report was published. I can 
neither confirm nor deny it. However, what I can say is that 
there are arms deals we have contracted a while ago. As you 
know, weapons are not delivered on the day the contract is 
signed, but later. Thus, I can affirm that no one finances arms 
deals for the south. 
  [Al-Jawjari] President Salih invited you five times to hold 
a dialogue. Why did you turn down the invitations? 
  [Yahya] Because there were conditions attached. Sanaa 
proposed certain names, and the nature of the topics to be 
discussed was still a subject of dispute. 
  [Al-Jawjari] Will you please give us some details? 
  [Yahya] Sanaa rejects the participation of 13 members of the 
YSP Political Bureau, including 'Ali Salim al-Bid, al-'Attas, 
the defense minister, myself, and others, in the dialogue. This 
is an unacceptable condition. Sanaa also set a condition that 
the dialogue be held within the framework of unity and the 
so-called constitutional legitimacy. This is rejected too 
because we represent an independent state and we are not part of 
the Republic of Yemen. 
  [Al-Jawjari] Your decision to secede was not supported by 
any 
state. 
  [Yahya] This is a question of time, and most probably 12 
Arab 
and non-Arab countries will support a decision to establish the 
Democratic Republic of Yemen when circumstances are appropriate. 
  [Al-Jawjari] Including the United States? 
  [Yahya] No comment. 
  [Al-Jawjari] And including the Gulf states, except Qatar? 
  [Yahya] No comment. 
  [Al-Jawjari] But Egypt voices its support for unity on 
condition that it is not imposed by force. 
  [Yahya] We, in the south, respect the role and the position 
of the Egyptian leadership. 
  [Al-Jawjari] Jordan also supports unity and calls for a 
cease- fire. 
  [Yahya] His Majesty King Husayn exerted extraordinary effort 
to prevent the conflict and infighting but the president and his 
allies have foiled Jordan's reconciliatory initiative. 
Jordanian military experts, who took part in the military 
committee, also say that it is the northern leaders who have 
aborted attempts to solve the problem. 
  [Al-Jawjari] You too aborted these efforts by insisting on 
the withdrawal of the northern forces from the south and the 
withdrawal of the southern forces from the north. This meant 
division. 
  [Yahya] We knew the dimensions of a plot to relocate certain 
units, which were outside the agreement and which could easily 
be struck if war erupted. This is what exactly happened when 
the 5th Infantry Brigade and the 3rd Brigade in 'Imran were 
destroyed and when the Ba Suhayb Brigade was besieged, after 
which war erupted. 
  [Al-Jawjari] What is the solution? 
  [Yahya] Cease-fire, disengagement of forces, and recognition 
of the independent southern state. 
  [Al-Jawjari] Sanaa's support for the secession seems to be 
impossible. 
  [Yahya] The continuation of unity in the previous way is 
also 
impossible.

<F P=106> [Interview with Anis Yahya, "speaker of the South Yemen </F>
parliament," by Sawsan Abu-Husayn in Cairo; date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [Abu-Husayn] Information indicates that the 
continuation of the Yemeni unity war could affect Red Sea 
security and threaten international navigation. Is Aden taking 
account of this? 
  [Yahya] Aden is complying with the cease-fire, and it is 
demanding day and night that the fighting be halted, because its 
continuation would inevitably affect Red Sea security and safety 
in the long term. Nevertheless, Aden has huge capabilities and 
an advanced naval force. But there is a need to coordinate 
efforts at the Arab and international levels to stop the war. 
Aden is standing fast and has the ability to stand fast for a 
long time. But the war's effects on neighboring states and the 
Arab region will be devastating. 
  [Abu-Husayn] But UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi spoke at the end 
of 
his tour of progress vis-a-vis the work of the committee 
supervising the cease-fire. 
  [Yahya] That is true. But we regret to say that Sanaa has 
denied Brahimi's statement and its acceptance of Aden's proposal 
regarding the work of that committee. Sanaa wants to revive the 
joint committee formed before the war which comprised Jordan, 
the Sultanate of Oman, and observers from the U.S. and French 
Embassies -- which we do not accept, because there is fighting 
going on now and its dangers are great, and it needs more 
intervention from the United Nations by way of adopting a strong 
resolution to compel Sanaa to halt the fighting. 
  [Abu-Husayn] Let us ask you about statements made yesterday 
by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his agreement to hold a 
dialogue with southern leaders but in the framework of the 
Yemeni Constitution: Do you accept that? 
  [Yahya] Yes, we welcome dialogue with president 'Ali Salih 
but in the framework of the constitution of the Democratic 
Republic of Yemen and the Pledge and Accord Document, which we 
consider a constitution for all the institutions of our new 
state, "the Republic of Yemen" [Jumhuriyat al-Yaman] [sentence 
as published]. However, I doubt what President 'Ali Salih says, 
because he contradicts himself every five minutes here and there. 
  I think that Sanaa is trying to get around Security Council 
Resolution 924 lest a new resolution is adopted against it after 
Lakhdar Brahimi submits his report. Nevertheless, we demand 
that the Security Council be convened again as soon as possible 
to work to implement its resolution. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with South Yemen Presidential Council member </F>
'Abd-al-Qawiyy Makkawi by Sawsan Abu-Husayn in Cairo; date not 
given] 
  [Excerpts] [Abu-Husayn] To begin with, will the dialogue 
between you and the north lead to unity again, or are there new 
proposed formulas? 
  [Makkawi] Unity is not subservience and annexation by force 
of arms, nor is it the return of a branch to the origin, as they 
say. Unity is equality, justice, and parity between two 
regimes. Unity can only be forged amicably in order to promote 
love and brotherhood, not the use of arms. And that can only be 
achieved when intentions are sincere and trust between the 
parties consolidated. As for recognition of the democratic 
state, it will inevitably and without doubt come from all peace- 
and stability-loving states, and it is not far off. 
  I have learned from consultations conducted between 
officials 
and the Security Council states that these states are currently 
consulting among themselves in preparation for announcing their 
recognition. If the other side continues to try to capture and 
occupy Aden by force, it is impossible for it to achieve that. 
The time of occupation, hegemony, and colonization has gone 
forever. Our people will defy death and bravely defend their 
land and fight the invaders to the last drop of blood. We have 
seen women, children, and young men carrying guns to defend 
their territory. 
  It is also noted that we have named the new state the 
Democratic Republic of Yemen. We have not called it the 
Republic of South Yemen. And we have appointed a number of 
northerners in the government -- which means that we have not 
ruled out the possibility of returning to unity, but on the 
basis of sound democratic foundations and a new formula based on 
reality. 
  [Abu-Husayn] If the fighting continues and the northern 
leadership backtracks on the dialogue, will you seek military 
assistance to rescue Aden? 
  [Makkawi] We do not want any foreign military intervention. 
We want to rely on ourselves, which is why we have formed a 
national defense council to take charge of the state of 
mobilization with a view to continuing the steadfastness and the 
defense. [passage omitted] 
  [Abu-Husayn] Russian President Boris Yeltsin said that a 
unified state could be stronger at the international level and 
better than partition. What is your opinion? 
  [Makkawi] I do not think so. I disagree with the Russian 
president. We are not against unity. We are still for unity 
and not against it, but in better conditions. It was President 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih who imposed partition through the war he is 
currently waging. Unity is not annexation. Actually the unity, 
which lasted formally for four years, had not been completed. 
For example, the currency, ports, civil aviation, and education 
curricula were not unified, nor were the Armed Forces 
merged...and above all, the war came to destroy what was left of 
the unity and to perpetuate secession. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah 
has blamed the southern leadership for the failure of efforts to 
resolve the Yemeni crisis. Basindwah, who toured the MBC 
Television building in London today, said that Aden refused to 
hold a dialogue within the framework of Yemeni unity. Basindwah 
told our colleague Hasan Zaytuni that Sanaa refuses to make any 
concessions to end the crisis. 
  [Begin recording] [Basindwah] First of all, I would like to 
say that the failure of political efforts so far is the fault of 
the separatist rebels. We agreed to talk to a delegation 
representing them within the framework of the Republic of Yemen, 
but they insisted on conducting the talks as representatives of 
the Democratic Republic of Yemen, which is so far unrecognized 
by any country. We cannot recognize the existence of any state 
on Yemeni soil, other than the Republic of Yemen. 
  [Zaytuni] Should we conclude from this that Sanaa is not 
ready to hold a dialogue in the framework of, say, a 
confederation or federation between the south and north? 
  [Basindwah] No one has the right to impose on our people any 
form of unity other than the merger formula agreed upon since 
the unification of the country. I am puzzled by those who 
refuse to understand that constitutional legitimacy does not 
permit anyone to impose a formula for unity other than the 
existing one. [end recording] [passage omitted] 
  For his part, 'Abdallah al-Asnaj, the foreign minister of 
the 
government declared in south Yemen, has said that the visit to 
Washington by southern Yemeni officials is designed to brief 
U.S. and UN officials on the latest developments in the Yemeni 
crisis. Speaking to us by telephone, al-Asnaj blamed Sanaa for 
the continued fighting, referring to what he said was Sanaa's 
procrastination in implementing the cease-fire. 
  [Begin al-Asnaj recording] The visit [to the United States] 
by Prime Minister Haydar al-'Attas and myself is aimed at 
ensuring that the UN Security Council and UN member countries 
are briefed on the true situation in Yemen. We hope to initiate 
efforts leading to an end to the fighting in Yemen. No region 
is more vital and strategic to international community than that 
of the Arab peninsula and the Gulf. 
  The UN Security Council will decide on a course of action. 
We in the Democratic Republic of Yemen simply want to give a 
true picture of the situation, the perils involved, and the 
external forces encouraging the Sanaa regime to keep the war 
going and to destroy south Yemeni towns, villages, and 
institutions. [end recording]

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council and supreme commander of 
the Armed Forces, today visited one of the camps of our Armed 
Forces. He was received by the brother commander of the camp and 
the officers. 
  During his visit, the brother president saw the progress of 
training and qualification programs at the camp and inspected 
the situation of the troops and NCO's. The troops expressed 
their happiness over the visit of the brother commander 
president, asserting their willingness to make sacrifices for 
the sake of the homeland and duty under all circumstances in 
defense of the will of the people to maintain unity and bolster 
their march and promote progress under democracy, which they 
chose as a way of life. They noted that there is nothing more 
precious than the homeland and its unity and that nothing 
deserves more precious sacrifices than maintaining unity. 
  The brother leader president spoke to the brother officers, 
NCO's, and soldiers, praising the enthusiasm, high morale, 
sincere national feelings, and overwhelming feelings of love for 
the homeland and loyalty to it, which are demonstrated by the 
brother members of the camp and all other sons of our Armed 
Forces. 
  He said this high national and moral spirit on the part of 
each individual in our valiant Armed Forces is a true embodiment 
of our just cause and of the noble principles and goals in which 
the sons of our Armed Forces believe and to which they are 
faithful. He noted that they do not fear death and do not 
neglect their duty under all circumstances. It was by this 
courageous national spirit that the heroes of our Armed Forces 
have championed the will of their people and foiled all schemes 
and plots against the homeland and its unity. They are today 
valiantly opposing the gang of apostasy and secession and 
defeating it all over Yemen. They are thus recording a new 
chapter of glory, heroism, and sacrifice for our people and our 
Armed Forces, which have always been faithful to the people and 
the homeland and have represented a bulwark that wards off all 
dangers and challenges. 
  The brother president noted the challenges imposed by the 
traitorous agents on the homeland and the seditions and sabotage 
they sought to ignite. He said the history of that criminal 
gang is replete with destruction and sabotage and that its 
conduct is marked by treason and plotting. Without this, this 
gang cannot live or have any existence. Our people have 
received nothing from this gang save death and destruction. 
  He added that the collusion, treason, and spite of this gang 
against the people and homeland have been exposed. This gang 
has a black history of oppression, suppression, and massacres by 
suppressing the people's freedoms and displacing qualified 
personnel of the sons of the homeland. Our people are today 
rising against this clique and are opposing its spite and 
trickery to maintain their unity, freedom, and democracy. They 
also seek to build their new society on the basis of justice, 
comprehensive development, and advanced local government that is 
founded on administrative and financial decentralization, 
respect for human rights, dignity, and property. 
  The brother leader president added that the heroic and 
great role which our Armed Force are playing in defending unity 
and constitutional legitimacy and in confronting those who have 
departed from that unity, legitimacy, and the free will our 
people demonstrated during the elections of the 27 April 1993, 
express our people's strong belief in and determination to 
safeguard the achievements and gains they made, thanks to their 
struggle, sacrifices, and efforts throughout the course of the 
Yemeni revolutions on 26 September and 14 October. 
  The brother president referred to the current criminal acts 
the rebel secessionist gang is committing against the people and 
homeland by targeting economic installations and civilian 
establishments and continuing its hostile, destructive policy, 
including firing Scud missiles against peaceful civilians, 
attacking the Aden refinery pipeline and the power generating 
station, and destroying electricity and water projects in the 
Lahij and Abyan governorates, the latest of which was the 
treacherous aggression against civilians and the power 
generating station in the airport. 
  This gang is also cracking down on and torturing innocent 
citizens in the brave city of Aden, where the supporters of that 
gang are forcing children, the elderly, and women to carry arms, 
plunging them into the furnace of death without fear of God and 
undeterred by conscience, ethics, or humanism. He also stressed 
that this criminal gang will not escape justice because it has 
committed acts of crime against the people and homeland, 
referring to the many opportunities the leadership has offered 
to those who were misled to join the ranks of unity and 
legitimacy and not to obey orders issued to them by that gang. 
  He then explained that those who were misled could still 
benefit from the general amnesty law and join the ranks of unity 
and legitimacy in order to end the shedding of Yemeni blood. 
Therefore, he said, they should take advantage of that before 
it is too late and before they regret what they have done 
against their people and homeland, stressing that our people and 
the Armed Forces, which have managed to overcome many challenges 
and backed the will of revolution, liberation, and independence, 
will not relinquish unity and will face that new challenge that 
is imposed on the homeland's unity and future. Victory will 
come, God willing, for our faithful, patient, and militant 
people and for the brave Armed Forces. 
  In his speech, the brother president praised the large-scale 
national rallying by the masses of our people, chief among which 
are political parties and groups, popular and professional 
organizations, and all political and social forces, which have 
faced up to their national responsibility and which have 
demonstrated a patriotic stand. 
  He also said that the challenge imposed by the gang of 
apostasy and secession on the homeland and its unity represents 
a real test to responsible positions and the principled 
commitment to the national constants. The brother president 
praised the great role Yemeni women played in supporting the 
defense of unity and legitimacy. He said that the generous 
donations, including food and money, which were offered by every 
mother and sister in the Yemeni family, represented a strong 
moral support for the heroes of our brave Armed Forces, which 
are waging the military operations against the rebels who have 
abandoned legitimacy. He also hailed our people's genuineness, 
their love for their homeland, and their adherence to unity as a 
great goal that cannot be relinquished, adding and that the 
homeland and its unity are worthy of all sacrifices.

<F P=106> [Report by Hani Naqshabandi: "Sanaa Rebuilds Socialist Party </F>
in North"] 
  [Text] Sanaa--High-ranking sources in the Socialist Party 
leadership in northern Yemeni governorates have said that the 
party is continuing the process of rebuilding its grassroots 
organizations right up to central committee level. But two 
points are still under discussion: 

  -  Determining the the legal and political status of the new 
formation, whether it is "a unionist extension" of the party, 
whose leadership is in southern governorates (Aden and 
Hadhramaut) at present, or whether it is a new organization 
completely separate from the Socialist Party with its known 
shape and formations. 
  -  Whether the new formation is going to rise structurally and 
organizationally from central committee level to political 
bureau level. This is in addition to the issue of selecting an 
alternative leadership to the leadership present in the south, 
whom Sanaa accuses of "secessionism and rebellion." 


    There is a heated debate among the party's members in Sanaa 
over their position toward 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the secretary 
general, and other leaders in general. Some middle-ranking 
cadres of northern origin are urging the speedy selection of an 
alternative leadership in a clear expression of the desire to 
seize the favorable opportunity to achieve personal ambitions. 
Meanwhile, high-ranking leaders of southern origin who happened 
to be in Sanaa when the war broke out are calling for patience. 
  It seems that a decision in this connection will be delayed 
for some time pending the outcome of the ongoing fighting 
between northern and southern forces, the attempts to secure a 
cease-fire, and the resumption of the dialogue between the two 
warring parties (the General People's Congress and Yemeni Reform 
Grouping, on one hand, and the Yemeni Socialist Party, on the 
other) 
  The situation will be determined in the light of an 
agreement 
on a new shape for unity. Then the new formation would become 
part of the process of rebuilding the party or a perpetuation of 
the secession between the north and the south, hence a separate 
party raising the banner of reachieving unity, thus becoming a 
tool in Sanaa's hand to shake the southern regime in the future. 
  This raises an important question about the position of 
numerous high-ranking leaders of southern origin who are in 
Sanaa at present and whether their current convictions "stem 
from the state of emergency" and could change when conditions 
change.

received Arthur Hayden Hughes, the U.S. ambassador to our 
country. During the meeting, they reviewed the friendly 
bilateral ties and the means of promoting them. They also 
discussed the efforts currently under way to establish a 
cease-fire. 
  The ambassador reiterated the U.S. position that what is 
taking place in the Republic of Yemen must be handled in 
accordance with the provisions enshrined in UN Security Council 
Resolution 924, within the framework of the Republic of Yemen, 
and with the inalienable rights guaranteed to all members of the 
world body by the UN Charter, chief among which are the member 
states' rights to sovereignty, independence, and territorial 
integrity, as well as the inadmissibility of interference in 
their domestic affairs. He added that any handling of the 
situation in the Republic of Yemen outside this framework would 
prolong the conflict and hamper the urgent solutions required to 
achieve security and stability in the Republic of Yemen and the 
region at large. 
  For his part, Deputy Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Anisi 
reiterated the Republic of Yemen's appreciation of U.S. efforts, 
noting their importance. He stressed the need for communication 
between the two countries to remove any misunderstanding in 
interpreting positions. He also underlined the need to keep 
away from anything that could hamper the joint efforts of the 
two countries in the interest of bilateral ties.

  [Text] Acting Prime Minister brother Dr. Muhammad Sa'id al- 
'Attar at noon today received (Robert Jejacques), member of the 
French Senate, and Mr. (Audois), secretary general of the 
Arab-French Friendship Society, who arrived in our country to 
express solidarity with the Yemeni people in facing the current 
circumstances. 
  During the meeting, they reviewed the current developments 
in 
Yemen and the efforts the institutions of legitimacy are making 
to preserve Yemeni unity. The French delegation voiced support 
for Yemeni unity as a basic factor in the region. The 
delegation members also voiced appreciation for the achievements 
the Yemeni people realized in the field of democracy by holding 
free elections on 27 April [1993]. 
  The French delegation gave Dr. al-'Attar a copy of the 
statement issued by the French-Yemeni friendship group at the 
French Senate on the Yemeni situation. The statement stressed 
the group's support for Yemeni unity and democracy and 
emphasized the need to preserve it. 
  Brother Dr. al-'Attar briefed the French delegation on 
overall Yemeni developments and the true situation in our 
country as a result of the war imposed by [Yemeni] Socialist 
Party elements who rebelled against legitimacy with the aim of 
undermining both Yemeni unity and the gains achieved by the 
Yemeni people, including the democratic achievements that the 
rebellious elements are trying to abort. Al-'Attar asserted 
that the war that the various groups of the Yemeni people are 
waging against these elements basically aims to preserve unity 
and democracy. 
  Dr. al-'Attar expressed our country's gratitude and 
appreciation for the position of both the French-Yemeni 
Friendship Society and the friendly French people on Yemeni 
unity and democracy. He pointed out that the Yemeni people and 
their leadership appreciate this principled position which 
expresses the true relations of friendship and cooperation as 
well as the historic ties between both friendly countries. 
French Ambassador in Sanaa (Marcel Lupin) attended the meeting.

country appreciates these stands and will reciprocate them in 
the future.

Yemeni-French Friendship Society and the Arab-French Friendship 
Society for our Yemeni people to safeguard unity and democracy

from internal conflicts. He noted that the Yemenis can resolve 
the crisis within Yemen and maintain Yemeni unity.

Ambassador 
to our country, and brother Muhammad (?al-Qatim), member of the

  [Text] (Robert Jejacques), member of the French Senate and 
deputy chairman of the French-Yemeni Friendship Society, left 
Sanaa this afternoon after a two-day visit to our country. 
During the visit, he met with several House of Representatives 
and government officials for talks on relations between our 
country and the Republic of France, as well as developments in 
the Republic of Yemen. 
  In a statement to the Yemeni News Agency, SABA', the French 
senator clarified that he had met with the brother House of 
Representatives speaker and the acting prime minister in order 
to assess France's position toward developments in the Republic 
of Yemen and to stress the need not to harm Yemen's unity in 
light of Security Council Resolution No. 924. 
  He said [words indistinct] the government in France of the 
Yemeni Government's position [words indistinct). The French 
official added that his country continues to support unity, 
legitimacy, and democracy in Yemen as part of the position the 
French president declared when he visited the Republic of Yemen, 
adding that this position will continue even under the worst 
circumstances, as is the case these days. 
  (Robert Jejacques) also expressed his admiration for 
democracy in our country, which was adopted as a result of the 
elections on 27 April 1993. He also voiced his admiration for 
the Yemeni people's adherence to their unity, and said that the 
dialogues he held with Yemeni officials and citizens show great 
confidence, popular will, and support for the legitimate 
government, which expresses the citizens' feelings. He added 
that this will help in developing Yemen and that because of its 
unionist and democratic trend, Yemen will occupy a leading 
position in the Arab homeland. 
  The French senator added that he met with the health 
minister 
and reviewed with him spheres of cooperation between Yemen and 
France in the health arena, particularly the lists of medicines 
presented by France. He also praised efforts [word indistinct] 
process to receive and distribute these medicines in record 
time--efforts that will encourage the dispatch of more medicines. 
  He was seen off by 'Abd-al-Hadi al-Hamdani, deputy chairman 
of the Political and Foreign Relations Committee of the General 
People's Congress; 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Rawhani, member of the 
House of Representatives; and Muhammad (?al-Qasus), member of 
the Board of Directors of the Yemeni-French Friendship Society.

  [Text] PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat this evening threatened 
to put off his visit to Gaza and Jericho due to the announcement 
issued by Rabin's bureau whereby the prime minister and the 
foreign minister instructed their aides to sever their contacts 
with Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi. Dr. al-Tibi, an Israeli citizen, played 
a prominent role in the contacts between Israel and the PLO as 
'Arafat's adviser. According to a legal opinion drafted a few 
months ago by Yo'el Singer, the Foreign Ministry's legal 
adviser, al-Tibi cannot take part in the negotiations because he 
is an Israeli citizen. 
  Our political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen has learned that 
there have been no official contacts with al-Tibi over the last 
few months anyway, and that today's announcement came after it 
was learned that al-Tibi and elements in the foreign minister's 
bureau continue to be in contact. 
  Al-Tibi argued this evening that he met a few weeks ago with 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in the latter's home despite 
Singer's legal opinion. Officials in the prime minister's 
bureau explained that anybody may speak to al-Tibi, but that he 
is not an official address for negotiations.

<F P=106> [Report by Yerah Tal] </F>
  [Excerpt] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres decided to call 
off a gathering of his supporters scheduled for today after 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin appointed him to head the 
negotiations with Syria, a very senior Labor figure stated 
yesterday. 
  According to this source, in the meeting the two men held 
yesterday Peres asserted that Rabin had largely blocked the 
Syrian channel to him. Peres told the prime minister that U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher had called off his visit 
to the region because he reached the conclusion that there had 
been no progress in the Syrian channel and that a mission under 
such circumstances would be doomed to failure. Peres stressed 
to Rabin that he could promote the negotiations and complete 
them within a few months. 
  Following these assertions, Rabin notified Peres of his 
decision to place him in charge of the negotiations with Syria. 
This decision paved the way to settling their dispute, and 
shortly afterward Peres informed the media that the gathering of 
his supporters had been canceled. 
  Peres said that he and Rabin were jointly steering the 
entire 
peace process, including the Syrian channel, and denied that he 
had voiced any complaints on the issue to Rabin. Nevertheless, 
a senior source associated with Peres confirmed that Rabin 
appointed the foreign minister to head the talks with Syria. 
However, the source noted, Rabin's move was not related to 
Peres' decision to call off the gathering of his supporters. 
  The conversation held by Rabin and Peres, some of which was 
attended by Labor Secretary General Nisim Zvili, allayed the 
turmoil in the Labor Knesset faction. The meeting of the 
faction yesterday afternoon was very relaxed, and none of the 
participants attacked the prime minister and criticized what has 
been happening in the party. The brief session ended after the 
faction endorsed Knesset Member Eli Goldschmidt's proposal to 
put off a debate on postponing the implementation or abrogating 
the law on the direct election of the prime minister to a later 
date, until the situation in the party calmed down. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] The Algerian-U.S. talks in Washington are continuing 
for the second day. Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri is 
expected to meet later today with a number of U.S. congressmen 
and to attend a meeting with U.S. academicians and 
correspondents which will be followed by a discussion. 
  Before that, the Algerian-U.S. talks have begun. The two 
countries' delegations were led, on the Algerian side, by 
Mohamed Salah Dembri and, on the U.S. side, by U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher. More details on this meeting from 
Abdelkader Djedid: 
  [Djedid] The meeting was an opportunity to dwell on the 
development of the situation in Algeria as well as a number of 
international topics. The foreign minister pointed out in a 
statement to APS that present Algerian policies, which fall 
within the framework of national dialogue and the installation 
of transitional institutions, were reviewed and explained at the 
meeting. 
  Mr. Dembri added that the U.S. secretary of state expressed 
satisfaction with the tangible results achieved so far, and the 
expectations from the current political program in accordance 
with the steps which are to be taken before the return to the 
electoral process, scheduled to take place within the next three 
years. 
  Replying to a question on the U.S. stand, which has 
repeatedly urged through official statements the need to broaden 
the basis of dialogue in Algeria, Mr. Dembri pointed out that he 
told his U.S. interlocutors that an open dialogue would need all 
parties and political personalities which wanted to take part in 
it in a tangible manner on the bases of the National Dialogue 
Conference. 
  As far as Algeria's economic reforms are concerned the 
foreign minister pointed out that there is great understanding 
for the steps which Algeria has taken so far and those expected 
to be taken, with international assistance, in order to give a 
fresh boost to the national economy.

  [Text] His Majesty King Husayn will hold summit talks with 
U.S. President Bill Clinton at the White House today. High on 
the talks, which will be attended by senior Jordanian and 
American officials, are Jordanian-U.S. ties and regional issues. 
  Earlier today, his majesty visited the Congress, and met 
separately with Speaker of the House of Representatives Thomas 
Foley, and the House Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Lee 
Hamilton, and 23 committee members. 
  The committee had asked for the meeting for a briefing from 
his majesty on the latest developments related to the Middle 
East peace process. Members of the House Committee said 
Jordanian-U.S. relations had developed after the Gulf war. They 
said they understood problems facing Jordan and many committee 
members said they would support Jordan in view of its positive 
stand toward the peace process and the democratic climate 
prevailing in the Kingdom. 
  His majesty told the committee that Jordan would act 
according to the agenda with Israel on the agreement two weeks 
ago on border demarcation, water, and security issues. His 
majesty said the agreement was progress towards peace, and added 
that Jordan will demand completion of other items on the agenda. 
His majesty told the House Committee it was premature to talk 
about the proposed confederation between Jordan and the 
Palestinians, and both peoples could choose the sort of 
relationship between them when the Palestinians gain their 
rights on their national soil. 
  Asked if Jordan would sign a peace treaty with Israel after 
the border and water issues are resolved, his majesty said 
Jordan would act according to the agenda, noting that Jordan is 
a sovereign country and an advocate of Arab coordination. 
  His majesty said a speedy peace treaty primarily depended on 
Israel's response to the requirements and conditions of peace. 
His majesty said lifting the Arab boycott against Israel 
depended largely on the results of negotiations ending the 
blockade of Jordanian goods bound for the occupied Palestinian 
lands, and a reconsideration of Israel's protectionist policy. 
  His majesty told the House Foreign Relations Committee that 
Islam is a religion of moderation, and fundamentalism was not 
restricted to Islam, but there were other extremist religious 
movements, and Islam should not be viewed through fundamentalism. 
  His majesty said Jordan would offer all possible support for 
the Palestinian administration in the autonomous areas. 
  Yesterday, his majesty met U.S. Secretary of Defense William 
Perry following talks with Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
and other U.S. administration officials. 
  During their meetings, both sides have underlined the 
closeness of bilateral relations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi by Nidal </F>
Mansur; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Mansur] Is the Muslim 
Brotherhood involved in terrorist activities? 
  [Al-Alfi] Charges have been brought against some of them and 
are being investigated. 
  [Mansur] Arab and Western intelligence services are said to 
have helped Egypt contain what you call fundamentalist and 
terror movements. Can you confirm this? 
  [Al-Alfi] There are no intelligence services working 
alongside us. However, we coordinate and cooperate through the 
international police or the Egyptian Foreign Ministry with some 
countries insofar as those who are wanted and those sentenced in 
their absence are concerned. [passage omitted] 
  [Mansur] The Muslim Brotherhood are excluded from the 
mainstream of national dialogue. Don't you think that, 
considering the group makes up quite a segment of the community, 
this detracts from the value of the dialogue? 
  [Al-Alfi] You say Muslim Brotherhood; are we a blasphemous 
brotherhood? 
  [Mansur] We are talking about a party with a political 
ideology. 
  [Al-Alfi] I am absolutely against the labels Muslim and 
non-Muslim; Egypt is an Islamic state where the sharia is the 
prime source for legislation. Do you regard millions as 
non-Muslim and restrict the adjective to those? This is 
unacceptable. 
  [Mansur] We are talking about a political party. 
  [Al-Alfi] These are not a party. The party is an 
organization described by the Constitution and law. If they 
want to be regarded as such, why not join the political party 
fold. We can engage in dialogue only legal and legitimate 
parties. 
  More to the point, it is wrong to found a political party on 
religious grounds, since all religions will then demand that 
they have their own parties. 
  [Mansur] You referred to Arab and Islamic repercussions on 
Islamic Egyptian groups. Have you documented proof to support 
your contention that terrorism in Egypt receives backing from 
Arab regimes or Arab Islamic groups? 
  [Al-Alfi] The matter is under investigation by the state 
prosecution. It does not serve our interests to name 
governments. However, obviously there are foreign hands 
involved. 
  [Mansur] You have hinted at the involvement of Sudan and 
Islamic groups in Algeria, but you ignored the role of certain 
Gulf states and Usamah Bin-Ladin, for example? 
  [Al-Alfi] I do not want to name names. The investigations 
are ongoing. It serves no one's interests for me to disclose 
our line of investigation. All facts will come to light when 
all the defendants stand trial in public. 
  [Mansur] How are the interests of the nations that you do 
not want to name served by such an involvement? 
  [Al-Alfi] We are the target of a ferocious onslaught waged 
not only by the misguided but also by vested interests who have 
joined forces with the former. They want to hurt Egypt as a 
superior economic force. By thus hurting Egypt they would 
intimidate the other Arab states. In any case, they will not 
succeed; the Egyptian people will spurn misleading ideas. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Mansur] The Islamists in Egypt maintain links with Afghan 
Islamists, who, in their turn, had links with the United 
Staters. Do you see American involvement there aiming to drag 
Egypt into sectarian conflicts so as to weaken your country? 
  [Al-Alfi] The United States supported Afghanistan not by 
virtue of the fact that it is an Islamic state, but did that 
within the context of an anti-communist effort. That support 
has now served its purpose. Let me here warn about what is 
happening in Bosnia and Herzegovina lest it be used to promote 
the same end. 
  [Mansur] Do you think Western powers, including the United 
States, have a stake in instability in Egypt? 
  [Al-Alfi] I will not name names. But there are those with 
an interest in a weakened Egypt on account of its strategic 
location, standing, and role. The aim also is to strike at 
tourism and lead the young section of Egyptian society into 
thinking tourism is a bad thing an anti-religious. Indeed, 
there are those who want to hurt us in any way possible and are 
using Islamists to advance that end.

  [Text] Jericho, West Bank, June 22 (AFP) -- PLO chief Yasir 
'Arafat, who was expected here by the end of June, will not be 
coming before the middle of next month, a senior Palestinian 
official said Wednesday [22 June]. 
  Colonel Jibril Rujub, head of preventive security in the new 
Palestinian self-rule enclave of Jericho, said: "The main reason 
for his delay is that the international donors are late in 
sending us the aid to start building our infrastructure." 
  But he also said political factors such as the Palestinian 
prisoners and Israeli security arrangements at checkpoints were 
also behind the delay. 
  'Arafat had been expected in Gaza and Jericho by the end of 
June. 
  Rujub refused to reveal the exact date of the PLO chief's 
arrival but said: "He is not expected before mid-July." 
  He said questions such as the release of thousands of 
Palestinians from Israeli jails "must be settled before he 
comes." 
  Israeli measures at checkpoints around Jericho must be 
addressed before 'Arafat's visit, he added. 
  Israeli soldiers on Monday stopped chief Palestinian 
negotiator Nabil Sha'th at checkpoints twice during a visit to 
Jericho. It took several hours for him to get through one and 
only then after the intervention of Israeli deputy chief of 
staff Amnon Shahaq. 
  Palestinian officials complain that Israelis are violating 
the autonomy agreement by holding them up at checkpoints.

  [Text] Damascus -- On the basis of a proposal by the 
Russian Embassy in Damascus, a secret meeting was held on 25 May 
in the Syrian capital between a high-ranking Russian delegation 
and representatives of the alliance of the 10 factions opposed 
to the peace agreements signed between the PLO and Israel. 
  The following is a summarized text of the minutes of this 
meeting with a prologue drafted by the participants, without any 
additions or deletions: 
  On the basis of arrangements by the Russian Embassy in 
Damascus, a meeting was held with Viktor Posuvalyuk, the Russian 
president's envoy and head of the Russian Foreign Ministry's 
Middle East Department, in the presence of Zutov, the Russian 
ambassador in Damascus, and Charge d'Affaires Bogdanov. On the 
Palestinian side the meeting was attended by brothers and 
comrades Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of the Democratic 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine; Abu-'Ali Mustafa, deputy 
secretary general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine; Talal Naji, deputy secretary general of the Popular 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine -- General Command; Khalid 
al-Fahum, leader of the Salvation Front; and Sami Qandil, member 
of al-Sa'iqah command. 
  At the beginning of the meeting, the Russian side stressed 
the friendly and comradely relations with the Palestinians. It 
lauded the role of national factions as forces who bear the 
responsibility of representing the Palestinian people. It also 
affirmed the Russian stance toward the present Palestinian 
situation and summed it up in the following points: 
  -- We believe that there are shortcomings in the Cairo 
agreement, but it is an important step in the right direction. 
  -- The PLO is an incomparable political vanguard which is 
representing the Palestinian people appropriately. 
  -- We are conveying our ideas to you as friends. Hence, we 
believe the following: Your disagreement with the PLO 
leadership will continue, but we hope that this disagreement 
will not turn into a conflict in which violence and force is 
used. An example of this is Yemen and what is happening there. 
All disagreements do not justify infighting. 
  -- The withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and Jericho 
and 
the entry of Palestinian policemen is a significant achievement. 
The attainment of the bulk of your rights will depend on the 
degree of Palestinian cohesion. 
  -- If all factions help President 'Arafat manage affairs 
smoothly and if you cooperate together, the scope of those 
rights will increase and vice versa. 
  -- We are convinced that Gaza-Jericho is the starting point 
and that more important ones will follow. 
  -- We received 'Arafat as president and acted in the same 
way 
toward Rabin in order to maintain the equilibrium. 
  The response of the Palestinian factions' representatives 
was 
as follows: 
  Hawatimah explained the situation with regard to the 
settlement track and pointed to 'Arafat's persistence in acting 
rashly, destroying the national alliance, striking at the 
national program, and excluding the institutions. He said: We 
were the first to initiate a national political strategy in 
support of international legitimacy. No one has remained with 
'Arafat except his party. Even those who participated in Madrid 
deserted him in Oslo and Cairo. 
  Abu-'Ali Mustafa said: We hope that you will not get the 
impression that opposition comes only from Damascus. It is a 
comprehensive popular state. 'Arafat and his team have chosen a 
path that will lead neither to rights, nor to peace, nor to 
security. They must bear responsibility for the disaster of the 
Palestinian cause. We will not deal with 'Arafat because not 
only has he deviated from the national program, but he has 
betrayed it. We are opposed to any rapprochement with him. As 
for the policemen, we have no police force or authority. All 
this is in the hands of 'Arafat and his team. You should tell 
him what you are telling us now. 'Arafat is currently facing 
three difficult political, economic, and security tests. 
  Al-Fahum said: Those who signed the agreement are facing a 
crisis and the opposition is facing a crisis also. Despite 
this, opposition to the agreement is greater. There is 
dissatisfaction with the agreement. Do not demand from the 
opposition something for which it is not responsible. Rather, 
demand that 'Arafat stop making concessions. We hope that you 
will play a more active role in the Middle East. 
  Talal Naji said: You have no role in the settlement. 
Everything that happens in the region emanates from the United 
States and Israel. You only promote that. I do not know why. 
You believe 'Arafat's lies about the opposition while he is 
preparing himself to play the role of the Palestinian Antoine 
Lahd. We will agree if you apply international legitimacy to 
the Palestinian problem, but you will do no such thing. Tell 
'Arafat and his group to stop threatening and heralding a new 
stage of suppression. Our people accept neither bargaining nor 
what the Oslo team has done. 
  Before the meeting ended, talk reverted to the head of the 
Russian delegation's remarks about the need to act under 
'Arafat's umbrella. Then Zutov, the Russian ambassador, hoped 
that the meetings would continue.

  [Excerpt] In protest against the criminal deed of ruthless 
monafeqin and mercenary agents of global arrogance in planting a 
bomb inside the holy shrine of the eighth Imam Reza -- peace be 
upon him -- various strata of the Muslim people of Zahedan, both 
Shiite and Sunni, staged a march today. 
  The Central News Unit reports that along the route of the 
march the mourners, by chanting such crushing slogans as "Death 
to America," "Death to Israel," "Death to hypocrites," "Today is 
the day of mourning," and "The leader Khamene'i is in charge of 
the mourning ceremony," renewed their eternal allegiance with 
the leader and the guardian of the Muslims' cause. They 
stressed their unbreakable unity. They also demonstrated their 
hatred and anger against this inhuman and anti-Islamic crime. 
  The concluding resolution of the rally, in part, while 
announcing readiness to obey and carry out the instructions of 
His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, the guardian of the Muslims' 
cause, says: We, the Muslims and border guards of the Sistan va 
Baluchestan Province, declare our heartfelt hatred against all 
enemies of Islam, particularly the hireling monafeqin, and we 
call upon the authorities of the Islamic Republic to punish the 
perpetrators of this heart-rending tragedy. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 21 (AFP) -- Fighting between 
Yemen's rival armies left 16 southern soldiers dead and 71 
wounded on Tuesday [21 June], while shelling of this port city 
killed three civilians and wounded 20, hospital officials said. 
  More than 1,100 northern soldiers and officers were killed 
or 
wounded as they tried to advance toward the southern stronghold 
on Sunday and Monday, a military spokesman said in remarks 
published here. 
  Heavy artillery battles continued to rage Tuesday on the 
front around Aden and the roar of multiple rocket launchers 
could be heard in the city. 
  Northern forces launched offensives on three fronts around 
Aden late Monday -- at Abyan, 25 kilometres (16 miles) to the 
east, at Sabir, 20 kilometres (13 miles) and Bir Ahmad, 20 
kilometres to the northeast. 
  They also hit Aden with shells and rockets, killing three 
civilians and wounding 19 in the northern suburbs near the 
frontline, hospital officials said. 
  Another person was wounded by a shell which landed in the 
city's central Crater district. 
  Shelling of Aden has killed 82 people and wounded 268 since 
Thursday, according the latest hospital toll.

  [Text] The forces of the ruling military regime today 
continued their desperate offensive attempts on all fronts, 
particularly in the direction of Aden Governorate. These forces 
also continued to shell, in a savage manner, residential 
quarters on the approaches to the capital, Aden. Our valiant 
Armed Forces confronted, and are still confronting with rare 
heroism and great steadfastness, all attempts by the forces of 
the ruling military regime to continue their defiance of the

continuing between our defending forces and the forces of the

adventurist head, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih.

  [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 22 (AFP) -- Fighting between the 
rival Yemeni armies and overnight shelling of this southern port 
killed another dozen people and wounded around 40, most of them 
civilians, hospital officials said Wednesday [22 June]. 
  Shells slammed into the Dar al-Amir suburb, which lies north 
of the city and just 10 kilometres (six miles) from the front, 
killing nine people and wounding 29, officials said. 
  Three dead soldiers and seven wounded were taken to 
hospitals 
here from Abyan, where southern forces have been resisting a 
northern offensive for the past two days. 
  Eight Katyusha rockets also hit the airport without causing 
damage on Wednesday as southern jets were taking off for raids 
on northern supply lines. 
  Two surface-to-surface missiles were fired at Aden on 
Tuesday 
evening, but one was intercepted by anti-aircraft fire while 
another landed in the sea. 
  President 'Ali Abdallah Salih's northern troops, and 
southern 
forces loyal to his rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid, have been locked in 
a civil war for almost two months.

  [Text] Cairo, 22 Jun (MENA) -- Arab League Secretary 
General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has renewed his call to the 
Yemeni belligerents to abide by the UN Security Council's 
cease-fire resolution to safeguard the lives of the Yemeni 
people and to enter into a constructive dialogue to promote 
security and stability for the fraternal Yemeni people. He 
expressed the Arab League's readiness to do its utmost to 
achieve this goal. 
  In an interview with the weekly magazine AL-MUSAWWAR 
published today, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that the fighting 
between brothers in Yemen has led to divisions and exacerbated 
the crisis. He expressed the hope that the two sides in Yemen 
will resume their dialogue as soon as possible. 
  Asked whether South Yemen has submitted an application to 
the 
Arab League to become an independent member, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid 
said: Yes, it did, but no action has been taken. The 
application is held in the General Secretariat until the Arab 
League Council holds its next meeting. 
  Asked about the internationalization of the Yemeni crisis 
and 
the fact that some states prefer to refer Arab problems to the 
United Nations, the Arab League secretary general pointed out 
that North Yemen was the one that first objected to Arab League 
mediation, because, as the Yemeni officials said, this is an 
internal matter. He said that North Yemen objected not only to 
Arab League mediation but also to UN mediation. 
  Regarding the Libyan-Western crisis and whether Libya has 
accepted the Arab League's proposal to conduct the trial of the 
suspects at the International Court of Justice in The Hague 
according to Scottish law and with Scottish judges, Dr. 
'Abd-al-Majid expressed his thanks to the Libyan leadership for 
accepting this delicate and sensitive political and legal 
situation. He noted in this regard that the recent Nonaligned 
Movement foreign ministers' conference in Cairo supported this 
initiative. He said that contacts have been held with UN 
Security Council member states and the European Union in this 
regard, and the atmosphere is completely suitable for discussing 
the means to achieve a peaceful settlement to this problem. He 
added that this will prevent an escalation of the Libyan-Western 
crisis in August, sparing the area further tension. He noted 
that a number of European countries who have interests in Libya 
do not want an escalation of the crisis and are ready to listen 
to Libya's views on the issue. 
  Regarding the embargo on Iraq, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid expressed 
hopes that the embargo will be lifted and that the Iraqi people 
will enjoy freedom, security, and stability. He said that 
everything is in the hands of the Iraqi Government. It can ask 
the UN Security Council to lift the embargo after it implements 
the UN resolutions, including those concerning recognition of 
Kuwait's sovereignty, the border demarcation, compensation, and 
the prisoners. 
  Regarding Israeli operations in Lebanon, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid 
said that what Israel has done and is doing against Lebanon is 
contrary to peace. He affirmed that Lebanon has the right to 
defend its territory and to demand the withdrawal of the Israeli 
forces. 
  He added that if Israel really wants peace in the area, it 
must stop its actions and embark on serious and effective 
negotiations to avoid operations by the Lebanese resistance, 
which is defending itself and trying to end the occupation. 
This, he said, is a legitimate right that applies to Lebanon, 
Syria, and the Palestinians, just as it applied in the past to 
Egypt before the liberation of its national territory.

  [Text] Cairo, 23 Jun (MENA) -- Arab League Secretary 
General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid today received Russian 
Ambassador Vladimir Polyakov. 
  The ambassador said later that on the instructions of the 
Russian leadership he had requested a meeting with the League's 
secretary general to exchange views on the latest developments 
in Yemen. 
  He pointed out that Russia and the League are cooperating 
and 
coordinating their stance on resolving the Yemeni crisis, noting 
that this cooperation takes a diplomatic and political form. 
  The Russian ambassador explained that when the war broke 
out, 
his country appealed to the warring parties in Yemen to stop 
fighting and initiate a dialogue to solve their problems. 
  Polyakov pointed out that Russia's recognition of south 
Yemen 
will depend on the findings included in UN envoy Lakhdar 
Brahimi's report to UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
on the crisis. He denied reports claiming that Russia is 
supplying south Yemen with weapons and assistance in view of the 
close ties linking Moscow with south Yemen in the past. 
  He said Russia halted all weapons supplies to the Yemeni 
parties when the Yemeni crisis began and before fighting broke 
out.

nothing but torture, vengeance, and the bald-headed serpent from 
the grave in our forgiving religion." He explains that these 
preachers graduate from al-Azhar and that all the ministry does 
is to distribute them throughout its mosques all over the 
country after training them. 
  He says he does not find it surprising that "some of these 
preachers are sometimes accused of being behind the waves of 
extremism and violence because of the issues and topics they 
raise in their sermons, which are often used as a source of 
income." 
  To handle the problem, Rajab suggests to al-Azhar that it 
develop curricula at its institutes, colleges, and schools. He 
stresses that other "educational, cultural, and sports 
establishments" must back the security apparatus positively and 
effectively. 
<H5>  PLAN TO FIGHT EXTREMIST THOUGHT </H5>
  A 300-word report by Muhammad al-Abnudi on page 2 states 
that 
"The Awqaf Ministry has prepared a new plan to refute 
extremists' allegations and fragile arguments by preparing 
counter-arguments in response to the books from which they draw 
their information." According to the report, a working group of 
18 specialized scholars in the various areas of thought will 
list the books the extremists read and provide counter-arguments 
for every point argued in these "suspicious books" that distort 
their thinking. 
  According to the plan, these specialists will teach the 
arguments to four groups totalling 120 imams working for Awqaf. 
The working group will start the search for these books on 15 
June and lessons will begin next week. The subjects to be 
studied, explained, and taught include the application of 
Islamic shari'ah, repudiation, apostasy, preaching good deeds 
and prohibiting evil, rulings on the permissibility of action, 
and the treatment of non-Muslims in a Muslim community. 
<H5>  U.S. COMPANIES' CONDUCT SEEN AS OFFENSE AGAINST MUSLIMS </H5>
  A 300-word report by Ashraf Abu-al-Hawl on page 21 claims 
that the famous McDonald hamburger restaurants and Coca Cola are 
committing a grave offense against Muslims by printing the Saudi 
Arabian flag, with its characteristic Islamic statement "there 
is no God but Allah and Muhammad is his messenger," on bags and 
soft drinks cans that are "dumped in wastebaskets or trampled 
underfoot" after their contents have been consumed. 
  YEMENI SCHOLAR FATWA BERATED 
  In the 500-word "In All Frankness" column on page 6 Basyuni 
al-Halawani maintains that "Yemeni scholars have indulged in a 
cheap game with some of them trying to plunge Islam into the war 
of grudges raging on the soil of sad Yemen," giving the enemies 
of Islam the chance to distort its image. 
  He notes that Dr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Daylami, dean of the 
al-Iman College at Sanaa University and a member of the supreme 
committee of the "northern" Yemeni Reform Grouping, has made an 
Islamic ruling on the "permissibility of killing children, 
women, and old people, burning and destroying public utilities, 
and seizing the properties of the southerners." 
  "If he really made that ruling, in the form published by 
some 
Arab mass media, then al-Daylami is not fit even to be a 
mu'adhdhin at a mosque, let alone a dean of al-Iman, faith, and 
college," al-Halawani contends. 
  He states that Islam has a clear-cut stance on "wars of 
grudges motivated by satanic whims" and that there is no need to 
plunge the name of Islam into such affairs. He regrets that 
"most Islamic states are afflicted with a type of scholar who 
always tries to employ Islam to serve the greed and ambition of 
some Arab rulers." 
  Stating that scholars' primary duty is to work to close 
ranks 
and eliminate grudges, he maintains that "those who volunteer to 
justify whimsical and criminal conduct that is rejected by 
Islamic shari'ah are accomplices to evil-doing and aggression 
and will burn in hell." 
<H5>  STUDY DRAWS ATTENTION TO IMPORTANCE OF CHINESE MUSLIMS </H5>
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Halim 'Uways writes in a 2,000-word article on 
page 6 about "Muslims in China: A big Minority Under Communist 
Control." 
  Citing conflicting statistics on the number of Muslims in 
China, he maintains that they are "no fewer than 80 million." 
He draws Muslims' attention to "enormous human resources" that 
deserve attention and care, stating that it is in the higher 
interest of Islam to be in the middle of that "ocean" of Muslims 
in a country that "might become the first or second power in the 
world." 
  Describing Muslims' social and cultural conditions in China 
as wretched, he goes on to identify a "pressing need to teach 
Muslims in China and the countries that were in the communist 
grip the basic principles that link them with the sound creed 
and pillars of Islam." 
  For this he suggests measures recommended by a study by Dr. 
Ahmad Anis, former vice president of the World Islamic Islamabad 
University. The recommendations include providing imams and 
Muslims in China with the necessary religious education, helping 
Chinese and other Muslims learn Arabic as a means of 
communication with the Islamic world, helping Chinese Muslims to 
build better Islamic academic establishments all over the 
country, organizing publications, seminars, and cultural, 
academic, and intellectual conferences, helping Chinese Muslims 
understand, preserve, and convey their culture and traditions, 
and helping them to become good, moral citizens. 
<H5>  OFFICIAL SEES JAPAN AS FERTILE SOIL FOR ISLAM </H5>
  A 600-word report by Tariq 'Abdallah on page 20 cites 
Muhammad 'Ashur Hamzah, manager of the Kubah Islamic Center in 
Tokyo, stating that "Japan is fertile soil for Islam if it is 
presented with the right image." Hamzah calls on Islamic states 
and institutions to intensify efforts to promote Islam in Japan 
by building mosques and Islamic centers and sending trained 
preachers who have been taught Japanese.

<F P=106> [Report by Fathi al-Barqawi: "'Arafat: Opposition Factions </F>
Request Participation in the Palestinian Authority"] 
  [Text] Tunis -- Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat has 
told about 30 members of Fatah's Revolutionary Council that some 
of the PLO's opposition factions are beginning to retreat from 
their hardline positions on the joint Declaration of Principles 
signed in Washington on 13 September. He added that some of 
these factions which had opposed the peace process are now 
asking to join the National Authority Council which has begun 
running the affairs of government in the Gaza Strip and Jericho 
area. 
  At an unexpected meeting of the Revolutionary Council, 
'Arafat urged the conferees to return to their homeland 
Palestine as soon as possible. He also told them that a World 
Bank delegation he met with last Friday suggested giving the PLO 
$10 million out of the $42 million agreed upon at a meeting held 
in the French capital Paris about two weeks ago, and that he 
rejected the offer which was a violation of what was agreed and 
which may be the main reason which has so far delayed 'Arafat's 
return to Palestine. The PLO is believed to be in dire need of 
the funds to make the necessary preparations for the work of all 
the institutions which almost begin from zero. 
  According to some members of the Revolutionary Council of 
Fatah, the largest Palestinian faction, 'Arafat, in a speech to 
the conferees, talked about the issue of human rights in 
Palestine. He said that the people who suffered occupation, 
coercion, and humiliation, hundreds of thousands of whom 
suffered detention in Israeli detention camps and some of whom 
were tortured and killed by Israeli soldiers, were entitled to 
full freedom in an atmosphere of democracy and partisan 
plurality. He stressed the need for the consolidation and 
development of the Palestinian Human Rights Committee which has 
so far been operating in Tunisia awaiting transfer to 
Palestinian territory. He said that the committee could be 
developed because it is closer to understanding the people's 
needs. That was seen as a veiled criticism of the Citizens 
Rights Committee headed by Hanan 'Ashrawi who had, for two 
years, worked as spokeswoman for the Palestinian negotiating 
delegation. 'Arafat put more emphasis on the need to provide 
two fundamental elements, namely security and bread, citing the 
Koranic verse "feed their hunger and safeguard them against 
fear." He said that the initial days of the Palestinian 
Authority in what is known as the autonomy areas showed that the 
Palestinian National Authority must start from zero in security 
and economic sectors, and even the simplest services. At the 
meeting, which was attended by Major General Nasr [Yusuf], 
commander of the Palestinian police forces, 'Arafat ordered that 
no Palestinian citizen should be arrested, not even on spying 
charges, without reference to the official authorities. That 
remark was aimed at some factions which are trying to set up a 
parallel authority. Major General Yusuf, who submitted a 
comprehensive report on security in Gaza and Jericho, spoke in 
detail about his experience since assuming his post, especially 
in the Gaza Strip. He listed the positive and negative aspects 
and stressed the need to control the situation and contain all 
problems. He said that despite the meager available resources, 
a good mechanism has been put into operation, thanks to the 
solidarity and support of the masses. 
  According to Fatah sources, 'Arafat gave instructions that 
the committees which had been formed by the Revolutionary 
Council at its latest session should begin their work. Three 
committees will in fact begin their work as of Saturday in his 
personal presence. They are the committees for the unification 
of organizational rules, assessment of available qualifications, 
and popular organizations.

  [Text] Palestinian sources in Tunis have informed our 
correspondent Yoni Ben-Menahem that PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat 
has issued instructions to the Palestinian security agencies in 
Gaza and Jericho to be in direct contact with him and that no 
agency should interfere in the affairs of another. 
  Our correspondent says that security offices were opened 
recently in Jericho in addition to the preventive security 
office headed by Colonel Jibril al-Rujub. Among these is a 
presidential security office headed by Abu-al-Tayyib, a former 
Force-17 commander, and a general security office headed by Amin 
al-Hindi. 'Arafat issued his orders in the wake of internal 
struggles between these agencies.

  [Text] Jibril al-Rujub, who is head of Palestinian 
security in the self-rule area, says Yasir 'Arafat will not come 
to Gaza and Jericho before the middle of next month. The reason 
for this is that the countries pledging aid to the autonomous 
regions appear to be in no hurry to make good their pledges for 
establishing an infrastructure in the areas. Al-Rujub said also 
that the issue of the release of Palestinian prisoners and IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] security procedures at checkpoints were 
contributing to 'Arafat's decision to delay his departure. The 
Palestinian security chief pointed to recent incidents involving 
PLO negotiator Nabil Sha'th. Al-Rujub said Sha'th was delayed 
twice at IDF security barriers and only allowed to move on after 
the deputy chief of staff intervened.

<F P=106> [Article by 'Awdah 'Awdah] </F>
  [Excerpt] Israel has informed the PLO that it has approved 
the return of 84 of the 104 members of the PLO Central Council 
[PCC]. The approved list of returnees includes Faruq Qaddumi, 
Mahmud 'Abbas, Sulayman al-Najjab, Jamal al-Surani, Taysir 
Khalid, 'Abdallah Hurani, Salim al-Za'nun, Ibrahim Bakr, 
al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahim, Khalid al-Hasan, Dr. Walid Mustafa, 
Ibrahim Abu-'Ayyash, and others. 
  It is noteworthy that the Israeli list of approved returnees 
excludes Palestine National Council [PNC] Speaker Shaykh 
'Abd-al-Hamid al-Sa'ih. 
  Also excluded are Taysir Qub'ah, PNC and PCC deputy speaker, 
and Muhammad Subayh, PNC and PCC secretary. 
  Five of the PLO Executive Committee members, who are also 
PCC 
members, have also been excluded from the approved list. They 
are poet Mahmud Darwish (independent), Bishop Iliya Khuri 
(independent), 'Abd-al-Rahim Malluh (representative of the 
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, PFLP), Dr. Samir 
Ghawshah (representative of the Popular Struggle Front) and 'Ali 
Ishaq (representative of the Arab Liberation Front). 
  It is also worth noting that Bishop Iliya Khuri is a 
deportee, while poet Mahmud Darwish was a citizen in the 
Palestinian territory occupied in 1948, but he left in the early 
seventies to join the Palestinian revolution. 
  Also excluded from the list were Abu-'Ali Mustafa and Ahmad 
Fu'ad, PFLP representatives on the PCC; Saji Salamah and Salih 
Zaydan, representatives of the Democratic Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine; Nasif 'Awwad, representative of the 
Arab Liberation Front; and Salih Ra'fat and 'Isam 'Abd-al-Latif, 
FIDA [Palestinian Democratic Federation Party] representatives. 
This is despite the fact that the names of FIDA 
representatives were mentioned in the Israeli authorities' 
recent lists of Palestinian officials. 
  The list also includes names of people who returned with 
earlier groups of deportees, including B'ir Zayt University 
President Dr. Hanna Nasir, 'Abd-al-Jawad Salih, Fa'iq Warrad, 
and Taysir 'Aruri. 
  AL-RA'Y has learned that the Palestinian leadership in Tunis 
has instructed its personnel to delay their return in order to 
arrange it in an adequate manner. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Roni Shaqed] </F>
  [Text] At the beginning of the week, Police Minister Moshe 
Shahal invited Faysal al-Husayni and Ziyad Abu-Zayyad to a 
meeting at the home of his assistant Moshe Sason in Rehavya, 
Jerusalem. Seemingly another encounter of the 
Israeli-Palestinian committee on Jerusalem affairs. This time, 
however, Shahal was not planning to hold a discussion, but 
rather to convey a clear-cut message. "The agreement stipulates 
that the Palestinian administration's institutions will be 
located in Jericho. That is where you belong. I warn you on 
behalf of the prime minister," Shahal stressed, "that if Orient 
House turns into a governing institution serving the autonomy, 
we will be forced to take action against it. Israel will not 
tolerate any independent Palestinian policing activities in 
Jerusalem. We will not hesitate to take punitive action." 
  Al-Husayni tried to defend himself. "We have no intention of 
establishing a governing institution, we plan to provide the 
residents with services and to maintain ties with consuls. And 
why should you have problems with our guards?" al-Husayni asked 
innocently, "Did we not refuse your offer of guns?" 
  The next day both sides flexed their muscles. Shahal 
dispatched four Border Police jeeps and placed them 
demonstratively at the Orient House gates, while al-Husayni, in 
an attempt to highlight the Orient House aims, invited all 
consuls based in East Jerusalem to a special briefing. On 
Monday night, al-Husayni organized a rally of solidarity with 
Jerusalem at Orient House, and on Tuesday afternoon, acting in 
perfect sync with the media, he invited East Jerusalem 
homeowners who had received house demolition notices, to lodge 
complaints against the Israeli orders. 
  On Wednesday morning, totally ignoring the political storm 
around Peres' letter on the issue of Jerusalem -- and perhaps 
for spite -- Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi announced the establishment of 
the Palestinian Citizens Rights Society in Jerusalem. The 
committee's headquarters are, of course, in Orient House. 
  Jerusalem is the capital of Palestine, the Palestinians 
announced even before negotiations on the city's future were 
launched. The PLO started investing efforts in strengthening 
the city's Arab-Islamic status as well as its political status 
as early as in mid-1970's. In early 1980's, dozens of 
institutions, organizations, and research bodies were ordered to 
launch operations inside Jerusalem; they were even granted 
appropriate financial backing. In parallel, the PLO invested 
ample funds to establish an alternative to the Israeli rule in 
the city. 
  The Israeli defense establishment was aware of the process 
even before the intifadah. Reports were written, warnings 
relayed, declarations made. In practice, almost nothing was 
done to block this political development. 
  When the Israeli public representatives woke up this week, 
it 
was too late. The facts that had been established in East 
Jerusalem made the city a Palestinian political center. 
  Faysal al-Husayni said this week that the battle for 
Jerusalem has been launched. "Al-Husayni is right," prime 
minister's bureau sources said, "it is a war for the city. The 
Palestinians will have no choice, they will have to honor the 
agreement and move all autonomy-serving Jerusalem institutions 
to Jericho." 
  Rabin did declare war on these institutions, but the 
publication of Peres' letter to Jorgen Holst, the late Norwegian 
foreign minister, bungled the issue. The Palestinians flaunted 
the letter, which legitimized the activities of East Jerusalem 
institutions established prior to the Oslo agreement. (By the 
way, no new institutions were established last year because of 
the PLO's empty coffers, not because of the agreement.) 
Moreover, the letter promised to encourage the development of 
these institutions. 
  The opposition -- most notably Beni Begin -- raged and 
fumed. 
Ari'el Sharon failed to understand the brouhaha. All these 
institutions were established in the Likud era, he said. The 
Orient House building acquired the status of the "nascent 
Palestinian government house" during the Likud era. 
  The building, owned by the al-Husayni family, was built at 
the end of the previous century. It was a lodge and a hotel for 
many years. In early 1980's, al-Husayni used it to house the 
Center for Arab Studies. On a Shin Bet recommendation, the 
Central Command commander used a special warrant to close the 
building at the beginning of the intifadah. In August 1990, the 
warrant expired. Those were the pre-Gulf-war days. The defense 
chiefs were so preoccupied with their fear of Iraqi Scud 
missiles that they forgot to renew the warrant. 
  In the wake of Baker's shuttle tour and the start of 
negotiations that were to lead to the Madrid Conference, Orient 
House assumed a patently political character. The "territories 
PLO" established its command in the building, which became the 
Palestinian delegation's official residence. It was used for 
working sessions and news conferences. It was -- and still is 
-- used for fax and telephone communication with the PLO. 
  The technical teams -- working groups, each of which was 
assigned a topic -- that were established as quasi-ministries of 
the incipient Palestinian government, were also stationed in the 
building. Computer and telephone systems were installed. 
Secretaries, clerks, and economic, administrative, and legal 
experts filled the rooms. The Palestinian diplomatic section, 
headed by Faysal al-Husayni, was also stationed in the building. 
Consuls based in East Jerusalem began making pilgrimages to the 
house. They were followed by Tel-Aviv-based ambassadors, 
foreign ministers, and foreign delegations. 
  About two years ago, after Faysal al-Husayni declared the 
establishment of the Palestinian shadow government, its members 
dispersed throughout the building. Since they now required 
security arrangements, a security officer was appointed. A 
fence was put up, an electric fence was installed. Fatah youths 
were hired as guards, becoming the first nucleus of the 
Palestinian police in the territories. On al-Husayni's 
recommendation, they were sent for special training with the 
Jordanian police, where they learned weapons handling. Nowadays 
the building is guarded 24 hours a day. All visitors, including 
reporters, are inspected by security guards. A large antenna for 
the Jerusalem-PLO wireless communication system was installed on 
the roof. 
  On 13 September 1993, the day the Oslo agreement was 
signed, the Palestinian flag was flown from the Orient House 
flagpole in a festive ceremony. It has been there ever since. 
After the Hebron massacre, it was lowered to half mast. When 
the Japanese foreign minister visited the building three weeks 
ago, the Japanese and Palestinian flags were flown side by side, 
in accordance with the rules of diplomatic etiquette. A 
parliamentary delegation from Turkey visited Orient House a few 
days ago and a joint cooperation agreement between Palestine and 
France was signed there 10 days ago. 
  This week, Prime Minister Rabin finally decided to put an 
end 
to this PLO enclave inside Jerusalem. He asked the attorney 
general to examine legal steps to stop the activities at Orient 
House. Rabin did not rule out the possibility of asking the 
Knesset to enact legislation barring any non-governmental bodies 
from conducting foreign relations from territory within the 
State of Israel. Rabin would encounter no problem in trying to 
pass such legislation. The Likud would give him its full 
support. 
  Defense establishment officials this week said: "It is true 
that this building was in operation before the Oslo agreement. 
The problem, however, is that its activities have been imbued 
with new content." The officials explained that "an attempt is 
being made, also as part of the internal Palestinian power 
struggles waged by Faysal al-Husayni, to strengthen the status 
of Jerusalem vis a vis Gaza and Jericho. Al-Husayni is also 
trying to set up a private police force." The officials 
cautioned: "One must be alert to these developments before it 
is too late." 
  Al-Hakawati theater -- the Palestinian national stage -- is 
a 
short walk away from Orient House. Although the hall was 
originally built for theatrical companies, it has mainly served 
as a national conference hall, sort of like a Palestinian 
version of Jerusalem's Binyeney Ha'uma hall. The Democratic 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP], Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement], women's and student organizations from all 
over the territories, as well as Fatah all hold conventions 
there. The theater blossomed during the Likud's tenure. Even 
then, the theater building, much like Orient House, attained a 
special status: the police never burst into the hall when the 
Palestinian flag was flown there, or when the Popular Front for 
the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] held its conventions. The 
policemen always stayed in the courtyard. 
  The offices of the Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation 
[PBC] 
are on an adjacent street. PBC Chairman Radwan Abu-'Ayyash, and 
his team of advisers are currently preparing Palestinian radio 
and television broadcasts. These broadcasts, of course, will 
not be restricted to the residents of Jericho and the Gaza 
Strip. This office also serves as the Palestinian government 
press office. For example, it is responsible for issuing 
special press cards to journalists, Israelis as well, who want 
to enter the Gaza Strip and Jericho. The office provides 
information services, and whenever necessary, transportation, 
translation services, and escorts. 
  The Palestinian economic office, PECDAR [Palestinian 
Economic 
Council for Development and Reconstruction], which is in charge 
of economic development and building the Palestinian economic 
infrastructure, is located in north Jerusalem, in the Dahiyat 
al-Barid neighborhood. This office is currently preparing the 
autonomy's budget and is already allocating sums that have yet 
to arrive from European countries and the United States. PECDAR 
is formulating plans, at this stage, for economic projects in 
the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
  The Palestinian medical infrastructure has also been set up 
in Jerusalem. It includes the Higher Palestinian Council for 
Health in East Jerusalem, the national al-Maqasid Hospital on 
the Mount of Olives, and the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, 
which is located not far from Orient House. The General 
Federation of Palestinian Charity Organizations, one of the most 
important institutions in Palestinian society in the 
territories, operates similar to the Israeli National Insurance 
Institute and channels contributions from abroad to the 
residents of the territories. The monies are transferred from 
the federation's offices in Jerusalem to local charity 
organizations throughout the territories, including in the Gaza 
Strip and Jericho. Bayt Hanina is home to the General 
Federation of Trade Unions -- the Palestinians' own Histadrut 
labor federation. 
  Palestinian housing affairs are handled by the higher 
Palestinian council on housing, which is located near the 
Israeli construction and housing minister's bureau. This office 
will soon receive a large budget for building in the Gaza Strip 
and Jericho. Recently, it has begun construction on a housing 
project near Jabalyah, using funds contributed by the EC before 
the Oslo agreement. In Jericho, land has already been allocated 
for the construction of a housing complex. 
  Jerusalem is also home to "al-Quds University," which, at 
this stage, only comprises several buildings scattered around 
the city. However, plans for the national campus have already 
been made. The higher education council also has offices in 
Jerusalem. Even Gaza's Islamic University has a liaison office 
in the eastern part of the city. The higher Palestinian 
councils on tourism, industry, culture, and information are all 
located in East Jerusalem. These constitute, for all practical 
intents and purposes, the ministries of the incipient 
Palestinian state. 
  Jerusalem also houses the Palestinian organizations which 
wage the political and public relations battles: the various 
research institutes, newspaper offices, the associations of 
Palestinian students and writers, the Palestinian Council on 
Foreign Relations, and a large computerized translation 
institute. 
  The United States and six European countries maintain 
consulates in East Jerusalem, which serve as conduits for the 
marketing of the political struggle. Naturally, it is easy for 
the Palestinians to maintain political activity in Jerusalem. 
Israeli law, which applies to Jerusalem, is far more flexible 
than the military orders in the territories. There are no 
curfews in Jerusalem. There is no army. The telecommunications 
systems are more developed. No restrictions are put on 
conventions and rallies as in the territories. 
  When Palestinian functionaries from Hebron, Nabulus, or even 
Gaza decide to launch a political struggle, not only against 
Israel but also within the domestic Palestinian arena, they 
prefer to do it in Jerusalem or conduct their battles through 
the offices in East Jerusalem. That is why Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi, 
seeking a prominent platform from which to attack 'Arafat, was 
provided with a stage in Jerusalem. 
  Not only the PLO is firmly established in the city. The 
PFLP's political headquarters, and its magazine offices are also 
in Jerusalem. The DFLP also has offices in town. The 
Association of Muslim Sages, which guides Hamas and grants 
religious legitimacy to its activities is also located in 
Jerusalem. The main office of QUDS PRESS, the London-based 
Hamas news agency, is quite near al-Husayni's house. 
  Each of these dozens of offices could be housed in a single 
room, but their combined presence is what gives them power. 
This state of affairs began a long time before Oslo; however, 
the continuation of the peace process, with the issue of 
Jerusalem at its center, has increased the level of Palestinian 
awareness with regard to the city. 
  For all this, one must also add Jerusalem's holy status in 
the eyes of all Muslims. Temple Mount serves as the focus for 
religious feelings which quickly turn to nationalistic 
sentiments on the ground. At the same time, there is the 
surrounding infrastructure of religious institutions -- the 
religious courts in the territories, the Waqf, and the Supreme 
Islamic Council -- which also transform the city into something 
approaching a Palestinian capital. 
  Defense establishment officials recently prepared a list of 
all the Palestinian offices and bodies. "If they wish to honor 
the agreement, they have to remove all the institutions which 
are not directly related to the Palestinian residents of 
Jerusalem," the officials said. "We are not asking them to 
vacate al-Maqasid Hospital or liquidate any local soccer clubs. 
However, the bureau of statistics, the economic office, the 
post office, and the offices for water and development must be 
located in Jericho." 
  Ziyad Abu-Zayyad, who also has an office in Jerusalem, 
claims 
that the Israeli policy is an attempt to alter the city's status 
quo. "These institutions are not new," he says, "they were 
there all the time, even before Madrid. One must remember that 
the agreement stipulates that the central institutions will be 
in Gaza and Jericho. As for the other institutions, which serve 
the general Palestinian populace and have nothing to do with the 
Gaza-Jericho First agreement, these can be in Jerusalem." 
Abu-Zayyad explains: "I am not talking about political matters 
but about institutions that serve a community." Abu-Zayyad goes 
on to firmly assert: "East Jerusalem will be the capital of 
Palestine. I am not saying that this will happen now, but it 
will become our capital in the framework of a peace agreement."

  [Excerpts] Dozens of sealed houses in East Jerusalem and 
the West Bank were unsealed on 17 and 18 June without the 
permission of the Israeli authorities. The operation was 
organized by Dr. Mubarak 'Awad, the head of the Palestine Center 
for Non-Violence. Palestinian political figures, who were 
invited to take part in the activity, failed to show up. The 
Israeli security forces did not attempt to stop the operation, 
nor did they station troops around the reopened structures. The 
organizers said they would continue their activities until all 
the sealed houses had been unsealed. [passage omitted] 
  The organizers claimed that up till now, at least 50 houses, 
which had been sealed up by the Israeli security forces over the 
past few years, had been reopened by activists in East 
Jerusalem, West Bank towns, villages, and refugee camps. The 
organizers said that approximately 1,300 houses had been sealed 
before and during the autonomy. 
  Al-Haq, the Ramallah-based Palestinian human rights 
organization, estimates that the number of houses sealed or 
destroyed since 1967 is approximately 2,000.

<F P=106> [Report by Ibrahim Humaydi: "Al-Shaqaqi: Our Cadres' </F>
Signing of Pledge Document in Return for Their Release Meant Use 
of `Legitimate License'"] 
  [Text] Damascus -- Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, secretary general 
of the "Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine" [IJMP] has stressed 
that the IJMP's cadres released by the occupation authorities 
did not sign a document promising to support the autonomy 
agreement, "although there was stipulation of a pledge not to 
use violence or terrorism." He said that the Palestinian 
security authorities released IJMP member Hani 'Abid "under the 
movement's pressure and prompt political action." 
  Al-Shaqaqi told AL-HAYAH that the Israeli occupation 
authorities "in fact released a very small number of IJMP 
members after dialogues and discussions in a mosque between 
leaders of the movement and after the detainees managed, through 
steadfastness, to change the text of the document, which now no 
longer stipulates support for the Declaration of Principles"; 
but he added that the document did include "a pledge not to 
resort to violence or terrorism." He said that the IJMP members 
"during interrogation and in court used to deny resorting to 
terrorism, on grounds of the interpretation of terminology and 
the use of violence, or because of interrogation procedures." 
  Last Thursday the Israeli authorities released 170 
Palestinian detainees including some leaders and members of the 
IJMP and the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas). Al-Shaqaqi 
said that "any pledge given was given in a personal and 
individual capacity and did not affect the movement's general 
policy or any of its principles which call for the continuation 
of jihad until the liberation of Palestine. Any personal pledge 
by any individual not to resort to violence or terrorism on a 
personal level would not affect the jihad's legitimacy." He 
added that a "limited number of brothers used what we call 
legitimate license after forcing the enemy to change a text 
which had included support for the Declaration of Principles." 
On why the Palestinian security forces released Hani 'Abid, Dr. 
al-Shaqaqi explained that 'Abid "had been arrested on the direct 
request of the Israeli authorities, as admitted by those who 
interrogated him. They got his name and photograph from Zionist 
intelligence." 
  He said that although the detainee was "a journalist and a 
politician, the interrogation mainly covered the IJMP's military 
operations in the autonomy areas. They wanted to keep him 
hostage until the movement signs an undertaking to stop military 
action against the occupation in those areas, but no one from 
the movement gave in to these terms. So, under the movement's 
prompt and active political pressure at home and abroad, they 
had to get rid of the problem by releasing 'Abid." The IJMP 
secretary general -- in reply to a question on the agenda of the 
central command of the alliance of Palestinian forces opposed to 
the Oslo agreement, which is scheduled to meet today -- said 
that the conferees would discuss "the latest developments after 
the Palestinian police's entry into Gaza and Jericho, affairs of 
the alliance which has been moving slowly in the face of 
fast-breaking changes, and our relations with some friendly 
states and forces." He spoke of the possibility of "discussing 
a political framework for the autonomy areas, which is the idea 
raised separately by more than one faction but opposed by 
others." He expressed the belief that "we need a high degree of 
frankness at that meeting, in order to be able to say clearly 
what we want and what we do not want in the autonomy region. 
Every faction should give a clear answer so that, if possible, 
we can come out with a common concept."

<F P=106> [Report by Ibrahim Humaydi: "Damascus: Khaddam and </F>
al-Shar' Meet With Hamas Delegation"] 
  [Text] Damascus -- Abu-Muhammad Mustafa, representative of 
the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) in Damascus, has told 
AL-HAYAH that a Hamas leadership delegation headed by Dr. Musa 
Abu-Marzuq yesterday met with Vice President 'Abd-al-Halim 
Khaddam and Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' separately. 
  Hamas sources said that the meetings, which were also 
attended by Hamas spokesman Ibrahim Ghawshah, Political Bureau 
Member Muhammad Nazzal, and Abu-Muhammad Mustafa, "covered the 
latest developments relating to the Palestinian question as well 
as Arab developments." The sources said that both meetings were 
"warm and serious. We expressed our appreciation of the Syrian 
position." 
  In a statement to AL-HAYAH, Abu-Muhammad Mustafa said the 
two 
meetings dealt with "the current situation and the role of the 
vital forces in facing what is going on. We heard their 
(Khaddam's and al-Shar''s) views and they heard ours. The views 
were responsive." He added that Hamas considered itself "to be 
in a confrontation trench as an organization and considered it 
(Syria) to be in the same trench as a state." 
  He said that the delegation of the Movement, which is 
opposed 
to the Oslo agreement, and al-Shar' "made a political assessment 
of the current phase, future possibilities, and the position of 
Hamas inside [the occupied territory]." He added: "We 
explained the position of the Movement inside accurately." He 
said that the discussions also broached the meeting of the 10 
[Palestinian opposition] factions held yesterday evening. "We 
acquainted the Syrian officials with the picture and with 
possible developments. There is a clear Syrian interest in the 
continuation of the Alliance of Palestinian Forces (opposed to 
the Oslo agreement) and the reactivation of its role." But the 
Hamas representative added that Khaddam and al-Shar' pointed out 
that "the matter is up to the Alliance." 
  Meanwhile, sources in the Democratic Front for the 
Liberation 
of Palestine, led by Nayif Hawatimah, have told AL-HAYAH that 
the meeting of the Central Command of the Alliance held 
yesterday evening "was devoted to discussing the latest 
developments in the occupied territory in light of the various 
interactions taking place in Gaza and Jericho, and the role of 
the opposition forces there." They added that the conferees 
also discussed "the question of the municipal appointments in 
the occupied territory and practical moves to foil these 
appointments."

  [Al-Faysal] In fact I am carrying a message from the 
Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques to His Majesty King Hassan II. 
As the practice has always been between the two leaders, 
consultation on all issues related to Arab issues becomes a

  [Text] Rabat, June 17 (MAP) -- King Hassan II asked the 
Moroccan parliament to elaborate `a national charter' on 
education defining the basic criteria of the Moroccan 
educational system to enable the Moroccan people be up to the 
present and future challenges. 
  In a letter to the parliament Thursday [16 June] that was 
read by adviser to the sovereign Ahmed Bensouda, King Hassan II 
underlined the key role played by education in economic, social 
and cultural development. He noted that despite the progress 
made, further efforts must be exerted to take up the challenges 
thrown at the sector. `Various shortcomings at all stages and at 
all levels are still characterizing our educational system', the 
sovereign said adding these shortcomings are the major reason 
behind the unemployment of scores of university degree holders. 
This situation, he explained, is due to the unbalance between 
the supply and demand in various socio-economic sectors on the 
one hand and to a deficient orientation and insufficient 
information of students on the other. 
  `Our educational system must be conceived in the frame of a 
comprehensive, coherent and future-oriented policy that must be 
very flexible and receptive to would-be adjustments', the 
sovereign pointed out calling for elaborating a policy able to 
meet both the current and future needs related to the economic, 
social and cultural changes Morocco is going through. 
  The education problem is complicated and must be addressed 
by 
all. It is a collective responsibility committing the state, 
parents, teachers and economic operators, King Hassan II said 
urging the parliament to devote a large part of the current 
parliamentary term to debates on the education problem and to 
try to draw the bases of a national policy in this vital field. 
`A general consultation must be engaged, without any exclusive 
nor exclusion, and far from any demagogic or partisan 
consideration', King Hassan II stated. 
  The sovereign said further he is confident that the mps will 
give evidence of patriotism, imagination, audacity and realism 
in elaborating this policy which must, the sovereign underlined, 
`preserve our identity and authenticity, define... the frame to 
train the Moroccan so that he be useful and efficient, at home 
and abroad, for himself and for the whole society'. 
  Our education must assert and consolidate the Moroccan 
personality and must be inspired from and based on the precepts 
of Islam, a religion of overture and tolerance, King Hassan II 
said adding `in this troubled period, it is imperative to 
educate and to train the Moroccan on the basis of the respect of 
his faith and to instil in him the spirit of Islam which accepts 
the other and rejects any domination will'. 
  Our education must also be targeted to take up the challenge 
of the 21st century, i.e. mastering the growingly complicated 
technological and industrial evolutions as it must enable the 
Moroccan to actively and efficiently participate in the economic 
and cultural development of the society. It is high time we 
drew lessons from our various policies to adjust our needs and 
ambitions to the available means...we must take into account the 
increasing budget burdens that might in the short run force the 
public finance to make choices detrimental to economic 
development and social dignity, the sovereign said before 
concluding `the Moroccan people is expecting you to present a 
frame of a national dimension, putting an end to the era of 
hesitation and fulfilling its legitimate ambitions'.

  [Text] Rabat, June 22 (MAP) -- The Moroccan cabinet Tuesday 
[21 June] held its weekly meeting under the chairmanship of 
Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation 
Abdellatif Filali to review the measures that must be made to 
implement the program expounded in the governmental declaration 
presented earlier this month to the parliament. 
  Filali said on the occasion that the government must grant 
priority to the sectors of justice, administration, employment, 
privatization, education and promotion of the rural world. 
After it thoroughly examined the various axes presented, the 
cabinet decided to take a number of administrative and juridical 
measures to implement the program. 
  During the meeting, Minister of Justice Mohamed Drissi Alami 
M'chichi made a presentation on the bills submitted to the 
specialized parliamentary committee for examination. The bills 
are meant to modify a number of laws on the organization and 
prerogatives of communal jurisdictions, on the creation of a 
special court to deal with cases of treason, corruption, abuse 
of power, and embezzlements committed by civil servants and on 
the penal procedure code. 
  Minister of Finance Mohamed Sagou on his part expounded the 
two bills he submitted to the specialized parliamentary 
committee for scrutiny. The first bill is related to the use of 
funds earmarked for the promotion of youth employment while the 
second amends the law on the granting of loans to people wishing 
to carry out some projects.

  [Text] Rabat, Jun. 17 (MAP) -- The issue of the missing 
people is a sensitive question that is exploited by foreign 
parties for ill-intending ends, Moroccan Human Rights Minister 
Omar Azimane said. Speaking at a question time at the 
parliament, the minister said his department is trying to settle 
the question of the missing with objectivity. 
  Azimane stressed the need for all the parties concerned to 
exert more efforts to take the necessary measures to preserve 
the dignity of the Moroccan citizen. The first findings on the 
question of the missing people show that there are three 
categories of missing. The first include 97 allegedly missing. 
These persons cannot be considered missing, he said. The 
second include persons released after detention, while the third 
category include six persons upon whom investigation are being 
conducted according to complaints of by their relatives and on 
the information published by national dailies.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by Hayim </F>
Zissowitz; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Zissowitz] Let me first ask you about the Syrian 
issue. Does the fear of an imminent war -- within three to seven 
years, as the prime minister put it -- justify or call for 
greater political compromises on Israel's part with regard to 
the Golan Heights? 
  [Peres] I do not think that was what the prime minister 
meant. We make compromises not out of fear of war but because we 
want to attain peace. 
  [Zissowitz] The prime minister's remarks sound like an 
attempt to prepare the people for a compromise on the Golan 
Heights. 
  [Peres] Yes, that definitely must be done. We began talking 
about a compromise on the Golan Heights at the Labor convention 
on the eve of the last Knesset elections. We did not conceal 
our position. We stated it loud and clear, and there is no 
reason to change those positions. 
  [Zissowitz] Does the fear of war determine or influence the 
positions presented by Israel in the negotiations and the pace 
at which it would like the negotiations to proceed? 
  [Peres] I do not think so. I think that what influences 
them is the desire to reach genuine peace for both sides. Three 
situations are possible: war, peace, and no war and no peace, 
which is the current one. The current situation exacts a heavy 
toll -- first and foremost: a frenzied arms race. Some people 
estimate that the Middle East spent $1 trillion on arms during 
the last decade. This is really scandalous. This deprived 
children of food and youths of education. What for? In 
addition, there is suspiciousness, kidnappings, exchanges of 
fire. Although this does not directly apply to the 
Syrian-Israeli border, such a phenomenon exists in Lebanon, 
where the Syrians have a say in a variety of issues. 
  [Zissowitz] You said we recently presented interesting 
proposals to the Syrians. Could you elaborate on those 
proposals? 
  [Peres] No, I am afraid I cannot. 
  [Zissowitz] Could you at least tell us through which channel 
these proposals were relayed, seeing that the Washington talks 
have not resumed? 
  [Peres] It is a very specific channel. We submitted our 
views on the way to attain an arrangement with the Syrians to 
the Americans. I would like to reiterate that this arrangement 
consists of three interrelated and parallel issues: security, 
peace, and withdrawal. There can be no arrangement with the 
Syrians based on their demand that we first answer one question 
and then proceed to discuss other issues. They want us to first 
answer the question about a total withdrawal from the Golan 
Heights and then to proceed to discuss other issues. That is 
totally inconceivable! 
  [Zissowitz] Is interesting proposals your description or 
that of the Syrians? 
  [Peres] It is my description. I do not speak for the 
Syrians. 
  [Zissowitz] Has there been any response on their part? 
  [Peres] There has been no response conducive to a 
breakthrough. I think the Syrians want to pursue the 
negotiations, but their response has not been enough to enable 
us to launch real negotiations. We keep talking about the 
nature of the negotiations. After all, how can one normalize 
relations without normalizing the negotiations? Let us tell it 
like it is: In this day and age, negotiations are public. 
Today every citizen is a diplomat, and rightly so. He listens 
to the radio, watches television, analyzes what he hears, and 
wants to be sure. We are the representatives of the people. We 
are not a small ruling clique, as is the case in other places. 
  [Zissowitz] Are there any secret contacts with the Syrians? 
  [Peres] No, and I am sorry about that. This element is also 
missing. With regard to all the talk about credibility or about 
keeping the situation obscure: In all peace negotiations, there 
is a part that is covert and shrouded in mystery. It cannot be 
otherwise. All the initial positions cannot be revealed 
publicly. 
  [Zissowitz] Has Israel proposed to the Syrians, via the 
Americans, to hold a secret meeting between the prime minister 
and President al-Asad? 
  [Peres] I do not know about a secret meeting. After all, we 
say publicly and openly that we are prepared to hold a meeting 
at any level whatsoever, from the level of the president and the 
prime minister through the cabinet level; there must be a 
diversity of levels. Let me say this humorously: In the end, 
it is only the political level that is entitled to make 
mistakes. Peace cannot be attained without committing so-called 
mistakes -- that is, without raising new and creative ideas, 
without trying to look for ways to overcome various obstacles. 
Having taken part in the negotiations with the Palestinians, 
let me tell you that this means endless days and nights of 
working on different ideas, of confrontations, and of ups and 
downs. This is the way it is. This is the nature of 
negotiations, considering that we start out with very deep 
differences, with long-standing mistrust, with a suspiciousness 
that has almost become second nature, and with a great deal of 
skepticism on both sides as to whether genuine peace and a 
different type of relations can be attained. As far as I am 
concerned, I have no doubt that there is no alternative to 
peace, neither for the Syrians nor for us. 
  [Zissowitz] The government today marks two years in power. 
Could you estimate whether the signing of a peace treaty with 
Jordan or with Syria can be expected next year? 
  [Peres] Look, I cannot make any prophecies. At best, I can 
predict 50 percent of the story. I can reasonably assume that 
this is definitely possible, but I cannot say that with 
certainty. It is very hard to decipher what really happens in 
Syria or what goes on in the Syrian president's mind and heart, 
and it is even more difficult to guess or make predictions. 
  [Zissowitz] Is a meeting with King Husayn or a visit to 
Israel and Jerusalem expected to take place soon? 
  [Peres] I very much hope so. There are hardly any problems 
between us and Jordan that cannot be resolved. In my opinion, 
Jordan and Israel are wasting time and money for no reason. We 
could have made the economies of both countries prosperous and 
turned our border into a blossoming area. 
  [Zissowitz] Well, let us look inward. After two years in 
power, what do you consider the government's most stinging 
failure? 
  [Peres] I do not think there has been any stinging failure. 
Let me say it fair and square. Here we have an exceptional 
combination of three things: a peace process, continued 
immigration to Israel, and continued economic growth. This is 
an exceptionally strong combination. Forget the blaring 
headlines and empty talk. 
  [Zissowitz] Nothing has failed? 
  [Peres] That would be an exaggeration. There have certainly 
been failures, which is only natural. I am talking about the 
really big things. Paradoxically enough, I think today the 
Jewish people is experiencing one of its peaks, perhaps one of 
the highest in its history. On the other hand, it is facing 
great dangers. My God! At the peak of our strength, we are 
being threatened by dangers unprecedented in our history. 
Incidentally, these are more of a spiritual than of a physical 
nature. Our problem is the survival of our people and our 
Jewish identity in the face of assimilation and our shrinking 
numbers. I would even go so far as to say that while the Jewish 
state is experiencing spring, the Jewish people is experiencing 
autumn. 
  [Zissowitz] Thank you very much, sir. 
  [Peres] You are welcome.

  [Text] The opposition has sharply reacted to the prime 
minister's remarks about a possible war with Syria if a 
territorial arrangement is not attained with it. 
  The Likud says that the prime minister's remarks reflect a 
lack of wisdom and signal to the Syrians that Israel is 
capitulating to their threats and is willing to cede security 
assets. Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that the Likud is 
demanding that Mr. Rabin submit to the Knesset all the proposals 
that have been relayed to the Syrians recently. 
  Tzomet says that the prime minister is sapping Israel's 
resistance. Moledet says that Mr. Rabin, who has to date talked 
about peace, is now speaking about war, which is a clear sign of 
his failure.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Peres says that Israel has 
conveyed several interesting proposals to Syria, and if they are 
accepted, a breakthrough will ensue. Minister Peres did not 
specify the content of the proposals, although he noted that 
they focused on the need to conduct negotiations in three 
interlinked and interdependent spheres: peace, security, and 
border pullback. 
  As for negotiating venues, Minister Peres does not think 
substantive negotiations can be held on what he termed the 
narrow path of the Washington talks. 
  He further said the negotiations should be opened up to 
high-ranking levels to the extent possible, and that they should 
be conducted away from the public eye. 
  Replying to our correspondent Ya'el Ayalon's question, the 
foreign minister said that Yasir 'Arafat has not submitted a 
request to visit Jerusalem so far, and for that reason, no date 
for his arrival has been set.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's remarks about the 
danger of war with Syria elicited sharp criticism from 
opposition members. The Likud, Tzomet, and Moledet factions said 
that it is most deplorable that the prime minister is attempting 
to prepare Israeli pubic opinion for a withdrawal from the Golan 
Heights through threats of war. Here is what Likud Chairman 
Binyamin Netanyahu had to say: 
  [Begin Netanyahu recording] What the prime minister 
apparently fails to understand is that the danger of war lies 
only in his blabbering about it. The reason the Syrians have 
not and will not fire the missiles they already possess at 
Israel is the simple fact that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
is sitting on the Golan Heights at zero-range from Damascus. 
These missiles will become a real threat only if the IDF 
withdraws from its positions on the Golan Heights. [end

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen] </F>
  [Excerpts] Prior to his meeting with U.S. President Bill 
Clinton in Washington today, King Husayn said he did not rule 
out the possibility of meeting with Yitzhaq Rabin in Bill 
Clinton's presence. Prime minister's bureau sources believe 
that a public Rabin-Husayn meeting is indeed to be expected in 
the coming months. Our political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen 
reports: 
  [Begin Rosen recording] [passage omitted] Although Husayn's 
remarks should be viewed also in the context of his search for 
military and economic aid from the U.S., Israeli evaluating 
elements perceive numerous new positive points in his remarks at 
the Washington news conference. [passage omitted] 
  Prime minister's bureau sources assess that a public meeting 
between the foreign minister and the Jordanian prime minister 
will soon take place, to be followed by a public meeting between 
the prime minister and King Husayn in the fall. Will Husayn 
sign a separate peace agreement with Israel? On this point, the 
assessment says he will not, that the king will take every 
possible step up to the formal act of signing an agreement.

  [Text] Haifa Port Director (Mandi Zalsman) has revealed 
that a team of Jordanian businessmen recently visited Israel and 
expressed interest in the facilities provided by the Port of 
Haifa to act, in the time of the desired peace, as an outlet for 
Jordan on the Mediterranean. 
  In statements to our correspondent Shafiq Mansur, the Haifa 
Port director said the Jordanians showed they are very well 
aware of the achievements scored by the port and the development 
projects there. The team asked if Haifa Port can provide 
services such as storage, shipping, and unloading of Jordanian 
goods and containers and if there was a plan to set up a free 
zone in Haifa Port.

<F P=106> [Report by Pe'erli Shahar] </F>
  [Text] Israel has agreed to recognize Jordanian 
sovereignty over territories in the 'Arava, especially in the 
Dead Sea area, even before the signing of an official peace 
treaty between the two states, political sources in Jerusalem 
confirm. These lands take up tens of thousands of dunams, which 
Israel annexed over the years in the wake of drilling for water 
and due to the flow of the Jordan River. 
  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said in recent interviews it 
must be acknowledged that the Dead Sea is not a fixed lake, but 
shifts several kilometers from time to time. 
  We recall that the Jordanians are demanding that territories 
spread over some 360 sq km, chiefly in the 'Arava and mainly 
uninhabited, be transferred to their sovereignty.

  [Text] Police Minister Moshe Shahal says that for the 
moment there are no plans to release Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] leader Shaykh Ahmad Yasin from prison. Answering 
questions in the Knesset, Shahal conceded also that there was a 
legal problem in enforcing any pledge signed by released 
Palestinian detainees not to return to terrorism. 
  In response to an appeal by Knesset members Sandberg and 
Ba-Gad, the minister said that he would raise at cabinet level 
their request to have Kakh members under administrative 
detention sign a similar pledge. If they then promise to desist 
from terror, they could be released.

Command commander, by Salman Tawil in Haifa on 22 June -- 
recorded in Hebrew with Arabic subtitles; processed from the 
Hebrew] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Tawil] Would you say the 
Hizballah use of Sagger missiles against IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] forces constitutes a new element in their combat tactics? 
  [Mordekhay] They have used Sagger missiles in the past. 
What we do find grave and unacceptable is that some of the 
gunfire came from inside houses, from inside inhabited areas in 
the outskirts of Tibnin. Their use of the civilian 
establishment, the residents, the houses, and the villages to 
shoot at us greatly contravenes previous understandings.

said Hizballah has recently sustained dozens of fatalities and

against Hizballah will continue, using all means available. Our

Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee the chief of staff said 
there has been a real decline in terrorism and disturbances in 
the Gaza Strip, and a certain decline in Judaea and Samaria, but 
noted that he would not count on that in the long run. He 
believes terrorism and disturbances in the Gaza Strip will 
continue to be on a low level, but might grow in Judaea and 
Samaria.

  [Text] In Qalqilyah in western Samaria security forces 
have captured an Islamic Jihad terror band. The five members 
are suspected of being involved in the murder of an alleged 
collaborator with Israel in the center of Qalqilyah several days 
ago. Security forces also seized three weapons, including the 
gun which belonged to the murdered man. One suspected member of 
the band is believed to have fled and taken refuge in Jericho.

  [Text] The military court in Nabulus has handed down 10 
life sentences to 'Abd-al-Rahim Hasan Shadid, a 24-year-old 
Fatah member from a village near Nabulus. He was convicted of 
eight counts of murder of Palestinians who were said to have 
cooperated with Israel and of wounding four others, as well as 
three counts of attempting to attack Israeli soldiers. Rifles, 
a machine gun, pistols, and grenades were found in his home. 
Shadid confessed and said he had no regrets about carrying out 
the violence. 
  Meanwhile, Fatah members serving life prison terms have been 
freed recently in the framework of the Cairo accord. One of 
them was sentenced to nine life terms for the murder of at least 
nine Palestinians on the grounds they cooperated with Israel. 
  [Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew on 23 June on page 16 
carries a report by David Regev adding: "Thirty-eight 
Palestinian terrorists who were released in the last few months 
as part of the agreement with the PLO and who resumed their 
terror activities have once again been imprisoned by the 
security forces. 
  ["Sources said the security forces are furious about the 
releases and their inability to keep track of the discharged 
prisoners, many of whom resume their terror activities."]

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Ministry Director General Uri Savir </F>
by Shlomo Ganor in the studio on 17 June -- recorded in Hebrew 
with Arabic subtitles; processed from the Hebrew] 
  [Text] [Ganor] Mr. Savir, what were the results of the 
fifth round of multilateral talks, which ended last night in 
Rabat? 
  [Savir] There were representatives from 14 Arab countries, 
the Palestinian Authority, Israel, the United States, Japan, 
Russia, and Europe. We decided on approximately 35 projects. 
We agreed to strengthen economic cooperation. We decided that 
the economy must be based on open borders and the free movement 
of commodities. For the first time, it was decided to establish 
a permanent Middle East framework, in which Jordan, the 
Palestinians, Egypt, and Israel would participate, to monitor 
various regional projects in the fields of transportation, 
tourism, and electricity. I believe that the main achievement 
of the Rabat conference was the sense shared by all the 
participants that through economic cooperation and by working 
together, we can develop the region. 
  [Ganor] What viable regional plans were agreed on? 
  [Savir] The main issue this time was tourism. A whole day 
was devoted to this subject. There are various facets 
pertaining to tourism. Work has begin on feasibility surveys 
for roads and railway tracks. During this round, the United 
States proposed a plan to promote civil aviation between the 
countries in the region. An instructional center will be 
established in Egypt to train qualified personnel to handle 
regional tourism. Swiss experts will prepare feasibility 
studies in al-'Aqabah, Elat, and Jericho. Approximately 1.5 
million tourists visit here each year. As peace draws near, 
these figures should rise to European levels. Similar projects 
are being formulated in the fields of agriculture and with 
regard to linking the region's electricity grids. Feasibility 
studies will soon be completed, and then we will have to attract 
investments from the private sector. This issue was discussed 
as well. 
  [Ganor] What time frames are we talking about? 
  [Savir] We are talking about uninterrupted work. Whenever a 
round of talks such as the recent one in Rabat takes place, 
attention is focused on the multilateral economic talks; 
however, experts now hold limited conferences on specific 
subjects -- whether it be tourism, transportation, or 
communications -- almost every week. These experts are about to 
complete feasibility studies. I believe that the crowning 
achievement this time was the unprecedented discussion on the 
establishment of a financial mechanism to finance these 
projects. Second, a conference with the participation of the 
private sector will take place in Marrakech in November, at the 
initiative of Foreign Minister Peres. These projects will be 
presented to the managers of the largest U.S., Japanese, 
European, and Middle Eastern companies, including Israel. An 
attempt will be made to attract them to invest here. The Middle 
East understands that it must function as a region, not just as 
Egyptians, Jordanians, and Israelis. If we do not coalesce as 
one economic region, the international community will not invest 
here, because the various regions of the world are competing for 
funds. 
  [Ganor] What is the probability of Syria joining the 
multilateral talks? 
  [Savir] That is hard to say. This decision is for Syria to 
make. At this stage, it has still not joined; however, 
representatives from the EC and Japan said that they visited 
Damascus on the eve of the Rabat conference and sensed great 
Syrian interest in all these projects. The Syrians asked the 
Europeans to return to Damascus to brief them on the results. 
Perhaps Syria is beginning to understand that the train has 
already left the station and that this opportunity must not be 
missed. Ultimately, not only will Syria contribute to the peace 
process, but the peace process will also contribute to the 
Syrian economy. I believe that the multilateral track has now 
become too important for any party to want to remain outside. 
No one can afford to remain outside. As I said before, 
however, this is a Syrian decision, and it is undoubtedly linked 
to progress in the bilateral talks. 
  [Ganor] In your talks with the Moroccan representatives, was 
there any agreement on how to translate the special relationship 
between the two countries into diplomatic ties? 
  [Savir] We were given a very warm welcome by the Moroccan 
Government. We held various talks. At this stage, there is a 
great deal of very positive normalization in our ties with 
Morocco, but we have still not reached the stage of formalized 
relations. We discussed the strengthening of economic ties. 
Look, one keeps on meeting Israeli tourists in Rabat. When we 
left, we ran into a delegation of 300 people at the airport. 
The Moroccan Manufacturers Association expressed its desire to 
formalize ties with its Israeli counterpart. Therefore, our 
relations are growing stronger. We are seeing the fruits of 
peace, although we have not yet established diplomatic 
relations. Let us fill in the contents first, and the framework 
will undoubtedly follow. 
  [Ganor] Thank you, Mr. Savir.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen] </F>
  [Excerpts] There has been a warming in relations between 
Israel and the Muslim countries of southeast Asia. Foreign 
Ministry officials from Bangladesh and Pakistan secretly visited 
Israel several weeks ago. Sources at the Israeli Foreign 
Ministry, however, do not expect the imminent establishment of 
diplomatic relations. Our political correspondent Imanu'el 
Rosen reports: 
  Bangladesh, a calamity-stricken Islamic country in southeast 
Asia, is one of the poorest countries in the world. Several 
weeks ago, an economic delegation from Bangladesh held a secret 
visit to Israel. This came a short time after a visit by a 
senior foreign ministry official from Dacca. Senior Israeli 
foreign ministry officials have expressed the assessment that 
Bangladesh, out of all the Islamic countries in southeast Asia, 
is the closest to establishing ties, perhaps even diplomatic 
relations, with Israel. However, even Prime Minister Khaleda 
Zia's government prefers to move slowly and cautiously while 
maintaining clandestine ties. 
  Indonesia, the largest Muslim country in the world, cooled 
off relations with Israel after the public meeting between 
President Suharto and Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. Although 
the two countries have economic and other ties, these activities 
remain covert. 
  Despite the fact that Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto 
still refuses to meet Israeli leaders in public, she permitted a 
senior foreign ministry official from Karachi to visit Jerusalem 
several weeks ago and meet with the prime minister and foreign 
minister. [passage omitted] 
  Even Afghanistan is in the picture; however, meetings 
between 
its representatives and Israeli officials have been limited to 
the United Nations building until now. 
  Back in Jerusalem, foreign ministry officials assert that 
all 
the meetings so far have been with low-level officials, not with 
ministers or heads of state. Nevertheless, Muslim southeast 
Asia is moving closer to Israel.

  [Text] A Yemeni delegation, led by Salim Salih Muhammad, 
assistant secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], 
arrived in Damascus today. The delegation was received at 
Damascus International Airport by Rashid Akhtarini, deputy prime 
minister for services affairs. 
  In a statement to a SANA correspondent, Salim Salih Muhammad 
said: Our mission is to brief our brothers in sisterly Syria on 
the latest developments in Yemen, particularly the fierce 
fighting between the northern and southern parties. We would 
like to acquaint President Hafiz al-Asad with what is really 
taking place, particularly the need for abiding by cease-fire, 
stopping the bloodshed, and implementing the Security Council 
resolution. Hence, he added, we ask our Syrian brothers -- in 
light of Syria's Arab and international influence -- to help the 
Yemeni people stop the fighting, implement the Security Council 
resolution, abide by the internal, Arab, and international will, 
and embark on dialogue.

<F P=106> [Interview with Nabil al-Mallah, minister of state for </F>
people's assembly affairs, by Ibrahim Humaydi in Damascus; date 
not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Humaydi] What results do 
you expect from U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's 
coming tour of the region? 
  [Al-Mallah] Israel is still procrastinating. I cannot see 
it being serious in the negotiations, particularly on the Syrian 
track. Israel dallies in the negotiations with Syria. I am 
therefore not very optimistic about progress in the negotiations 
on the Syrian track, but Syria is serious about the peace 
process in accordance with the basis on which we participated in 
the Madrid conference. President Hafiz al-Asad emphasized at 
the Geneva summit that Syria is ready for full and comprehensive 
peace in return for full withdrawal and that peace is Syria's 
strategic option. Syria is serious about that. 
  [Humaydi] After the Oslo agreement and the developments on 
the Jordanian track, how do you view Arab coordination? 
  [Al-Mallah] Regrettably, coordination is not at the required 
level. There should have been full and effective coordination 
between all parties concerned with the peace process. There can 
be no doubt that the present Arab situation is not reassuring. 
  [Humaydi] In your view, what effect does this have on the 
Syrian track? 
  [Al-Mallah] Any separate agreement would ultimately affect 
the entire peace process but Syria has fixed principles in its 
dealings. No separate agreement between Jordan and Israel would 
affect the Syrian position because that position is clear. 
Syria wants full withdrawal in return for full peace. I do not 
believe a Jordanian-Israeli agreement would change anything as 
far as negotiations between Syria and Israel are concerned.

  [Text] King Husayn of Jordan yesterday said in Washington 
that a public meeting between himself and Israeli leaders is 
possible before signing an Israeli-Jordanian peace treaty. The 
Jordanian king told journalists that such a meeting is not a 
taboo and that there is nothing to prevent such a meeting. 
  Answering a question on the subject of visiting occupied 
Jerusalem, King Husayn said: There is much speculation about 
this point. I hope circumstances will allow a visit to the holy 
places in Jerusalem. 
  King Husayn did not deny press reports that he and his crown 
prince, Hasan, met secretly with Israeli leaders. He said there 
were no public meetings. 
  A Jordanian official has stated that the first official 
meeting between King Husayn and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin may be convened in October on the fringes of the ceremony 
to mark the signing of the Jordanian-Israeli agreement on border 
demarcation. The official, who preferred anonymity, said that a 
final agreement on border demarcation between Jordan and Israel 
may be reached in October. The signing ceremony, which will 
most probably take place in Washington, will, he said, provide 
an opportunity to hold an official meeting between the Jordanian 
king and the Israeli prime minister. 
  The official said there is nothing to prevent public 
meetings 
between senior Jordanian and Israeli officials after the signing 
on 7 June of the Jordanian-Israeli agreements on a detailed 
agenda for the bilateral talks, which are expected to lead to a 
peace treaty. 
  The official said a meeting between Jordanian Prime Minister 
'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres will precede the meeting between King Husayn and Rabin and 
may take place soon, when substantial progress in the talks over 
borders is achieved. 
  The Jordanian Democratic Popular Unity Party, the Jordanian 
People's Democratic Party, and the Jordanian Arab Democratic 
Party have criticized the Jordanian-Israeli agreement on border 
demarcation, signed recently in Washington. 
  In a statement published in AL-HURRIYAH [published by the 
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine] yesterday, the 
leader of the Jordanian People's Democratic Party said the 
Israeli-Jordanian agenda is another step in the political 
capitulationist settlement plan and establishes the course of 
separate and bilateral solutions, represented by the Oslo-Cairo 
Agreement, or, in other words, dismantles what was left of Arab 
coordination for the benefit of Israel's separate dealing with 
each Arab state. He stressed that such a solution cannot be 
bilateral, but means, in political terms, the discussion of, and 
contribution toward, the process of settling the Palestinian 
refugees and displaced persons. The Jordanian bilateral drift 
in that direction falls within the context of the Israeli-U.S. 
policy that establishes the process to settle the refugees. 
  He said the Jordanian Government has placed the country in a 
dark political tunnel and establishes, with these policies, the 
course of subservience to the United States and the imperialist 
states and is avoiding the national solution and its Arab 
framework. 
  For his part, 'Azmi al-Khawaja, secretary general of the 
Jordanian Democratic Popular Unity party, said the Oslo-Cairo 
agreement came as a great surprise to Jordan and confused it, 
thus causing it to bless that agreement. In order not to lose 
its role in the settlement plan, or have it marginalized, it 
hastened to sign the 7 June Agreement in Washington separately, 
after the 'Arafat wing of the PLO had done so. 
  He stressed that the agreement is yet another infiltration 
in 
the front of the Arab-Israeli conflict and establishes the 
principle of separate solutions. It also violates Jordanian 
national rights, the refugees issue, Jerusalem, and has 
established the principles for the start of the process of 
normalization with Israel on the political, economic, touristic, 
cultural, and security levels. 
  Al-Khawaja said the agreement will affect the march of 
democracy, and that the grip around the opposition forces will 
be tightened. The agreement will also link the Jordanian economy 
to the Israeli economy. 
  Muhammad al-Bashir from the Jordanian Arab Democratic Party 
said this separate solution will not be any better than the Oslo 
Agreement. He warned that the new trends by the Jordanian 
Government will fragment Arab ranks even further and increase 
the Arab losses.

  [Text] Kathmandu, June 20 (AFP) -- The supreme leader of 
the ruling Nepali Congress party, Ganesh Man Singh, underwent an 
urgent medical checkup here Monday [20 June] after collapsing at 
Bharatpur airport, a party source said. 
  Singh, 79, was rushed to Kathmandu aboard an army helicopter 
from Bharatpur in Chitwan district, 160 kilometres (100 miles) 
southwest of here, after falling from a revolving chair and 
suffering a dizzy spell, the source said. 
  He had been on a political tour campaigning against Prime 
Minister Girija Prasad Koirala. 
  "The supreme leader has regained consciousness," the source 
said. 
  A team of eight doctors is looking after Singh while another 
group scanned the posterior part of his head and neck using a 
CAT-Scan machine to check for internal bleeding, said the source. 
  Many of Singh's sympathizers gathered outside the hospital 
to 
inquire about his condition.

  [Text] Kathmandu, June 21 (AFP) -- A new party was formed 
here Tuesday [21 June] by a group of Bhutanese to push for human 
rights and an independent judiciary in their homeland. 
  The Druk National Congress (DNC), made up of people from the 
north and eats of the country known as Druks, plans to fight for 
free speech, freedom from oppression, among other things, DNC 
Chairman Rongthang Kunley Dorji told a press conference here. 
  "You are all aware that these freedoms do not exist in 
Bhutan 
and it is this fact that has left us with no other recourse 
except to launch a body whose aim is to bring recognition of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Bhutan and also protect 
these rights under ... an independent judiciary," Dorji said. 
  "Due to lack of human rights and an independent judiciary, 
the situation in present day Bhutan has deteriorated to such an 
extent that the citizens are treated as 'oxen without horns' and 
forced to live under very oppressive conditions by the regime," 
he said. 
  Dorji said they had formed the party in Nepal instead of 
India as New Delhi has an extradition treaty with Bhutan. 
  "If we were found raising voice against the Bhutanese king 
or 
the government, we may be immediately deported to Bhutan to be 
handed over to the Bhutanese Government," he said. 
  More than 100,000 Bhutanese of Nepalese descent are 
currently 
living in refugee camps run by the United Nations High 
Commission for Refugees after fleeing their country following 
the imposition of laws forcing them to adopt Bhutanese customs 
or face punishment.

  [Text] President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari has called upon 
the government and the opposition to negotiate their political 
differences and sort out the important critical issues facing 
the nation. In an interview last night, he said what is needed 
now is for both sides to sit together and evolve a joint 
strategy to reach a consensus on such major issues as Kashmir, 
the nuclear program, and economic stability. 
  Refuting the opposition's allegation that he is biased, the 
president said he resigned from the Pakistan People's Party 
following his election as president because of an evident 
polarization in the country's political environment. Sardar 
Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari said the country's political structure 
is such that nobody can bargain on important issues of national 
interest. Matters relating to the country's security and 
economic affairs are fully under the government's control. 
  On the nuclear program, the president said that Pakistan's 
nuclear program is peaceful. He added that Pakistan has made 
several proposals to India, including the creation of a 
nuclear-weapons-free zone in South Asia. The president asked 
the United States and the United Nations to take note of India's 
expanding missile program, which could start a regional missile 
race. 
  Answering a question, the president said the armed forces 
played their role in conducting free and fair elections and they 
are in favor of democracy in the country. 
  On the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution [giving 
discretionary powers to the president to dismiss the government 
and dissolve the National Assembly], the president said he has 
expressed his desire to abrogate it many times.

<F P=106> [Report by Ahmad Muwaffaq Zaydan and Ra'fit Yahya from </F>
Islamabad and by 'Abdallah al-Haj from Jeddah: "Pakistan Foreign 
Minister to Saudi Arabia With Proposal on Afghan Crisis"] 
  [Text] Developments on the Afghan front accelerated 
yesterday, on the eve of the end of President Borhanoddin 
Rabbani's term. Pakistan has undertaken a new initiative to 
prevent a likely deterioration in the situation, now that 
opponents to Rabbani have threatened to launch a new campaign to 
isolate him should he insist upon retaining his position after 
the 28th of this month. Pakistani Foreign Minister Sardar Asif 
Ali arrives in Saudi Arabia today for talks on this subject with 
Foreign Minister Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal. 
  In a major parallel development, Afghani Prime Minister 
Golboddin Hekmatyar held a meeting yesterday at his office south 
of Kabul, with the ruler of the province of Herat, Esma'il Khan, 
after which the two sides agreed to launch an initiative to form 
a government of national unity within 12 days of the end of the 
Afghani president's term. Ismail Khan left in the evening for 
the capital to meet with Rabbani and to inform him of the 
initiative that would open the major roads to Kabul after 
verifying a ceasefire in its suburbs. 
  Informed sources in Islamabad report that the initiative of 
Ismail Khan, well-known for his impartiality, which has 
dispelled the specter of war from his regions, enjoys Pakistani 
support. The initiative stipulates the participation of all the 
mojahedin parties in the interim government, which will organize 
general elections as early as possible and disqualify the 
(formerly communist) militias from the new formula for governing. 
  Moderate Afghani sources did not rule out that the Pakistani 
foreign minister would show his support for the initiative, 
especially as Hekmatyar is a party to it, because of the support 
Islamabad still provides him. Afghani sources indicated the 
importance of the position stated by the Pakistani Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Akram Zaki, who emphasized the need for the 
Afghani president to stick to the agreement, in terms of the 
duration of his term, especially as the countries affected by 
the Afghani situation have backed the agreement. 
  Informed sources in Islamabad have told AL-HAYAH that the 
Pakistani minister will bring this subject up for discussion in 
his meeting with Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal. The same sources added 
that the Pakistani minister would emphasize, in the meeting with 
his Saudi counterpart, Islamabad's insistence that all Saudi and 
Islamic humanitarian aid to Afganistan be routed through its 
Pakistan's territory. 
  They thought it likely that this position would be the focus 
of debate among Afghani ranks, especially as Afghan officials 
believe that Kabul and Herat are capable of taking delivery of 
the aid from the Muslim world. Officials believe that the direct 
delivery of aid to Afghanistan will be of help in the speed and 
distribution to the needy, and in helping it to reach specific 
sites. 
  The Pakistani minister will discuss the efforts being made 
to 
achieve total reconciliation among the mojahedin leaders, with 
the officials he will meet in Saudi Arabia. 
  Afghani Government sources told AL-HAYAH that Saudi Arabia 
is 
inclined to expand the framework of participation for Afghan 
leaders in decisions to ensure its implementation. At the same 
time, Pakistan still sees Hekmatyar as the major player, and 
perhaps the only one, on the Afghan scene. This has influenced 
the positions of numerous Muslim countries who criticize the 
imposition of certain figures on the Afghan scene. 
  The fear of observers in a number of capitals affected by 
the 
Afghan question is that Pakistan will go too far in its pressure 
on Rabbani and its support for Hekmatyar, particularly if Ismail 
Khan fails to persuade the Afghani president to accept what the 
ruler of Herat and prime minister have agreed to. 
  An informed Pakistani source told AL-HAYAH that the 
possibility for holding a peace conference in Islamabad, and the 
formation of a transitional government in Kabul, would be among 
the 10 points the Pakistani foreign minister would discuss with 
Saudi officials. The source said that the proposed peace 
conference would be along the lines of the Islamabad conference 
held in March of last year. 
  The same source indicated that the Pakistani proposal was 
the 
same one Hekmatyar had advanced in a press conference held in 
Jalalabad (eastern Afghanistan) last Friday [10 June], and said 
it was a means for finding a comprehensive solution to the 
Afghan question. 
<H5>  Not Comfortable </H5>
  The Pakistani source reaffirmed that his country is not 
comfortable with the Afghani president's position, that he would 
remain in power until the end of this year, according to 
resolutions adopted by a local consultative council held at his 
invitation two years ago. In the press conference the day before 
yesterday, the Pakistan Foreign Ministry spokesman indicated 
that the Pakistani foreign minister would go to Jeddah to meet 
with the secretary general of the Islamic Conference 
Organization, Dr. Hamid al-Ghabid, to discuss the Pakistani 
proposals, and would then proceed to Iran with the same purpose.

  [Text] Islamabad -- Pakistan said Saturday [4 June] that 
by test-firing its short-range ballistic missile India has 
unleashed a race of sophisticated weapons in South Asia. 
  The Pakistani reaction came hours after India test-fired 
Prithvi, which can carry a payload of one ton up to 190 km (150 
miles), in the bay of Bengal. 
  "By test-firing the missile India has brought all major 
Pakistani cities, except the southern most city of Quetta, under 
its range," said Munir Akram, a spokesman for the Pakistan 
Foreign Office. 
  He said India was also looking for locations to test-fire 
the 
medium range Agni missile which can carry a payload of one ton 
up to 2,400 km. 
  On his return from a visit to the United States on Friday 
president Farooq Leghari told reporters that he has conveyed 
Pakistan's concerns to the US administration over India's 
efforts to deploy medium-and short-range missiles in the region. 
  "It is a new phase in the arms race in South Asia. It will 
now unleash a missile race in the region," said Akram. 
  The deployment of these missiles, according to him, will 
shorten the warning time of any surprise attack against Pakistan 
down to a few minutes "and, therefore, increase the hair-trigger 
environment in South Asia". 
  He said Pakistan has advised all countries concerned, 
especially the members of the Missile Technology control Regime, 
to urge India not to go ahead with the development and 
deployment of these missiles. 
  He said Pakistan had so far been talking to the United 
States 
and had established no direct contact with India over the matter 
"but we will consider other diplomatic options as well".

today, a Foreign Office spokesman described the murder of Qazi 
Nissar Ahmed as an act of terrorism which, he said, is the 
handiwork of Indian agencies. The spokesman said the Indian 
intelligence agencies have chalked out a sinister plan to

  [Text] United Nations, New York, June 23, (IRNA) -- Iran's 
Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati criticized the application 
of double standards and failure of a number of apparent 
advocates of the politically charged international campaign 
against terrorism to curb the activities of the terrorist 
Mojahedeen Khalq Organization (MKO). 
  In a letter to the U.N. Secretary-General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali 
submitted to him Wednesday [22 June] by Iran's permanent envoy 
to the U.N. Kamal Kharrazi, Velayati referred to the June 20 
terrorist bomb blast at the holy shrine of Imam Reza (as) in 
Mashhad. 
  He underlined that the failure of the advocates of 
international campaign against terrorism to curb the activities 
of the MKO terrorist group has not only encouraged the 
continuation of such acts of blind terrorism, but also put their 
own commitment to combat this international menace into serious 
question. 
  "The massive explosion caused the martyrdom of at least 26 
and severe injury of over 170 innocent pilgrims, including many 
children, elderly and women", the letter said. 
  It further called on the U.N. secretary-general to consider 
the General Assembly's Resolution 48/122 of 20 December 1993 
urging the international community to enhance cooperation in the 
fight against the threat of terrorism at national, regional and 
international levels. 
  Moreover, the eleventh ministerial meeting of Non-aligned 
Movement (NAM) held in Cairo urged that this international 
campaign should be directed without discrimination or 
double-standards against "terrorism wherever, by whoever and 
against whomever it occurs." 
  It is the responsibility of all states to live up to their 
international commitments in our common endeavor to eradicate 
terrorism, Velayati said. 
  He added that it was possible to eradicate terrorism through 
joint endeavor of all states by not only condemning this 
cowardly act of inhumanity, but also investigating whether their 
official institutions, their nationals or their territories were 
used by this terrorist organization for the commission, 
planning, financing, instigating or supporting this crime and 
take appropriate and effective measures accordingly.

  [Text] International and regional schemes aspiring to 
divide Yemen and revive its pre-unity conditions are making 
gradual headway. Tens of thousands have been killed, wounded, 
or displaced in Yemen, north and south. U.S. political 
pressure, aided and abetted by Arab regimes, is slowly but 
surely wrecking Yemen's national sovereignty and wrenching its 
land apart. 
  Keeping particular countries weak, in disgrace, and 
dependent 
upon foreign assistance is the hallmark of the policy the United 
States has been vigorously pursuing in the region since the oil 
[Gulf] war, a policy pursued even more adamantly in the southern 
Gulf states. 
  The United States recently imposed humiliating terms on the 
shaykhs of southern Gulf states, forcing their governments, not 
particularly known for a firm political will, to end the 
political and economic embargo of the Zionist, 
Jerusalem-usurping entity. 
  Stripping Arab states in the southern Gulf region of 
dignity, 
integrity, and political will has become a trademark of U.S. 
policy in that area. The corrupt regimes in Riyad and Cairo 
support this policy, dragging along, willy nilly, Arab League 
and Gulf Cooperation Council countries. 
  Seen from this angle, the U.S. position on the Yemeni crisis 
is easily explained. The United States wants Yemen weak, poor, 
divided, and, in both its parts, dependent upon foreign 
assistance. This is the subservient state in which the United 
States likes to keep most of the agent governments that do its 
gambling in the Middle East.

  [Text] United Nations, New York, June 23, IRNA -- Iran 
termed as false the testimony made by a U.S. official that there 
were no Iranian assets in the United States which could be 
released. 
  In a press release Wednesday [22 June], the Iranian mission 
at the United Nations stressed that several billion dollars of 
Iranian assets and properties in the United States have been 
frozen by the U.S. Administration. 
  U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near East Affairs 
Robert Pelletreau had falsely testified that the United States 
had no forzen Iranian assets except what might be available to 
the U.S. Claims Commission. 
  He made the statement in the hearing of the Europe and the 
Middle East subcommittee of the house of foreign affairs 
committee on June 14 in response to repeated questions about the 
existence of any Iranian assets that had been frozen in the 
United States. 
  The press release said that the fund which was made 
available 
to the (US) Claims Commission represented the settlement amount 
for the small claims, an issue totally distinct from Iranian 
assets frozen by the United States. 
  Terming the testimony as false, the press release said that 
apart from different types of Iranian properties which have been 
blocked in the United States, three major categories of Iran's 
assets are still in the United States which have not been 
released to Tehran and have neither been put at the disposal of 
the Iran-U.S. claims tribunal. 
  It added that the Iranian assets which are in the US 
include: 
(i) the remaining balance in the Foreign Military Sales Fund 
(FMS trust funds) (ii) Funds of Iranian diplomatic mission and 
(iii) balance of stand-by letters of credit issued by U.S. banks 
on the account of US companies in favour of Iranian Government 
entities, including but not limited to down payments, good 
performance guarantees and commercial letters of credit. 
  The press release also said that in addition to blocking 
some 
Iranian military and non-military properties including those of 
Iranian diplomatic missions, the United States has, in violation 
of its undertaking under the Algiers Accords, refused to return 
to Iran its remaining assets and continues to hold them in the 
United States. 
  It stressed that the total value of the items exceeds 
several 
billion U.S. dollars.

  [Text] King Husayn of Jordan, who was in Washington, has 
met and conferred with the U.S. President, Bill Clinton, today, 
Wednesday June 22. The two sides discussed the trend of the 
Middle East peace talks during their half-hour meeting at the 
White House, which took place on the invitation of the U.S. 
President. 
  King Husayn's private visit to the U.S. is taking place at a 
time when the Jordanian government delegation, during its June 7 
meeting with the Zionist regime delegation in Washington, 
reached agreements on defining the border lines, sharing water 
and economic issues. The agreements were reached during the 
presence of the U.S. representatives. Meanwhile King Husayn has 
also recently announced his willingness to meet the Israeli 
prime minister, Yitzhaq Rabin, and bilateral talks are expected 
to be held in Amman and Tel Aviv next month. 
  According to political experts, the fresh Amman-Tel Aviv 
agreement has come along with the U.S. and the Zionist regime's 
designs to create division among the ranks of the Arab 
countries. The Israeli regime in the wake of the Gaza-Ariha 
[Jericho] accord, which was signed last September, and in view 
of the opposition expressed by certain regional countries, has 
been trying to create division among the Arabs through different 
means and with backing of the U.S. In this connection one of 
the ways that the main ally of the U.S. -- that is, Israel -- is 
pursuing is to strike separate deals with each of the Arab 
countries secretly. 
  From the outset of the Madrid peace talks, the Zionist 
regime 
has tried to break the framework of the negotiations and have 
separate accords with each one of the Arab sides. The 
Gaza-Ariha accord was the first step taken in this regard and 
the recent accord between Jordan and Israel can be cited as 
being part of the same continuing trend. Political analysts 
believe that the continuation of such a trend is considered to 
be an all-sided pressure that Israel and the United States are 
putting on the other parties in the peace talks that do not 
agree with the trend. Therefore, although King Husayn is 
visiting the United States with the aim of activating the trend 
of peace talks with Israel, the trend of developments, 
especially during the recent months, speaks of conditions that 
favor Tel Aviv. 
  As a matter of fact what is being shaped is the continuation 
of the trend of compromise in which Israel will be taking more 
and more concessions from the Arabs.

  [Text] United Nations, New York, June 21, IRNA -- Iran held 
Baghdad responsible for the aggressions of Iraqi-based 
counter-revolutionaries on Iranian territory and said that the 
government of Iraq would be responsible for its consequences. 
Iran's permanent representative to the U.N. Kamal Kharrazi in a 
letter to the U.N. secretary general termed the June 4th 
infiltration of counter-revolutionary elements into the Iranian 
territory as explicit violation of the cease-fire between the 
two countries. 
  According to the letter, a number of counter-revolutionary 
elements crossed the border and penetrated 4 kilometres inside 
the Iranian territory in Ilam Province and opened fire on the 
Iranian forces on Eyn-Ghazal and south Halaleh road. As a 
result, two Iranians were martyred and four others, including 
one sergeant and three soldiers, were captured by them.

Council [SAC], which was chaired by President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani, approved the assignment to the private 
sector of part of the tasks of the government sector, 
particularly general and service tasks. 
  Under the approval, all ministries and government-affiliated

years to take steps to hand over general and service tasks to 
the private sector. 
  Under the approval all sectors can hand over their service 
tasks to cooperatives which have been set up with the

redundant. They are to afford them the necessary cooperation 
and give them priority when awarding contracts.

<F P=106> [Commentary by the News Research and Commentary Group] </F>
  [Text] With under a week left of Borhanoddin Rabbani's 
presidential term, no dazzling breakthrough that could indicate 
a closeness among the rival factions' stances on future policy 
or government in Afghanistan has been perceived. The only 
important step taken in this regard is the proposal by Deputy 
Foreign Minister Jalil Shams for a conference in Herat in which 
the representatives of every group, apart from General Dostam's 
representative, will participate to discuss Afghanistan's future. 
  This proposal has reportedly been ineffective due to 
differences of opinion on whether General Dostam's 
representative should attend. This issue, along with the stances 
of Golboddin Hekmatyar and Borhanoddin Rabbani on the manner of 
the transfer of power after Rabbani's presidential term, has 
aggravated the existing differences. 
  Political observers predict that if these difficulties are 
not resolved in the next seven days, when Rabbani's tenure of 
office ends, Afghanistan will witness more intense clashes and 
bloodshed. Remember that continuing clashes--regardless of the 
pretext--will not be justifiable as far as the Afghan people are 
concerned. The military and political leaders of Afghanistan 
and the people should have realized by now, after two years of 
war and bloodshed, that military means can achieve no positive 
outcome. They have no option but to resort to other means. 
  If the rival factions in Afghanistan do not resolve their 
differences amicably they will answer to the Afghan people for 
the consequences of their actions. It appears that there is 
still a chance to reconcile differences. The Afghan groups 
should readjust their demands and should display flexibility and 
a regard for the rights of other groups. They should refrain 
from intransigence and should give priority to national 
interests over group interests and thus end the Afghan crisis.

  [Excerpts] President Rabbani has expressed his readiness to 
hand over power to a council of people's representatives. He 
refused to hand in his resignation in order to avoid a power 
vacuum in the country and said: Because a council formed of 
nine jehadi leaders is not sufficient to find the solution to 
country's problems, representatives of the people will also 
participate in the council. After failing to achieve a victory 
against the Islamic state and the failure of his coup d'etat, 
Golboddin persistently insists that Rabbani was appointed to the 
presidency under the Jalalabad agreement, and thus will 
relinquish power after his term expires. In response, the 
Afghan president has said that he does not insist on staying in 
power, and whenever a council is formed of the real 
representatives of the nation, he is ready to hand over power to 
them. [passage indistinct] On the one hand Golboddin alleges 
that no government exists and therefore is not in control 
anywhere. However, the people of Afghanistan, and especially 
the people of Kabul, recently saw the broad gathering of 
governors and jehadi personalities from different provinces. It 
is not clear why Golboddin cannot see this real and complete 
power. [passage omitted] He accuses the council, which is to be 
held in a few days, and continues his crimes as in the past. In 
order to satisfy himself even for a few moments and to forget 
the bitter memories of all his weaknesses and defeats, Golboddin 
bestows upon himself the presidency of the state of Afghanistan, 
and declares, completely shamelessly, that he is ready to 
relinquish the office of premiership. It is not known to which 
premiership he is referring. It is clear that Golboddin knows 
what he means more than anyone else, and knows how laughable his 
words are. Why has a person who kneels before the dirtiest 
figure in history [Dostam] and does not refrain from 
subservience to others for power, agreed to step down from the 
premiership? The best thing for Golboddin is to learn from the 
past. Because the removal of Ahmad Shah Masud from the Ministry 
of Defense did not help him, he will not benefit from handing 
over power to the representatives of the nation. The nation's 
representatives can very well distinguish a national personality 
from a foreigner's servant and can separate good and bad. 
Confidently, the upcoming choice of a national council will be 
nothing else.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Borhanoddin Rabbani at a meeting of </F>
social organizations in Kabul on 21 June -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. [passage omitted] Brothers and sisters, the 
peace and blessing of God be upon you. First of all I express 
thanks to you all, participants in this glorious meeting held on 
the initiative of all social organizations. Undoubtedly our 
persecuted and heroic nation more urgently needs peace now than 
at any other time. We must try and join hands so that peace 
may be restored throughout our beloved country. Our nation 
should no longer suffer from difficulties and from the fighting 
with which it is confronted now. Of course, we all know who 
started this fighting and whose hands are involved in causing 
the fighting to flare up in our country. We all know what sorts 
of conspiracy are under way on the other side of our borders, 
and we all know the evil intention behind them. Despite all 
these conspiracies guided from outside, it is our religious and 
national duty and mission to work hard, day and night, to end 
the fighting and to resort to all possible means at our 
disposal. 
  As far as the Islamic State of Afghanistan is concerned, the 
state has declared its righteous strategy for the restoration of 
peace. The Islamic State, in most difficult situations, has 
given a positive reply to the message of peace from wherever it 
comes. We have been saying this all along, and we emphasize it 
again -- fighting is not the way to solve the issues. We are 
now witness to the fact that our people in the capital and 
provinces have embarked on a broad-scale endeavor to prevent the 
fighting. We have seen that a large number of governors, 
commanders, and esteemed figures have come to the capital from 
various regions of our country and have expressed readiness for 
the solution of issues. Once again our people and the people of 
the world are waiting to see what actual steps we will take for 
the solution of the present difficulties and how we will resolve 
the problems we are facing. The Islamic State recognizes that 
all issues pertaining to the selection of leaders and political 
decisionmaking on behalf of the country are the right of the 
people of Afghanistan. The people themselves must make the 
decisions. 
  The people should themselves decide. In our meetings with 
governors we emphasized the point that Afghanistan does not want 
the continuation of its leadership and political domination, and 
despite the will of the people, it has never been and will never 
be [words indistinct]. The only thing we want is the presence 
of people's representatives on the scene so that we can transfer 
political power to them, and the people can decide about their 
leadership. Further anarchism, clashes, and misery do not 
engulf our nation. 
  We asked esteemed commanders and governors to convene, as 
soon as possible, a large gathering anywhere it is feasible, and 
to invite all jehadi leaders and our tribal elders, 
personalities from inside the country and abroad, to make a 
decision in a large gathering on the future of their country. 
The opponents and those who have chosen war as the only way of 
achieving their goals should be asked not to add to the pains of 
their oppressed people. They should participate in a people's 
gathering anywhere it is to be convened. And now, at the 
invitation of the southwest zone's commanders and the initiation 
of our mojahed brother Esmail Khan, governors and a number of 
commanders of the country, and political party leaders or their 
representatives will come together in ancient Herat. 
  The Islamic State's view is that all sides to the problem 
should participate in the gathering in ancient Herat. They 
should clearly express their views and proposals at this 
gathering and then let the people themselves decide. The 
decision of our people is surely a righteous decision. We 
should welcome the resolve and decision of our people. Any 
decision which is made by representatives of our nation, who 
come from different provinces of the country or from countries 
where they live as refugees and uprooted people, all those who 
participate in this gathering should respect the collective 
opinion of our people. We will let the people decide and 
resolve the future of their country, their political leadership, 
and their resolution will be respected by everyone. 
  We asked the UN and the conference of Islamic foreign 
ministers to actively participate in solving the Afghan 
problems. After the victory of the Islamic revolution, 
Afghanistan has been [word indistinct] by world institutions. 
[Words indistinct] and strategic importance of Afghanstan 
cannot be restricted only to the pre-war period. Afghanistan 
was not an important and hot point just during the presence of 
the former Soviet Union. However, after recent changes in the 
region, Afghanistan has emerged as an important and major and 
strategic country. Surely security in Afghanistan guarantees 
security in the region and security in the world. If war and 
chaos continue in Afghanistan, the region's countries cannot 
live in tranquillity and security. There are some sides who 
want Afghanistan to live in tension. Albeit, the international 
mafia, international terrorism, and various other sides seek 
their interests in Afghanistan's chaos, conflict, and 
insecurity. They want insecurity in Afghanistan in order that 
the cells of international terrorism and the international mafia 
-- those who are engaged in activities for the expansion, 
trafficking, and production of drugs in the region and in the 
world -- may benefit from this chaos and they want to keep 
Afghanistan permanently in a state of war and chaos. The main 
problems of the great powers -- America, the European countries, 
and others -- are the prevention of drug distribution, 
production and trafficking, and the campaign against terrorism. 
God forbid, if war and chaos continue in Afghanistan, 
terrorists will use Afghanistan and the areas under their 
control for terrorist activities in the region. Therefore, 
those countries that have completely closed the Afghan file, the 
countries that think Afghanistan is no longer of importance 
following the fall of the Soviet Union and Communism, will pay a 
heavy price. God forbid that insecurity should spread to other 
countries from the Afghan borders. If that were the case, not 
only would conflicts emerge in the region, but also many 
countries would face many problems. Thus, once again we want 
great powers, international institutions, and the sides that are 
interested -- interested in peace, interested in humane values 
-- we ask them not to leave the Afghan nation alone in the 
current crisis, much of which has entered our country as 
illegitimate imported gifts from abroad. 
  Unfortunately even the humanitarian assistance to our people 
has been cut off for various incorrect reasons. We have been 
saying that there are conflicts in Afghanistan; however, there 
are not conflicts or clashes in all provinces. In over 25 
provinces of the country reconstruction work is broadly under 
way. If reconstruction started all over the country at once; if 
our youths had the opportunity to be trained and educated 
properly; and if unemployment and lack of entertainment did not 
exist in our country, surely the seditious elements, consisting 
of selfish and adventurist people, could not manage to make use 
of the situation. Obviously, unemployment is one of the major 
factor for crime and conflict in human society. Our nation 
after the war lost almost all opportunities for social work and 
economic activities. Fighting and conflicts added to these 
difficulties. 
  Those who believe in human values and human dignity should 
not forget the heroic struggle of our nation and the debt they 
owe to the people of Afghanistan. The world should not forget 
that countries are now safe from the fear of communism which 
until yesterday could not sleep at night. Before the uprising 
of our heroic and Muslim nation most of the other nations were 
spending much of their colossal budgets on repulsing the 
communism danger and repulsing the danger posed by the Soviet 
Union; they did not feel safe. The sound of alarm, even in 
major cities, used to be heard every day warning against the 
danger of the possible launching of Soviet nuclear weapons and 
cruise missiles against major capitals of the world. Those days 
have gone. This confidence, this peace, and the new chapter 
that came into being in the world are the result of the 
unreserved self-sacrifice of our nation. The world should not 
forget the self-sacrifice of our nation and the enormous 
devotion shown by our nation, which brought about the gigantic 
change. We are witness to the fact that all the ingredients of 
the dangers that once threatened the world have not yet been 
eliminated. The seeds of danger are still seeking to spring to 
life in various regions, in particular in countries that want to 
revive once again the past ideologies that formerly put the 
world in danger. Afghanistan has surely preserved its strategic 
importance and once again we call on all countries and 
international institutions to extend their assistance for the 
solution of our people's difficulties. 
  We are hoping that our persecuted nation will emerge intact 
from this problem and from this crisis. We are hoping that our 
nation by its decisive resolutions will end the existing 
conflicts and difficulties in the near future, by sending its 
representatives to the national and Islamic shuras. We do not 
want to increase the life of the government (?even by one day). 
We are trying to take part in every meeting for political talks 
and solution of the issues by understanding, and to take part in 
every session for the resolution of problems. However, this 
subject must be once again cleared up. Our decisions today 
should not be rendered in the same way, or manner, as they were 
at the time when we were homeless or soon after [words 
indistinct] when decisions and resolutions were rendered within 
a limited framework, under the name of leadership council or 
guidance council. The decision-making platform must be 
withdrawn from the leadership council and revert to a large area 
and a large gathering. The jihadi leaders must not remain for 
ever as guardians or the nation's supervisors and be the only 
ones to resolve all issues. Their jihad and their struggles are 
respected by all. The leaders however must take part in 
people's gatherings and in national shuras as individuals, as 
representatives of the people. I believe that henceforth the 
jihadi leaders should not attend every gathering as eternal 
heirs of the revolutionary uprising. They must nominate 
themselves as candidates from provinces or districts; they must 
submit themselves to the people and come to a shura from a 
district or province, not on the grounds that he was a leader of 
a formation or group. Their jihad and their leadership of 
jihadi groups is deserving of respect and acknowledgement. 
However, they must submit themselves to their people and take 
part in the political campaign and in decision- making through 
the people. Therefore, the leaders of the parties should not 
henceforth insist on resolution of issues and problems to such 
an extent as to put themselves on the opposite side of the 
people. 
  These leaders should not set themselves against the aims, 
decisions, and will of the people. We are hoping that 
henceforth the sound of machine guns and rockets will not 
trouble our elders, children, and persecuted people. We are 
hoping that our country will not be further destroyed and our 
people dragged to slaughter by the hand of Afghans. Concerning 
the state, once again I declare we are hoping that a shura, 
which will be the center of decision- making, and the highest 
forum for the people to express their will, will be convened as 
soon as possible. The state will extend every cooperation in 
this respect. We do not want to take part in the convocation of 
shura although normally the state takes a direct part in the 
convocation of shura; we will leave this task to the people; we 
will leave it to neutral sides; we leave it to the provinces; we 
leave it to the peace delegations. Whatever plan and program 
they design and implement we will support. We have asked the 
peace delegations -- and once again we call on them -- to 
accelerate the process for the restoration of peace and take 
serious action for the convocation of the shura. The state will 
only extend its cooperation and prepare the ground to facilitate 
their activities, but will not interfere in their activities. 
They can freely accomplish their work. I am hoping that the 
various parties will not continue fighting under any pretext; 
they must all join hands so that peace may be restored in our 
country. Once again I sincerely express thanks to all who are 
here at this session. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Iraq has informed the Arab League that the rulers 
of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have continued to provide facilities 
to U.S., British, and French aircraft in their violations of 
Iraqi airspace. These violations constitute a serious threat to 
Iraq's security, sovereignty, and national unity. 
  In a letter addressed the day before yesterday to the Arab 
League's secretary general, Iraq's permanent representative said 
that between 9 and 16 June, these aircraft conducted 301 hostile 
sorties and violated Iraqi airspace after taking off from bases 
in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.

  [Text] Baghdad, 23 Jun (INA) -- Iraq has reiterated its 
support for the Yemeni people's struggle against the 
secessionist and apostate forces in defense of their unity and 
the unity of their soil and state. 
  This came in a statement issued at the conclusion of the 
parliamentary talks that were held between a delegation from the 
Yemeni House of Representatives and the Iraqi National Assembly. 
  The statement stresses the Iraqi people's denunciation of 
the 
interference of some suspect regional and foreign parties to 
prolong the fighting and impose the status quo of disunity in 
order to dismember the Republic of Yemen and jeopardize the 
unity of its people. 
  The two sides condemned the continued blockade imposed on 
the 
people of Iraq. They called for an immediate end to the 
blockade since Iraq has implemented all its obligations toward 
the unfair UN Security Council resolutions issued against it. 
  The Yemeni House of Representatives delegation visiting 
Iraq, 
led by Muhammad 'Abdallah al-Kibsi, held meetings with officials 
and heads of unions and professional and popular organizations 
to explain the latest developments in the situation in Yemen and 
the efforts to resolve the crisis in a manner that conforms with 
constitutional legitimacy, which is being defended by the 
fraternal Yemeni people.

  [Text] Baghdad, June 23, INA -- Yugoslav economy minister 
[Milorad Unkovic], who is on a several-day visit to the country 
said his government is looking forward to resume good ties with 
Iraq and its leadership, especially in economic fields. 
  In press statements published here, the minister hailed 
Iraqis steadfastness despite the tragic consequences resulting 
from the continuation of the UN-imposed blockade on Iraq. 
  The imposition of blockade has greatly affected the 
Iraqi-Yugoslav trade relations, the economy minister pointed out. 
  Iraq and Yugoslavia were used to exchange goods, equipment, 
and other industrial supplies. Moreover about half of the 
latter total needs of oil was used to be imported from Iraq, the 
visiting minister added. 
  Furthermore, many Yugoslav companies had implemented 
billion-dollars worth strategic projects in various parts of 
Iraq just before the U.S.-led aggression and the imposition of 
the sanctions. 
  According to the Yugoslav minister, who is also his 
country's 
representative to the meetings of the Iraqi-Yugoslav joint 
economic committee, their presence in Baghdad will help enhance 
and restore economic and scientific cooperation. 
  He referred to the current political situation in 
Yugoslavia, 
stressing that relations between countries of the world must be 
based on firm and equal grounds. 
  The Yugoslav minister added that the United States was the 
party responsible for the collapse of Yugoslavia and the 
eruption of civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Nevertheless, 
the Yugoslav government and people are still fighting and 
struggling to get independence, he concluded. 
  On the other hand, minister of planning, Samal Majid Faraj, 
on Sunday [19 June] met with the Yugoslav economy minister and 
the accompanying delegation. During the meeting, the two 
ministers discussed means of boosting bilateral relations.

<F P=106> [Report by Zuhayr Qusaybati: "Barzani Has Resumed </F>
Negotiations With Baghdad"] 
  [Excerpts] London -- AL-HAYAH has learned from informed 
Iraqi Kurdish sources that Mas'ud Barzani, leader of the 
Kurdistan Democratic Party [KDP], has resumed negotiations with 
Baghdad. 
  The sources said that the party sent one of Barzani's senior 
aides to Baghdad, where he held talks 11 and 12 June. They 
confirmed that a KDP delegation including KDP Central Committee 
Member Yunis Ruzbayani and 'Izzat Sulayman Bik, a prominent 
party figure, visited Baghdad 10 June and met with President 
Saddam Husayn's son Qusayy. The results of the talks are not 
known. 
  The sources said that the three figures [as published] went 
to the Iraqi capital via the Fa'idah point on the dividing lines 
between the areas under the Iraqi Army's control and the areas 
under the control of the Kurdistan Front [KF]. They added that 
Falak al-Din Kaka'i, a prominent member of Barzani's party, 
confirmed in an interview broadcast by the Voice of America's 
Kurdish service Sunday night that the Turkish Government had 
asked the party seven months earlier to start a dialogue with 
the Iraqi Government. [passage omitted] 
  The same sources added that the KDP "perhaps interpreted the 
Turkish request as being a reflection of the Western and 
particulary the U.S. position." They did not rule out the 
possibility that the negotiations between Barzani and Baghdad 
might cause "more tension between the Kurdish leaders and, 
generally, in the ranks of the Iraqi opposition." [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Baghdad, June 23, INA -- AL-THAWRAH newspaper of 
Baghdad said the natural state that realizes peace and security 
to Iraqi Kurds is the state that rejects concepts of the 
traitors and agents and commits to Iraq's integrity. 
  A paper article here today said that events taking place in 
north Iraq scoff at the reported cessation of fighting between 
the cliques of Mas'ud Barzani and Jalal Talabani. The paper 
referred to the ongoing operations of kidnapping, physical 
liquidation and the state of panic and fear that had motivated 
Kurdish families to evict their homes and villages. 
  The paper said the tragedy of Kurds in the north where 
cliques of Barzani and Talabani were fighting each other, would 
continue in their presence, bringing further daily bitter 
tortures and catastrophes.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Iraqi Turkoman Party Refuses To Be </F>
Dragged Into Conflicts in Northern Iraq"] 
  [Text] London, AL-HAYAH -- The Iraqi Turkoman National 
Party has called for the withdrawal of the armed militias from 
residential areas in northern Iraq and emphasized the need for 
"a return to the language of dialogue and rejection of the 
language of arms," and it refused to be dragged into the 
conflicts. 
  A statement sent by the party to AL-HAYAH said that attempts 
have been made to attack the party's offices and buildings, 
including "the cowardly attempt which targeted the Society in 
Aid of the Poor, which is attached to the Turkoman Party, 
committed by people whose identity and party affiliation were 
known." It mentioned the killing of Rushdi Tahsin, member of 
the party's Irbil Committee and member of the Administrative 
Committee of the Turkoman Human Rights Organization, and party 
member Ahmad Junbaz and his son Mustafa. It requested that the 
implications of the crime be exposed. 
  It maintained that "the collapse of authority and 
administration in the region" as a result of the fighting 
between the parties of Jalal Talabani and Mas'ud Barzani -- the 
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the Kurdistan Democratic Party 
-- had "resulted in anarchy and lawlessness endangering the 
lives of the population." It added that tension persisted in 
the areas under the control of the two parties and that "the 
Turkomans, led by the Turkoman National Party, intend to pursue 
a peaceful democratic course in the struggle for the achievement 
of freedom and democracy in Iraq. All the cheap ways of trying 
to divert them from these principles will fail.... The 
Turkomans will remain outside the conflicts and disputes despite 
all the attempts and plans to involve them."

Properties. Speaking to al AL-QADISIYAH, Authority Acting 
Director General Tariq 'Aziz Rashid Nasir said: The 
establishment of the Authority has come in implementation of 
Revolution Command Council Decision No. 176, according to which 
the Authority's Law No. 18 of 1993 was issued. The Authority 
will be managed by a council consisting of the minister of Awqaf 
as chairman, three men of religion, the director general of the 
Authority, and four experts in the fields of economic, 
financial, administrative, legal, engineering, and agricultural 
affairs. The council shall exercise all powers that relate to 
the management and investment of awqaf properties in accordance 
with the provisions of Islamic law, with the exception of those 
awqaf properties that are under private management. 
  The director general explained: The Authority will invest 
these properties in a manner that guarantees their development 
and achieves economic viability while observing the conditions 
set by the trustees and disposing of religious trusts in the 
correct Islamic manner. The Authority's budget will be 
independent of the state's general budget and will be 
self-financed. The Authority will fix its own annual revenues 
and expenditures in accordance with the provisions of Islamic 
law. The Authority's budget will consist of revenues from 
religious trusts, rents, grants, and donations in accordance 
with the law. 
  The acting director general pointed out that the Authority 
intends to open up branches in the governorates in light of the 
size of religious trusts in each governorate.

  [Text] The number of patients who called at popular medical 
clinics in 1993 complaining of different diseases was more than 
8 million, while the number of patients who called at these 
clinics in 1992 was not more than 6 million. 
  Dr. 'Imad Jassam [not further identified] has said the 
increase in the number of patients is due to malnutrition 
suffered by children, mothers, and old people and to the 
scarcity of essential drugs for them. He pointed out that the 
number of patients suffering from chronic diseases has exceeded 
328,000. 
  Dr. Jassam added that popular clinics in all governorates 
employ a total of 88 specialist doctors, 540 general 
practitioners, 92 dentists, and more than 630 members of the 
health care and nursing professions.

transliterated]. A Health Ministry source said that this 
measure was taken due to the unavailability of Angipist due to 
the unfair embargo on medicines for the Iraqi people and the UN 
Sanctions Commission's disapproval of Iraq's request to obtain 
this medicine from the British Force Whitcome Company [name as 
transliterated], which supplies Iraq with this medicine.

<F P=106> [Article by 'Abd-al-Wahid Harjan] </F>
  [Excerpt] The Iraqi General Railways Establishment has 
begun transporting wheat and barley crops from the current 
agricultural season from production areas to storage areas in 
the various governorates. Announcing this, Establishment 
Director General Sabri Kati' 'Abd said: Immediately upon 
receiving the transportation plan from the Ministry of Trade, 
Iraqi railway teams began transporting the two crops from 
assembly areas in al-Diwaniyah to silos in the governorate of 
al-Basrah, and from assembly areas in al-Sharqat, al- Wa'iliyah, 
and Rabi'ah in the governorate of Ninawa to their storage areas 
in al-Taji, al-Dawrah, Khan Dari, al-Hillah, al-Samawah, and 
al-Nasiriyah. This is in addition to transporting imported 
foodstuffs from the Port of Umm Qasr to the stores of the 
Ministry of Trade. The Iraqi Railway Establishment is also 
participating in the national campaign of moving harvesters from 
one governorate to another to ensure the success of the major 
harvest campaign. [passage omitted]

Department 
of Agriculture is redoubling its efforts to complete the wheat

  [Text] A source at the Tunisian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, answering a question about the latest developments of 
the situation in Rwanda and especially the intention of some 
non-African countries to send forces to that country, said that 
Tunisia, which chairs the Organization of African Unity, OAU, 
affirms that the Rwandan issue should be tackled according to 
Security Council resolution 918 dated 17 March 1994 and within 
the framework of the 30th OAU summit decision on the need to 
base every move on the following principles: 
  -- coordinating with the OAU regarding the sending of any 
forces to Rwanda in support of the central organ of conflict 
prevention, management, and settlement mechanism. 
  -- only African forces and no other should be sent to Rwanda 
as stated by the above mentioned Security Council resolution. 
  -- securing the consent of the conflicting parties before 
taking the initiative of sending troops. 
  -- enlisting the material and logistic support of other 
countries wishing to contribute to the establishment of peace 
and stability in that African country. 
  The same source added that Tunisia, as chairman of the OAU, 
sees that it is preferable to support this framework agreed on 
by the African countries and by the Security Council and 
considers that any other initiative outside this framework would 
further complicate the situation and would hinder the 
reconciliation and peace efforts in that sisterly African 
country.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gabonese President Omar Bongo by Stephen </F>
Smith in Tunis; date not given: "We Need a Peacekeeping Force" 
-- first paragraph is LIBERATION introduction] 
  [Text] Together with General Eyadema (Togo) and Marshal 
Mobutu (Zaire), the Gabonese president is one of Africa's "elder 
statesmen." In his opinion, the Rwandan agreement is a "botched 
job." Explanations. 
  [Smith] Everyone is expressing satisfaction with the 
cease-fire proclaimed in Rwanda. Is it not a success for Africa? 
  [Bongo] Frankly, I say no. Because the resolution which has 
been adopted is void of meaning. It does not say when the 
cease-fire will come into effect, nor when the extra Blue 
Helmets will arrive in Kigali. Nor does it specify when 
political negotiations will begin and, finally, it says nothing 
concrete about picking up the Arusha accords again, signed by 
the late President Habyarimana and the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic 
Front] rebels. In fact, it contains nothing more than 
recommendations. It is not enough. Africa should have stated, 
very explicitly, what it was demanding and should have given 
itself the resources to impose this on the warring parties. 
  [Smith] So you did not vote for the resolution? 
  [Bongo] No, it was adopted without my vote and in my 
absence. 
With the support of other heads of state, I then made a 
counterproposal. But apparently it was to late. 
  [Smith] A year ago, at the previous African summit, a 
"mechanism to prevent, manage, and settle regional conflicts" 
was set up. What has become of it? 
  [Bongo] In practice, alas, this settlement instrument does 
not intervene. Perhaps if our new acting chairman (Tunisian 
President Ben Ali) goes at it with his customary determination, 
it will become operational. But if not, it will be yet 
something else which will not work. 
  [Smith] Is there not a problem of the changing of the guard 
in French-speaking Africa? Whenever there is a serious crisis, 
there are only the old hands, like you, General Eyadema, or 
Marshal Mobutu, who are present? What about the "La Baule 
generation" of new African leaders? 
  [Bongo] They are only just coming on board. They have to 
learn. One cannot intervene, here or there, without knowing 
how. Give them time. I am sure that, in two or three years' 
time, they will know. Then it is going to be very tough for... 
  [Smith] ...The West? 
  [Bongo] ...For our interlocutors. There is not just the 
West. 
  [Smith] South Africa, the big hope, on the one hand, and 
Rwanda, the drama, on the other. Between these two poles, where 
is Africa going? 
  [Bongo] I believe that Africa will move toward the South 
African model. Because what we have there -- from Mandela's 
freeing by De Klerk to the election of a former prisoner as 
president -- is a democratic lesson which many of us ought to 
have applied a long time ago, in particular in the way we treat 
our opposition. In Rwanda, the logic of coup d'etats still 
reigns. It is always "Get out of there, so I take your 
place..." President Habyarimana did not die in an accident. He 
was assassinated. But if the cease-fire holds, we must deploy a 
peacekeeping force, evacuate the children, and begin 
negotiations for an interim government, until elections can be 
held.

  The head of goverment is expected in Paris later today. Our 
colleague Noreddine Bouziane has sent us the following report 
from Paris before the start of the visit: 
  [Bouziane] Head of Government Mokdad Sifi is expected in 
Paris this afternoon. He will be coming from Brussels where he 
has secured, according to the Belgian prime minister, an 
economic aid package from Belgium. 
  Mokdad Sifi will be meeting at the Elysee Palace soon after 
his arrival with French President Mitterrand. It is expected 
that their talks will focus on the situation in Algeria and the 
future of the dialogue between the authorities and the 
opposition. 
  Sources close to the Elysee Palace have told us that 
President Mitterrand will be reiterating to the head of the 
Algerian Government the need to launch a dialogue with all 
political forces in the country because France, according to the 
same sources, believes that keeping the status quo will not 
bring closer any opportunities to resolve the Algerian crisis.

today, where he has met French President Francois Mitterrand and 
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. He has made a statement to the 
international media. Rachida Hamadi reports from Brussels [as 
heard]: 
  At this very moment [as heard], immediately after his 
arrival 
from Belgium to France, the head of government, Mokdad Sifi, is 
meeting French President Francois Mitterrand. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent addressing 
Sifi] Prime Minister, have you found a favorable response from 
the French side regarding Algeria's demands or needs for 
assistance? 
  [Sifi] I have not come here to ask for anything. I have come 
to hold talks with French and European officials within the 
framework of cooperation in all spheres -- political and 
economic spheres. My meeting with President Mitterrand allows 
me to say that he supports the Algerian Government's and head of 
state's endeavors. [end recording] 
  After his meeting with President Mitterrand, the prime 
minister went to French government headquarters, where he had a 
meeting with French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. The 
meeting lasted about an hour.

  [Text] Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi expressed his complete 
satisfaction with the talks which he held yesterday evening in 
Paris with his French counterpart Edouard Balladur. Sifi said 
that France's view of Algeria takes into account the closeness 
of existing Algerian-French and Algerian-European cooperation 
and the situation in the Euro-Maghreban region. He explained 
that cooperation, whether between Algeria and France or Algeria 
and Europe, serves the interest of both sides. 
  In the economic field, Mokdad Sifi indicated that the 
results 
of his visits to France could be embodied in comprehensive 
cooperation. In this regard, he said that the renewal of French 
loans to Algeria, which amount to about six billion francs will 
serve the interest of Algeria just as it will serve the interest 
of French investors. 
  On the other hand, Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi, who was 
received immediately after his arrival in France by President 
Francois Mitterrand, announced that the latter had stressed 
continuing French and European support [for Algeria] in the 
political and economic fields. 
  Regarding his talks in Brussels, Mokdad Sifi told the press 
before leaving Brussels for Paris that he has sensed the desire 
among the European partners to bolster cooperation with Algeria 
and provide their contribution so that Algeria can get out of 
the crisis as soon as possible. 
  What can be deduced from this first foreign visit of Mokdad 
Sifi in his capacity as prime minister is that Europe has 
confirmed its readiness to release the loan of 200 million ECUs. 
In principle this will take place next September or before the 
end of December. 
  The satisfactory results also include the need to set up a 
mechanism for swift negotiations with the aim of concluding a 
new partnership agreement to take the place of the 1976 
agreement. This will be an agreement aimed at establishing a 
free trade area similar to what is currently under negotiation 
with Morocco and Tunisia.

  [Excerpts] State President Liamine Zeroual received today 
at his office Salim Salih Muhammad, special envoy of 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid. The meeting was attended by Mihoub Mihoubi, adviser in 
charge of diplomatic affairs and the president's official 
spokesman. Upon leaving the state president's office the Yemeni 
envoy made the following statement: 
  [Begin Salim Salih Muhammad recording] We explained to his 
excellency the brother president the latest developments in the 
situation in Yemen and the current war, which was started by 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih on 27 April, when he declared war 
on the southern regions. Eight weeks have passed but fierce 
fighting is still going on causing huge human and material 
losses. [passage omitted] 
  We are calling on the Arab brothers, and Algeria in 
particular given its place in our hearts as well as its 
experience, to play a role and help us to secure an immediate 
cease-fire so as to stop the bloodshed and save those Yemenis 
who are still alive and the installations which are still 
standing. We are also urging them to recognize the situation 
before unification which has failed in its four years to achieve 
the amalgamation of two systems, two armies, two state 
institutions, two currencies, etc. We want a return to the 
situation before 22 May 1990. This is our stand. And we are 
now defending our right and the right of our children to life 
and to the protection of our property which is being destroyed 
day in and day out. [passage omitted] 
  We are, therefore, urging all our brothers in the Arab 
Maghreb or in the Arab Mashriq to stop this war through the 
implementation of the UN Security Council resolution and resolve 
this problem wisely through dialogue and dialogue alone. [end 
recording]

  [Text] State President Liamine Zeroual received at his 
office at the presidency this morning Abdelkader Bensalah, 
chairman of the Transitional National Council [TNC], and his six 
deputies. The meeting was attended by Mohamed Betchine, 
minister adviser to the state president, and Youcef Khatib, 
adviser to the state president. 
  During a brief address at the meeting, the state president 
dwelt upon the importance of the TNC as an institution where all 
affiliations and viewpoints can meet and as a platform for 
democratic debate. He pointed out the great tasks facing the TNC 
which should ensure that the principles of the National Concord 
[document] are respected. 
  The head of state added that the members of the TNC bureau 
should try and enhance the government's agenda. It should also, 
given the fact that it is representative of all society's 
strata, supervise, guarantee, and follow up the concerns of all 
classes of the society. We will be encouraging you to do so, the 
head of state affirmed. 
  Concerning the absence of some parties from the TNC, the 
head 
of state pointed out that this should not mean that they are 
excluded from the management of the country's affairs. The 
latter is facing a very difficult period in its history and 
therefore it needs all its sincere sons to rebuild Algeria upon 
sound bases which will meet the country's higher interest.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi by Agnes Gorissen </F>
and Philippe Regnier; place and date not given: "On Political 
and Economic Challenges Facing Algerian Government"] 
  [Text] [LE SOIR] In February, Algeria entered the 
transitional period intended to permit, in three years time, a 
return to the electoral process. But this transition is at 
present handicapped by two factors: One is the refusal of 
several parties (the National Liberation Front, the Socialist 
Forces Front, the Rally for Culture and Democracy) to 
participate in the transitional institutions, the other is the 
Islamist phenomenon. 
  [Sifi] The dialogue already brings together political 
parties, including moderate islamist parties, key figures, and 
representatives of social, trade union or cultural groups which 
are clearly representative. We will begin with all these 
parties and keep the door open; the seats reserved for the other 
parties (22 seats out of the 200 in the National Transitional 
Council -- editor's note) remain available, they can join us at 
any stage. The process of dialogue, with those who respect the 
Constitution and laws and who reject terrorism, is not easy, and 
it takes time. 
  [LE SOIR] Time, while the violence by armed Islamic groups 
continues, particularly against civilians: doctors, 
journalists, professors. Why these targets and not just 
government representatives? 
  [Sifi] You have to try and read these terrorist acts. They 
are seeking to upset the country's social and economic life, and 
they no doubt believed that through these acts they could act 
upon the population, bring them to the brink, and cause them to 
create even greater problems. It has not achieved this result, 
quite the contrary. 
  [LE SOIR] Is there any possibility of solving the present 
crisis without entering into dialogue with the Islamic fringe? 
  [Sifi] Certainly. What counts most in Algeria is the 
population. If it finds a response to its aspirations, housing, 
employment, I fail to see why this will not work. 
  [LE SOIR] If the Islamists agreed to dialogue, what 
concessions are the authorities prepared to make? 
  [Sifi] The authorities have no concessions to make. Anyone 
who talks of power-sharing is going against democracy. It is up 
to the population to decide who it is going to entrust with 
power. In any event our government is a transitional one, it is 
not intended to stay in place. 
  [LE SOIR] But to move away from a security policy and toward 
a more social policy, you must succeed in "managing" the problem 
of the "hard-line" Islamists and the armed groups. 
  [Sifi] I do not know where these people are. There are armed 
gangs who recruit young people with nothing else to do, but the 
rest of the population rejects such a situation. We must now 
stop this violence, the government must reinforce the 
antiterrorist measures. And all democratic states must ensure 
that their country does not become a rear or transit base for 
terrorists. 
  [LE SOIR] In this respect, what are your relations with 
Germany and the United States, which have allowed in Rabah Kebir 
and Anwar Haddam respectively? 
  [Sifi] A country has sovereign rights at home, but there are 
always limits that it must respect. Steps are taken to ask our 
partners to be vigilant, because things can happen without their 
knowledge. And this applies even more so when things are known. 
  [LE SOIR] The WASHINGTON POST recently reported on direct 
contacts between the CIA and the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front], 
which apparently gave assurances to the United States in return 
for a certain support. 
  [Sifi] I have not received any precise information on the 
official positions except for that from the U.S. President who 
denounced terrorism. But it seems that Bill Clinton expressed 
the desire to see a broader government base in Algeria, which is 
ultimately what everyone wants. It is an approval of the 
Algerian approach. There had been very low level contacts with 
the people from the FIS. For information purposes perhaps. 
  [LE SOIR] In certain circles, in Algeria and abroad, the 
authorities are also given some "bad marks," for human rights in 
particular: excessive repression, death squads. 
  [Sifi] That is a tactic to destabilize the country. The 
security services have received firm instructions not to fall 
into the trap of repression, even at the risk of delaying their 
operations or of losing men. And every measure has been taken 
to severely punish any excesses. 
  [LE SOIR] Caught in a cycle of terrorism-repression, Algeria 
sometimes gives the impression of economic inertia. What are 
your priorities? 
  [Sifi] Our priorities lie in four areas. First of all, 
accommodation: We must make it possible to build as much 
housing as possible, in the framework of the development of a 
market economy. Because to date, housing programs along with all 
our other activities, have been in the hands of a corrupt 
administration. You have to wait from eight to 10 years for a 
home! We need 1.2 million houses if each one is occupied by 
seven people, which is much higher than the standards approved 
by the World Health Organization. 
  [LE SOIR] And other priorities? 
  [Sifi] The development of small- and medium-sized companies 
and agriculture, an area in which we are lagging far behind. We 
depend on the outside world: We import foodstuffs worth $2 
billion every year despite our considerable resources. Then 
there are hydrocarbons, in which we are currently investing. 
They will allow us to double our gas exports by 1998 or 1999 
and to maintain our present level of oil production. 
  [LE SOIR] Will that undermine Islamism? 
  [Sifi] Yes. All these investments meet the needs of the 
population, with improved management of the health, education, 
and water distribution sectors. Improvements in these areas 
will allow us to relieve the burden so far borne by the 
population. If it did not suffer at the hands of terrorism, it 
would be from crime, delinquency, or drugs. Terrorism has the 
same roots as the other evils. 
  [LE SOIR] You are making your first visit to Brussels and 
Paris since your election. What are you going to discuss with 
the European authorities? 
  [Sifi] We are going to see how we can speed up the 
adaptation 
of the accord which has bound us to the European Union since 
1976. We hope the Union will delegate experts to start 
discussions within "reasonable" deadlines. This adaptation must 
take into account political and economic change in Algeria. 
  [LE SOIR] And on the subject of the debt? 
  [Sifi] After the accord concluded at the Club de Paris to 
reschedule the debt, we have until 31 December to conclude 
bilateral agreements with Belgium and 16 other countries.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Isam 'Abd-al-Jawad] </F>
  [Text] Divisions that almost led to an armed clash broke 
out within the extremist groups' ranks in al-Minya last week. 
The reason was the declaration by over 40 extremists to the 
security authorities that they have repented and renounced 
extremist thought. Thus the number of repenters in al-Minya has 
exceeded 70, most of whom represent the basic figures of the 
extremist groups in al-Minya's cities, especially in (al-'Adwah) 
District, where the majority of extremist leaders declared their 
repentance. This is regarded as the first rift of its kind 
among the extremists in al-Minya. 
  Reactions by leaders of the extremist groups over the last 
week have varied. A number of extremists announced in their 
mosques in al-Minya Governorate their intention to take revenge 
against the repenters, whom they described as "hypocrites and 
cowards," and demanded that they be banned from entering the 
mosques they control. The extremist leaders urged a firm stand 
against the repenters. Other extremists asked for there to be no 
battle with the repenters or clashes with them because this 
would lead to further intervention by the security agencies. 
  For their part, the repenters asked the governorate's 
officials and security agencies to back them and to protect them 
against the terrorists' threats. 
  An informed source stated that the repenters continue to 
flock to the security authorities as a result of the firm, 
decisive stand on extremism and terrorism and because of the 
people's awareness in al-Minya Governorate, which differs from 
other governorates in Upper Egypt. He said last week saw the 
arrest of 30 extremists and outlaws in the largest ever campaign 
of arrests in al-Minya Governorate, designed to avert more 
incidents. 
  ROSE AL-YUSUF has learned that the Asyut security agencies' 
Operation "Spencer" against the northern area--which includes 
the cities of al-Badari, Sidfa, and Abu Tij--managed to 
exterminate the terrorist elements in that area in cooperation 
with the Suhaj security agencies. In the last few days the 
authorities have been able to arrest 80 extremists and to foil a 
plot to carry out terrorist attacks in the area.

Rights Organization [EHRO], has begun a hunger strike at the 
association's headquarters in Cairo. He said he would continue 
the hunger strike until Prosecutor General Raja' al-'Arabi 
publicizes the findings of investigations into the death of 
Lawyer 'Abd-al- Harith Madani and releases the detained lawyers. 
  The Lawyers Association Council held a meeting in its 
general 
headquarters yesterday to discuss developments in the case. 
'Abd- al-'Aziz Muhammad, a 58-year-old diabetic, announced the 
beginning of his strike and sit-in and said that he would give a 
press conference at the headquarters tomorrow, Monday [20 June]. 
The meeting was attended by heads of the association's 
sub-branches. 
  Sayyid Khalaf, secretary general of the Cairo branch of the 
association, is expected to join the hunger strike on Monday. 
The association's council members will follow suit. 
  Yesterday EHRO appealed to all human rights organizations to 
intervene with the Egyptian authorities to release two of its 
lawyers. The appeal affirmed that the two lawyers were arrested 
in court as they were performing their duty of being present at 
the interrogation of lawyers arrested during riots outside the 
association. The two lawyers--Jamal 'Abd-al-'Aziz and Sayyid 
Fathi--work at the EHRO's Field Unit.

  [Text] Beirut, 22 Jun (MENA)--The Lebanese newspaper 
AL-SAFIR reports that the Egyptian Government has warned Israel 
through diplomatic channels against escalating the military 
situation in southern Lebanon and wrecking the entire peace 
process. The paper cites diplomatic sources as saying that the 
Egyptian warning to Israel came in the light of diplomatic 
information that the Israeli army is preparing to launch a 
military operation against Lebanon soon. 
  AL-SAFIR says that the Lebanese Government has received 
information that Israel is preparing for a military operation 
against Lebanon. The paper says that the Israeli General Staff 
is planning a military operation supervised by Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, who ordered that such an operation be 
quick and painful. 
  Lebanese Foreign Ministry sources say that Lebanese 
diplomatic circles are conducting intensive contacts with Arab 
and international quarters to contain the escalation of Israeli 
attacks against Lebanon. 
  The past few days have witnessed serious escalation in 
Israeli air and ground attacks against Hizballah positions in 
southern Lebanon and the western al-Biqa' as well as continuous 
Israeli shelling of al-Nabatiyah and Iqlim al-Tuffah areas. 
These attacks left a number of civilians dead or wounded, 
destroyed many houses, and set crop fields on fire.

  [Text] According to reports from the south this morning, 
al-Nabatiyah, particularly the (Nadi al-Shaqif) area, came under 
an Israeli artillery barrage, killing a soldier and injuring 
another. 
  The Israeli enemy escalated its acts of aggression 
yesterday. 
Enemy artillery bombarded several areas in the south, creating 
severe tension in these areas amid reports from the occupied 
border strip on Israeli military movements inside the strip. 
According to security sources, Israeli enemy forces and agent 
militia [South Lebanese Army] [SLA] increased their military 
ground movements in the occupied strip and launched large raking 
operations in the woods and beside the roads. These sources 
noted that the enemy set up barriers beyond curves in the roads, 
and Israeli and SLA soldiers searched cars and interrogated 
passengers. In addition, the Israeli forces set up a new 
center east of Tallusah, which the resistance men attacked with 
rockets. Other enemy movements were spotted in the Hula area. 
  The UN Interim Forces in Lebanon [UNIFIL] reports confirmed 
that the heavy Israeli bombardment continued yesterday and 
covered the western, central, and eastern sectors, noting that 
the UNIFIL areas of operation also came under the barrage, 
including the Fijian contingent area of operations in 
al-Mansuri, the Nepalese area in Rshaf, the Irish and Ghanaian 
area in Majdal Silm, and the Finnish area in Wadi al-Siryan. 
These acts of aggression were accompanied by hostile 
overflights over various sectors of the south. Israeli 
helicopters flew over the western sector of Tyre up to the 
international border from midnight until early this morning. 
The resistance retaliated by firing a number of missiles at the 
border strip.

  [Text] Beirut, 22 Jun (MENA) -- Informed Lebanese sources 
said today that the U.S. authorities have informed the Lebanese 
Government of their readiness to extradite a number of Lebanese 
people wanted in Lebanon on charges of participating in the 
Sayyidat al-Najah Church explosion and the assassination of Dany 
Sham'un, leader of the National Liberal Party, and his family. 
The sources said that the U.S. authorities asked the Lebanese 
Government to submit a complete file on the two crimes and the 
persons being sought. Among the fugitives who fled to the 
United States is Ghassan Tuma, head of the security apparatus of 
the dissolved Lebanese Forces Party. 
  Lebanon has sent requests to Interpol to arrest 15 people 
indicted in connection with the church explosion and the 
assassination of Sham'un and his family. However, Lebanese 
judicial sources have not yet received any information that the 
fugitives have been arrested so they can be brought back to 
Lebanon for trial before the State Security Court. 
  The sources said that the bills of indictment in the two 
crimes will be referred to the Judicial Council within the next 
two days so that a date can be set for beginning the trial of 
the accused, led by Samir Ja'ja', former leader of the dissolve 
Lebanese Forces Party.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Uthman Mirghani: "Al-Mahdi Stresses His </F>
Commitment to `Civil Jihad'"] 
  [Excerpts] London -- The Sudanese opposition Ummah Party 
yesterday condemned the arrest by security authorities of its 
leader, former Prime Minister al-Sadiq al-Mahdi. The party 
described the accusations leveled at him -- namely that he led a 
scheme to carry out bombings and assassinations -- as "a 
fabricated theatrical ploy within the framework of the continued 
harassment of him." 
  The Ummah Party yesterday distributed a statement which it 
said was prepared by al-Mahdi before his arrest, concerning the 
arrest by security authorities of two Ummah Party leaders, 
namely Professor Hammad Baqadi and 'Abd-al-Rahman Farah. 
  In his statement al-Mahdi said that the basic principle on 
the basis of which he operates is "civil jihad, and working to 
achieve democracy in Sudan without bloodshed or foreign 
intervention." [passage omitted] 
  Al-Sadiq al-Mahdi said in the statement distributed by the 
Ummah Party yesterday that "security services have on several 
occasions tried to fabricate accusations against us: They 
accused us once of working with Libya to achieve certain aims 
through violence. That was in 1989. Then they leveled 
accusations at us on more than three occasions: They twice 
accused us of planning coup attempts, and once they dragged our 
name into the bombings case heard recently. They also 
fabricated numerous accusations against us with regard to cases 
involving violence and bloodshed. These accusations are nothing 
but fabrications." 
  Al-Mahdi added: "This is why I say once again that the 
present accusations leveled at some well-known men from our 
group are nothing but an attempt to distort our reputation and 
continue the usual fabrications in a bid to create sensational 
situations and divert attention from the political and economic 
failures." 
  Concluding, he said: "Once again I say that we are pursuing 
one line, that is civil jihad, to achieve the homeland's aims. 
And even if we -- for one reason or another -- decide to pursue 
another line, it would not be in such a naive manner or in the 
recklessness clear in the background of the accusations."

  [Excerpts] While reports say that members of the disbanded 
Ummah party abroad broke off from the so-called Patriotic 
Alliance because of serious differences with the scattered 
remnants of the opposition, security organs inside the country 
exposed the threads of a conspiracy which was being hatched out 
by some members of this disbanded party under the leadership of 
al-Sadiq al-Mahdi. Security sources say they had been 
monitoring this group for some time and made arrests after 
fixing the zero hour. Following confessions by members of the 
group, the security sources said the group had planned to 
assassinate well-known personalities and to blow up some vital 
installations. [passage omitted]. 
  But there are other sides to this issue, namely the 
intelligence of foreign states, which wish to see the day when 
Sudan drowns in a sea of blood. Another aspect is the scattered 
remnants of the opposition abroad which are linked to these 
foreign intelligence organs and which are competing to carry out 
activities inside the country, whatever these may be, in order 
to justify obtaining funds from the financing quarters. 
  According to the confessions of those caught, that is 
Brigadier Retired 'Abd-al-Rahman Farah, former security adviser, 
Hamad 'Umar Baqadi, member of the dissolved Ummah Party's 
Political Bureau and one called Seyf al-Din Sa'id, in charge of 
security and information in the dissolved party, their contacts 
with foreign quarters in Khartoum have not ended. Whether they 
are instigating these quarters to finance sabotage operations or 
whether those quarters are the instigators is immaterial. 
Ultimately the result is the same, namely to drown the country 
in a sea of blood and to sabotage vital installations. In any 
case, the only ones to benefit are those foreign quarters.

<F P=106> [Report by Mahmud Bakri: "Israelis and Sudanese Rebels Meet </F>
Secretly on Borders with Ethiopia"] 
  [Text] AL-SHA'B has learned that a secret meeting was held 
recently at a location close to the Sudanese-Ethiopian borders 
between an Israeli delegation and a delegation of southern 
Sudanese rebels. 
  Available information indicates that the Israeli delegation, 
led by their foreign ministry's director general, discussed with 
the rebels a general plan of action in European countries and 
the United States designed to initiate exchanges between the 
rebels and members of the Sudanese opposition abroad focusing on 
ways of undermining the ruling regime in Sudan. You will recall 
that the rebels recently suffered a succession of defeats at the 
hands of the Sudanese Army. 
  During the meeting, the Israeli Foreign Ministry's secretary 
general expressed Israel's willingness to give political and 
military assistance to the rebels. The two parties made 
arrangements for a delegation of the southern Sudanese rebels to 
visit Israel. 
  The Israeli move comes against a backdrop of 
Egyptian-Sudanese differences. According to available 
information, Israel is enticing the southerners to take 
advantage of these differences by declaring the secession of the 
southern Sudan. Israel has promised to give major assistance to 
the rebels in their struggle against the Sudanese Army.

<F P=106> [Report from Washington by correspondent Murid Hammad -- </F>
recorded; italicized passages in English] 
  [Text] His Majesty King Husayn began the third and final 
day of a state visit to the United States by meeting with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton. The U.S. President was on hand to 
welcome his majesty on his arrival at the White House. 
  The U.S. President emphasized his country's support for 
Jordan. 
  [Begin recording] [Hammad] [words indistinct] 
Jordan's [word indistinct] peace in the Middle East, and 
[word indistinct] people back home [words indistinct] in this 
regard, and what are (?the words) you would have for the 
Jordanian people? 
  [Clinton] The United States is prepared to do a lot to 
try to make peace a success, both from the security point of 
view and from an economic point of view. My message to the 
Jordanian people is that they should support the work the king 
is doing now. He is clearly working to protect the long-term 
interests of the people of Jordan and is being very careful and 
forthright and still courageous in this peace process. And that 
the United States will support the friends of peace not just in 
the aftermath of the peace agreement, if one can be achieved, 
but over the very long run. We believe that our interests are 
very much bound up with the success of Jordan and Israel and 
Syria and Lebanon and all the other parties in the Middle East. 
We think it's a very important part of our future. And we 
intend to be there in a very strong way. 
  [Hammad] Does that include also helping Jordan 
(?economically?) 
  [Clinton] Absolutely. [end recording] 
  The Jordanian and American sides began an expanded session 
attended on the Jordanian side by the prime minister; the Royal 
Court chief; his majesty's political adviser; Prince Talal Bin- 
Muhammad, his majesty the king's military secretary; and the 
Jordanian ambassador in Washington. There will be a closed 
session between his majesty the king and the U.S. President and 
a special luncheon attended by his majesty the king and Her 
Majesty Queen Nur and Bill Clinton and the first lady, Hillary 
Rodham Clinton. 
  Yesterday, the king visited the U.S. Congress where he 
conferred with House Speaker Thomas Foley and then the chairman 
and members of the House Foreign Relations Committee. The 
meeting was held at the committee's initiative for an update on 
Middle East developments, and the peace process in particular. 
His majesty the king said Jordan approached the Jordanian track 
from the perspective of the implementation of the joint agenda, 
Jordan's sovereignty and Arab coordination. Jordan, his majesty 
added, will not initiate a separate solution and that, in that 
regard, other Arab parties had gone ahead of Jordan. His majesty 
said that how fast Jordan reaches a settlement with Israel 
largely depends on Israel's accommodation of the requirements of 
peace. 
  Asked about lifting the boycott of Israel, his majesty said 
that depends primarily on the Israeli position on banning 
Jordanian goods bound for Palestinian territory and whether 
Israel will reconsider its protectionist posture on trade. 
  Jordan will extend what support it can for the Palestinian 
brothers to enable them to administer the self-rule areas on a 
case-by-case basis and whenever the Palestinians request 
assistance as needs arise. 
  Asked about fundamentalist movements that raise anti-Western 
slogans, his majesty said extremism was not exclusive to Islam 
and that extremism feeds on extremism. His majesty asserted 
that Islam is a religion of moderation and that he was proud to 
be a Muslim. 
  The House Foreign Relations Committee showed understanding 
for the problems Jordan is facing. Committee members said they 
will support Jordan due its positive approach to the peace 
process and the democratic climate prevailing in the country. 
They also displayed understanding of Jordan's requirements for 
development and defense. The representatives applauded Jordan's 
experiment and hoped it would serve as a model for the region. 
  Later this evening, his majesty will conclude a three-day 
official visit to the United States by meeting with the chairman 
and members of the House Foreign Relations Committee.

<F P=106> [Statements by King Husayn and President Bill Clinton during </F>
a news conference with unidentified correspondents at the White 
House on 22 June -- recorded, in English] 
  [Text] [Clinton] First, I would like to welcome King 
Husayn back to the White House and to say how very much I 
support his courage and vision in renewing his efforts to make 
peace with Israel. I want to reaffirm the support of the United 
States for a comprehensive settlement in the Middle East, 
including the Syrian track, and we will do whatever we can to 
keep those things going. And this remains a very important 
priority for me and for our administration, and I'm very 
encouraged by where we are now in the whole process, and 
especially by the efforts that King Husayn has made. And I'm 
looking forward to having a chance to discuss that with him. 
  [Correspondent] What are the chances, Mr. President and King 
Husayn, of a trilateral summit between you two and Prime 
Minister Rabin? 
  [Husayn] I don't think it is something that has been 
discussed as yet. But in the future [words indistinct]. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty, are you thinking of separate 
peace with Israel? 
  [Husayn] I'm thinking of the beginning of serious 
negotiation on the agenda that was ratified here in Washington 
as rapidly as possible, and this is what we expect at the [word 
indistinct] and the coming period. But beyond that we certainly 
would share with the President our hope that we will have a 
comprehensive peace in the entire region. 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty, according to the World Bank 
report, the economic conditions in Jordan are improving. Will 
this translate into funds and assistance? How do you anticipate 
that the United States will look into that [words indistinct] 
the improved conditions in addition to what the World Bank has 
said that you are doing great to the economic (?situation)... 
  [Husayn, interrupting] Well, we hope that amongst the many 
results of achieving a just, comprehensive peace in the region 
will be a change in the quality of life of people in the region 
as a whole. So, without entering into any detail in that 
regard, I believe that, obviously, that area will be addressed 
in terms of the entire region and the opportunities that peace 
offers, when it comes, are tremendous. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you.

  [Text] His Majesty King Husayn has met the chairman of the 
Foreign Relations Committee at the U.S. Senate, Mr. Claiborne 
Pell, and a number of other senators. During the meeting at the 
Congress in Washington, Mr. Pell praised his majesty's wise 
leadership and his policy towards various regional and 
international issues. 
  His majesty said Jordan has always sought to bring about 
peace in the region, adding that serious work was to begin soon 
to solve all issues on the coming agenda with Israel, signed in 
Washington following the Israeli-Palestinian agreement. His 
majesty pointed that the coming phase is critical and sensitive, 
expressing hope of a new dawn in the region. 
  In answer to a question on Jordan's economy, his majesty the 
king told the senators that Jordan is rebuilding its economy and 
explained the impacts of the Gulf war on this economy. His 
majesty added that such crisis had left Jordan under the big 
burden of debts and voiced hope that peace would ease this 
burden. 
  On Arab coordination, his majesty expressed dissatisfaction 
for the lack of such coordination until now and stressed that 
Jordan is keen on solving all problems on all tracks so as to 
bring about a comprehensive peace capable of improving the 
standard of living for peoples of this region. 
  On the Jordanian-Palestinian relationship, his majesty told 
the U.S. officials that Jordan will do all it can to support 
Palestinian brethren and make their self-rule a success. 
  His majesty's meeting with the senators was attended by the 
prime minister, the chief of the Royal Court, his majesty's 
political and military advisers, and the Jordanian ambassador in 
Washington. 
  His majesty told reporters after the meeting that he 
discussed several issues of common interest with the U.S. 
senators and described the meeting as taking place in a friendly 
atmosphere. 
  Meanwhile, the White House issued a statement on his majesty 
the king's summit meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton last 
night. The statement said President Clinton discussed with King 
Husayn the peace process in the Middle East, in addition to 
regional developments and bilateral relations.

majesty the king in pursuing peace with Israel and pledged 
ongoing U.S. support for the Mideast peace process. Mr. Clinton 
reaffirmed the support of the United States for a comprehensive 
settlement in the Middle East, including the Syrian track.

remains 
a very important priority for him and for the administration and 
added that he was very encouraged by what has been achieved in 
the whole process.

<F P=106> [Report by Hisham Milhim from Washington] </F>
  [Text] Jordan's King Husayn has said the Jordanian-Israeli 
talks, which will begin in the region next month, will be 
difficult, long, and serious, adding that their success will 
depend on Israel and whether it gives up the occupied Jordanian 
territory. He said that nothing justifies questioning the 
recent Jordanian-Israeli agreement and its timing. 
  Interviewed by Radio Monte Carlo, King Husayn said: The 
movement on the Palestinian track makes it unreasonable for 
Jordan to lag behind. He repeated many times that it is time 
Jordan concentrated on guaranteeing its existence and 
continuation and on safeguarding its democratization option and 
political pluralism. King Husayn added that he was surprised by 
Syria's criticism of the agreement, expressing hope that the 
Jordanian-Syrian contacts will resume to discuss integration and 
cooperation between the two countries. 
  Syria, which viewed the agreement as a violation of Arab 
coordination -- particularly following the visit to Damascus by 
the Jordanian monarch -- canceled a scheduled visit to Amman by 
Prime Minister Mahmud al-Zu'bi. 
  Regarding the Syrian position, King Husayn said: 
  [Begin Husayn recording] In fact, I was surprised by the 
Syrian reaction. I have not heard anything from His Excellency 
brother Hafiz al-Asad on a personal level. We have been in 
continuous contact until the latest stage. I paid a visit to 
Damascus, we met, and we discussed all issues. Therefore, I 
believe the political dimension concerning the Middle East 
issues, as well as our decisive and pan-Arab issues, will be 
tackled on our level, myself and my brother the president. 
  Regarding the coordination in general, we used this term and 
did our utmost to achieve it. I am not here dealing with this 
issue in light of the recent Syrian stand, but in light of its 
basis, namely, the Jordanian-Palestinian situation. Our issues 
and interests are interlinked. So, we should be together in 
confronting the dangers facing us. Coordination in the full 
sense of the word has not been achieved yet on any level. Every 
now and then we ask the brothers how far they have gone in their 
talks, or we tell them where we are, if they ask. 
  Our brothers in Syria have their own definite and known 
problems concerning the occupied Syrian territory. We have our 
own problems. Coordination has not reached the level of minor 
details. They, in Syria, might have a longer breath in light of 
their circumstances, situation, and potentials. However, our 
issue and its interlinkage with the Palestinian issue made us 
discuss this issue. Jordan, Syria, the Palestinian brothers, 
and Lebanon started from the same point in Madrid. We are 
seeking a comprehensive peace. This, however, does not mean we 
relinquished our right to address our issues. We also do not 
assume that Syria will relinquish its right to address its 
issues. [end recording]

  [Text] In an interview with the Lebanese newspaper 
AL-SAFIR, King Husayn of Jordan has stated that the latest 
Jordanian agreement with Israel comes within the framework of 
safeguarding the Kingdom of Jordan, its future, and borders. He 
tacitly admitted that this step was a kind of unilateral action. 
He said he was surprised by the Syrian reaction to the 
agreement, saying: Brother President Hafiz al-Asad knows me 
well and our relations are based on truthfulness and sincerity. 
King Husayn said that Arab coordination was mere talk without 
substance.

which began last night, continued this morning on the details 
related to bilateral relations. 
  In a statement to the Jordanian news agency PETRA, Finance 
Minister Sami Qammuh said that the two sides are currently 
discussing bilateral economic issues, adding that there is a 
good U.S. readiness to discuss the details of financial and 
economic issues. 
  He said: We will define the fields in which we can adopt 
serious and quick measures to strengthen Jordan's economy, 
revenues, and balance of payments. 
  He said a serious study is under way of Jordan's debt to the 
United States and other countries. 
  He said the meetings will continue over the next two days to 
complete discussion of the issues at the U.S. State Department 
and the headquarters of the Jordanian delegation.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Ali Hamati from Washington] </F>
  [Text] The joint Jordanian-U.S. committee held its first 
meeting at the U.S. State Department earlier today. 
  Information Minister Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, who chaired the 
Jordanian side, said discussion revolved around the framework 
for the committee's action. The Jordanian foreign debt, 
particularly to the United States, is the most important topic 
on the agenda. 
  Dr. al-'Anani said it has been agreed to reassess the debt 
during the meetings that will be held within the context of the 
Paris Club in the future. 
  It was also agreed during the meeting, which was attended on 
the Jordanian side by Finance Minister Sami Qammuh and Fayiz 
al-Tarawinah, Jordan's ambassador in Washington, that the United 
States will do all it can to reschedule the largest possible 
amount of Jordanian debt for three years, taking into account an 
easing of the terms of rescheduling in terms of the period and 
the interest rate and to support Jordan's position on reducing 
the debt. 
  Dr. al-'Anani said it was agreed to study increasing U.S. 
aid 
to Jordan and that Jordan has made many proposals in this regard 
which the U.S. side promised to study in order to meet the 
feasible ones. 
  As regards the trade links, the information minister and 
head

  [Text] Dawud al-Zir, chairman of the Union of Palestinian 
Contractors, held a news conference today in the press office of 
the embassy of the state of Palestine in Amman. The news 
conference was attended by a number of journalists and media 
figures. 
  During the news conference, brother al-Zir stressed that the 
Palestinian leadership, because of its great eagerness to 
preserve strong, brotherly Palestinian-Jordanian ties, wants to 
give Jordanian contractors an opportunity to work in the 
self-rule areas on an equal footing with their Palestinian 
brothers. 
  Mr. al-Zir called on Palestinian and Jordanian contractors 
to 
now join efforts; huge efforts are required to rebuild the 
infrastructure of Palestinian authority, destroyed by years of 
occupation. He stressed that the projects in the self-rule 
areas will be large and numerous and will encompass all aspects 
of life. 
  He added: The projects under proposal are large and beyond 
the capabilities of local contractors. We have worked together 
with our Jordanian brothers in several countries and we must 
work together again. As the economic agreement between Jordan 
and Palestine provides for free trade between the two countries, 
contracts should also be free from restrictions, he said. 
Brother al-Zir concluded by saying that the agreement to be 
signed by the two countries will include this fundamental issue 
so that Palestinian-Jordanian relations will be strong and free. 
He called on everyone to cooperate, bolster mutual interests, 
and coordinate the conditions of work.

<F P=106> [Interview with Kuwaiti petroleum minister by Randah </F>
Taqi-al-Din in Vienna; date not given: "Kuwait Negotiating With 
India and Pakistan to Build High-Capacity Refineries"--first 
paragraph AL-HAYAH introduction] 
  [Text] Kuwait's new petroleum minister, 'Abd-al-Muhsin 
Mid'aj al-Mid'aj, has said in an interview with AL-HAYAH in 
Vienna that Kuwait would restore its former oil refining 
capacity to what it was before the Iraqi invasion within 10 
years. "Kuwait has made a great deal of progress in its 
negotiations with India and Pakistan to build large and modern 
oil refineries in both countries," he said. He reaffirmed that 
Kuwait rejects the idea that the Iraqi deputy secretary general 
of OPEC, Ramzi Salman, should assume the position of acting 
secretary general, and said that "Kuwait is with the decision of 
the international community on the question of reopening the oil 
pipeline between Iraq and Turkey." 
  The text of the interview follows: 
  [Taqi-al-Din] You are Kuwait's new petroleum minister; do 
you 
want to introduce a new plan for the oil sector? 
  [Al-Mid'aj] The oil sector in Kuwait is constantly 
developing 
and renewing itself. There are plans put into motion by my 
predecessors, and there are new plans whose implementation I 
will oversee in the near future, as Kuwait has emerged from a 
terrible invasion and the destruction of its oil institutions. 
They actually began to rebuild the oil sector after the 
liberation. One thing we are doing is to adopt a new strategy 
for our oil sector in terms of production, export, and oil 
projects outside Kuwait. 
  [Taqi-al-Din] What are the priorities in terms of your oil 
investments outside Kuwait? 
  [Al-Mid'aj] We have a long history of investment outside 
Kuwait; it's nothing new. We have many activities in Europe, the 
United States, East Asia, and the Arab countries. We have 
refineries in Europe, we are investing in the gasoline 
distribution sector, and we are active in oil exploration 
through KUFPEC [Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company]. 
Also, our Santa Fe operations are ongoing abroad--these are 
projects that were operating before, and still are. 
  [Taqi-al-Din] Are there any new ones? 
  [Al-Mid'aj] We are now looking at some new areas and will 
complete our contacts with some of the countries we have 
actually begun to consult with, such as the countries of the Far 
East, to implement new oil production projects and get into 
refining operations. We have now finished one round of 
negotiations with India to build oil refineries there, and we 
also have contacts with Pakistan to start up similar operations 
in the near term. We still have not decided on the capacity of 
these refineries, but I believe they will be modern and 
high-capacity. 
  [Taqi-al-Din] What is your current production capacity? 
  [Al-Mid'aj] We have a production capacity of 2.4 million 
barrels per day [bpd], and we are exporting 2 million. Turning 
to our refining capacity, in 10 years Kuwait will have restored 
its refining capacity to what it was before the invasion. 
Refining capacity in our Kuwaiti refineries will increase by 
nearly 100,000 bpd. (Refining capacity before the invasion 
ranged from 800,000-880,000 bpd.) We are now in the final stages 
of rebuilding the refineries that the Iraqi forces destroyed. 
  [Taqi-al-Din] It appears that the OPEC conference is unable 
to choose a new secretary general, because Iran is nominating 
its ambassador to Tokyo to that post and rejects the will of the 
majority to appoint former Venezuelan minister Alirio Parra. It 
is said that if nothing can be worked out, the Iraqi deputy 
secretary general, Ramzi Salman, will become acting secretary 
general. What do you think? 
  [Al-Mid'aj] It is absolutely unacceptable to us that Deputy 
Secretary General Ramzi Salman be acting secretary general, 
because the person who is given the post must be neutral, and 
because the economic organization must have nothing to do with 
politics. Our view is that the secretary general must be 
neutral; he must not engage in politics, nor should he impose 
the policy of one country, or be closer to one country than 
another. It is a strictly economic organization. I hope we may 
arrive at a solution and appoint a new secretary general who is 
not aligned with any country. 
  [Taqi-al-Din] Are you comfortable with current oil price 
levels? 
  [Al-Mid'aj] We will be comfortable if the oil market 
stabilizes and if prices are reasonable, so there will be no 
upset in the oil market. We do not approve of disruptions in 
prices. We always seek to stabilize them, with the cooperation 
of both sides: the producers and the consumers. Prices are now 
in the process of improving logically and reasonably to the 
point where producers are almost satisfied, and yet the prices 
are not a burden to consumers. 
  [Taqi-al-Din] We hear a great deal these days about how the 
United States has permitted the reopening of an oil pipeline 
from Iraq and Turkey, in order to help Turkey. What is your 
position on this? 
  [Al-Mid'aj] Our position is that of the international 
community: There is an economic danger to Iraq, for well-known 
reasons. We are with the international community, and if it 
makes a decision, we will support it. I believe that the 
international community will not put up with any political game 
the Iraqis may have in mind, but we are with the international 
community in any decision it makes on this subject

  [Text] Kuwait, 20 Jun -- The Court of Appeal today 
confirmed a life sentence handed down to a Kuwaiti national 
convicted of cooperating with troops of the Iraqi regime during 
their occupation of the State of Kuwait, and cancelled a 4 
million dinar fine against him. The same court supported a 
10-year sentence with labor against a Jordanian national who 
will then be deported after serving the full term. It exempted 
him from paying a fine worth more than 2,000 Kuwaiti dinars. 
  A state security court had convicted Ra'd Ibrahim, the 35 
year-old defendant in the first case, in October and sentenced 
him to life imprisonment with labor and without parole. It also 
committed him to pay back 2,630,330 Kuwait dinars as well as a 
fine worth that amount. 
  As for the defendant in the second case, Nasir Muhammad 
Mahmud, a 50 year-old Jordanian national, who was convicted of 
collaborating with the Iraqi regime, undermining the loyalty of 
the Kuwaiti armed forces and lowering their morale by writing 
articles against the State of Kuwait in a newspaper called 
AL-NIDA' [passage indistinct]
