<F P=106> [Interview with Prince Sultan Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz Al Sa'ud, </F>
second deputy prime minister, defense minister, and aviation and 
inspector general, by unidentified correspondents at the King 
Faysal airbase; date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] [sentence indistinct] 
  [Al Sa'ud] The important thing is that youth--university 
graduates who believe in God--have joined the armed forces. I 
am very happy to see that. 
  [Correspondent] Your Highness give us more details on the 
recent announcement on the establishment of a military base in 
the south? 
  [Al Sa'ud] First, the announcement was not made recently; it 
was made two years ago. Studies and surveys have already been 
done. If a number of foreign stations and radios have linked 
the announcement the current situation in Yemen, it is false 
reporting. The announcement was made two years ago; surveys 
have been completed. The base will open next year, God willing. 
  [Correspondent] Will Your Highness please expand on the 
problem of the Iraqi refugees? Although the kingdom has spent 
around two billion Saudi riyals since the setting up of the 
refugee camps in Rafhah, foreign media has nevertheless been 
saying that the Kingdom mistreats the Iraqi refugees. How do 
you answer that? 
  [Al Sa'ud] Anyone who feels sorry for them should take them 
to his own country. 
  [Correspondent] What about compulsory conscription? Is the 
idea going to be revived? 
  [Al Sa'ud] We do not need it; our youth have shown more than 
enough enthusiasm. We have to accommodate the young enthusiasts 
first. 
  [Correspondent] Did the Ministry of Defense benefit during 
the Gulf war from the Saudi brothers who volunteered to serve in 
the army? 
  [Al Sa'ud] A lot. It has benefitted a lot; many of them 
joined military academies. 
  [Correspondent] What about al-Yamamah project? 
  [Al Sa'ud] It is still on track. 
  [Correspondent] What about relations with Iran, who has 
asserted that the Kingdom mistreated the pilgrims? 
  [Al Sa'ud] Pilgrims were never mistreated. We hope that our 
relations with Iran will be excellent. This is the policy of the 
custodian of the two holy mosques. 
  [Correspondent] What about prisoners from Gulf Cooperation 
Council countries still held by the Iraqi regime? 
  [Al Sa'ud] This matter is being examined by the UN Security 
Council. We hope with God's help that every man will return to 
his country. Thank you. 
  [Correspondent] Your Highness, when will the academy move to 
the new building? 
  [Al Sa'ud] Work is progressing normally; the academy will 
move there in two years' time.

  [Text] Saudi security agencies have put out a contract on 
the opposition figure Shaykh Usamah Bin-Ladin. They assigned 
the job to an assassination group, led by a hit man from an Arab 
country. 
  The London-based Committee for the Defense of (Saudi) 
Legitimate Rights said that Saudi Arabia, which has paid a huge 
sum to this gang, is apparently trying to stay away from the 
assassination attempt for domestic reasons connected with tribal 
vendettas and external reasons connected with the image of Saudi 
Arabia abroad. 
  In a related development, Usamah's mother was surprised when 
a police officer prevented her from boarding a plane that was 
about to take off, even though she had completed airport 
formalities on her way to be treated abroad from an incurable 
disease.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Salim Salih Muhammad, member of </F>
the Presidential Council in the "Democratic Republic of Yemen," 
by Muhammad 'Allam in Cairo; date not given: "Salih Tells 
AL-HAYAH: We Will Resist the Fundamentalist State in Sanaa"] 
  [Text] Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the Presidential 
Council of the "Democratic Republic of Yemen" [DRY], has 
confirmed that the Cairo meetings which began the day before 
yesterday between Lakhdar Brahimi, envoy of the UN secretary 
general, and delegations from north and south Yemen to find a 
mechanism for the promotion and consolidation of a cease-fire, 
have failed.. He attributed this to many reasons including the 
level of the northern delegation and the other side's insistence 
on fighting and failure to honor Security Council resolution 
924. Salim Salih, who is also the assistant secretary general 
of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], ruled out intervention by 
the Arab League to bring these talks under its supervision. 
  In an interview with AL-HAYAH, Salih accused the Security 
Council of being slow. He praised the U.S. position because "it 
is balanced and views the issue as something which concerns not 
only Yemen but also the Gulf region and the entire Arabian 
Peninsula." He urged the Security Council and the international 
community to "pass deterrent resolutions against the Sanaa 
government," and he emphasized that "Democratic Yemen will on 
its own resist the threat of the fundamentalist state in Sanaa 
until the brothers and friends understand the situation." He 
pointed out that "the Sanaa government is at present carrying 
out imamite practices (reference to the imams reign) in the 
villages." 
  He spoke of the "existence of Egyptian and Arab recognition 
of Democratic Yemen and said that such recognition exists and is 
implied." 
  He expressed "pessimism" about the Brahimi initiative's 
chances of success. He said: "The composition of the northern 
delegation and the reports from Aden about the other side's 
movements and concentrations around Aden and its criticism of 
the Gulf states all reflect the Sanaa government's determination 
to escalate and not to comply with the cease-fire resolutions." 
He added that "the northern delegation has no authorization to 
order a cease-fire or consolidate a cease-fire. To them it is a 
question of circumventing these efforts and continuing to try to 
gain time in order to continue the war. The northern 
delegation's level of representation reflected Sanaa's lack of 
credibility as far as a positive response to UN resolution 924 
was concerned. It also showed that they were playing games with 
the fate and blood of the people, with no indication of a desire 
to spare blood or respond to the appeals for an end to the war." 
He added that "the composition of the delegation of Democratic 
Yemen under the leadership of Deputy Prime Minister and Planning 
Minister Muhsin Abu-Bakr Bin-Farid demonstrated our welcome and 
positive response to the international efforts and Lakhdar 
Brahimi's initiative." 
  Asked why were the Cairo meetings not held at Arab League 
headquarters and under Arab League auspices, Salim Salih said: 
"We are now working for the implementation of Security Council 
Resolution 924, disengagement of forces, and the start of 
negotiations. We welcomed Lakhdar Brahimi's initiative but the 
other side refuses to comply with that resolution and is still 
shelling Aden and sending military reinforcements from the north 
to the battlefields in defiance of the Arab and international 
will." 
  He accused the Security Council of "being slow" and added: 
"Developments in terms of the fighting make it necessary for 
the Security Council and the international community to act and 
adopt deterrent resolutions against the aggressor party, which 
continues to violate the cease-fire while the whole world looks 
on without appropriate reaction." He said: "What matters to us 
now is that immediate and practical measures should be taken to 
deter the occupation forces and the invaders and prevent the 
extermination of the citizens in the south." 
  He described the U.S. position as "balanced and interested 
in 
security and stability because it views what is taking place in 
Yemen as something which concerns not only Yemen but also the 
situation in the Gulf states and the entire Arabian Peninsula." 
He said that the U.S. government's warning to the Sanaa 
government regarding the shelling of Aden "reflects a political 
position." 
  Asked if during his meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister 
'Amr Musa the day before yesterday they discussed the question 
of Egyptian and Arab recognition of Democratic Yemen, he 
replied: "Egyptian and Arab recognition of Democratic Yemen 
exists and is implicit." He stressed that "the world now 
actually recognizes Democratic Yemen as an existing entity on 
the grounds that there was no progress at the level of the unity 
merger between the Yemeni Republic in the north and the DRY in 
the south." 
  He added: "At any rate, recognition is not the urgent issue 
now. What is required is a cease-fire and the preservation of 
what is left of Yemen after the attacks on economic, vital, and 
civilian establishments and the destruction of the country's 
resources." 
  On the turn the war has taken and the fact that some 
northern 
leaderships see this war as a "holy and religious" war, he 
affirmed that "the Arab brothers and friends should understand 
the danger of the mentality, dream, and ambition of controlling 
Yemen with a view to building a fundamentalist state." He 
warned that "the danger of such a state would be a threat not 
only to Yemen but also to all states in the Arab region." He 
also said: "Democratic Yemen is not facing an internal 
situation. There is a fundamentalist movement with clear trends 
and affiliations with certain parties who interfere in our 
affairs, especially Iran, Sudan, and Iraq." He added: "We had 
warned against that danger and now we are resisting it alone. 
The brothers and friends should understand that."

implement Security Council Resolution 924 under Yemeni unity and 
constitutional legitimacy. He will also explain to UN and U.S. 
officials the violations committed by rebels against 
international legitimacy represented by Security Council 
Resolution 924 in an attempt to circumvent the content of the 
resolution to achieve illegitimate objectives.

  [Excerpt] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council, today met with leaders and 
representatives of political parties and organizations. He 
briefed them on the latest developments in the situation on the 
national, political, and military fronts. He also briefed them 
on the efforts that have been exerted on the foreign level and 
the nature of the talks that have been held with Lakhdar 
Brahimi, envoy of the UN secretary general. 
  The brother president explained that from the outset, our 
country stressed its abidance by UN Security Council Resolution 
No. 924 and its full readiness to implement it. He added that 
our country proposed five cease-fire initiatives to stop Yemeni 
bloodshed and to give those who have been misled a chance to 
join the ranks of unity and legitimacy. 
  The brother president said the leaders of rebellion and 
secession insisted on (?rejecting) all initiatives because the 
UN Security Council resolution did not serve their inhuman and 
anti-unity objectives. They continued to violate the cease-fire 
and to escalate the military situation in order to prolong the 
war and internationalize the Yemeni issue. 
  The brother president praised the political parties and 
organizations for their principled stand on the challenges 
facing national unity at this delicate phase in the history of 
the homeland. He also praised their commitment to national 
issues. He said that the challenges facing the homeland have 
proven the credibility of the people's national stands and 
cohesion as they confront the enemies of the homeland, unity, 
and democracy. He stressed that our country will continue to 
adhere to the option of unity and democracy as an irreversible 
option to build a modern Yemen based on the principles of 
political and party pluralism, economic freedom, the freedom of 
expression, respect for human rights, developed local 
government, and progress and comprehensive development 
throughout Yemen. 
  The brother president indicated that the next phase requires 
cooperation and cohesion among our people to rebuild what the 
treasonous, rebellious gang has destroyed in all fields, 
starting with supporting the families of the martyrs' and 
victims in all governorates. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] The cabinet held a periodic meeting under Acting 
Prime Minister brother Dr. Muhammad Sa'id al-'Attar this 
morning. It discussed topics on the agenda. Discussions focused 
on the supply situation in the republic and on the regulations 
governing the distribution of the necessary foods and consumer 
goods. 
  The cabinet set up a working team to directly supervise all 
storing, distribution, and transportation operations in order to 
secure regular delivery of all these goods to all governorates. 
This is because supplying the necessary commodities to citizens 
will complement and enhance all military and political field 
activities. 
  The cabinet stressed the need for contributions by all 
official and popular organizations and institutions. It also 
emphasized the need to pool all efforts in order to make 
successful the transportation and distribution operations, 
disburse the stored commodities, and solve the problems 
pertaining to transportation and distribution operations, in 
addition to organizing the monitoring operations, implementing 
strict measures against those who violate the supply regulations 
and laws, and addressing this issue with seriousness and high 
discipline on the part of the institutions in charge of control. 
  The cabinet also discussed a memorandum submitted by the 
brother minister of planning and development requesting approval 
of an agreement between the Yemeni government and the Arab Fund 
[not further identified] on financing a project to rehabilitate 
the electric, water, and sewage disposal installations in Aden, 
the economic and commercial capital. The cabinet approved this 
agreement and asked the parties concerned to make all 
arrangements in order to accomplish this vital project for Aden, 
the economic and commercial capital. 
  In view of what the forces rebelling against the 
constitutional legitimacy are carrying out in terms of 
subversive and destructive acts against the vital economic 
installations--the latest of which was the raid on the power 
station in Mocha, in the governorate of Ta'izz, which inflicted 
serious damage, martyred 17 citizens mostly women and children, 
and wounded 33 others--the cabinet expressed its indignation and 
condemned these continued crimes committed by the rebels against 
public property and vital facilities of the homeland and 
citizens. It also emphasized that those who commit these 
treacherous crimes will receive punishment sooner or later as 
criminals acting against the people and the homeland. 
  Moreover, the cabinet saluted the valiant Armed Forces' 
great 
efforts to protect all national gains and achievements, 
safeguard the civilian and vital installations and public 
utilities, and maintain security and stability. It stressed the 
need to increase vigilance in order to foil all hostile and 
conspiratorial schemes designed to fragment the homeland and 
destroy its resources and capabilities. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, member of the </F>
Presidential Council in Sanaa, by Sawsan Abu-Husayn in Cairo; 
date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Abu-Husayn] It is expected that Security 
Council states may recognize the Democratic Republic of Yemen 
[DRY] in the near future. How will you deal with this reality? 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] First of all, the Security Council's 
position is very clear through Resolution 924, which proceeds 
from the UN Charter and stipulates the independence and 
sovereignty of the state, that is the Arab Republic of Yemen 
proclaimed on 22 May 1990. Besides, in one of its drafts, the 
resolution stipulates that it is an application of Article 34. 
This was omitted because it concerns disputes between two 
states or more. So the resolution talks about what is happening 
in the Republic of Yemen. There is no indication at all that 
the recognition question is on the cards. 
  [Abu-Husayn] Recognition is on the way, as southern leaders 
say, because of Sanaa's rigidity and failure to comply with the 
Security Council resolution. What is your opinion? 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] That is untrue. Sanaa complied with and 
implemented Resolution 924. Actually the fighting was halted 
for six hours the first time, but the other side violated it. 
On the eve of the blessed 'Id al-Adha and on the occasion of 
the unity's fourth anniversary our legitimate forces complied 
with the cease-fire, but Aden did not, and announced the 
secession. The fourth time, we complied, but Aden announced its 
decision to form a government. 
  We are the legitimate government, and it is in our interests 
to have a cease-fire. But it is in the rebellious side's 
interests to continue to fight and to keep the issue alive on 
the front pages of newspapers. And it is in its interests for 
the United Nations to continue to issue statements and 
resolutions, while we complied and welcomed the UN secretary 
general's envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, and we sent our delegation to 
Cairo to engage in a dialogue, and we conceded some of the 
demands we had stressed. 
  [Abu-Husayn] Like what? 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] That the dialogue should not be conducted in 
the tripartite coalition framework, but, rather, in the Republic 
of Yemen framework in implementation of the Security Council 
resolution, but the southern leadership refused because it 
wanted the meeting to be held in the framework of two states. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Abu-Husayn] What is your opinion of your bombardment of 
cities and residential areas and killing of civilians? 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] First of all, we are not targeting any 
citizen, civilian or military. This war is imposed on us by 
some Socialist Party leaders, not all of them. Because the 
Socialist Party is unionist, and it had the honor of signing the 
unity agreement with the General People's Congress. This is why 
I say that the rebels in the south are using civilians as human 
shields for military purposes and so that public opinion will 
sympathize with them. I wonder here: What view does public 
opinion take of shelling Sanaa with the internationally banned 
Scud missiles, which claimed the lives of 23 citizens? [passage 
omitted] 
  [Abu-Husayn] Despite all you say, the siege is imposed on 
Aden, and there are northern intentions to burn it. 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] That is untrue. We will not burn Aden, 
because Aden has not responded to the secessionists. It has 
expelled them, and they now live in world capitals and in safe 
areas. All governorates of the Republic of Yemen reject these 
people, who have rebelled against legitimacy and portray 
themselves as the victims. 
  [Abu-Husayn] But the people of the south celebrated the 
DRY's proclamation on 22 May 1990. 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] That is untrue. That state and its 
leadership were not set up through elections or a referendum. 
So we wonder: Under what legitimacy does it rule or represent 
the people of the south? 
  [Abu-Husayn] It seems that the dispute is not over unity, 
but, rather, the way in which it was established, because the 
south has not ignored the unity, and some southern leaders say 
that secession has been imposed on them. 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] True, no Yemeni will dare reject the unity. 
And if the dispute is over the form of the unity, why have 
southern leaders rejected the new formulas which we spent months 
negotiating? I was a member of the dialogue committee with 
Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, and we reached the Pledge and Accord 
Document by dint of strenuous efforts and continued dialogues, 
but southern leaders rejected this document. 
  [Abu-Husayn] But they are demanding that Sanaa comply with 
the stipulations of the document, saying that the southern state 
was established on the basis of the principles stipulated in it. 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] That is designed for public opinion. 
[passage 
omitted] 
  [Abu-Husayn] I ask you again, and I want a specific answer: 
Is it possible to return to a unified state in these conditions? 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] Why not? Yes, it is possible, provided the 
people of Yemen are left alone. We are confident that, if that 
happens, we will find solutions to problems, because what 
complicates the problem is internationalizing and Arabizing it. 
Thus we urge the brothers and friends to focus their efforts on 
supporting unity, and to stop supporting one group against 
another. They should support the wish of the Yemeni people, who 
welcomed unity on 22 May 1990. 
  [Abu-Husayn] Will the abolition of the southern state be 
among the solutions? 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] Yes, the southern state should be abolished, 
and unity between the two peoples, not two states, established. 
I requested a meeting yesterday with the brothers from the 
Socialist Party, especially Salim Salih, who was in Cairo, but 
he left Cairo and refused to meet with me because he wanted the 
meeting to be held on the basis of two states -- which is 
unacceptable. [passage omitted] 
  [Abu-Husayn] The south believes that Resolution 924 means 
halting the fighting first and then engaging in a dialogue. 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] That is true, but in addition to a phrase 
which says, in the framework of the Republic of Yemen. We are 
willing to do that, and I announce through AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT 
that we accept an immediate halt to the fighting as of this very 
moment, and the time now is 6:30. But I have to receive a 
telephone call from the other party, announcing its acceptance 
of this, then we would agree on an unconditional dialogue and on 
the first matter, that is, a halt to the fighting. The second 
matter is dialogue: let us negotiate everything within the 
framework of the Republic of Yemen, legitimacy, and the Security 
Council resolution. [passage omitted] 
  [Abu-Husayn] How will you deal with the Security Council 
resolution if they are stepped up to the point of imposing 
sanctions? 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] We have not committed a crime for us to be 
punished, nor have we fought anyone outside our borders. 
  [Abu-Husayn] What about the results of your meeting with 
Lakhdar Brahimi in Cairo? 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] The meeting was very good. We spoke about 
the importance of implementing the Security Council resolution, 
I stressed Sanaa's readiness for that, and we agreed to continue 
consultations and contacts. 
  [Abu-Husayn] With regard to the Arab League's role, do you 
want it to continue its endeavors? 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] Why not? Especially as the League has said 
from the outset that what is happening in Yemen concerns the 
Yemenis. 
  [Abu-Husayn] What is the position of both Iraq and Iran 
toward you, especially in light of the accusations that they are 
supporting you militarily? 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] First of all, Iraq is currently being 
subjected to an embargo, and if an ant moves out of it, it is 
under close watch. Second, we are capable of protecting unity 
and need not import people to defend our unity. 
  As for Iran, it supports unity politically, and we welcome 
the position adopted by it or by any other state.

<F P=106> [Report by Amir Taheri, Lutfi Shatarah, Hanan al-Badri, and </F>
Sawsan Abu-Husayn: "Arab Inclination To Consider Yemeni War 
Threat to Region's Stability"] 
  [Excerpts] London, Washington, Cairo, Sanaa, Aden, AL-SHARQ 
AL-AWSAT -- Yesterday, diplomatic sources in Washington and 
London told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the United States and Britain 
have agreed to step up efforts to achieve an immediate 
cease-fire in Aden after northern forces stepped up their 
bombardment of the city in an indication -- so it seems -- that 
Sanaa is preparing to launch an all-out offensive to storm the 
city following the failure of the efforts made by the UN 
secretary general's special envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, to secure a 
cease-fire. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, the southern leadership is intensifying its 
diplomatic moves to step up Arab and international political 
pressure to force Sanaa to observe a cease-fire and enter 
negotiations to secure a peaceful solution to the situation. 
Southern Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas and Foreign 
Minister 'Abdallah al-Asnaj headed for Washington yesterday to 
hold talks with the U.S. Administration. 
  Al-Asnaj told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT during his stopover in 
London 
yesterday that he and al-'Attas will brief the U.S. 
Administration on the latest developments and the total damage, 
rocket shelling, and heavy artillery bombardment to which Aden 
and Lahij are being subjected. He said they will urge the UN 
Security Council to take further practical deterrent measures to 
prevent further disasters. 
  He stressed that they will meet with the UN secretary 
general 
to discuss Brahimi's report and to reemphasize Aden's commitment 
to implementing the stipulations of the Security Council 
resolution without any reservations. [passage omitted] 
  In Aden, military reports have revealed that 5,000 "Jihad" 
organization elements, among them foreigners belonging to the 
so-called "Afghan Arabs" organization, have arrived in the 
(northern) Red Sea port of al-Hudaydah. The reports stressed 
that these elements have been moved to the frontlines of the 
northern forces besieging Aden.

  [Text] A responsible source at the Democratic Republic of 
Yemen Defense Ministry has stated the following: The forces of 
the ruling military regime in Sanaa today continued their 
desperate offensive attempts to advance in the direction of the 
capital, Aden. At the same time, they continued their rocket, 
air, and artillery shelling of residential quarters and economic 
and service installations in Aden, while our Armed Forces 
confronted them bravely. 
  Our Armed Forces prevented any advances by the enemy, and 
forced him to withdraw and abandon numerous occupied positions. 
They also inflicted further human and material losses on him. 
The enemy losses were as follows: 20 tanks, 10 crews members 
[atqum], five Katyusha rocket launching vehicles, a MiG-21 jet, 
and hundreds of killed and wounded. 
  In Shabwah Governorate, our forces, in close coordination 
with the tribes of Shabwah and popular resistance detachments, 
continued liquidating scattered remnants and pockets of the 
forces of the ruling military regime in Sanaa. Our forces 
managed to capture (al-Qat) Camp, two trucks loaded with 
ammunition, and supply goods. 
  In Ma'rib Governorate, popular resistance detachments 
destroyed a meeting site for leaders and supporters of the 
military regime in Sanaa. In Wadi (Tubah), two troop trucks 
were completely destroyed. Battles are still continuing on all 
combat fronts between our defending forces and the (?oppressive) 
and aggressive forces of the ruling military regime in Sanaa. 
Victory is our ally, God willing.

  [Text] Aden, 22 June, KUNA -- At noon today, southern 
antiaircraft defenses shot down a northern warplane that was 
raiding Aden. A southern military source has said that the 
aircraft was trying to raid the television station, which is 
situated in the mountainous al-Tawahi region. 
  He added that the northern warplanes conducted more raids on 
Aden a few hours after the airport was the target of a Katyusha 
barrage from a northern military launcher. He pointed out that 
the shells did not hit the airport, but a number of ordinary 
houses were damaged instead. The source did not give any 
details on the damage of the missile barrage. 
  KUNA's correspondent, however, saw a number of fire engines 
heading to the areas close to the airport, which is situated in 
the Khur Maksar district in the heart of the city of Aden.

  [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 23 (AFP) -- The bombardment of 
Aden by northern forces resumed at dawn Thursday, with shells 
and missiles wounding 11 civilians, the city's main hospital 
said. 
  As artillery duels between north and south continued near 
Aden, three southern soldiers were reported killed and 28 
wounded. Nine residents of the northern district of Shaykh 
'Uthman were wounded by shells falling on the city itself at the 
rate of two or three a minute, mainly landing near the airport, 
the al-Jumhuriyah hospital said. 
  A southern military spokesman said three missiles were fired 
at Aden, two of which were brought down by anti-aircraft fire. 
The third exploded on the hills overlooking the town, near the 
al-Tawahi district. The hospital said two women were wounded in 
the blast, which badly damaged a number of wooden homes in the 
district.

  [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 23 (AFP) -- A heavy northern 
bombardment of this southern city killed 12 civilians and 
wounded 98 on Thursday as shells slammed into the fish market 
and other central sites, hospital officials said. 
  Wounded soldiers were meanwhile pouring into military 
hospitals from frontlines 20 kilometres (12 miles) from the city 
where dawn artillery duels left three southern troops dead and 
28 wounded, the officials said. 
  Two shells hit the fish market at al-Mu'alla on the sea 
front, killing two people and wounded around a dozen others, 
several seriously. A salvo of Kaytusha rockets destroyed five 
houses in the working class district of al-Mansurah. Shells also 
hit the Khormaksar district near the airport and northern 
suburbs near the front. 
  A southern military spokesman said three missiles were also 
fired at Aden, two of which were brought down by anti-aircraft 
fire. The third exploded on the hills overlooking the town, 
injuring two women and damaging wooden houses. 
  Northern forces loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 
southerners backing his rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid have been locked 
in civil war for almost two months.

  [Text] President 'Arafat, head of the State of Palestine 
and chairman of the PLO's Executive Committee, today received 
Yevgeniy Primakov, director of foreign intelligence of the 
Russian Federation, and the delegation accompanying him. 
  A full review was made of: developments in the Palestinian 
arena, particularly in the occupied territories; the results 
thus far of the implementation of the agreement on Palestinian 
self-rule in Gaza and Jericho as a means of strengthening the 
pillars of the Palestinian national authority; the need for the 
withdrawal of Israeli troops from the self-rule territories; as 
well as the requirements for consolidating the structures of the 
national authority. 
  President 'Arafat expressed gratitude for Russia's firm 
stance in its capacity as one of the cosponsors of the Middle 
East peace process, assessed highly the close relations between 
Russia and Palestine, and stressed the need for strengthening

  During the meeting, Primakov reaffirmed his country's firm 
stance in supporting the peace process and in firmly 
establishing the basis and structures of the Palestinian 
National Authority.

  [Text] Viktor Antilov, secretary general of the Russian 
Communist Workers Party [title as heard], has stressed that the 
Russian people are standing alongside the Palestinian people in 
their struggle to regain their rights to self-determination, the 
establishment of an independent Palestinian state, and 
repatriation. He added that the Russian people also support 
peace in accordance with the resolutions of international 
legitimacy. 
  During a meeting with Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of 
the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP], 
Antilov also asserted that the people of Russia, as well as its 
democratic and communist nationalist forces, support the 
Palestinian people and the Arabs, and that the Russian people 
will not remain silent on the expansionist Israeli plans. 
  For his part, Hawatimah asserted that the Oslo-Cairo 
agreement is doomed to failure because it does not meet the 
minimum requirements of a peace settlement according to the 
resolutions of international legitimacy and also because the 
Israeli occupation and settlements continue to exist in Gaza and 
Jericho, as do the acts of bloody repression throughout the 
occupied territories.

<F P=106> [Report by Qeren Neubach] </F>
  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said today that 
Syria possesses new Scud missiles which pose an even greater 
threat than the ones Iraq had during the Gulf war. Rabin made 
this observation in an address to the Zionist General Council 
conference. Some of the conference participants, who paraded 
with anti-government placards, were taken out of the auditorium. 
Qeren Neubach reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Neubach] [passage omitted] After the 
protesters were removed, Rabin was able to speak undisturbed. 
He devoted a major part of his speech to the military threat 
from Arab countries. Those who claim that the Arab world has no 
military option against us, Rabin asserted, are frivolous and 
irresponsible. 
  [Rabin] What is happening today in the Arab and Muslim 
world? In addition to the Scud-B and Scud-C missiles, Syria has 
just received production capability from North Korea. And, 
believe me, the quantity and the quality of the Syrian 
surface-to-surface missiles makes the Iraqi missiles, to which 
we were subjected during the Gulf war, child's play. 
  [Neubach] As for the peace process, the prime minister said 
that the only peace attained so far was achieved after Israel 
responded to all the territorial demands of Egypt, its 
negotiating partner at that time. 
  [Rabin] Those who say we should have peace as well as the 
entire Golan are saying there will be no peace. There can be no 
such thing! [end recording] 
  [Reporting on the same Rabin address, Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el 
in Hebrew at 1600 GMT on 22 June adds: "Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin said that what will avert war is the number of tanks on 
the Golan Heights, and not the number of settlements. It may be 
annoying, but it is a fact, the prime minister said."]

but, Rabin added, peace without concessions is impossible. The 
prime minister was addressing the annual conference of the Qeren 
Hayesod, the United Israel Appeal, in Jerusalem. 
  [Begin Rabin recording] Those who tell you that we can 
achieve peace just for peace, peace without all Golan Heights, 
lie to you. If they could, why they didn't succeed to achieve 1 
per mill of the area of the Sinai? How can they mitigate that 
for peace with Egypt you have to return till the last square 
inch and to say that vis-a-vis Syria, we can achieve peace just 
for peace? Total nonsense, total nonsense! Whoever would like 
to say that he is for all the Golan Heights, he has to prepare 
for war three, five years, or seven years from now or ten years 
from now. 
  We tried to achieve compromise. We have not yet succeeded. 
I hope that the visit of King Husayn in the United States will 
bring about the resumption of the talks -- not in Washington, 
here, in the area. I don't need any more the Madrid peace 
conference but as a background. I need now bilateral talks with 
every Arab partner. [end recording] 
  [Jerusalem THE JERUSALEM POST in English on 23 June on page 
1 
carries a similar report on Rabin's address by Batsheva Tsur and 
news agencies. The report quotes Rabin as saying that "Iraq 
tried to develop nuclear weapons. Iran is trying to do this. 
Against whom, if not against Israel?" 
  ["Rabin said, `There is consensus in Israel about keeping 
Gush 'Etzyon, Ma'ale Adumim and the Jordan Valley under Israeli 
control for security and not political reasons,' and added that 
Jerusalem must remain united forever as Israel's capital." 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0405 GMT on 23 June 
carries a report by Esti Perez about an impromptu news 
conference held by Rabin at the end of his address. In a 
recorded passage, Rabin says: "I hope very much that what was 
agreed in the trilateral U.S.- Israel-Jordan meeting in 
Washington on economic issues and in the bilateral contacts will 
be pursued in July in our region, which would be much simpler 
than traveling to Washington." 
  [Referring to a meeting with King Husayn, Rabin says: "The 
reported possibility of a public meeting exists. I think that 
in addition to such a meeting, it is very important to make 
progress in the negotiations on the components that will 
ultimately enable the signing of a peace treaty between Israel 
and Jordan." 
  [Perez adds that the prime minister disclosed that he is 
scheduled to meet with Palestinian elements next Monday to 
discuss what he described as outstanding issues. In a recorded 
passage, Rabin says: "Many issues were left pending. For 
example, the international passages are not yet operating in 
accordance with the agreement and the question of the safe 
passages and civilian issues remain unresolved."]

  [Text] Kathmandu, June 17 (AFP) -- The head of the ruling 
Nepali Congress (NC) party Friday [17 June] again called for the 
removal of Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, a party source 
said. 
  Ganesh Man Singh returned to the capital Friday after 
launching a five-day "Remove Prime Minister Girija Prasad 
Koirala and save democracy" campaign in southwestern Nepal. 
Singh also boycotted an NC Central Working Committee (NCCWC) 
meeting which was attended by the prime minister and other NC 
members including party president, Krishna Prasad Bhattarai. 
The NCCWC meeting was held 10 weeks after its last meeting at 
which the committee authorized Bhattarai to take action against 
Koirala for his alleged role in upsetting Bhattarai's election 
chances in a February by-election. 
  Bhattarai supporters have said that speeches made prior to 
the election by Koirala were detrimental to the party chief and 
damaged his election chances. But at the meeting the party 
chief appeared to signal a change in his stand, party sources 
said. 
  "Bhattarai had earlier wanted to remove Koirala for the 
deceptive role played against him but now he seems to be growing 
a soft corner for the prime minister," a highly placed NC source 
said. "Now Singh is not happy with Bhattarai because he is 
trying to save Koirala's head," the source said. 
  The next meeting of the NCCWC is scheduled to be held in 
Pokhara, west of here, on June 22 after it ended Friday 
inconclusively, the source said. 
  During his five-day whirlwind tour Singh spoke to party rank 
and file, attacking the prime minister's alleged failings and 
the "deceptive role" played by Bhattarai who, he said, was 
trying to save Koirala. Singh told the NC youth members, 
activists and district leaders that he would not compromise on 
the issue. 
  "If Koirala continues to be in office for the remaining two 
years, the Nepali Congress will lose the May 1996 general 
elections, not to talk of getting a two-thirds majority of 
votes," Singh said.

<F P=106> [Commentary by the News Research and Commentary Group] </F>
  [Text] The Zionist regime's aggressing warplanes carried 
out further military operations in south Lebanon last night in 
conjunction with intense attacks on residential areas by their 
artillery deployed in the occupied areas in the south. This 
resulted in human and material losses among the civilian 
population. 
  This was the third aerial attack by the Zionist regime's 
fighter bombers on Lebanon's residential areas in the past two 
days following the valiant operations by the Islamic Resistance 
against the Zionist usurpers. On 'Ashura, the combatants of the 
Islamic Resistance attacked the Zionist aggressors inside the 
areas they occupy, emulating the lord of the martyrs. 
  Instead of the Zionist regime terminating its 16-year 
occupation of the border strip in south Lebanon under pressure 
of international public opinion--by withdrawing--it continues 
its policy of blind terrorism with the support of foreign and 
international powers. The Zionist regime attacks residential 
areas in a blind and cowardly manner with its bombers and 
artillery. The Zionist regime's pretext for these acts of 
aggression and the repeated violation of international norms is 
that it is combating the cells of the Islamic liberation 
struggle against the usurpers. In reality, the Zionist regime 
is pursuing other political objectives. 
  Political experts believe that the Tel Aviv echelons are 
striving to bare their fangs and talons in these operations 
before the visit by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
to the Middle East. This visit implies that the wheels of 
diplomatic machinery have been set in motion and therefore the 
Zionist regime--this uninvited and inauspicious guest in the 
region--feels that before he arrives it should show off its 
fangs and talons to its host country to impose peace from a 
position of strength. 
  It is no coincidence that at the same time as the bombing of 
south Lebanon the Zionist regime's Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
should participate directly in military maneuvers in the 
occupied Golan Heights, which belong to Syria. Interesting that 
during these maneuvers Rabin expressed his dissatisfaction with 
the current talks in Washington and called for direct talks with 
Syria. 
  It can be concluded from such behavior that the occupying 
Zionist regime is first willing to embark on all kinds of 
atrocities and second is also enjoying international immunity 
and the support of world powers in this regard. The Lebanese 
Government has realized the regime's political objectives and 
has adopted a completely appropriate stance by extending its 
serious support to the anti-Zionist resistance as the country's 
legitimate right. This means that the Zionist regime will reap 
nothing from these crimes but disgrace.

  [Text] Manama, June 22 (AFP) -- UN weapons inspectors said 
Wednesday [22 June] they were satisfied with Iraq's cooperation 
during their nine-day fact-finding mission there. 
  The team of nine ballistic weapons experts received answers 
to their questions about Iraq's missile programme, UN 
coordinator Roald Opsahl said here. 
  Opsahl said the team wanted to "check earlier information" 
on 
Iraq's missile capacity. The United Nations has banned missiles 
with a range of more than 150 kilometres (93 miles) in Iraq. 
  The team, led by Frenchman Patrice Palanque, returned to 
Bahrain Wednesday and will now set up a long-term system to 
monitor Iraqi weaponry, he said. 
  Another team of four members, led by Briton Gary Dillon, 
arrived in Iraq Tuesday, Opsahl added. 
  The team is to install surveillance cameras at sites where 
Iraq could restart its nuclear programme. 
  Meeting UN Security Council Resolution 687 on destroying its 
weapons of mass destruction is a condition for lifting the UN 
embargo on Baghdad, imposed when Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 
1990.

  [Excerpts] Kuwait City, 22 June, (KUNA) -- Kuwaiti Oil 
Minister Dr. Abd al-Muhsin al-Mid'ij today said "Kuwait will ask 
for a new production quota when OPEC examines the subject of a 
higher production ceiling," which could be discussed owing to 
the stability of the oil market and increasing oil prices. 
  In an interview with KUNA, al-Mid'ij pointed out that Kuwait 
would ask for the quota allocated to her before the tyrannical 
Iraqi invasion -- 2.2 million barrels a day. Minister al-Mid'ij 
attributed this Kuwaiti demand to two reasons: first, that 
"this is the minimum of our rights since they should be equal to 
those of other states"; second, that Kuwait's production 
capacity is estimated at 2.4 million barrels a day. 
  Al-Mid'ij also said he hoped Kuwait's request would be 
granted. [passage omitted] 
  Concerning the foreign participation in the oil sector, the 
Kuwaiti minister said "it is still under review and we expect to 
reach a final idea about it by the end of this year." 
  Al-Mid'ij commented on a KUNA question about the resentment 
of South Korean oil-consuming companies from a Kuwaiti demand to 
increase the prices by $2 per tonne for the contracts of the 
second part of 1994. He said the issue of prices was among the 
issues open for discussion in connection with any commodity and 
at any time "as long as we have not violated the condition if 
there was an agreement between us and any other side. It is our 
right to offer our commodity at the price we think suitable, and 
it is the right of any side to buy or refrain from buying this 
commodity." 
  He pointed out that "for us, the issue of prices should not 
be interpreted on the basis of making it impossible and 
difficult for them, because this is a commodity on offer, and 
when we are convinced that this is [indistinct word] and this is 
its cost [indistinct words]." 
  In the course of his statement, he pointed out that the 
level 
of (?oil) stockpile in the industrial countries has started to 
decrease in an usual manner, a matter that would lead to 
increases in oil prices. 
  Al-Mid'ij stressed that if the technical and political 
situation of oil continued until next December, there would be 
an increase [indistinct word] in oil prices estimated by two 
dollars. [passage omitted] 
  He dealt with the penalties which any of the OPEC member 
countries could face if they did not adhere to their quotas. He 
pointed out that this would take the form of sending messages to 
the countries violating this agreement, in addition to 
subjecting their oil quotas to deductions in the near future.

  [Excerpts] Brothers, this evening another strong voice is 
being raised from an important corner of the immortal town of 
Tripoli, the Tripoli of Arabs. This voice is being raised today 
from Qirgarish, Hay al-Andalus, and Ghawt al-Sha'al. This voice

have decided to accept the challenge of confrontation and 
defiance, and they have decided to confront defiance with their 
iron and formidable determination which cannot be defeated or 
swayed. 
  Brothers, let your voice rise from the western corner of 
Tripoli, from Qirgarish, Hay al-Andalus, and Ghawt al-Sha'aal. 
Let the enemies hear this strong voice which cannot be 
terrorized by threats and unjust policies. This voice, 
brothers, will terrorize and shake them; the voice of the masses 
and the voice of the free citizen -- the ordinary citizen -- the 
voice of the street and the voice of quarters. [passage omitted] 
  Dear brothers, they use dirty weapons against us so as to 
weaken our determination and we find ourselves forced to give in 
to their wishes. They use economic and psychological weapons 
and threaten us to step up the sanctions. They threaten us with 
an oil embargo. This is an insult to the Libyan people when they 
think that oil is more valuable than the dignity of the Libyan 
people. They are mistaken and they insult the Libyan people 
when they think that oil is dearer than the dignity, glory, and 
our fathers and ancestors' blood which was shed before the time 
of oil in defense of the freedom of this land. They insult you, 
brothers, they think that eating, to you, is more important than 
the homeland. They want to tell you that your are guided by you 
stomach not by you brains. They want to imply that you have no 
dignity when they threaten to embargo the Libyan oil. 
  First of all those barbarians use the dirtiest and the most 
decadent weapons, they fight people in their quest to earn a 
living. Why do they not say they would impose an embargo on 
Libyan dates, onions, or oranges. 
  They say we will impose an embargo on Libyan oil if Libya 
does not surrender, because they know that the main source of 
wealth and the main resource of the Libyan people is oil. Hence 
they embarked upon threatening the Libyan people's livelihood. 
This is not the weapon of real men, nor is it the weapon of the 
brave. It is not a human weapon at all. This is the weapon of 
cowards, the weapon of barbarians (?of the jungle), the enemies 
of human rights and the enemies of peoples. 
  The United States, Britain, and France prove that they are 
the most decadent states and the most barbaric and savage states 
when they fight the Iraqi people, the Libyan people, and the 
Cuban people. They fight each country by its source of wealth. 
They fight Cuba by sugar, its main resource. They fight Iraq 
by deprivation of its oil. They fight Libya by threatening that 
they will impose an embargo on its oil. These threats can only 
come from very decadent and barbarous nations. What is this 
despicable talk which is a disgrace to mankind? What is this 
talk of threatening peoples' resources and wealth? 
  When they impose an arms ban on Libya, this is 
understandable. When they impose a ban on transports, this can 
also be understandable. Whether this applies to Libya or any 
other country, if a state needs to be punished, political 
relations with it are severed. This is also understandable and 
acceptable. However, when they threaten to boycott the source 
of wealth of any people, they are sinking very low in decadence 
and they show that they are barbarians and snakes. After that 
they should no longer have the right to talk about humanity, 
freedom, peoples, and human rights. By threatening the peoples' 
wealth and the people's main resource, they lose that right. 
When they decide to starve peoples, they are proving that they 
are more barbaric than Genghiz Khan and Hulagu, more Nazi than 
Hitler, and more fascist than Mussolini. 
  The new Hitler is the United States, Britain, and France. 
The new Mussolini is the United States, Britain, and France. 
The new Hulagu is the United States, Britain, and France. The 
new Genghis Khan is the United States, Britain, and France. 
[passage omitted] 
  Brothers, how do Arab governments continue to adhere to the 
three Western countries' resolution which was fabricated on 
behalf of the Security Council; how do they adhere to refusing 
Libyan planes even during Hajj, although new evidence has come 
to light before the world regarding the so-called Lockerbie case 
which categorically proves that at least the perpetrator was not 
Libya? 
  This new evidence has come as a slap in the face for the 
United States, Britain, and France, and the so-called false 
Security Council. How can they impose sanctions on the Libyan 
people when it has become evident that a number of sides could 
have perpetrated the crime? A number of sides are now in the 
dock. A number of sides are now thought to have blown up 
Lockerbie [as heard]. How can sanctions against the Libyan 
people continue in an obscure and ambiguous case in which the 
accused have become numerous? How can they pick on one of the 
accused and impose sanctions on him? 
  Shame on Arab governments. Shame on the rulers of the Arab 
nation. Shame on you for carrying out whatever Washington tells 
you without question and for carrying out what Tel Aviv tells 
you without question. 
  It is a disgrace that the issue of Arab existence and Arab 
Palestine has become an issue of the demarcation of borders 
between Jordan and the enemy. Are they not ashamed of the 
thousands of victims -- children and women, not to mention men 
-- of letting the issue of Jerusalem, the issue of Palestine, 
and the issue of threatened Arab existence become the issue of 
the demarcation of borders between Jordan and the so-called 
Israel. 
  This unconditional and unjustifiable surrender is shameful 
and disgraceful. This nation has sacrificed convoys of martyrs 
for Palestine. The sacrifice was not made for the border 
between Jordan and the so-called Israel. [passage omitted] 
  We are telling the colonial countries that the veto has been 
transferred from the Security Council and the superpowers to the 
street, the masses, the Libyan people, the Somali people, and 
the Lebanese people. 
  We are telling them: Do not mock the street, O Arab rulers. 
Do not mock the wretched Arab citizen. Do not pile humiliation 
after humiliation on this citizen. Do not gamble with the 
future of this citizen. This wretched citizen in the Arab 
Maghreb, the Arab Mashreq [Middle East], the Nile valley and the 
Arabian peninsula will take revenge. [passage omitted] 
  We tell them: You should fear the citizen more than the 
United States. You should fear the poor Arab citizen who is 
humiliated today. You should fear him more than you fear 
France, Britain, the United States, and Tel Aviv. O You, the 
servile and submissive Arab leaders, who trade the future of 
this citizen, this citizen will rebel and he must rebel. This 
citizen is a threat to you. America will not save you from this 
citizen. This citizen is closer to you than your jugular vein. 
This citizen is closer to you than rescue from America and Tel 
Aviv. This citizen is lying in wait for you, you the servile 
leaders. 
  Glory is to the street; glory is to the ordinary citizen; 
glory is to these generations which want to live free under the 
sun, away from the United States', Britain's, France's, and Tel 
Aviv's threats. It is this free citizen who will determine what 
he wants. It is he, the free citizen, who should have the right 
of veto. Go on, you colonialists, allying yourselves with the 
most despicable agents and cowards in the Arab region. Go on 
challenging the Arab citizen because this will turn the Arab 
citizen into a bomb. It is this citizen who can do what your 
fleets and nuclear bombs cannot do. We welcome this policy 
which fosters hatred in our children and grandchildren against 
you the colonialists. Go on you the colonialists, go on with 
your devious and mistaken policies from which you will reap 
regret. You will regret this, you colonialists. 
  We are happy when you despise the Arab citizen and when you 
fill this Arab citizen with hatred and rancor against you. Let 
there be more challenge from America to the Arab citizen, the 
Iraqi citizen, the Libyan citizen and the Somali citizen. Let 
there be more humiliation to the Palestinian Arab citizen. Let 
there be more destruction of Lebanon because all this will 
generate hatred and bombs and will generate fear, brothers. 
This will generate terrorism, the real terrorism which they 
fear, when the Arab citizen terrorizes them. This is the 
citizen whose house is being destroyed in Lebanon and about whom 
nobody talks. This citizen will take his revenge, as will the 
citizen who is being jailed in Palestine and who is tortured in 
Palestine and whose mother and sister are tortured in front of 
him. This is the citizen who will turn into a bomb which will 
destroy what is known as Israel. Israel will (?suffer at the 
hands of) this citizen and what is known as Israel will be 
finished; and America's fleets will not save it from the 
ordinary citizen, the explosive citizen wearing an explosive 
belt or carrying a bomb. 
  Continue, you leaders, on the path of surrender and 
submissiveness to the will of the enemy because this will 
shorten your life and will bring your end nearer at the hands of 
the citizen who rejects surrender, submissiveness, and 
servility. The peoples want to live free, brothers. The 
citizen wants to be master of his own destiny and wants to live 
free. He does not accept always living under the leaders' whip 
and under the threats of the enemies, Tel Aviv and Washington. 
God did not create us to live, generation after generation, 
under America's and Tel Aviv's terrorism. 
  We accept death and challenge. We have decided to confront 
the challenge with challenge. We have decided to accept the 
challenge in the spheres of oil, arms, the economy, or in 
anything else. 
  We do not sell the martyrs' blood for oil. We do not sell 
the immortal past for oil. [passage omitted] 
  When the confrontation became a confrontation between the 
citizen and the enemies, between the peoples and the colonialist 
[word indistinct], the confrontation became one between the Arab 
citizen and his rulers, between the citizen and the rulers. It 
is here that the master citizen emerged, the free citizen 
emerged in the free street on the free Libyan territory. He 
emerged today in the western corner of the city of Tripoli, in 
Qirgarish and Hay al- Andalus to make his voice heard by the 
subservient rulers. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Tripoli, 22 Jun (JANA) -- AL-ZAHF AL-AKHDAR, 
published here today, stressed that many of the hidden aspects 
of the so-called Lockerbie issue have begun to emerge, revealing 
a number of those painful facts with which the peoples of the 
world of delusion in capitalist society live, deceived by dozens 
of false capitalist slogans. 
  In a lengthy article today AL-ZAHF AL-AKHDAR said that the 
so-called Lockerbie incident was from the outset a dirty plan of 
the intelligence agencies which was set up with the specific aim 
of preoccupying Western public opinion with marginal issues and 
distracting it from the harsh and bitter crises which they 
experience in their daily life. [passage omitted] 
  AL-ZAHF AL-AKHDAR concluded at the end of its commentary 
that 
Lockerbie revealed that Western governments do not respect the 
public opinion of our society and do not value those who 
represent bodies, organizations, and humanitarian and legal 
organs, and that Western governments trade with their peoples 
and use them as a means of achieving their own aims. The 
Western governments proved that they are backward, malicious, 
and racist toward the peoples of the world and its small states 
and that they do not rely on moral values in dealing with 
international issues and crises.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a comprehensive review 
of all items in the 17 June issue of the Arabic-language 
newspaper Cairo AL-SHA'B that pertain to political Islamic 
issues. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Writer on Mistreatment of Detainees 
  2. Jailed Journalist Honored 
  3. U.S. Policy on Islamic Movements Viewed 
  4. Muslim Brotherhood Writer Interviewed 
<H5>  WRITER ON MISTREATMENT OF DETAINEES </H5>
  A 2000-word commentary by 'Adil Husayn entitled "What Kind 
of 
Dialogue Is This if Opposition Members Can Be Hauled Off to 
Abu-Za'bal Prison at Will?" appears on page 7. Questioning the 
government's seriousness in seeking political dialogue, Husayn 
bolsters his arguments by recounting instances of abuse of 
political detainees. 
  Husayn writes: "I do not believe the government is serious 
about national dialogue. If it was serious, why did it have to 
delay it for seven months?" He adds: "Circumstances forced the 
government to propose dialogue with other political parties, but 
`backsliding' has marked its position on that issue for the past 
few months." 
  Following a few opening paragraphs, Husayn dedicates the 
remainder of the commentary to a detailed description of the 
suffering of the "political detainees" held in Abu-Za'bal 
Industrial Prison [sijn abu-za'bal al-sina'i]. The following 
account of abuse was reported to him by an eyewitness, 
'Abd-al-Nasir Fahmi 'Abd-al-'Al, an engineer from al-Minya who 
"describes what he experienced and saw in this prison in which 
2,500 Egyptian youths are held." 
  The suffering of the detainees, Husayn discloses, begins 
with 
the first moment of their incarceration: "The detainee's 
experience in this prison begins with the `gauntlet,' or `the 
welcoming beating.' Officers, NCO's, and detectives gather as 
the detainees are made to face the wall. They slap, punch, and 
cane the detainees, the latter having been made to strip 
completely. The detainee is beaten on every part of his body. 
Sometimes a stick is inserted in his anus. The process is 
accompanied by a good measure of name-calling. Every detainee 
is ordered to slap the one next to him or place his finger in 
his anus. They are also forced to dance and sing obscene songs." 
  Husayn then describes conditions of overcrowding and lack of 
hygiene in the prison. He concludes the article with a call on 
the interior minister and public attorney to respond to the 
above-mentioned allegations: "We demand a statement from the 
interior minister about this crime. We consider this article a 
request for investigation by the public attorney. We call on 
all democratic forces to object. Yes, we call for 
investigation, but, first of all, for an end to this crime." 
<H5>  JAILED JOURNALIST HONORED </H5>
  A 1,000-word report by 'Abd-al-Rahman Isma'il on page seven 
describes a ceremony held at the Journalists Association on 16 
June in which the Egyptian Human Rights Association gave its 
"Opinion and Expression Award" to 'Abd-al-Sattar Husayn, 
AL-SHA'B's military correspondent, who is serving a prison 
sentence in Masra'at Turah prison for publishing "military 
news." The award was given to show "solidarity with his cause. 
He has been subjected to the worst possible human rights 
violations as a price for speaking his mind." 
<H5>  U.S. POLICY ON ISLAMIC MOVEMENTS VIEWED </H5>
  Muhammad Jamal 'Arafah explores U.S. policy toward Islamic 
movements in a 1,800-word commentary on page 8 entitled: 
"Interest Is the Sole Criterion: Has America Agreed To 
Cooperate With Islamic Movements in the World?" 
  'Arafah begins by stating his conclusion: "It seems that the 
U.S. Administration is about to formulate its attitude toward 
Islamic movements in the world in general and the Arab region in 
particular on the basis of one criterion, its interests and 
influence." 
  To substantiate this view, the writer cites articles from 
NEWSWEEK, THE WASHINGTON POST, FOREIGN AFFAIRS, and LOS ANGELES 
TIMES, all containing a conciliatory tone toward the Islamists 
or pointing to a softening of the U.S. stand toward Islamic 
movements. 
  'Arafah then articulates his view of a self-serving United 
States ready to accommodate Islamic movements to protect its 
global position: "It is clear that the new U.S. tendency to seek 
the involvement--not containment--of Islamists in the political 
process in some countries--such as Algeria--aims to serve U.S. 
supreme interests. The tendency, sugarcoated with such slogans 
as `human rights' and `spreading democracy worldwide,' is 
symptomatic of a United States determined to hedge its bets 
against a possible rise of the Islamists to power." 
  The United States may still change its mind, however. The 
new phenomenon, 'Arafah tells us, "does not seem more than a 
change in temporary U.S. `tactics' rather than a shift in 
`strategy.'" 
  To assess the durability of the new U.S. attitude, 'Arafah 
has in mind to apply an litmus test: "The real test of the 
veracity of the new U.S. tendency is to see if it will ever 
filter through to countries other than Algeria. If the Americans 
extend their call for the participation of Islamists [in 
government] to their traditional allies--Egypt and Tunis, among 
others--then the new attitude is real, albeit self-serving." 
<H5>  MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD LEADER INTERVIEWED </H5>
  A 2,000-word interview with Muslim Brotherhood leader Hamid 
Abu-al-Nasir by Sha'ban 'Abd-al-Rahman, for which the place and 
date are not given, appears on page 9. Abu-al-Nasr reiterates 
objectives of his organization, saying that it is committed to 
democracy and shuns violence.

<F P=106> [From the "Political Week" section] </F>
  [Text] A new Islamist organization calling itself the 
"Caliphate Group" has recently appeared. The organization, 
which espouses the concept of repudiation and accuses all 
existing Islamic societies and countries of apostasy, is 
operating in tribal territories adjacent to the Pakistani-Afghan 
border. It advocates the restoration of the caliphate under the 
leadership of the group's chief. The membership of the new 
organization comprises Egyptian, Sudanese, Jordanian, and 
Algerian nationals. The leader of the group is an Arab 
millionaire of Palestinian extraction called Abu-'Uthman. He 
considers himself an extension of Shukri Mustafa, leader of the 
Repudation and Renunciation group. 
  Last week the Pakistani authorities asked the group's 
leading 
members to leave Pakistan.

  [Text] Tunis, June 24 (AFP) -- A north Yemeni parliamentary 
delegation, seeking support for north Yemen's campaign against 
southern secessionists, met here Thursday [23 June] with PLO 
Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, official sources said. 
  The Palestine Liberation Organization leader stressed the 
need to "continue efforts to reach a just solution that takes 
into account the interests of the Yemeni people," the 
Palestinian news agency WAFA reported. 
  The Yemeni delegation, which also met with Tunisian 
parliamentary leaders and members of legal opposition groups, 
accused Saudi Arabia of supplying arms to southern forces, 
according to diplomatic forces. 
  Civil war erupted in Yemen on May 5 in the midst of a 
political dispute between northern and southern leaders on the 
administration of the country. The south proclaimed itself a 
separate state on May 21. 
  Southern representatives are also touring north Africa. A 
spokesman for the breakaway Yemen Democratic Republic earlier 
Thursday appealed to the international community to "impose a 
ceasefire by force." 
  The Tunisian government has expressed concern at the 
deteriorating situation in Yemen but has not taken sides in the 
conflict.

  [Text] Brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat], state of 
Palestine president and PLO Executive Committee chairman, has 
issued instructions to set up committees to run municipal 
affairs in every city and village in the West Bank expected to 
come under the control of the Palestinian National Authority in 
the next few months, in accordance with the Oslo and Cairo 
agreements. 
  News reports cite a Palestinian source as saying that before 
his expected arrival in the occupied territories in July, 
Brother President Abu-'Ammar wants to resolve several matters 
which are considered remnants of the Israeli occupation, 
particularly the issue of municipalities, which are estimated at 
100 big and middle- sized municipalities, as well as 250 village 
councils. 
  The source added that Brother President Abu-'Ammar, who 
believes these municipalities and councils will have a basic 
role to play in the development process, and even in the 
political process, has given instructions to a number of 
specialized committees, set up during meetings of the 
Palestinian leadership, to contact qualified people to establish 
such committees.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-Jabbar al-Barghuthi] </F>
  [Text] Tunis -- Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat has 
condemned the Israeli policy, based on procrastination and 
foot-dragging, concerning the prisoners and their right to 
breath the air of freedom and live among their families and near 
their children, who have been waiting for them impatiently. He 
called on Rabin's government to honor its obligations by 
completing the release of prisoners in Israeli jails, without 
discrimination or vacillation, and granting them the right to 
live with honor and dignity in any place they wish without being 
forced to go to this or that area inside the one homeland. 
  'Arafat affirmed his clear response to the Israeli notion 
which is trying to put controversial issues on hold under the 
pretext of "the final stage solution." He considered Jerusalem 
to be an urgent issue whose final status should be discussed as 
soon as possible, as stipulated by the Oslo accord despite its 
bias. 
  'Arafat said: Our position on the issue of settlements must 
be one of isolation. We should not create any opportunity for 
coexistence with the settlements or accept them. They 
contravene international resolutions and laws and were built, 
from the start, on a false basis. 
  'Arafat said: It was not appropriate to refer to the 
settlements in the economic agreement despite the fact that the 
Israeli authorities receive 100 percent of the taxes deducted 
from Palestinian workers in these settlements. We do not want 
the settlements to remain and do not encourage work in them 
under any inducement. 
  'Arafat assured the Palestinian people that the 
establishment 
of an independent Palestinian state, with holy Jerusalem as its 
capital, was inevitable regardless of the statements or the 
climate propagated by Israeli extremists. 
  'Arafat affirmed that the aspired for state, for which our 
people have always dreamed and struggled with their most 
precious possessions, will belong to all Palestinians wherever 
they may reside. In this state, they can develop their national 
and cultural identity and enjoy full and equal rights. Their 
religious and political beliefs and human dignity will be upheld 
within framework of a democratic parliamentary system based on 
freedom of opinion, freedom to establish parties, protection of 
the minority's rights by the majority, and the minority's 
respect for the majority's decisions. 
  'Arafat added that this system will also be based on social 
justice, equality, and no discrimination toward universal rights 
on the basis of race, religion, color, or between male and 
female. This, within framework of a constitution that ensures 
the sovereignty of law and an independent judiciary and on the 
basis of effective loyalty to the Palestinian spiritual and 
cultural heritage of tolerance and smooth coexistence among 
religions throughout centuries.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Faysal al-Husayni by Karmit Gay </F>
and Moti Amir; place not given -- live] 
  [Text] [Gay] Mr. al-Husayni, Yasir 'Arafat is constantly 
raising new demands and conditions for his arrival. It looks as 
though he is in no hurry to arrive. 
  [Al-Husayni] Look, the issue here is not new conditions. 
If we are talking about real peace; if Mr. Rabin has decided to 
make peace with the person who issued the orders to wage a 
struggle against Israel; if Yasir 'Arafat, in turn, is making 
peace with Rabin, who also issued orders of such a nature, then 
I believe those who carried out these orders must not remain in 
prison. We, too, must close all the cases against Israelis 
rather than say that Israelis who killed Palestinians must be 
dealt with. 
  [Gay] That is a different issue. I want to ask you, 
however, why 'Arafat constantly postpones his arrival here? 
What does this have to do with other issues? After all, he can 
continue the negotiations from his office in Jericho. 
  [Al-Husayni] Look, there is no point in 'Arafat coming here 
and acting as though real peace is on its way, while at the same 
time prisoners remain incarcerated for no reason. I do not 
understand why there are still prisoners and why no female 
prisoner has been released so far. We can see that whenever the 
Palestinians carry out a new move, the Israelis evince an 
inflexible attitude regarding the prisoners issue. The Israelis 
must tell us clearly whether they do not want to release the 
prisoners or how long it will take. We want to understand this. 
  [Amir] Mr. al-Husayni, the negotiations over the release of 
prisoners will take several months. The issue of international 
observers will also take months to be resolved. This means that 
'Arafat will in fact arrive only when the entire West Bank is 
under Palestinian self-rule. 
  [Al-Husayni] Not exactly. I must tell you, however, that 
Yasir 'Arafat cannot come under the present conditions. When 
Nabil Sha'th came to Jericho, he was forced to wait for several 
hours near al-'Awja' and several more hours near the bridge. If 
such issues are not resolved, 'Arafat will not be able to come. 
When he comes, he will come as a generally recognized national 
leader. I do not know how the Israelis intend to deal with 
Yasir 'Arafat when he arrives. If these issues are not 
resolved, I do not believe he can come. 
  [Amir] Is it true that Dr. Sha'th recommended that 'Arafat 
delay his arrival in Jericho because of what happened to Sha'th 
in Jericho or because his request to visit Jerusalem was refused? 
  [Al-Husayni] No, no. What I am saying is that every day we 
see something new which proves to us that the Israelis are not 
honoring the spirit of the agreement. Nabil Sha'th said he 
wanted to make a private visit to Jerusalem to meet friends. 
Once he said this, everything was done to prevent the visit, 
and he was also harassed in Jericho. If 'Arafat comes to 
Jericho and says something some Israelis do not like, then he 
will be punished by not being allowed to travel to Gaza until he 
writes letters and waits several days. We do not understand and 
cannot accept such a situation. 
  [Gay] This morning the prime minister is convening a meeting 
regarding the PLO's attempts to create political facts in 
Jerusalem. Apparently, the prime minister does not want to 
legislate laws regarding this issue but to deal with each 
attempt separately. What do you think about this? 
  [Al-Husayni] Look, every day there are new Israeli buildings 
in Jerusalem; every day more Israelis come to live in East 
Jerusalem. In the past, the Palestinians constituted 100 
percent of the residents of East Jerusalem; now they constitute 
less than 50 percent. We are not allowed to build houses. 
Houses built because of the housing shortage in East Jerusalem 
are being demolished. Now the Israelis come and say that it is 
the Palestinians who are trying to create new facts in 
Jerusalem. All we are asking for is to live normally in 
Jerusalem. 
  [Gay] Do you not want to turn Orient House into the 
Palestinian government building? 
  [Al-Husayni] Who said that Orient House has become the 
Palestinian government? From its inception, Orient House has 
been totally dedicated to the issue of peace. We have still not 
completed the peace process. Once it is completed, we will see 
what to do with Orient House, but until then, it will continue 
to fulfill its mission. You know very well that the issue of 
Jerusalem has still not been ironed out. The negotiations on 
this issue are supposed to start within the next two years. So 
why should you seek to determine the Jerusalem issue now? You 
should wait until the negotiations start. Perhaps Israel is in 
fact implying that there are no negotiations and that the 
agreement was only meant to hold the Palestinians back while 
Israel does whatever it must to finalize everything and leave 
nothing for the negotiations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mahmud 'Abbas, member of the PLO Executive </F>
Committee, by Khalil Abied in Tunis; date not given: "`We Have 
To Get Back as Quickly as Possible'"] 
  [Text] [Abied] Yasir 'Arafat has declared that he will 
not go to the autonomous regions as long as the international 
community holds back funds that have already been promised. The 
financiers say that the PLO has failed to establish the 
institutions required for administering the funds. 
Palestinians, on the other hand, maintain that the funds are 
being used to put pressure on them. What is the truth? 
  ['Abbas] The Palestinian authorities have to return as 
quickly as possible. That will be the touchstone for the 
financiers. Once we are in the Gaza Strip and in Jericho, we 
will be able to say: Here are our institutions, now, please give 
us the money you promised. We will not give them any pretext 
for blocking the money. 
  [Abied] The experiences of the past few months have not been 
very encouraging. The talks between the Israelis and the 
Palestinians were delayed. 
  ['Abbas] Both sides have wasted a lot of time. Now the 
Palestinian authorities must quickly assume their tasks and 
tackle the enormous economic and social problems. And we should 
not forget that there are further negotiations to be held with 
Israel on the handing over of authorities and the return of 
refugees. 
  [Abied] Why do you not want to take part in the autonomy 
administration? Are you annoyed? 
  ['Abbas] The fact that I was successful in the Oslo talks 
does not mean that I have to assume part of the power in the 
autonomous regions. The construction of the Palestinian regions 
needs young, qualified people. I do not think that I am 
suitable for a ministerial office. 
  [Abied] Does this mean that the existing `revolutionary' 
institutions of the PLO and the 'revolutionaries' they contain 
are not in a position to cope with the future stages? 
  ['Abbas] I doubt whether they are up to the complicated 
challenges. For establishing a school, constructing roads, or 
working out a development plan we need experts that have a 
different mentality. It is not shameful for a revolutionary to 
admit that he cannot build a state. 
  [Abied] Do the other Palestinian leaders share this view? 
  ['Abbas] Many of my comrades-in-arms have refused to 
participate in the new Palestinian authorities because they hold 
similar views. And several of the new "ministers" have been 
quite reluctant to accept their nomination. 
  [Abied] You said that there will be a Palestinian state 
within two years. What makes you so optimistic? 
  ['Abbas] Until the secret talks were held in Oslo it was 
taboo for the Israelis to negotiate with the PLO. For them we 
were terrorists. Today there are lively contacts between the 
two sides, and there is increasing support in the Israeli 
society for the idea of a Palestinian state. For the Israelis, 
the most important thing is their security. That is why much 
will depend on the capability of the Palestinian authorities to 
safeguard this. If the Israelis get the feeling that a 
Palestinian state does not threaten them, they will accept it. 
  [Abied] Is this not prevented by the Palestinian opposition, 
especially the Islamic Hamas? 
  ['Abbas] There are two oppositions. The Syria-based 
`Alliance of the Ten Organizations' and the opposition in the 
occupied territories. The first makes a lot of noise, but it 
does not have any influence. The latter is pragmatic. We have 
told them: Why should we destroy the possibility of self-rule 
with our own hands? In a few months' time there will be 
elections in the autonomous regions. If the majority of 
Palestinians speak out against the forces of peace and in favor 
of those who want to continue the struggle, then we will respect 
this decision.

  [Excerpts] In the file of the Middle East, the PLO is still 
exerting efforts with Western countries for obtaining financial 
aid, and at the same time prepares itself for a new round of 
talks with Israel which will most certainly be held in Cairo. 
Nabila Khraifia: 
  [Khraifia] [passage omitted] President 'Arafat sent Abu 
al-'Ala [Ahmad Quray], economy minister in the Palestinian 
authority, to Washington to ask for urgent financial aid to 
ensure the running of the self-rule institutions. 
  That was announced in Tunis by a Palestinian official who 
refused to reveal his identity. He also pointed out that the 
lack of money was the main reason for postponing President 
'Arafat's trip to the self-rule areas and the installment of the 
Palestinian government in Jericho. 
  The same source pointed out that the donor countries had 
proposed to offer the PLO last week $ 10 million dollar of the $ 
24 million which they promised on 10 June last, and had raised 
it to $18 million dollar after President Yasir 'Arafat had 
rejected it.

body was found in Bayt Lahiyah in northern Gaza, are currently

  [Text] For the first time, Palestinian forces in the 
autonomous zones have arrested four murder suspects and turned 
them over to Israel Police. The four, arrested by police in 
Jericho, are suspected of the brutal murder of a young 
Palestinian woman, Fatima 'Abd-al-Hamid, from the village of 
Baytuniya, near Ramallah. The suspects, from the al-Jalazun 
refugee camp, escaped to Jericho and, at the request of Israel 
Police, were extradited.

  [Text] Damascus (SANA) -- The working class has renewed its 
pledge of loyalty, commitment, and allegiance to President Hafiz 
al- Asad on the occasion of holding the fourth session of the 
General Council of the General Federation of Workers Union. The 
cable says: 
  The General Council of the General Federation of Workers 
Union meeting in its fourth session renews to you the pledge of 
loyalty, affection, and commitment which our working class has 
believed in and considered a firm course for its struggle, which 
depends on your generous offers and directives and adheres to 
the national and pan-Arab constants which you have affirmed and 
which have been entrenched in our national march and productive 
process so that Syria under your leadership will be the pioneer 
of struggle for liberating the occupied Arab territory, 
restoring usurped rights, and preserving Arab solidarity as the 
course for mobilizing Arab potentials in face of the challenges 
threatening the present and future of the Arab nation. 
  Our General Council held deep discussions on the recent Arab 
and international developments and their repercussions on our 
people and working class and was in close touch with the 
successive events. It affirmed its adherence to rights under 
all circumstances and its readiness for all the proposed 
possibilities for achieving a just and comprehensive solution 
without abandoning or conceding any inch of the occupied 
territory. We recall your words that there is not a single 
house in Syria which has not lost a martyr in defense of the 
homeland, the nation, and Arab rights. For the sake of these 
martyrs and their sons and families we want the peace of the 
brave; a real, viable peace which will last and guarantee 
everyone's interests and give everyone his rights. 
  We pledge to interpret your words into action and creative 
initiative in the field production and services and to improve 
the standard of our trade union performance in the work sites 
and in all fields in order to overcome existing hardships. Our 
working class and its trade unionist organizations are loyal and 
committed to the course which has been chosen by our party and 
National Progressive Front under your wise leadership in order 
to protect national gains and achievements, develop national 
production in all fields, and safeguard the great generous offer 
[wage increase] which you granted the sons and daughters of the 
working class on their world labor day. 
  Our workers will remain loyal soldiers committed to the 
national and pan-Arab march under your wise and courageous 
leadership until the achievement of our nation's objectives of 
unity, freedom, and socialism.

  [Text] Foreign Affairs Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri, who 
has been in Washington since last Monday [20 June] on a working 
visit to the United States, has reviewed Algeria's domestic and 
foreign policies to the Arab and international media in the 
American capital. 
  We review Dembri's activities in Washington in the following 
report by Bechir Hedebel: 
  [Hedebel] On the third day of his visit to Washington 
Foreign 
Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri held talks with members of the 
U.S. Senate before going to a lunch banquet held in his honor at 
the foreign relations council. 
  The meeting gave Mr. Dembri the opportunity to explain the 
current efforts aimed at widening the national dialogue and the 
outcome of his talks with the American officials, in addition to 
the economic reforms in Algeria, particularly those concerning 
the transformation to a market economy. 
  During his meeting with Arab press representatives in 
Washington yesterday evening, Dembri expressed hopes of 
achieving better means for Arab consultations in view of the 
disarray noted in the Yemeni conflict, recalling the efforts 
made by Zeroual, the head of the state, to contain the crisis 
since its start by receiving Yemeni envoys or in his telephone 
calls and the telegrams he sent to the two parties, in which he 
warned them against the danger of resorting to arms. 
  During his meeting with the Arab journalists, the minister 
also focused on the current rapprochement of the national 
dialogue and the search for consensus. In this respect, he said 
that a frank exchange of views had taken place with the American 
officials, which was not in any means an interference in 
Algerian internal affairs. 
  On the issue of the Western Sahara, the minister pointed out 
the international commitments included in the UN peace plan, 
making it clear that Algeria would try, as much as possible, to 
help to achieve a political settlement between the two parties 
to the conflict within the framework of direct dialogue between 
Morocco and the Polisario Front. 
  In his assessment of the various talks, Dembri pointed out 
that the United States stressed its support for the economic and 
political reforms taking place in Algeria.

  [Excerpt] National Highway One between In Salah and 
Tamanrasset was the scene of a series of armed attacks during 
the last few months. The attacks were carried out by gangs 
against trucks belonging to the National Road Haulage Company. 
Faced with such a situation the lorries of the aforementioned 
company did not have any other solution but to cut short their 
journey at In Salah, thus starving the region from being 
supplied with most commodities. 
  In an attempt to contain the situation, the local 
authorities 
at Tamanrasset have taken a number of security measures.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a comprehensive review 
of all items in the 17 June issue of the Arabic-language 
newspaper Cairo AL-SHA'B that pertain to political Islamic 
issues. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Writer on Mistreatment of Detainees 
  2. Jailed Journalist Honored 
  3. U.S. Policy on Islamic Movements Viewed 
  4. Muslim Brotherhood Writer Interviewed 
<H5>  WRITER ON MISTREATMENT OF DETAINEES </H5>
  A 2000-word commentary by 'Adil Husayn entitled "What Kind 
of 
Dialogue Is This if Opposition Members Can Be Hauled Off to 
Abu-Za'bal Prison at Will?" appears on page 7. Questioning the 
government's seriousness in seeking political dialogue, Husayn 
bolsters his arguments by recounting instances of abuse of 
political detainees. 
  Husayn writes: "I do not believe the government is serious 
about national dialogue. If it was serious, why did it have to 
delay it for seven months?" He adds: "Circumstances forced the 
government to propose dialogue with other political parties, but 
`backsliding' has marked its position on that issue for the past 
few months." 
  Following a few opening paragraphs, Husayn dedicates the 
remainder of the commentary to a detailed description of the 
suffering of the "political detainees" held in Abu-Za'bal 
Industrial Prison [sijn abu-za'bal al-sina'i]. The following 
account of abuse was reported to him by an eyewitness, 
'Abd-al-Nasir Fahmi 'Abd-al-'Al, an engineer from al-Minya who 
"describes what he experienced and saw in this prison in which 
2,500 Egyptian youths are held." 
  The suffering of the detainees, Husayn discloses, begins 
with 
the first moment of their incarceration: "The detainee's 
experience in this prison begins with the `gauntlet,' or `the 
welcoming beating.' Officers, NCO's, and detectives gather as 
the detainees are made to face the wall. They slap, punch, and 
cane the detainees, the latter having been made to strip 
completely. The detainee is beaten on every part of his body. 
Sometimes a stick is inserted in his anus. The process is 
accompanied by a good measure of name-calling. Every detainee 
is ordered to slap the one next to him or place his finger in 
his anus. They are also forced to dance and sing obscene songs." 
  Husayn then describes conditions of overcrowding and lack of 
hygiene in the prison. He concludes the article with a call on 
the interior minister and public attorney to respond to the 
above-mentioned allegations: "We demand a statement from the 
interior minister about this crime. We consider this article a 
request for investigation by the public attorney. We call on 
all democratic forces to object. Yes, we call for 
investigation, but, first of all, for an end to this crime." 
<H5>  JAILED JOURNALIST HONORED </H5>
  A 1,000-word report by 'Abd-al-Rahman Isma'il on page seven 
describes a ceremony held at the Journalists Association on 16 
June in which the Egyptian Human Rights Association gave its 
"Opinion and Expression Award" to 'Abd-al-Sattar Husayn, 
AL-SHA'B's military correspondent, who is serving a prison 
sentence in Masra'at Turah prison for publishing "military 
news." The award was given to show "solidarity with his cause. 
He has been subjected to the worst possible human rights 
violations as a price for speaking his mind." 
<H5>  U.S. POLICY ON ISLAMIC MOVEMENTS VIEWED </H5>
  Muhammad Jamal 'Arafah explores U.S. policy toward Islamic 
movements in a 1,800-word commentary on page 8 entitled: 
"Interest Is the Sole Criterion: Has America Agreed To 
Cooperate With Islamic Movements in the World?" 
  'Arafah begins by stating his conclusion: "It seems that the 
U.S. Administration is about to formulate its attitude toward 
Islamic movements in the world in general and the Arab region in 
particular on the basis of one criterion, its interests and 
influence." 
  To substantiate this view, the writer cites articles from 
NEWSWEEK, THE WASHINGTON POST, FOREIGN AFFAIRS, and LOS ANGELES 
TIMES, all containing a conciliatory tone toward the Islamists 
or pointing to a softening of the U.S. stand toward Islamic 
movements. 
  'Arafah then articulates his view of a self-serving United 
States ready to accommodate Islamic movements to protect its 
global position: "It is clear that the new U.S. tendency to seek 
the involvement--not containment--of Islamists in the political 
process in some countries--such as Algeria--aims to serve U.S. 
supreme interests. The tendency, sugarcoated with such slogans 
as `human rights' and `spreading democracy worldwide,' is 
symptomatic of a United States determined to hedge its bets 
against a possible rise of the Islamists to power." 
  The United States may still change its mind, however. The 
new phenomenon, 'Arafah tells us, "does not seem more than a 
change in temporary U.S. `tactics' rather than a shift in 
`strategy.'" 
  To assess the durability of the new U.S. attitude, 'Arafah 
has in mind to apply an litmus test: "The real test of the 
veracity of the new U.S. tendency is to see if it will ever 
filter through to countries other than Algeria. If the Americans 
extend their call for the participation of Islamists [in 
government] to their traditional allies--Egypt and Tunis, among 
others--then the new attitude is real, albeit self-serving." 
<H5>  MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD LEADER INTERVIEWED </H5>
  A 2,000-word interview with Muslim Brotherhood leader Hamid 
Abu-al-Nasir by Sha'ban 'Abd-al-Rahman, for which the place and 
date are not given, appears on page 9. Abu-al-Nasr reiterates 
objectives of his organization, saying that it is committed to 
democracy and shuns violence.

<F P=106> [From the "Political Week" section] </F>
  [Text] A new Islamist organization calling itself the 
"Caliphate Group" has recently appeared. The organization, 
which espouses the concept of repudiation and accuses all 
existing Islamic societies and countries of apostasy, is 
operating in tribal territories adjacent to the Pakistani-Afghan 
border. It advocates the restoration of the caliphate under the 
leadership of the group's chief. The membership of the new 
organization comprises Egyptian, Sudanese, Jordanian, and 
Algerian nationals. The leader of the group is an Arab 
millionaire of Palestinian extraction called Abu-'Uthman. He 
considers himself an extension of Shukri Mustafa, leader of the 
Repudation and Renunciation group. 
  Last week the Pakistani authorities asked the group's 
leading 
members to leave Pakistan.

<F P=106> ["Standpoint" column by Hadi Tu'mah: "The Separatists and </F>
This Cheap Lying"] 
  [Text] Since their condemned separatist movement, the 
renegades in Yemen have been making false accusations against 
Iraq whenever their subversive movement's link with the Saudi 
and Gulf rulers has been exposed, their military situation has 
become critical, and their resistance has weakened before the 
advance of the unionist legitimacy. 
  The last of these exposed lies is the claim about the arrest 
of five Iraqi pilots who, in fact, are teachers of fine arts and 
physical education. Iraqi and Yemeni departments have documents 
proving they are nothing more than teachers. 
  It is clear from the course of events that this absurd claim 
coincided with the successive defeats of the separatists and the 
emergence of a suspect role spearheaded by Riyadh on behalf of 
Washington against the Arab nation and its legitimate 
advancement. This confirms the deep involvement of the 
separatist clique in the hostile plan of Washington and Zionism 
to undermine Arab will and the source of its strength. It also 
confirms the failure of the agent clique's suspect plot. 
  If these are some of the reasons for the separatist clique's 
resort to the fabrication of lies against Iraq, the other reason 
is the clean Arab stand Iraq has adopted in support of 
legitimacy and the unity state, which is a result of the will of 
the Yemeni people and all their political parties, including 
that of the separatists themselves. Another reason is the mean 
and trivial attempt of the separatists to exploit the anomalous 
political attitude toward Iraq, due to the mean conspiratorial 
role played by the clique of Gulf rulers, the odious attempt on 
Yemeni legitimacy, and the attempt to carry out a reactionary 
movement embodied by the condemned secession. This imposed Gulf 
stand has been condemned by the unionists of southern Yemen, 
headed by Muhammad Basandwah. 
  No sooner had the subject of Saudi military intervention 
been 
exposed, especially by the Yemeni legitimacy forces' seizure of 
80 tanks, than the separatists made up the lie about the arrest 
of five Iraqis, and Saudi television showed pictures of these 
Iraqis. The Saudi regime and its overlords know better. These 
Iraqis are just teachers. 
  This method of making false accusations and instigations, 
despite the aforementioned facts, confirms the miserable 
political and moral bankruptcy of the clique of separatists and 
those standing behind them. It also acquits Iraq of any charges.

is a pan-Arab accomplishment that has been made through huge 
sacrifices.

Arab nation in its confrontation of the evil, hostile, and 
reactionary forces threatening the nation's present and future.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Barzani's Party Denies Negotiation </F>
with Baghdad"] 
  [Text] London, AL-HAYAH -- The unified Kurdistan 
Democratic Party [KDP], led by Mas'ud Barzani, has affirmed that 
it "has no intention of holding secret negotiations with 
Baghdad. If it became convinced that negotiations would serve 
the interests and aims of our people then it would hold 
negotiations openly as it had done in the negotiations with 
successive Iraqi governments." It emphasized that it "saw no 
point in negotiating with the regime." 
  A statement by the KDP's spokesman, which AL-HAYAH received 
yesterday, said that the report published by AL-HAYAH on Tuesday 
under the headline "Barzani resumed negotiations with Baghdad" 
was "unfounded" and that the report was "leaked for selfish 
partisan and political purposes by a party to the recent 
dispute" in Iraqi Kurdistan "with the aim of casting doubt on 
the KDP's position in the Iraqi opposition." 
  The statement added: "That is confirmed by the fact that the 
KDP has obtained a Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK] secret 
internal bulletin number 24, dated 19 June 1994, containing the 
same information published in AL-HAYAH's report. That source 
was the only source, referred to as reliable Kurdish Iraqi 
sources. We do not believe that such practices would help the 
current peace process and reconciliation in Iraqi Kurdistan 
following the containment of the destructive crisis. 
  "To clarify the truth we also say that the members of the 
KDP's alleged delegation which was supposed to include Yunis 
Ruzbayani and 'Izzat Sulayman Bik and to have visited Baghdad on 
11 and 12 June, actually never left the Kurdish area at all in 
that period. In addition to being a member of the Central 
Committee, Ruzbayani is also the interior minister in the 
regional government and he was in his office in Irbil during 
that period as many employees can testify. As for 'Izzat 
Sulayman, he was grieved when his son Aram was killed in the 
recent fighting, and he never left the area in that period 
because of the tragedy and the condolences procedures. No other 
official went to Baghdad. The unified KDP has no intention of 
holding secret negotiations with Baghdad. If it became 
convinced that negotiations would serve the interests and aims 
of our people then it would hold them openly as it has done with 
successive Iraqi governments, but the party sees no point in 
negotiation with the regime and it is committed to the policy 
and objectives of the Unified Iraqi National Congress, which 
are: promoting a democratic alternative and fulfilling the 
Kurdish people's aspiration to a federation within a peaceful, 
united, and democratic Iraq."

  [Text] The Kurdistan Democratic Party [KDP] has reaffirmed 
that the Iraqi Kurds are standing in one line against the forces 
of evil and aggression in defense of the unity, dignity, and 
independence of great Iraq under President leader Saddam Husayn. 
  This came in a statement issued by the party at the end of 
an 
ordinary meeting held today. The meeting was devoted to 
discussing the situation in Iraqi Kurdistan and the tragic 
events there as a result of the bloody armed clashes between the 
traitors and agents belonging to the humiliated Barzani and 
Talabani as well as the ongoing events in fraternal Yemen whose 
national unity is threatened with secession and apostasy. 
  In its statement, the party emphasized that despite all the 
imperialist conspiracies and intrigues and the mean 30-state 
aggression as well as the subsequent traitorous and treacherous 
chapters--which have continued incessantly in the form of the 
continued blockade on the Iraqi people's Arabs, Kurds, and other 
fraternal nationalities--the Iraqi people, by virtue of their 
steadfastness and endurance, have managed to foil all forms, 
links, and chapters of the conspiracy and preserve their 
national unity with their heads high behind the banner of God is 
Great. This banner is carried with all vigor and loftiness by 
the unique President leader Saddam Husayn. 
  In the statement, the party said that such traitors and 
agents as Barzani and Talabani are symbols of agentry and crime. 
The forces of the U.S.-Zionist evil and aggression deputized 
these agents to implement a subversive and criminal conspiracy 
against the Iraqi people after they failed to achieve their 
objectives during the brutal 30-state aggression and its 
successive chapters with the aim of isolating Iraqi Kurdistan 
from Iraq, the mother homeland. These forces also lured these 
agents into giving them a free hand in the region and fulfilling 
their sick dreams at the expense of the struggle, blood, and 
martyrs of the Iraqi Kurds who continue to be a true sword 
defending the unity of both lofty Iraq and its people as part of 
a unique autonomy. No Kurds in any world state have been 
granted such autonomy. 
  The statement also pointed to the risks posed by the 
continued unfair blockade imposed on the Iraqi people. This 
blockade has gravely harmed the Kurds, exactly like other 
nationalities in Iraq., This harm threatens death as a result of 
the scarce food and medications in addition to the serious 
situation the Iraqi Kurds are experiencing due to the ongoing 
bloody fighting between the symbols of agentry; namely, the 
Talabani and Barzani groups [words indistinct] tens of Iraqi 
Kurds everyday. 
  With regard to the ongoing events in fraternal Yemen, the 
KDP 
stressed the need to halt all forms of foreign interference in 
Yemen's internal affairs. The party described this interference 
as a grand conspiracy which is targeting Yemen's unity and which 
is not less heinous than the brutal 30-state aggression on the 
Iraqi people. The party renewed its support for the just 
legitimate and constitutional struggle which the fraternal 
Yemeni people are waging in defense of their national and 
historic unity against the secessionist and renegade forces.

  [Text] Mosque imams in Baghdad and the governorates have 
called on Muslims all over the world to uphold the Islamic faith 
and to close their ranks in order to confront the enemies' 
rancorous plans, which seek to undermine our Islamic religion 
and divide Muslims into small states in order to usurp their 
wealth and national will and dominate their destiny and future. 
  The imams affirmed in their Friday sermons yesterday that, 
God willing, victory will be for justice represented by the 
heroic Iraqi confrontation and steadfastness against the mean 
aims and interests of the forces of evil, infidelity, deception, 
and aggression headed by the United States. 
  The imams praised leader President Saddam Husayn's generous 
offers that increased the wages of civil servants and low-income 
people and his orders to oblige grocers to ensure the supply of 
food for the people and to strike at greedy horders. 
  The imams prayed to God almighty to preserve Iraq, its 
people, and struggler leader President Saddam Husayn, to 
strengthen the march of reconstruction and faith in God and the 
homeland, and to support the president against his unjust 
enemies.

<F P=106> ["From the Guidance of Islam" column by Shaykh </F>
'Abd-al-Ghaffar al-'Abbasi: "The Faith Campaign Sought by the 
Leader Needs Care and Following Up"] 
  [Excerpts] Religious upbringing is important, because 
religion is basic to the life of the individual and society. 
[passage omitted] 
  The faith campaign [al-hamlah al-imaniyah], whose positive 
results have been felt by our upright leader President Saddam 
Husayn, shows the leader president thinks highly of the faith 
issue, which is represented by the call to follow the teachings 
of the Holy Koran, not just repeat them. The Koranic courses, 
which will be held for children in mosques during the Summer 
holidays, will consist of the true thought which came in the 
revelation to Prophet Muhammad, may the peace and blessings of 
God be upon him. The call of faith has come in response to the 
revelation's aims of bringing up children according to the 
teachings of the Koran. This call has come at the right time, 
when the nation is facing the revelation's enemies, the enemies 
of justice and the people. The leader's ambitions will be 
achieved by the preachers in the field. The Koranic sessions 
are only one aspect of bringing up children according to the 
teachings of the Koran. Therefore, we appeal to guardians to 
urge their children to respond to this luminous call, which the 
leader and God's faithful servant Saddam Husayn has adopted and 
advocated in order to bring up a faithful generation that will 
love God, the homeland, and the leader through the sublime 
principles they will learn from the Holy Book they will read. 
This will prepare them to resist the evils of the enemies. 
When the young generation is strong by its faith and its 
struggle for the sake of principles, the enemies will retreat. 
This is the state we are all struggling for so the plots will 
backfire on the enemies. As the leader president said: We are 
gaining the youths in order to guarantee the future. [passage

  [Text] In the presence of Dr. 'Abd-al-Mun'im Ahmad Salih, 
minister of awqaf and religious affairs, and under the slogan: 
"The Church in the Service of Peace and Humanity" a symposium 
organized by the Church of Iraq, represented by all of its 
communities, began in Iraq on 11 June. It will continue until 
14 June 1994. In his opening speech, Dr. Salih conveyed the 
greetings of the faithful struggler leader Saddam Husayn and his 
wishes for the success of the symposium. 
  Dr. Salih said: We are pleased and honored that Baghdad is 
hosting your world Christian symposium, which is one of the 
fruits of religious tolerance and the fraternity of the faithful 
from the religions that uphold this fraternity, as exemplified 
by Iraq under the patronage of the faithful struggler leader 
Saddam Husayn. You will personally experience the care and 
attention given to the various religious communities in Iraq, 
the atmosphere of piety that guarantees freedom of worship and 
performance of religious rituals, and the financial support 
given to places of worship and their various institutions. 
  Dr. Salih added: Iraqis are all equal on the basis of faith 
and monotheism. The leader president said: "The most important 
achievement, after winning almighty's God pleasure, is the 
feeling that Iraqis are all equal on the basis of faith and 
monotheism. Other than that, everyone is free to follow the line 
and course he and his fathers and forefathers have chosen. 
Iraqis respect each other's choice, while firmly holding to 
their faith. Our main role is to preach faith." [passage 
omitted] 
  Patriarch Raffaele Bidawid I, head of the Chaldean community 
in Iraq and the world, delivered a speech in which he expressed 
his pleasure at the arrival of world delegations representing 
the various church councils in the world to participate in the 
symposium. The patriarch said that for more than three years 
Iraq has faced an unjust blockade which has led to the death of 
thousands of infants and pregnant women. 
  Archbishop Michael Fitzgerald, representative of Pope John 
II 
and secretary of the Council of Dialogue Among Religions, 
delivered a speech in which he expressed his thanks to leader 
President Saddam Husayn for Iraq's hosting of this world 
symposium and inviting the Vatican to participate in it. The 
archbishop said: I am pleased to convey the greetings of His 
Holiness the Pope John II and his wishes for the success of this 
symposium as well as his concern for the sufferings of the Iraqi 
people and his desire for the establishment of peace and justice 
in the region. 
  The representative of Pope Shunudah, head of the Coptic 
Church in Egypt, delivered a speech on behalf of the delegations 
taking part in the symposium in which he condemned the 
continuation of the blockade imposed on Iraq and its brave 
people. 
  Afterward, Patriarch Mar Adi, head of the Assyrian Community 
in Iraq, delivered the speech of the preparatory committee for 
the symposium. He praised the support and care given to the 
various religious communities in Iraq by leader President Saddam 
Husayn and his excellency's concern about guaranteeing religious 
freedom for all communities so they can live in peace and 
harmony. Patriarch Mar Adi said: The continuation of the 
blockade is an unpardonable crime and a violation of all 
heavenly values and international laws and norms. [passage

Humanity has concluded its work. The symposium, which was 
attended by Dr. 'Abd-al-Mun'im Ahmad Salih, minister of awqaf 
and religious affairs and several ulema and Muslim and Sabian

Security 
Council, heads of state, archbishopric councils, and world 
church councils to exert their utmost effort in order to remove 
the injustice on the people of Iraq, the cradle of civilization, 
which has offered a great to the world in the fields of science 
and art. They also appealed to those in charge of the world news 
media not to condone the blackout on the injustices and 
tragedies taking place in Iraq and other countries. They 
expressed their confidence that the good forces in the world 
will cooperate with them in restoring the legitimate rights of 
Iraq and its people and all other countries so peace, security, 
and wellbeing will prevail.

the world.

<F P=106> [Report by Nizar Daw-al-Na'im and Kamal Hamid: "Sudan: Ummah </F>
Party Threatens To Resort to Armed Action"] 
  [Excerpts] London, Khartoum -- The Sudanese opposition 
Ummah Party warned yesterday that it will resort to armed action 
against President 'Umar al-Bashir's regime if the party's 
leader, former prime minister al-Sadiq al-Mahdi, and two of the 
party's other leaders arrested on charges of planning to carry 
out bombings and political assassination are subjected to 
"violence" or if "the regime resorts to bloody [physical] 
liquidation." The party stressed that it "it has not taken any 
decision to resort to military action and it is still committed 
to a peaceful solution. However, it is leaving the door open to 
the option of replying to aggression." 
  In a press conference they held in London yesterday, 
attended 
by some leaders of the other parties who stressed their parties' 
solidarity and condemned al-Mahdi's arrest, Ummah Party leaders 
said that "the Ummah Party's principled position is against 
assassinations and bombings, which the Sudanese scene has never 
witnessed before and which conflicts with Sudanese ethics." 
  Mubarak al-Fadil al-Mahdi, head of the party's Executive 
Bureau and official in charge of external action, said: "We 
chose political struggle as a means to oppose that military 
regime without seeking to shed blood or request foreign 
intervention. Historically, we resorted to armed struggle 
against aggression twice: once against colonialism and once 
against (former President Ja'far) Numayri after he destroyed the 
strongholds of Ansar al-Mahdi [followers of Imam al-Mahdi] and 
killed their imam." He said: "While we adhere to the peaceful 
struggle option, we keep our other options open. And if the 
ruling (National Islamic) Front resorts to violence and to 
bloody liquidation and opens the door of aggression, our party 
will leave the door open to the resumption of armed action." 
[passage omitted] 
  Dr. 'Umar Nur-al-Da'im, secretary general of the Ummah 
Party, 
also spoke at the conference, stressing that "the political and 
economic crises the regime is experiencing, as well as the 
crises in its relations with the world, prompted the fabrication 
of accusations against the party's leaders. The fabrication of 
this kind of theatrical ploy is characteristic of military 
regimes, because they are based on conspiracy and have no 
legitimacy." He said that al-Bashir's regime "has been 
tyrannical for five years and lacks constitutional legitimacy, 
as it has done the opposite of what it promised in its first 
statement." 
  He pointed out that "the rejection of the regime has begun 
to 
increase while popular and regional support for it has declined, 
and there is now a general belief that the regime is about to 
collapse." 
  He said that the recent accusations against al-Mahdi are 
made 
"because he managed to set up a leadership for the Democratic 
National Grouping inside the country and to establish strong 
opposition committed to civil resistance." He added that 
"al-Mahdi insists on this line despite the the great pressures 
put on him to engage in an armed battle with the regime." He 
said that the Ummah Party does not want a military 
confrontation, "because the loser will be the people of Sudan 
and those representing them, not the small (Islamic) Front 
organization." He said that an armed confrontation would mean 
turning Sudan into a situation similar to the one Rwanda is 
currently experiencing. 
  He believes that leveling accusations at the Ummah Party "is 
a trick designed to avoid the scandals that the defendants being 
tried in the Ansar al-Sunnah Mosque massacre case could reveal." 
  He stressed that "the political and economic siege, 
corruption, the regime's isolation, and international 
condemnations of it have caused the regime to behave 
hysterically. And we will confront the Front if it persists in 
its behavior. We are optimistic that the regime is about to 
collapse, and its actions will change nothing in the situation. 
We are against violence and have not yet decided on the armed 
action option. But if physical liquidations begin, we will have 
to reply to that aggression." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by Nahum </F>
Barne'a at Rabin's office in Jerusalem on 23 June] 
  [Text] [Barne'a] Mr. Prime Minister, will you invite 
'Arafat to visit Jerusalem? 
  [Rabin] Jerusalem should remain united, under Israeli 
sovereignty, and Israel's capital. I consider this issue to be 
of primary importance in view of the permanent solution. At the 
same time, I consider it our primary duty to allow freedom of 
worship and free access to the Muslim and Christian holy sites. 
I believe it is impossible to insist on Jerusalem's being 
united and Israel's capital without allowing free access to the 
followers of other religions. 
  If tomorrow al-Qadhdhafi should ask to make a pilgrimage to 
Jerusalem to pray at the holy sites, I would consider this a 
positive development. 
  There is one restriction: the security consideration. Being 
a Muslim, 'Arafat is entitled to visit Jerusalem, just like any 
other Muslim. If he wishes to pray, that would be his right. 
There would be a problem of timing and arrangements, but in 
principle our reply would be positive. To me, this stems from 
the commitment undertaken by every Israeli Government, including 
the current one, to allow free access to the holy sites. 
  [Barne'a] Are you concerned by the statements Jerusalem 
Mayor Ehud Olmert has made in this regard? 
  [Rabin] I am surprised at the Jerusalem mayor, if he is 
indeed involved in the various things that have been reported. 
Anyone who says he would prevent a Muslim from praying in 
Jerusalem -- be it al-Qadhdhafi, the Saudi king, President 
al-Asad, or 'Arafat -- is causing damage to Israel. I consider 
this a Jewish and an Israeli obligation. 
  [Barne'a] You do not invite Olmert to take part in 
discussions about Jerusalem. 
  [Rabin] One discussion -- an internal discussion -- was held 
at my place with defense and legal officials, and it was not 
about the 'Arafat visit. We discussed ways to make sure that 
what was stipulated in the Gaza and Jericho agreement -- that 
all the bodies connected with the Palestinian Authority are to 
be located in Gaza or Jericho -- is observed and that no 
authoritative body of the Palestinian Authority is located in 
Jerusalem. 
  [Barne'a] Nabil Sha'th's visit here ended with what seemed 
to him like a humiliation: You did not allow him to visit 
Jerusalem. Was this done deliberately? 
  [Rabin] We recommended that on his first visit, he focus 
more on civilian matters, which today are not running as 
smoothly as the police and other security forces. We 
recommended that he not deal with symbolic matters. At the same 
time, I see no reason to prevent him from visiting Jerusalem, 
whether for religious reasons or to meet with friends. There 
was an understanding between him and the deputy chief of staff 
that the visit not take place at this time. In the future, 
everything is open. 
  I believe that the extreme right wing's attempts to portray 
such visits as casting doubt over Israel's sovereignty over 
Jerusalem are a grave mistake. In doing so, the right is in 
fact showing that it is nervous and uncertain that we are indeed 
sovereign in Jerusalem. We are both the majority and sovereign. 
As Jews, we should treat others as we expect to be treated in 
places where we are not sovereign. 
  [Barne'a] The Israeli right is active with regard to the 
Golan Heights issue as well. As you well know, Israel is 
currently engaged in a struggle in Washington against the 
presentation of an amendment at the U.S. Senate that would ban 
the administration from sending U.S. troops to the Golan. 
  [Rabin] I believe this is simply silly. This is a twisted 
misrepresentation of the facts by the Israeli and U.S. Jewish 
right wing. The man who thought up the idea of placing a U.S. 
force here was Menahem Begin, and I want to give him credit for 
this. The attempt to intimidate the American people by drawing 
a similarity between Somalia or Vietnam and supervising the 
implementation of military clauses in a peace treaty is stupid. 
Their hatred for the government, their wish to place obstacles 
on the way to peace, has driven the extreme right mad. 
  [Barne'a] Are we on the verge of launching secret talks with 
Syria? 
  [Rabin] Unfortunately, not yet. The Syrian attitude is 
wrong. They are conducting the negotiations under the assumption 
that the United States should deliver Israel to them and bring 
about the signing of a peace agreement on Syrian terms. This is 
not the United States' intention; neither is it conceivable that 
we would agree to this. 
  I believe that Warren Christopher will pay another visit in 
July. I hope the Syrians will come to their senses and realize 
that the time has come for a direct dialogue. 
  [Barne'a] Have you and Peres agreed that he will take over 
the negotiations with the Syrians? 
  [Rabin] The negotiations will continue in their current 
form. It is only natural for the foreign minister to be a full 
partner. He is doing his job as foreign minister. 
  [Barne'a] On 19 June, after the stormy meeting in Bet Berl 
[in which Rabin and Labor Central Committee members exchanged 
accusations over the failure in the Histadrut elections], you 
held a secret, lengthy, late night meeting with Peres. Can you 
say that nothing has changed in Peres' status after the meeting? 
  [Rabin] I will not comment on private meetings. I will not 
go into details. 
  [Barne'a] But you are not denying that something has 
changed? 
  [Rabin] We mainly discussed the current situation in the 
party as well as in the country. We hold private meetings 
frequently. It is quite natural. 
  [Barne'a] These meetings are always required when one of you 
returns from abroad.... 
  [Rabin] You said that. 
  [Barne'a] King Husayn met with President Clinton on 22 June. 
It seems that the meetings follow a pattern: Husayn says he 
wants peace very much, and then, when the President utters a 
kind word, everything vanishes. 
  [Rabin] We have reached an agreement with Jordan that the 
talks between us will be moved from Washington to our region. 
This is in line with our concept that it is better to hold 
separate, bilateral talks and not talk to all the partners at 
the same time. The location of the talks has not been determined 
yet. 
  It is clear to me that Syria does not view the progress with 
Jordan positively. I even heard that Syria complained to the 
Americans that they lent a hand to breaking the joint framework. 
  [Barne'a] Does Husayn want to start with an agreement on 
borders? 
  [Rabin] There will be no peace if the borderline is not 
determined. This will come in addition to normalization, the 
establishment of ties, security arrangements, and so on. The 
problem with Jordan is relatively less complex. We will start 
by discussing everything; we will conclude nothing before we 
attain a peace treaty. 
  [Barne'a] After he met with you on 21 June, Hayim 
Haberfeld, the Histadrut labor federation secretary general, 
looked very happy. This seems a bit odd, after you called on 
him on 19 June to draw the necessary conclusions and go home. 
  [Rabin] We suffered a blow in the Histadrut elections. 
There is no point in hiding it. We decided to accept the 
voters' verdict. Ramon and his list will head the Histadrut. We 
want to be their partners, not their tail end. The Histadrut 
conference will be held on 5 July. Ramon will be elected 
secretary general on the same or the following day. 
  [Barne'a] Ramon says he cannot work with Haberfeld. Can you 
understand this? 
  [Rabin] I do not accept disqualifying people on a personal 
basis. I believe that Ramon's demand, anchored in such 
disqualification, is out of place. I am familiar with many 
historical examples of politicians who said they could not work 
together. In a democracy, one has to accept the majority's 
decision, but the man who came in second should also learn how 
to live with the results. Rivalries may exist before elections 
take place. After they are held, conclusions must be drawn. 
  [Barne'a] Were you Ramon, would you go hand in hand with 
Haberfeld? 
  [Rabin] If you look for love, do not turn to politics to 
find it. 
  [Barne'a] A recently published poll shows Ramon is more 
popular than you are. What do you think about this? 
  [Rabin] The Knesset elections were held exactly two years 
ago. I believe that the fact that I headed the list contributed 
to our victory. I also believe that we are fulfilling that 
which the government pledged in its guidelines. I want the 
public to judge me at the end of my four-year term. I am not 
affected by last week's or last month's polls. We have two more 
years. The yardstick by which to measure my success will be the 
government's achievements. 
  [Barne'a] Will you run again in 1996? 
  [Rabin] Presently, I am busy with implementing government 
policy. You may take your guesses as to what I will do in two 
years, but I will not make the announcement today. It would not 
be good for Labor. 
  [Barne'a] Sarid and Ramon said they will run for the 
premiership in 1996 only if you do not. Are you pleased with 
such statements? 
  [Rabin] I do not concern myself with such statements at this 
time. We are halfway through our term. 
  [Barne'a] You said that 1994 will be the year of peace. It 
does not seem like you will sign another agreement in 1994. 
  [Rabin] I believe that the implementation of the Gaza and 
Jericho agreement creates a good atmosphere for peace. It would 
be a positive thing if the process with Jordan developed, and I 
still see a chance for a dialogue with Syria. On our part, we 
will work to reach a breakthrough this year, and if not in 1994, 
then in 1995. 
  [Barne'a] That would be the year before the elections. 
  [Rabin] I do not believe the elections will make a 
difference. 
  [Barne'a] Hayim Ramon believes that parties are 
disappearing, that today a leader does not need a party to reach 
the voters. Do you also feel that Israel's party system has 
become superfluous? 
  [Rabin] Whether we will legislate direct elections or 
continue to vote according to the old system, today in Israel 
the vote is cast for the "who" as well as the "what." The 
"what" is expressed by the party. I do not believe the era of 
parties is over. I believe there is room for adjustments. 
Today, the media is the people's main source of information. 
You reach more people through it than through any party 
conference. At the same time, parties are needed; a nucleus of 
men is needed. 
  [Barne'a] Then why do you hate them so much? 
  [Rabin] I never said I hate them. 
  [Barne'a] It was very interesting to watch you at the party 
Central Committee meeting on 19 June. Whenever you see the 
committee members, something burns inside you, does it not? 
  [Rabin] Not true. I believe the time has come to build 
these institutions in a different manner. For example, I am not 
sure that primaries should apply in all cases. Those directly 
elected by the public -- a prime minister, a city mayor -- 
should be elected through primaries. The situation of Knesset 
members, however, who are not directly elected, is different. 
They are not elected directly at this time. To a large extent, 
they are elected thanks to the man who heads the list. There is 
room to examine canceling primaries for Knesset members. 
  [Barne'a] A lot has been said about your style, about the 
expressions you use. On the other hand, many on the street like 
it. Is it calculated? 
  [Rabin] As prime minister I am the target for expressions of 
support and a primary target of attacks. If you do not 
understand this, do not be a prime minister. I say what I 
think. Sometimes, I want to make a point by using harsh terms. 
  [Barne'a] Is it deliberate? 
  [Rabin] Certainly. 
  [Barne'a] Speaking on 19 June, were you absolutely cool? 
  [Rabin] It was calculated. I was convinced that committee 
members, many of whom work for the Histadrut, feel that their 
source of income is being threatened. This is a humanitarian 
problem, and I hope we will find a solution for it. At the same 
time, contrary to what they shouted there, I do not believe that 
the government governs while the Histadrut serves as its soul. 
With all due respect for the Histadrut, the soul is the state, 
the future of the people of Israel. I had to put things in 
proportion. 
  [Barne'a] Do you plan to replace ministers in your 
government, what is called a political reshuffle? 
  [Rabin] I do not reshuffle. You must remember that most of 
the ministers were not ministers in the past. There are stages 
for assuming a post. I believe it is my duty to back them up. 
Let each go on in his field and stand corrected if necessary. 
This is not a mutual admiration society. 
  [Barne'a] You seem more comfortable with men in uniform, 
whom you have deeply involved in the negotiations. 
  [Rabin] My decision to bring in IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
officers was based on essential needs. First priority was given 
to personal security. This entailed dealing with the details. 
I saw it vital for those who are tasked with implementing the 
agreement to be involved with its fine details. They did not 
make the political decisions. I was attacked for not involving 
military men in the secret negotiations in Oslo, and at the same 
time the opposite charge was leveled at me. I believe my 
decision was correct. 
  The chief of staff, his deputy and the regional command 
commanders performed excellently. I am happy that IDF soldiers 
no longer cruise Gaza. There was a drop in the number of riots 
and terror attacks in Gaza, for now. In Judaea and Samaria, 
where we are in control, the drop was very slight. 
  [Barne'a] Are you concerned with regard to the expected 26 
June publication of the report by the mission of inquiry into 
the Hebron massacre? 
  [Rabin] I am sure we will receive no compliments. An 
appalling incident took place: A loathsome Jewish murderer shot 
worshipers in the back in a holy place. There is no doubt that 
law enforcement on extremist Jews in the territories or those 
who joined them was far from being perfect. 
  [Barne'a] Did the establishment you are heading draw lessons 
from the incident? 
  [Rabin] Not enough. The problem is more complex. I saw the 
negative reactions to my decision to place several Jewish 
extremists under administrative detention. Even the Human 
Rights Association was opposed. I could at the same time place 
hundreds of Palestinians or more under administrative detention 
and no one would have said a word. 
  Large segments of the public have cultivated a forgiving 
attitude toward the extreme right in the territories. Our 
judiciary has also not treated them with the utmost severity 
stipulated by law, and not quickly enough. There are cases that 
have not come to trial for three to four years. The entire 
method of law enforcement on Jews in the territories requires a 
thorough reexamination. 
  [Barne'a] Do you watch the world soccer championship games? 
  [Rabin] Yes, when I get home from work at night. 
  [Barne'a] What did you see so far? 
  [Rabin] Naturally, I saw the opening game. I saw the 
Bulgaria-Nigeria and Switzerland-Romania games. I could not 
always find the time to see all the games. I enjoy it very 
much. This is how I enjoy myself and rejuvenate from not always 
pleasurable things.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin hopes that the Syrians 
will understand that if one seeks to promote the peace 
negotiations, there is almost no recourse but to open direct 
talks with Israeli leaders. However, as long as they continued 
to refuse to do so, Israel must use the good services of the 
United States. 
  The prime minister added he hoped that the secretary of 
state 
would visit the region in the middle of July. We must be 
convinced that we have done absolutely all we could to make 
progress and exhaust every opportunity to make peace with Syria, 
Yitzhaq Rabin said, noting however that such efforts should not 
be made under any conditions nor at any price. The prime 
minister was speaking at a ceremony at the president's residence. 
  Reacting to the criticism that was leveled against the 
statements he made yesterday regarding an Israeli withdrawal 
from the Golan Heights, the prime minister asserted that those 
who failed to keep even one thousandth of the Sinai Peninsula in 
exchange for peace had no right to put on an angry face and 
brazenly state that one could achieve peace in exchange for 
peace. That was total nonsense, Rabin said. 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1600 GMT on 23 June in a 
similar report adds that "Israel was to a large extent 
responsible whether the Middle East would move in the direction 
of peace and calm or toward violence and war. As for the 
proposals delivered to the Syrians, Rabin said that they 
pertained to the bilateral nature of the relations between the 
two countries. In the meantime, however, the gap between the 
parties' positions remained the same."] 
  Foreign Minister Peres said that if the Syrians open the 
negotiations to meetings at higher levels and on additional 
tracks, then significant progress could be made. The foreign 
minister was speaking at a meeting with EU ambassadors in 
Israel. As for the agreement with the Palestinians, Peres said 
that its implementation was going smoothly and the Palestinians 
were organizing themselves in the field from all aspects. The 
foreign minister noted that Israel was preparing itself for the 
implementation of the second stage of the agreements.

<F P=106> [Report by Ron Ben-Yishay] </F>
  [Excerpts] PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat is insisting that the 
IDF [Israel Defense Forces] withdraw from major Judaea and 
Samaria population centers in the near future, even before 
autonomy is applied to these areas. 
  The demand, which was officially relayed to the prime 
minister's bureau about two weeks ago, is based on what 
Palestinian sources term "an oral understanding and the spirit 
of the Oslo agreement." 
  A senior government element has confirmed that the PLO did 
indeed present such a demand to Israel, although he denied that 
"either an oral or written pledge was given to 'Arafat on this 
matter." 
  Senior IDF commanders advised the prime minister to reject 
the demand on the grounds that the IDF troops' exit from major 
Judaea and Samaria cities before comprehensive security 
arrangements for Palestinian self-rule are established would 
jeopardize the lives of Israeli civilians. Those in danger will 
be mainly residents of settlements in the vicinity of Ramallah, 
Nabulus, Hebron, Qalqilyah, and Tulkarm, some of whom have to 
drive through these cities' centers on their way to the 
settlements. 
  'Arafat relayed this new demand to Jerusalem via his adviser 
Nabil Sha'th, who handed it to Major General Amnon Shahaq during 
a meeting at Erez checkpoint last week. [passage omitted] 
  Palestinian sources claim that a high-ranking Israeli 
element, whose identity they refused to disclose, promised 
'Arafat that rather than wait for sweeping redeployment in the 
West Bank on the eve of the autonomy council elections, the IDF 
would withdraw from city centers shortly after the completion of 
the evacuation from Gaza and the Jericho enclave. 'Arafat is 
now demanding that the IDF evacuate the centers of major cities 
and hand over control in the evacuated areas to the Palestinian 
police force in the framework of the next stage of the 
establishment of Palestinian self-rule -- the stage of early 
empowerment, during which the Civil Administration's powers in 
the territories are to be handed over to the PLO, as agreed in 
Oslo. 
  Senior defense establishment elements recently advised the 
prime minister not to hurry to implement the next stages 
stipulated in the Oslo Declaration of Principles before he is 
certain the Palestinians have adhered to their Cairo agreement 
commitments with regard to Gaza and Jericho. That was the 
reason they recommended he reject 'Arafat's demand for early IDF 
withdrawal from city centers. [passage omitted] 
  Defense establishment elements also recommended that the IDF 
redeployment be put off until negotiations on comprehensive 
security arrangements in the Palestinian self-rule in Judaea and 
Samaria are completed. The IDF also has reservations about the 
early transfer of Civil Administration powers to the 
Palestinians. Senior elements argue that early empowerment will 
only create confusion and undesirable friction between the still 
active Civil Administration and the Palestinian authorities due 
to take over from the Civil Administration.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Nasir-al-Din al-Nashashibi, "King </F>
Husayn's adviser," by Arab affairs correspondent Avraham Barne'a 
at al-Nashashibi's East Jerusalem home on 23 June -- 
Al-Nashashibi's remarks in English] 
  [Text] A meeting between King Husayn and Prime Minister 
Rabin may take place much before October. This remark was made 
today by Nasir-al-Din al-Nashashibi, a close adviser to King 
Husayn in the West Bank. The senior Jordanian journalist, 
Sultan al-Hattab, who was in Israel last week and met Rabin and 
Peres, was sent here by Jordan's prime minister and stayed in 
al-Nashashibi's East Jerusalem home. Speaking with our Arab 
affairs correspondent Aharon Barne'a today, al-Nashashibi 
explained what lies behind the recent moves by the king: 
  [Begin recording] [Al-Nashashibi] When Jordan found that 
Syria has not moved enough towards peace -- and under certain 
pressure from the United States and from the world opinion on 
Jordan to act for peace, and under certain pressure, financial 
and economic pressure, also pressure from the army side for more 
new arms -- so, these things made Jordan fasten [as heard] its 
steps towards peace. 
  [Barne'a] Nasir-al-Din al-Nashashibi, today a close adviser 
to King Husayn, served as an adviser to the king's grandfather, 
King 'Abdallah, just as he was an adviser to Jamal 
'Abd-al-Nasir, King Fahd, and other Arab leaders. Today, he 
believes, Husayn is past the stage of being angry over being 
left out of the picture, and decided to take the initiative and 
lead, as did his grandfather. 
  [Al-Nashashibi] He has been always a man who leads. And, as 
I said, since 1948, his grandfather was a man of peace. He paid 
his life as a price for that peace, and the king is aware of 
this. 
  [Barne'a, in English] Are we to witness very soon a meeting 
between the king, or high Jordanian officials, and high Israeli 
officials? 
  [Al-Nashashibi] I think the king has no complexes. He 
will... [pauses] I heard yesterday that a future planned public 
meeting would take place in October. I doubt it. It will take 
place before -- if the king feels that the bell is ringing 
across the river and there are certain good, just, comprehensive 
offers that he can transfer into concrete peace agreement. [end

<F P=106> [Report by Gabi Zohar] </F>
  [Text] The way the Palestinian police has managed to take 
control over security in the Gaza Strip and Jericho is "not 
bad," but the civilian institutions are still at the beginning 
of being formed. This was stated yesterday by Major General 
Dani Rothschild, coordinator of government activities in the 
territories, at a seminary on the political economy of peace in 
the Middle East, held at Haifa University yesterday. 
  Rothschild explained that Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] 
and the Islamic Jihad are not interested in holding a dialogue 
with Israel. "At best, they consider taking part in the 
Palestinian establishment, but they are opposed to the peace 
process. 
  "Should they become part of the Palestinian autonomy, this 
will not happen as part of a democratic process in which a 
society votes and makes democratic decisions. This could lead 
to problems, if Hamas wins a majority in the Palestinian 
autonomy. Israel is trying to help with a money-equivalent and 
today employs 25,000 Palestinians from the autonomy. Work in 
Israel is not granted automatically -- it is a consequence of 
the security situation and economic needs. 
  "The number of Palestinian laborers permitted to work in 
Israel is occasionally considered with regard to these two 
criteria. If in the future we will see that the Palestinian 
police and security forces are managing to take control over the 
self-government regions and keep them quiet, we will further 
increase the number of Palestinian laborers in Israel." Gen. 
Rothschild noted that the standard of living in Gaza and Jericho 
has deteriorated since Israel pulled out from there. 
Nevertheless, it will take a few months before these things can 
be statistically examined. 
  "At the same time, I am optimistic and I do not believe that 
a financial or economic problem can foil the agreement. It 
seems to me that the Palestinian Autonomy is stable enough to 
improve its situation even if the process takes a month or two. 
There will be cause for concern if the Palestinian 
establishment does not show the residents that their standard of 
living is improving. There will be no vacuum in this place. If 
the situation does not improve, Islamic forces that oppose the 
peace process will step in. 
  Gen. Rothschild estimated that the economic situation will 
improve in Gaza and Jericho within the coming two weeks, after 
the donor countries last week agreed to transfer $42 million to 
the autonomy. Contacts between the Palestinian body, set up to 
coordinate the transfer of money from the EU, and the European 
donor countries will continue next month. The money that will 
arrive in two weeks will provide for immediate needs, and the 
funds that will arrive later are earmarked for various projects. 
  "The Palestinian self-government authorities should make a 
list of priorities for the donors. You cannot pay for the 
construction of houses before an infrastructure and a sewage 
system is built, and the donor countries do not know that," 
Rothschild said. He added: "One of the donor countries' foreign 
ministers told me recently: We will provide for 5,000 houses. 
When I asked him: what about schools and infrastructure? he 
said: `It is their problem.'" 
  Referring to the Palestinian aspiration to cut themselves 
off 
from Israeli aid at once, Rothschild said that they will have to 
choose which is more important to them: national pride or 
economic needs. The idea to construct a power station on a ship 
at sea only because they do not want to receive electric power 
from Israel is economically wrong. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0600 GMT on 21 June 
reports that "Major General Dani Rothschild, the coordinator of 
government activities in the territories, said that Israeli 
companies tried to take over Palestinian businesses by flooding 
the territories with goods. That is why the Palestinians seek 
to cut themselves off from the Israeli economy. At the same 
time, Rothschild made the assessment that despite all the talk 
about separation from Israel by politicians in the territories, 
Palestinian businessmen and economists would prefer ties with 
the Israeli economy rather than with Jordan. The coordinator 
warned that if the Palestinian authorities did not rapidly 
improve the standard of living in the autonomous areas, the PLO 
may lose control of the streets to radical elements. Israel, 
therefore, must do all in its power to help the PLO."]

  [Text] Over the last four months there has been a sharp 
drop in the number of attacks and disturbances in the Gaza 
Strip, Judaea, and Samaria. This was said today by Chief of 
Staff Ehud Baraq to the Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense 
Committee. Lieutenant General Baraq is not convinced that the 
present situation will continue over the long term. He says we 
must prepare for the possibility that Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] and the rejectionist organizations will increase their 
activity. Our correspondent Tamar Asalem reports from the 
Knesset: 
  [Begin recording] [Asalem] The Knesset Foreign Affairs and 
Defense Committee was today presented with figures pointing to a 
decrease in the number of attacks in Judaea, Samaria, and the 
Gaza Strip, as well as inside the Green Line. During April, 108 
attacks were registered in Judaea and Samaria, compared to 78 in 
May, and 47 in June. The respective figures for the Gaza Strip 
were 120 in April, 48 in May, and 10 in June. In the Green Line 
there were 38 attacks in April, 15 in May, and 5 in June. The 
chief of staff noted this is a significant drop in the level of 
terrorism. He added, however, that we cannot rule out a 
possibility of an increase in the number of attacks in Judaea 
and Samaria, excluding Jericho. 
  [Baraq] I would not build on this decrease over the long 
term. I sincerely hope this situation continues to prevail in 
Gaza and Jericho. We must prepare for the possibility, however, 
that I will be proven wrong and that Hamas and the rejectionist 
organizations will try to increase their activity in Judaea and 
Samaria or inside Israel. 
  [Asalem] Regarding Hamas activity, the chief of staff added 
his impression -- which is based on the Palestinian impression 
-- that Hamas influence in Gaza and Jericho is waning. Perhaps 
this is related to Israel's withdrawal from those areas. The 
Palestinian police have also played a part in this development. 
Baraq added, however, that activity in the mosques continues as 
usual. 
  Asked about extending the autonomy area in future, Baraq 
said 
the issue is still far off on the agreement's agenda. Baraq 
said that Israel's security interest in Judaea and Samaria goes 
beyond safeguarding the settlers and has to do with deployment 
for the event of a war on the eastern front. 
  Lt. Gen. Baraq also spoke about the situation in south 
Lebanon, saying that Israel is doing everything possible to make 
life difficult for Hizballah by dictating terms for it. 
  [Baraq] Over the recent past, since the abduction of al- 
Dirani, the Air Force attack, and other successful operations, 
Hizballah has suffered a series of severe setbacks and lost 
dozens of its fighters, with many dozens being wounded. 
Obviously they continue to seek for ways of retaliation. 
Yesterday they attacked us successfully from their point of 
view, and painfully from ours. We will have to do everything 
possible to prevent the recurrence of such attacks. At the same 
time we must realize that the struggle in the security zone will 
continue. 
  [Asalem] The chief of staff was asked whether Syrian 
involvement in south Lebanon is growing deeper. His answer was 
negative, but he added that in his opinion Syria is pleased with 
every successful Hizballah attack against Israel. [end

<F P=106> [Report by Knesset correspondent Yona Kohen] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres confirmed in the 
Knesset there is room for concern regarding the events in North 
Korea, which is dodging international supervision. 
  Addressing the Knesset plenum, Peres emphasized the need of 
implementing international political steps regarding this issue. 
Peres said the world is changing its shape from a world of 
enemies to a world of dangers. The lethal combination of 
missiles and nuclear weapons has changed the issues of borders, 
defenses, and settlements; it is doubtful whether there is any 
way to prevent the missile danger. Peres said that our defense 
system must meet the magnitude of the missile and nuclear 
weapons danger. 
  Peres added that political agreements can prevent the 
nuclear 
danger. The foreign minister hopes an international coalition 
will be formed against the countries harboring missiles and 
nuclear arms. North Korea is presently playing a "cat and mouse 
game." The United States is heading the countries confronting 
the North Korean threat. Peres said that the United States is 
determined to prevent the danger, adding that Israel will 
support whatever action it takes in this issue.

<F P=106> [Commentary by 'Aqiva Eldar: "Longing for Carter"] </F>
  [Text] It looks as though speaking untruthfully or -- to 
put it more bluntly -- lying has become a plague among 
politicians. This phenomenon has spread far beyond Israel and 
has also affected the U.S. secretary of state and President. 
Before his meeting with King Husayn, Warren Christopher came up 
with an excellent explanation for delaying his Middle East 
visit: He could not have postponed his visit as he never 
planned to visit the region in June to begin with. 
  If the secretary of state was telling the truth, it must be 
stated that all his peace advisers intentionally misled the 
Israeli Embassy in Washington. Even worse, is it conceivable 
that a politician who has committed himself to energetic 
mediation between Israel and Syria should take such a long break 
without planning his next trip to these countries? 
  Some maintained that the eminent politician was forced to 
delay his trip to our region at the last moment because of the 
North Korean crisis. President Clinton said that Jimmy Carter 
visited Pyongyang as a tourist rather than as an official White 
House emissary. A day later, the former president said on 
television, however, that he routinely discusses sensitive 
issues, such as the invitation to visit North Korea, with the 
President. In fact, when President Bush asked Carter not to go 
there, he acquiesced, so it stands to reason that had Clinton 
asked nicely, the former Democratic president would not have 
turned him down. 
  Whom are we to believe: Carter, who promised Kim Il-song and 
CNN that the sanctions have been frozen; or Clinton, who 
announced that the diplomatic effort to consolidate the 
sanctions will continue until President Kim translates his words 
into action? 
  Meanwhile, Kim has won several more weeks to smuggle 
additional quantities of fuel waste for implementing his plan of 
turning North Korea into a nuclear bomb supermarket. Last 
month, Clinton warned that destroying any evidence regarding the 
removal of fuel from the reactor would destroy all chances of 
opening a third round of talks between the United States and 
North Korea. The evidence was destroyed, and Western 
intelligence can only guess the number of nuclear bombs hidden 
in the cellars of one of the most dangerous regimes in the world. 
  Now, after Carter has returned triumphantly from the Korean 
peninsula, Clinton is talking about encouraging signs and hope 
for a new beginning in relations with North Korea. The tension 
regarding the sanctions has evaporated, and Clinton found the 
time to deal with his health reform and the Whitewater and Paula 
Jones affairs. 
  Washington policymakers have been busy explaining that the 
only superpower in the world cannot be expected to solve all the 
world's problems. Strategists carefully explicated the nature 
of regional-ethnic conflicts, such as those in Bosnia, Somalia, 
Haiti, and Rwanda. Regretting the bloodshed in all these 
places, they nevertheless maintain that the United States must 
conserve its strength for the real tests, such as threats to 
world peace. It so happens, however, that precisely during this 
trial period -- and what is more dangerous than the 
proliferation of nuclear weapons among mad leaders and extremist 
regimes -- this U.S. Administration is being exposed in all its 
weakness. 
  It started with the difficulties in getting Japanese and 
Chinese support for the sanctions against North Korea after Kim 
mocked the United States and the International Atomic Energy 
Agency. After securing most favored nation status, Beijing 
threatened to veto sanctions against its communist neighbor. 
Japan announced it is bound by law to exhaust all diplomatic 
efforts. Even in South Korea, there is a growing opposition to 
escalation with the north. 
  The alliance with the United States has always been one of 
Israel's most important strategic assets. An ally with the 
prestige of a paper tiger, however, does not contribute anything 
to its security. The Jordanian newspaper AL-RA'Y, for example, 
wrote this week that "North Korea has proven that a proud 
country can challenge the United States. Rational neighbors 
such as Beijing, Seoul, and Tokyo can curb U.S. arrogance." If 
this is what the wimps in Amman are saying, what do people in 
Baghdad, Tehran, and Tripoli think? 
  The entire world is following Clinton's pathetic maneuvers 
on 
the North Korean track. The loss of control over its nuclear 
armament efforts and the unsuccessful attempt to implement 
effective sanctions could harm the embargo against Israel's most 
dangerous enemies. 
  It is to be hoped that Hafiz al-Asad will not question the 
reasons for continuing to pin his hopes on these people. 
Incidentally, during the Reagan administration's tenure, Jimmy 
Carter brought a message to Rabin from Damascus regarding 
al-Asad's desire for an arrangement. Rabin, who was defense 
minister at the time, shrugged off Carter's initiative. 
  If it nevertheless transpires that Carter has managed to 
move 
Kim, it is advisable to send him instead of Christopher on the 
"unplanned" visit to Damascus. Even Carter, however, will find 
it hard to have an impact there.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F>
Lili Galili and Amnon Barzilay at the Foreign Ministry in 
Jerusalem on 22 June] 
  [Excerpt] In his office yesterday, in the midst of the 
storm rocking his party and as expectations for far-reaching 
political developments are on the rise, Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres seemed surprisingly calm. To a certain extent, he looked 
like someone forcing himself to display calm out of tactical 
considerations in order to signal that everything was "business 
as usual." His serenity was abruptly ruffled when he was asked 
to reply to questions implying the possibility of a future 
leadership struggle between Yitzhaq Rabin and himself or when 
his replies were interpreted in such a fashion. 
  "Why should I engage in gossip," Peres angrily retorted, "I 
am sick of justifying my actions all the time. I want to talk 
about the really important things." Nevertheless, Peres 
definitely sounded as if he wanted to keep his political options 
open. Even if he does not ultimately make use of these options, 
they will maintain the Labor party's internal balance of terror 
and preclude any possibility of treating Peres like a dead horse 
who no longer has to be appeased. 
  Peres rejected the reports about various "deals" between him 
and Rabin to buy quiet in the party with disgust. His reaction: 
"What are we, horse traders?" The foreign minister made these 
angry remarks on the day newspapers were carrying reports of 
Yosi Beilin's imminent appointment as a cabinet minister, 
describing him as "Peres' minister" and explaining that the 
appointment came as a counterbalance to the recent appointment 
of a "Rabin minister," Efrayim Sne, to the health portfolio. 
Perhaps not horse trading, but definitely minister trading. 
  Peres rejected this description: "Without a doubt, in a 
democracy there are counterbalances. I am not interpreting 
developments, but merely stating facts. It is for the prime 
minister to announce ministerial appointments. I do not want to 
engage in gossip." 
  [HA'ARETZ] Your party is in the midst of a serious crisis 
that could even lead to a split. In the past, with the 
establishment of RAFI [Israel Laborers List, in 1965], you were 
part of a large split in the Labor party. 
  [Peres] I was not part of a large split, I was party to the 
actions of a great man. When I faced the decision of either 
splitting from the party or splitting away from the man, I chose 
to follow David Ben-Gurion, and I do not regret it. The 
situation today is totally different. The party did not hold 
primaries then. 
  [HA'ARETZ] So the primaries are the root of all evil, not 
the 
mistakes made with regard to the national health insurance bill? 
  [Peres] Everything that is happening in the party now is the 
result of the primaries system. As for the national health 
insurance bill, a mistake may indeed have been made; however, 
that is not the real reason for the crisis in the party. What 
is actually happening is that the Knesset members [MK's] seek 
popularity through newspaper headlines. If we do not completely 
remedy this situation, these will continue to be the results. 
  [HA'ARETZ] What do you mean by completely remedy the 
situation? 
  [Peres] We have to divide the country into election 
boroughs, and then the MK's will be elected by the residents of 
a specific borough, as they are in Britain. Democracy is based 
on representation and constituencies. There is no point in 
having elections based on constituencies without the country 
being really divided into election boroughs. The Knesset should 
pass a bill on changing the electoral system. It is 
inconceivable that only the prime minister will be elected in 
real democratic elections while the MK's will continue to be 
elected through a sham process. 
  [HA'ARETZ] The practical ramifications of the change you 
are proposing are a delay in the implementation of direct 
elections for prime minister. Your statements imply that you 
are making your support for direct elections for prime minister 
conditional on changes in the regional election system. 
  [Peres] I think that this condition could be implemented 
within the 30 months we have at our disposal. There is no 
reason why these two electoral changes cannot be passed 
simultaneously, and I will fight for this. Then we will be able 
to reorganize the party and restore a logical order to political 
life. Do not try to impose your terminology on me. I prefer to 
make positive statements. Why should I put things negatively? 
  [HA'ARETZ] Perhaps you choose positive descriptions because 
your fear that the use of other language would be construed as 
the resumption of your leadership struggle with Yitzhaq Rabin? 
  [Peres] If I state something that I believe in, does that 
mean I am announcing my candidacy? There are still another two 
years. I have already made a decision regarding this election 
term and I will respect it for another two years. I do not know 
what will happen in another two years. I will decide at the 
appropriate time. 
  [HA'ARETZ] Do you not fear that, on top of everything else, 
the public will see the Labor party as an oligarchy of old men? 
  [Peres] I do not accept that. We have done great things 
over the last two years. Israel has undergone a fundamental 
change. If old people are capable of effecting this, then why 
not? Do not look at peoples' age, look at the results. 
  [HA'ARETZ] Right now, the results are internal chaos, and 
the members of the Ramon-Meretz Histadrut labor federation list 
are now demanding the dismissal of Hayim Haberfeld [outgoing 
Histadrut secretary general]. What is your reaction to this 
demand? 
  [Peres] The Labor party will not ostracize anyone. 
  [HA'ARETZ] Can you, as someone who in the past was himself 
considered a liability by the party, identify with Haberfeld? 
  [Peres] Some people considered me a liability, while some 
people viewed me as an asset. I do not subscribe to this 
simplistic descriptions. Anyone who reviews my record in the 
party cannot see me as a liability. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by party affairs correspondent Yerah Tal] </F>
  [Excerpts] Knesset Members [MK] Avraham Burg and Rafi Elul 
are initiating a move to abolish the law for direct election of 
prime minister, or at least to postpone its implementation. 
This initiative is backed by many of the Labor's dovish members 
of the Kefar Hayaroq and Mashov circles, who last Thursday set 
up a joint front to promote the it. 
  MK Burg said that this week he will present the Knesset with 
an offer to amend the law. The amendment states that the 
implementation of the law will be postponed until after all the 
basic laws have been incorporated into a state constitution. In 
the congregation last Thursday, MK Burg called for a "democratic 
jihad" against the direct election law. He warned against "a 
severe harm to Israel's democratic regime and civil rights if 
the law is implemented before all the basic laws -- designed to 
secure the civil rights of Israel's citizens -- are passed." 
  Also, MK Elul intends to propose that one-third of the 
Knesset members be elected through regional elections for 
individual candidates. 
  Most of those supporting the Burg-Elul initiative belong to 
the "Peres camp" in Labor. It is therefore believed that Peres 
is behind the initiative. Party members have also expressed 
fear that Rabin might view this initiative as a plot to unseat 
him and reignite the confrontation between him and Peres. 
  Some of Rabin's associates maintain that Peres "is behind 
the 
revolt by Labor secretaries of local labor councils," aimed at 
weakening Rabin. At the same time, Peres' associates are 
accusing Rabin of "selling his soul to Ramon, and not minding to 
sell the party to Ramon as well." 
  [In the same issue of HA'ARETZ, pages A1 and A10, a 800-word 
report by Yerah Tal and Gid'on Alon on the negotiations for the 
establishment of the Histadrut labor federation coalition adds 
that "Labor sources have said that Rabin's functioning as party 
chairman is one of the reasons for the expanding crisis in the 
negotiations between Labor and Ram, Hayim Ramon's list." 
"Senior Labor members of the negotiating team charged that 
Rabin is to blame for legitimizing moves by Ramon's men to set 
up a coalition with Likud members in the Histadrut and in local 
labor councils." The report adds that "the gloomy mood in Labor 
is also the result of the difficulties in expanding the 
government coalition in the wake of the deadlocked negotiations 
with SHAS, the Torah Observing Sephardim."] 
  Tension between Rabin and Peres has been rising recently in 
view of this situation. A senior Labor source said over the 
weekend that Peres was offended when Rabin rejected his request 
to head the negotiating team with Syria for several months in 
order to bring about a breakthrough on this track. "Peres is 
frustrated these days. The agreement with Jordan is, in fact, 
completed; the process with the Palestinians is rolling; and the 
Syrian track is sealed off to Peres. Hence his bitter feeling 
toward Rabin," the Labor source said. He added that he expects 
the open conflict between the two to resume soon. [passage 
omitted] 
  Another idea raised recently is an offer by MK Dalya Itzik 
to 
amend the party constitution so that a Labor prime minister 
could not also serve as party chairman, and for the two roles to 
be absolutely separate. MK Itzik believes that the amendment 
will not be applicable in the next Knesset elections. Therefore 
she intends to appeal to Rabin and the party institutions to 
appoint an emergency leadership for the party. This leadership 
will have to mend the rifts in the party and prepare it for the 
1996 elections. 
  MK Itzik suggests that Rabin delegate some of his authority 
as party chairman to three senior party members who will run 
party affairs with him until the elections, and attempt to 
rehabilitate it. The evident candidate for the role of party 
chairman is Shim'on Peres, but Itzik avoids suggesting this for 
fear of being charged of having considerations associated with 
party camps. This is the reason she is suggesting that Rabin 
delegate authority to three people, not just one. This is also 
called for in view of the expected difficulties in electing one 
person acceptable to all. [passage omitted] 
  The crisis in Labor yielded yet another debate regarding 
internal elections. Many party members are demanding that the 
primary system be abrogated, viewing it as the root of all that 
is evil in the party. MK Gedalya Gal opposes the system, 
claiming that "it leads to the phenomenon of rebellion we are 
witnessing in the party today." MK's Burg and Hagay Merom, on 
the other hand, suggest that the party hold open primaries.

<F P=106> [Report by party affairs correspondent Yerah Tal] </F>
  [Text] Likud Knesset Member [MK] Dan Meridor does not rule 
out the possibility of a territorial compromise if Israel's 
security is assured. This was reported by several people who 
attended a meeting of the "Kefar Vitkin group," the joint forum 
of Likud and Labor MK's on 17 June. The same sources also 
claimed that Likud MK's at the meeting expressed no opposition 
to the relocation of settlements and their concentration in 
large settlement blocs. 
  The Kefar Vitkin group reconvened at MK Mikha'el Eytan's 
house in Kokhav Ya'ir on 17 June. The Labor MK's who 
participated in the meeting were Gedalya Gal, Ori Or, Eli 
Goldschmidt, and Rafi Elul, who recently joined the forum in the 
place of Efrayim Sne who resigned after being appointed health 
minister. The fifth Labor MK in the forum, Deputy Education 
Minister Mikha Goldman, was abroad and therefore absent from the 
17 June meeting. The Likud was represented by MK's Dan Meridor, 
Mikha'el Eytan, David Magen, Avraham Herschson, and 'Ovadya Eli. 
  The forum continued a discussion that started at their first 
meeting two weeks ago, at Gedalya Gal's home in Kefar Vitkin. 
The debate focused on the definition of the security 
requirements Israel must insist upon when signing political 
agreements. 
  Although the participants agreed to maintain secrecy, some 
details of the discussion have been learned. MK Ori Or, the 
chairman of the Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, 
asserted that progress on the Palestinian track must be 
expedited. He noted the need to hold elections expeditiously in 
the territories, even at the expense of movement on the Syrian 
track. 
  Or said that there should be no rush to reach an agreement 
with Syria. The government should not feel under pressure and 
try to reach an agreement with the Syrians before the 1996 
elections. In his opinion, such pressure could result in an 
agreement that was bad for Israel. In Or's opinion, Israel 
should not agree to the stationing of UN observers, 
international forces, of U.S. soldiers in the territories or on 
the Golan Heights. He prefers joint patrols, similar to the 
ones now being carried out by Palestinians and Israelis in the 
autonomous areas. 
  Or said that Israel's security needs necessitate its 
continued control over the Golan Heights, the Jordan Rift 
Valley, the northern part of the Dead Sea, and the Jerusalem 
area, as well as several strategic points where Palestinian 
autonomy should not be permitted. Or mentioned the possibility 
of creating Jewish settlement blocs in Judaea and Samaria and 
did not rule out the possibility of uprooting remote or isolated 
settlements and relocating them inside the Jewish settlement 
blocs. 
  Meridor enumerated the threats to Israel's security that 
would be posed by the establishment of a Palestinian state. As 
stated before, several participants claimed that Meridor did not 
categorically reject a territorial compromise if Israel's 
security was guaranteed. According to these sources, Likud MK's 
did not express any opposition to lumping the Jewish settlements 
in the territories together in large blocs. 
  Yesterday, Meridor denied that he had expressed readiness 
for 
a territorial compromise. He was furious that details of the 
meeting had leaked to the media and said that if these leaks 
continued he would propose to dissolve the forum. 
  The forum members will apparently meet in another two weeks 
at Eli Goldschmidt's home in Kibbutz Deganya. 
  The LEHAVA [Hebrew acronym for Renewal in the Likud 
Movement] 
group has begun signing up Likud Central Committee members on a 
manifesto expressing support for the possibility of territorial 
compromise. The group's members have called for an urgent 
convention of the Likud Central Committee, in which they intend 
to put their political plan to a vote. 
  Statements in support of the Allon Plan, which were voiced 
by 
Dani Kohen, the group's chairman, at a convention of the "Third 
Path" two weeks ago, drew sharp criticism from the Likud 
spokesman who asserted that "Dani Kohen was a marginal figure in 
the Likud." 
  In response, Kohen said that the LEHAVA group comprised 
several hundred party members, including several dozen central 
committee members. 
  The LEHAVA manifesto stipulates that Israel's political plan 
should include its opposition to the establishment of a 
Palestinian state in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip and a 
total rejection of the Right of Return. The plan should note 
Israel's readiness for a territorial compromise -- which would 
only be spelled out in detail in the framework of negotiations. 
Autonomy would only apply to individuals and not to 
territories, and Israel's continued sovereignty over the Jordan 
Rift Valley, the northern part of the Dead Sea, the Golan 
Heights, metropolitan Jerusalem, the 'Etzyon Bloc, the Qatif 
Bloc, and in all the areas of Jewish settlement considered vital 
for security would be guaranteed. 
  It should be noted that despite being entrusted with the 
task 
by the party's central committee over six months ago, the Likud 
bureau has still not formulated a draft proposal for a political 
plan.

  Meanwhile, Tzomet leader Refa'el Eytan said he believes that

is no legal problem with Gonen Segev serving as a minister, 
while the prime minister's legal adviser believes there is no

stage compared with how they were in the past. 
  In an exclusive statement to the Jordanian News Agency, Dr.

His Majesty King Husayn's visit has laid down strong bases for 
bolstering and developing these relations, which became clearer 
concerning the peace process. 
  He said His Majesty King Husayn's talks with U.S. President 
Bill Clinton dotted the i's concerning the economic issue and 
peace. 
  He emphasized that the U.S. President was clear when he 
stressed that Jordan should not bear alone the responsibility of 
peace, but all countries should share Jordan in shouldering this 
responsibility.

  [Text] Information Minister Dr. Jawad al-'Anani has said 
that His Majesty King Husayn's visit to the United States and 
his talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton and senior U.S. 
officials were successful by all standards and opened new 
horizons for relations with the United States based on mutual 
understanding and respect. 
  Speaking to the Jordanian News Agency, the information 
minister said the talks underscored Jordan's independent 
character vis-a-vis the basic political decisions as well as 
Jordan's efforts to maintain distinguished Arab relations in the 
region and its eagerness to promote coordination among the Arab 
parties to the highest possible level. 
  He added that the visit has deepened the relationship 
between 
His Majesty King Husayn and the U.S. President as the talks gave 
them a good opportunity to read the ideas of each other and 
enabled his majesty the king to explain the Jordanian position 
in a comprehensive and accurate manner which helped the U.S. 
President better understand the Jordanian position and realize 
Jordan's basic role in the peace process. 
  Dr. al-'Anani said that by his meetings with senior U.S. 
officials at the State, Commerce, and Defense Departments and 
the House of Representatives, Senate, U.S. press, and several 
influential U.S. figures, His Majesty King Husayn sought to 
secure an understanding of the Jordanian position in order to 
meet the Jordanian demands to conclude the procedures on lifting 
the siege of al-'Aqabah, proceed along the peace process on the 
basis of the Jordanian-Israeli agenda and the appreciation 
expressed for the Jordanian democratization experiment and 
respect for human rights, and improve economic and social 
conditions in Jordan in spite of the large volume of foreign 
debt and the increasing burdens on the Jordanian economy. 
  The information minister said Jordan managed to obtain an 
unequivocal promise from the United States to increase its 
economic aid to Jordan and to seriously consider writing off 
Jordan's official debts to the United States and to cooperate 
with Jordan toward rescheduling Jordanian debts during the Paris 
Club meetings, slated to begin on 27 June, so that the other 
creditors will reduce Jordan's debts to them. 
  Asked about the Jordanian role in the regional peace 
process, Dr. al-'Anani said: In talks with the strongest 
country, it is useful to explain the Jordanian position, 
especially since its decisions, whether on the peace process or 
within the rich group of states, are important and very 
influential. Dialogue with a state like the United States is 
required to explain the Jordanian position and acquire U.S. 
support for this position. 
  He said: Because the U.S. arena is open for all countries, 
maintaining contacts with it emphasizes Jordan's identity, 
legitimate rights, and principled stands. This is what I felt 
took place during the talks held during the visit. 
  The information minister stressed that Jordan has sovereign 
demands which it should obtain through the peace process. These 
are land and water. He said Jordan is perseveringly and 
continuously seeking to secure the rights of refugees and 
evacuees without adversely affecting Jordan's demographic or 
geographic unity. He added that the U.S. side fully understood 
all these points. He said the U.S. side naturally has demands; 
it wishes to see Jordan and the other Arab countries reach a 
peace agreement with Israel. However, this U.S. position does 
not mean that the U.S. political agendas should be imposed on 
Jordan; Jordan should explain its position on the need to have a 
comprehensive peace. This is what took place during this visit. 
  Dr. al-'Anani said: We in Jordan joined the peace process in 
order to restore our rights and help the other Arab parties 
obtain their rights. This is the concept of a comprehensive 
peace which was underscored by President Clinton after his 
meeting with His Majesty King Husayn. 
  The information minister said: It is also obvious that some 
U.S. parties would like to see a meeting between ranking 
Jordanian officials and officials in Israel. However, Jordan's 
position was clear. It said these meetings should not merely be 
symbolic, but must have substance and lead to resolving the 
basic problems. Therefore, timing such meetings depends on the 
course of events and this is what His Majesty King Husayn 
stressed in his meetings with the Congress and the press. 
  He said one of the main dimensions of the results of His 
Majesty King Husayn's visit to the United States is the United 
States' readiness to enable several Jordanians to increase their 
exports to the United States, which constitutes the largest 
market for any country in the world. He said: According to the 
agreement reached between His Majesty King Husayn and President 
Clinton, the Jordanian-U.S. committee held its first meeting at 
the U.S. State Department yesterday. Agreement was reached that 
the committee meetings should be held regularly once every six 
months. During the meeting, Jordan's debts to the United States 
and other creditors and the means to ease them were discussed, 
in addition to increasing U.S. aid to Jordan and increasing 
Jordanian exports to the United States. 
  The information minister said the U.S. side showed an 
understanding of Jordan's defense needs and promised to meet 
them. He added that it is clear that Jordan's reputation among 
the U.S. officials and the U.S. people is high. All of them, he 
said, expressed their admiration for Jordan's wise leadership 
and the democratization process, which is considered an example 
to be emulated and a pioneering experiment in the region. All 
officials also expressed admiration for the respect for human 
rights in Jordan. This is attested by the concerned independent 
international institutions and organizations. In this regard, 
Dr. al-'Anani referred to the World Bank report, which praised 
the Jordanian economic policy in restructuring the economy and 
increasing economic growth as well as Jordan's continuous 
endeavors to improve the citizens' standard of living. The 
report also stressed that Jordan, which is doing its best to 
rectify its economic situation, will need to ease at least 
one-third of its foreign debts so that the volume of debt will 
reach an internationally reasonable level.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "King Husayn's Visit to Washington: Important </F>
Results and Urgent Achievements"] 
  [Text] With the end of His Majesty King Husayn's important 
visit to Washington, and in the wake of the series of meetings 
his majesty the king held with the U.S. President, Congressmen, 
and the secretaries of state and defense, we can say that Jordan 
stands on the threshold of a big historic phase that will 
produce important results on the political and economic levels. 
  In addition to the important achievements attained in this 
visit, we can also note two important accomplishments: First, 
rectifying the course of Jordanian-U.S. relations, which were 
affected by the negative repercussions of the second Gulf war; 
the second accomplishment is represented by the fact that Jordan 
has openly and finally decided its national option through King 
Husayn's announcement that achieving progress on the Jordanian 
track is no longer linked with what is taking place on the other 
tracks. 
  The great importance of this stems from the fact that Jordan 
has reiterated, through this development, its influential peace 
efforts, as well as its commitment to hold -- at the appropriate 
speed -- serious talks on the joint agenda with Israel. Through 
this development, Jordan has also regained the leverage of its 
exceptional role in the peace process and reorganized its 
priorities in light of its long-term interests and in accordance 
with its own views. 
  Jordan has now ended the state in which others have to wait; 
it has ended a situation in which Jordan would be the last party 
to negotiate and the last party to sign. This does not serve 
national interests or higher pan-Arab interests. Furthermore, 
such a situation will not help Jordan restore all its rights to 
land and water and will curb its freedom to exercise its 
sovereign rights. 
  As we look with extreme importance and concern at the 
results 
of His Majesty King Husayn's visit to the American capital, we 
hope that Israel will receive this Jordanian trend with a 
positive spirit and will stop the game of wasting time and the 
tug-of-war policy. The objective is to achieve a fair and 
comprehensive peace that will be accepted by coming generations 
which will feel, through this peace, a change in the quality of 
life of people throughout the entire region.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Husayn Succeeds in Rearranging Priorities"] </F>
  [Text] His Majesty King Husayn has succeeded in breaking, 
and removing completely, the ice that accumulated on relations 
between Jordan and the United States. 
  King Husayn also succeeded in convincing President Clinton, 
his administration's officials, and the U.S. Congress of the 
importance of the effective and influential Jordanian role in 
the achievement of comprehensive peace and restoring security 
and stability to the region. 
  During his meetings and talks with President Clinton and his 
administration's officials, and with various economic, security, 
and political U.S. institutions, His Majesty King Husayn managed 
to confirm his knowledge and experience in managing crises and 
confirmed that the Jordanian role in the region cannot in any 
way be marginalized or ignored. 
  His Majesty King Husayn also persuaded the U.S. 
Administration to take care of priorities and to work on 
addressing the standing issues and problems with Israel before 
talking about the possibility of reaching peace with it. 
Through the U.S. Administration, he managed to convince Israel 
of these requirements, which are the requirements for peace. 
Therefore, an agreement must be reached on delineating borders 
and restoring Jordan's share of water since it is a question of 
sovereignty before anything else. 
  His Majesty King Husayn managed to explain to the U.S. 
Administration and the U.S. Congress the economic and social 
difficulties facing the country as a result of the second Gulf 
War, the blockade of al-'Aqabah, and the Arab boycott and the 
damage it has brought to the Jordanian economy. He stressed 
that unless these issues are addressed, it will be difficult to 
talk about peace and mutual goodwill in the bilateral ties. 
  His Majesty King Husayn succeeded in presenting all these 
facts to President Clinton and his administration officials. He 
received a positive response to his demand and an 
acknowledgement of the soundness of his view and positions and 
the sincerity of his intentions and tendencies. 
  Therefore, His Majesty King Husayn's visit to Washington and 
his meetings and talks there were, by all standards, a success. 
  This success, however, particularly on the level of the 
peace 
talks, will not be at the expense of the Arab brothers or their 
rights. Jordan has from the beginning been committed to, and 
will continue to be committed to, the comprehensive peace. 
  This Jordanian commitment made President Clinton stress his 
administration's commitment to support a settlement on all 
tracks in order to reach a comprehensive peace.

  [Text] Finance Minister Sami Qammuh has said that during 
his meeting with His Majesty King Husayn, U.S. President Bill 
Clinton promised to study Jordan's request to reduce its debt to 
the United States. Speaking to the Jordanian News Agency, he 
added that creditor states were contacted in order to enable 
Jordan to restructure and reduce its debts. 
  Qammuh said he held talks with officials at the U.S. 
Treasury 
and State Departments on the economic and financial situation in 
the Kingdom, particularly the subject of debt and the need to 
address it and find the right solution to reduce it. He added 
that the issue of rescheduling debt at the Paris Club was 
discussed. Jordan asked that the debt due to be paid over the 
next three years be rescheduled. He said the Jordanian side 
received promises from the U.S. Administration to support 
Jordan's request to obtain the best possible terms through the 
Paris Club. We, he said, hope all our requests will be met. 
  The finance minister added that the U.S. side praised the 
serious Jordanian measures to rectify the economy and to 
modernize financial and economic regulations and laws so the 
Kingdom will be able to attract investment and encourage and 
increase national exports. 
  Qammuh left Washington for Paris last night to attend the 
Paris Club meetings on Jordanian debt.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Difficult Road to Restore Rights"] </F>
  [Text] His Majesty King Husayn's visit to the United 
States, during which he held a summit meeting with the U.S. 
President, aimed at explaining the Jordanian stand to Arab and 
world public opinion regarding the progress achieved on the 
Jordanian-Israeli negotiating track. 
  His majesty the king's statements and clarifications were 
heard with great interest by various media and political 
quarters, because these statements and stands showed a clear 
vision, an accurate depiction of the existing situation, and 
adherence to the stands and policies that have always been 
followed by Jordan. 
  At the top of the stands emphasized by His Majesty King 
Husayn is Jordan's sacred right to restore its rights and 
complete sovereignty -- the objective for which Jordan has been 
waging the battle of negotiations. Meanwhile, the king was 
eager to clearly note that Jordan still has to wage a long and 
difficult battle to seize its rights and that the success in 
this battle depends both on continuous Jordanian steadfastness 
and on an Israeli readiness to give up occupied Jordanian 
territory. 
  The direct and deep meaning of this is that Jordan has never 
departed from the battle of extracting its rights and that there 
is still an important, and perhaps long, phase before achieving 
the legitimate national objectives. 
  If we add to this Jordan's commitment to work for a 
comprehensive peace, in accordance with which all Arab rights 
will be restored -- as the peace agreement will crown the 
achievement of a solution to all problems in the region, as his 
majesty put it -- we will find that the road is still long and 
difficult. And this in itself requires moral and political 
support from the Arab brothers and the continuation of a fair 
and earnest U.S. policy to make the achieved progress reach its 
expected and logical end of Israeli withdrawal and the 
restoration of Jordan's international borders as demarcated 
between Palestine and Transjordan during the British mandate. 
  Therefore, the next weeks and months are expected to witness 
a serious, active, and intensive political move on this level 
under the agreed international sponsorship of the U.S., as 
happened and is happening on the other tracks. In light of 
this, it is too early to predict swift and categorical results, 
although it is certain that Jordan will continue its firm 
adherence to its rights and sovereignty to achieve Israeli 
retreat. This is considered a national right and an important 
and major step on the path toward restoring all Arab rights and 
territories.

<F P=106> [Political commentary] </F>
  [Text] Esteemed listeners: Following the savage atrocity 
perpetrated by the Monafeqin [hypocrites, pejorative term for 
Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization, MKO] against the pilgrims at the 
shrine of the eighth imam of the world Shiites, Imam Reza, peace 
be upon him, the Foreign Minister of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran, Dr. Velayati, sent a letter on 22 June to UN Secretary 
General Butrus-Ghali. 
  In this letter, he calls on Butrus-Ghali to increase and 
strengthen cooperation in the campaign against the threat of 
terrorism on the national, regional, and international levels on 
the basis of General Assembly Resolution 48/122 dated 28 August 
1993. 
  As a result of the terroristic action against innocent 
civilians by the Monafeqin grouplet on Monday, 20 June, when its 
members planted a bomb in a holy Islamic place on a day that was 
sacred, 26 pilgrims including many women, children, and old 
people were martyred and 170 were wounded. 
  The reports and investigations by the experts and the 
documentary evidence on this heinous atrocity confirm that this 
act was part of a calculated program by the Monafeqin grouplet. 
The letter from Dr. Velayati to Butrus-Ghali stresses that it 
is the responsibility of all countries to fulfull their 
international commitments in a joint international effort to 
eradicate terrorism. They should not only condemn this inhuman 
and dastardly act, but should also explore the possibility that 
their official institutions, citizens, or their territories are 
being used by this terrorist organization for planning, 
financing, inciting, or supporting such crimes and should take 
effective and appropriate measures to prevent this. 
  It is worth mentioning that unfortunately the adoption of a 
two-faced stance by some of the ostensible supporters of the 
political and international antiterrorist propaganda--with 
regard to the activities of the terroristic groups of the 
Monafeqin in their own countries--is considered responsible for 
creating conditions favorable for this grouplet's premeditated 
crimes. In addition, such countries do not honor their 
commitments to combat international threats and merely mouth 
these commitments for domestic consumption 
  The bloody incident in Mashhad has undoubtedly proved to the 
whole world that, in order to attain its shameful and prurient 
objectives, the terroristic Monafeqin group has trampled on all 
ethical and international norms and does not have the slightest 
regard for divine or human values. 
  The Muslim nation of Iran--by once again standing firm 
against such dastardly catastrophes--has proved that the 
cohesiveness of the Iranian nation can never be undermined and, 
that, with the awareness of the Iranian people, all the cursed 
plots of the foreigners and their mercenary agents will be 
neutralized.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "The Bomb Explosion in Mashhad </F>
and Some Observations"] 
  [Text] As reported by foreign news agencies as well as by 
the regime's propaganda networks, on Monday, 20 June, a strong 
bomb exploded at the Emam Reza Shrine in Mashhad, killing or 
wounding dozens of pilgrims and inflicting damage on the shrine. 
After this incident, the regime's officials immediately blamed 
one of the antiregime organizations for this explosion. 
  Naturally, assassinations, murders, and the planting of 
bombs 
are considered by each and every free-thinking person and 
organization that respects human rights and the lives of human 
beings to be terrorist acts, irrespective of who perpetrates 
such terrorist acts and who the targets are. Therefore, the 
Democratic Party of Kordestan condemns this act and considers it 
to be extremely ugly and inappropriate. 
  The question that arises in this connection is: Who 
perpetrated this terrorist act and what were its purposes and 
objectives? In order to answer this question there are some 
issues that can clarify the situation to a certain extent and to 
show why this inappropriate and antihuman act was perpetrated. 
  First of all, if we try to track down the engineers and 
perpetrators of this terrorist act and to search for the person 
or direction whence such acts emanate -- and these are people 
who are very skillful in perpetrating such acts -- we should, 
first and foremost, point an accusatory finger at the clerical 
regime. This is because this regime is basically a terrorist 
and terrorist- nurturing regime and has perpetrated dozens and 
even hundreds of terrorist acts at home and abroad against its 
opponents, so much so that in the world today and in the eyes of 
the world the name of the Islamic Republic of Iran and of the 
clerical regime is tantamount to terror and terrorism; and it is 
such characteristics and such acts that have made the regime a 
topic of discussion by everyone. 
  But there is a specific reason why this criminal act was 
perpetrated at the place it was and against the lives of 
defenseless people, and a partial examination of this reason 
will help us to solve the riddle. It is a definite and 
indubitable fact and not a secret to anyone that the antipopular 
clergymen are the enemies of all the Iranian people and that 
this regime has no qualms about massacring or killing anyone in 
this country. Moreover, the past has shown that in order to 
achieve its objectives, the clerical regime resorts to any 
incorrect act and to any antipopular plot and machination and 
that it does not spare any crime in order to achieve its ends. 
  Thus, in the chaotic situation that the regime is facing at 
home, and since it cannot answer the people, it is a simple 
matter for it to engineer such plots, to perpetrate such 
incidents so that it can distract the public from major problems 
and focus the people's attention on other issues such as this, 
to further pave the way for more suppression and pressure at a 
time when the people's voice of protests and aversion has 
intensified, and to thus impose a more stifling condition on the 
people. 
  Meanwhile, we see that in order to show that, contrary to 
what is said against it, the clerical regime--which is regarded 
as a terrorist regime by the public because of its continued 
terrorist acts and the violation of human rights and is 
condemned by humanitarian circles and forums and by human rights 
supporters at least twice a year--is itself the target of terror 
and terrorism and that if it sometimes adopts suppressive 
measures, its only objective is to fight terrorism and 
subversion. Thus, it further paves the way for the suppression 
and assassination of its opponents at home and abroad. 
  The time and place of the bomb explosion shows how the 
regime 
perpetrated this plan through careful planning so that it could 
rouse the religious sentiments of simple-minded people. Thus, 
the Emam Reza Shrine was chosen--and that, in the month of 
Muharram and during the Tas'ua and 'Ashura ceremonies. 
Otherwise, if it was any other person or persons apart from the 
regime--that is, if the said person or persons believe in 
terrorism and in planting bombs--there are better places and 
better objectives that can inflict damage and blows on the 
regime and its officials and not on ordinary and defenseless 
people. 
  We do not rule out the fact that after the explosion of this 
bomb by the regime's men and on orders of the regime's 
intelligence and terrorist networks, a new wave of suppression 
will be started by the regime and for this to be transformed 
into a pretext for the compilation and implementation of a new 
program of pressures on the people of our country in general and 
on members of opposition organizations in particular. For this 
purpose, each and every one of us should reveal such plots and 
vile machinations by the regime and further inform the public of 
the regime's plots and ploys as much as possible.

lives of 26 mourners on the day of Ashura (martyrdom anniversary 
of Imam Hussein) and injured about 170 others.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] In the wake of the atrocious crime of perpetrated by 
the terrorist grouplet Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization against 
the pilgrims of the holy mausoleum of the eighth Imam of the 
world Shiite, Imam Reza, peace be upon him, in a letter 
addressed to the UN Security General Butrus-Ghali, on Wednesday 
June the 22nd, foreign minister of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
urged him to strengthen cooperation in combating the threat of 
terrorism at national, regional and international levels on the 
basis of the UN General Assembly Resolution 122 released on 28th 
of August 1992. In the course of the terrorists' act 
perpetrated by the Monafeqin grouplet on June 20th and their 
bomb attack on a sacred Islamic place on a holy day against the 
ordinary people at least 26 pilgrims, including a large number 
of women, children and elderly people were martyred and 170 
others were injured. 
  Expert reports and investigations and documents recovered in 
this atrocious crime confirm that the terrorist grouplet 
Monafeqin has been responsible for this premeditated and 
pre-engineered act. In this relation, in Mr. Velayati's letter 
to Butrus-Ghali it has been emphasised that it is a duty upon 
all countries that in a common international endeavour against 
terrorism and in a bid to fulfil their international obligation 
and commitments not only denounce this inhuman and cowardly act 
but also conduct necessary investigations into the possibility 
of their official organizations, citizens or their territories 
being used by these terrorist group for planning, financing, 
encouraging or supporting these crimes and to take effective 
steps to prevent them from carrying out their designs. 
  It is worth noting that unfortunately the option of dual 
stands and failure of a number of superficial advocated of 
international political propaganda against terrorism to prevent 
the activities of the terrorist group MKO inside their countries 
is regarded as an encouragement for the continuation of such 
organized crimes by this organization. Moreover it casts 
serious doubt on the adherence of such countries to their 
commitment in combating this international threat. Obviously 
the bloody tragedy of Mashhad proved to the whole world that the 
terrorist grouplet Monafeqin will trample upon all human and 
moral norms in a bid to achieve its disgraceful and evil goals 
and refuses to attach the slightest importance to human and 
divine values. The Iranian Muslim nation, once again, through 
resistance in the face of such tragedies, proved that their 
coherence and solidarity of the Iranian nation will never be 
damaged and that it will defuse and neutralise all the sinister 
designs of the aliens and their hirelings.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar </F>
Velayati by Amin Muhammad Amin; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati has 
stressed that his meetings with Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr 
Musa dealt openly with the two countries' views on a number of 
issues and the means of building confidence between them. He 
said that both Iran and Egypt are of major importance due to 
their unique positions on the world map. He invited the United 
Arab Emirates [UAE] to visit Teheran to continue the dialogue 
over the three islands. 
  Velayati denied that his country has given support to any 
terrorist group in Egypt or Algeria. He noted that Egypt and 
Iran have to cooperate in the regional and international 
spheres. He also denied that there are Egyptian prisoners in 
Iran from the Iraqi-Iranian war, stressing that all Egyptian 
prisoners have been handed over to Egypt. 
  On the obstacles impeding the restoration of relations 
between Egypt and Iran, Velayati said that Israel and 
cooperation with it are the main obstacles. 
  [Amin] Does this apply to all the Arab countries with which 
you have good relations but which are seeking peace with Israel? 
  [Velayati] The matter differs from one country to another 
according to the interest that countries show toward Israel. 
Our relations are based on this. 
  [Amin] This means that you do not now support the 
Palestinian 
cause, especially after the Palestinian-Israeli agreement? 
  [Velayati] Palestine does not have a united stand. We 
support justice and reject humiliation for the Palestinian 
people at the hands of Israel, which is looking to increase its 
hegemony over the other countries in the region. Therefore, we 
will not stand idle and see the whole region fall under Israeli 
hegemony. 
  [Amin] But the international conditions have changed, the 
power struggle in the world is over, and the current move is 
toward peace. 
  [Velayati] Do the international conditions allow one party 
alone to use force but not others? If this is the new world 
reality, then does this mean that we should all rush to hand 
over the region, which is the heart of the Islamic world, to the 
enemies, when our grandfathers fought for more than two 
centuries? Are we required to be beaten and to depend on 
Israel's mercy? 
  [Amin] If the parties to the conflict have accepted a 
peaceful solution, why then this insistence on continuing the 
fighting and the armed confrontation? 
  [Velayati] The struggle must continue. We have before us the 
example of South Africa, which we supported. 
  Certainly, any step must have an effect. There is a 
difference between those who welcome and bless peace and those 
who are compelled to make peace. 
  [Amin] Then, in your view, the Palestinians and Syrians are 
being compelled to reach an agreement and to go along with the 
peace process? 
  [Velayati] They are certainly being compelled to do so. What 
is happening in Gaza now is ample proof of this. 'Arafat is 
merely the mayor of Gaza and Jericho and his entry there means 
that Israel has become the master of the situation in the 
region. Hence, the Palestinian-Israeli agreement is not a 
profitable deal. 
  [Amin] This means Iran will not back the Palestinian 
self-rule authority. 
  [Velayati] Of course we will not back Palestinian self-rule, 
because while Israel has given back one part, it has taken 100 
parts in a strange and unequal deal. 
  [Amin] What about Gulf security? 
  [Velayati] The security of the region cannot be established 
except through the desire of the Gulf countries themselves. 
  [Amin] Will this take place by establishing a strong joint 
military force or a united organization? 
  [Velayati] These are the many and varied stages of the road 
to cooperation. It starts out with economic, political, and 
security cooperation. But we have not yet discussed the origins 
and bases of the idea. 
  Unfortunately, we in the Gulf region have got the big 
arms-exporting powers used to making us various offers of arms 
deals. They create a whimsical danger to blackmail the region 
and stockpile arms there. The danger is constantly being moved 
around and the attrition continues. 
  [Amin] If Iran realizes the effects of the arms race in the 
region, why does it participate as a major party? 
  [Velayati] We are the country in the region that buys the 
least amount of weapons in relation to our population. Our 
expenditure on arms does not exceed 4 percent of the Iranian 
budget. 
  [Amin] What about the Gulf countries with a low population 
density? 
  [Velayati] If this criterion is applied, every small country 
would have the right to buy more weapons than it could absorb. 
This is a dangerous criterion to apply. 
  [Amin] What about your stance regarding arms deals with the 
United States? 
  [Velayati] The United States does not sell us weapons. It 
has frozen all deals made with it during the shah's rule. We 
are getting our weapons from other sources. 
  [Amin] Your stance on the occupation of the three UAE 
islands, Tunb al-Sughra, Tunb al-Kubra, and Abu Musa, 
constitutes an obstacle to restoring confidence with the Arabian 
Gulf states. 
  [Velayati] We are fully confident that if there is to be a 
solution to this problem, it must take place through peaceful 
dialogue. But if one party wants to corner the other party and 
internationalize the problem, this party will lose more than the 
other. We started peaceful dialogue with the UAE in Abu Dhabi a 
year ago and agreed to convene a second meeting for dialogue in 
Tehran. That meeting has not taken place. 
  Velayati said that through AL-AHRAM he extends an invitation 
to the UAE foreign minister to visit Tehran to continue their 
peaceful dialogue regarding the islands anytime he likes. 
  [Amin] There are some accusations indicating that Iran backs 
the terrorist organizations hiding behind the guise of religion 
in the region. 
  [Velayati] We vehemently deny these accusations. Let anyone 
who has proof of this come forward. We have never supported any 
terrorist group in Egypt or Algeria. Unfortunately, some 
Western forces are playing a major role in escalating terrorist 
and extremist currents in the region. 
  [Amin] What is your comment on events in Yemen? 
  [Velayati] We support the continuation of unity in Yemen and 
a peaceful solution of all the problems that pose an obstacle to 
the march of unity. We support solving problems through 
dialogue, not fighting.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Velayati described relations 
between the Islamic Republic of Iran and Germany as positive and 
stated that Bonn-Tehran cooperation has gone beyond bilateral 
relations and has adopted regional and international dimensions. 
  Velayati was speaking last night in an exclusive interview 
with our correspondent after his return from Germany and 
Switzerland. Velayati added: The second joint economic 
commission of Iran and Germany will meet in the fall, and the 
third joint cultural session of the two countries will convene 
this summer in Bonn and in Tehran. 
  Underlining the importance of cooperation between the ECO 
[Economic Cooperation Organization] and the European Union [EU], 
he pointed out that the two countries will meet in the future 
within their capacities as heads of the two organizations. 
  Referring to Germany's efforts for Iran's cooperation with 
the EU, Velayati said that on the basis of an agreement, he is 
to meet the EU leadership in the margin of the UN General 
Assembly in Mehr [month beginning 23 September 1994]. 
  Continuing, the foreign minister said that the presence of 
the Iranian delegation at the World Forum in Switzerland was a 
positive political step for the Islamic Republic of Iran and 
added: The participants in the World Forum welcomed Iran's 
pivotal role in decreasing regional and international conflicts.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] The entire West Bank has been the scene of bloody 
demonstrations against the Zionist usurpers on Wednesday [23 
June]. The demonstrations have been staged at a time when 
thousands of Palestinians in the Zionist regime's prisons are 
staging a hunger-strike to protest against the anti-human 
policies of that regime. Hundreds of Palestinians in Nablus, 
Ramallah, Jerusalem, and Bethelem cities staged demonstrations 
in support of the Palestinian prisoners protesting against the 
Zionist usurpers' policies of detaining and suppressing the 
Palestinians. Tens of Palestinians were subjected to the burst 
of machine gun fire during clashes between the Israeli troops 
and the Palestinian protesters and a large number of them were 
wounded. 
  At this important juncture what we are witnessing is the 
fact 
that the peace-seeking mask has fallen from the face of the 
Zionist usurpers. As a matter of fact, despite its earlier 
commitments regarding having negotiations with all the Arab 
delegations within the framework of the Security Council 
resolutions, the Zionist regime concluded the Gaza-Ariha 
(Jericho) accord by violating the commitment; the accord, that 
on the basis of international law, has no legal link with the 
principle of autonomy. 
  Despite Israel's commitment thousands of Palestinians are 
still being detained in the dreaded Israeli prisons. The 
Israeli officials have informed the PLO of their conditions, 
saying the Palestinian prisoners should sign undertakings in 
confirmation of the Gaza-Ariha accord and following their 
release they will not be permitted to return to their 
birth-places. They can only live in Gaza and Ariha. There is 
no doubt that the announcement of these conditions by the 
Zionist usurpers is a breach of international agreements, 
especially the fourth Geneva convention which rejects any 
disrespect to life and property of a nation under occupation and 
condemns the same. 
  On the other hand such a move by the Zionist regime is a 
blatant violation of all the commitments signed by the regime 
which has promised to free all the prisoners unconditionally. 
  Now in light of these facts the world opinion is once again 
confronted with the reality that it is the inefficiency of the 
world bodies, especially that of the UN in dealing with the 
regime firmly that has encouraged the Zionist regime to continue 
the massacre and suppression of the innocent Palestinian nation.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mostafa Hidshri, chief of the Kurdistan </F>
Democratic Party -- Iran, by Thomas Dreger in Bonn on 16 June: 
"Kinkel Did Not Answer Me"] 
  [Text] [Dreger] Whom did you meet in the FRG? 
  [Hidshri] The Berlin senior public prosecutor in connection 
with the "Mykonos lawsuit," and deputies from the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], the Greens, and the Christian 
Democratic Union [CDU]. 
  [Dreger] That is to say, you did not have any contact with 
representatives of the government or the Foreign Ministry? 
  [Hidshri] I asked for a meeting with Foreign Minister 
Kinkel, but I did not get an answer. I think that this is 
connected with the presence of Iranian Foreign Minister 
Velayati. Apparently, economic interests are more important to 
the FRG Government than human rights and support for democratic 
forces. 
  [Dreger] Mr. Velayati was received by the chancellor, 
Foreign Minister Kinkel, and Economics Minister Rexrodt. If you 
had had the chance to also talk to these persons, what would you 
have told them? 
  [Hidshri] I would have said: Your support keeps the inhuman 
Iranian regime alive. It enables the Islamic Republic to 
continue its hostile attitude toward world peace -- for example, 
toward the agreement between the PLO and Israel -- to support 
fundamentalist organizations, and to oppress its own people. 
Democracy in Germany has fallen victim to economic interests. 
  [Dreger] You discussed the "Mykonos lawsuit" with a public 
prosecutor. What is your impression of this lawsuit? 
  [Hidshri] I think that the real perpetrators are standing 
trial. However, I am convinced that Iran is trying to influence 
these proceedings by economic concessions to the FRG. An 
example is the visit of Fallahian, Iranian minister for security 
and intelligence services, shortly before the beginning of the 
lawsuit. Mr. Schmidbauer (minister of state in the FRG 
Chancellor's Office and coordinator of the German intelligence 
services, who received Fallahian in October 1993 -- the editors) 
admitted that Fallahian had pressed for the abandonment of the 
lawsuit. I am afraid that the clarification of the murder will 
be sacrificed to economic interests. 
  [Dreger] Your two predecessors were murdered in Europe. Do 
you feel safe on this trip? 
  [Hidshri] I do not feel safe anywhere. It is the policy of 
the Islamic Republic to eliminate its opponents all over the 
world. The leading persons of my party are sentenced to death. 
I have a copy of a letter from the chief of staff of the 
Iranian Revolutionary Guards. In it, the order to murder two 
persons is given. One of them is Chao Hosseini [name as 
published], member of the Central Committee of my party and 
foreign representative of the Kurdistan Democratic Party [KDP] 
-- Iran in Paris. In 1991 an attempt on my life was made with a 
bomb in Iraqi Kurdistan. My bodyguard died. All that is 
happening at a time when the FRG Government calls the Iranian 
leadership "pragmatic." 
  [Dreger] How is currently the situation in Iranian 
Kurdistan? 
  [Hidshri] There are more than 50,000 Iranian soldiers and 
Revolutionary Guards in Kurdistan. Since the founding of the 
Islamic Republic, Iranian troops have destroyed 300 villages. 
Our political work is done underground. Our partisans act as 
guerrillas. 
  [Dreger] What are the chances of a Kurdish movement in Iran 
at present? 
  [Hidshri] It can weaken the central government and motivate 
the people to put up resistance and to draw the attention of 
Europe and the neighboring countries to itself. However, it 
cannot force the leadership of the Islamic Republic to initiate 
democratization. It will struggle against any democratic 
movement to its last breath. 
  [Dreger] How stable is the Iranian leadership? The economic 
situation of the country is bad, there have been riots. 
  [Hidshri] All indications of stability are due to economic 
support from the West. 
  [Dreger] What are your relations with the Iranian 
opposition? 
  [Hidshri] We have good relations with all, except for the 
Mojahedin-e-Khalq and the monarchists. 
  [Dreger] What is your primary objective: An independent 
Kurdistan or a democratic Iran? 
  [Hidshri] A democratic Iran where our national rights and 
human rights are guaranteed. 
  [Dreger] You have now arrived from Iraqi Kurdistan. What 
does this autonomous region, which has been in existence since 
the end of the second Gulf war, mean for the Kurds as a whole? 
  [Hidshri] No matter in what part of Kurdistan the Kurdish 
people attain their rights, this has positive effects on the 
other parts. The founding of such a democracy in (Iraqi) 
Kurdistan is contributing to the democratization of the whole 
region. Exactly for this reason, the neighboring countries are 
trying to kill this democracy. For one year, Iran has been 
shelling Iraqi Kurdistan with grenades and it has sent 
terrorists to the region. 
  [Dreger] For six weeks, however, not only Iranians have shot 
at Kurds, but also Kurds at Kurds in Iraqi Kurdistan. What are 
the causes of this conflict? 
  [Hidshri] Iran created the prerequisites for this war. 
Since the establishment of the Kurdish regional government in 
summer 1992, it has infiltrated its agents into the ranks of the 
two big Iraqi-Kurdish parties, the KDP and the Patriotic Union 
of Kurdistan. 
  [Dreger] Is it not somewhat simple to say that everything 
comes from the outside? 
  [Hidshri] The two Kurdish parties are not innocent. 
However, the Islamic Republic is the most important factor in 
this war. 
  [Dreger] Do you see a chance to settle this conflict? 
  [Hidshri] Iran will not stop sabotaging the Kurdish 
autonomy. In order to put an end to the war, both parties have 
to struggle against this main cause. 
  [Dreger] The autonomous region is viable because aircraft 
of the Gulf war allies are circling above the area. Their 
mandate is prolonged every six months, but it does not offer 
more long-term prospects. What would have to happen to secure 
the future of the Kurds? 
  [Hidshri] The allies should regard the Kurdish issue as a 
political, not a humanitarian question. In Iraqi Kurdistan, 
only humanitarian support has been provided so far. Of course, 
this has to be welcomed, but there is a lack of political 
support. 
  [Dreger] Would that mean the recognition of an independent 
Kurdistan? 
  [Hidshri] An independent Kurdistan is not at issue. The 
allies should see to it that the Kurdish regional government can 
establish itself in a federatal Iraq. Iraqi Kurdistan is today 
quite up in the air. This problems should be solved with the 
Iraqi central government in a federatal system. 
  [Dreger] The conflict in north Iraq is nourishing the cliche 
of the Kurds being at variance. Can you envisage a joint state 
some day? 
  [Hidshri] We are not talking of an independent Kurdistan. 
It is not in our program and today it is impossible to 
translate it into reality. It is not our problem that we have 
parties with different political orientations. One of our 
problems is that we do not deal democratically with each other. 
However, we are not to blame for it. Our people never learned 
democracy. We need a democratic atmosphere in which we can deal 
with each other. 
  [Dreger] The Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] is the best 
known Kurdish organization here. What is your policy toward it 
and what do you think of the ban on the PKK by the FRG 
Government? 
  [Hidshri] We are in contact with the PKK, but we criticize 
its course of action. I think that the ban is inappropriate. 
The world must understand that the PKK actions are reactions to 
the inhuman course of action of the Turkish Government against 
the Kurdish people. 
  [Dreger] The Iranian Government has become notorious by 
Khomeyni's call for the murder of Salman Rushdie. What do you 
think of the conflict over Rushdie? 
  [Hidshri] I condemn the call for his murder. But I also 
say: The regime that sentenced Rushdie to death murdered 
thousands of people, without anybody doing something against it. 
Europe seems to have divided the people into classes. Salman 
Rushdie as a European must not be threatened. Iranians, 
however, may be killed, their life seems to be worthless.

  [Text] The Janata Dal parliamentary party leader, Mr. 
Sharad Yadav, and Mr. Ram Vilas Paswan, MP, are of the view that 
their party has no president at present. Briefing newsmen in 
New Delhi today, they said that had proposed constitution of a 
steering committee for leading the party. They alleged that 
yesterday's split in the party was aimed at destabilizing the 
Lalu Prasad Yadav government in Bihar. 
  Meanwhile, in Patna, a number of Janata Dal MP's and MLA's 
[Members of Legislative Assembly] at a meeting have expressed 
full faith in the leadership of the chief minister, Mr. Lalu 
Prasad Yadav. The chief minister later told newspersons that 
all the ministers and legislators present in Patna attended the 
meeting. On the contrary, Mr. Nitish Kumar, a member of the 
breakaway Janata Dal claimed in Patna today that 90 percent of 
the party's rank and file supported his group in Bihar. He also 
claimed that a majority of party members in the Rajya Sabha will 
soon join the new group. Another member of the split group, Mr. 
Harikishore Singh, told our correspondent in New Delhi that 
their group would like the president of Janata Dal, Mr. Bommai, 
to cooperate with them for upholding the ideals for which the 
party has always stood for. Mr. Bommai, on the other hand, told 
newspersons in Bangalore that he will reach New Delhi tomorrow 
in a bid to bring back the breakaway group of MP's back into 
party fold. He described the decision by the 14 MP's as 
unfortunate, but not unexpected. Orissa chief minister, Mr. 
Biju Patnaik, told newspersons in Bhubaneshwar that the split 
will not have any impact on the party in Orissa. 
  Reacting on the split of the Janata Dal, the Congress-I 
spokesman, Mr. V.N. Gadgil, told newsmen in New Delhi that it is 
always sad in a democracy when a party splits. But, in the case 
of Janata Dal, it was inevitable. He said the Janata Dal was 
never a homogeneous party with leaders having no following. 
  The BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] says only those political 
parties which have grown on the basis of an ideology will 
survive. The party spokesperson, Mrs. Sushmaswaraj, said that 
the political which have merged for political convenience will 
break up and disappear.

  [Text] The prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, has 
called for the involvement of Panchayats [rural bodies] to 
disseminate information about developmental activities. 
Inaugurating the 21st conference of state ministers of 
information and cinematography in New Delhi today, he said 
Panchayat leaders should form part of a vital link in the two 
way communicational structure that should be established. This, 
he said, is very essential as a large number of beneficiaries of 
social welfare schemes are ignorant of them. Drawing attention 
to the revolution that is taking place in the field of 
information technology, Mr. Rao said we should preserve our 
cultural identity to prevent our society from becoming 
directionless. 
  Ruling out banning of satellite television channels, the 
prime minister said that Doordarshan [Indian Television] and All 
India Radio have a lot to learn from foreign media though they 
should not emulate them. He called for more attention to 
developing the programs that will be presented to the people. 
  In his keynote address, the information and broadcasting 
minister, Mr. K.P. Singh Deo, called for better coordination 
between the central and state governments to make mass 
communication more effective. He said his ministry is having a 
fresh look at the composition and terms of inter-media publicity 
coordination committees that are already working at the state 
level. 
  The meeting is discussing in three sessions the subjects of 
entertainment tax and films, interpersonal media, and the 
electronic media.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Shankar Aiyar and Raghu Nandan Dhar under the </F>
rubric "Telecom Policy Mess": "Can the Centre Wriggle Out?"] 
  [Text] Bombay -- If there is anything clear about the 
telecom policy, it is the smoke signals of controversy emanating 
from its impending implementation. Also clear is the tact the 
lobbyists of every hue and class -- multinationals, mixed breed 
companies and pure Indian corporate houses -- are all attempting 
to cook the goose their way. 
  Facing this music is a bewildered Ministry of 
Communications, 
a confused Ministry of Finance [MoF] and a much-pilloried 
Department of Telecommunications [DoT] which believe that the 
easiest way out of the mess is to hand over the sector to the 
MNCs [multinational corporations] lock, stock and barrel. 
  In the cacophony of confusion that is currently prevailing, 
there are some voices emerging. Like that of D. Sengupta of 
ICICI's [Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of 
India's] Telecom Group (I-TEL) which has submitted two important 
papers -- on the regulatory body where he has stated the need 
for immediately establishing the authority before any decisions 
are taken and one on the entry conditions. 
  Highly placed sources in Department of Economic Affairs 
[DEA], which is co-ordinating the strategies for implementation 
along with Ministry of Communications and MoF, has in principle 
accepted I-TEL's recommendations for a telecom regulatory 
authority (except for the name...ICICI's I-TEL suggested ORBIT 
while the ministry has decided on TRA [Telecom Regulatory 
Authority]) 
  Even DoT has along with DEA accepted the broad terms of 
reference suggested by I-TEL. Besides, the immediate need for 
instituting Telecom Regulatory Authority, the other 
recommendation that has been heard, is to allow private firms 
exclusive licence for a region for five years. Further, it has 
recommended that self-generated proposals should not be accepted 
as a rule and even if the proposal is extremely good it needs to 
be convened into a tender. 
  Sengupta's team spoke to AT&amp;T, US West, Telstra 
Motorola and 
Sprint among others. To start with, it is surprising that an 
institutionally-backed cell has not spoken to any Indian 
corporate house or industry association. What is even more 
surprising is that the Sengupta committee has recommended 
foreign equity participation at as high as 49 per cent (51 per 
cent with Indians and NRIs [nonresident Indians]) when no 
country in the world allows foreigners such a high proportion of 
equity. 
  Even the Gods of capitalism, Americans do not allow equity 
of 
over 20 per cent. So the question-now to be asked is why 
MoF/DEA, and broadly speaking Government of India, are so keen 
to offer high levels of equity to the foreigners despite the 
clearly spelt out issue of national security? Surely the I-TEL 
group couldn't be unaware of the fact that capital markets have 
been opened and Indians can now go abroad and raise funds 
through the Euro-route. Why should there be an equity 
participation to start with? Can't the companies buy technology 
with monies raised abroad? What is worse is the manner in which 
Department of Economic Affairs has swallowed the recommendations 
(over which, thankfully, there has been no decision as yet). 
  These are but the primary issues. What Government needs to 
remember is that there is a waiting list of 3.5 million for 
telephone connections and to be able to service. "Telephone on 
demand by 1997", Government will need to put through 10 million 
lines through the Eighth Five Year Plan which would cost 
Government, at conservative estimates, around Rs 23,000 crore. 
  Very clearly, Government has to adopt some mantras for a 
successful implementation of NTP [national telecom policy]. The 
crucial route to success is essentially in tackling six basic 
areas: They are: 
  The right service area. 
  Number of competitors in local and long distance. 
  Seamless basic services. 
  Operating expertise. 
  Swift licensing process. 
  Independent regulator with a clearly defined role. 
  Let's take the issue of the right service area. Currently, 
DoT services are split in major units (18 circles and four metro 
districts) and minor units (321 telecom districts). In this, a 
third of the calls are local and two-thirds are long distance. 
In short, any company needs this mix to survive. 
  Even globally, most countries allow a kind of duopoly where 
operators are allowed access to areas exclusively while 
connecting them to trunk carriers. Particularly interesting is 
the UK experience where they franchised the entire country to a 
second carrier and allowed a third one recently to build market 
share. India should also follow a similar pattern and split the 
network into state-wide operating territories and club the 
north-east (to make a viable unit) allowing preferably one 
operator exclusively in a region. 
  As for the question of number of competitors, India is 
admittedly resource starved and hence there is little point in 
duplicating investments. There should be enough revenue 
potential to encourage growth and investment while at the same 
time competition to help improve service, quality and 
productivity. In fact world-wide, most countries allow one 
operator in an area (duopoly) and in US, it is just one 
operator...obviously aimed at curbing duplication of investments 
and counter-productive competition. Like UK, India too could 
consider duopoly for five years before reviewing the situation. 
  The moolah is in long distance as even MTNL [Mahanagar 
Telephone Nigam Limited] would agree. Telephone service cannot 
be isolated as only local or only long distance as it would be 
patently unfair. Witness the deterioration of services in 
Thailand where they kept only one long distance operator. 
  What India needs to do is to first decongest (the jammed) 
long distance and international traffic. One or even two more 
operators should be involved in augmenting the network (even 
through Build and Operate networks) laid by DoT. Secondly it 
should allow only one local licencee connected to long distance 
carriers with enough scope for customer traffic. Ideally, there 
should be one licencee within the state (who could also operate 
in another region/circle) but long distance should be allowed to 
criss-cross the country through state networks.

  [Text] Cairo, 23 Jun (MENA) -- Interior Minister Hasan 
al-Alfi has stated that recent achievements by the security 
forces in various confrontations with the terrorist and 
extremist elements require the security forces to be more 
vigilant and to exert greater efforts to achieve the security 
and stability sought by society and help with construction and 
development. 
  He said the security bodies have halted the acts of 
terrorism 
and extremism but have not reached "the final point." He 
stressed that the security bodies are determined to uproot the 
remnants of the deceived and corrupt elements so as to protect 
the homeland and citizens from their evil. 
  Speaking today at the graduation of the first group of 
graduates from the Police Commissioners Academy, the interior 
minister said the security forces are not operating alone in 
combating terrorism; they are backed by the people's forces and 
supported by the masses, who have realized the real nature of 
this evil group and what is really going on behind the scenes. 
  The interior minister said that efforts and achievements 
have 
been made in other security fields, such as the political and 
criminal fields, similar to the achievements in the 
confrontation of the elements of terrorism and extremism. He 
stressed that the ideological and media confrontation, together 
with the courageous security fight, have played an effective 
role in exposing these criminal elements to the masses. 
  He praised the graduates of the Police Commissioners 
Academy, 
hailing their introduction as a boost to the police presence in 
the Egyptian street.

<F P=106> [Report by Mahmud Bakri] </F>
  [Text] When the legitimate Yemeni forces were on the verge 
of settling the military confrontation in their favor after 
tightening the noose on the secessionists, reports spoke 
strongly of Saudi military concentrations on the Yemeni border. 
This portends the danger that the conflict will expand and 
deteriorate in that vital region. 
  The conspiratorial role played by Saudi Arabia against 
fraternal Yemen is part of an orchestrated campaign led by the 
United States and carried out by its agents in the region. U.S. 
State Department reports had warned against the danger of Yemeni 
unity to the Gulf region in general and to Saudi Arabia in 
particular. The White House called for the need to accelerate a 
crisis in Yemen that could kill the unity. 
  At the time, U.S. oil companies, especially Hunt, had 
discovered huge oil finds in the south of Yemen, most notably in 
Hadramaut. The company sent reports to U.S. officials affirming 
that the Saudi-Yemeni border area had great oil potential. The 
company expressed its concern over the difficulties it found in 
digging and prospecting for oil in the Saudi-Yemeni border area. 
  The company frankly noted that oil exploration and 
prospecting in the border areas would lead to deep political 
problems between Yemen and Saudi Arabia. Out of its commitment 
to the basic motives of the U.S. strategy in the Gulf region, 
the company asked U.S. officials for advice. It also asked that 
the necessary measures be taken in this connection. 
  The report by Hunt clearly indicated that the process of the 
border demarcation between Saudi Arabia and Yemen does not 
include clear provisions on who controls the oilfields. 
  At that time and in accordance with the NAFTA agreement 
between the United States and its Latin American neighbors, a 
report by the Canadian company Canoscy mentioned that this 
region contains--according to initial estimates--only 700 
million barrels. Noting that several European companies had 
begun invading the region, Washington expressed its concern at 
the effect of this on U.S. interests. The Canoscy report 
mentioned that around 40 European companies secured privileges 
to explore and prospect for oil in the region. 
  In view of this, U.S. officials intervened so that Hunt 
would 
get the lion's share of oil prospecting in south Yemen. For 
this purpose, butcher Schwarzkopf, who led the war to destroy 
Iraq, and Zionist Henry Kissinger (Both work as advisers to 
Hunt) paid a secret visit to Saudi Arabia in March. They met 
Saudi officials and discussed ways to secure full control of 
Yemeni oil. They claimed that north Yemen promised Iraqi 
President Saddam Husayn that it would provide him with oil 
royalties to enable him to rebuild Iraq's military power and 
regain Iraq's superiority. They also claimed that this deal was 
cut as part of a plan under which Iraq would modernize the 
Yemeni army, transfer military and technical expertise to Yemen, 
and enable Yemen to produce chemical weapons and weapons of mass 
destruction. 
  Schwarzkopf and Kissinger claimed that in view of this, 
Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf states would fall between the 
jaws of an Iraqi-Yemeni pincer with the aim of controlling the 
Gulf oil. 
  Former U.S. President George Bush--who was appointed by Hunt 
as a senior adviser, in addition to his posts in other oil 
companies such as Exxon--was holding covert meetings with the 
Saudi ambassador in Washington, Prince Bandar Bin-Sultan, who 
was the real leader of the front coordinating with the Americans 
regarding Yemen. 
  This was preceded by secret meetings between secessionist 
leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid--when he was Yemeni vice president--and 
U.S. Vice President Al Gore during al-Bid's visit to Washington 
for treatment last summer. Al-Bid asked for a meeting with the 
U.S. vice president away from the gaze of the Yemeni ambassador 
in Washington and embassy staff members. Al-Bid granted annual 
leave to Yemeni Ambassador Muhsin al-'Ayni, who received 
instructions from the Yemeni leadership in Sanaa to follow up 
al-Bid's meetings in Washington. The Yemeni ambassador did not 
realize the motives behind al-Bid's action. So the ambassador 
informed the Yemeni capital that al-Bid did not intend to hold 
meetings with U.S. officials. 
  Information has it that al-Bid met Al Gore, who affirmed 
that 
Washington would support him whatever stance he adopted. Al 
Gore stressed that his country is governed by two basic options 
regarding Yemeni unity. 
  The first option: If unity continued, Washington would 
prefer 'Ali Salim al-Bid to be president of the state of unity. 
Washington did not trust 'Ali Abdallah Salih's intentions, 
especially after he supported Iraq during the Gulf crisis. 
  Regarding this option, al-Bid noted the difficulty in 
achieving it in the light of the tribal and party makeup inside 
Yemen, indicating that the congress party enjoyed wide bases of 
support. But Gore advised him not to pacify the northern 
leaders, emphasizing that the socialist party should abandon 
unity as long as it could not assume power. 
  The second option: Maintaining the secessionist situation 
inside Yemen. 
  In this regard, Gore said that Salih's aim behind unity was 
control of the oilfields in the south and control of strategic 
straits enjoyed by the south Yemen "state." The first step 
Salih would take would be to remove the socialist party from 
power. 
  Although the U.S. vice president submitted these two 
options, 
'Ali Salim al-Bid did not want unity to continue. He only 
wanted to explore the U.S. view in this regard. 
  Gore claimed there was an expected alliance between Yemen 
and 
Iraq, which would lead to the loss of south Yemen's wealth. The 
U.S. vice president gave al-Bid information on Iraqi contacts 
with Yemen and Jordan to revive the idea of the Arab Cooperation 
Council. He submitted false documents on contacts held among the 
three states in this regard. 
  According to the reports, al-Bid emerged from that meeting 
with one impression, namely, the need to abort the unity with 
north Yemen's leaders and to let south Yemen monopolize its oil 
resources. 
  During al-Bid's stay in Washington, a U.S. official gave him 
an important report on huge oil discoveries in Ma'rib and four 
other southern areas. The report noted that south Yemen could 
become an economic giant if it could control its oil resources. 
  After reading the report, al-Bid met Saudi Ambassador in 
Washington Bandar Bin-Sultan and asked him to tell the United 
States of his real desire to secede from north Yemen and of his 
fears of the consequences of secession if he were left alone in 
the battlefield to face the northern forces. 
  Consequently, al-Bid obtained U.S. confirmation that the 
United States would support his military stance and would not 
allow the northern forces to get near Aden. 
  Following al-Bid's return from Washington, President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih asked for a report on his visit but al-Bid 
fabricated a political crisis so as to avoid presenting any 
reports on his Washington visit. 
  During that time, Prince Bandar Bin-Sultan arrived in Saudi 
Arabia on a mission to brief Saudi officials on the outcome of 
al- Bid's talks in Washington. 
  When the crisis escalated, the northerners made many 
concessions for the sake of maintaining Yemeni unity while 
al-Bid engaged in strengthening his ties with Saudi Arabia and 
Kuwait. His deputy, Salim Salih, played a direct role in 
obtaining financial support from Kuwait, which was later used to 
buy weapons for south Yemen. 
  In light of the escalating developments that preceded the 
outbreak of war in Yemen, the United States decided to build the 
largest air base in the Jizan area near the Yemeni border and 
placed the job of preparing it under the supervision of Sultan 
Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, Saudi minister of defense and civil aviation, 
who cut short a visit to Switzerland for treatment and returned 
home to supervise the building of the base. 
  Information indicates that General Schwarzkopf's views were 
sought. He proposed that the base should target Yemen and Iraq 
so as to confront any expansion in the war. 
  These factors were behind the enthusiasm shown by the 
southerners for the war against the legitimate forces. The 
promises they got had an effect on the statements that were made 
during the first days of the war, statements in which they 
threatened to inflict defeat on the northern forces. But the 
Yemeni people's rallying behind their national army thwarted the 
plot of the secessionists and their supporters. This plot is on 
the verge of final collapse under the blows inflicted on it by 
those who believe in the unity of the fraternal Yemeni people.

  [Text] Cairo, 20 Jun (MENA) -- AL-AHRAM and AL-AKHBAR 
assert in their editorials today that the continued fighting in 
Yemen and permitting the language of guns and missiles to gain 
the upper hand over the language of dialogue and reason do not 
pose a danger only to Yemen's unity but also have a negative 
effect on the Islamic and Arab nation. 
  AL-AHRAM writes that a cease-fire in Yemen is a primary and 
indispensable condition for resolving the Yemeni crisis and 
eliminating its causes. It adds that this remains a collective 
Arab and international demand, as UN Envoy to Yemen Lakhdar 
Brahimi declared following his meeting with President Husni 
Mubarak yesterday. 
  The paper goes on to say: Many observers believe that the 
northern forces are primarily responsible for the collapse of 
the efforts to effect a cease-fire. A neutral analysis of the 
current situation confirms that it is in Sanaa's interest now to 
abide fully by the cease-fire. It notes that there are two 
reasons for this; the first is that Sanaa's declared objective 
from the war is to protect unity and the second is that Sanaa's 
military operations in the south have apparently reached the 
limits acceptable at Arab and international, and possibly 
Yemeni, levels. The declared U.S. warning to northern Yemen's 
government not to enter Aden is an expression of this fact. 
  Concluding its editorial, AL-AHRAM expresses its belief that 
there is an impetus emerging to resolve the Yemeni crisis as the 
parties to the conflict have agreed to meet in Cairo following 
Arab and international pressure in order to discuss the 
appropriate mechanism for implementing the UN Security Council's 
cease-fire resolution and ensuring constant compliance with it. 
  In a similar editorial, AL-AKHBAR stresses that the 
continued 
fighting in Yemen despite all the Egyptian and Arab appeals to 
stop the massacres of citizens in the north and the south is the 
epitome of the tragedies that the Arab world is subjected to. 
  The paper then refers to Egypt's repeated declarations from 
the time the crisis began that unity cannot be imposed by force 
. It refers to its rejection right from the start of the 
principle of fighting between the sons of the one homeland, 
regardless of the reasons and causes, including the claims 
advanced by some that the fighting is to protect Yemen's unity. 
  AL-AKHBAR calls on some Arab parties who are involved in 
giving aid to one of the warring parties merely to serve their 
vile intentions to stop doing so immediately so as not to help 
deepen the split in the Arab ranks.

  [Text] A senior spokesman for the Sri Lankan Government 
told LANKAPUVATH yesterday that the fresh peace talks offer made 
by the LTTE [Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam] terrorists 
through the BBC fell far short of the requirements for the 
government to resume negotiations between the government and the 
terrorist organization [words indistinct]. He described the new 
peace talks offer made by the LTTE ideologist, Anton 
Balasingham, to the BBC in Jaffna as an old song with a new 
tune. The only concession the Tigers had made was the 
cease-fire which is tantamount to the laying down of arms, which 
is one of the preconditions laid down by the government. If the 
LTTE was genuinely interested in settling the problem they 
should contact the Sri Lankan Government direct and not use 
intermediaries as ploys. They should inform the government of 
the framework of their proposals. The senior government 
spokesman said that the Sri Lanka Government has a precondition 
also stated that the LTTE leader Prabhakaran should deal direct 
with the government and not through his spokesman and 
intermediaries. In addition, the government requires that all 
political parties should take part in the peace talks. Once 
these preconditions were met, the Sri Lankan Government was 
willing to (?listen) to them resuming negotiations to end the 
crisis and terrorism. 
  Meanwhile, a military spokesman told LANKAPUVATH that 
preparations were being finalized for an all out onslaught which 
would end LTTE terrorism and restore peace in the northeastern 
region.

<F P=106> [Report by Ra'fat Yahya] </F>
  [Text] Islamabad -- Reliable Afghan sources connected with 
the Tajik opposition have told AL-HAYAH that warplanes belonging 
to the Uzbek militias under 'Abdol Rashid Dostam have raided the 
Tajik refugee camps in the Qonduz area in northern Afghanistan. 
The raids took place the day before yesterday and resulted in 
eight killed (most of them women and children) and 12 wounded. 
  The Tajik refugees have come under fire from two sides: the 
Communist government [of Tajikistan] and the Russian forces that 
support it, from one side, and the formerly Communist General 
Dostam's militias, which are considered to be carrying out 
Moscow's plans to eliminate the radicals in the Tajik 
opposition, from the other. 
  This aggression comes at a time when talks are going on in 
Tehran between the Communist Tajik Government and the Islamic 
opposition to reach a cease-fire between the two sides. 
  Informed Tajik sources connected with [the talks] told 
AL-HAYAH that the raid was part of plans that have been carried 
out for some time to force hundreds of thousands of Tajik 
emigrants to leave the Afghan areas adjacent to the borders of 
their country, in view of the fact that the emigrants are a 
source of recruitment for the opposition, besides their being a 
political cover for it. 
  The same sources affirmed that the recent raids have not 
been 
the first of their kind. Dostam's fighters had previously raided 
the emigrant camps several times, killing more than 40 Tajiks 
and wounding 100 others in two of the raids. They indicated that 
the militias also use other means to terrorize the refugees, 
among them poisoning the drinking water in their camps, which 
has caused the death of more than 90 people.

  [Text] Abu Dhabi, June 23 (AFP) -- Lebanon is ready to 
prevent cross-border attacks with Syrian help if Israel 
withdraws its troops from the south, Lebanon's defence minister 
was quoted on Thursday [23 June] as saying. 
  Muhsin Dallul said the government wanted Syrian troops, 
which 
entered in 1976 at the request of the Arab League, to stay in 
Lebanon to help the army in deploying in all parts of the 
country following the end of the civil war. 
  "We need help from the Syrian forces in providing some 
brigades to be sent to the south in case there was an Israeli 
withdrawal from the occupied areas," he told the United Arab 
Emirates daily AL- KHALIJ. 
  "Our relationship with the Syrian forces is strategic in 
this 
respect. There are several areas where we need the support of 
the Syrians. This issue is not for discussion at all because 
the Syrian forces came to Lebanon at an official request and 
their stay is still demanded officially." 
  Israel, which controls a border strip in the south to 
prevent 
cross-border attacks by Palestinian and Lebanese guerrillas, has 
accused the nearly 35,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon of backing 
the guerrillas. 
  It has also called for border security arrangements with 
Lebanon as one of the conditions for quitting the south. 
  "We reject any talk about security arrangements with 
Israel," 
he said. 
  "We are sticking to UN Resolution 425 and we have the 
capability of preventing any infiltration or operation from the 
south against Israel after the implementation of that 
resolution," Dallul said. 
  "But if Israel stayed, then we have a great national 
decision, which considers the attacks against the Israelis in 
the south as legitimate because we are not policemen for 
protecting the occupation. We reject this occupation and 
believe the resistance is carrying out a legitimate and national 
duty, which must continue so long as the occupation stays." 
  Dallul said Israel wanted to destabilise Lebanon to scare 
away tourists, a key hard currency earner for Lebanon. He 
expected Israel to continue attacks on Lebanon but added: "Let 
Israel do whatever it wants. We will not fulfill its wishes and 
we will not stop resistance attacks."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report] </F>
  [Excerpts] Differences have emerged between Hizballah 
Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah and Sayyid Muhammad Husayn 
Fadlallah. The differences came into the open when Hizballah 
held a memorial service in the Southern Suburb for the martyrs 
of the Zionist aggression against Hizballah's camp in 'Ayn 
Kawkab in al-Biqa' and the program did not include a speech by 
Fadlallah. 
  It is worth noting that this was the first time in more than 
10 years that Fadlallah had attended a function without 
delivering a speech. 
  A number of Nasrallah's supporters left a ceremony held by 
the Iranian Embassy on 5 June to mark the anniversary of Imam 
Khomeyni's death when Fadlallah mounted the rostrum to begin a 
speech. 
  It should be recalled that Fadlallah and Nasrallah share the 
loyalty of Hizballah members. But the Hizballah secretary 
general has been trying for more than a year to "purge" the 
party's ranks of the supporters of Fadlallah and the former 
Hizballah secretary general Shaykh Subhi al-Tufayli. 
  Within this framework, Nasrallah has been having his 
supporters distribute a book of remarks about Fadlallah's 
course. He has also been telling his supporters that Shaykh 
Subhi al-Tufayli is responsible for the clashes that took place 
between Hizballah and the Amal Movement. [passage omitted] 
  Nasrallah is currently facing problems with many Iranian 
parties because of the many setbacks Hizballah has suffered 
since Nasrallah assumed the post of secretary general. These 
setbacks--which he suffered among the Shi'ah scholars, party 
members, and the general public--recently forced him to expel 
more than 250 party members for various reasons.

  [Text] Kuwait, 24 Jun (MENA) -- Kuwaiti Interior Minister 
Shaykh 'Ali Sabah al-Salim has said there is full cooperation 
and coordination between Egypt and Kuwait on various issues 
concerning the two countries, especially relating to security. 
He noted that there is continuous consultation among officials. 
  In a statement to MENA, he denied any form of extremism or 
terrorism in Kuwait, be it intellectual or ideological. He 
emphasized that everyone has the right to openly state his view 
within the law and general controls. 
  He said security in Kuwait is very stable and that 
everything 
is now under control. He added that most of the negative 
security aspects that emerged after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait 
have been eliminated. He affirmed that security reports coming 
in from the various sectors indicate that Kuwait now enjoys 
greater security and stability than before. He denied there 
were any human rights violations in Kuwait. 
  He said there are around 180,000 maids from various 
countries 
in Kuwait, who enjoy their full rights. He added that the 
Kuwaiti authorities do not approve of anyone's material or moral 
rights being violated in Kuwait and noted malicious foreign 
media reports trying to damage Kuwait's reputation. 
  He said Kuwait respects and preserves human rights and the 
security and safety of all workers in Kuwait, adding that there 
are around 1 million foreigners from 120 countries working in 
Kuwait and that their rights are respected. 
  Commenting on talk of tension between National Assembly 
deputies and the Kuwaiti Interior Ministry, he said relations 
between ministry officials and the National Assembly are 
proceeding well. He noted that everyone's basic goal is to 
preserve public order and stabilize the situation on every level.

<F P=106> [Interview with 'Abdallah al-Asnaj, "foreign minister of the </F>
Democratic Republic of Yemen," by unidentified correspondent in 
Paris; date not given] 
  [Text] [AL-HAYAH] How would you assess the talks you held 
in Cairo recently? 
  [Al-Asnaj] The meetings held in Cairo, especially those 
concerning the mission of the UN secretary general's special 
envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, were separate meetings with a southern 
delegation that had powers to discuss details of the stages of 
implementing Security Council Resolution 924, and a northern 
delegation that did not have sufficient powers or no powers at 
all. Because the delegation did not represent the authorities 
or the state. It was a partisan delegation from the alliance of 
the General People's Congress and the Reform Grouping. 
  We considered this an attempt by Sanaa to gain time by 
extending Brahimi's mission in the region without achieving any 
progress with regard to a halt to the ongoing war. We informed 
Brahimi of our view and willingness to meet with him at the 
United Nations if the northern side expresses similar 
willingness to engage in serious commitments aimed primarily at 
securing a cease-fire and hence searching for a suitable 
mechanism to ascertain the warring parties' compliance with the 
cease-fire arrangements. 
  We proposed a mechanism whereby a body would supervise the 
cease-fire, in addition to an implementing body to operate on 
the ground and include northern and southern elements together 
with Omani and Jordanian representatives, that is after the 
approval of the two countries' governments. And then work later 
to broaden the scale of Arab participation and form two African 
and Asian groups to work under UN auspices and the supervision 
of its secretary general. I believe that from his visits to 
Sanaa and al-Mukalla Brahimi gathered specific ideas and 
sufficient information to include in the report he is going to 
submit to the secretary general. We will read this report when 
we go to the United Nations at the end of the week, where we 
will meet with [Butrus-] Ghali. 
  [AL-HAYAH] Assuming that Brahimi's report points to Sanaa's 
intransigence, what will the next possible step be? 
  [Al-Asnaj] The war issue in Yemen no longer concerns the 
Yemenis alone. It is a disaster for the Yemenis first. We are 
not a state, nor do we enjoy full rights at the United Nations. 
But there are states concerned with what is happening in Yemen 
and which could -- in the immediate term -- pose a threat to the 
region's security and stability. 
  Ssnaa has on numerous occasions announced a date for a 
cease-fire, but it failed to observe it. We had hoped that it 
would prove its seriousness, specify what it wants, and present 
its view of how the cease-fire can be consolidated to enable 
Brahimi to compare and define common denominators. But Sanaa 
has not specified what it wants or how it understands the 
Security Council resolution. So it is now futile to continue a 
dialogue of the deaf while the fighting continues to escalate, 
especially in Aden, where missiles are being fired at civilian 
targets and causing painful human losses. 
  [AL-HAYAH] What are your expectations as regards future 
events in Yemen? 
  [Al-Asnaj] The northern war machine will reach the point of 
exhaustion by attrition. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has deployed his 
forces over a vast area of land. And most of these forces are 
suffering a great deal, especially as they were stationed 
originally on southern territory. The al-'Amaliqah brigade has 
been in Abyan for four years and has made its arrangements for a 
long stay and adopted the human shield method along Iraqi lines. 
These forces are no longer in a comfortable situation, and I 
believe that they will retreat when they realize that they are 
exhausted -- which will open the door to new Arab and 
international mediations and endeavors to reconcile the two 
parts of Yemen. As for the unity issue, it is settled. We 
cannot preserve unity on the basis of pools of blood and the 
Yemeni people's skulls. A unity that began through dialogue and 
amicably must end through dialogue and amicably, because Sanaa 
is not far from Aden, and vice versa. The possibility of 
establishing relations within another framework, as was the case 
four years ago, can be considered. 
  The brothers in Syria agreed to separate from Iraq and later 
agreed not to establish unity with Iraq for regional reasons, so 
why insist on Yemeni unity? Arab unity has gone through 
numerous experiences, and maybe there was negligence in how to 
establish it, because it is more emotional than practical. 
  [AL-HAYAH] Do you not fear the country's fragmentation? 
  [Al-Asnaj] The war is consolidating the position of 
resistance and steadfastness, and if there were any political 
collapses inside the country, the situation would have been 
different.

  [Text] Officials in Aden called on the United Nations to 
impose sanctions on the government of Sanaa to lift the siege it 
was imposing on Aden. 
  Anis Yahiya, head of the south Yemeni delegation touring 
Western Europe and the United States, said in a news conference 
he held in London that the threat of imposing sanctions was the 
only means to stop the northern bombardment of Aden. 
  He added that the sanctions would force Yemeni President 
'Ali 
'Abdullah Salih to comply with UN Security Council Resolution 
No. 924, which called for a cease-fire in Yemen. 
  That came at a time when the intensity of the continued 
northern shelling of Aden and its suburbs had increased. 
  A southern communique affirmed that the northern shelling 
had 
caused the death and wounding of 800 people since 17 June 
instant. [passage omitted] 
  An official in Aden said that the main plant for generating 
electricity was subjected to an aerial and artillery bombardment 
by the northern forces, a matter which led to a power supply cut 
in Aden and caused heavy losses to the plant.

<F P=106> [Report by Maher Chmaytelli] </F>
  [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 23 (AFP) -- Fighting on frontlines 
around Aden and northern attacks on the city left 30 people dead 
and nearly 150 others wounded Thursday [23 June], and the south 
appealed for foreign intervention to break the stranglehold. 
  The bombardments began at dawn, continued through the day 
and 
were still in progress as night fell. Twenty-two civilians were 
killed and around 100 wounded as Katyusha rockets slammed into 
the city's northern suburbs and shells hit the city centre, 
officials at Aden's main hospital said. 
  Fierce fighting on the north and northwestern fronts left 
eight soldiers dead and 48 wounded when northern troops launched 
two offensives, according to the city's other hospitals. 
Wounded taken to the main hospital had to be treated in the 
corridors because of lack of space, while weeping relatives 
crowded the courtyard. 
  A spokesman for the breakaway Yemen Democratic Republic said 
on Aden Radio: "Following renewed, blind bombardments by the 
north of Aden, we urgently call on the international community 
to impose a ceasefire by force." He appealed for northern 
troops loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih to be forced to 
withdraw from the south and to be treated as war criminals. 
  Aden Radio called on the town's citizens to "join in the 
defence," assuring them there had been no breakthrough by 
northern forces, while television read out an army communique 
indicating "resistance operations" within territory held by 
northern forces. The army statement said 47 northern troops had 
been killed in the previous 48 hours during two "resistance" 
operations in the Lahij region, some 100 kilometres (60 miles) 
north of Aden. 
  Military sources here said the north had managed to seize 
the 
entrance to the town of Bi'r Ahmad, 15 kilometres (nine miles) 
northwest of Aden, close to one of the city's three power 
stations. The plant was hit by eight Katyushas, causing a fire 
in fuel pipelines and resulting in a partial shutdown and power 
cuts in several Aden districts. A cloud of dust and sand hung 
over Bi'r Ahmad caused by explosions as a Toyota car, with a 
siren blaring, scoured the area picking up dead and wounded 
soldiers. 
  Electricity was restored to many districts in the city after 
a power cut caused by a rocket attack on the Hiswah power plant, 
west of Aden. 
  On the northern front the battle raged for control of the 
pumping station at Bi'r Nasir which provides Aden's drinking 
water supplies. 
  Two shells hit the fish market at Ma'allah on the sea front 
and a salvo of Kaytusha rockets destroyed five houses in the 
working class district of Mansurah. Shells fell on Aden at the 
rate of two or three a minute and the Khormaksar district near 
the airport and northern suburbs near the front were also hit. 
  Southern leaders said in a statement that 800 civilians had 
been killed or wounded by northern attacks on Aden and its 
suburbs since June 17. 
  Salih and southerners backing his rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid 
have been locked in civil war for almost two months. 
  "The Sanaa regime is continuing to defy the international 
community," the statement added, referring to a UN Security 
Council resolution adopted on June 1 calling for an immediate 
ceasefire and the start of talks. 
  The north's Planning Minister 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani is en 
route for Washington where he is to meet with UN Secretary 
General Butros Butros-Ghali to discuss the war which broke out 
on May 5. Al-Iryani will also meet UN special envoy Lakhdar 
Brahimi who failed to broker a truce during a 10-day tour of the 
region, the official SABA' agency said. 
  The north demands that the south renounce its May 21 
declaration of a separate state before entering talks. 
  The minister, scheduled to hold talks in Washington with 
U.S. 
State Department officials, will discuss the "means to apply UN 
Resolution 924 in the context of Yemeni unity," the agency said. 
  The war shattered four years of uneasy union between the 
former Marxist South Yemen and conservative, tribal North Yemen. 
  Meanwhile in Cairo, Russian Ambassador Vladimir Polyakov 
said 
any recognition by Russia of the breakaway state would depend on 
the findings of Brahimi's report.

<F P=106> [Report by Suleiman Nimr] </F>
  [Text] Zinjibar, Yemen, June 24 (AFP) -- Northern troops 
are marking time on fronts around the besieged southern Yemeni 
city of Aden, an AFP correspondent reported late Thursday [23 
June] from the frontline. 
  "For two weeks now we have not moved a metre," said Colonel 
'Ali Salim Muhammad of the 17th Brigade stationed here, 20 
kilometres (12 miles) east of Aden. "We could easily enter 
Aden, but we are waiting for the order from political leaders in 
Sanaa," the colonel added. "For the time being, we make do with 
bombarding military targets in Aden, especially the military 
camp at Khor Maksar." 
  Aden hospital sources earlier reported that 30 people had 
been killed Thursday and nearly 150 wounded as north Yemeni 
gunners shelled the southern stronghold, prompting the south to 
appeal for foreign intervention to break the stranglehold. The 
bombardment began at dawn, continued through the day and was 
still in progress as night fell. 
  Fierce fighting on the north and northwestern fronts 
meanwhile left eight soldiers dead and 48 wounded after northern 
troops launched two offensives, according to the city's other 
hospitals. The north's second lieutenant, Mujahid 'Ali Husayn, 
meanwhile said northern troops had moved some two kilometres 
(one mile) forward on Saturday [25 June], after repulsing a 
"desperate counter-attack by (southern) secessionists." 
  Colonel 'Ali Shaykh 'Umar, commanding officer in Abyan 25 
kilometres (16 miles) east of Aden, admitted that "northern fire 
has hit civilians by mistake," but said that was "very rare." 
Since northern troops launched their unrelenting assualt on the 
port a week ago 108 civilians have been killed and 387 wounded, 
according to hospital officials. 
  Northern troops listened to patriotic songs played over a 
loud-speaker mounted on a military vehicle as they fired shells 
on Aden. But the songs did not drown out the explosions of 
shells fired by the south's heavy artillery from the besieged 
city. 
  Southern shells fell sporadically into the desert near the 
brigade's positions, and southern warplanes buzzed Abyan 
regularly, flying high to avoid northern anti-aircraft fire. 
Burned-out remains of northern troop-carriers, destroyed in 
southern air raids, were strewn around the dusty Al-Aslam region 
some 15 kilometres (nine miles) from Aden. But northern 
soldiers were visibly relaxed in the scorching sun, as they 
washed themselves with scalding water from an enormous tank 
mounted on a rickety lorry. 
  War broke out between northern forces loyal to President 
'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih and those of his southern rival 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid on May 5. So far, all attempts to mediate a ceasefire 
have failed.

    [Editorial Report] Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Arabic, in a 
special "With the Events" program, carries from 1438-1614 GMT a 
live or recorded phone-in program with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, 
"official in charge of the planning and international 
cooperation file in the Palestinian authority," who received 
phone calls in a "temporary studio" set up at the Palestine 
Hotel in Gaza. The phone-in program is interrupted by a news 
summary at 1530 GMT. Sha'th answers questions by the program 
moderators and callers on various domestic and personal issues, 
especially concerning prisoners and deportees. The program is 
moderated by Roset Hakim in Jerusalem and Hasan Abu- Zayid Sa'id 
and Mu'addi in the studio in Gaza. 
  Answering a question by a caller from Hebron on rumors about 
Hebron being handed to the Palestinian authority early July, 
Nabil Sha'th says that according to the Palestinian-Israeli 
Declaration of Principles [DOP] signed in Washington, 13 July 
was the date set for the start of self-rule in the entire West 
Bank. He says that there has been some delay, but he expects 
that "if intentions are sincere and if the required effort is 
made, all cities of the West Bank will be included within the 
framework of the Palestinian authority and self-rule" three 
months from now. 
  Asked by Hasan Abu-Zayid on the date of PLO Chairman Yasir 
'Arafat's arrival in the self-rule area, Nabil Sha'th says: 
"Abu-Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] always keeps his travel secret and 
surprising. Undoubtedly, he will declare the date of his 
arrival a few days earlier so that all preparations are made. 
However, we should not forget that President 'Arafat is the 
president of all Palestinians. Consequently, he has 
responsibilities outside Palestine toward the Palestinians 
living abroad. He will be also responsible for the situation of 
PLO institutions after his return to the homeland. He has to 
settle many matters before he returns to Gaza and Jericho. 
Also, some preparations must be made in Gaza and Jericho, such 
as, among other things, completing the implementation of the 
agreement and putting the security measures into practice. I 
have always said that I expect 'Arafat to arrive before the end 
of this month. This could be the case, but if any delay takes 
place, it will not be for much longer." 
  Asked by a caller from Gaza on employees' salaries and the 
economic situation, Sha'th says that "the Palestinian authority 
wants to continue to offer the required services to citizens, 
including education, health, sewerage system, illuminating 
streets, protecting beaches, and other similar matters. All 
this, including security, needs taxes to make them possible. 
Now we are fully responsible for security. This requires 
salaries for the police and others. We will receive 
international aid in the first year. This aid will enable us to 
offer services before we manage to collect the taxes needed for 
that. We will seriously discuss the possibility of increasing 
salaries. I asked brother Abu-Shar'iah, who is responsible for 
personnel affairs at the civil administration, to draw a plan 
for increasing the salaries of government employees so as to 
bring them close to the salaries paid to United National Relief 
and Works Agency and private sector employees." 
  Asked by Roset Hakim whether the Palestinian police will 
exert efforts to capture the killers of a Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] activist, who was killed in Bayt Lahiya on 
22 June, Sha'th says: "Definitely. We will not allow any 
killer, assailant, or thief to escape punishment. This is not 
because we want to take revenge on anybody, but to give all 
citizens a feeling of justice and security irrespective of their 
political affiliation and geographic locations." 
  Asked by Hakim whether he is holding contacts with 
representatives of the Palestinian opposition to learn about 
their stand on the peace process and the possibility of their 
participation in future self-rule elections, Sha'th says: "I 
will be holding such contacts very soon. I started by resolving 
the problems facing the police and the civil authority through 
cooperation with my colleagues and brothers. I am visiting 
professional Palestinian communities--workers, merchants, and 
others. I know that some of my colleagues are in constant 
contact with the opposition. I will gladly hold contacts with 
them to achieve a genuine peace, national unity, democracy, and 
participation by all. In light of peace and the agreements that 
we have signed, we want to give everybody a chance to take part 
in building their homeland and future." 
  A telephone call was also received from Dr. Mahmud 
al-Zahhar, 
a Hamas leader in Gaza. In a brief dialogue, Sha'th and 
al-Zahhar exchange greetings and hope to meet soon. Al-Zahhar 
says: "First, we beseech God Almighty to grant you and your 
brothers here success. You are all welcome to your homeland. We 
beseech God that your presence here will be beneficial for the 
homeland and will spare us harm and evil, signs of which are 
evident through the agents' escalation of their activity against 
honorable persons of various affiliations. This has resulted in 
the martyrdom of youth Nasir Salluha. This is extremely 
regrettable. We hope that the police will not take its role 
fully to establish justice and to put an end to those agents." 
  Sha'th responds: "I wholeheartedly support you, brother 
Mahmud. We will not relinquish our responsibility. Defending 
you and all those affiliated to your organization and all the 
children of those people who struggled and paid sacrifices to 
achieve genuine security, effective participation, and justice 
is a responsibility which we are assuming without hesitation." 
  Asked to comment on some Palestinian prisoners' intention to 
receive 'Arafat upon his arrival in the self-rule area with 
black flags, Sha'th says that Palestinian prisoners have 
suffered a great deal from prisons and that peace has not 
secured their release although they had a role in the start of 
the peace process. He says that Palestinian officials are 
sparing no effort to secure their release. He says that the 
Cairo agreement has created the mechanism for the release of all 
prisoners, noting that special arrangements and negotiations are 
still needed. 
  Asked by Hasan Abu-Zayid on Jerusalem and recent statements 
by Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political Department, on a 
Palestinian-Israeli "secret file concerning Jerusalem," and 
whether a "new media clamor" about Jerusalem is imminent, Nabil 
Sha'th says: "I do not believe that what is required is a media 
clamor. What is required are clear bases for action regarding 
the issue of Jerusalem. I believe that brother Abu-al-Lutf 
[Faruq Qaddumi] also refers to Holst's message, which 
constitutes a part of the overall Oslo accords. I remind the 
brother listeners that among the Oslo accords were the DOP which 
was signed in Washington, the letters exchanged between 
President 'Aaraft and Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin on mutual 
recognition between the PLO and Israel, and this message by 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres to Holst, the late Norwegian 
foreign minister. What is required is for everyone of us to 
realize what these bases are. First, the final status of 
Jerusalem will be decided by the agreement that will result from 
the negotiations on the final status. These negotiations will 
begin within a period not exceeding two years after the signing 
of the DOP. The agreement will be implemented within a period 
not exceeding five years, which is the transitional period -- 
three years after the first two years. However, the 
implementation of the DOP on the final status of Jerusalem is 
based on the implementation of Resolutions 242 and 338. In 
other words, Jerusalem is considered an occupied city. It is 
not an annexed city, but a city like other cities in the West 
bank and Gaza occupied in 1967. Until we arrive at the final 
status, every side has its declared objectives. Our declared 
objective is that in the final status, we want East Jerusalem to 
be the capital of an independent Palestinian state. As for the 
relationship between east and west Jerusalem, this is a topic of 
negotiation. We do not want a new Berlin wall between east and 
west Jerusalem. This is something that will be decided in the 
negotiations. Until we arrive at this situation, our rights in 
east Jerusalem must be maintained. We must not be prevented 
from entering Jerusalem and the Palestinian civilian and 
religious institutions in the city must be defended. The 
Israeli Government must not take any measures preventing 
citizens' freedom and rights in Jerusalem. This is our 
position, and this is what has been achieved by Holst's message. 
What is required is abidance by this agreement rather to be 
engaged in media rows about it." 
  Asked by Abu-Zayid on the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations 
that will start on 27 June, Sha'th says that the first topic on 
the agenda will be drawing timetables for the release of 
remainder of Palestinian prisoners. He says that the 
negotiations will deal with issues not included in the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement and deployment of Palestinian authority 
and police throughout the West Bank in preparation for Israeli 
withdrawal from cities and villages and in preparation for the 
elections which will be held when withdrawal is completed. He 
says that those negotiations will "most probably" be held in 
Gaza and Israel.

  [Text] Leader President Saddam Husayn, may God protect and 
preserve him, has chaired a Cabinet meeting. The Cabinet 
discussed, within the course charted by his excellency for its 
actions and discussions, subjects related to improving 
production, efficient performance, flexibility and quick 
response in the administrative field, and fairness and balance 
between duties and rights. 
  The Cabinet discussed a plan to produce and improve seeds, 
executed by al-Iba' Agricultural Research Center, which this 
year achieved self-sufficiency in the production of potato seeds 
and is seeking to achieve self-sufficiency in the production of 
seeds for some vegetables and legumes. The Cabinet decided to 
support al-Iba' Center with the necessary financial funds to 
maintain the link between the center and potato growers. 
  The Cabinet also discussed the situation of the cooperative 
movement in the country, its structures, and the proposals made 
to develop it. In this regard, the leader president, may God 
protect him, stressed the need for discussing how the 
cooperative societies can develop their own resources and not 
turn to state support except in emergency cases. He said we 
must distinguish between incorrect implementations and the lack 
of correct or fair programs. The cooperative movement, he said, 
must play its role among the people within the concept of 
cooperation. 
  His excellency urged the ministers, saying: When you propose 
a law or an amendment to a law, your main concern must be how 
this law or amendment will achieve justice and how will it take 
into consideration the interests of all people in a fair way. 
Any law that ignores this basic aspect or includes an 
accumulation of forbidden things, particularly the unnecessary 
ones, will help create a trend to violate it. The application 
of a fair law, in which obligations and rights are balanced and 
clear, will not only achieve justice, but will also ease the 
pressure on courts. 
  His excellency said: We must also take note that certain 
policies and laws are right in certain circumstances. But when 
the circumstances change, we must set a new policy, a course, 
and legislation must correspond to our new circumstances instead 
of harming the citizen and the state and not achieving the 
justice required by the new circumstance. 
  His excellency added: Each minister must review the laws 
within the context of this course, which will make one take 
pride in the state and belonging to it. Proposals to consider 
these laws must be made. We still have work to build upon and 
we can do this as quickly as we can.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by </F>
Itay Engel and Mikhal Gazit; place not given -- live] 
  [Text] [Engel] We would like to speak with the prime 
minister on the occasion of the second anniversary of the Rabin 
government. Good morning, Mr. Yitzhaq Rabin. 
  [Rabin] Good morning to you and to the listeners. 
  [Engel] Sir, two years ago you spoke about the need to 
change the national order of priorities. If not a top priority, 
at least the most talked about issue at the moment is Syria. 
You warned yesterday about what might befall us if a peace 
agreement is not reached with the Syrians. We would like to 
hear from you this morning about what is happening in reality 
rather than about what might happen. Do you foresee a 
development on the Syrian channel in the next few weeks? 
  [Rabin] I believe the dialogue with Syria will continue. I 
am sorry, though, that it will continue indirectly, through the 
Americans, in a bid to reach a direct dialogue. I doubt that 
the Syrians are currently ready for any other form of contacts, 
which would be the best way to advance the political process. 
  [Gazit] Sir, having said that, you uttered very harsh words 
yesterday about Syria and the possibility of war within a few 
years if there is no change in the situation. Should we infer 
from it that the Syrian channel is still stuck and going nowhere? 
  [Rabin] The problem is not that we want war. We want peace, 
and in order to attain it, we are prepared to make painful 
compromises. At the same time, I am sorry to hear that in an 
address to the Zionist Executive, a Likud leader asserted that 
the Arab world no longer has a military option. This is an 
illusion. We had better learn from our bitter experience: Three 
months before the Six-Day War, nobody thought there would be a 
war in 1967; two weeks before the Yom Kippur War, nobody thought 
there would be a war. Those who think a military option no 
longer exists have no right to apply for the generous U.S. aid 
and should not put everything into building up the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] in order to have a strong army. Although we 
must first and foremost prevent a war, if it is forced on us, we 
must win it. 
  The government's policy, therefore, is to search for any 
possible way to attain peace from a position of strength and by 
nurturing Israel's military might, which is a condition for its 
existence and the security of its population. This is also the 
condition for peace, because nobody will negotiate with a 
militarily weak Israel. That is why we act on both levels. 
  Two years ago today, Labor emerged from the elections to the 
13th Knesset as the largest party in Israel. The factions 
affiliated with it in the Knesset constitute a buffer against 
the establishment of another government, even if all the 
right-wing and religious parties were to unite. Moreover, we 
changed the national order of priorities. We stopped throwing 
money away on the political settlements in the territories and 
transferred it to education. The education budget was augmented 
by an amount unprecedented in the past 15 years, because 
education is the key to the future of our sons, the future of 
the young generation, and the future of the State of Israel. We 
invested in the transportation infrastructure in order to make 
up for 25 years of neglect. Israel lagged behind every modern 
country in terms of its transportation infrastructure. Without 
such an infrastructure, it will be impossible to bring the Negev 
and the Galilee closer to the center of the country. The 
problem is not bringing Ari'el closer to the center of Israel, 
because it is already close geographically. The issue is 
expanding and developing the Galilee and the Negev. 
  We fought unemployment. When we assumed power two years ago, 
the rate of unemployment among Soviet immigrants stood at 29 
percent, while in May 1994 it was 14 percent. General 
unemployment in Israel totaled 11.2 percent two years ago and 
8.2 percent in May 1994 -- a 3-percent decrease. We are almost 
back to the level that existed prior to the wave of immigration 
that started in 1989. 
  [Engel] Sir, is there anything you regret, any 
disappointing moments in the past two years? 
  [Rabin] There always are unpleasant moments, but when I look 
at the general picture, I would say that we scored many 
achievements. This does not mean that we achieved everything. 
If there is anything I regret, it is the enormous gap between 
what has actually been achieved by the government and the way 
this is being perceived by the people, either through the media 
or the feeling among various sectors of the population. I think 
this government will bring about reforms, new approaches, and an 
organizational restructuring of many spheres of life in Israel. 
  [Gazit] Sir, you may be reaping the fruit of the I-will-lead 
government [alluding to Rabin's victory speech in June 1992] in 
the political sphere, but you are paying a very high price in 
the domestic arena. Your party is experiencing a very serious 
crisis. Do you think there is room for reaching any conclusions? 
Should we expect a more serene and reconciled second half? 
  [Rabin] I hope so. I am not blaming anybody, except some of 
our institutions, which worked in a certain way for many years; 
I am primarily referring to the Histadrut labor federation. By 
not voting for us as they did in the past, the people seemingly 
wanted to teach us a very painful lesson. Lessons must be 
learned from such a blow. It is a pity that instead of 
everybody learning their lesson, there is bickering. We will 
learn our lesson and rectify what can be rectified. 
  [Engel] Your party colleagues talk about an erosion in your 
standing and a drop in the government's popularity. What is 
your response to this? 
  [Rabin] I was given a mandate in the Knesset elections. I 
have no doubt that the results of the Labor's primaries, which 
determined that I should lead the list, brought about a result 
Labor was not able to obtain in 17 years. I will not judge our 
policy and its implementation according to weekly, monthly, or 
bimonthly public opinion polls. My criteria is what we will 
achieve in our term, in our full four years in power, and not 
the transient moods reflected in public opinion polls. The 
voters will test us in the next scheduled elections. We will be 
judged in the next Knesset elections, which will be held as 
scheduled. 
  [Engel] Sir, thank you very much for this interview. 
  [Rabin] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Interview with King Husayn by Hisham Milhim in Washington; </F>
date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Milhim] Your Majesty: Your meeting with President 
Bill Clinton was the first since the recent Jordanian-Israeli 
agreement and the first since the disagreement on resolving the 
inspection measures at the al-'Aqabah Port. What do you expect 
now from the United States regarding bilateral ties and the 
peace process? Can we say that there will be greater 
concentration now on bilateral ties? Did you discuss, in this 
context, the issue of Jordan getting new economic aid from 
Washington or exempting Jordan from repaying some of its old 
military and nonmilitary loans? 
  [Husayn] As a matter of fact, we raised all of these issues 
with our friends in the United States during the visit. We hope 
they will play a great role in the coming stage to help Jordan 
overcome the difficult situation it is experiencing, 
particularly in the economic field and the debts, whether by 
postponing the repayment or easing the burden or writing off the 
debt in the future. On the bilateral level, there is a joint 
U.S.-Jordanian committee. We hope this committee will serve as 
a mechanism to promote relations in the future in all fields of 
importance to us and them. 
  [Milhim] Have you found understanding in the United States 
of Jordan's economic situation and a willingness to support you? 
  [Husayn] We sensed understanding of our situation and needs. 
At the same time, we believe there is a positive U.S. attitude 
now and regarding the future to support Jordan more with regard 
to its march to provide the needs of the human being, the most 
important element in its existence now and in the future, 
especially if a comprehensive peace is achieved, as we hope. 
  [Milhim] In light of the recent Jordanian-Israeli agreement, 
did you ask President Clinton that Washington continue or 
develop its role in the peace process, particularly since 
President Clinton has pointed out the need to achieve 
comprehensive peace? 
  [Husayn] There is no doubt that the U.S. role as a sponsor 
of the peaceful march is important. The U.S. contributions have 
so far made it possible for the talks to reach this point. We 
will begin -- and we hope this will take place next month -- a 
long, arduous phase of serious negotiations to tackle all the 
items on the agenda that was agreed upon and ratified here in 
Washington immediately after the Palestinian-Israeli agreement. 
We hope that all these issues will be addressed satisfactorily 
toward a comprehensive and just peace. We now feel that it is 
our duty to pay attention to our own concerns regarding the 
present and future of Jordan, because the existence of Jordan, 
apart from any other consideration, we believe, is the right of 
all its sons of all origins. Therefore, we have a national and 
pan-Arab mission in preserving a strong, constant Jordan in the 
region at present and in the future to play the role we have 
always played in the Middle East. 
  [Milhim] The recent Jordanian-Israeli agreement came as a 
surprise to some observers. What are the factors that led to 
the agreement, especially the timing? Is it true that Jordan is 
worried that it will lag behind other tracks, especially the 
Palestinian track? 
  [Husayn] The fact is that these questions about the timing 
are not justified. This is because after endorsing the agenda, 
we were supposed to begin immediately. If there was some delay, 
it was due to other incidents and concerns of other concerned 
parties in the region. When we saw a chance to begin to discuss 
the agenda that was signed some time ago, we welcomed this and 
preferred to see negotiations move to the region in particular, 
especially since one of the most important issues that must be 
discussed is Jordanian sovereignty over Jordanian territories, 
and returning and recognizing these territories in full. There 
is also the question of waters, the environment, and other 
issues. This requires that the meetings be held in the region 
itself so as to define these dimensions and address their 
requirements. As for Jordan's position, I once again reiterate 
with pride that Jordan has been, since its inception, the 
closest to the Palestinian cause, in terms of the people, the 
land, and the rights. Perhaps that has been our destiny as a 
family. We are proud of belonging to Jordan, since the Great 
Arab Revolt. We have offered a great deal and considered the 
cause one of destiny and future to us under all circumstances. 
However, Sir, in practical terms, regarding the recent years 
after 1967, we fought the battle along with our brothers, led by 
Egypt, as a reaffirmation of our Arab commitment to the 
Collective Defense Pact and our belonging to the Arab League. 
At a later stage, our brothers in Egypt chose to walk the path 
of peace. They were the leaders in 1967. After that, the 
Palestinian brothers, who are primarily concerned with this 
affair, decided to step forward and assume their 
responsibilities in looking for this right on their national 
soil. It was unreasonable for Jordan to lag behind or to wait 
for everybody else to address their own issues. Jordan, 
regrettably, has no support except from God Almighty in the 
region. Jordan has no support or backing from any superpowers, 
not even any countries in the region. For the sake of 
Palestine, the cause and the people, on the Palestinian national 
soil, and for the sake of the Arab nation and the defense of the 
depth of the Arab nation, Jordan must stay and continue. And it 
must be an example, not only with regard to political issues but 
also regarding many issues and problems which we face in our 
Arab nation, as well as in its democratic approach, respect for 
human rights, and political pluralism. At the same time, it 
must be a solid rock in the region. All circumstances, 
therefore, require that Jordan continue the quest. We are at 
the beginning of a long and arduous phase of negotiations. 
Whether we are going to succeed or not depends on the Israeli 
side, because we are not seeking peace at any cost. We are 
looking for a just, honorable, and lasting peace and for our 
people's right to live and dream. 
  [Milhim] Damascus reactions to the Jordanian-Israeli 
agreement were critical. It was alleged that Jordan renounced 
coordination with Syria, especially in light of your recent 
visit to Damascus. Can you explain to us your concept of the 
nature of the understanding which you reached with President 
Hafiz al-Asad? What is your opinion about the Syrian attitude? 
  [Husayn] In fact, I was surprised by the Syrian reaction. I 
have not heard anything from His Excellency brother Hafiz 
al-Asad on the personal level. We have been in continuous 
contact until the latest stage. I paid a visit to Damascus, we 
met, and we discussed all issues. Therefore, I believe the 
political dimension concerning the Middle East issues, as well 
as our decisive and pan-Arab issues, will be tackled on our 
level, myself and my brother the president. 
  Regarding the coordination in general, we used this term and 
did our utmost to achieve it. I am not here dealing with this 
issue in light of the recent Syrian stand, but in light of its 
basis, namely, the Jordanian-Palestinian situation. Our issues 
and interests are interlinked. So, we should be together in 
confronting the dangers facing us. Coordination in the full 
sense of the word has not been achieved yet on any level. Every 
now and then we ask the brothers how far they have gone in their 
talks, or we tell them where we are, if they ask. 
  Our brothers in Syria have their own definite and known 
problems concerning the occupied Syrian territory. We have our 
own problems. Coordination has not reached the level of minor 
details. They, in Syria, can afford to wait in light of their 
circumstances, situation, and potentials. However, our issue 
and its interlinkage with the Palestinian issue made us discuss 
this issue. Jordan, Syria, the Palestinian brothers, and 
Lebanon started from the same point in Madrid. We are seeking a 
comprehensive peace. This, however, does not mean we 
relinquished our right to address our issues. We also do not 
assume that Syria will relinquish its right to address its 
issues. Neither do we assume that Syria should relinquish its 
rights to deal with its problems. We coordinate, if that is the 
word, concerning issues that we must coordinate about; that is, 
issues that we and they agree to coordinate on. However, 
practically, coordination in the sense I meant, talked about, or 
searched for was really talk devoid of substance, save our 
endeavors to reach a comprehensive and just peace acceptable to 
future generations. 
  [Milhim] Is the absence of Arab coordination caused by the 
requirements of sovereignty or is it caused by political 
differences, apprehension, or basic lack of trust between 
certain parties concerned? Coordination is like a group dance 
and it seems that some participants are accusing others of not 
moving to the agreed tunes. 
  [Husayn] Let me be frank on this point. We cannot say to the 
Arab people that there is coordination when there is no such 
thing and then surprise them with what is happening. The 
Jordanian-Syrian coordination which was planned to be a 
Syrian-Jordanian meeting on the level of the heads of the 
governments is on another dimension. It is connected with 
efforts to realize some integration, dealing with the 
Syrian-Jordanian family relations, if we can use this term. It 
was hoped that issues would develop concerning Lebanon. Such a 
meeting was held with Egypt so that we could gather together and 
begin to proceed toward the conditions which we wish. This was 
postponed at the wish of our Syrian brothers and we hope the 
postponement will not be for long. 
  [Milhim] Does this mean that the Jordanian-Syrian relations 
have entered a period of coolness? Do you intend to contain the 
situation? 
  [Husayn] [Words indistinct] problem concerning us and I do 
not believe that there is a problem with the Syrian brothers. 
We have remained in contact and together we suffered much 
throughout a very long journey. Brother President al-Asad knows 
me very well and I know him and our relationship is built on 
sincerity and truthfulness. 
  [Milhim] Recently, you also lamented lack of coordination 
with the PLO. How do you describe the relationship between you 
and the PLO now? 
  [Husayn] A good relationship. We supported the PLO from the 
beginning and we addressed the Palestinian people as a whole and 
called on them to be cohesive and crystallize their ideas and 
ambitions through their cohesion, because the most dangerous 
thing is to break up in this critical phase. We also discuss 
the economic dimension. There is a Jordanian-Palestinian 
agreement followed by a Palestinian-Israeli agreement. Now we 
need a Jordanian-Palestinian- Israeli meeting to review all that 
happened and see where we might reach. Had there been 
coordination and a joint Palestinian- Jordanian stand from the 
beginning, we would have taken a short cut and perhaps realized 
more than what we have realized so far. Therefore, our position 
in the future will be to respond to any Palestinian appeal to us 
and help them in any way, one problem at a time because in the 
absence of real coordination, there could be integration in 
stands, this is the only choice. 
  [Milhim] Your Majesty can we imagine the Jordanian-Israeli 
negotiations in the coming months taking an advanced phase 
leading to signing a peace agreement even if no progress is 
realized on other tracks? This is what we understand from your 
statements. 
  [Husayn] It is very difficult to say how issues will develop 
but there is no reason why we should not have progress on all 
tracks so that all of us will reach the cherished goal and 
realize a just and comprehensive peace. 
  [Milhim] Five years ago you began the process of 
democratization and the expansion of the political base which 
led to the formation of parties and holding elections and other 
steps in this regard. Looking back, how would you evaluate the 
past phase? What were the most significant developments and 
what are the disappointments? Do you think that there should be 
a critical evaluation of what took place in the outgoing phase? 
  [Husayn] Critical revision is necessary all the time in the 
life of any people. I believe that this applies to us in 
Jordan, but the democratic choice and the participation of the 
Jordanians, regardless of their origins, in making their 
presence and future is an indispensable basis, in addition to 
the political pluralism and respect for human rights. Arab 
people need to feel--and I hope that the Jordanians now feel 
this--that they are not frustrated, that they are not shunned, 
that their rights and dignity are preserved, and that they 
practically and dynamically contribute to making their present 
and future. I believe that through this march, which could not 
resume except after the disengagement of administrative and 
legal connections with the West Bank, which was followed by the 
PLO's acceptance of Resolution 242 until we reached the present 
conditions--I say that through this march, which proceeded in 
very difficult circumstances and in the face of most dangerous 
challenges in the region, we have found ourselves stronger than 
we have ever been despite the continuous pressures and the 
difficulties which we are suffering. 
  [Milhim] Your Majesty: Prior to the outbreak of war in 
Yemen, Jordan contributed to the attempts to arrive at a 
political settlement. However, the explosion took place. How 
do you assess the situation in Yemen and the future of Yemen? 
What do the events in Yemen mean with respect to the absence of 
an Arab authority or Arab mechanism to prevent similar 
explosions in Arab states? 
  [Husayn] I believe that this situation or any similar tragic 
situation in the Arab homeland should be tackled within an Arab 
context. Therefore, we had responded to the brothers' appeal 
and tried the impossible for months to arrive at the accord that 
was signed in Amman. Representatives of the entire Yemeni 
people and all forces in Yemen without exception attended the 
signing ceremony and signed the accord. We had high hopes that 
that event would be a turning point. However, we were soon 
surprised by the consecutive explosions. At the beginning, we 
tried, through a Jordanian team and a fraternal Omani team both 
working as one team, to stop the deterioration. We were 
successful to a great extent. Later, the picture became broader 
in terms of participation by other brothers and various sides. 
In fact, we discovered that we could not continue our mission 
with respect to the military aspect of the Yemeni agreement. 
This is because unless there is political will, it would be 
difficult to continue the process of unifying the army and the 
Armed Forces. This was supposed to take place at the beginning 
of the unity. However, our brothers' efforts were negatively 
affected for a while after the Gulf crisis. Besides, we were 
all too preoccupied to perform our duty toward them in terms of 
providing advice to help them at that time. Therefore, we 
withdrew the military team, and so did Oman. Afterward, matters 
proceeded toward an explosion. We have a Jordanian medical team 
there doing its best on the humanitarian level. We still hope 
that those Yemeni figures who met in Amman as representatives of 
entire Yemen and its areas, political movements, and people will 
have the ability, just as they had the ability to meet in Amman, 
to maintain Yemeni unity and to create the logic and ability to 
accept even a small portion of the human and material losses on 
the Yemeni area, so that partition could be avoided, for, God 
forbid, Yemen could be partitioned even into more than south and 
north. We have always been supportive of a unified, modern, 
democratic, and strong Yemen to take its place in the Arab 
world. I do not know what the motives and reasons are, but, 
regrettably, it seems that many elements in the Arab world seek 
a future fragmentation, thus leading to potential dangers and 
disasters throughout the entire Arab world. We will not hesitate 
to undertake any effort for the sake of our brothers in Yemen.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Velayati, speaking before a 
gathering of ambassadors, charges d'affaires, and diplomatic 
representatives of foreign countries in Tehran today, said that 
the double-standard of some countries regarding the ominous 
phenomenon of terrorism is an encouragement to the continuation 
of organized crime. 
  According to a report by our correspondent, the foreign 
minister of the Islamic Republic of Iran, referring to the 
recent horrific crime by the hypocrites added: This catastrophe 
is so profound that no free-minded human being can regard it 
with indifference. 
  Velayati described the crime as similar to the one in Hebron 
in the occupied Palestine and said: Such terrorist acts against 
the great nation of Iran will never shake the determination of 
our people in confronting criminals. 
  Our country's foreign minister also called on the 
international community to confront the ominous phenomenon of 
terrorism decisively and without a selective approach. 
  He regretted some of the foreign states' support for the 
hypocrites' terrorist group and letting them put propaganda 
means at their disposal. He added: Without such support the 
bloody catastrophe in Mashhad would not have happened. 
  According to the same report, after the statement made by 
our 
country's foreign minister, the Libyan ambassador in Tehran, as 
the doyen of ambassadors, expressed regret over that traumatic 
incident and considered that terrorist act as a violation of 
human rights.

  [Excerpts] Dear listeners of the Voice of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran. As you know, ceremonies were held today, on 
the orders of the exalted leader of the Islamic Revolution, His 
Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, for the martyrs of the immaculate 
shrine of Imam Reza on the day of Ashura at Shahid Motahhari 
College. 
  Dr. Hasan Ruhani, deputy speaker of the Islamic Consultative 
Assembly, delivered an address at the gathering, which we will 
hear together. 
  [Begin Ruhani recording] In the name of God, the 
compassionate, the merciful. [passage omitted] 
  Since the beginning of the glorious victory of the Islamic 
revolution of Iran, our honorable nation has been faced with 
various incidents. Our people have witnessed numerous crimes by 
the arrogant powers and their mercenaries. But possibly no 
disaster or incident has been as tragic as the incident on the 
evening of the day of Ashura at the immaculate shrine of the 
eighth imam. That is so not because a group of our pilgrims 
were cut to pieces and bathed in blood while worshipping and 
praying, since from the beginning of the revolution until now 
our honorable and loyal nation has offered many martyrs to our 
revolution. The tragedy is important from another point of 
view, and that is the violation of the sanctity of the shrine 
and the sacredness of the shrine of the innocent eighth imam -- 
greetings and blessings be upon him -- in the evening of the day 
of Ashura at the time when the people's sentiments and emotions 
toward the leader of martyrs are at their zenith. And that 
great tragedy occurred by the side of the shrine of the eighth 
Imam and the mosque, by his head. 
  That tragedy does not merely concern the world Shiites and 
the people of Iran. That tragedy concerns all Muslims and all 
the freedom-loving people of the world. From the point of view 
of any Muslim the household of honor and purity enjoys a 
particular and special respect. 
  All Islamic sects respect the family of the Prophet and the 
family of purity and innocence. [passage omitted] In the case 
of this bombing, as far as all Muslims are concerned, the 
sanctity of the Prophet's family, the mosque, and prayer have 
been violated. Innocent Muslims were killed at prayer. [passage 
omitted] 
  Why did the enemy plan this great tragedy? Why is this 
calamity unbearable for the brave Muslim people of Iran? 
Regarding the first question, let us start the discussion from 
this point: Who has not benefitted from Islam, Shiism, genuine 
Islam, the Ashura of Aba Abdullah, the shrine of the eighth 
imam, and the school of the family of the prophet? The faces of 
which powers have been slapped? If today, Iran's Islamic 
revolution stands as a strong dam against the moves of 
arrogance, and if today the power of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran as the center of all Islamic movements which resist 
arrogance and oppression...[unfinished sentence as heard] 
[passage omitted] 
  It is clear to us why the world arrogance designed and 
implemented the explosion at the shrine of the eighth imam, and 
at the time of Ashura. The bomb attack was carried out by the 
mercenaries who consider 20 June 1981 to be important. Their 
masters, who are the real plotters, the arrogant powers -- these 
mercenary grouplets have been nurtured in their laps, and 
continue their shameful life today under their protection. The 
arrogant powers themselves know very well from where the 
principal blow against them has come; it comes from the Ashura 
front [howze-ye Ashura], the family of the Prophet's front and 
by the honorable and brave Iranian nation, which moves along the 
path of the Prophet's family. The world arrogance seeks to take 
its revenge on the Iranian nation. The world arrogance seeks to 
deal its heaviest blow against the immaculate sentiments of the 
Muslim people of this land. [passage omitted] They have 
committed crimes which do not seem rational by any logic. If a 
grouplet has the slightest hope of coming to power in a place it 
does not commit actions which result in general hatred toward 
it. But a grouplet can reach a point where its only task is to 
be the mercenary of the world arrogance and nothing else. I ask 
you: Has any grouplet acted in such way -- to go toward and 
become part of the enemy while the nation was fighting a 
defensive war; to fight, and even worse, to spy for the enemy in 
order to kill one's own people? When Iraqi pilots were captured 
during the war they would be asked in their debriefings: Why 
did you have to bomb residential centers and not the city 
outskirts? You would have carried out your mission and would not 
have killed so many people. The pilots would say: Our problem 
is the Mojahedin-e Khalq [MKO]; we would have bombed the 
outskirts, but as soon as we bombed, the MKO informed Baghdad of 
the whereabouts of the attack. If we did not attack residential 
areas our lives would be in danger. 
  Is there a comparison to this in history? Which mercenary 
has ever spied in such manner against its own people and against 
innocent women and children in cities and villages? Do you know 
of a similar case? This grouplet has reached a dead end. It 
has to accept the truth, which it will not do. It never did. 
[passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] In the Kashmir Valley, the two Britishers -- Kim 
Housego and Mr. David Mackie -- kidnapped by the militants have 
been released after 17 days of captivity. The two were released 
unconditionally today in the jungles of Pahalgam. Later, they 
were brought to Srinagar where they were handed over to the 
first secretary of the British High Commission in India. The 
two Britishers were kidnapped on the 7th of this month from 
Kharo in Pahalgam by a militant outfit, Harkatul Ansar. 
  Talking to AIR [All India Radio] correspondent in Srinagar 
after their release, Kim Housego and David Mackie said they did 
not know the exact location where they were kept. They were

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz by Kamal </F>
Tarabayh on 23 June; place not given; from "The Political Week" 
program -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Tarabayh] What is the latest 
about the Middle East peace process on the Lebanese-Israeli 
track? 
  [Buwayz] I am sure you are aware that Lebanon entered these 
negotiations on two principles. The first concerns Lebanon; 
that is, Israeli occupation of the Lebanese territory in the 
south and western al-Biqa'. Lebanon continues to believe that 
Resolution 425 constitutes the accurate, clear, and just 
mechanism to remove this occupation. This is a basic condition. 
  Secondly, Lebanon is concerned about the dispute in general. 
Lebanon is an Arab country, one of the ancient Arab 
decisionmaking states and one of the founding members of the 
Arab League. It hosts a large number of Palestinian people. It 
is concerned with any peace in the region and with the fate of 
these Palestinians. Therefore, Lebanon deals with this issue in 
general in solidarity with the other Arab states. It will not 
sign an agreement in isolation of the other concerned states and 
before these states have regained their usurped rights. So far, 
Israel wants to combine these two cases and we cannot yet say 
that Israel has agreed to the principle of leaving the occupied 
Lebanese territory. 
  We presented a clear mechanism. We said that Israel should 
abide by full withdrawal behind the internationally recognized 
borders. For this reason, we will accept the formation of a 
joint military committee to discuss the tabulation and 
programming of this withdrawal in addition to how peace and 
stability can be secured in the south. Lebanon will then begin 
talks in solidarity with its brothers on the level of this 
future peace. [passage omitted] 
  [Tarabayh] Mr. Minister, frankly speaking, you are aware 
that 
the West, especially the United States, is asking the Lebanese 
state to spread its control on the entire southern region; that 
is, stopping the resistance operations so that Israel could stop 
its attacks on the south. Are you adhering to the principled 
stand of the Lebanese government; that is, continuing the 
resistance until the end of the occupation? 
  [Buwayz] You said at the beginning that the world is 
demanding that Lebanon impose its control over its entire 
territory. That is what we wish and that is what we are 
demanding from the Western world. However, the reality is 
different. We believe that nobody in this world would like to 
die for nothing, nobody likes to die unless he believes in a 
sublime objective. We believe that the resistance is the result 
and not the cause of the occupation because it began after the 
occupation. A solution for this problem lies in reassuring 
Lebanon that Israel will withdraw from its territory to the 
internationally recognized borders. I believe that other 
solutions, be they military or security solutions, have proved 
after many years that they are futile and will only result in 
more violence in southern Lebanon. 
  I really would like to ask about the results of the Israeli 
attacks on the south over the past 10 years. Have these attacks 
with all their technology, sophistication, and power, been able 
to cancel the will of the Lebanese people to regain their south? 
I think the solution is a political one and lies in a clear 
Israeli commitment to withdraw from southern Lebanese. 
  [Tarabayh] If full Israeli withdrawal from the south is 
realized, will Hizballah undertake to hand in their weapons and 
renounce fighting? 
  [Buwayz] In any case, there is an undertaking by the 
Lebanese 
state that when Israel withdraws, this Lebanese state will be 
committed--and it now has all the resources, and the required 
security and stability--to implementing a full security plan in 
the southern region. I believe that this has been a constant 
policy of the successive governments during the era of President 
al-Hirawi. These governments have presented this undertaking to 
more than one team. Lebanon does not love violence and trouble. 
It does not seek more than its natural and legitimate rights. 
When this is realized. the Lebanese state, which is now strong 
by its armed forces, will be committed to spreading its full 
control over the entire south and laying down the basis of peace 
and stability. [passage omitted] 
  [Tarabayh] What is Lebanon's attitude on the various tracks 
of negotiations and the Arab coordination? 
  [Buwayz] We have all wished this peace to be a comprehensive 
peace. We cannot view the comprehensiveness of this solution 
and this peace the way things are being done; that is, by 
separate means. Therefore, Lebanon, which believes that this 
peace has to be either comprehensive or not to be at all, based 
on experience and prior consideration of things, cannot but call 
on everybody to effect cohesion in the peace process. 
  Moreover, we believe that this peace is an Arab-Israeli 
peace 
decision. Who represents the Arabs? They are represented by 
all their states, trends, and forces. Therefore, we believe 
that separate solutions will empty the meaning of a 
comprehensive solution for the Arab-Israeli question. So far, 
we believe that an Arab peace decision cannot be concluded 
except through a unified Arab decision. It does not come 
through separate paths. 
  As for what was realized on the Jordanian level in terms of 
achievements, so far I really do not believe that there are 
achievements. I do not know if you are aware what these 
achievements are.

  [Text] Riyadh, 20 June, SPA -- The assistant secretary 
general for political affairs at the Gulf Cooperation Council 
[GCC], ambassador 'Abd-al-Aziz Bu'ali, has stressed the 
anxiousness of their majesties and highnesses the leaders of the 
GCC countries to back any joint Arab action and to sanction Arab 
unity in any part of the Arab homeland, proceeding from their 
belief that any cooperation gives strength to the Arab nation 
and consequently the Muslim nation. 
  At a press conference held today at the GCC headquarters in 
Riyadh, he said: "When Yemen's unity was established in May 1990 
the GCC countries supported and sanctioned this unity which came 
about with mutual consent". 
  He also talked about the great efforts made by the GCC to 
stop the conflict between the brethren in Yemen and find a 
suitable ground to solve the conflict through negotiations and 
away from bloodshed, massacres and destruction. 
  He reviewed the efforts made by the servant of the two holy 
places, King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz Al Sa'ud, His Highness 
Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan, president of the United 
Arab Emirates, and their brothers the GCC leaders to contain 
this crisis. He then deplored the worsening of the conflict 
between the two sides which led to the destructive war going on 
in Yemen now. He stressed that the fundamental view of the GCC 
states now was to insist on a cease-fire. 
  In reply to a question on the nature of measures which the 
GCC states could take if the fighting continued between the two 
sides, Ambassador Bu'ali said he hoped that fighting would end 
between the two sides, otherwise other steps would have to be 
taken either by the GCC states or the Security Council. He 
added that the goal which the GCC states were pursuing was to 
stop the bloodshed and the destruction. He further said: What 
matters to us now is to stop the fighting and prevent the flames 
of war from spreading here and there, and as for the rest -- 
everything will be examined accordingly and we will deal with 
the developments in the future. 
  In reply to a question on the GCC center for commercial 
arbitration, he indicated that the center was set up to 
arbitrate disputes which might arise between a trader and 
companies or between other traders involved in similar 
commercial activities with the GCC states abroad [as received]. 
Finally, he reviewed the commercial projects which would be 
executed in the framework of cooperation among the GCC states.

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council, yesterday met with the 
brother ulema, men of religion, social figures; representatives 
of political parties and popular and youth organizations, and 
military men in al-Dali' District, who expressed to the brother 
president their happiness over their meeting with him, as he is 
a national symbol who has epitomized concern about the homeland 
and its unity, who has proved his love for the people, and who 
backs their causes and goals. They indicated that the residents 
of the al-Dali' District, who have offered convoys of martyrs 
and heroic strugglers to obtain freedom and achieve 
independence, are willing to make dear sacrifices to safeguard 
and strengthen Yemeni unity. They will also, they noted, lend 
their wholehearted support for unity and legitimacy in 
continuation of the struggles waged by the residents of the 
al-Dali' District throughout their national struggle. 
  The al-Dali' District representatives reaffirmed their 
readiness to make dear sacrifices to safeguard unity and 
confront its enemies, whoever they may be. They noted that our 
Yemeni people cannot survive without unity, which is our 
people's fate and destiny. Similarly, there can be no future for 
our Yemeni people without unity. They asserted that the 
traitorous and agent rebels only represent their treacherous 
psyches. Their objectives will never be achieved, they said. 
Our people, and their Armed Forces will repulse their schemes, 
which are hostile to the people and their unity. 
  The al-Dali' District representatives affirmed that unity 
ended the fragmentation nightmare, as well as the tyrannical 
party rule. They explained that the attempts to rehabilitate 
fragmentation, regardless of the form this might take, and of 
the person who might attempt this, is a betrayal of the people's 
aspirations and struggles, and also of the sacrifices made by 
their righteous martyrs. They added that the sons of the 26 
September revolution and the 14 October revolution, and the 
strugglers of the liberation war will be loyal to the principles 
upheld by our people and their Armed Forces, chief among which 
are the revolution and unity. They also noted the deceptive 
propaganda promoted by the rebellious secessionists and the 
erroneous misrepresentation of facts to citizens to delude the 
public. They mentioned the torture and oppression being 
perpetrated by the traitorous rebels against the innocent 
residents of Aden, who are being used as human shields, who are 
being forced to bear arms, and who are also being forcibly sent 
to death. They urged their misled brothers and sons not to 
allow themselves to be taken in by the propaganda of the 
rebellious secessionists, and to quickly rejoin the forces of 
unity and legitimacy, where they normally belong. By so doing, 
they will take advantage of the general amnesty. Moreover, they 
will also help end the bloodletting in Yemen and defeat the 
schemes that aim to end unity and destroy the homeland. 
  The Presidential Council chairman then spoke, welcoming the 
brother ulema, men of religion, social figures, and party 
leaders of al-Dali' District. He pointed out that the brotherly 
meeting came after a tragedy befell the homeland as a result of 
the conspiracies and after the agents rebelling against 
legitimacy decided to ignite sedition due to their 
conspiratorial system, which they have inherited and on which 
they have been brought up in return for a handful of desecrated 
money. These sides, he said, worked to escalate the military 
situation in Abyan, 'Imaran, Dhamar, Aden, and al-Dali' as part 
of a hellish plan to disrupt the homeland. 
  The brother president said: We talked about that plan, which 
began after the traitor and secessionist agent, al-Bid, returned 
from abroad and after he received the price of secession and the 
blood of the sons of the homeland. Traitor al-Bid, he added, 
actually began his plan through the resounding speeches he 
delivered in al-Dali' District to ignite sedition, whose price 
he had received. The brother president said: Al-Bid and his 
supporters, like the traitors al-'Attas, Bin-Husaynun, al-Sayli, 
and al-Jifri, have deposited the money they received at European 
banks. These people have received the price of the Yemeni's 
people's blood and ignited sedition in the homeland to disrupt 
it. He pointed out that these traitors tried exercising a media 
disinformation campaign to win the feelings of the masses, only 
for a short time though, because the people discovered their 
nature and that of the slogans the traitor al-Bid used to 
repeat, like the civilized project, which means to these 
traitorous agents destruction, death, secession, and stirring up 
sectarian differences in the name of Qahtani, 'Adnani, Zaidite, 
Shafi'ite, southerner, northerner, and other sectarian 
differences. 
  The brother president said the traitor al-Bid has been 
lying to the people because he is skilled at lying, he is 
psychologically ill, he suffers from an inferiority complex, and 
he is known for his conspiracies against Qahtan al-Sha'bi, 
Faysal 'Abd-al-Latif al-Sha'bi, the diplomats, 'Abd-al-Fattah 
Isma'il, 'Ali 'Antar, 'Ali Hadi Sha'i, Salih Muslih, and 'Ali 
Nasir Muhammad. If he finds no one against whom he can 
conspire, he conspires against himself. The brother president 
said: This is not a vilification, but it is the truth. Our 
Yemeni people are paying the price in blood and in destruction 
for what the terrorist rebels have spread in the homeland. 
  The brother president also said that during the crisis, he 
informed several people in the Districts of al-Dali', Radfan, 
and Yafi' that al-Bid would carry out his secessionist plan, 
that their sons would become fuel for that plan as they are 
fighters, and that al-Bid would be the first to escape. We, he 
added, also advised Haytham when he was still defense minister 
not to be drawn into the secessionist plan and to support unity, 
but, regrettably, he was drawn into that plan in return for 
money. These people did not remember the martyrs' of the 
revolution and martyr strugglers 'Ali 'Antar, Salih Muslih, 
Sha'i' Hadi, 'Abd-al-Fattah Isma'il, and others, who were 
staunch advocates of unity. 
  The brother president added: The traitorous agent 
secessionists created sedition in the homeland. We have not 
sought to see a single drop of blood shed in Yemen, neither by 
those who are supporting unity and legitimacy, nor by those 
opposed to them, who, in the final analysis, are our sons. To 
avert this, we have attempted dialogue. We have gone to Jordan 
and signed a pledge and accord document there to end the crisis 
and spare our country all problems. Nonetheless, the rebels 
were bent on causing a flare-up in the situation in 
implementation of their secessionist plan, which is eventually 
targeted against the Hadramaut Governorate. 
  The brother president went on to say: The al-Dali' residents 
have always been at the forefront of strugglers, who upheld the 
slogan of unity, because they believe that their pride and honor 
are ensured when there is unity. The blood being shed right now 
is meant to safeguard unity and legitimacy. And here our people 
have lost men and property. Would the result then be 
fragmentation? Would the result be the division of the country 
into two Yemens just to gratify the desires of a few people who 
have received a price for the crisis, infighting, and secession, 
and who will eventually flee the homeland to use their money 
after having caused fires in the homeland? 
  The brother president said: We thank the brother residents 
of the al-Dali' District. We highly appreciate their 
cooperation with the forces of unity and legitimacy. We also 
thank the fighters hailing from the al-Dali' District, who are 
currently waging an honorable battle in defense of unity, and 
who are making sacrifices to safeguard unity, as they made 
sacrifices to vindicate the revolution and achieve independence 
in the past. All, people and parties, are currently melting in 
the crucible of the homeland and forming a broad front in the 
face of the traitorous and rebellious secessionists. 
  The brother president added: Today, we reiterate the call 
for the brothers who have been misled into fighting on the side 
of falsehood to take advantage of the opportunity granted them 
by the general amnesty to rid themselves of the coma they are 
suffering due to media deception and propaganda so that they may 
rejoin the ranks of the strugglers vindicating unity and 
legitimacy, where they actually belong. They should not agree 
to become tools of destruction manipulated by the traitors, 
agents, and mercenaries, who have sold themselves to the enemies 
of unity in return for a handful of filthy money. 
  The brother president stressed that the military personnel 
and civilians who choose to rejoin the ranks of unity and 
legitimacy will obtain all their rights, on an equal footing 
with their colleagues at all departments. They will be welcomed 
and accorded due attention. This would be an honor for them. 
Additionally, this would halt the bloodletting and vindicate 
their people's will, which has always been in favor of unity, 
because it is the epitome of their pride and dignity. 
  The brother president indicated that a government committee 
has been formed to account for the losses in human lives and 
property, and to take the necessary measures to rebuild what has 
been destroyed due to this sedition caused by the rebels. He 
added: We have instructed that all people be dealt with on an 
equal footing, regardless of whether they supported the state 
and legitimacy or were misled. This is because they all are our 
sons. 
  The brother president affirmed that the traitorous rebels 
have conspired against the Yemeni Socialist Party to liquidate 
it and marginalize its role. And here, the picture is unfolding 
before your very eyes. And now you see the traitor al-Jifri, 
and the sultans, whose ouster was sought by the 26 September and 
14 October armies and strugglers of the liberation war, 
returning to implement a plan to tear the homeland apart. He 
added: This will never happen, for the Yemeni people, their 
Armed Forces, and their security troops will lie in wait for 
these traitors and mercenaries, regardless of the sacrifices 
entailed. 
  Concluding his speech, the brother president said: We 
welcome you once again, and clasp your hands as unity-oriented 
strugglers. You must do your best to explain the facts and 
repulse the traitorous secessionists. As for the future, God 
willing, it will bring prosperity to our Yemeni homeland under 
the canopy of unity and democracy.

  [Text] Gaza City, Gaza Strip, June 25 (AFP) -- Israel and 
the PLO will resume talks on Tuesday [28 June] in the occupied 
territories, PLO chief negotiator Nabil Sha'th said Saturday. 
  He said the talks had originally been planned for Monday but 
were put back "for technical reasons." 
  Negotiators would not meet in Egypt, as suggested on 
Thursday 
by Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, but the talks "will 
be in the occupied territories," he said, although the place had 
not yet been announced. 
  Sha'th said he would meet with Dani Rothschild, head of the 
Israeli military administration, instead of General Amnon Shahaq 
who led the Israeli delegation at previous autonomy talks. 
  "Shahaq is not any more the head of the Israeli delegation," 
he said, although there was no official army confirmation of the 
move. 
  He said the two delegations would first discuss the agenda 
for negotiations. 
  They would then talk about the release of prisoners, 
extending Palestinian self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West 
Bank and completing matters which remained unresolved before the 
May 4 autonomy accord was signed. 
  Certain issues such as the exact size of the self-rule 
enclave of Jericho were put to one side so the signing ceremony 
could go ahead in Cairo, launching autonomy in the West Bank 
town and the Gaza Strip.

  [Text] Gaza City, Gaza Strip, June 25 (AFP) -- Israel and 
the PLO still have 26 disputed points to hammer out in May's 
Cairo self-rule accord, PLO chief negotiator Nabil Sha'th said 
on Saturday [25 June]. 
  "There are about 26 questions that have been postponed at 
the 
Cairo agreement," Sha'th told reporters here, blaming Israel for 
delays in negotiations. 
  The disputed points in the Israeli-PLO accord mainly centre 
on the borders of the self-rule enclaves of Jericho and the Gaza 
Strip, "which Yasir 'Arafat amended on the map on the day of the 
signing," Sha'th said. 
  He said Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation 
would resume talks on the extension of self-rule in the 
Israeli-occupied West Bank on Tuesday, "probably in the occupied 
territories." 
  He accused Israel of delaying the talks since May 18. "Now 
we are late in starting to talk about the second phase by two 
months," he said. 
  "We are ready to start talks, at the head of which is the 
question of a timetable for the release of prisoners." 
  He added: "The date of the Israeli withdrawal from all West 
Bank towns and villages is not tied to the Gaza-Jericho 
(self-rule) experiment but to the agreement, to nine months from 
the signing of the agreement. 
  "We cannot wait five years to see if Gaza-Jericho is 
successful or not." 
  Certain issues such as the exact size of the self-rule 
enclave of Jericho were put to one side before the May 4 
autonomy accord so the signing ceremony could go ahead in Cairo, 
launching autonomy in the West Bank town and the Gaza Strip.

  [Text] Cairo, 22 Jun (MENA) -- Arab League Secretary 
General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has renewed his call to the 
Yemeni belligerents to abide by the UN Security Council's 
cease-fire resolution to safeguard the lives of the Yemeni 
people and to enter into a constructive dialogue to promote 
security and stability for the fraternal Yemeni people. He 
expressed the Arab League's readiness to do its utmost to 
achieve this goal. 
  In an interview with the weekly magazine AL-MUSAWWAR 
published today, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that the fighting 
between brothers in Yemen has led to divisions and exacerbated 
the crisis. He expressed the hope that the two sides in Yemen 
will resume their dialogue as soon as possible. 
  Asked whether South Yemen has submitted an application to 
the 
Arab League to become an independent member, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid 
said: Yes, it did, but no action has been taken. The 
application is held in the General Secretariat until the Arab 
League Council holds its next meeting. 
  Asked about the internationalization of the Yemeni crisis 
and 
the fact that some states prefer to refer Arab problems to the 
United Nations, the Arab League secretary general pointed out 
that North Yemen was the one that first objected to Arab League 
mediation, because, as the Yemeni officials said, this is an 
internal matter. He said that North Yemen objected not only to 
Arab League mediation but also to UN mediation. 
  Regarding the Libyan-Western crisis and whether Libya has 
accepted the Arab League's proposal to conduct the trial of the 
suspects at the International Court of Justice in The Hague 
according to Scottish law and with Scottish judges, Dr. 
'Abd-al-Majid expressed his thanks to the Libyan leadership for 
accepting this delicate and sensitive political and legal 
situation. He noted in this regard that the recent Nonaligned 
Movement foreign ministers' conference in Cairo supported this 
initiative. He said that contacts have been held with UN 
Security Council member states and the European Union in this 
regard, and the atmosphere is completely suitable for discussing 
the means to achieve a peaceful settlement to this problem. He 
added that this will prevent an escalation of the Libyan-Western 
crisis in August, sparing the area further tension. He noted 
that a number of European countries who have interests in Libya 
do not want an escalation of the crisis and are ready to listen 
to Libya's views on the issue. 
  Regarding the embargo on Iraq, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid expressed 
hopes that the embargo will be lifted and that the Iraqi people 
will enjoy freedom, security, and stability. He said that 
everything is in the hands of the Iraqi Government. It can ask 
the UN Security Council to lift the embargo after it implements 
the UN resolutions, including those concerning recognition of 
Kuwait's sovereignty, the border demarcation, compensation, and 
the prisoners. 
  Regarding Israeli operations in Lebanon, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid 
said that what Israel has done and is doing against Lebanon is 
contrary to peace. He affirmed that Lebanon has the right to 
defend its territory and to demand the withdrawal of the Israeli 
forces. 
  He added that if Israel really wants peace in the area, it 
must stop its actions and embark on serious and effective 
negotiations to avoid operations by the Lebanese resistance, 
which is defending itself and trying to end the occupation. 
This, he said, is a legitimate right that applies to Lebanon, 
Syria, and the Palestinians, just as it applied in the past to 
Egypt before the liberation of its national territory.

  [Text] Cairo, 26 Jun (MENA) -- Arab League Secretary 
General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has called on the Yemeni 
leaders to resolve the situation and stop the fighting 
immediately. He deeply regretted the violation of the 
cease-fire for the sixth time today and reiterated the need to 
implement Security Council Resolution 924 and restore the 
constructive dialogue between the two sides. 
  In statements he made today, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that the 
Yemeni crisis has in fact entered a stage of 
internationalization, with the Security Council's intervention. 
He noted that the Arab League had tried to resolve the crisis, 
but its mission was unsuccessful. 
  He ruled out the possibility of sending an Arab League 
delegation on a new mediation mission to resolve the Yemeni 
crisis. But he referred to possible Arab League participation 
as part of a UN delegation undertaking to arrange a cease-fire 
there. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid went on to say that the Arab League's 
Secretariat General is at present coordinating with the United 
Nations in the search for a solution to the crisis. He added 
that the Arab League does not aim to compete with any other 
party or to exclude anyone from the solution mechanism, but its 
main objective is to reach a cease-fire and search for a 
settlement through a constructive and objective dialogue between 
the Yemeni parties. 
  On the question of the Arab League's recognition of the 
south 
Yemeni state, he said: We in the Arab League are bound by rules 
and laws that stem from the Charter and its council's authority. 
He added: The Arab League accepted the unity of the two Yemeni 
sectors when the north and south were joined into one state that 
became the Yemeni people's legitimate representative. 
  He said that any change in this status requires referral to 
the League's Charter and its council's authority. He expressed 
his belief that the question of recognition is not the only 
issue being raised now. He added that the main issue is the 
cease-fire and the restoration of a dialogue between the Yemeni 
parties. He added that it is premature to raise the question of 
recognizing south Yemen at the Arab League level. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid went on to say that the Arab League member 
states are sovereign. If one of these countries recognizes 
south Yemen unilaterally without the Arab League's involvement, 
the League would have no authority over it. 
  He stressed that the Arab League is constantly coordinating 
with the representatives accredited to it and with the United 
Nations through the League's New York offfice, which is 
constantly sending reports on the latest Yemeni crisis 
developments in the United Nations. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said he expects the Security Council to 
hold another meeting to emphasize the cease-fire resolution. 
But he ruled out a Security Council resolution imposing 
international sanctions on any party that violates it. 
  He admitted that it is difficult for the Arab League to 
adopt 
a resolution on dispatching international observers to supervise 
the cease-fire in Yemen, not only because Sanaa is opposed to 
it, but also because there are technical, administrative, and 
logistical difficulties that impede the international observers' 
work in Yemen.

  [Text] Kuwait, 27 Jun (MENA) -- Arab League Secretary 
General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has described the situation in 
Yemen as dangerous. He said the main reason for the fighting 
between the two parts is that Yemeni unity was not established 
on a sound basis, the armed forces continued to be split into 
two, and there were two different currencies. 
  In a statement to the Kuwaiti newspaper AL-WATAN today he 
regretted the failure of the UN secretary general's envoy 
Lakhdar Brahimi's mission and appealed to leaders of the two 
sides to end the fighting and immediately start negotiations 
under the auspices of the United Nations or any other party they 
agree upon to stem the bloodshed in the country. 
  'Abd-al-Majid emphasized that the Arab League's primary goal 
is to stop the bloody fighting between the two sides. He noted 
that the issue of recognizing south Yemen is left for the 
future, that the League's documents indicate that the Yemeni 
Arab Republic is a unified state, and that any change in status 
should be decided at the League Council in light of the northern 
and southern parties' views. 
  Concluding his statement, 'Abd-al-Majid said unity can never 
be imposed by force.

  [Text] Cairo, 23 Jun (MENA) -- Arab League Secretary 
General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid today received Russian 
Ambassador Vladimir Polyakov. 
  The ambassador said later that on the instructions of the 
Russian leadership he had requested a meeting with the League's 
secretary general to exchange views on the latest developments 
in Yemen. 
  He pointed out that Russia and the League are cooperating 
and 
coordinating their stance on resolving the Yemeni crisis, noting 
that this cooperation takes a diplomatic and political form. 
  The Russian ambassador explained that when the war broke 
out, 
his country appealed to the warring parties in Yemen to stop 
fighting and initiate a dialogue to solve their problems. 
  Polyakov pointed out that Russia's recognition of south 
Yemen 
will depend on the findings included in UN envoy Lakhdar 
Brahimi's report to UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
on the crisis. He denied reports claiming that Russia is 
supplying south Yemen with weapons and assistance in view of the 
close ties linking Moscow with south Yemen in the past. 
  He said Russia halted all weapons supplies to the Yemeni 
parties when the Yemeni crisis began and before fighting broke 
out.

  [Text] Kuwait, 26 Jun (MENA) -- Responsible sources in the 
Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry have stated that the reason for 
postponing the meeting of the Damascus Declaration countries' 
foreign ministers, which was scheduled to start on Tuesday [28 
June], is these countries' desire to wait for the outcome of the 
UN Security Council decision on Yemen, in addition to the 
foreign ministers' commitments to unforeseen activities. 
  Ambassador Khalid al-Jarallah, director of the Gulf 
Cooperation Council's affairs at the Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry, 
said that consultations are now under way between the Damascus 
Declaration countries' foreign ministers to set a new date for 
the meeting, adding that there is a proposal to hold it next 
week. 
  In an exclusive statement to MENA's correspondent in Kuwait, 
he said that a number of issues will top the agenda of the 
meeting, the most important of which are the situation in Yemen 
in light of the expected Security Council resolution, Iraqi 
intransigence in implementing the UN resolutions, the Middle 
East peace process and its developments, and other issues of 
concern to the member countries.

<F P=106> [By Nadim Kawash] </F>
  [Text] Abu Dhabi, June 26 (AFP) -- The GATT deal to remove 
trade barriers will prompt Arab farmers to upgrade production to 
face competition, but it will also raise the region's already 
large food import bill, Arab officials and experts said on 
Sunday [26 June]. 
  Although they form less than five percent of the world 
population, the Arab League's 22 members account for nearly 12 
percent of total world farm imports, according to official Arab 
figures. 
  The agricultural imports averaged 23 billion dollars a year 
over the past decade, while exports did not exceed five billion 
dollars, said Ma'mun Hasan, director of the Kuwait-based Arab 
Corporation for Investment Guarantee (ACIG). 
  "When subsidies on farm output are removed, in line with the 
recent accord by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, 
world food prices will naturally rise," he told the United Arab 
Emirates daily AL-FAJR. 
  "This will have two effects. It will force Arab states to 
pay more for food while it will also encourage farmers to 
upgrade output to face competition and get higher prices for 
their products." 
  Several Arab states are now members of the Geneva-based 
GATT, 
which has turned into a new group called the World Trade 
Organisation. 
  The deal signed in Morocco two months ago called for 
removing 
trade barriers among its nearly 120 members and lifting 
subsidies on national products. 
  Experts said Saudi Arabia would suffer more than other Arab 
states from the agreement, as it spends billions of dollars on 
agricultural subsidies, mainly for wheat. 
  Other Gulf states also subsidise vegetable and fruit in a 
bid 
to achieve self-sufficiency. 
  Outside the Gulf, political instability, lack of investment 
and poor infrastructure are blamed for the deterioration of the 
agricultural sector in Arab countries. 
  "Development of the farming sector in Sudan could solve the 
Arab food problems, as it has vast arable areas," a Gulf-based 
expert said. 
  "But Sudan has no funds, its infrastructure is primitive and 
the country is threatened with disintegration because of the 
civil war. Only a crazy investor will put his funds into the 
farming sector now." 
  The situation in other fertile Arab countries is not much 
better. 
  Iraq is facing international sanctions and an uncertain 
political situation, and Algeria is hit by Moslem militant 
unrest. 
  Somalia, also a member of the Arab League, is torn by civil 
war. 
  The four countries account for more than 70 percent of the 
total arable area in the Arab world, estimated at 198 million 
hectares. 
  So far only 27 percent of the land has been exploited due to 
lack of investment. 
  The rapid growth in Arab population has combined with such 
problems to aggravate the region's food gap, the difference 
between farm imports and exports. 
  According to the Abu Dhabi-based Arab Monetary Fund [AMF], 
the cumulative Arab food import bill totalled around 210 billion 
dollars between 1980 and 1990, while exports stood at only 40 
billion dollars. 
  A breakdown showed the growth in imports covered all farm 
products except fruit and vegetables, though they are still 
imported by some members. 
  From around 18.6 million tonnes in 1980, Arab cereal imports 
surged to 34.3 million tonnes in 1992. 
  Wheat imports jumped from 12.4 million tonnes to 21.1 
million 
tonnes, the AMF said in a study. 
  Dairy products also soared, from nearly one million tonnes 
to 
9.1 million tonnes, while tea, coffee and tobacco rose from 
461,000 tonnes to 530,000 tonnes and meat from 666,000 tonnes to 
794,000 tonnes. 
  Investment in the Arab farm sector did not exceed 7.5 
percent 
of the Gross Domestic Product annually over the past decade, 
while loans extended to agriculture stood at only 3.8 billion 
dollars between 1973 and 1992.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a comprehensive review 
of all items in the 21 June issue of the Arabic-language 
newspaper Cairo 'AQIDATI that pertain to political Islamic 
issues. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. A Muslim Must Not Accuse Others of Apostasy 
  2. Ulema Committee Meets To Respond to Extremist Thoughts 
  3. Awqaf Minister Berates Officials for Ignoring 
Instructions 
  4. Ulema To Go To Russian Republic To Teach Islam 
  5. International Islamic Conference in Alexandria in 
August 
  6. Islamic Writer Urges Muslims To Seek West's Knowledge 
  7. International Islamic Conference in Cairo in July 
  8. Columnist Criticizes West's Stance on Bosnia 
<H5>  A MUSLIM MUST NOT ACCUSE OTHERS OF APOSTASY </H5>
An approximately 2,000 word unattributed report on pages 1, 8, 
and 9 of 'AQIDATI notes that the al-Azhar Fatwa Committee ulema 
have declared that Islam prohibits a Muslim from accusing 
another Muslim of apostasy without genuine and concrete 
knowledge. Even if an individual Muslim finds out that another 
Muslim is a renegade, he "must not mete out punishment," because 
this is a task that must be verified and carried out by 
officials in charge of society. Only competent officials have 
the means to ascertain that a certain individual is a renegade 
and mete out a sanction, the article states. A Muslim who 
violates this rule is culpable and is working against true 
Islamic teaching. 
<H5>  ULEMA COMMITTEE MEETS TO RESPOND TO EXTREMIST THOUGHTS </H5>
  A 120-word unattributed report on page 2 says that the ulema 
committee that has been formed to respond to the thoughts and 
claims of extremists held its first meeting on 15 June, where it 
reviewed the books from which the extremists derive their 
thoughts. Several named professors and ulema attended the 
meeting, which was chaired by Awqaf Ministry Under Secretary Dr. 
'Abd-al-Rashid Salim. Salim said that at the end of the 
meetings the ministry will compile the ideas crystallized by the 
ulema and publish them in booklets for distribution to the 
public, the report concludes. 
<H5>  AWQAF MINISTER BERATES OFFICIALS FOR IGNORING INSTRUCTIONS </H5>
  A 100-unattributed report on page 2 notes that Aqaf Minister 
Dr. Muhammad 'Ali Mahjub has addressed severe criticism to the 
Awqaf departmental chiefs throughout Egypt. He stressed that 
they do not follow up the progress of the work in their 
departments, particularly regarding preaching, nor do they 
comply with the themes of the Friday sermons approved by the 
ministry. According to the report, Mahjub described his 
instructions to the chiefs as mere ink on paper. The report 
says that these chiefs are expected to be replaced. 
<H5>  UELMA TO GO TO RUSSIAN REPUBLIC TO TEACH ISLAM </H5>
  A 70-word report on page 2 states that the Awqaf Ministry 
has 
decided to send a number of ulema to the Checheno-Ingush 
Republic to promote Islam. Awqaf Ministry Diector General 
'Ulaywa said that the goal is to increase the amount of 
religious information for Muslims, teach them Arabic, and 
project the genuine picture of Islam. 
<H5>  INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIC CONFERENCE IN ALEXANDRIA IN AUGUST </H5>
  A 100-word report by Majdi Za'tar on page 3 of 'AQIDATI says 
that the largest international Islamic gathering organized by 
the Egyptian Awqaf Ministry will meet in Alexandria in 
mid-August under al-Azhar Mosque Rector Shaykh Jad-al-Haqq. 
Awqaf Minister Dr. Mahjub said that more than 50 Islamic 
affairs ministers and representatives of 100 Arab and European 
countries will attend the conference. Za'tar concludes that the 
conference will discuss the Islamic call and cooperation with 
other religions. 
<H5>  ISLAMIC WRITER URGES MUSLIMS TO SEEK WEST'S KNOWLEDGE </H5>
  In an 800-word article on page 7, Islamic writer Dr. 
Muhammad 
'Amarah exhorts Muslims to seek knowledge and learning so that 
our nation can rise and revive the Islamic civilization. He 
argues that it is wrong to blindly imitate and be subservient to 
the West, but we should seek the West's useful and positive 
knowledge while not forgetting our roots and spiritual values. 
Thus we will not be blind "imitators or subservient to the 
West" and, at the same time, we will not "isolate or close 
ourselves" to the scientific progress of the West, 'Amarah 
concludes. 
<H5>  INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIC CONFERENCE IN CAIRO IN JULY </H5>
  A 2,000 word report by Muhammad al-Abnudi and Musa Hal on 
page 10 of 'AQIDATI's 21 June issue notes that an international 
conference for the Islamic call will be held in Cairo in 
mid-July. The report says that this is the first conference to 
be devoted to the Islamic call and ways of promoting it. Awqaf 
Minister Dr. Muhammad 'Ali Mahjub said that the conference will 
discuss ten issues. The reporters then interview several ulema 
from the al-Azhar and the Awqaf Ministry, who spell out their 
views on the issues that the conference should debate. 
<H5>  COLUMNIST CRITICIZES WEST'S STANCE ON BOSNIA </H5>
  In a 200-word article entitled "Peace in Bosnia" on page 20, 
columnist 'Adil Dayf maintains that the way the European 
countries and the United States continue to deal with the 
Bosnian crisis shows that they are trying "to impose a de facto 
solution" on the Bosnian people. This is "a gross injustice" to 
the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina, he says, particularly after 
they have lost so many of their sons along with large tracts of 
their territory as a result of aggression by the Serbs and 
Croats. Peace in Bosnia, Dayf concludes, requires the 
deterrence of the aggressors, return of the territory they 
usurped, and the lifting the ban on arms for the Muslims.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a comprehensive review 
of all items in the 21 June issue of the Arabic-language 
newspaper Cairo AL-SHA'B that pertain to political Islamic 
issues. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Lawyers Announce General Strike 
  2 Detainee Explains Prison Conditions 
  3. Sudan's al-Turabi Interviewed 
  4. Brotherhood Leader Denounces Campaign 
  5. Writer Explains Anti-Brotherhood Campaign 
<H5>  LAWYERS ANNOUNCE GENERAL STRIKE </H5>
  Qutb al-'Arabi and Khalid Yunis write on pages 1 and 7 an 
approximately 1,200-word report on the Egyptian lawyers' 
protests at what they see as the government's harassment of 
lawyers. The report notes that on 20 June the Lawyers 
Association's Council met and decided to declare a general 
strike on 28 and 29 June in protest of the continued detention 
of lawyers and the arrest of five new lawyers on 14 June. 
'Abd-al-'Aziz Muhammad, head of the Cairo Lawyers Association, 
has announced that he will continue his hunger strike until all 
detained lawyers are released and the public prosecutor 
announces the results of the investigations into the death of 
'Abd-al-Harith Madani, the lawyer who died while in police 
custody. Muhammad, who is a diabetic, said that should he die 
as a result of his hunger strike, the president of the Republic 
and the government would be liable before the law. 
<H5>  DETAINEE EXPLAINS PRISON CONDITIONS </H5>
  On page 2 under the headline "A Bloody Letter From Inside 
the 
Abu-Za'bal Prison," the paper publishes a letter received from 
engineer 'Abd-al-Rahim 'Abd-al-Salam from Samalut, al-Minya 
Governorate. In introducing the approximately 2,000-word 
letter, the paper notes that it receives dozens of letters, 
phone calls, and complaints every day from relatives of people 
detained at the Abu- Za'bal Prison in which they describe the 
tragic conditions experienced by more than 2,500 detainees 
inside the prison, which the paper describes as similar to what 
existed in the Middle Ages. 'Abd-al-Salam gives his account of 
his four-month stay at the Abu-Za'bal prison and describes in 
detail the inhuman conditions and the torture that inmates 
suffer inside the prison. 'Abd-al-Salam does not specify the 
charges for which he was locked up. A drawing published above 
the message shows a prisoner hanging upside down by a rope and 
being lashed by a policeman with a whip. Addressing the 
prisoner, the policeman says: "If you don't repent, we will 
make you repent." 
<H5>  SUDAN'S AL-TURABI INTERVIEWED </H5>
  On page 4 the paper publishes an approximately 2,500-word 
dispatch by European affairs correspondent Ayman 'Ali that 
includes an interview Sudanese National Front leader Hasan 
al-Turabi gave to Britain's Channel 4 on 5 June. In the 
interview, al-Turabi refutes the Western charges against Islam 
and the Islamic movement and explains Sudan's Islamic experiment. 

<H5>    BROTHERHOOD LEADER DENOUNCES CAMPAIGN </H5>
  In an approximately 1,500-word article on page 5, Muslim 
Brotherhood Deputy Guide Mustafa Mashhur notes that Prophet 
Muhammad's hegira, or migration, from Mecca to Medina in the 
year 622 offers some lessons to Muslims today. He explains that 
the first lesson to be learned from the Prophet's experience is 
his patience and endurance in the face of "harassment and 
torture" by infidels. This shows that the faithful must never 
give up their belief regardless of the "pressure" they may come 
under, he adds. Mashhur adds: "Every Muslim must feel that it 
is his duty to propagate this religion among humanity and that 
he must follow the model of the Prophet, may God's peace be upon 
him, and his companions in patience, perseverance, and 
endurance." He notes that "victory" will be the reward for this 
patience and endurance. Another lesson, he writes, is the 
attention that the Prophet has paid to the mosque in its 
capacity as an "Islamic institution" in which Muslims practice 
their rites and discuss their affairs. He adds: "It is 
unfortunate to see the scheming against this establishment 
nowadays." The mosques and the appointment of the mosque imams, 
he adds, have become the prerogatives of the Ministry of Awqaf 
and no activity is practiced inside the mosques, which are shut 
off immediately after prayers. Turning to the current campaign 
against the Muslim Brotherhood, Mashhur writes: "The current 
campaign against the Brotherhood is part of the campaign against 
Islam and the principles of Islam that is conducted and planned 
by active enemies and that is performed by local followers. 
They mix terrorism and extremism with Islam, the religion of 
peace and security. We even find some people who criticize the 
women's veil and reject God's orders in this respect. While the 
media organs prevent veiled broadcasters from appearing on the 
screen, they allow cheap obscenity involving women in 
advertisements and low-quality movies." He notes that the 
Muslim brothers are falsely accused of adopting violence and 
seeking to overthrow the regime, charges that are published in 
the national press which is subsidized by the people's money. 
He adds: "We tell all these people and those who collaborate 
with acts of injustice that nobody will come to your aid when 
God calls you to account for every word said or act done to 
support the oppressor." He consoles the oppressed people by 
telling them that the Prophet's life gives a vivid example of 
how the faithful, who were few in number, have triumphed over 
all their enemies. He urges them to be patient, to persevere, 
and to pray to God for victory. 
<H5>  WRITER EXPLAINS ANTI-BROTHERHOOD CAMPAIGN </H5>
  Labor Party official Naji al-Shihabi writes an approximately 
1,000-word article entitled "The Campaign Against the 
Brotherhood and a New Era" on page 11. He notes that security 
documents published in the magazine AL-MUSAWWAR accuse the 
Muslim Brotherhood of seeking to establish a political party, as 
if it is an unforgiven crime. The Brotherhood, he adds, has 
been operating since 1928 and accordingly it has a right to 
establish a party to reach power through the ballot box; that 
is, by the public will. He explains that describing the Muslim 
Brotherhood as an illegitimate group is absurd, since legitimacy 
comes from the people whom this group serves. The people, he 
adds, voted for this group when it joined the Labor Party in the 
1987 elections for the People's Assembly. Explaining the reasons 
for the government's campaign against the Brotherhood, 
al-Shihabi adds: "We believe that the recent campaign against 
the Muslim Brotherhood group is due to its rise as a political 
group possessing enough elements of strength that have enabled 
it to virtually control the Professional Associations, with all 
the human and financial resources available to these 
associations." He adds that observers and analysts believe that 
such a performance could enable the Brotherhood to reach power 
through a "peaceful popular will," something that has frightened 
the regime.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Hasan Abu-Zayid on the first </F>
session of the Palestinian National Authority held 26 June in 
Gaza] 
  [Text] The PNA [Palestinian National Authority] met at the 
Government departments complex in Gaza City today to discuss a 
number of issues, notably funding sources for the PNA and the 
status of aid from donor nations. 
  The man in charge of the planing portfolio in the PNA is Dr. 
Nabil Sha'th: 
  [Begin Sha'th recording] The PNA held its first session 
today, with the participation of all its members who are now 
present in Gaza and Jericho. It was an important session that 
laid the groundwork for the organizational structures. We 
agreed to adopt a spirit of teamwork and on the need for each 
department to have its own organization and budget. We will be 
holding weekly sessions in Jericho and Gaza alternately. We 
will next meet in Jericho next Sunday [3 July], God willing. We 
also agreed to meet again after lunch for another look at 
certain important matters, including the detainees and 
prisoners, as well as mundane, everyday issues in Gaza and 
Jericho. The PNA then met with a World Bank team to assure 
themselves that the money flows from the donor nations via the 
World Bank channels will be enough to meet the current expenses 
of all the departments and municipal projects, including one to 
clean up Gaza. The World Bank team answered all the questions 
that were put to them. They have now returned to Jerusalem. 
  I will have my first meeting with General Danny Rothschild 
next Tuesday at Eretz [crossing point from Gaza to Israel] to 
work out the mechanism and agenda and methodology [preceding 
word in English] for future negotiations and committee meetings. 
It will be a preparatory session. Before my meeting with Gen. 
Rothschild, I will confer with Minister Yosi Sarid also at 
Eretz. I will likely travel to Cairo Thursday [30 June] for a 
scheduled meeting with Belgium's foreign minister and the donor 
nations. On 4 July, the Palestinian Police Support Group is due 
to convene its first meeting. It will bring together 
representatives of all the donor nations. [end recording] 
  Reacting to the findings of the Shamgar Commission [the 
inquiry that investigated the 25 February massacre of Muslim 
worshipers in Hebron by Dr. Baruch Goldstein], Dr. Nabil Sha'th 
said: 
  [Begin Sha'th recording] The matter is now on brother 
Abu-'Ammar's [Yasir 'Arafat] desk. I think the entire PLO 
Executive Committee membership will also look at the findings. 
[end recording]

  [Text] This afternoon, Dr. Nabil Sha'th said he has sent 
the Shamgar Commission report to 'Arafat and members of the PLO 
Executive Committee in Tunis. The PLO leadership's reaction to 
the report will be issued after the report is studied. 
  Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that several members of 
the Palestinian Authority have already rejected the conclusions 
of the Shamgar Commission. Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat said the Cave of 
the Patriarchs massacre was not perpetuated by one individual 
but rather stemmed from the settlement policy. He maintains, 
therefore, that the Israeli Government should bear the 
responsibility. 'Urayqat warned that the presence of the 
settlers in the territories is a time bomb which can go off any 
minute.

  [Text] Brother President Yasir 'Arafat, president of the 
state of Palestine and chairman of the PLO Executive Committee, 
yesterday evening [25 June] received Yahya al-'Arashi, the 
Yemeni minister for civil service and administrative reform, the 
personal envoy of Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. 
  The minister briefed President 'Arafat on the current 
developments in Yemen at all levels, especially the moves being 
made by the Yemeni leadership on the political and diplomatic 
levels to halt the fighting on the basis of the maintenance of 
Yemeni unity. 
  Brother President 'Arafat stressed to the Yemeni minister 
that the Palestinian people and leadership supported the Yemeni 
people and their leadership, and that on our part we were fully 
prepared to exert every effort to halt the fighting and to 
support everything that will benefit the interests of Yemen. 
  The meeting was attended by brothers 'Abbas Zaki and Sakhr 
Habash, members of the Fatah Central Committee, and Muhammad 
Ahmad Haydar, the Yemeni ambassador in Tunis [name and title as

  [Text] Brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat], president of the 
state of Palestine and PLO Executive Committee chairman, has 
demanded the release of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails 
and deployment of international observers in the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip before 4 July in accordance with the agreement signed 
by the PLO and Israel on 4 May. 
  At a meeting last night with ambassadors of the European 
Union states in Tunis, brother President Abu-'Ammar called for 
lifting the restrictions imposed by the Israeli forces on the 
movement of Palestinian officials on the crossings that link the 
West Bank with the Jericho area and Gaza. 
  Informed Palestinian sources said brother President 
Abu-'Ammar emphasized the importance of realizing these demands 
before his return to the Palestinian self-rule areas, and the 
importance of expediting the assistance promised by the donor 
countries for reconstruction and construction in these areas. 
  He said he cannot return to Gaza and Jericho before 
receiving 
this assistance. 
  The source said the ambassadors of the European Union 
promised, at the meeting which was held at their request, to 
convey the demands of brother President Abu-'Ammar regarding 
assistance to their governments.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Severe Crisis Erupts Among </F>
Traditional Fatah Leaders"] 
  [Text] Tunis, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- While eyes are focused 
on knowing when Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat is going to 
leave Tunis for Gaza and Jericho to assume the self-rule 
authority there, well-informed Palestinian sources have told 
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that a severe crisis has erupted among the 
main Fatah leaders: Yasir 'Arafat, Mahmud 'Abbas [Abu-Mazin], 
Muhammad Ghunaym (Abu-Mahir), and Faruq Qaddumi [Abu-al-Lutf]. 
  The sources said that Abu-Mahir, head of the Mobilization 
and 
Organization Department [MOD] and member of the Central 
Committee, has decided to quit political action and that he 
intends to reside in Amman or Damascus or remain in Tunis. 
  According to the sources, the Palestinian president, who has 
close social links with Abu-Mahir, tried early in the week to 
persuade him not to resign, but his attempts failed, although 
'Arafat personally visited the MOD head's office last Sunday and 
had lunch with Abu-Mahir the day before yesterday. 
  Other information indicates that Abu-Mazin too has expressed 
to the Palestinian president his wish to quit organizational and 
political action -- which some people have interpreted as 
resignation from Fatah. 
  Meanwhile the new appointments made by 'Arafat have provoked 
angry reactions among numerous Palestinian leaders, especially 
Abu-Mahir, Abu-Mazin, and Abu-al-Lutf. Some circles say that 
they now regard themselves as merely formal leaders in the 
movement and that the ship's helm is now steered by hidden hands.

<F P=106> [Interview with Faysal al-Husayni, "Jerusalem minister in </F>
the Palestinian National Authority," by Mahmud Abu-'Id in 
Jerusalem; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Abu-'Id] What is the aim of your upcoming 
visit to Saudi Arabia? 
  [Al-Husayni] Actually it will be my third visit to Saudi 
Arabia. But it is the second with regard to the Jerusalem 
issue. The main aim is to discuss the city's position in the 
current political process, in addition to the Saudi political 
and moral role. [passage omitted] 
  [Abu-'Id] You talk about practical measures in the face of 
Israel's escalation with regard to Jerusalem. What measures do 
you believe should be taken? 
  [Al-Husayni] Israel has recently stepped up its measures 
against Jerusalem, closing and besieging it, hence forcing its 
residents to depart. It has prevented them and continues to 
prevent them from building [their homes]. This is in addition 
to the demolition of hundreds of houses and buildings on the 
pretext that these buildings were built without licenses. But 
on the other hand it has stepped up the building of Jewish 
settlements inside and around the eastern part of the city. 
  Israel's aim behind all these measures is to destroy the 
infrastructure and economic structure and prevent Jerusalem from 
communicating with West Bank cities and the Gaza Strip. 
  These practices require from us a resolute position in order 
to confront the challenges. I believe that this can only be 
done through practical organization. [passage omitted] 
  [Abu-'Id] What is your opinion of the Israeli practices 
aimed at preventing the setting up of self-rule institutions in 
Jerusalem? 
  [Al-Husayni] The Palestinian institutions present in 
Jerusalem should not be hampered. According to the message we 
have received (from Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and 
the Norwegian foreign minister), these institutions should be 
encouraged. As for the institutions set up after this message 
to play a role alongside the Palestinian National Authority 
under the recent accord, it is natural for them to be in the 
self-rule areas. In practice, there are no self-rule 
institutions in Jerusalem. 
  The media clamor aroused by Israel regarding Jerusalem 
institutions reflects some Israeli concerns that this 
Palestinian presence, which has begun to develop its mechanisms, 
is alarming them. 
  [Abu-'Id] Have Israeli authorities asked you personally to 
move to Jericho to live? 
  [Al-Husayni] Actually no one has asked me to live there. 
They said that, if I want to be a National Authority member, I 
should move my offices to Jericho. What is meant is the office, 
not the accommodation. 
  [Abu-'Id] And are you prepared to take such a step? 
  [Al-Husayni] No. From the outset I have stressed my 
agreement to join the National Authority, provided this is not 
going to keep me away from Jerusalem. And as Jerusalem requires 
a lot of time, I prefer to be responsible for issues related to 
Jerusalem. 
  [Abu-'Id] Will Jerusalem be subject to political bargaining? 
  [Al-Husayni] East Jerusalem is the capital of the 
Palestinian state.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>
  [Excerpts] Israel will allow Palestinians residing in East 
Jerusalem to be elected to the autonomy council in the elections 
to be held in the territories at the end of the interim 
arrangement, if they hold dual residency: in Jerusalem and in 
the West Bank. This proposal was raised in internal 
deliberations held recently in Jerusalem in anticipation of the 
next phase of the talks with the PLO. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, Israel has informed the PLO that it will not 
allow 
members of the temporary Palestinian Authority, operating in the 
self-rule areas in Gaza and Jericho, to serve in the same 
capacity in Jerusalem. This restriction will also apply to 
Faysal al-Husayni. [passage omitted] 
  Security sources told the cabinet yesterday that the number 
of terror incidents in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank and the 
incidence of rioting in the West continues to drop. 
  The sources noted that the number of summer visits to the 
territories is expected to increase by 70 percent over last 
year. According to them, over 10,000 visitors might arrive every 
day, and there will apparently be a great deal of pressure at 
the Allenby Bridge crossing.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Radwan Abu-'Ayyash, chairman of </F>
the Palestinian Radio and Television Corporation, in Jerusalem, 
by Fayiz al-Miliji in Cairo; date not given; from the "Dialogue 
From Afar" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Miliji] Now that the transmission of the 
Palestinian television has started in the Jericho area, we want 
to know what are the problems facing you? Also, will there be a 
similar radio broadcast? 
  [Abu-'Ayyash] There are many problems are facing the radio 
and television transmission process in Palestine. As for the 
radio, we are currently connecting the transformers and 
transmitters in Ramallah, which were owned by the Palestinians 
before 1967, with the two studios constructed in Jericho and 
Gaza Strip. We need a few days to complete the connection. We 
implore Almighty God to help us to transmit to the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip as well as some parts of the towns in the fraternal 
neighboring countries. 
  [Al-Miliji] What areas which will be covered by the 
transmission? 
  [Abu-'Ayyash] With God's help and care, the transmission 
will 
cover the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the first stage, and after 
a few months we will be able to reach some neighboring areas 
such as the Jordan Valley; the pre-1948 territories, Israel; and 
certain parts of Sinai. However, this transmission will not be 
able to reach Egypt, Syria, Jordan, or Lebanon. 
  [Al-Miliji] Does this transmission involve both radio and 
television? 
  [Abu-'Ayyash] I am indeed talking about the radio 
transmission, which will operate on a medium-wave AM frequency 
of 594 [kiloHertz]. This band will cover this area. 
  [Al-Miliji] What about the television transmission? 
  [Abu-'Ayyash] We have started experimental television 
transmissions in the Jericho area. Work is underway to connect 
it with the Gaza region. The television transmission will be 
completed in 10 days, God willing. We will be able to cover 
Gaza and Jericho after the completion of the structure of the 
television network in the West Bank towns and Gaza Strip. At a 
later stage this television transmission will be able to cover a 
wider area, including the entire West Bank and major parts of 
Israel and the Jordan Valley, the Lebanese borders in the north, 
and the 'Aqaba and Eilat in the south. 
  [Al-Miliji] Can you tell us about your cooperation with some 
foreign and some Arab countries in this field? 
  [Abu-'Ayyash] As for the Arab countries, Egypt and Jordan 
are 
the only two countries that have extended help to the 
Palestinian radio and television project, which represents a 
national plan within the infrastructure of the future 
Palestinian state. Fraternal Jordan has trained 25 male and 
female students in this field. They graduated after a six-week 
course. We will send 80 candidates to Egypt for the same 
intensive course. We hope that the Islamic Bank will release 
the necessary funds for accomodations. The Egyptian Information 
Ministry has donated 100,000 Egyptian pounds to finance the 
building of studios and the hiring of instructors needed for 
this course. 
  [Al-Miliji] How many people will be coming to Cairo? 
  [Abu-'Ayyash] It is hoped that 70 to 80 people will go to 
Cairo for training in various radio and television fields. This 
includes studio technicians, because Egypt is known for its 
experience in this field. Qatar, Tunisia, and Algeria have 
promised to extend assistance in this regard. We have not 
received any other offers. Although we applied to the Arab 
Radio Association for assistance last summer, regrettably we 
have not received a sufficient response, making it difficult to 
speed up the project. This is in addition to other problems. 
Furthermore, dear brother, Europe has not yet released the 
funds it has promised us for this project. 
  [Al-Miliji] Mr. Abu-'Ayyash, let us briefly discuss media 
issues and their relationship to political issues. Let us begin 
with the statements by Israeli leaders, led by Rabin, on 
Jerusalem, particularly Rabin's statement that President 'Arafat 
can visit the holy places as a Muslim? 
  [Abu-'Ayyash] Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin from time 
to time opens the issue of Jerusalem. He is well aware that the 
issue of Jerusalem has been put off and is a subject for 
negotiations at any time and place. He is also aware that 
Muslims have lived in Jerusalem for thousands of years, and that 
Jerusalem is not Israel's property and can never be so under any 
circumstances. Such statements complicate matters and do not 
express a genuine intention to achieve a permanent, 
comprehensive, and just solution in this area. I say--as 
Muslims, Christians, and Jews say--that peace begins and ends in 
Jerusalem. No one can have a mandate over Jerusalem other than 
those from the three religions who live there. Therefore, it is 
an issue for negotiations. As for the visit by President 
Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] to Jerusalem, he cannot visit 
Jerusalem as a Muslim but, God willing, he will come to 
Jerusalem, because it is part of the territory occupied in 1967, 
and what applies to Jericho will definitely apply to Jerusalem, 
as stipulated by UN Security Council Resolution 242, which is 
the basis of the settlement. 
  [Al-Miliji] The United States has raised the level of 
Palestinian representation in Washington to that of a foreign 
mission. How do you view this step and its significance? 
  [Abu-'Ayyash] This was really an important and significant 
step. Palestinian leadership circles have worked for such a 
decision for a long time. This is also the result of the role 
other Arab forces, particularly fraternal Egypt, have played to 
promote the process of peace based on justice. Such a step was 
natural, particularly after Israel, through the signing of the 
agreement, recognized the PLO as the sole legitimate 
representative of the Palestinian people. In my view, this U.S. 
step is important and useful and will promote the peace process 
and encourage the forces that believe in peace to achieve a just 
peaceful solution in all the area and on all tracks.

  [Text] A recent opinion poll shows that the Palestinians of 
the occupied territories have been regaining their high morale 
since the fall of 1993. 
  The poll, conducted by the Nabulus Palestinian Studies and 
Research Center on 31 May 1994, also shows that Fatah's 
popularity is growing. 
  According to the poll results, published on 14 June 1994, 
66.5 percent of the respondents are "optimistic" or "relatively 
optimistic" about the future, against 21.5 percent who are 
pessimistic and 12 percent who expressed no opinion. 
  According to an earlier poll by the same center conducted in 
February 1994, the ratio of optimists was only 39 percent, 
against 37 percent who were pessimistic about the future. 
  The new poll shows that a 57-percent majority of 
Palestinians 
approve of the autonomy agreement signed by Israel and the PLO 
in Cairo on 4 May and that Fatah's popularity is on the rise. 
Thirteen and a half percent said the agreement is "excellent," 
26 percent termed it "a good agreement," and 17.5 percent 
believe it is "fair." 
  Forty percent criticized the agreement, with 17.5 percent 
saying it is "bad" and 22.5 percent calling it "not favorable". 
Three percent had no opinion. 
  The Fatah Movement, the main PLO faction, got the support of 
44.5 percent of the respondents, who said they would back it in 
elections for a representative council. This represents a 7 
percent rise over its popularity according to an earlier poll in 
April. 
  In contrast, the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), the 
major opponent of the peace process, has lost ground and 
obtained only 12.5 percent of the votes. In the April poll it 
enjoyed the support of 16 percent of the interviewees. 
  A 2,000-member cross section of the population of the West 
Bank and the Gaza Strip took part in the poll. 
  At the same time, an Israeli opinion poll published on 13 
June 1994 showed a contrary trend among Israelis, where popular 
support for the Palestinian autonomy agreement fell from 62 
percent in September 1993 to 54 percent now. 
  The poll, conducted by the Israeli Applied Social Research 
Institute, shows that only 41 percent of Israelis favor the 
geographical extension of the autonomy, in comparison to 50 
percent in September, immediately after the signing of the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles.

<F P=106> [Interview with Egyptian President Husni Mubarak by </F>
unidentified correspondent in Surt on 26 June -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] What is the occasion of this visit? 
  [Mubarak] It is not really a visit. It is a meeting with my 
brother and in the same country. I mean when I move from Cairo 
to Surt or Tubruq I consider myself moving in the same country. 
In fact I think that the meeting with the brother Colonel is 
something that will make both peoples happy because we are 
consulting each other, exchanging views, investigating any 
problems and helping development in both countries. All these 
things are for the benefit of the peoples. Our visits are 
always valuable working visits. The meetings with the brother 
Colonel are always for exchanging political views, exchanging 
economic views or for discussing projects for the benefit of 
both countries. 
  [Correspondent] Does the presence of some ministers with you 
here in Libya have some definite significance. 
  [Mubarak] When I come to Libya do you want me to come 
without 
ministers? Everyone of them has work here because there are 
existing links. For instance, there are agreements to establish 
a railway link across Libya to Egypt. There are operational 
joint companies. There are many things and a lot of work 
between us and Libya. 
  [Correspondent] Are there any new developments in the Arab 
and international arenas which you are going to discuss today. 
  [Mubarak] Naturally we will talk about all the problems in 
the Arab arena. We will talk about Yemen, perhaps we will talk 
about Somalia. We will talk about everything that concerns the 
Arab World because it concerns us. 
  [Correspondent] What is President Mubarak's comment on the 
new developments of the so-called Lockerbie case, particularly 
the developments... 
  [Mubarak] Let us not talk about Lockerbie on TV. Let me talk 
about such things with the brother Colonel. 
  [Correspondent] But there are new developments which 
exonerate the Libyan citizens. 
  [Mubarak] I do not want to talk about this issue now. Let me 
talk about this with the brother Colonel. In the media you 
always publish something and then he comes up with a reply and 
we get into bickering. Leave us alone. With the brother 
Colonel I will discuss these issues. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you Mr. president.

  [Summary From Poor Reception] Libyan leader Colonel 
Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi and Egyptian President Husni Mubarak held

  "Bilateral ties, Arab and international issues of mutual 
interest were discussed during the talks." 
  Both men confirmed the need to "protect and develop Arab and

Arab nation." 
  Mubarak, who arrived on Sunday in the town of Sirte at the 
head of a large delegation consisting of four cabinet ministers, 
his top political adviser, and head of his office at the 
presidency, had earlier held a round of tete-a-tete talks with 
al-Qadhdhafi. Al- Qadhdhafi held a dinner in Mubarak's honor.

  [Text] Libyan revolution leader Colonel Mu'ammar 
al-Qadhdhafi hosted a banquet last night in honor of President 
Husni Mubarak and his delegation. It was attended by the Libyan 
prime minister, senior Libyan officials, secretaries of the 
General People's Congresses, Egypt's ambassador to the Libyan 
Jamahiriyah, and the Libyan ambassador in Egypt. 
  Talks between President Husni Mubarak and Libyan revolution 
leader Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi opened in the Libyan city 
of Surt last night. President Mubarak and Colonel al-Qadhdhafi 
held a bilateral session of talks followed by an expanded 
session attended by members of the delegation accompanying 
President Mubarak, the secretary of the Libyan General People's 
Committee, ministers, Egypt's ambassador to the Jamahiriyah, and 
Libya's ambassador to Egypt. 
  Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif said the meeting 
between President Mubarak and Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi 
dealt with several Arab, regional, and world issues. The 
delegates exchanged views on the Yemeni crisis, developments in 
Somalia, and the Middle East issue. The meeting also dealt with 
the general world situation and its political and economic 
impact on Arab and regional issues. 
  Al-Sharif added that the two leaders' talks covered the 
outcome of the African summit held in the Tunisian capital 
recently and the meetings and discussion held on the sidelines 
of the summit. 
  The information minister said the delegates reviewed 
bilateral relations and assessed the implementation of previous 
resolutions passed by the Egyptian-Libyan Higher Joint 
Committee. Within this context the delegates discussed 
implementing a project to build 170 km of railroad between 
Musa'id and Tobruk supervised by a joint working group from the 
Egyptian railroad and Libyan technicians using both countries' 
local resources. Also discussed was a project to lay an oil 
pipeline between Libya and Egypt and an agreement to conduct a 
joint study of the project and set up an Egyptian-Libyan company 
to execute it. 
  The information minister added that the delegates reviewed 
the electrical grid project between the two countries and 
measures taken in this regard as well as bilateral cooperation 
in various sectors, including cultural and media cooperation. 
  President Mubarak and his delegation arrived in the Libyan 
city of Surt last night. They were received by Colonel Mu'ammar 
al- Qadhdhafi and top Libyan officials.

  [Text] Sudanese Foreign Minister Husayn Sulayman Abu-Salih 
has declared that the government supports Yemeni unity, and 
calls for an end to fighting between brothers to preserve the 
gains and resources of the brotherly Yemeni people. He pointed 
out the need for dialogue to preserve Yemeni unity. In an 
interview with AL-SUDAN AL-HADITH, published today, Dr. 
Abu-Salih added that Sudan is endeavoring to achieve Arab and 
Islamic solidarity and transcend differences, while directing 
its attention against designs aimed at destroying Arab unity. 
He explained that Sudan had taken some earnest steps in this 
respect, through dialogue and adherence to initiatives directed 
at improving relations among Arab states, the Gulf Cooperation 
Council and the Arab Maghreb states. The foreign minister 
declared that a number of western states have begun to make 
contacts with Sudan to restore their previous relations. He 
pointed to the change in relations with the U.S. Government 
after the visit of Madeline Albright. He added that those 
changes came as a result of the realization by those states of 
Sudan's firm stands toward respecting the sovereignty of states, 
and noninterference in their internal affairs.

  [Text] Khartoum, 24 Jun (SUNA) -- Dr. Husayn Sulayman 
Abu-Salih, the foreign minister, has said that Sudan's foreign 
relations with African, Asian, and neighboring states are stable 
and are developing based on common interests and the 
strengthening of economic and technical cooperation. 
  In an interview published by the Jordanian newspaper AL 
DUSTUR at the end of the 30th summit of African heads of state 
which was quoted by the Sudanese AL INQADH AL-WATANI newspaper, 
Abu-Salih added that Sudan's relations with some Western states 
were better than its relations with Iran. 
  He accused Britain of conveying misleading information on 
Sudan to the United States, which portrayed the people's defense 
camps as places for training foreigners in Sudan. He said we 
still challenge any quarter to prove that a single foreigner has 
completed his training in Sudan.

  [Text] London, 25 Jun (MENA)--The Sudanese opposition 
al-Ummah Party has accused the Sudanese security authorities of 
harassing party leader al-Sadiq al-Mahdi who was arrested last 
Monday. A statement by the party said al-Mahdi and two of his 
aides, who are detained in a Khartoum prison, have suffered 
various harassment acts. Their families are not allowed to 
visit them and they have been denied clean clothes and food from 
outside the prison. 
  The statement added that the Sudanese security authorities 
have barred the lawyers who offered to defend al-Mahdi from 
contacting him and obtaining an indictment against al-Mahdi and 
his colleagues. 
  The statement appealed to human rights organizations and 
fraternal and friendly forces to continue pressuring the 
Sudanese Government to guarantee the safety of and release 
al-Mahdi and his aides immediately.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with 'Ali Reza Rahmani, "member of the </F>
Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization," by unidentified correspondent; 
date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Close-up shot of Rahmani talking to camera, 
interspersed with shots of bombed shrine at Mashhad and funeral 
procession of those killed; interviewer not shown] 
  [Rahmani] In the name of God, the Merciful, the 
Compassionate. My name is 'Ali Reza Rahmani, alias Hamid Reza'i. 
I was a member of one of the operational teams of the 
Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization [MKO]. I was sent into the 
country in order to place a bomb in Mashhad. I have been in 
prison for the last 20 months. Although I had given all the 
information I had, I was not prepared to take part in a 
television interview. However, following the recent crime 
carried out by the grouplet in the shrine of the eighth imam, I 
announced my readiness to take part in a television interview. 
I have two motives for this interview: First, to expose the 
antihuman nature of this evil grouplet; and second, to give a 
message to people like myself who have become puppets in the 
hands of this grouplet. [video of bombed shrine] 
  After I left this country I was arrested by Iraqi 
intelligence and taken to prison. After interrogation in the 
Iraqi intelligence prisons, I announced that I entered Iraq from 
Iran in order to join the organization [MKO] and I provided them 
with the specific code. After giving them the specific code and 
other codes, the intelligence officers arranged a meeting 
between me and the leadership of the organization, who were in 
touch with Iraqi intelligence. I met Mehdi Bara'i and Fereshteh 
Yeganeh. At this meeting I gave the code and specifications I 
had, and managed to gain their trust. It became clear that I 
was one of the organization's supporters inside the country. 
After I was fully recognized, Mehdi Bara'i and Fereshteh 
Yeganeh sent me to the MKO camp, called Ashraf, which is near 
Baghdad. We were housed inside U-shaped buildings inside the 
camp. We were separated from other members of the organization. 
During this time, we received training in the use of colts, 
grenades, bombs, and destruction, and in weapons' recognition. 
Those directly responsible for this training were Fereshteh 
Yeganeh, Nasrin Berenji, Mehdi Madavi, and Sa'id. 
  The single and group combat training took three months. At 
the end of the training period they put on certain ceremonies 
for us, called arming ceremonies. During these ceremonies, Pari 
Yusofi, representing the MKO leadership, read a message. The 
text of the message was: You are the best group of home 
headquarters [setad-e dakheleh] inside the country. You will be 
our vanguards inside the country. We hope that you will carry 
out your operations successfully. Yours, your brother Mas'ud. 
  At the end of the ceremonies, the next day, we were divided 
into 16 groups. Each group consisted of two people. Each group 
was prepared for operations inside the country. We were the 
third group, which was dispatched into the country. The group I 
was in comprised of myself and Mohammad Javad, and because of 
the sensitivity of the task....[pauses] I mentioned that I was 
dispatched on a mission in Mashhad. Because of the sensitivity 
and worry that the organization had concerning that mission they 
separated us from the rest, and all the programs and 
explanations that we had were carried out separately and in 
total secrecy. My immediate briefing officer was Mehdi Bara'i, 
Fereshteh Yeganeh, Nasrin Berenji, and Sa'id. Fahimeh Arvani 
had direct supervision. For seven days we were in a building 
that was separate from the rest. During those seven days we 
learned more about the methods of bomb placement, methods for 
placing bombs, methods of reconnoitering the area and finding 
out about routes and traffic. And, in general, the buildings I 
was supposed to bomb were the municipality in Mashhad, the 
Justice Department in Mashhad, and the area near the Imam's 
courtyard in the immaculate shrine. Those were demonstrated to 
me on models. The places I had to bomb were all pointed out to 
me. I was briefed by maps. 
  At that time I used to think that for the sake of the 
success 
of the organization any tasks must be carried out. Essentially 
I never thought that by placing a bomb in the municipality or 
the shrine or the Justice Department that some innocent people 
would be killed. 
  After the briefings -- which I received from Mehdi Bara'i 
and 
Sa'id -- ended, Maryam Rajavi met me directly. At that meeting 
she once again reminded me of Mas'ud's message, and wished me 
success in my missions. She told me: When you complete your 
mission and return we will put resources and complete welfare 
facilities at your disposal here. We will even send you outside 
the country -- outside Iraq -- to study if you wish. And a 
series of empty promises. 
  That night, after the end of the ceremony and the talks, we 
were briefed by 'Ali Shiraz about the route that we were to take 
into the country. 'Ali Shiraz was the head of the dispatch team 
responsible for dispatching forces into the country. On the map 
placed on the table he clearly briefed us on the route we were 
to take. Later, Mehdi Bara'i gave me three packages of cooking 
oil, which contained explosives and bombs, and said they are to 
be taken for operations at designated places. They gave me 
cyanide tablets and said I should not be arrested alive and that 
I should commit suicide if I felt in danger. They also gave me 
false identity cards to help me on the trip. We started off the 
following morning and were accompanied by 'Ali Shiraz, 'Ali 
Abolfathi, Hassan, and Sa'id. Coordination had been made with 
Iraqi posts along the way and we travelled from Baghdad to an 
area near the Qasr-Shirin border with no difficulty. We even 
changed cars at the Iraqi posts and received equipment. Finally 
we reached the Qalavand post, which is next to Naftshar on the 
Iraq border. With the cooperation of Iraqi officers there we 
used long-distance binoculars in the observation post to study 
the route we were to take. The dangerous points and Iranian 
posts were studied and noted. We were again and finally briefed 
by 'Ali Shiraz about the map. At night, Mohammad Javad, 'Ali 
Abolfathi, and Hassan and I started off on the designated route. 
  We entered our own country, with the aim of placing our 
bombs 
in the designated areas once we reached our objectives, and we 
would carry out our mission in the best possible way and please 
our masters. 
  I was arrested before I could reach Tehran. And in prison I 
learned that my team mate, Mohammad Javad, had been killed by 
his own bomb in Naser-Khosrow Street [in Tehran], while he was 
preparing it. 
  Out of eight teams dispatched to the country, 14 persons 
were 
arrested, one was killed, and one escaped. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Rahmani, the question here is, why did 
you choose Mashhad to carry out the operation? 
  [Rahmani] At the time, in 1371 [year starting 21 March 1992] 
Mashhad witnessed a lot of unrest. That was why the 
organization paid particular attention to Mashhad. As they said 
themselves, another commotion; uproar had to be created in 
Mashhad again. That was why they offered Mashhad to me. They 
offered areas to me; after 20 months in prison I now realize 
just how many innocent people would have been killed if I had 
exploded a bomb in the municipality or the Justice Department. 
[video shows crowds shown chanting: "Death to the MKO;" "Death 
to the Shameless MKO;" "Death to America." Crowd begins to 
repeat chants after a chant leader: "This is proof of America's 
crime;" "The Plot of the Shameless MKO;" "Where have these 
petals come from; they have come from the immaculate shrine of 
Imam Reza."] 
  [Correspondent] You pointed out that you were to place the 
bomb in holy Mashhad and at the holy shrine of His Eminence Imam 
Reza, peace be upon him. Why was this place chosen? 
  [Rahmani] Basically the aim of the organization in sending 
me 
to Mashhad and placing bombs in places I mentioned was because 
the places were crowded. The main aim of the organization was 
to explode the bomb in crowded places. It was emphasised to me 
to place the bomb in the municipality when the mayor was 
present, when the municipality would be the most crowded. As an 
answer to your question: The organization chose them simply 
because they were crowded. 
  [Correspondent] As you say yourself, the municipality and 
the 
holy shrine of His Eminence Imam Reza are crowded places. What 
was your motive? 
  [Rahmani] The atmosphere and the misguidance was such that I 
imagined everything was possible. Even killing and massacring 
people seemed normal to me. I was prepared to do anything to 
better present myself to my responsible officers and masters. I 
thought that the organization was all important. It was my 
father, mother and sister. There was misguided propaganda. 
They even told me that if I was arrested I would have boiling 
water poured over my body and I would be flogged. However, 
since the time of my arrest not the slightest disrespect has 
been shown toward me. I was under the influence of emotions and 
did not know what I was doing. Finally, I ask for the 
forgiveness of the martyrdom-rearing nation and the leader of 
the Islamic revolution. I can only say that I am sorry.

  [Text] Tehran, June 25 (AFP) -- Iraq was behind the bloody 
bomb attack in a holy shrine in Iran which killed at least 24 
people and wounded dozens, the semi-official TEHRAN TIMES 
charged Saturday [25 June]. 
  "It is unimaginable (to think) that the terrorists group 
could have undertaken such a heinous act without first having 
cleared it through the Iraqi intelligence authorities," the 
English-language newspaper said. 
  It was referring to the main armed rebel group, the People's 
Mojahedin, accused by Iran of Monday's [20 June] attack in the 
shrine of Imam Reza in the northeastern city of Mashhad. The 
Mojahedin have strongly denied any involvement. 
  The daily accused Baghdad of "commissioning" the Iraq-based 
Mojahedin to "plant the bomb in the holiest site in Iran." The 
Mojahedin "could have obtained such a bomb only from the Iraqi 
security forces," it said, referring to the 4.5 kilogram (10 
pound) device. 
  The Interior Ministry said 24 were killed and 70 injured, 
while the official IRNA news agency said 26 had died and 170 
others wounded. 
  Iran on Thursday [23 June] indefinitely postponed a visit to 
Iraq by a Foreign Ministry delegation in protest at Baghdad's 
support for the Mojahedin. The visit was to continue 
discussions on normalising ties five years after the end of the 
1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war. Talks resumed last October after they 
were broken in the wake of the Gulf war. 
  Tehran has also accused Baghdad of encouraging the Mojahedin 
to carry out sabotage activities inside Iran and the Iraqi 
intelligence service of being directly involved in bomb attacks 
here. 
  Iranian Intelligence Minister 'Ali Fallahian said earlier 
this month that two high-ranking Iraqi officers were arrested 
for smuggling explosives to Iran and planning bomb attacks.

  [Text] An element of the terrorist monafeqin [hypocrites -- 
pejorative reference to Mojahedin-e Khalq] involved in the 
bombing of the holy shrine of the [Imam] Reza, may peace be upon 
him, has been identified, announced the Ministry of 
Intelligence. The spokesman for the ministry distributed the 
picture of the individual and called on the Iranian public to 
help arrest him, IRNA reported. 
  The individual, Mahdi Nahvi, was identified after another 
monafeqin element was arrested while trying to place a bomb at 
the Makki Sunni mosque in Zahedan last Thursday [23 June]. 
  The spokesman called on the Iranian people to inform the 
ministry's information headquarters -- telephone number 113 for 
provincial centers and 233031 in Tehran -- should they come into 
contact with him or have any form of information on him.

  [Text] Tehran, June 27, IRNA -- The terrorist Mojahedin-e 
Khalq Organization (MKO) claimed responsibility for a bomb blast 
at a military center in northern Iran on June 15, reported the 
Iraq-based MKO radio station Monday [27 June]. Officials have 
not so far confirmed the claim but an informed source said that 
the MKO has made the claim in order to project the country as 
insecure. 
  The MKO also followed the same objective in the Mashhad bomb 
blast, he said. 
Twenty-six pilgrims were martyred and 170 others injured when a 
bomb went off at the holy shrine of Imam Reza (as) [peace be 
upon him] on June 20. He said that by spreading rumors about 
attacks on military centres, the terrorist MKO try to pretend 
that their terrorist attacks are focussed on military centres 
and not social meetings. 
  The claim is made at a time when security forces have 
collected documents and evidences on the involvement of the MKO 
in the bomb blast at the holy shrine of Imam Reza (as). The 
Information Ministry has published a facial sketch of Mahdi 
Nahvi, a member of the terrorist MKO who was involved in Mashhad 
bomb blast and called on the nation to introduce him to security 
forces.

  [Text] Beirut/Amman--Is it possible for the mullahs to play 
the role of the shah in some Gulf states and the Arabian 
peninsula, or will such an influential role, if it occurs, lead 
to nothing other than unrest in the region? Arab political 
circles in some Arab countries began to discuss these questions 
after they received secret diplomatic reports from Tehran that a 
new plan was under way to rebuild Shiite organizations in Iraq, 
Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain and to increase financial and 
political support for extremist Islamic organizations in 
Palestine and Lebanon. 
  The information AL-MUHARRIR has received indicates that 
Tehran has allocated large amounts of money to cover the 
activities of its satellite organizations. 
  Figures in this regard show that millions of dollars have 
been allocated to rebuild and breathe a new life into Shiite 
organizations in the Arabian Gulf region. 
  The main organizations and the amounts of money they will 
receive are as follows: 

  -  The Islamic Front for the Liberation of Iraq, which will 
receive $100,000 per month. 
  -  The Iraqi al-Da'wah Party, which will receive $150,000 per 
month. 
  -  The Popular Front for the Liberation of the Arabian 
Peninsula, 
an anti-Saudi organization, which will receive $150,000 per 
month. 
  -  The Islamic Movement for the Liberation of Bahrain, which 
will 
receive $70,000 per month. 


    It is worth mentioning that these four organizations have 
offices in Tehran. Diplomatic reports say that by supporting 
these organizations, Iran is seeking to stir up unrest in Gulf 
countries to restore Iranian influence, which prevailed during 
Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's reign and which diminished 
gradually after the mullahs controlled the government and after 
the end of the Iraq-Iran war. 
  Reports also say that pro-Iranian organizations carried out 
bombing operations in Kuwait years before the entry of the Iraqi 
forces in it. They add that Iran was responsible for some 
bombing operations and shootouts that occurred in Kuwait after 
the return of al-Sabah family to power. 
  The same diplomatic reports say that the Iranian leadership 
has drawn up a new plan to support the Islamic Jihad Movement in 
Palestine, led by Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, and to provide necessary 
amounts of money to the movement to enable it to build bases in 
the occupied territories. 
  Ahmad Jibril, secretary general of the Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine-General Command, presented al-Shaqaqi to 
the Iranian officials. Since then, the latter has been 
receiving $100,000 per month to cover the costs of his 
organization in Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan, in addition to other 
amounts of money being paid to the occupied territories' branch 
through special channels.

<F P=106> [Commentary prepared by the News Research and Commentaries </F>
Group] 
  [Text] The unprecedented drop in the value of the U.S. 
dollar against the Japanese yen has been coupled with great 
concern in the West's monetary circles, so much so that the 
Japanese foreign minister called on the United States to end the 
joint trade talks by reaching a rapid conclusion and to thus 
mitigate the monetary crisis in the West. 
  Meanwhile, the frightful drop in the value of the dollar 
against the Japanese yen compelled U.S. President Bill Clinton 
to call on the Treasury Department to take immediate steps to 
strengthen the dollar. It should be noted that on Thursday [23 
June] the U.S. dollar sold at less than 100 Japanese yen, which 
is the lowest exchange rate since World War II. The value of 
the dollar against the German mark also dropped to less than 
1.60 German marks to the dollar. 
  International economic experts believe that until 1985, when 
the (Plaza) Accord was implemented to reduce America's trade 
deficit with Japan and Germany and the drop in the value of the 
dollar against European currencies and the Japanese yen were 
taken into consideration, the U.S. dollar was equal to 260 
Japanese yen. This exchange rate has now dropped by more than 
60 percent. 
  The policy of dropping the value of the dollar, which was 
initially started in order to reduce America's trade deficit 
with Japan and Germany, gave rise to hopes that Japan's imports 
would increase while its exports would drop. However, although 
this had negative impacts on Japan, it was unable to correct the 
Tokyo-Washington trade deficit, which is expected to reach $70 
billion this year. 
  Yesterday the central banks of Europe, Japan, and the United 
States intervened in the foreign exchange markets in order to 
strengthen the U.S. dollar; by purchasing dollars, they tried to 
prevent a further drop in its current value. However, Western 
monetary experts are worried that the drop in the exchange rate 
of the U.S. dollar to less than 100 Japanese yen will further 
accelerate the drop in the value of the U.S. currency. Also, 
Wall Street monetary sources believe that although increased 
bank interest rates in the United States may strengthen the 
dollar, it will result in a drop in the price of shares and bond 
rates and that the experience of past economic crises in the 
United States may be repeated. 
  The question now is what impact the drop in the dollar 
against European currencies and the yen will have on the 
countries exporting raw materials, especially oil. Since oil is 
mostly paid for in dollars, and the oil-exporting countries 
import more from Europe and Japan than from the United States, 
the drop in the value of the dollar against the yen and the 
German mark will actually have a negative impact on the regional 
countries' petrodollar purchasing powers. That is why reducing 
oil incomes' dependence on the dollar and diversifying the 
foreign currencies earned from oil exports is being carefully 
considered by the economic experts of the OPEC member countries.

  [Text] Tehran, June 25 (AFP) -- A Russian special 
presidential envoy discussed the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict with 
Iranian officials here Saturday [25 June], Russian sources said. 
  Vladimir Kazimirov, who heads Russia's efforts to mediate 
between Azerbaijan and Armenia, met Morteza Bank, an Iranian 
foreign ministry expert on the Caucasus region, and was 
"satisfied" with Iran's response to a peace plan proposed by 
Russia last month, the sources said. 
  Armenia has accepted the plan to end the six-year conflict, 
but Azerbaijan has rejected it. 
  Iran, which made several unsuccessful attempts to broker an 
end to the conflict in the past, said it would work with Russia 
to restore peace in Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  Nearly 20,000 people have died in fighting since the 
Christian Armenian majority in the enclave declared secession 
from Moslem Azerbaijan in 1988. 
  Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev is due to visit Iran on 
Wednesday [29 June]. 
  Tehran and Moscow were likely to continue talks on the 
conflict in Moscow, the Russian sources said.

  [Text] Bushehr, June 16, IRNA -- Preparations have been 
made to complete Iran's nuclear power plant in Bushehr in 
cooperation with Russian experts, deputy chief of the plant Mr. 
Khabir has said. 
  He said that Russian experts were finishing their technical 
studies on the power plant and it was predicted to become 
operational by the end of the second five-year development plan. 
  Russian experts will also set up a gas power station 
adjacent 
to the nuclear power plant in Bushehr, he said, but did not 
mention the capacity of the proposed plant or when the project 
would begin. 
  Khabir said that once operational, the nuclear power plant 
of 
Bushehr would provide the country with one seventh of its needed 
electricity. 
  Construction work on Bushehr's nuclear power plant started 
in 
1974 under a German mark 7.8 billion contract with two German 
companies. By the end of 1978, 80 percent of the first reactor 
and 60 percent of the second reactor of the plant were built. 
  During the 1980-88 Iraqi imposed war, Iraqi planes bombed 
the 
power plant 10 times, killing 12 staff members of the plant and 
inflicting heavy losses on it.

  [Text] According to an agreement by Iran, Afghanistan, and 
the United Nations, 840,000 Afghan refugees will be repatriated 
to their homeland by the end of this year. 
  Mr. Hoseyni, general manager for foreign nationals in the 
Interior Ministry, said in an interview with our correspondent 
that there is no deadline for the repatriation. Mr. Hoseyni 
said: 
  [Begin recording] [Hoseyni] At the moment 1,800,000 Afghan 
refugees live in our country. Of those, 540,000 have been given 
a temporary six-month residential permit. They are refugees who 
have lived in Iran without any identification documents. The 
six-month permit has been given to them to enable them to leave 
the country. 
  In fact, 22 June is the expiration date of the six-month 
period. This group of Afghan refugees will be leaving the 
country gradually under the supervision of the United Nation and 
a representative of the Islamic government of Afghanistan. This 
has resulted from the agreement reached in the Iran, 
Afghanistan, and the United Nations tripartite commission. 
  The second group are those refugees who have been living 
legally in our country for many years. In cooperation with the 
United Nations, we have planned to repatriate 300,000 of this 
group this year. The repatriation is totally voluntary, and the 
refugee can either go back home or stay. We have made plans for 
300,000 in the current year. Therefore, if the two plans are 
carried out in full, we can repatriate 840,000 Afghan refugees 
by the end of the current year. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Is there a deadline for the 
Afghan refugees, especially the first group? 
  [Hoseyni] No deadline exists because the repatriation of 
540,000 refugees after 22 June may be carried out over several 
months. Therefore the Islamic Republic of Iran has not set any 
deadlines for the repatriation of Afghan refugees. [end 
recording]

  [Text] The sensitivity of Iran's position and the 
miscellaneous plots that are planned against the internal and 
foreign security of our country demand a serious approach and 
the need to take greater security measures. 
  The revelation of Britain's espionage plot against our 
embassy in London once again highlighted this point for our 
officials, that we should take security measures seriously. 
  The sensitivity of the situation and stances of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran necessitates a closer look at our security 
measures abroad. 
  A newspaper published in Turkey claims that the building of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran's Embassy in Moscow is being 
constructed by a Turkish company. According to a report in the 
newspaper VAKET published in Istanbul, the Iranian Embassy is 
being constructed by the Alarco company, the proprietors of 
which are Turkish Jewish investors. 
  According to a report in the Alarco news bulletin, the 
building of the Iranian Embassy complex will be handed over to 
the Iranian officials on 1 September. 
  If the claims of the Islamist newspaper VAKET are true, the 
relevant officials should view this matter in a more serious and 
precise manner. We wish to draw the attention of our relevant 
issues to this point, that the British Embassy was renovated in 
Iran a while ago, but even the cement, gravel, and all other 
materials for the purpose were transported from London to Tehran 
in sealed containers. However, our embassy in London was 
renovated by British contractors and listening and espionage 
devices were planted in it. 
  If the report of the Turkish newspaper is true, it will have 
unpleasant repercussions especially since the Turkish Jews have 
undertaken this task!

  [Text] Rival groups in Afghanistan resumed fierce battles 
in Kabul this morning. Our correspondent Darestani reports from 
Kabul: 
  [Darestani] Forces of the two conflicting sides in 
Afghanistan started severe battles in the southern areas of 
Kabul city this morning. In the battles, which are continuing, 
the two sides fired rockets and mortars at each other's 
positions, and fighter jets of President Borhanoddin Rabbani's 
government bombed the joint positions of Prime Minister 
Golboddin Hekmatyar and General Dostam in the south and 
southeast Kabul several times. 
  Severe street clashes have taken place along several lines 
of 
contact of the conflicting forces in the southern part of Kabul 
city and the forces loyal to the president are especially trying 
to infiltrate the positions of the other side. 
  Although hospital sources in Kabul have not published the 
causality figures of this battle, prolonged honking by cars 
carrying the wounded to the hospitals speak of the high number 
of casualties. 
  The severe clashes in Kabul are taking place at a time when, 
according to the decisions reached by the leaders of jehadi 
parties in Jalalabad and Islamabad, only four days are left 
before the expiration of Borhanoddin Rabbani's presidential 
term. His opponents--namely Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar, 
National Salvation Front leader Sebghatollah Mojaddedi, who was 
also the first president of the mojahedin government, as well as 
representatives of General Dostam--have gathered in Jalalabad to 
discuss the formation and institution of a government based 
outside Kabul. 
  This is the Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran, 
Kabul.

  [Text] The warring forces in Afghanistan continued 
attacking one another's positions with mortar and long-range 
weaponry today, leaving 37 people killed or injured. Let me 
draw your attention to our correspondent's report: 
  The rival groups in Afghanistan engaged in fighting in Kabul 
and its environs today, bringing one another's positions under 
rocket and heavy weaponry fire. In the course of the fighting 
the forces allied to Borhanoddin Rabbani, the Afghan president, 
subjected the positions of Hekmatyar's forces and the bases of 
the forces of General Dostam to severe shelling. The forces 
opposed to Rabbani, for their part, subjected parts of the 
northwest of the capital of Afghanistan to rocket attacks. 
  According to a spokesman affiliated to the Afghan president, 
seven people were killed and more than 30 injured as a result of 
the opposition's rocket attacks and shelling. Government 
sources also reported air attacks by forces affiliated to the 
Afghan president on the positions held by General Dostam's 
forces on the Bala Hesar hill and its environs, and they claimed 
that they had captured some fortifications in that area; the 
opposition has rejected this claim. 
  Meanwhile, reports from Herat, in western Afghanistan, state 
that aircraft under the command of General Dostam subjected the 
region to heavy bombardment. General Mohammad Zahir Azimi, 
spokesman for southwestern Afghanistan, said that during this 
attack, residential parts of Herat were attacked, leaving 10 
people dead and about 110 injured. 
  These clashes are occuring at a time when Rabbani's term as 
president is due to end in two days' time.

militia suffered a heavy defeat [sentence as heard]. 
  Bala Hesar fort was the Golboddin-Dostam militia's very 
strong position. From the heights of this fort, militia fired 
several times into the residential areas of Kabul, foreign 
embassies, and installations of public utility. As a result of 
the complete conquest of the Bala Hesar fort, militia have 
suffered heavy losses. Corpses of the Dostam-Golboddin militia 
litter the fort's surroundings. The forces of mojahedin and the 
Islamic army were able to inflict losses on the militia as a 
result of heavy weapons fire. In the course of the attack much 
damage was inflicted on the militia. The precise number will be 
announced later. According to a report by Bakhtar Information 
Agency correspondents, mojahedin of the Harakat-e Eslami 
organisation have captured large areas, including Darolaman 
Palace, Doghabad, Pilawari, and a section of Khairabad hills, in 
the west of Kabul, from the Golboddin militia. And in the 
direction of Bala Hesar's southwest, the Islamic army forces 
captured the strategic hill of Kasa Burj and many fortified 
positions of the Golboddin-Dostam militia in Maiwand Wat and in 
Shor Bazar. The received reports say that in the course of 
those heavy battles dozens of the militia were either killed or 
captured. The captured people include two prominent militia 
generals who joined the mojahedin. [passage omitted] 
  The air force of the Islamic state crushed the militia's 
positions and destroyed much of their heavy weapons. [Words 
indistinct] as a result 11 residents of Kabul City were martyred 
and (?178) others were injured. Rockets damaged the Turkish 
Embassy and the former telecommunications building. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] KABUL, June 26 (AFP) -- Forces loyal to Afghan 
President Borhanoddin Rabbani on Sunday [26 June] stormed and 
took over the final Kabul strongholds held by Prime Minister 
Golboddin Hekmatyar's militia. 
  Hekmatyar's military presence in Kabul was crushed around 
8:00am (0330 GMT) when pro-Rabbani troops stormed Maranjan Hill, 
opposite the ancient fortress of Bala Hesar, an AFP 
correspondent said. 
  The fortress in eastern Kabul was captured from Hekmatyar's 
Hezb-e Eslami faction on Saturday afternoon. The pro-Rabbani 
troops are led by Commander Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, a former Afghan 
defence minister who already controls much of central Kabul. 
  Bala Hesar and Maranjan hills were the two main strongholds 
in the capital of Hekmatyar and his military ally General Abdol 
Rashid Dostam. Most of the shells that have rained down on 
Kabul over the past six months have been fired from there. 
  Sources said Hezb-e Eslami and their Uzbek allies under 
General Dostam were pushed out of the Old Microrayan housing 
complex below Maranjan an hour later, under pressure from 
advancing infantry backed by tanks and armoured personnel 
carriers. 
  One group of Pro-Rabbani troops on Maranjan told AFP they 
had 
captured around 60 Uzbek prisoners. 
  Mortar shells crashed into Maranjan as pro-Rabbani tanks and 
men poured up the hill. "Let everyone understand the Islamic 
State of Afghanistan is not weak," jubilant fighters yelled. 
  Tanks and guerrillas fired down onto the far eastern 
outreaches of Kabul where they could see fleeing Uzbeks and 
Hezb-e Eslami fighters. 
  General Baba Jan told AFP the president's forces would march 
on neighbouring Bagrami next as part of an attempt to take 
Hekmatyar's headquarters at Charasiab, 25 kilometres (15 miles) 
further east.

  [Text] KABUL, June 26 (AFP) -- Afghan President 
Borhanoddin Rabbani's forces inflicted a massive military defeat 
on Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar Sunday [26 June], 
overrunning his strategic strongholds in eastern Kabul and 
taking 700 prisoners, a battle commander said. 
  In the fiercest Kabul fighting for several months, the 
pro-Rabbani troops also captured 20 tanks and large quantities 
of munitions, senior military commander Gadoh (eds: one name) 
said, adding "We are now waiting orders for our next move." 
  In a devastating military blow to the coalition rival force 
of Hekmatyar and ex-communist Uzbek General Abdol Rashid Dostam, 
pro-Rabbani troops seized the strategic bases of Bala Hesar and 
Maranjan Hill in two days of fighting ending Sunday morning. 
  The pro-Rabbani forces -- a mixed ethnic bag of Tajiks, 
Pushtuns and Uzbeks from many different units -- are now 
consolidating on the new eastern Kabul frontlines. 
  The Karte Naw district below Maranjan Hill is still occupied 
by Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami faction, but they face pro-Rabbani 
troops in the next-door Shah Shahid district which extends to 
the main gate of Bala Hesar, where the corpses of two Dostam 
soldiers still lay in the road. 
  The frontline on the main road running due east of Bala 
Hesar 
is about 2 to 3 kilometres distant, according to pro-Rabbani 
soldiers stationed in Dostam's former fortress. 
  "This fighting has shown the might of the state and we are 
fully confident that we can capture any position we want," said 
commander Gul Haider. 
  The main target for Rabbani's troops is now Hekmatyar's 
Charasiab headquarters, some 25 kilometres (15 miles) southeast 
of Bala Hesar. 
  To get there they have to first capture a strategic hill 
called Bini Hissar, from which sporadic small-arms fire 
harrasses the occupants of Bala Hesar. 
  Otherwise Kabul was very calm Sunday afternoon, the only 
activity being several large trucks visiting Maranjan Hill to 
collect the large stocks of ammunition left behind in 
underground bunkers by retreating Dostam troops, mujahedeen said. 
  The Hekmatyar-Dostam coalition force, which has been 
fighting 
Rabbani non-stop since it launched a failed coup attempt against 
the president in January, now faces a severe test of endurance. 
  With the loss of Bala Hesar and Maranjan, Hekmatyar, who has 
been demanding Rabbani's resignation by the end of June, may now 
have lost the clout to back his call. 
  Hekmatyar's military presence in Kabul ceased around 8.00 
a.m. (0330 GMT) when pro-Rabbani troops stormed Maranjan Hill, 
an AFP correspondent said. 
  An hour later under pressure from the advancing infantry 
backed up by tanks and armoured personnel carriers (APCs) Hezb-e 
Eslami and their Uzbek allies were pushed out of the old 
Microrayan housing complex below Maranjan. 
  An AFP correspondent crossed the Kabul River and joined the 
second wave of advancing pro-Rabbani troops racing under mortar 
fire up Maranjan Hill, the entrance to which was covered by an 
archway supporting a colour portrait of Dostam. 
  The group that claimed to be the first on Maranjan told AFP 
it had captured around 60 Uzbek prisoners. One APC was seen with 
its turret blown off and one Russain T-62 battle tank was 
captured intact. 
  Incoming mortar shells crashed into Maranjan as more 
pro-Rabbani tanks and men poured over the hill, although pockets 
of resistance were observed in Old Microrayan for a short time. 
  Inside the blue-domed mausoleum of former Afghan king Nadir 
Shah on Maranjan Hill, tanks and guerrillas fired down onto the 
far eastern outreaches of Kabul, where they could see fleeing 
Uzbeks and Hezb-e Eslami fighters. 
  More than a hint of hashish was in the air, which enhanced a 
comical drama as great lumps of ceiling fell on the machine 
gunners inside every time the tanks fired.

  [Text] Islamabad, June 26, IRNA -- Afghan Vice-President 
Molawi Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi has called for mediation of 
foreign peace missions to end the current infighting in 
Afghanistan. 
  According to a press release, the leader of Afghanistan's 
Harakat-e Enqelab-e Eslami [Islamic Revolution Movement of 
Afghanistan], also warned that if the current situation 
prevailed, the country would never see peace and tranquility 
again and would eventually fall into the hands of colonialism. 
  He accused foreign powers of involvement in the Afghan 
crisis 
and of pushing the country towards destruction in order to 
achieve their own goals. 
  The Afghan vice president urged leaders of all Afghan 
mujahideen groups to sit at the negotiating table and resolve 
their dispute through peaceful means.

  [Text] Peshawar June 25 -- In a sudden move, the head of 
his own faction of Hezb-e Eslami Afghanistan Maulvi Mohammad 
Yunes Khales has announced his candidature for the presidentship 
of Afghanistan. This has been done at a time when Borhanoddin 
Rabbani had categorically refused to quit the presidency while 
his chief adversary Golboddin Hekmatyar, was desperately engaged 
in evolving some strategy to pull down the sitting President. 
  The timing for the announcement were coincided with the 
efforts to hold a meeting of the Afghan leadership in Jalalabad 
to reach a consensus on the interim set-up in Kabul to replace 
President Rabbani and prepare the ground for a permanent 
settlement. The proposed meeting had already run into 
difficulties as only three leaders including former president 
Sibghatollah Mojaddedi, Prime Minister Hekmatyar and Karim 
Khalidi of the Hezb e Wahdat (Shiite) had so far reached the 
venue while Yunes Khales had refused to associate himself with 
any of their plans. 
  Similarly, Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi, Rasool Sayyaf and Syed 
Ahmad Gillani, too had neither showed up in Jalalabad nor were 
traceable. Sources in Nangarhar capital said the leaders already 
present there were hectically [word as published] trying to 
contact the missing leadership in order to give the Jalalabad 
summit a representative look. However, the sources added it was 
not an easy task to persuade the absentees to join in unless 
some of their preconditions had been included in the agenda. 
The sources without elaborating, added that the conditions 
virtually amounted to securing certain guarantees. Besides, the 
missing leaders have not been so enthusiastic about the summit 
in Jalalabad as they believed that in view of the rigid stand 
taken by President Rabbani and his allies, it could hardly serve 
any purpose. These view were also shared by some other major 
groups including leading commanders. 
  Meanwhile, Maulvi Yunes Khales, while announcing his 
candidature, claimed in a statement that he had been persuaded 
by the commanders, Ulema and the elders to run for the 
Presidency. He said "I consider it my duty as a Mujahid and 
religious scholar to accept this responsibility." He regretted 
that no stable and Islamic government had been established so 
far in the free Afghanistan. On the contrary he believed the 
anti-Islamic forces had become more powerful. In this 
connection, all the attempts initiated to set things right and 
restore reconciliation and peace, had failed and even the 
leadership council had failed to resolve the crisis. He said 
now that the Afghan government was about to come to an end, he 
was duty bound to come to the rescue of the country. He also 
announced a five-point charter for running the affairs of the 
country. 
  In a related development, the seminar of Afghan Leaders, 
Ulema, scholars and commanders initiated by Herat Governor, 
Ismail Khan, which was earlier postponed is now being held 
Sunday (June 26). The response to the seminar, too has been 
much below expectations with the Coordination Council having 
already decided to abstain. In all probability, the seminar, 
convened to discuss the Afghan situation in detail and suggest 
measures to end the deadlock, would hardly affect the overall 
scenario obtaining in the country for the last more than a year.

  [Text] Parliament has been dissolved. The proclamation 
dissolving parliament at midnight yesterday was gazetted by 
President D.B. Wijetunga. Nomination for elections to the next 
parliament have been set for the period from July 4 to 11. 
Elections will be held on August 16. The new parliament is 
scheduled to meet on August 25. 
  Addressing the nation today, President D.B. Wijetunga said 
the decision to dissolve parliament and to hold general 
elections was made by me after careful consideration. He said 
he was convinced that morality was an essential requisite for 
politics, as much as for every other aspect of public life. I 
also hold, the president said, that a genuine democratic 
political system of the highest quality is equally essential. 
He rejected both covert and espousal of immoral and antisocial 
and violent means to acquire power or remain in power. It is 
this conviction that encouraged him to unhesitatingly go before 
the people. 
  President Wijetunga said that his sole determination was to 
provide leadership through exemplary political conduct so that 
the secretive and corrupt forces that are today interested in 
capturing power could be defeated and proper behavior and 
discipline could be inculcated throughout our social fabric. 
You will agree with me, the president said, that the policies 
pursued by my government are the most suited for this purpose 
and the best guarantee to achieve the success we desire. 
  He recalled that in his address to the nation when he 
assumed 
office in May last year, he stated that he could not act as a 
politician but as a statesman in charge of his duties having the 
best interest of the people at heart. He said he took over the 
presidency at a crucial time and was able to bring about a 
considerable degree of political and social stability before the 
country. 
  In keeping with the economic and political philosophy of the 
government, we freed the stranglehold of respective policies and 
embarked on totalling the new economic program. President 
Wijetunga explained in detail the policies implemented and the 
achievements. He referred to the Janasaviya [welfare program] as 
a major thrust in poverty alleviation. He also recalled the 
invitation extended to the LTTE [Liberation Tigers of Tamil 
Eelam] to cease hostilities and discuss a negotiated political 
settlement and join in the political framework of the country. 
However, he said that these measures did not bring about 
concrete results. The government succeeded to a great extent in 
ridding the Eastern Province of militancy. The fact that 
elections to local authorities in this province were able to be 
conducted successfully shows ample proof of this.

  [Excerpts] Cairo, 25 Jun (MENA)--The procedural session of 
the National Dialogue General Congress opened at the 
Consultative Council this evening under the chairmanship of the 
Congress' general moderator, Dr. Mustafa Khalil, and in the 
presence of the General Congress members. 
  At the beginning of the session member Ahmad Taha raised the 
issue of the absence of the New Wafd and the Nasirite Arab 
Democratic parties. He asked the Congress to reissue calls to 
party members to participate in the Congress and to other 
nationalist forces to work for the complete success of the 
Congress. 
  Dr. Nabih al-'Alqami answered Taha saying: We have an agenda 
devised by the Preparatory Committee including various views. 
He asked the Congress' general moderator to approve the agenda 
in order to begin the Congress' works. [passage omitted] 
  Lutfi al-Khuli spoke again about existing political parties, 
so that (?we) can confront everyone with their responsibility, 
whether or not we agree with a certain party. He added that we 
must learn about each party's ideology, which should be put 
forth for discussion. He was referring to the Muslim 
Brotherhood, the communists, and those who have no legitimate 
representation. He explained the importance of inviting all 
trends to the Congress so that they can interact with us to 
build the future Egypt and stand up against all current trends 
of violence. 
  Dr. Mustafa Khalil said he welcomes all political parties, 
noting his consent to opening the door for the return of the 
Wafd and Nasirite parties to participate in the conference. 
  On the representation of the communists and Muslim Brothers, 
he said the Congress had taken the representation of various 
intellectual trends into consideration. He noted that the 
Muslim Brothers have not yet formed a political party and that 
its members represent all the existing political trends and 
legitimate parties. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 25 Jun (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak has 
once again urged the Yemeni president to stop the fighting and 
pull back troops to allow dialogue to take its course. 
  President Mubarak said: On our part, we are fully prepared 
to mediate to bring viewpoints closer to each other. 
  He warned that the end will be bad, saying: I have warned 
that if fighting breaks out in Yemen, it will continue for years 
and the potentials and resources of the state will be consumed. 
The resources of the country will be squandered on procuring 
weapons for war and destruction, instead of being devoted to 
providing the basic minimum for a decent life for the Yemeni 
people. 
  This speech came in a meeting President Husni Mubarak held 
at 
noon today with university youths attending the annual Hulwan 
summer camp. Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif said that 
President Mubarak was keen on starting a dialogue with his sons, 
the university youths. He was also eager to inform the youths 
of the various dimensions and aspects of issues of national 
interest to Egypt, be they internal or external matters. 
  Mubarak was asked about the crisis in Yemen, which is 
ongoing 
despite the advice given to the Yemeni brothers to stop the 
bloodshed and fighting and to learn about the dimensions of the 
crisis, particularly since Yemen seems to be following in the 
footsteps of Iraq. Mubarak answered: During the Gulf crisis, I 
advised Iraqi President Saddam Husayn through scores of letters. 
I did so separate from any personal feelings and with great 
honesty so that we can avert any results from dangerous 
problems, as well as avoid inter-Arab differences. 
  President Mubarak added: In the Yemeni crisis, I have 
repeatedly advised from the outset to stop the fighting. But 
there was no commitment. He noted that there is a difference 
between what happened in the Gulf and what is happening in the 
Yemeni crisis. 
  President Mubarak affirmed that Egypt is not opposed to 
Yemen's unity. But, as a general principle, we do not believe 
that unity can be imposed through military force, because it 
then becomes occupation. We also believe that unity has to be 
established through agreement and consent and has to be 
requested by the people. The president clarified that if this 
process of unity is not accurately worked out, it will backfire 
and the effects will be extremely negative. 
  The information minister said in his statement that 
President 
Mubarak explained the various viewpoints of the brothers in 
Yemen, both in the north and the south. He clarified the 
differences that caused the crisis. President Mubarak also 
explained that he cautioned against the crisis before it even 
started through meetings with the Yemeni leaders and during 
Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's visit to Egypt. He 
affirmed to the Yemeni leaders the importance of containing the 
situation and not turning to weapons. But the crisis worsened 
and the fighting continued. He said it is an accursed war; 
blood is being shed and the infrastructure is collapsing. 
  President Mubarak renewed his call to the Yemeni president 
on 
the need to stop the fighting and pull back forces in order to 
let dialogue take its course. President Mubarak said: I have 
begged the Yemeni parties to stop the fighting--and I hope they 
listen to me because I have no objective but to establish 
stability in Yemen, which is a fraternal Arab Islamic country. 
I tell all the parties: Enough of the collapse that has taken 
place. 
  He added that the Yemeni people are in the custody of their 
leaders and the leaders have to look after this charge. We will 
continue, together with all our brethren, to exert every effort 
for the sake of the Yemeni people and their stability. 
  Answering a question on his views on the national dialogue, 
its effects, and the extent of its continuation, President 
Mubarak said: The objective of the national dialogue is for all 
sections of the society and the legal forces to participate in 
it. The dialogue should not be restricted to the political 
parties alone. 
  He added: Therefore, the National Dialogue Preparatory 
Committee, as well as the General Congress, consists of 
representatives from over 20 institutions including 
associations, unions, and universities; intellectuals, artists, 
literates, journalists, and experts in various fields are also 
taking part. They represent the cream of society participating 
in this Congress, particularly since the world around us is 
changing and challenges are imposing themselves on various 
local, regional, and international levels. 
  President Mubarak pointed out that there are radical 
economic 
changes taking place. He said: This prompted me to call for a 
dialogue so that all the Egyptians can participate in discussing 
their issues, setting priorities regarding national action, and 
polishing their ideas on how to develop the Egyptian march 
economically, politically, socially, and culturally. 
  President Mubarak said that the participants in this 
dialogue will discuss various issues since they are specialists 
and experts and the parties most concerned with this issue. 
They will propose ways to address our problems, because we have 
major issues to address, such as unemployment, increasing 
production and exports, dealing with international economic 
agreements, creating jobs for workers, and enhancing overall and 
continuous development. He stated that all these issues 
comprise Egypt's economic and social stability, which is the 
basis for achieving political progress. 
  President Mubarak said: I wanted to make sure the dialogue 
would not be confined to political parties alone, but open to 
all the society's institutions. He noted that the 
recommendations would receive proper attention and all new ideas 
would be welcomed as long as they were in line with the people's 
interests. He underlined that the dialogue would not be 
confined to a certain issue but would address all issues that 
concern the public. He stated that he has given the Dialogue 
Preparatory Committee complete freedom to define priorities. He 
said that despite our efforts, certain parties are not going to 
participate in the dialogue. They declined to take part and 
wanted to put preconditions or impose priorities. 
  Regarding calls from certain parties for setting priorities 
for discussion during the National Dialogue General Congress, 
President Mubarak said: Since the president of the republic, 
who called for the dialogue, did not set any priorities or 
impose views regarding certain priorities, I expected everyone 
to let the discussions come up with priorities for the agenda of 
the dialogue. He stressed that we would hold on to any benefit 
gained through the national dialogue, because all our efforts 
are aimed at serving the interests of Egypt and its 
people--whether through the national dialogue or in all work 
sectors. He stated that the committees that will stem from the 
National Dialogue General Congress are expected to complete 
their work within two weeks and that the National Dialogue 
General Congress will complete the discussions of the 
recommendations after these committees end their work. 
  Responding to a question on the security situation and the 
extent the security forces control the real roots of terrorism, 
President Mubarak said that all the people have denounced the 
acts of terror that occurred in Egypt; that Egyptians did not 
expect any Egyptian to emerge from among them to kill his 
brothers. He said: Our people cherish their noble feelings, 
values, and adherence to principles. He said that an 
intellectual dialogue began with these extremists in 1982. He 
expressed his regret that these extremists thought the dialogue 
was a sign of weakness by the state and raised their arms in the 
face of the people. He said: I maintained my patience for a 
long time but I shoulder a responsibility toward the people; I 
have to safeguard their lives, property, security, and 
stability. He added: When my patience ran out because all 
peaceful overtures since 1982 were to no avail--I have always 
respected the law--I decided that the defendants should be 
referred to investigations and the judiciary. 
  President Mubarak said that those who violate Egypt's 
security exploit the lengthy legal procedures and commit more 
acts of violence. They threaten the lives of people, destroy 
the national economy, and affect the livelihood and job 
opportunities in the field of tourism and investment, and 
distort Egypt's image. He said: For this reason it was 
inevitable that a firm stand must be taken to confront them, and 
to refer the defendants to the military judiciary so that the 
trials may be more expeditious within the framework of fully 
respecting the law and constitution. He stated that the 
military judiciary is part of the Egyptian judiciary according 
to the constitution and it fully complies with the law. Trial 
before the military judiciary does not mean denying any rights 
of citizens. 
  Mubarak expressed astonishment at the reports that some 
people in a certain country are discussing conditions in Egypt 
and debating its stability. He said: I say to those people 
that Egypt is stable and secure with a civilization going back 
5,000 years. 
  He remarked that the world's first administration and 
government were established in Egypt on the banks of the Nile 
and that the country is stable now and will remain stable 
forever. 
  He announced: The sons of Egypt who at first fell victim to 
terrorism have begun to wake up and return to the right path. 
  He declared that the haters' attempts to undermine Egypt's 
role will fail. 
  President Mubarak asserted that he is shouldering the 
responsibility entrusted to him by the nation and that when 
certain matters reach a certain point and threaten to harm the 
people, then one cannot remain silent about them. 
  In response to questions about publications spreading rumors 
or encouraging terrorism, the president advised the young 
people: Do not listen to rumors. You must learn to distinguish 
between true and false reports. We have nothing to hide because 
truth always prevails. Rumors and lies eventually collapse. 
  Concerning Egyptian-Sudanese relations and the recent series 
of measures adopted by the Sudanese regime, including the 
closure of [Egyptian] universities and most recently the seizure 
of Egyptian-owned irrigation installations in Sudan, President 
Mubarak explained that the relationship with Sudan has a special 
delicate status and for this reason, he avoids going into the 
details of any disputes with it. 
  He noted Egyptian support for the Sudanese regime since it 
came to power despite the subsequent attempts to undermine 
Egypt's stability--a reference to the Hala'ib dispute. He said 
that the two countries' ties are historical and more than three 
million Sudanese citizens live in Egypt as the Egyptians' 
honored brothers. 
  Recalling what he said during his meeting with the Sudanese 
leader, he declared that Egypt has not fired a single bullet at 
a Sudanese citizen and that the reports about Egyptian military 
concentrations on the border with Sudan are not true. 
  He asked: Why should we mass troops when we know we will not 
fight our brothers? 
  President Mubarak explained that the Egyptian forces 
stationed in the Hala'ib area do not exceed 2,000 officers and 
soldiers and that they do not have heavy weapons as the Sudanese 
regime used to believe. He said that Egyptian and Sudanese 
officers and troops on the border between the two countries are 
friendly with each other and understand each other. 
  Commenting on the Sudanese regime's recent claim that Egypt 
incited Sudanese al-Ummah Party leader al-Sadiq al-Mahdi, 
President Mubarak said Egypt is governed by principle and will 
not conspire against the existing Sudanese regime or any other 
regime. He pointed out that Egypt will not incite any Sudanese 
national against his own country and it has no connection with 
any claims about al- Ummah leader al-Sadiq al-Mahdi. 
  President Mubarak affirmed: We do not fight Sudan. We wish 
to safeguard the Sudanese people. We will not fire a bullet 
against any Sudanese person. We welcome the Sudanese among us 
and on our territory. We wish to help Sudan but at the same 
time we cannot let anyone impose his view on us in matters 
connected with our sovereignty and stability. 
  Regarding the Middle East peace process, the information 
minister reported that President Mubarak said that [former] 
President al-Sadat had a lot of foresight and had it not been 
for his peace initiative, this region would not have witnessed 
the current major peace developments. 
  President Mubarak said that the Palestinian issue is the 
core 
of the Middle East conflict and pointed out that after Egypt 
regained its lost territory, it continued and is continuing now 
to do its utmost for the sake of peace and the restoration of 
Arab territories and legitimate Arab rights. 
  The president noted that the Palestinian-Israeli Agreement 
was the first and most difficult step. He said it gave the 
Palestinians the opportunity to return to their own land for the 
first time. 
  He stressed that Egypt assists the Palestinians but does not 
dictate any options to them. He remarked that Egypt utilizes 
its international relations for the good of the Palestinian 
cause and other Arab causes to enable the concerned parties to 
reach a just and comprehensive solution that will preserve their 
legitimate rights. 
  He declared that Egypt, as the largest Arab country, is 
seeking a real, not illusory, peace and that peace strategy must 
have its own credible components. 
  President Mubarak said the progress on the Palestinian- 
Israeli track is still difficult and that the forthcoming phases 
are the most difficult because they will deal with the 
settlements and with Jerusalem. He added that the Jerusalem 
question is viewed in a Christian and Islamic framework and that 
it is not only an Arab or an Islamic issue but has several 
dimensions. 
  Al-Sharif said that President Mubarak also discussed the 
developments on the Syrian-Israeli and Jordanian-Israeli tracks. 
  Replying to a question on the talk about establishing a 
Middle Eastern market, the president explained that the issue is 
still in the stage of proposals, interpretations, and analysis 
and that we should put things in context without oneupmanship. 
He noted that there are centers for research, analysis, and 
discussion all of which are good signs but that the issue is 
still in the form of mere proposals and interpretations. 
  Al-Sharif said that President Mubarak answered a question on 
the Social Development Fund and its role. The president said 
that the Fund has played its role according to the resources 
available and that any obstacles to its performance, such as the 
interest rate and so forth are being removed. 
  Replying to another question on developments in Rwanda, 
President Mubarak said it is an African issue and some proposals 
were discussed at the recent African summit but (?implementing) 
these proposals would require a huge expense. He added that 
France has begun to play a role to help achieve peace and that 
Egypt is helping with observers in the United Nations. 
President Mubarak affirmed that Egypt does not help one party 
at the expense of another and is not biased to any side and 
said: We have suspended an arms accord that was signed before 
the conflict broke out between the two sides. 
  The president commented on the UN secretary general's role 
in 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis and in handling various issues. 
He said we should not burden the secretary general beyond his 
capabilities and jurisdictions for he does not issue resolutions 
but implements the Security Council and UN resolutions and he 
has no funds or troops at his disposal. 
  Answering a question on economic reform, President Mubarak 
explained the inevitable situation that required the initiation 
of the economic reform process and said that a complete collapse 
would have occurred had there been no economic reform. He added 
that had economic reform not been initiated, Egypt would have 
been in a hard situation in which the provision of bread or 
minimal level of services would have been difficult. 
  He noted that the economy had neared a collapse because of 
problems that accumulated over successive years and that the 
international community had stopped dealing with Egypt because 
its economy could not meet any commitments or repay debts. He 
added: We needed loans to procure basic commodities to secure 
living provisions and we also had to establish an infrastructure 
to attract investment. 
  Replying to another question on wage increases, President 
Mubarak pointed out that economic issues are interlinked and 
that revenues are linked with expenditure and wages. He added 
that any wage increase is linked with a genuine increased 
production and that printing (?bank notes) means more inflation 
and more price hikes. Therefore, he said, economic performance 
must be controlled to maintain an acceptable and reasonable 
balance between wages and prices. 
  He added: We must bear in mind that Egypt's population has 
increased by approximately 15 million people during the period 
of the economic reform plan and that salaries and pensions also 
increased by various rates over the past five years. 
  He noted that despite all the burdens on the citizen, 
economic reform made a great progress and that no matter how 
hard the burden is, it is still better than the collapse that we 
would have encountered. 
  Asked about the amount of Egypt's debts, President Mubarak 
pointed out that these debts had reached 45 billion dollars as 
borrowing had been necessary to rebuild the infrastructure. He 
added that 50 percent of the debts, an amount equivalent to what 
has been spent on the infrastructure, has been forgiven. He 
added: Now that the debts have come within the normal and 
reasonable limits, we are in a better position and Egypt can 
fulfill its debt obligations. He noted that the availability of 
reserves at the Egyptian banks does not mean that this money 
belongs to the government. These reserves, he adds, belong to 
the people and are held as deposits with the banks. They 
provide the Egyptian economy with the necessary liquidity to 
fulfill its obligations in meeting the basic requirements, he 
added. He noted that the whole world is facing a wave of 
similar problems, such as debts, unemployment, rise in commodity 
prices, and the lack of balance between wages and prices. He 
added: We must never forget that in the sixties Egypt's 
population was 16 million and now we are close to 60 million. 
This means extra burdens to the economy and to the development 
and service sectors, he noted, adding that we always need the 
money to be able to carry out development plans and provide a 
reasonable minimum standard of living. 
  Minister al-Sharif pointed out that President Mubarak had 
begun his meeting with the university students with a speech in 
which he stressed that they represent the hope of the future, 
adding that the work of the present generation is for the sake 
of the coming generations. Mubarak was asked about the future 
of development in Upper Egypt following the establishment of the 
Southern Valley University, which represents a qualitative 
cultural leap for Upper Egypt. Mubarak emphasized that the 
development plan makes no difference between Upper and Lower 
Egypt. We must encourage the wealthy and the investors from 
Upper Egypt to establish small or large industrial or 
agricultural projects there, he added. He noted that if the 
experiment proves to be successful and if investments increase, 
we hope there will be no need to obtain an approval from the 
Investment Authority to establish any project, regardless of its 
magnitude. He noted that small investors have been encouraged 
to establish projects in the governorates where they live, 
adding that attention is given to Upper Egyptian governorates to 
raise the standards of living there and create jobs in 
productive projects. This is because the government no longer 
can hire new employees now that the salaries of the civil 
servants cost the treasury approximately 16 billion Egyptian 
pounds per year and the government's resources are limited, he 
added. 
  Before meeting with the university students, Mubarak met 
with 
university presidents and students to listen to a number of 
suggestions on developing university education and research 
centers and on the university's role in serving the society. 
Education Minister Dr. Husayn Kamil Baha'-al-Din spoke during 
the meeting and noted that President Mubarak, who opened the 
National Dialogue Congress today, wanted to meet with the 
university youth to involve them in this dialogue. He noted 
that the university students are proud of President Mubarak's 
efforts to develop Egypt and its universities. During the 
two-hour meeting, the students cheered and applauded President 
Mubarak several times during his speech. 
  Dr. Baha'-al-Din pointed out that the group of students who 
met with President Mubarak today comprised approximately 650 
students from various Egyptian universities. He added that each 
group stays at the camp for one week during which the students 
play sports, receive cultural and religious orientation courses, 
and meet with a number of officials. He noted that similar 
camps free of charge exist for university students in 
Alexandria, the Suez Canal area, Asyut, and al-Minya.

  President Mubarak and Col. al-Qadhdhafi will review the 
developments of the Middle East peace process and current

  [Text] Cairo, 25 Jun (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa 
today stated that Egypt is holding contacts with UN Secretary 
General Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali and OAU Secretary General Dr. 
Salim Ahmed Salim on the situation in Rwanda. 
  He said that he met today with the French ambassador in 
Cairo, because France came up with the initiative of sending 
troops and observers on a humanitarian mission to Rwanda. 
  Regarding the meetings of the Damascus Declaration 
countries' 
foreign ministers in Kuwait on Tuesday, 28 June, 'Amr Musa said 
that all the countries in the Damascus Declaration support a 
cease-fire in Yemen. Egypt will declare its stand on the matter 
from this perspective. 
  He added that some working papers will be presented to 
bolster cooperation among the countries of the Declaration. He 
affirmed that the Damascus Declaration is in better condition 
now than it was before. All the member countries now want to 
activate and revitalize this Declaration; to increase 
coordination and bolster cooperation among the countries, 
especially since this grouping consists of eight countries that 
are members of the Arab League. These countries meet within the 
framework of the Arab League's charter and the charter of Arab 
economic cooperation. 
  He clarified that it is important and necessary for such a 
grouping to discuss all the problems in the region and the Arab 
world and to attempt to find a common approach on how to deal 
with these problems. 
  'Amr Musa said: We agree with the need to stop the fighting 
in Yemen and to start a dialogue. 
  On the possibility of further measures being taken by the 
Security Council with regard to the Yemen problem, Musa said 
that the issue depends on the secretary general's report, which 
he will submit to the Council. The secretary general's report 
will be based on the report he receives from his special envoy 
Lakhdar Brahimi in light of the discussions he recently held in 
Cairo. 
  The foreign minister affirmed that the continued fighting in 
Yemen, despite the Security Council's calls to stop it, 
constitutes a problem. This is what makes the intervention of 
the Security Council probable. 
  On the possibility of convening a mini-Arab summit to 
discuss 
the situation in Yemen, the foreign minister said this has not 
been proposed so far. 
  Answering a question on protecting the lives of Egyptians in 
Yemen, 'Amr Musa said that protecting Egyptians in Yemen and 
elsewhere is one of the major duties the Foreign Ministry is 
shouldering. 
  He added that the Foreign Ministry works in coordination 
with 
the cabinet to secure the return of Egyptians from Yemen because 
the issue pertains to the whole country. 
  Answering a question on whether Egypt had received a 
Palestinian or Israeli proposal to host the Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations in Cairo, 'Amr Musa said that Egypt had not yet 
received such a request. He said it is ready to host the 
negotiations should the two sides ask it to do so.

  [Excerpt] Cairo, 24 Jun (MENA)--The Interior Ministry's 
official spokesman has stressed that there are no conditions for 
releasing repentant terrorists because there are no conditions 
attached to the security safeguards. Detainees are released 
after changing their deviated ideas, and after being closely 
observed. 
  In statements made today following the release of 22 
repentant extremists, the spokesman said that meetings and 
debates are being held with them in the presence of al-Azhar 
scholars and then they are secretly monitored after their 
release. He added that the Interior Ministry solves the 
extremists' financial or moral problems with the other executive 
groups through the Interior Ministry's "post-release care" 
program. 
  He stressed that the intellectual combating of terrorism is 
a 
unique and new experience that many societies before us have 
followed and it is constantly being developed in light of the 
new security changes. 
  The official spokesman went on to say that whenever a number 
of prisoners repent, they are then released; but stressed that 
this does not mean that the Interior Ministry has huge numbers 
of prisoners to whom the emergency laws are applied, adding that 
the majority of those in prisons are held for crimes they 
committed. 
  He said that the remaining extremists who declare their 
repentance will be released during the next four months. He 
added: We regard the extremist as a sick person and we try to 
treat him by arresting him therefore discontinuing his 
activities and restraining him. The law will be applied to 
anyone who commits a crime or abets it. 
  Regarding repentant Hasan al-Hillawi who played a major role 
in making the terrorist groups' members repent, the spokesman 
said that the ministry is studying the possibility of reducing 
his seven-year prison sentence. 
  Reviewing the Interior Ministry's security strategy of 
dealing with terrorism and extremism, the spokesman said that 
there is a short-term plan that involves upgrading the Interior 
Ministry's facilities and equipment, by training policemen, and 
modernizing transport and communications. He noted that there 
is a medium-term strategy that the Interior Ministry is 
currently implementing and is based on involving all executive 
and popular organs in confronting the causes of extremism. He 
added that among the organs that have already started their 
action are the Education Ministry, the Youth Organization, and 
the Awqaf Ministry. He noted that there is a long-term strategy 
that involves developing all the facilities that serve the 
people, such as the police stations and centers, the passport 
and civil records departments, and the traffic department.

  [Text] Cairo, June 25 (AFP) -- Thirty-three lawyers have 
gone on a hunger strike in solidarity with one of their senior 
colleagues, who is demanding publication of a report into the 
death of a lawyer in police custody, one of the strikers said 
Saturday [25 June]. 
  'Abd-al-'Aziz Muhammad, head of the Bar Association, began 
his hunger strike to demand publication of the document a week 
ago. He has been in hospital since Monday [20 June] after his 
condition deteriorated. 
  Hunger striker Halah 'Abd-al-'Aziz told AFP: "Eighteen 
lawyers, including three women, have been on hunger strike since 
Wednesday [22 June] or Thursday [23 June], in the Bar 
Association headquarters in Cairo, and 15 others joined the 
movement Friday [24 June] at Ismailiya and Port Said," on the 
Suez Canal. She said the lawyers, from diverse political 
groups, will continue their hunger strike "until death, or until 
the satisfaction of the demands" put by Muhammad. 
  Muhammad has called on the government to release an official 
report into the death in April of 'Abd-al-Harith Madani, an 
Islamic lawyer. Madani died in police custody. Authorities say 
an asthma attack was to blame, but the Bar Association charged 
that he died under torture. 
  Muhammad is also demanding the release of 24 lawyers 
arrested 
in May during a rally to protest Madani's death. 
  Egyptian newspapers have reported that the Bar Association 
head had recently discovered the contents of an official report 
into Madani's death, which noted "injury marks on Madani's body." 
  "That casts doubt on the causes of death of the lawyer, 
which 
could have a criminal origin," 'Aziz said. 
  The 40,000-member Bar Association, controlled by the Muslim 
Brotherhood, has come under fire recently from the Egyptian 
authorities.

  [Unattributed report: "A Correction and an Apology"] 
  [Text] AL-WAFD published the day before yesterday, Sunday 
[19 
June], a report on the arrests of the first secretary from the 
Russian Embassy in Cairo, the director of the Russian Language 
Institute, an Egyptian woman, and her son who were photographing 
some bridges in Banha. It was confirmed that the report on the 
arrest of the two Russian officials and their Egyptian 
companions was not true. 
  What happened was that the two Russian officials were the 
guests of the Egyptian family. The first secretary took some 
photographs of nature scenes on the Nile River banks. A 
citizen, who did not know their identity, remonstrated him and 
took him to the security officer guarding the Banha Bridge 
because he thought that the two Russians were violating the law. 
When the officer ascertained their identity, he apologized 
profusely for the error. The Russian diplomat gave the film to 
the officer who promised to return it after checking that it did 
not contain any photographs that violate security. 
  AL-WAFD apologizes to Yuriy Kuder Vicev, first secretary in 
the Federal Russian embassy; Dr. Evgeny Zelenev, director of the 
Russian Language Institute in the Russian Cultural Center; Mrs. 
Widad Ahmad Wahdan; and her son Ayman. AL-WAFD stresses that 
the publication of the report was not meant to be an affront to 
the Russian diplomats or to bilateral relations.

  ["Above the Red Line" column by Fawzi Ibrahim: "The Central 
Bank and a Balanced Behavior of the Exchange Rate"] 
  [Text] In their daily transactions, money brokers and 
traders 
have resorted to a serious course of action that greatly harms 
the national economy since the monetary authorities have fixed 
the exchange rate of foreign currencies, particularly the 
exchange rate of the U.S. dollar. The dollar's exchange rate 
was set at 445 dinars against the dollar at licensed currency 
shops and companies and at 425 dinars at government and private 
banks. Thus, all transactions are carried out on the basis of 
this rate of exchange. But, what actually takes place has 
nothing to do with this exchange rate as the money brokers and 
traders continue to devise ways and methods to harm the national 
economy. The money brokers are adopting rates of exchange that 
exceed the fixed rates by 10 to 25 percent. This shows how 
harmful this is to national economy. The monetary authorities 
will be unable to readjust the declared rates of exchange with 
the actual rate the money dealers adopt. To be able to carry 
out such a readjustment, the monetary authorities are called 
upon to either float or rectify the rate of exchange. Such a 
step will enable the rate of exchange to be controlled. This 
will also ensure that many of those who were dealing with money 
brokers in the licensed or unlicensed currency shops and 
companies will now deal with the government and private banks. 
It is impossible to have different rates of exchange. The best 
rate of exchange is always offered by the private sector banks. 
This will make many of those who deal with currency or those 
who transfer their foreign currency savings go to private 
currency shops instead of the banks as the difference will be 
great and may reach 50 dinar for every dollar. Such a decision 
will further stabilize the money market and will benefit the 
national economy instead of benefiting the many clandestine and 
unlicensed currency shops and companies whose number exceeds by 
far that of licensed ones. At the same time, such a decision 
will make it possible to account for the transactions in the 
money markets for budget and taxation purposes, it will check 
any sharp drop of the rate of exchange in the parallel markets, 
and it will establish a sound behavior pattern for the rate of 
exchange that will be in line with the economic circumstances. 
Restrictions and too many regulations sometimes have a negative 
impact on the national economy. This is what actually takes 
place in the money market, in addition to the factors from 
outside. Many hostile parties outside Iraq resort to means and 
methods to influence the money brokers and traders. This 
actually took place. Some Kurdish agents resorted to tempting 
means to influence the exchange rate. Unfortunately, some of the 
money brokers and speculators fell under the spell of these 
gangs, which are hostile to the homeland and the people and 
which seek to harm the economy. They have renounced their 
patriotism and ethics and have become hirelings who implement 
enemy schemes to harm the national economy and exhaust its 
resources to have the Iraqi people suffer from the embargo and 
dampen their morale. The executive authorities cannot remain a 
bystander and apply a laissez-faire doctrine. No one accepts 
such a doctrine.

  [Text] Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri received a 
south Yemeni delegation at his residence in al-Barbur this 
afternoon. The delegation is led by Yemeni Socialist Party 
Assistant Secretary General Salim Salih Muhammad. 
  They discussed developments in Yemen. Salim Salih Muhammad 
said his meeting with the Chamber of Deputies speaker 
complemented earlier meetings the delegation had with the 
president and the prime minister. 
  He added: We briefed him on the latest developments in Yemen 
and the ongoing fighting. We asked for Lebanese assistance to 
enable us to resume dialogue. We had a useful discussion and 
reached the conclusion that Lebanon's 16-year war experience 
proved that none of the parties involved could abolish the other 
parties and so dialogue proved indispensable. In Yemen we must 
learn a lesson from this experience, regardless of the ferocity 
of the fighting and one party's attempt to prevail over the 
other with guns and tanks. Nevertheless, this party will not be 
able to cancel the other party's political and natural rights. 
We need to draw lessons from the experience of other Arab 
countries that suffered civil wars. We must immediately accept 
a cease-fire, implement the relevant UN Security Council 
resolution, and start negotiations. 
  Asked if on this visit to Lebanon he was carrying specific 
proposals or requests, he answered: We have made some 
proposals. Lebanon is an Arab League and United Nations member 
and has its own political and cultural role. Fraternal Lebanon 
can provide effective help in the difficult circumstances that 
Yemen is facing. Lebanon can join its Arab brothers who are 
following up the events in Yemen to help us emerge out of our 
difficulties.

  [Text] Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri has affirmed that 
liberating our country from the Israeli occupation continues to 
be our firm objective. It is also one of the first objectives 
of the Arab movements. He said: We cling to liberation, which 
also means that we cling to the ancient principles of our nation 
and the goals for which we have struggled. Prime Minister 
al-Hariri noted that the recent government action regarding the 
nationality law constitutes a pillar for national accord, 
justice, and the restoral of the government to its citizens. He 
affirmed that the crucial stage we are in requires us to rise to 
the level of national duty. 
  Prime Minister al-Hariri made these statements during a 
dinner party held this evening at the Summerland Hotel at the 
beginning of celebrations for the fiftieth anniversary of the 
Arab Cultural Club. A number of ministers, deputies, and 
political and cultural figures attended the celebration.

entered negotiations after reaching understanding with Arab 
sides. Unfortunately, there are those who have abandoned this 
course or decided to leave these negotiations in return for 
trivial and insignificant things. However, we shall continue 
our coordination, understanding, and solidarity with sister 
Syria until the very end. No one can isolate us, nor will anyone 
be able to take unilateral action against us. 
  [Correspondent] Are there any new developments regarding the 
relationship between the authorities or the Lebanese Army and 
the Resistance men, or is the relationship firm and will it 
continue as it was? 
  [Dallul] We have repeatedly said and I will stress again 
today: Resistance is the right and duty of every citizen who is 
capable of resisting, because it is our right to confront the 
Israeli occupation with all means available to us. There is 
territory occupied by the enemy and there are people, our 
people, who are under this occupation. It is our duty to 
struggle with all available means to end this occupation and 
regain this honorable and sacred land, because it is a cherished 
part of Lebanon. It is an act of treason for anyone to confront 
the Resistance, because it is the highest duty of all. 
  [Correspondent] Therefore, the Resistance operations will 
not stop until the last inch of Lebanese territories is 
liberated? 
  [Dallul] The Resistance knows its duties very well and no 
one can dictate any conditions or stands to it. We, as an 
authority and government, believe that it is the duty of the 
citizens--as happens all over the world, and as was the 
situation in Europe when the German army occupied it and the 
popular resistance started--to resist. It is the duty of the 
sons of all people who are under occupation to resist with all 
the means at their disposal. [end recording]

in al-Sarafand harbor at dawn today. They were owned by 
fishermen Muhammad 'Abbas 'Atwah and Salim 'Ali Hanana. Seven 
months ago an Israeli unit blew up another boat owned by 'Atwah. 
  Elsewhere, Israeli troops stationed in Qal'at al-Shaqif 
fired 
several shells at the al-Litani River basin. Overnight, an RPG 
shell and bursts of 12.7-mm machine-gun fire targeted a UN 
Interim Force in Lebanon [UNIFIL] helicopter as it landed near 
Tallat al-Khazzan, which is opposite the enemy positions in 
Kafra. The helicopter was flying a patient to al-Naqurah. The 
shelling missed the helicopter.

<F P=106> [Interview with King Husayn by CNN's Frank Sesno; place and </F>
date not given; from Amman TV's "60 Minutes" program -- 
recorded, in English with Arabic subtitles] 
  [Text] [Husayn] First of all, I believe that President 
Clinton is very interested in progress on the Jordanian-Israeli 
track, but he is also interested in a comprehensive settlement 
which obviously all of us seek. As far as we are concerned, we 
are just about to embark on the real work that requires the best 
efforts of both sides to resolve all the problems. 
  [Sesno] But if you resolve those issues, and they are many, 
but if you were to resolve them before Syria resolves its 
problems, would you sign a deal with Israel then? 
  [Husayn] I would like to say here that we are not tied to 
anything that happens elsewhere, but we are very anxious to see 
all move, and I like us to see a comprehensive peace. So right 
now, we are focusing on our problems and we are going to address 
these problems with all the attention they require, and I don't 
know how long it will take. Maybe Syria will overtake us before 
we complete our task. But nonetheless we are optimistic and 
hopeful. 
  [Sesno] Maybe you will go first? Maybe Jordan will be the 
first? 
  [Husayn] I hope that they will all come together at a point 
in the very early future. 
  [Sesno] A Jordanian official today was quoted as saying that 
you would plan an October meeting here in Washington with Prime 
Minister Rabin to sign a peace treaty. Is that feasible? 
  [Husayn] I honestly don't know. It all depends on what 
happens in the negotiating process which is about to start. But 
as far as meeting with Prime Minister Rabin, it is not a taboo 
subject. We are negotiating on both sides, and we have been 
doing so for quite a while. So I suppose that everything is 
possible at any time in the future. And it will only be the 
natural thing that [words indistinct]. 
  [Sesno] There have been well-reported secret meetings with 
the Israelis for a long time. Why not a public meeting soon? 
  [Husayn] I think that a public meeting is very feasible, and 
it probably won't take long before that happens, but we want to 
see the beginning of the negotiations. I think that meetings at 
the highest possible levels as well help the negotiating process 
and we'll do so in the future. 
  [Sesno] Where would you like to meet the prime minister? 
  [Husayn] I suppose it will either be here or in our part of 
the world. 
  [Sesno] Soon? 
  [Husayn] I hope before too long, yes. 
  [Sesno] The Islamic Action Front in your parliament is very 
much opposed to a deal with Israel at this time. What political 
price would there be in Jordan for a meeting with the Israeli 
prime minister, and really that is most fundamental for real 
progress toward peace or achieving peace at the official level 
with Israel? 
  [Husayn] I think that peace is inevitably coming. The 
process is irreversible. And regardless of how we view matters 
in Jordan from different perspectives, I believe there is a 
great deal of realism there. 
  [Sesno] So you think there would be presumably political 
opposition, but in the end, the vast majority of Jordanians 
would support this process? 
  [Husayn] It all depends on exactly how it works out and on 
what terms. And obviously it's not peace at any price. It is 
the kind of peace that future generations can live with, 
cherish, and protect. 
  [Sesno] How about the Arab boycott of Israel, the economic 
boycott of Israel. Time for that to end, at what point should 
it switch, be switched off? 
  [Husayn] Frank, I think that it is not understood what the 
boycott implies or means. Secondary and tertiary boycotts are 
almost a thing of the past. But we are suffering a boycott from 
Israel, in point of fact. So this is a subject that has to be 
negotiated and resolved. They are a protectionist country in 
terms of their industries against ours. So all this has to be 
worked out and I think [words indistinct]. 
  [Sesno] As you watch the process unfold in Israel between 
Yasir 'Arafat-the PLO and Israel, is Yasir 'Arafat, as you see 
it now, up to governing? 
  [Husayn] It is something that I can't comment on. I hope 
that he is up to it. I've encouraged Palestinians to stick 
together, to express themselves through unity, and I am sure 
that we have many challenges in the future, maybe amongst them 
the need of Palestinian people for democracy, pluralism, respect 
for human rights, and the need for 'Arafat to be the symbol 
leader. But at the same time for institutions to come up to 
enhance the credibility that is required and needed and for him 
to go back as soon as possible. I hope he does that. All these 
concerns raised with him. 
  [Sesno] You told him: Go back soon. 
  [Husayn] I've suggested that, yes. 
  [Sesno] And you believe that Yasir 'Arafat is, at root, a 
democrat and himself respectful of human rights? 
  [Husayn] I certainly hope that this will be the case in the 
future and that this will manifest itself because it is needed. 
And I believe we will see many changes... 
  [Sesno, interrupting] You sound skeptical? 
  [Husayn] I can't comment on others, Sir, and I won't in this 
instance, but I really hope that he will live up to the 
expectations of the Palestinian people and he has our full 
support and full backing. 
  [Sesno] Finally, Your Majesty, a personal question. You 
came to the United States to go to the Mayo Clinic to see how 
your cancer that you had treated two years ago was doing. How 
is your bill of health? 
  [Husayn] A good bill of health, sir, clean bill of health. 
No trace of cancer after two years, and therefore, no need for 
visits to Mayo beyond regular annual checkup, hopefully from now. 
  [Sesno] Very good news, indeed. 
  [Husayn] Thank you so much. 
  [Sesno] King Husayn, thank you very much for joining me. I 
appreciate it very much. 
  [Husayn] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Talal al-Hasan, minister of state </F>
for foreign affairs, in Amman, by Fayiz al-Miliji, in Cairo; 
date not given; from the "Dialogue from Afar" program -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Miliji] Can you brief us on the most 
important results of his Majesty King Husayn's tour of the 
United States? 
  [Al-Hasan] The Jordanian-U.S. summit meeting was successful 
in the true sense of the word. His Majesty King Hussayn held 
meetings with U.S. President Bill Clinton and the secretaries of 
state, defense, and commerce. He held a meeting with the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee and U.S. congressional leaders. In 
my opinion, the royal visit achieved its objectives of deepening 
bilateral relations. The visit was also a precious opportunity 
which came at the appropriate time to discuss the peace process 
and ways of promoting it so that it would reach its goals of 
achieving a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace in the 
region. In addition, the Jordanian-U.S. Joint Committee held 
its first meeting, during which it conducted a general review of 
the relations in all areas and domains. Naturally, these talks 
resulted in a convergence of views. This undoubtedly will would 
have positive and beneficial effects on the two countries' joint 
interests. 
  [Al-Miliji] Regarding the impact of the visit on 
Jordanian-U.S. relations, was agreement reached on implementing 
joint projects or were certain agreements concluded between the 
two sides? 
  [Al-Hasan] Undoubtedly, the talks held within the framework 
of the joint committee were thorough. They dealt with several 
issues, especially in the economic field. I am confident that 
the indications that emerged from these meetings were positive 
and reassuring. The meetings that were held within the 
framework of the joint committee were fruitful and constructive. 
All issues were discussed in depth and in detail. I am sure 
these talks will have positive effects in all areas and domains. 
  [Al-Miliji] We now move to the results of the Jordanian 
king's visit to the United States in regard to the Middle East 
peace process on its Jordanian-Israeli track. The Jordanian 
monarch's talks in the United States aimed to push forward these 
talks. What was achieved, Mr. Minister? 
  [Al-Hasan] Regarding the peace process, or regarding the 
part of His Majesty King Husayn's visit to the United States 
dealing with this process, the royal visit, in my opinion, was 
an important stage, coming as it did after the activation of the 
formulas for negotiations on the Jordanian track. I am fully 
confident that this development will have a positive and 
tangible effect on all other tracks. This is because 
essentially we all seek a just, lasting, and comprehensive 
peace. We also look forward to achieving joint objectives 
according to a comprehensive view of the peace track. 
  [Al-Miliji] Mr. Minister, let us go back to your statement 
on the activation of the talks on the Jordanian track. What do 
you mean by this phrase? What progress was made on the 
Jordanian-Israeli track in the past phase? 
  [Al-Hasan] Undoubtedly you are aware that the media have 
reported extensively on the progress within the framework of the 
tripartite U.S.-Jordanian-Israeli Committee. Positive results 
were achieved regarding the demarcation of the border, the 
issues of land and security, and other issues pertaining to 
water and the environment. Accordingly, this progress has had 
positive effects on the Jordanian-Israeli track. Therefore, 
there should be real progress regarding all these issues, which 
are a basic part of the agenda approved by the two sides last 
September. 
  [Al-Miliji] Your Excellency, has an agreement been reached 
with Israel concerning the issues of land, security, the 
environment, and borders? 
  [Al-Hasan] An agreement to form a committee has been 
reached. 
In the past Israel had refused to form a committee on the 
demarcation of borders and land. This is an important basic 
issue because it concerns Jordan's sovereignty over its land. 
Therefore, the direct results produced by the tripartite 
committee were represented in the Israeli approval to form this 
committee. This has triggered the real progress to which I 
referred in my previous answer. 
  [Al-Miliji] Did King Husayn of Jordan discuss this issue, 
the 
issue of the land, during his talks in the United States? Did 
he also ask the Israeli side for an understanding on this issue? 
  [Al-Hasan] During His Majesty's meeting with the U.S. 
President and other U.S. officials, the talks focused on the 
peace process and Jordan's principal role in this process, to 
which Jordan is committed with the aim of reaching a just, 
comprehensive, and lasting peace in accordance with the 
Jordanian national constants. His Majesty the King briefed the 
U.S. President and all U.S. officials on Jordan's stand and 
concept regarding this process. The U.S. side showed real 
understanding for His Majesty the King's explanations of these 
issues. The Jordanian stand was received with complete 
satisfaction; and the U.S. side made clear statements, praising 
Jordan's role and adopting the Jordanian viewpoint concerning 
the issues of land, borders, and other things. 
  [Al-Miliji] Your Excellency, can we say that the coming days 
will witness the signing of a peace agreement between Jordan and 
Israel? 
  [Al-Hasan] When all the issues on the agenda--the agenda 
which has been agreed upon and ratified by the two sides--are 
discussed and when all Jordan's demands pertaining to the issues 
of lands, waters, refugees, and other issues that are clearly 
listed on the agenda are met, we will undoubtedly reach, as part 
of a comprehensive agreement, a comprehensive and just peace 
that will be accepted by future generations. 
  [Al-Miliji] At the end of this dialogue, we convey our 
heartfelt thanks to Talal al-Hasan, Jordanian minister of state 
for foreign affairs. Your Excellency is always welcome as a 
guest on the Voice of the Arabs. Thank you. 
  [Al-Hasan] You are welcome.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Information Minister Jawad </F>
al-'Anani, in Washington, by Ashraf 'Abd-al-'Aziz, in Cairo; 
date not given; from the "Dialogue From Afar" program -- live or 
recorded] 
  [Text] ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has 
declared that Egypt welcomes the progress made on the 
Jordanian-Israeli track of the peace talks as much as it 
welcomes the progress on the Palestinian track. On the 
telephone line between Cairo and the U.S. capital, Washington, 
we have Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, Jordanian information minister and 
a member of the delegation accompanying King Husayn to 
Washington. Minister Jawad al-'Anani, welcome to the Voice of 
the Arabs. 
  [Al-'Anani] Good morning and thank you. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Can you tell us about the results of His 
Majesty King Husayn's visit to Washington and his meetings with 
officials from the U.S. Administration? 
  [Al-'Anani] During his three-day visit, His Majesty King 
Husayn met many American officials, foremost among them U.S. 
President Bill Clinton. He also met U.S. Secretary of State 
Christopher, the defense secretary, trade secretary, and 
Congress members from both the House of Representatives and the 
Senate. This visit was important because it followed the 
agreement reached during the tripartite talks in Washington at 
the start of this month on demarcating the Jordanian border 
between Israel and Jordan or agreeing to form a committee to 
demarcate the border and share water fairly. Jordan and Israel 
also agreed on some big projects in the Jordan valley. The 
visit was held to confirm these points. 
  His majesty the king and President Clinton agreed to form a 
bilateral committee between the United States and Jordan to 
discuss economic and political issues between their countries. 
This committee will meet once every six months. Agreement was 
reached within this framework for the United States to offer its 
services to Jordan concerning rescheduling Jordanian foreign 
debts, writing off part of them, and offering American aid and 
aid from other countries that have strong relations with the 
United States to help Jordan continue its economic reform 
programs and restructure the Jordanian economy. Agreement was 
also reached on expanding bilateral trade cooperation, 
especially as the economic balance greatly favors the United 
States. 
  I believe the visit was generally successful. It constituted 
a beginning for cooperation based on mutual respect and 
strengthening the Middle East peace process to serve the 
interests of the region. It also constituted the beginning of 
greater cooperation involving the countries taking part in the 
peace process. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, you have clarified that 
there is a committee to study border demarcation between you and 
Israel. This subject was discussed in Washington. Could we 
pause at the issue of border demarcation between you and Israel 
and present the Arab listener with a general picture of the 
issue? 
  [Al-'Anani] You realize that the joint agenda signed between 
Jordan and Israel on 14 September 1993--one day after the 
agreement for the Israeli-Palestinian Declaration of Principles 
was signed--contained a clear item stipulating that the truce 
borders of 1922, which at the time separated the whole of 
Palestine from Transjordan, are the reference for demarcating 
the border now. Israel occupied some Jordanian territory after 
1967. Jordan has constantly demanded this land back as part of 
the solution and in accordance with Resolution 242, which 
stipulates exchange of land or land for peace. We reached 
agreement that border demarcation should be based on the mandate 
treaty or agreement. This means that Jordan will retrieve its 
land and that the current border with Israel is not 
internationally recognized but is an armistice line. 
  Thus Jordan is the second country after the Arab Republic of 
Egypt to have reached agreement with Israel on a final 
demarcation of the border. A technical committee consisting of 
representatives from both Jordan and Israel will meet at points 
along the border to work on the disputed land to demarcate the 
border, because you cannot demarcate a border from outside the 
area in question. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] There are those who believe that bilateral 
agreements between the Arab countries and Israel are a departure 
from Arab coordination. Is this really the case or should we 
consider bilateral agreements the pillars for realizing a just 
and comprehensive peace in the region? 
  [Al-'Anani] First, the process of coordination is not 
frozen; 
it is constantly moving and is very dynamic. You cannot say 
that I will coordinate today and need not coordinate tomorrow. 
This is not correct. Coordination is necessary under every 
condition and at all times. Jordan has constantly advocated 
coordination and cooperation with its brothers, the Arab parties 
concerned in the negotiating process. Jordan has never failed 
to attend any coordination meeting. Indeed Jordan has always 
called for such meetings. You remember that the cordon states 
ministers meetings--the four negotiating countries including 
Egypt--used to meet periodically before and after each round of 
talks to define, study, and coordinate stances. 
  During these meetings it became clear that the Arab 
parties--the Arab foreign ministers who used to meet--agreed 
that the concept of comprehensive peace does not mean that one 
side cannot move ahead to achieve things on any track. Each 
track has its own specifications and requirements, which might 
not be 100 percent the same as the requirements for the other 
tracks. But the important point is that in the final analysis 
we reach a comprehensive peace agreement on every front, because 
deficiency in the peace process on any track will not see this 
peace be a permanent one. It will make it a fragile peace ready 
to collapse anytime. This is what we agreed on with the U.S. 
side. President Clinton approved this process. I do not 
believe Arab coordination should contend that if one side 
achieves something on its track that would mean it would have 
violated the coordination. We believe coordination becomes 
stronger with such an achievement, which then becomes the 
motivation and objective leading the other tracks to achieve 
similar results. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, Egypt welcomed this 
progress on the Jordanian track. Is there any specific idea on 
an Egyptian role in the coming stage? 
  [Al-'Anani] Of course Egypt played a big role in the peace 
process. To a great extent it participates in the peace process 
on the level of Arab coordination and mediation among some Arab 
sides and the conference cosponsors. Egypt even played an 
important role in mediating between the Palestinian side and 
Israel. And Egypt has an international, African, and Arab role, 
which cannot be ignored, because of the importance of this Arab 
country and its strategic position and significance in political 
and population terms inside the Arab world. We in Jordan 
greatly welcome the statements by Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa and 
other Egyptian officials who expressed their joy at this 
achievement. We believe such a positive spirit should prevail 
in the Arab world so that relations may continue, based on 
encouragement and support rather than hastening to criticize 
situations before knowing the full details. This would squander 
the Arab potential required by the peace process. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, we thank you very much 
and welcome you on the phone line between Cairo and Washington 
on the Voice of the Arabs. 
  [Al-'Anani] I would like to thank you for being very quick 
to 
contact the parties and in learning the facts. I am very happy 
to talk to you and wish you and the Arab Egyptian people much 
success and progress with God's help.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Jordanian Political Activity and Good </F>
Results"] 
  [Text] Some remarkable Jordanian political activity took 
place last week. This activity emphasized Jordan's independent 
character and stressed awareness about Jordan's basic role in 
the peace process. 
  His Majesty King Husayn's visit to the United States and his 
meetings with U.S. President Clinton and senior U.S. officials 
were the major events in this activity. These meetings, whether 
on political and economic levels or on the level of bilateral 
relations, showed that the U.S. side understands the Jordanian 
role in the region as well as Jordan's democratic march and 
respect for human rights. Accordingly, the U.S. officials 
clearly responded to Jordanian demands regarding sovereignty 
over land, rights to water, and completion of the measures 
designed to lift the blockade of al-'Aqabah. 
  In an interview with Radio Monte Carlo yesterday, his 
majesty 
the leader reaffirmed Jordan's eagerness to achieve a just and 
comprehensive peace which returns rights to their owners and 
removes the yolk of occupation from all occupied Arab 
territories. While Jordan is eager to regain its rights, it 
also seeks to promote the peace process on the Palestinian, 
Syrian, and Lebanese tracks. In this regard, his majesty 
indicated he was surprised by some reactions that criticized the 
Jordanian-Israeli agreement. He explained that Jordan has been 
making continuous contacts with the brothers participating in 
the peace process, and that good and acceptable coordination 
exists and continues to be fostered among these parties. 
  With regard to the economic issues, King Husayn said the 
U.S. 
Administration understood Jordan's demands, whether in terms of 
economic aid, indebtedness, or the extension of aid that would 
contribute to constructing and promoting Jordan and securing a 
decent life for the Jordanian citizen, who is our most precious 
property.

<F P=106> [Report by Salamah Ni'mat: "Amman: Reactivation of </F>
Negotiations with Israel Was a Result of the Loss of Hope for 
Real Coordination"] 
  [Text] Amman -- An authoritative Jordanian political 
source said yesterday that Jordan's decision to reactivate its 
negotiations with Israel 32 months after the start of the peace 
process came after a comprehensive reassessment of its strategy 
on the negotiations and the loss of hope for any real 
coordination among the Arab parties concerned. 
  The Jordanian leading figure said that the campaign of doubt 
and criticism launched "by the Syrian and Lebanese media" 
against Jordan "are based on unjustified fears because Jordan is 
committed to the principle of a comprehensive solution on all 
fronts." He pointed out that the PLO's failure to coordinate 
with Jordan and the loss of hope for any such coordination two 
years after the start of the negotiations "makes it Jordan's 
duty to act to protect its strategic interests threatened by the 
repercussions of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement." He also 
said that "the problem of Damascus and Beirut" is that they view 
the progress on the Jordanian-Israeli track "as if it was 
something directed against them without any regard for Jordan's 
internal calculations or Jordanian interests linked to the 
future of the occupied Palestinian territory." 
  He added that it is "unreasonable for Damascus and Beirut to 
view the Jordanian moves from the angle of their own strategic 
interests in isolation from Jordanian interests ,which require 
containment of the likely results of the implementation of the 
agreement on Palestinian autonomy." He stressed that "Syria and 
Lebanon have no right to dictate instructions to us after we 
committed ourselves to a comprehensive solution and called for 
coordination a hundred times in vain." He wondered: "Are we 
supposed not to negotiate while they do? Are we supposed to 
give them trusteeship and let them negotiate our future on our 
behalf?" 
  In reference to Jordanian King Husayn's statements in 
Washington yesterday, the authoritative political source, who is 
close to the royal court, said that Jordan "is a sovereign state 
which only acts in accordance with its own interests and 
convictions, which are not in conflict with the other Arab 
parties," and that all that has happened so far on the 
Jordanian-Israeli track "is agreement to negotiate, not a peace 
treaty as claimed by some press reports. We started in Madrid 
together and we will only sign a peace treaty together." 
  On the fears that progress on the Jordanian negotiation 
track 
might isolate Syria and add to the pressures being brought to 
bear on it in Lebanon, the Jordanian leading figure said that 
his country was still suffering from Arab isolation since the 
Gulf war, and all the Arab parties are responsible for that 
continuous isolation, these doubt campaigns which only push the 
parties further apart, and steps such as the cancelation of the 
meetings of the Jordanian-Syrian Higher Committee.... Who is 
responsible for this distancing? Do they want Jordan to be 
weak, marginalized, isolated, or used by them as a negotiating 
card whenever they want to serve their interests without 
considering our interests?" He reaffirmed the need for 
"building balanced Arab relations based on mutural respect, 
mutual interests, and noninterference in internal affairs and 
matters of sovereignty." 
  He emphasized that Amman "will never give in to regional or 
international pressures, just as it did not give in to the Camp 
David or the Gulf crisis pressures." He recalled the 1973 
Geneva conference "which we attended and Syria boycotted and 
which in the end resulted in a disengagement agreement on the 
Egyptian-Israeli front and paved the way for the Camp David 
agreement and for disengagement on the Syrian-Israeli front, and 
we were left without any agreement because we insisted on the 
implementation of resolution 242."

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin will summon additional 
deliberations on how to curtail PLO efforts to create political 
facts in Jerusalem. Today's meeting on the issue lasted two 
hours and was attended by the prime minister, the foreign 
minister, the police minister, the police chief, the attorney 
general, the Foreign Ministry's legal adviser, and the Shin Bet 
head. Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that there 
is no plan to initiate a comprehensive legislation on the issue, 
but to deal with each case independently. Among steps 
considered are moves to prevent problematic visits to Jerusalem.

<F P=106> [Report by Aluf Ben and Gid'on Alon] </F>
  [Excerpt] The police have arrested a number of East 
Jerusalem residents who attempted to set up a Palestinian police 
framework in the city. The arrests are among the factors behind 
the PLO's "lowered profile" in Jerusalem. This was the 
assessment given by representatives of the security forces in 
their briefings to the political echelon. 
  On 24 June, Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister and defense 
minister, held a debate in a limited forum which focused on 
Palestinian nationalistic activity in Jerusalem. At the 
meeting, it was decided to examine the possibility of passing 
legislation empowering the authorities to close PLO governing 
institutions operating in Israel in contravention of the 
Gaza-Jericho First agreement. The agreement stipulates that 
institutions belonging to the Palestinian Authority will only 
operate within the self-government areas. 
  The Justice Ministry is now preparing legislation amendments 
that will tailor the agreement's clauses to Israeli law. 
According to the proposal, this legislation will include a 
clause on the location of the Palestinian institutions. This 
will permit their closure when deemed necessary. The jurists 
proposed legislation that would have a deterrent effect by 
virtue of its very existence. 
  [Tel Aviv 'AL HAMISHMAR in Hebrew on 26 June in a report by 
Pe'erli Shahar on pages 1 and 8 adds that following the 24 June 
debate at the prime minister's office, it was learned that 
"Israel is looking into the possibility of issuing 
administrative orders that will permit it to close down 
Palestinian institutions in Jerusalem." According to the 
proposal, "administrative orders will for the first time be 
issued against institutions rather than people."] 
  The existing law does not permit the closure of Palestinian 
Authority institutions. During the debate, reservations were 
raised about using the Antiterror Act in order to shut down PLO 
institutions. Although the PLO is still defined as a terrorist 
organization, the Antiterror Act is not employed against it. 
  The meeting at the defense minister's bureau was also 
attended by Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres; Police Minister 
Moshe Shahal; Police Commissioner Asaf Hefetz; the director of 
the Shin Bet; Major General Ze'ev Livne, commander of the Home 
Front Command; Attorney General Mikha'el Ben-Ya'ir; and Foreign 
Ministry legal adviser Yo'el Singer. At the session, security 
sources reported that the PLO had recently "lowered the profile" 
of its activities in East Jerusalem. Nevertheless, the 
statistics bureau for the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which 
works from inside Orient House, is still operating despite 
Israel's demands to relocate the bureau outside the city. 
  Following the discussion, the prime minister said "we shall 
first try to act through a political dialogue; however, we will 
not rule out the possibility of separate legislation in this 
field in the spirit of the Gaza-Jericho First agreement."

  [Text] In addition to the Shamgar Commission report, 
another issue raised in today's cabinet meeting was that of 
Jerusalem, following the prime minister's remarks regarding the 
possibility of the PLO chairman's visiting the city. Minister 
Shetrit spoke about the need to intensify building activity in 
Jerusalem, but the prime minister noted the legal problems 
involved in land confiscation. Minister Bar'am urged that 
Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert not be left out of the picture in 
order to avoid playing into the hands of the extremists in the 
city. Police Minister Shahal complained that Olmert routinely 
fails to appear at meetings of the subcommittee on security 
affairs -- which operates in the framework of the Ministerial 
Committee on Jerusalem Affairs -- but rather sends a different 
representative on his behalf each time. 
  Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that the 
ministers were told that those running the autonomy are 
attempting to spread their authority beyond the regions of Gaza 
and Jericho, and efforts are being made to stop this. 
  The ministers also dealt with the tough living conditions of 
foreign workers in Israel. Minister Peres said it was a mistake 
to bring in workers from abroad. Ministers Peres and Shohat 
criticized Minister Shetrit for encroaching on their ministerial 
spheres.

  [Text] We open with the findings of the Shamgar commission 
of inquiry into the massacre of Muslim worshipers in the Hebron 
Cave of the Patriarchs. The report was just published 30 
minutes ago and its main finding is that Barukh Goldstein acted 
alone. New arrangements are to be introduced for prayers in the 
cave and there will be a complete ban, which applies to soldiers 
as well, on carrying weapons. At the Supreme Court, where the 
Shamgar report was released for publication at 1230 [0930 GMT], 
is Mark Weiss: 
  I am speaking here from the Supreme Court. The report was 
delivered to journalists just half an hour ago: a 350-page 
document, very detailed. We received the conclusions -- some 
30, 40 pages in English -- and as you said, the main conclusion 
is that Dr. Barukh Goldstein's actions were premeditated and 
that he acted alone. Let me quote this important section from 
the document: We were not presented with credible proof that he 
was helped while carrying out the killing or prior to that time 
by another individual acting as an accomplice nor was it proven 
to us that he had secret partners. According to the evidence 
before us, his wife was also not aware of the matter. 
  The report also found no evidence that Goldstein threw a 
hand 
grenade, as claimed by some of the Muslim worshipers, or that 
soldiers fired into the Isaac hall. There is no reliable proof 
of how Goldstein entered the Isaac hall although entry via the 
main entrance or via the Yosifya door are the most likely. 
  Concerning the deployment of security forces in and around 
the cave on the morning of the massacre, the commission 
concludes this, and again I am quoting directly from the report 
in front of me: The absence of the full complement of forces at 
the time of the massacre was an unfortunate coincidence whose 
roots lie both in shortcomings in coordination between the 
forces and in the level of discipline in some of the units. 
  The Shamgar commission also found that if the forces that 
were supposed to be on duty were present then they could have 
impeded Goldstein's efforts to enter the Isaac hall. A lack of 
coordination is noted between the police and IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] units. 
  Regarding opening fire regulations, there is no 
justification 
for different guidelines for opening fire in cases of 
disturbances and criminal offenses. The report here is talking 
about the different guidelines that existed at the time for the 
police and Army. 
  The last conclusion is that the report found serious 
shortcomings in the area of law enforcement in the territories 
and in the absence of effective law enforcement, the report 
says, there could be no effective government. Now those are the 
main conclusions. 
  Briefly to the main recommendations following those 
conclusions. The main recommendation concerns prayer 
arrangements at the mosque. Again I am quoting directly: We 
recommend first and foremost that arrangements intended to 
create complete separation between the Muslim and Jewish 
worshipers be adopted in order to ensure the safety of all 
worshipers, and to prevent friction, dispute, and acts of 
violence. 
  Other recommendations from the findings are that security 
outside the tomb should be provided by a regular army unit while 
the findings recommend the creation of a special tomb guard unit 
that will be responsible for security at the entrance gate and 
inside the tomb. Members of the two units should serve for at 
least a year. The report also recommends an absolute ban on 
individuals carrying weapons entering the tomb. It calls for 
larger police funds to ensure law and order for the Jewish 
residents in the territories and finally recommends that open 
fire instructions be formulated in a clear manner, with 
reference to disturbances and violent offenses.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Hebron Mayor Mustafa al-Natshah by </F>
Jack Katzenell; place not given -- live] 
  [Text] [Katzenell] Let, me ask you this: In view of the 
basic and fundamental conclusions of the Shamgar commission that 
Goldstein acted alone, they have recommended that new 
arrangements for prayers be introduced at the Cave of the 
Patriarchs, and no more weapons are to be carried in the area by 
soldiers as well, is there any reason why you should not accept 
this report? 
  [Al-Natshah] I said that the report must contain more vital 
things, that it did not show that the presence of the settlers 
during the past has created the atmosphere which helped 
Goldstein to commit the crime. The harassment of the settlers 
to the Muslim prayers, and the complaints of a lot of the people 
to the police, was not treated in the proper way and was 
neglected. The Shamgar did not say about this. 
  [Katzenell] Mr. al-Natshah, surely this is not the mandate 
of the Shamgar commission? It was set up in order to 
investigate the massacre of Muslim worshipers in the cave. This 
may be true what you are saying about the background to the 
tension, but it was not required, this is not what it was asked 
to do. 
  [Al-Natshah] Excuse me, but who committed the crime? It is 
not the soldiers, it is the settlers, so you must look at the 
atmosphere which was created in the mosque, that this settler 
has committed a crime. 
  [Katzenell] Mr. al-Natshah, then basically, you do not 
accept the conclusion that Barukh Goldstein acted alone? 
  [Al-Natshah] No, I accept that he did it alone, but I said 
that the atmosphere which was created by his colleagues, the 
settlers, has helped in that he committed the crime. 
  [Katzenell] And you do not believe that his action was in 
fact detached from the atmosphere? 
  [Al-Natshah] The function was alone, that is okay, but the 
atmosphere which was created by the other settlers, I mean the 
harassment which occurred days before, has helped him in 
committing his crime.

  [Excerpts] Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq has expressed 
satisfaction with the Shamgar Commission's findings and said it 
is a comprehensive and in-depth report that relates to the roots 
of the incident and shows what must be done. The chief of staff 
expressed satisfaction with the fact that no steps need be taken 
against Army officers. The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will 
study the findings carefully, and it is still unclear if 
disciplinary measures will be taken against anybody in the IDF. 
In an interview, Lieutenant General Baraq also said the IDF is 
already taking and will continue to take the measures necessary 
to sharply reduce the risk of such events, which have grave 
repercussions for Jews and Arabs, recurring. He stressed, 
however, that he cannot say at present that something like the 
Cave of the Patriarchs massacre could not happen again. 
  Knesset Member [MK] Ori Or, chairman of the Knesset Foreign 
Affairs and Defense Committee, said his committee will make sure 
the report's findings are implemented. He said the true 
background to the incident is the ongoing war in Judaea and 
Samaria. The friction between Jews and Arabs in the Cave of the 
Patriarchs and other places must be reduced and supervision of 
radical Jewish and Arab groups must be tightened. MK Or also 
said the settlement leaders in Judaea and Samaria know that the 
extremists among them are a major affliction and that there are 
those who are under no control whatsoever; therefore, even after 
publication of the Shamgar report's findings, if somebody 
decides to use his weapon, nobody can prevent him from doing so. 
  MK Dedi Zucker, chairman of the Constitution, Law, and 
Justice Committee, criticizes the fact that the commission dealt 
only with the massacre itself and not with law enforcement in 
the territories. I expected the commission to present a sharp 
indictment of the conditions existing for many years in the 
territories, Zucker said. On one hand, the commission says the 
massacre occurred like a bolt of lightning, and on the other, it 
points to the fact that the law was not enforced in the 
territories. There is no police force there to deal with both 
security and civilian matters. How does one reconcile between 
those two aspects? MK Zucker asked, adding that for the most 
part, the Shamgar Commission ignored that connection, which 
means it snowed us. [passage omitted] 
  The Shamgar report was received in Qiryat Arba' with a sigh 
of relief. Local council heads welcomed the fact that the 
findings did not include recommendations to restrict prayer 
arrangements for Jews at the Cave of the Patriarchs. Rabbi 
Moshe Levinger said that if the defense establishment defends 
the Jews, it might be possible to enter the cave unarmed. Our 
settlement affairs correspondent Gil Litman reports that 
according to the Council of Jewish Settlements in Judaea, 
Samaria, and the Gaza Strip, the settlers' stand has been 
strengthened. It has been shown that the action was perpetrated 
by one person, and an entire public should not be blamed. The 
test will be to maintain the Jews' right to worship, the council 
said. [passage omitted] 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1200 GMT on 26 June 
carries a roundup of opposition reactions to the Shamgar 
Commission report compiled by Hayim Hecht, who says that "the 
Likud Knesset faction calls for honoring the conclusions of the 
Shamgar Commission to the letter. A statement issued by the 
Likud says the report proves that the government did not prepare 
properly for preventing extremist acts. The National Religious 
Party [NRP] faction says the commission's conclusions pull the 
rug out from under the feet of those who organized the political 
campaign of incitement against the settlers. The NRP is 
demanding that any changes in prayer arrangements at the Cave of 
the Patriarchs be introduced only with the agreement of the 
chief rabbis. The Tzomet faction emphasizes that the report 
clears the Hebron settlers of any charges. Tzomet Chairman 
Refa'el Eytan says the report suffers from the syndrome of 
putting all the blame on the lowest military levels. The 
Moledet faction is demanding that the Knesset hold a special 
debate on the Shamgar Commission conclusions this week."]

  [Text] Justice Minister David Liba'i says he is at peace 
with his proposal to appoint a national commission of inquiry 
into the Hebron massacre. He says the commission has done a 
thorough job and submitted a balanced report including wise and 
practical recommendations. Minister Liba'i added that to the 
best of his knowledge as a cabinet member, there was no 
forewarning regarding the possibility of a massacre and it was 
impossible to predict. He said the commission's findings 
regarding this issue are of historic significance and he, for 
one, supported the establishment of the commission. Mr. Liba'i 
expects the government to fulfill all the recommendations of the 
commission, which it itself appointed. He further recommends 
that the police, the attorney general, and he himself increase 
their involvement in law enforcement in the territories not only 
when a disaster occurs but also on a routine basis. Minister 
Liba'i was interviewed by our correspondent Mira Amsalem. 
  Ministers Sarid and Shahal say the government must embrace 
the Shamgar Commission recommendations. Yosi Sarid says that 
since it was determined that Goldstein acted alone, there was no 
need for heads to roll. Minister Shahal said more funds must be 
allocated to the police's newly established Judaea and Samaria 
District. 
  The right wing of the political arena welcomes the Shamgar 
recommendations and considers them a boost to the settlers' 
status in the territories, whereas the left wing is disappointed 
by the fact that the commission preferred to deal merely with 
the massacre while ignoring the political, legal, and security 
circumstances in the territories that made the massacre possible. 
  The leaders of the Israeli Arab sector expressed 
disappointment with the Shamgar Commission conclusions. Our 
correspondent Yo'el Dar reports that statements issued by Arab 
Knesset members and mayors say that the recommendations do not 
resolve the complicated situation in Hebron and that the 
settlers must be removed from the city. 
  After the report's publication, HADASH [Democratic Front for 
Peace and Equality] leaders convened in Haifa and stated that 
the only conclusion to be drawn from the report is that all the 
settlers must be evacuated first from Hebron and later from the 
rest of the territories. The HADASH statement says that the 
settlers are a time bomb threatening peace. HADASH believes the 
main cause of the massacre -- namely, the causal connection 
between the prolonged occupation and the massacre -- does not 
appear in the report.

  [Text] A short time ago, the cabinet endorsed the 
recommendations in the Shamgar Commission's report. Yitzhaq 
Rabin, prime minister and defense minister, will convene an 
additional, wide-ranging cabinet meeting soon to discuss 
proposals for implementing the report's recommendations. On 
leaving the cabinet meeting, Minister Yosi Sarid said: 
  [Begin Sarid recording] The cabinet unanimously adopted all 
the recommendations in the report and undertook to implement 
them in full. The cabinet believes the commission performed a 
serious and responsible task, and the cabinet is committed to 
implementing all the commission's findings. The commitment is 
not only to the commission but primarily to the cabinet itself 
and to proper government. 
  [Announcer] We now turn to our political correspondent Udi 
Segal, who heard the prime minister's first reaction to the 
Shamgar report a few minutes ago: 
  [Segal] Prime Minister Rabin has reacted for the first time 
to the Shamgar Commission's conclusions. The prime minister was 
asked for his response, after his initial opposition to the 
establishment of an inquiry commission. Rabin said he does not 
want to delve into the past. We then asked him whether in 
today's reality, a similar massacre can be avoided. This is 
what Rabin had to say: 
  [Begin Rabin recording] If a Jewish madman decides to open 
fire on one of the thousand mosques in Judaea and Samaria or if 
somebody opens fire in the streets of Hebron or anywhere else, 
it could happen again. Theoretically, it could happen, but I 
hope it will not. To the same extent, we cannot give 
100-percent assurances that Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] 
and Islamic Jihad murderers will not continue to attack 
Israelis. We must vow to wage a war to the bitter end against 
the murderers of Israelis and peace and, at the same time, take 
action to impose the law on those Israeli settlers on the fringe 
of society who call for illegal activities and carry them out.

<F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Eytan Rabin] </F>
  [Excerpts] The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] has declared 
alert in its Northern Command and in south Lebanon in 
anticipation of terrorist attacks by Hizballah in the wake of a 
series of IDF operations over the past few weeks. Dozens of 
terrorists were killed in those operations. [passage omitted] 
  Senior Army sources said the IDF continues initiating 
operations against terrorists in south Lebanon. Great 
apprehension prevails among the terrorists, most notably the 
senior ones, who have been sleeping in safe houses away from 
their own homes ever since the abduction of Mustafa al-Dirani. 
  The IDF fears that suicide Hizballah squads will try to 
carry 
out attacks inside the security zone. The attacks may be either 
car bombs or infiltration to Israel through the northern border. 
The IDF has beefed up its patrols in south Lebanon, and troops 
have been instructed to be alert. 
  An SLA [South Lebanese Army] patrol came out unscathed last 
Friday when a powerful bomb exploded as the patrol was moving 
through the western sector last Friday. 
  Army sources have announced that Hizballah's terrorist 
attempts in south Lebanon registered a rise over the past three 
months. One of the sources noted that the recently adopted 
terrorist technique of operating out of houses and the outskirts 
of villages, in which civilian population lives, encumbers the 
IDF activities. In addition to Hizballah's attempts to attack 
the IDF and the SLA, a rise has been noted in similar attempts 
by other bodies, such as Amal and George Habash's organization.

  [Text] Gaza City, Gaza Strip, June 26 (AFP) -- Palestinian 
"ministers" held the first meeting of the new authority on the 
Gaza Strip on Sunday [26 June] to review progress in self-rule, 
officials said. 
  International Cooperation and Planning Minister Nabil Sha'th 
chaired the talks at the old Israeli administration building in 
Gaza City. 
  The session was to be followed by a meeting with 
representatives of the World Bank on the disbursement of 
international aid to the Palestinians, who have criticized the 
lack of readily available funds since autonomy was launched on 
May 4. 
  Sha'th, who negotiated the Cairo agreement which launched 
autonomy, said Saturday that Israel and the PLO would resume 
talks on Tuesday on outstanding questions involving self-rule. 
  These would include the size of the self-rule enclave of 
Jericho and the fate of thousands of Palestinian prisoners as 
well as the spreading of autonomy across the West Bank. 
  But the venue for the negotiations has not been settled and 
Israel, which has suggested Cairo, has not officially announced 
any meeting. 
  Among those attending Sunday were West Bank Fatah leader 
Faysal Husayni, Local Government Minister Sa'ib 'Urayqat and 
Tourism Minister Ilyas Frayj. 
  A press conference was due to be held later in the day.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Major General Nasr Yusuf Tells </F>
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: Self-Rule Police's Problems Due to 
Starvation and Spread of Specialized Gangs Phenomenon"] 
  [Text] Tunis, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Major General Nasr 
Yusuf, commander of Palestinian security and police forces in 
Gaza and Jericho, has said that the Palestinian police are 
currently working in extremely difficult conditions because of 
the huge shortage of resources. He added that no more than 10 
percent of the required resources are available to the security 
forces. 
  Despite all this, Maj. Gen. Yusuf said in a statement to 
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- before his departure from Tunis, returning 
to his work in Gaza, after submitting a comprehensive report to 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat about the security situation 
in the self-rule areas -- that the security situation is good so 
far and that the continuation of this situation depends on good 
performance, the presence of institutions, and laying 
foundations for democracy and political pluralism. He stressed 
that democracy constitutes "the most important factor for 
security, political, and economic stability." 
  Maj. Gen. Yusuf pointed out that the "more marked problems 
facing the Palestinian police are basically the result of the 
spread of starvation in the Gaza Strip. This has led to the 
spread of the phenomenon of gangs specializing in illegal trade 
like hashish, heroin, cocain, and arms." 
  Asked about the presence of large numbers of Palestinians in 
Palestinian jails, Maj. Gen. Yusuf said that there are attempts 
by some quarters to exaggerate the number of Palestinian 
prisoners. He stressed that the real figure does not exceed 20. 
It "is not a large number," and most of the charges raised 
against them are associated with drugs, arms trading, and 
collaboration with Israel. 
  Maj. Gen. Yusuf categorically denied some quarters' rumors 
that these prisoners are subjected to torture and repression. 
He said that "all that has been said in this connection is 
untrue." He invited observers and those interested in human 
rights to visit Hamas member Hani al-'Abid, who was released 
recently, to ascertain whether or not he was tortured. He 
stressed that al-'Abid "was exposed to nothing that harms his 
dignity or humanity." 
  On the extent of Hamas followers' cooperation with the 
Palestinian police, Maj. Gen. Yusuf said that "so far we can say 
that it is possible to have cooperation between us and Hamas in 
the future." 
  Asked about the truth of the accusations leveled at the 
Palestinian police regarding its violation of mosques' sanctity 
and harassment of worshipers, Maj. Yusuf said: "We have not 
closed mosques nor prevented any worshiper from performing his 
religious duty. Mosques are open day and night, and we have not 
issued any instructions to do anything at any mosque. There is 
a campaign against us from forces that do not want stability for 
our people and are working to instigate Palestinian infighting 
and thwart the self-rule experiment." 
  With regard to the issue of collecting the arms from people 
and the Palestinian factions rejecting self-rule, he said: "We 
have not requested the collection of arms, but, rather, the 
control, licensing, and organization of the possession of arms. 
So all citizens are required to seek a license for their arms, 
because we, like any society in the world, can possess arms, but 
within an organized framework lest the arms are used in an 
unsound manner. So we are not talking about collecting arms, but 
controlling them. As for the factions' arms, we have not 
requested them to hand over their arms. We have requested that 
[the possession of] these arms be organized." 
  On Israel's position on the Palestinians' and factions' 
possession of arms, Maj. Gen. Yusuf said: "It is an internal 
affair, because it concerns the organization of arms possession, 
and Israeli society is full of arms."

<F P=106> [Reports by Rafiq Khalil al-Ma'luf in Washington and Randah </F>
Taqiyy al-Din: "Dembri Escalates on Sahara Issue and Does Not 
Rule Out Madani's Release"] 
  [Text] France yesterday reaffirmed its "full solidarity 
with Algeria, calling for a political dialogue in the country 
that would lead to legislative elections as soon as possible." 
Algerian Prime Minister Kokdad Sifi said after a meeting with 
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe that stability in his 
country concerned not only Algeria but also "its close and 
distant neighbors and all Europe." Algerian Foreign Minister 
Mohamed Salah Dembri said that he would not rule out the release 
of Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] Leader Cheikh Abbasi Madani. 
The Algerian minister escalated his country's position on the 
issue of the Western Sahara and warned of the consequences of 
holding a dishonest referendum. 
  At a press conference he held Wednesday evening [22 June] in 
Washington, Dembri said that he discussed with the U.S. 
officials he met with the question of the Sahara crisis, 
particularly the question of support for the UN plan. "We 
discussed the difficulties which appeared in the past few months 
as far as fulfillment of the appropriate prerequisites for an 
impartial and fair referendum, the most important being the 
determination of identity, the number of voters, organization of 
the election campaign, and the required guarantees after the 
referendum. These matters have not been tackled yet. They 
should be tackled in accordance with the Security Council 
resolutions through direct negotiations between Morocco and the 
Polisario. We encourage that. At the same, if the negotiations 
led to a Moroccan-Saharan Evian...why not?" 
  The Algerian minister said that the U.S. side confirmed 
continued "support for the UN plan and for the solution of the 
outstanding problems." 
  Asked about the possibility of an Algerian-Moroccan 
confrontation, he replied that Algeria is a state with 
responsibilities, does not want adventurism over the region's 
stability, and is willing to work for the promotion of the 
necessary solutions "but we warned all parties, including the 
United Nations, that if no impartial referendum is carried 
out...that might lead us to a situation similar to what happened 
in Angola ...." 
  The Algerian minister expressed satisfaction with the 
results 
of his talks with senior officials in Washington, especially 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Presidential National 
Security Adviser Anthony Lake. He said that President Bill 
Clinton's administration showed understanding and support for 
the Algerian Government's reform steps in the political and 
economic fields. 
  He saw "the observations made" by the U.S. side "as part of 
the exchange of views" between the two governments, and said 
that Algeria is not prepared "to seek advice on how to run our 
own home" because that would be "like interference in our 
internal affairs." 
  The Algerian minister confirmed that he explained to the 
U.S. 
side the efforts his government is making "for an open dialogue 
with all on the condition of respect for the constitution, the 
rule of law, the component of the national identity, separation 
of Islam from the political debate, plurality, the republican 
regime, and exclusion of violence as a means of reaching power 
or staying in power." He added that Washington expressed 
support for that and for the expansion of participation, and 
condemned terrorism. He considered that the U.S. criticisms on 
human rights violations were aimed directly at "terrorist 
practices and not the Algerian authorities." 
  He noted that Secretary Christopher expressed the 
administration's satisfaction with the "serious approach" of the 
government and "its way of reviving the election process as soon 
as possible." He added that there was an exchange of views on 
the need to enlarge the circle of dialogue which, he said, "is 
open to everyone without exception, only barring elements who 
take up arms against the rules of the political game." He added 
that the U.S. Administration wished to see "the dialogue 
broadened at the earliest opportunity to ensure the success of 
the political process. That is also our hope. We in Algeria 
are working for broader participation...." 
  He also said that Christopher told him that the U.S. press 
reports of a change in the position of the administration and 
reapprochement with the opposition "did not reflect its 
position." 
  The Algerian official said that he noticed that some U.S. 
officials had misunderstood the facts of what is happening in 
Algeria as some of them still believed that what used to 
happened in the days of the government of Abdesselam Belaid "is 
still happening now." 
  Asked about the possibility of releasing Cheikh Abbasi 
Madani, the Algerian opposition leader, he replied: "Everything 
concerning the issue of the prisoners is possible in a 
democratic regime because that is linked to the powers of the 
head of state. I do not know if there is any possibility in 
this connection but I do not rule out such a possibility...." 
  Asked about the nature of the differences between France and 
the United States on the situation in Algeria, he replied that 
he knew the nature of the U.S.-French differences "but we 
proceed on the basis of: What interests does Algeria have with 
France and what interests does it have with the United States?" 
He said that Algeria occupies the top position among the Arab 
states in terms of trade and economic relations with France, and 
comes third after Saudi Arabia and Egypt in its trade and 
economic relations with the United States. "With the Americans 
and the French we discuss common interests...and we do not waste 
time on the differences. At the same time, when they behave in 
a manner denoting interference in our affairs, we tell them that 
is unacceptable...." 
  In Paris, Mokdad Sifi met on his last day in France with 
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe. 
  After the meeting, which was held at the Quai D'Orsay, the 
French minister said: "We exchanged views on the situation in 
Algeria and the region. I restated to Sifi France's position 
since he became prime minister. It is a position of full 
solidarity with Algeria. We wish Algeria stability because it 
is a part of a region of direct interest to France. We had 
expressed the hope that Algeria would start economic reforms in 
the direction of a market economy. That is now being done. As 
regards the agreements signed with the IMF, they were very 
positive and we have honored our commitments in them. France 
has made large contributions to international and bilateral aid. 
We had also expressed the hope that a political dialogue would 
begin with all parties which agree to join. We have received 
assurances that this is what is happening now. I welcomed the 
fact that the European troika ministers have visited Algeria to 
confirm that position which is also France's position." 
  In reply to a question from AL-HAYAH on the difference 
between the U.S. and the French positions on the situation in 
Algeria, Juppe said: "We discussed this issue with President 
Clinton who recently visited Paris. There was an identity of 
views. President Clinton assured us that he supports the 
stabilization process and the economic reform program in 
Algeria." 
  Asked if Sifi's visit was more economic than political, he 
replied: "There are two aspects to his visit. Stability in 
Algeria depends on the success of the economic reform in 
improving the conditions of the population. The Algerian prime 
minister stressed to us the need to improve the standards of the 
population, provide work opportunities, and improve living 
conditions, but that must be coupled with political dialogue 
with anyone willing to abandon the knives and the Kalashnikovs. 
That should begin quickly in order to lead to legislative 
elections as soon as possible." 
  Sifi said that he agreed with everything Juppe said, and he 
emphasized that he found that "our French partners understand 
our situation and the challenges we face, particularly as they 
have placed Algeria's problem in the broader framework of 
European-Maghreb relations." He aded: "We are satisfied with 
that assessment which was also confirmed to me by the officials 
I met with in Europe. They conveyed to me their multifaceted 
support in all fields to enable Algeria to end its crisis and 
contribute to the region's stability. Stability concerns 
Algeria first but it also concerns its near and distant 
neighbors as well as all Europe."

  [Text] Nicosia, June 24 (AFP)--Iran's main armed opposition 
group, the People's Mujahedeen [Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization, 
MKO] on Friday [24 June] denied it had sent groups into Iran on 
sabotage missions. 
  Iran's chief prosecutor, Ayatollah Abolfazl Musavi Tabrizi, 
said authorities had arrested Mojahedin members "sent from Iraq 
with the aim of carrying out sabotage activities." 
  A Mojahedin spokesman "described these lies as part of the 
regime's stage-managed ploys to attribute the massacre of the 
worshippers of Imam Reza's Shrine to the Mojahedin," according 
to a statement faxed to AFP in Nicosia. 
  A bomb explosion in the northeastern city of Mashhad Monday 
[20 June] left 25 people dead and 70 wounded, Iran's interior 
ministry said. 
  Tabrizi did not say how many were arrested or if they were 
linked to the bombing. 
  The Iranian authorities have repeatedly blamed the 
Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization for cross-border attacks and 
bombing incidents inside the country, including Monday's 
explosion. 
  The rebel group has strongly denied any involvement in the 
bombing.

  [Text] During last night and today the Golboddin-Dostam 
militia fired 255 rockets and shells at Kabul city. A Kabul

<F P=106> [Speech by President Husni Mubarak at the opening of the </F>
National Dialogue Congress at the Presidential Palace in 
Heliopolis, Cairo--live] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the Compassionate, the 
Merciful. Brothers and sisters, members of the National 
Dialogue Conference. This important gathering is a great event 
where Egypt's citizens of various political trends and party 
affiliations are meeting to formulate through their national 
dialogue an integrated Egyptian concept that will strengthen the 
march of democracy, throw light on the priorities of national 
action in this important phase of our history, and draw for 
Egypt a modern image defining the features of its future with 
the beginning of the 21st Century. 
  It is of great significance that this important gathering is 
meeting under the banner of Egyptian patriotism. This gathering 
contains representatives of all society's forces and political 
currents. They will take part in free and clear discussions of 
Egypt's problems and hopes, eschewing their personal interests 
and rising above party ambitions. Their only motive and correct 
goal is to formulate a scientific and objective formula that 
will define for Egypt the position it deserves in a world 
witnessing difficult changes in which there is no place for the 
weak. 
  Our meeting here today under the banner of Egyptian 
patriotism and at the beginning of a congress in which are 
participating this distinguished elite of the spheres of 
culture, thought, politics, and economics proves to all that the 
area of agreement that can encompass all these ideas is much 
bigger than our points of disagreement. This is because our 
national feeling takes precedence over any party affiliation and 
because in our modern age we are facing more complicated 
problems for which it is difficult to find correct solutions in 
the absence of an integrated and comprehensive concept that 
links politics and science in an objective way that rules out 
prejudgment, rigid stands, futile one-upmansship, and insistence 
on specific views that do not take into consideration the facts 
of the situation or the possible capabilities or the necessities 
for compatibility with a new age in which values and concepts 
have changed. 
  Politics is no longer an easy task that can be pursued by 
one 
individual, regardless of how great his capability and 
efficiency. It has become an integrated system of work the aim 
of which is to optimally balance the interests of all the 
sections of the people in order to satisfy them by enhancing the 
society's resources, expanding the base of participation, 
instilling enthusiasm in individuals, and making intelligent 
political decisions through a scientific appraisal of the 
dimensions of situation and its problems. 
  The National Dialogue Congress was formed to achieve this 
objective. Taking part in this congress are a mighty selection 
of politicians and party leaders, professionals, university 
professors, think tank specialists, representatives of 
professional associations and labor unions, members of the 
Specialized National Councils, bankers, economists, and 
businessmen. In the absence of such figures, political dialogue 
would be a futile Byzantine debate, long on rhetoric, short on 
reality and insight. 
  Brothers and sisters, my abiding belief has been and still 
is 
that despite the diversity and multiplicity of political views 
in the national arena, we have enough in common to achieve a 
national reconciliation based on the agreement of all parties on 
the country's supreme interests. 
  We may disagree on the pace of economic reforms, but we all 
agree on the need to open the door, with no restrictions or 
obstacles, to our national financial participation in 
development projects. Increased national investment means more 
job opportunities, less unemployment, and a growing and 
self-reliant economy. 
  We may disagree on the pace of political reform, but we all 
agree that a multiparty system, fair elections, wider popular 
participation, a fair and independent judiciary, freedom of 
opinion and of the press, and an improved human rights 
environment are the underpinnings of true democracy. Our 
democracy should protect itself from those groups that defy 
legitimacy and desire to undermine Egypt's stability and 
democracy. 
  We may disagree on the order of some of the national 
priorities, but we all agree on the need to confront the groups 
of violence and terror in a firm way that safeguards the 
stability of the homeland and respect for legitimacy. We agree 
to preserve national cohesion and social peace, aware as we are 
of the danger involved in ignoring the social dimension of 
development. 
  From this perspective, brothers and sisters, I called for 
the 
formation of a preparatory National Dialogue Committee. My aim 
was to unleash initiative, to initiate a dialogue of the minds, 
and to have all the legitimate and democratic forces participate 
in a comprehensive national dialogue. The task of this dialogue 
is to digest the harvest of the years, evaluate the 
accomplishments of the present, draw up the path of the future, 
and illuminate our passage into the 21st Century. 
  The objective of the dialogue was to obtain an accurate 
assessment of the priorities for national action in light of the 
prerequisites of the comprehensive development. The objective 
behind the dialogue was to enable us to organize and promote the 
effectiveness of the capabilities of the Egyptian human beings, 
energies, and resources so that they could confront the 
challenges of a new era. Furthermore, the objective was to 
ensure the broadest participation in drafting the political 
decisions and at finding sound solutions to the problems of this 
society. 
  We have not put any preconditions to the dialogue 
preparatory 
committee. But we requested that the participants open-mindedly 
realize the nature of the challenges facing Egypt and that they 
be fully aware of the circumstances that govern Egypt's 
international and regional relations. The participants should 
refrain from embarking on any adventures without thinking first, 
as this could harm the homeland's security and stability. 
  We did not want this dialogue to get caught in a vicious 
circle or get lost in a jungle of new problems that could 
plunder the homeland's security and stability. We did not 
prohibit anyone from saying whatever he wants nor did we ask 
anyone to change his ideas and opinions. But we asked everyone 
to enter the dialogue with mature minds and open hearts that 
could create a healthy atmosphere for an objective exchange of 
ideas to safeguard the homeland's interests and preserve its 
coherence. 
  It has always been our hope that the circle of participants 
would expand to include all the democratic and legitimate 
forces, that everyone would rise up to meet their 
responsibility, and that everyone would drop any preconditions 
for the dialogue. This would expand the arena of national 
accord and promote the chances of joint action. This is because 
the dialogue will lose its principal characteristic and all 
justifications if any specific side, including ourselves, tries 
to dictate its opinion to the others without sound reasoning 
that gives them this right and privilege. 
  We always believed that the participation alone would create 
opportunities for consensus. It is participation that could 
pave the way for mutual understanding; and it is the one thing 
that plants the roots of mutual confidence in the soil of 
national action. We are not after booty to be shared. We have 
a huge historic responsibility that cannot be the gambled on. 
  Some people failed to understand our call for dialogue, 
thinking that we were forced into calling for it due to 
pressures resulting from terrorism, violence, or other issues. 
But reality was bigger than that, because the issue of 
terrorism was only one of many factors prompting the honest 
national call, which aims at convincing the opposition that it 
is part of the ruling body, that it must shoulder part of the 
responsibility, and that its ideas can be given appreciation and 
consideration as long as they reflect the national conscience 
and as long as the regime is prepared to accept its views 
because they reflect a broad national accord. 
  These were the dialogue's aims and motives. However, it 
seems that there are those who have miscalculated and imagined 
matters differently. 
  Brothers and sisters, members of the distinguished 
conference. This important gathering could not have taken place 
without good preparation. The preparatory committee has made 
efforts that deserve thanks and compliments. It has completed 
important working papers that organize the method of work in 
this conference of yours and its three committees. I thank the 
committee for the enormous efforts it made throughout four 
sessions that fully gave all its members a chance to put forward 
their views and proposals. I also thank all those who 
participated and contributed their efforts and thought in the 
work of the preparatory committee. Participation means 
acceptance of responsibility. It means respect for the rules of 
the dialogue. It means giving the correct opportunity for 
deepening the exercise of democracy. 
  The fruits of the committee's work was a good example of 
democratic action because it enabled all views to be expressed 
clearly. The representatives of the participating parties 
expressed their parties' views with complete freedom. The 
representatives of professional associations expressed the views 
of their establishments on the many problems and issues of 
national work. All the participating public figures expressed 
their various views without intervention or guidance. 
  The committee's work did not stop at giving a chance to all 
members to express their views in a democratic atmosphere and 
with a feeling of responsibility. It also contained an honest 
and accurate record of all the committee members' proposals and 
recommendations. Your honorable congress will discuss and adopt 
these recommendations. The points of disagreement and agreement 
on all topics under discussion must be made clear to all. This 
is because national consensus is the sound guideline for 
arranging these recommendations according to their priorities 
and for implementing their contents. 
  The preparatory committee's recommendations encompass all 
national action issues, including economic reform, political 
reform, and society's basic problems of developing Egypt's 
manpower capability. Society must become more capable of 
confronting the challenges of the coming age. 
  In many of these issues, it was clear that there was an 
overwhelming tendency reflecting a kind of national consensus. 
In other issues, there was a limited tendency that did not 
reach limits close to unanimity or majority of views. I believe 
all these issues will be discussed by your honorable congress so 
that it will rearrange their priorities in a way that takes into 
consideration the homeland's supreme interests and the degree of 
national consensus enjoyed by these recommendations. Your 
congress must also take into consideration the effect of these 
recommendations on society's cohesion and unity; their social, 
political, and economic cost; and their suitability for 
application and implementation under our local conditions and 
international developments in general. 
  I do not wish to volunteer my opinion on a number of 
important issues raised by the dialogue preparatory committee so 
as not to hamper the free and smooth progress of dialogue in 
your congress. 
  However, I would like to assure everyone that we will 
receive 
the recommendations of this congress with an open mind and will 
take into account every recommendation emanating from national 
consensus, so long as it accords with the general national 
interest. 
  We want this conference to be the right starting point for 
comprehensive work in which all political, democratic, and 
legitimate forces, all of society's forces and institutions, and 
every citizen will take part. Our task, briefly stated, is to 
match rights with obligations, reconcile aspirations with 
abilities, and preserve social cohesion. 
  We have to admit that the true power of any society rests on 
a strong economy driven by a nation fired with enthusiasm and 
eagerness for participation. We also have to admit that we are 
at the threshold of an era in which information and science are 
the decisive factors in national success. 
  I implore God Almighty to guide our steps onto the path of 
righteousness, to endow us with objectivity and enlightenment, 
to let the light of faith permeate our course of reform, and to 
grant us the gift of harmony, cohesion, and solidarity. May 
peace be upon you and the mercy of God. [applause]

improving 
conditions in Kurdistan, which was approved at this meeting and 
which was prepared with the aim of normalizing conditions in 
Kurdistan as mentioned above -- will be presented to the 
Kurdistan Democratic Party, the other parties, and all the 
intellectual sons of our people. This program aims to develop 
life, improve the security situation, and prepare the ground for 
brotherhood and for unity of the people's ranks. 
  On its part, the PUK pledges to the sons of the people to 
exert its utmost efforts to implement the clauses of this 
program. The PUK Political Bureau announces its deep regret for 
the heavy damages incurred on our people which resulted in the 
death of strugglers from both sides who fell victims to these 
regretful incidents. We extend our condolences to the families 
of these incidents' victims and hope that these regretful 
incidents will not recur in the future. 
  [Signed] The PUK Political Bureau, 24 June 1994.

<F P=106> [News conference by Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the </F>
Council of Ministers in South Yemen, with unidentified 
correspondents after Muhammad's meeting with Prime Minister 
Rafiq al-Hariri in Beirut on 24 June--recorded] 
  [Text] [Muhammad] I discussed with his excellency the prime 
minister the latest developments in the current fighting in 
Yemen, and the importance of a serious Arab effort to stop the 
current fighting by recognizing the existing situation in Yemen 
and the existence of two regimes and states. We have been 
unable to establish a true merger during four years of unity. 
We asked Lebanon--government, president, and people--to support 
the justness of our cause. We are defending our right to live 
and the right of our children to stop this destructive war, 
which has entered its eighth week. All types of weapons are 
being used in this war. Sanaa is sending thousands of people 
into this battle to occupy Aden and the south. It is trying to 
impose its will by force and is disregarding domestic and 
foreign will through its military action and option. 
  [Correspondent] Have you made any specific requests to the 
prime minister? 
  [Muhammad] We are asking our Arab brothers and Lebanon for 
their assistance, particularly political, to end the current 
fighting and to recognize Democratic Yemen. 
  [Correspondent] Is there any hope for a cease-fire soon? 
  [Muhammad] We hope so. We pin our hopes on Arab and 
international efforts, particularly on what will take place at 
the UN Security Council in the next two days. We hope the 
results will satisfy the parties and end the bloodshed and 
destructive war. 
  [Correspondent] Will you tour other Arab states? 
  [Muhammad] There are other delegations undertaking the same 
mission both on Arab and international levels. We will also 
make a tour of some Arab areas in the future.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres will meet PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat on 6 July in 
Paris. The three will be there to receive a special UNESCO 
award. During the meeting, political discussions will be held 
on, among other things, the coming stages of the political 
process. 
  Our correspondent notes that several days later, another 
meeting of the donor countries will be held in Paris, and 
'Arafat is expected to attend this meeting as well. Hence, it 
is assumed that 'Arafat will not arrive in Jericho and Gaza 
before mid-July. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is 
also expected in the region at that time.

  [Text] In Islamabad, a spokesman of the Foreign Office has 
welcomed the release of the two British nationals who have been 
kidnapped in Indian-held Kashmir. The Government of Pakistan 
condemns such wanton acts of terrorism, wherever they are 
committed and whosoever is responsible for them. The spokesman 
recalled that the Government of Pakistan had issued several 
public appeals for the release of the kidnapped Britons. Their 
return, safe and unharmed, is a matter of profound relief. The 
spokesman expressed the hope that Britain and other peace-loving 
states would use their influence with India to persuade the 
latter to end its repression in Indian-held Kashmir which is 
undoubtedly responsible for driving the hapless Kashmiris into 
committing such desperate acts.

  [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 25 (AFP) -- Northern Yemeni troops 
cut the coast road between Aden and the oil refinery at Little 
Aden on Saturday [25 June], seriously threatening fuel supplies 
to the city, an AFP correspondent reported. 
  Troops cut the road between the port city and Little Aden, 
18 
kilometres (11 miles) to the west, at the village of Madinat 
al-Sha'b. 
  Southern troops set up a roadblock at the village, which 
lies 
only 10 kilometres (six miles) from Aden, and turned back 
civilian vehicles, saying northern forces were firing at traffic 
on the road. 
  The soldiers said southern troops were trying to push back 
the northern forces. 
  Villagers in Madinat al-Sha'b said the road was cut 
following 
infiltration by northern troops loyal to President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih. 
  When Aden residents heard of the infiltration long queues of 
cars formed outside the city's petrol stations. 
  If northern forces keep the road cut Aden's fuel supplies 
will be seriously jeopardised because tanker trucks will not be 
able to reach the refinery. 
  A southern military spokesman said earlier Saturday that 
northern forces had launched an offensive towards Madinat 
al-Sha'b. 
  Fierce fighting raged around the village and Aden Radio 
transmitters were hit, forcing the radio off the air. 
  War erupted between Salih's forces and those of his southern 
rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid on May 5.

entered Aden's suburbs, occupying on Sunday [26 June] a power 
station and Radio Aden buildings about 10 kilometres (six miles) 
from the city centre, an AFP correspondent reported. 
  The troops broke through southern defences, heading toward 
the bay of Aden late Saturday. The Hiswah power station and 
Radio Aden are on the coast road. 
  Renewed fighting broke a six-hour calm which fell as Sanaa 
declared a ceasefire from midnight. The truce call was 
immediately rejected by leaders in the breakaway south. 
  Northern troops loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih were 
also trying to advance on the Little Aden oil refinery, 18 
kilometres (12 miles) west of the southern stronghold. 
  The south accused the north of taking advantage of a lull in 
fighting to move troops into position for an assault on the 
refinery. 
  Radio Aden stopped all broadcasts late Saturday before the 
northern troops arrived. They were camping out among the 
transmitters on Sunday. 
  They were also installed in the Hiswah power station which 
was put out of action three days ago when a fire broke out there 
after a raid by northern warplanes. 
  Queues of cars formed at Aden petrol stations only to find 
that tanker trucks had been unable to get through roadblocks 
barring the route to the refinery. 
  Civil war broke out in Yemen on May 5 after rival leaders 
failed to resolve differences over running the country. Former 
tribal, conservative North and Marxist South Yemen merged in May 
1990. 
  The south last month proclaimed itself independent.

  [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 26 (AFP) -- Northern Yemeni forces 
killed 16 civilians, including four children, and wounded 45 in 
heavy shelling of the southern port city of Aden Sunday [26 
June], hospital workers said here. 
  The four children died when Katyusha rockets slammed into 
the 
al-Tawahi district near the port. Twenty civilians were wounded 
in the same attack, workers at the Basuhayb military hospital 
said. 
  One of the rockets damaged a house and another exploded near 
a school sheltering displaced people. 
  Earlier workers at the Al-Jumhuriyah hospital said 12 dead 
civilians and 25 wounded had been admitted during the 
bombardment Sunday. 
  Fierce fighting resumed at dawn, shattering a ceasefire 
announced by the Sanaa authorities, and northern troops advanced 
into the western suburbs, seizing the Hiswah power station and 
Radio Aden buildings on the coast road.

  [Text] Aden, 26 Jun -- Northern troops stationed near Aden 
intensified artillery and missile shelling this afternoon 
against many areas in the center of the city, thus violating the 
cease-fire Sanaa authorities had announced would come into 
effect beginning at midnight last night. 
  A southern military communique said today that the shelling 
hit a school in the al-Tawahi area near the port and killed 15 
people, among them women and children who took shelter in the 
school after fleeing the Shaykh 'Uthman area because of heavy 
shelling. 
  The military communique said that the continued northern 
shelling of residential areas and vital installations led to the 
killing of hundreds of people and the wounding of dozens of 
citizens in their homes. It also caused the continued 
disruption of water supplies. [words indistinct] 
  Shelling is still continuing against Aden from the north and 
west, where the northern troops continue their attempts to 
advance toward the city.

  [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 26 (AFP) -- Two civilians were 
killed and two wounded as Katyusha rockets slammed into a 
northern suburb of Aden late Sunday [26 June], hospital workers 
said, bringing the day's toll to 18 dead and 114 wounded. 
  Northern troops fired six Katyusha rockets which exploded in 
the Khormaksar suburb near the airport. 
  The dead and wounded were taken to Aden's main Al-Jumhuriyah 
hospital, which admitted a total of 14 dead civilians and 94 
wounded during the day. 
  Bombardments also continued in the evening at frontlines 
around this southern stronghold, and at the Hiswah power station 
and Aden Radio station occupied by northern forces on Saturday. 
  Earlier four children were killed and 20 people wounded by 
Katyusha rockets in the Tawahi district near the port, workers 
at the Basahib military hospital said. 
  One rocket destroyed a house and another exploded near a 
school where refugee families were sheltering. 
  An earlier toll from hospital workers said 16 civilians were 
killed and 74 wounded as northern Yemeni troops advanced into 
the western suburbs of Aden. 
  Hospital workers said dead and wounded southern soldiers 
were 
admitted during fighting at the Hiswah power station and Aden 
Radio station about 10 kilometres (six miles) from the city 
centre. 
  At least 409 people have been killed and nearly 1,000 
wounded 
in the bombardment of Aden and fighting near the city centre 
since June 11, according to AFP figures based on hospital and 
official sources in the south. 
  War broke out between northern troops loyal to President 
'Ali 
Abdallah Salih and those of his southern rival Ali Salim al-Bid 
on May 5.

most of them young, were killed. 
  The communique said that battles around Aden are still 
raging, and that from dawn till 0900 today the residential

  [Text] Aden, 27 Jun (MENA) -- A Yemeni military source in 
Aden has stated that the northern forces resumed their attempts 
early this morning to advance toward Aden using every kind of 
weapon, including aircraft, and backed by fresh reinforcements 
brought to the various fronts. This large-scale attack on Aden 
took place a few hours after Sanaa made the sixth false 
cease-fire declaration and was accompanied by fierce rocket, 
artillery, and air bombardment against residential areas and 
vital economic installations in Aden. Yesterday's bombardment, 
which extended to schools, mosques, and kindergartens, left at 
least 75 civilians dead, most of them children and women, and 
over 150 others wounded. 
  The ADEN NEWS AGENCY said the armed forces defending Aden 
repulsed the attack and inflicted heavy losses on the forces of 
the ruling military regime in Sanaa. But this regime cares 
about nothing. It does not care about the losses its forces are 
suffering daily. It does not care about the hundreds, even 
thousands, of innocent civilian victims who fall as a result of 
its forces' indiscriminate shelling of Aden. It does not care 
about the appeals made by the local, Arab, and international 
public and the resolutions, appeals, and warnings of 
international legitimacy and the leaders of the fraternal and 
friendly countries, including the latest strong warning to the 
Sanaa regime by the U.S. State Department.

  [Text] The National Defense Council met yesterday under the 
chairmanship of brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council and supreme commander of 
the Armed Forces. The Council discussed several issues and 
national developments on the political, military, security, and 
economic levels and adopted the appropriate decisions. 
  The National Defense Council reiterated that the Republic of 
Yemen is committed to UN Security Council Resolution 924 and is 
responsive to all the good efforts seeking an entrenchment of 
the cease-fire which the rebels who broke away from legitimacy 
violated every time with the aim of internationalizing the 
Yemeni crisis. 
  The Council stressed that the authorities in the Republic of 
Yemen and all units of the Yemeni Armed Forces--forces of unity 
and constitutional legitimacy--are very eager to safeguard and 
spare the blood of civilians in the suburbs of brave Aden and in 
all Yemeni cities and governorates because this is part of their 
national responsibility. 
  In response to the call made by UN Secretary General Dr. 
Butrus-Ghali yesterday; in order to give the rebels a new chance 
to stop fighting and end their rebellion; and in response to all 
good efforts by the brothers and friends to cease fire and solve 
the Yemeni problem through peaceful dialogue within the 
framework of the Republic of Yemen by maintaining unity and 
respecting the constitutional legitimacy; the National Defense 
Council announced a new initiative to entrench the cease-fire as 
of 2400 yesterday, Saturday [2100 GMT on 25 June]. The U.S. and 
French military attaches in the Republic of Yemen will directly 
supervise the cease-fire until the other members of the joint 
military committee arrive. This initiative is a proof of 
credibility and a confirmation of the extent of the Republic of 
Yemen's desire to abide by UN Security Council Resolution 924 in 
letter and spirit.

  [Excerpt] Sanaa, June 25 (AFP) -- Southern Yemeni 
authorities rejected a new Northern ceasefire offer due to come 
into effect at midnight (2100 GMT Saturday [25 June]), after a 
heavy day of fighting around Aden which left at least 11 people 
dead. 
  The "presidential council" of the breakaway southern state 
said the truce declaration made minutes earlier by President 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih was "aimed at buying time and to prepare a 
new offensive." 
  The spokesman said: "Salih, who will never accept a halt in 
fighting, is looking to prepare a new attack." 
  Northern Yemeni authorities earlier said the truce -- the 
fifth declared in the two-month-old civil war -- would be 
supervised initially by the French and U.S. military attaches in 
Sanaa until a joint Yemeni military commission was reactivated. 
  But the southern spokesman rejected this mechanism, saying: 
"As far as the military commission proposed by Sanaa to 
supervise the ceasefire is concerned, we had already rejected 
it." 
  The south has called instead for international observers to 
monitor any accord. 
  Earlier Saturday northern troops cut the coast road between 
Aden and the oil refinery at Little Aden, seriously threatening 
fuel supplies to the besieged southern city, an AFP 
correspondent reported. 
  Southern troops set up a roadblock at the village, which 
lies 
only 10 kilometres (six miles) from Aden, and turned back 
civilian vehicles, saying northern forces were firing at traffic 
on the road. 
  Sources said that if northern forces keep the road cut to 
the 
refinery -- the south's only oil refinery -- Aden's fuel 
supplies will be seriously jeopardised, because tanker trucks 
will not be able to reach it. 
  Long queues of cars formed outside the city's petrol 
stations 
when Aden residents heard of the northern advance along the road. 
  After an uneasy calm overnight, Katyusha rockets slammed 
into 
the northern Aden suburb of Dar Sa'd close to the frontline 
early Saturday, leaving five civilians dead and 30 wounded, 
hospital officials said. 
  Six southern soldiers were also killed and 48 wounded in 
fierce fighting along the frontlines, mainly at Bi'r Ahmad, 15 
kilometres (nine miles) northwest of the city. 
  Attacks around Aden continued late Saturday, a southern 
military spokesman said. 
  But southern forces inflicted "enormous losses in men and 
equipment" on northern troops, the spokesman said on Aden 
television. He said 27 tanks and five military vehicles had 
been destroyed. 
  The latest unsuccessful ceasefire initiative came after a 
meeting of the National Defence Council, chaired by Salih, the 
official northern agency SABA' said. 
  The decision was taken "in response to the call (Friday) by 
UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali" for an immediate 
ceasefire, SABA' said. 
  In all, Sanaa has now declared five ceasefires since June 6. 
But the first four collapsed within hours, with both sides 
blaming each other for renewed fighting. [passage omitted] 
  [Paris AFP in English in a related Aden-datelined item at 
0505 GMT on 26 June adds the following: 
  ["Northern and southern Yemeni artillery units clashed again 
near here early Sunday following a six-hour lull that set in 
after the north announced a ceasefire, correspondents said. 
  ["A southern spokesman accused northern forces of having 
taken advantage of the announced truce to move troops into 
position for an assault on the oil refinery, 18 kilometers (12 
miles) west of here. 
  ["Fresh frighting erupted at 6.00 a.m. (0300 GMT) along 
battle fronts 15 to 30 kilometers (nine to 18 miles) from this 
southern Yemeni stronghold."]

  [Text] A responsible source has stated that the rebels who 
broke away from legitimacy have refused to accept the principles 
that the National Defense Council declared yesterday to observe 
a cease-fire for the sixth time as of 2400 last night, Saturday, 
under the supervision of the U.S. and French military attaches 
in the Republic of Yemen and other members of the joint military 
committee. The initiative was in abidance by UN Security Council 
Resolution 924 and in response to the UN secretary general's 
appeal and the good efforts of brothers and friends. 
  The source said that the outlawed rebels have violated the 
cease-fire, continuing their aggression against the units of our 
Armed Forces--the forces of unity and legitimacy--in Aden and 
Hadhramaut. Since the early hours of this morning, they have 
been subjecting our troops to artillery shelling and launching 
raids against the positions of our Armed Forces, despite the 
full abidance of the forces of unity and legitimacy by 
yesterday's announcement by National Defense Council. The 
source held the separatist rebels responsible for the rejection 
of the new cease-fire initiative, their continued aggression 
against the citizens and our Armed Forces, their failure to 
respond to the UN secretary general's appeal and the good 
efforts of brothers and friends to secure a cease-fire and 
resolve the Yemeni problem through peaceful dialogue within the 
framework of the Republic of Yemen, maintaining unity, and 
respect for the constitutional legitimacy.

  [Text] Acting Prime Minister Dr. Muhammad Sa'id al-'Attar 
has stressed that the rebels against legitimacy are violating 
the cease-fire and seek to internationalize the Yemeni crisis. 
  In an interview with the Jordanian Television Space Channel

guarantee the survival of the cease-fire, which started as of

UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali and the humanitarian appeals 
by the brothers and friends to observe a cease-fire. However, 
the Cabinet received during its extraordinary session a number 
of military reports confirming that the rebels have violated the 
cease-fire. The Cabinet decided to summon the ambassadors of 
the UN Security Council permanent members. The ambassadors were 
briefed on these observations and told that the rebels are not 
serious about responding positively to, or accepting the 
cease-fire decision. 
  Dr. al-'Attar said the rebels continued to attack, with 
aircraft, rockets, and artillery, the forces of unity and 
legitimacy throughout yesterday morning, and inflicted heavy 
human losses on the Armed Forces and the citizens of the areas 
in which these troops are deployed. He stressed that this was 
categorical evidence that the rebels do not want an end to the 
fighting, or Yemen's stability and unity. 
  He said UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali and Brother 
Lakhdar 
Brahimi were contacted and briefed on the situation and the 
rebels' violation of the cease-fire decision. He indicated that 
the forces of unity and legitimacy are abiding by the cease-fire. 
  The acting prime minister said the rebels are searching for 
excuses and justifications to continue their lost battle against 
the victorious forces of unity and legitimacy. 
  He stressed that the entire Yemeni people adhere to unity, 
support legitimacy, and defend their democratic achievements, 
particularly the 27 April 1993 elections, whose fairness and 
success were recognized by the entire world.

  [Text] Aden, 25 Jun (KUNA) -- Aden describes the latest 
cease-fire announced by Sanaa as "a lie," and warned that it 
will not stay with its hands tied facing the continued attacks 
launched by the northern forces on the southern city for a third 
successive day. 
  In the first reaction by the South, 'Abd al-Rahaman 
al-Jafri, 
the vice president of the Democratic Republic of Yemen as 
declared in the South, said that Sanaa's fifth declared 
cease-fire "is a new lie to the international community at a 
time when the U.S. Administration has announced its clear 
position vis-a-vis the continued bombardment of Aden." 
  In an exclusive interview to KUNA, Al-Jafri said that the 
South is awaiting the decisions of the international community 
to save it from annihilation by the North. 
  He added, however, "if the international community and 
particularly the Security Council proves to be incapable, then 
the South has the capability of dealing a decisive and strong 
response to destroy northern areas so that 'Ali Abdallah Salim 
will realise the meaning of shelling Aden and killing its 
children and women." [passage omitted] 
  The city is in total darkness because electricity power 
supplies have been cut as a result of the northern forces' 
shelling today which hit the main electricity generation station 
as well as the radio station.

  [Excerpt] Aden, 26 June -- Northern Yemeni troops resumed 
their artillery shelling of Aden in the south this morning, thus 
breaching the six-hour long cease-fire declared last night. The 
Yemeni news agency Aden quoted a responsible source at the 
Defense Ministry in the self-declared Democratic Republic of 
Yemen as saying: Northern troops resumed their artillery 
shelling of vital economic targets in Aden at 0615 local time.

  [Text] Sanaa, 27 Jun (MENA) -- Yemeni Information Minister 
Hasan al-Lawzi has denied reports claiming that the armed 
forces, "the forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy," 
violated the cease-fire announced the day before yesterday and 
that came into force at midnight on Saturday [25 June]. 
  He told MENA's correspondent in Sanaa that the forces of 
"unity and constitutional legitimacy" fully complied with the 
cease-fire decision on the Aden and Hadhramaut axes according to 
the Defense Ministry's instructions to the commanders of these 
two axes in every sector. But, he added, continuing their line 
of rejecting all national initiatives, the "forces of rebellion" 
resumed their attacks on the armed forces units in several 
places inside Aden. He went on to say that these forces carried 
out air raids on the Bi'r 'Asakir and Sabir Districts of 
Hadhramaut Governorate and on civilian installations in the 
Lahij Governorate's capital city of al-Hawtah. These forces, he 
noted, are continuing their attacks despite all the military 
units' commitment to the cease-fire, patience, and 
nonretaliation in appreciation of UN Secretary General Dr. 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali's appeal and in response to the brothers and 
friends' good offices. 
  The Yemeni information minister told MENA that the "rebels" 
believe their voice can only be heard amid the fighting and 
reports on the fighting. This, he said, prompts them to foil 
every serious effort toward stabilizing the situation without 
achieving even part of a foreign political step to serve their 
illegitimate goals. He noted that these goals have met no clear 
response, only explicit financial backing from a minority and 
propaganda support that the facts will soon reveal. 
  He explained that if the armed forces were not extremely 
concerned about the lives of Aden citizens and civilian and 
economic installations in the city they would have been inside 
Aden city. He said the "renegades" realize this fact before 
anyone else and continue to count on it. He added that the 
armed forces would work to end their use of this, employing 
great patience throughout every violation and attack. He said 
all the state authorities, primarily the people's armed forces, 
will remain extremely concerned for citizens' lives, for the 
Yemeni homeland's economic and trade capital, and for the 
people's gains in the Aden infrastructure.

  [Text] France has reiterated its clear stand in support of 
Yemeni unity. In a memorandum to the Yemeni government on the 
current crisis, France said that it considers Yemeni unity a 
factor of stability in the region and therefore expressed 
reservations over the secessionist declaration. It noted that 
it is paradoxical for the international community to recognize a 
secession resulting from an armed action, given that the 
Republic of Yemen realized its unity through a democratic 
process, a referendum held in May 1991, and legislative 
elections held on 27 April 1993. 
  The memorandum explained the international organization's 
[as 
heard] position on this issue by saying that if the United 
Nations approves such recognition, France fears that the UN's 
credibility will be affected and it will stand bewildered and 
confused when dealing with certain regional crises that are 
similar to the Yemeni crisis; that is, when certain parties 
declare their own establishment such as the Serb Republic in 
Bosnia in the former Yugoslavia for instance. Moreover, France 
does not harbor any hostility. [sentence as heard] 
  In conclusion, the memorandum affirmed support for UN 
secretary general and his special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi. It 
stressed the urgency of calling on all parties to implement the 
cease-fire as stipulated in UN Resolution 924 and convincing 
these parties to continue the dialogue to find a peaceful 
solution.

  [Text] A responsible source has said the Republic of Yemen 
is fully committed to the UN Security Council's call for a 
cease-fire, holding the forces rebelling against the legitimate 
authority fully responsible for the continued cease-fire 
violations. The source said that through their cease-fire 
violations, those forces are jeopardizing innocent citizens' 
lives and seeking to destroy vital and strategic institutions 
and installations throughout the Republic. 
  Referring to the wicked objectives the rebels seek to 
achieve 
through continued military operations, despite the state's 
genuine commitment and practical initiatives in this regard, the 
source explained that the rebels want to internationalize the 
issue in the service of treasonous stands. 
  Meanwhile, the responsible source said the Government of the 
Republic of Yemen is amazed and disturbed by the U.S. State 
Department's official spokesman's statement, which is not based 
on what is actually taking place on the ground. The source said 
the legitimate forces have, in practice, proved their commitment 
to the UN Security Council resolution and that the rebels are 
taking advantage of this commitment to attack legitimate forces 
with all their weapons, something which is testified to by their 
military statements.

  [Text] Brother 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, minister of 
planning and development, currently in Washington, said that 
during his visit to the United States, he met with [name 
indistinct], the assistant U.S. secretary of state, and the 
National Security Council adviser on the Middle East. In a 
statement to the SABA' news agency, al-Iryani said that he 
discussed with U.S. officials several topics related to the 
cease-fire within the framework of UN Security Council 
Resolution 924 which is based on the fact that legitimacy 
belongs to the Republic of Yemen and that nothing else is 
legitimate. 
  Al-Iryani said that Resolution 924 was the key to all 
discussions. He said everybody was eager to realize a 
cease-fire, noting that the National Defense Council's 
cease-fire declaration represents a very important step which 
affirms the credibility of the Republic of Yemen Government's 
commitment to implementing the Security Council resolution.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, Yemeni </F>
minister of planning and development, by Shakir al-Jawhari, in 
Sanaa; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Al-Jawhari] You set a 
condition according to which you rejected 'Ali Salim al-Bid's 
participation in dialogue. You also announced a list of 16 
names with whom dialogue is banned. 
  [Al-Iryani] I am sure that if the other party accepted to 
hold a dialogue as part of the Security Council 
resolution--which stresses Yemen's unity, sovereignty, and 
independence--and also if we faced only the obstacle of banning 
such a dialogue with al-Bid and his group, it would have been 
possible to discuss--and I am not saying to surmount--this 
obstacle. However, this obstacle was preceded by a yet more 
serious obstacle; namely, the other party is not concerned about 
the 16-man list or other lists; it wants to hold a dialogue with 
us in the name of the imaginary Democratic Republic of Yemen. 
  [Al-Jawhari] Do you mean that you are ready to retreat from 
the decision banning dialogue with al-Bid and the 16 people on 
the list? 
  [Al-Iryani] Only after we remove the insurmountable 
obstacle, represented by the other party's rejection of the one 
state and one people. 
  [Al-Jawhari] You thus link your retreat from the decision 
banning dealings with al-Bid and his group to their retreat from 
the secession decision. 
  [Al-Iryani] Exactly. However, I do not have the right to 
determine this matter because it has a legal aspect. But I 
believe that if they retreat from the secession decision this 
issue can be debated. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Jawhari] In light of the outcome of Presidential Council 
member 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani's visit to Beijing, do you 
expect China to veto a new UN Security Council resolution 
against Yemen? 
  [Al-Iryani] The visit showed China's response to, sympathy 
with, and support for Yemeni unity. There is no state which 
says it will use the veto. The decision to use the veto does 
not only depend on the relationship between two states. Such a 
decision is made as part of the rules and principles on which 
the UN Charter is based. 
  [Al-Jawhari] Are you saying that you are ready to hold a 
dialogue with al-Bid again if he retreats from the secession 
decision? 
  [Al-Iryani] Not exactly. I am saying that the condemned 16 
persons are not the obstacle, and that a dialogue with them will 
not be the main problem. The main problem is represented by the 
fact that the secessionists, whether condemned or not, insist on 
holding a dialogue between two states. 
  [Al-Jawhari] In any case, do you not believe that your 
"veto" against a-Bid and the 16-man list ... 
  [Al-Iryani, interrupting] Naturally, as part of the Yemeni 
laws and Constitution, our decision was a "veto" against them. 
  [Al-Jawhari] Do you not believe that this "veto" was hasty 
and that it contributed to creating an atmosphere in favor of 
declaring the secession? 
  [Al-Iryani] Brother, they have been considering secession 
since 1992. 
  [Al-Jawhari] But your positions helped materialize this idea 
into a decision. 
  [Al-Iryani] I swear by God that we helped or appeased them 
for the homeland's sake. The homeland, however, means nothing 
to them. 
  [Al-Jawhari] You now agree to expand the military committee 
and reject their demand to bring in international observers. 
What is the difference between the two? 
  [Al-Iryani] The military committee, which we proposed to 
expand, is the result of a sovereign Yemeni decision. The 
international observers will come by a UN Security Council 
decision that is outside the Yemeni legitimacy and we reject 
this. 
  [Al-Jawhari] Do you fear the results? Do you doubt the 
intentions of the Security Council or the parties that stand 
behind its resolutions? 
  [Al-Iryani] We doubt the intentions of these parties and not 
the Security Council. The parties that seek to have a fresh 
resolution at the Security Council, especially concerning 
international observers, have an illegitimate aim which they are 
trying to realize through legitimate resolutions. 
  [Al-Jawhari] Do the Americans or the Europeans support the 
idea of international observers? 
  [Al-Iryani] No. If you read Pelletreau's remarks several 
days 
ago, you will notice that he said: "I do not think that the 
United Nations is the suitable place for adopting a decision on 
sending observers, we hope that this will be done within an Arab 
or Islamic framework." If this is a firm U.S. attitude, this 
means that there is no justification for the United Nations to 
be a party to this issue. 
  [Al-Jawhari] By the way, to what extent do you trust the 
firmness of the U.S. stand? 
  [Al-Iryani] We deal with things as they appear to us because 
only God knows what is inside the minds. 
  [Al-Jawhari] Have you noticed that the U.S. stand has 
undergone some change in recent weeks? 
  [Al-Iryani] No. The U.S. attitude has been firm from the 
first day of the struggle. It has not changed. 
  [Al-Jawhari] While Sanaa radio says that the United States 
supports unity, Aden radio says that the United States supports 
their demand to stop the fighting and provide protection for 
them. What do you say to that? 
  [Al-Iryani] The U.S. attitude clearly demanded an end to the 
war from the first day. Pelletreau was in Sanaa the day the war 
began, the day the secessionists began the war. He made a 
statement at Sanaa airport and has not changed it so far. 
Americans and non- Americans alike are demanding an end to the 
fighting to protect civilians and not to protect the 
secessionists. This is well known and there is nothing new in 
this regard. 
  [Al-Jawhari] What made you promise the United States not to 
enter Aden? Why did not you promise that you will not enter 
al-Mukalla, for insistence? 
  [Al-Iryani] No, no. Aden is currently taking the limelight 
and everyone talks to us about Aden and not al-Mukalla despite 
the fact that we regard the people of Aden and al-Mukalla to be 
our people. In any case, this does not mean that Aden is 
protected and al-Mukalla is open to attack. For us, the stand 
on the two cities is the same but we do not know why the 
international community's interest is concentrated on Aden. For 
us, Aden and al-Mukalla are the same and we hope that we will 
enter them without fighting. 
  [Al-Jawhari] Don't you believe that the interest in Aden is 
the result of intentions to recognize it as the capital of the 
state that has been announced in the south? 
  [Al-Iryani] I do not rule this out in regard to those who 
support secession. 
  [Al-Jawhari] Do you rule it out in regard to the Americans? 
  [Al-Iryani] So far I have no indications that the Americans 
have such intentions and therefore, I would tend to consider 
this to be a remote possibility rather than a probability. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Al-Jawhari] Before the establishment of unity, you 
received a green light from Washington during the president's 
January 1990 visit to the United States. The U.S. support for 
unity at that time was due to the U.S. conviction that Yemeni 
unity would contribute to realizing stability in the region. Do 
you think that the unity no longer realizes the required 
stability necessary for U.S. interests? 
  [Al-Iryani] I do not think that any right-thinking person 
would venture to say that unity would not lead to stability. 
Any right-thinking man will definitely reject the notion that 
partition would lead to stability. 
  [Al-Jawhari] The question is not exactly like this. Within 
the unity framework, especially after the parliamentary 
election, It was hoped that Yemeni democracy would contribute 
toward containing the Islamists, as happened in Jordan. But 
what happened was that the Islamists' entry into the government 
was represented by the most extremist side; namely, Shaykh 
'Abd-al-Majid al-Zindani, as member of the Presidential Council. 
This man is accused worldwide of being behind terrorist 
operations, whether in Jordan or in Egypt. A Jordanian paper 
said that some of the elements that carried out bombings earlier 
this year received training in a Yemeni camp belonging to 
al-Zindani, who met with the terrorists personally and sent them 
to the training camp? 
  [Al-Iryani] First, I believe that there is no definite proof 
that the reports you cite about al-Zindani are true. 
  In any case, this is your side of the story. I do not 
approve of what you say about Shaykh al-Zindani. Anyway, unity 
safeguards Yemen against any extremism, whether it comes from 
the right or the left. Unity is the safety valve against 
extremism. Those who seek to partition Yemen will not succeed 
in preventing the emergence of extremist movements under the 
canopy of partitioning. But, under unity and democracy, 
extremists will become moderates. I am sure of this. 
  [Al-Jawhari] Do you not believe that the post-war era will 
compel you to realign your local, regional, and international 
alliances and to reassure the countries concerned that Yemen 
will not become another Iran or Sudan in the region? 
  [Al-Iryani] I do not want to go into details I do not know. 
I only want to tell you that Yemen offered endless reassurances 
to its first neighbor. However, these reassurances, 
unfortunately, did not stop the wheel that was already spinning. 
  Yemen does not need to reassure others because it has never 
been a source of danger to anyone. This is in the past and the 
present. As for reassurances for the future, these can be 
guaranteed only under the canopy of unity and democracy. Also, 
we do not need to reassure people because we never scared them. 
You expect reassurances from those who scared you in the past. 
We did not scare anybody. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Jawhari] Do you not believe that if you prosecute Tariq 
al- Fadli now, this could be the best reassurance to neighbor 
countries that you will not encourage fundamentalism? 
  [Al-Iryani] If I were a judge, I would set al-Fadli free 
because the crimes the secessionists have committed are much 
more serious. 
  [Al-Jawhari] This is not a legal precept but a political 
one. 
Under the law, no criminal can be excused because another 
defendant must be put to trial. 
  [Al-Iryani] Al-Fadli was not arrested red-handed. He is only 
accused of instigation, and this too has not been corroborated. 
  [Al-Jawhari] This is because he has not been tried. The 
courts only sentence or acquit people. 
  [Al-Iryani] But what if the authorities themselves resort to 
terrorism as one of their duties, then they deserve to be 
trampled by 20 elephants.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim </F>
Basindwah by Salah Salamah in Paris on 26 June -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Salamah] The latest reports from the war front say 
the northern forces have captured the coastal road that 
separates Aden from the oil refinery and the electricity power 
plant. This means advancing militarily to tighten the siege on 
the capital of southern Yemen. Do you really intend to storm 
Aden and take it militarily? 
  [Basindwah] We do not need to take Aden militarily. Our 
forces, the forces of legitimacy and unity, are in Aden itself. 
We believe that the rebels are now trying to take refuge behind 
the defenseless citizens. The recapturing of these parts of 
Aden did not take place following the cease-fire, but before it. 
I believe that those who want to save the citizens from this 
tribulation should bring new pressure to bear on the remaining 
rebels to give themselves up to the legitimate authorities or to 
leave the homeland for good. 
  [Salamah] Mr. Muhammad Salim Basindwah, the new cease-fire 
agreement, like all previous agreements, did not hold today. 
Who is responsible for the cease-fire violation? 
  [Basindwah] We invited the U.S. and the French military 
attaches and news agency correspondents to go, to look for 
themselves, and to determine which party did not abide by the 
cease-fire and continued to violate this decision. I believe 
that the U.S. and French friends have collected information that 
the forces of legitimacy abided by the cease-fire, which entered 
into force at 2400 last night and that the party that did not 
abide by the cease-fire is the rebel group or those who remain 
from this group and who are taking shelter behind the 
defenseless civilians. 
  [Salamah] It is being said that if the fighting continues 
the 
UN Security Council will issue a new resolution, which was 
drafted by the United Kingdom with the assistance of Saudi 
Arabia, to impose cease-fire by force. What is the position of 
the leadership in Sanaa on the regional and international 
pressure to halt the war and encourage dialogue to seek a 
peaceful solution to the conflict? 
  [Basindwah] We want a cease-fire not because we fear this or 
that party, or the United Nations. We want a cease-fire because 
we are more concerned than others over the lives of women, 
children, the elderly, and the sick. However, things must be 
spelled out. The party that has rejected the cease-fire must be 
specified as well as those who have interests in exacerbating 
the situation. Of course, those who benefit from the exchange 
of fire are the rebels, who believe their end is near. It would 
have been better for them had they surrendered to the legitimate 
authorities or left the homeland when the al-'Anad base fell, 
after they lost the battle. But, they do not want to spare the 
people further tribulation. 
  [Salamah] Some reports published in the Gulf say that about 
18 Arab and European countries are prepared to recognize the 
proclaimed state in south Yemen if the war does not stop. This 
means giving legitimacy to the new situation in the country. 
What is Sanaa's position on the recognition of the southern 
state? 
  [Basindwah] For our part, we are committed to the 
cease-fire. 
I think the U.S. and French military attaches can reaffirm this. 
As for recognition that aims to fragment Yemen, this does not 
harm us at all because the recognition will be one on paper, but 
on the ground unity is an established fact that no one can harm 
or fragment through recognition. We heard in the past about 
governments-in-exile but we have not heard about 
states-in-exile. This, as I believe, will be the first time in 
human history that a state-in-exile is recognized while it has 
no presence on the Yemeni land because, God willing, Yemen will 
remain united. 
  [Salamah] Muhammad Salim Basindwah, President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih has dispatched several envoys to the Arab countries to 
explain the Yemeni position, and the same thing was done by the 
proclaimed government in the south. So far, the Arab efforts 
have failed to stop the war, arrange dialogue, or safeguard 
Yemeni unity. What are the reasons that led to this Arab 
failure, and how can this paralysis in the general Arab position 
on the Yemeni crisis be treated? 
  [Basindwah] Of course, the problem in the Arab situation is 
not a new one. It is an old problem, and we all know its 
reasons. What is important is that Yemeni unity is safeguarded 
and the people who realized the unity on 22 May 1990 are able to 
preserve this unity. Of course, we want the Arab countries to 
help convince the rebels to refrain from bringing more suffering 
to the people and to surrender themselves or to leave the 
homeland. We are confident that it is merely a question of 
time, and the rebels are heading to their end sooner or later. 
I think that the next days will witness their end one after 
another. 
  [Salamah] Muhammad Salim Basindwah, you are in Paris. Have 
you asked the French Government to play a role in expediting the 
resolution of the crisis in Yemen? 
  [Basindwah] I am in Paris on a private visit. I did not meet 
with any officials, but I may return to Paris by the end of this 
week, which begins tomorrow, to meet with French officials. We 
greatly appreciate the just and honorable French position. We 
will continue to be grateful to France for this position, which 
really shows that France is a friendly country, and we will 
always remain keen on our friendship with France. 
  [Salamah] The United States has warned the leadership in 
Sanaa against storming Aden and urged it to withdraw 
emplacements from around the city. Did you contact the U.S. 
Administration after the warning, or are you moving toward an 
open diplomatic confrontation of the United States following 
reports that it is escalating its position? 
  [Basindwah] We are eager to avoid any diplomatic or 
nondiplomatic confrontation with the United States and any other 
party. But I would like to tell you that our eagerness not to 
storm Aden is not due to fear from that or this state. Rather, 
it is due to our concern about the bloodshed and property of the 
sons of our people inside the city of Aden. As you know, when 
the rebels lost the battle on the various battlefronts, they 
took refuge in the city of Aden and used the unarmed families as 
shields. Of course, we cannot expose the citizens to killing, 
but we pin great hope on the them that they will expel these 
rebels from their ranks and prevent them from using families as 
shields. There is no need to storm Aden militarily. We are 
completely confident that the citizens themselves will help the 
legitimate forces spread the state's authority over all the 
governorate of Aden and inside Aden quarters without resorting 
to armed force, God willing. 
  [Salamah] So, the war will continue, and you still reject 
regional and international pressures and setting conditions for 
a dialogue with officials from the south. As a result, there is 
a suffocating crisis from which no hint of a solution in the 
country is seen. What are the available opportunities to 
achieve a political settlement in Yemen apart from this 
destructive war? 
  [Basindwah] There is no problem at all in reaching a 
solution 
if only the world can be convinced that there is a group of 
rebels that wants to disrupt Yemen's unity and does not want to 
bow to order, law, and constitutional legitimacy. The other 
sides are required to persuade this rebellious, renegade group 
to hand itself over to the legitimate authority and have a fair 
trial or to leave the homeland and let people live in peace. 
You know that the government in Yemen is legitimate and derives 
its legitimacy from the free and fair elections held on 27 April 
of last year. The world recognized the results of these 
elections, and even the rebels themselves accepted them before 
declaring their rebellion. 
  I can't see any government that came to power following 
fair and free elections allowing any of its citizens to foment a 
state of rebellion against it. It doesn't stand to reason that 
the international community should extend recognition to the 
rebels as a state or authority. We have not done anything 
wrong, nor perpetrated any crime. All that we want is for law 
and order to prevail throughout Yemen and for the rebels to 
bring their rebellion to a halt, then everything will be fine. 
  [Salamah] Do you think this will open the road to dialogue 
and to a return to a harmonious relationship, without anyone 
standing trial? 
  [Basindwah] I don't think it is right to be lenient toward 
those who have caused hundreds of civilians and soldiers to be 
martyred or wounded in the hostilities. Who is the culprit? 
The culprits must be held accountable for what they have done. 
It is not right just to let things pass without the guilty 
party being called to account. There are unionist elements 
within the [Yemeni] Socialist Party and these have had no hand 
in what has happened. We have nothing against them and they are 
welcome to resume their positions. All of us will reach out to 
them. 
  [Salamah] Would you name names? 
  [Basindwah] I know many of them, but I would rather not name 
names now, if only not to embarrass them. 
  [Salamah] Thank you for being with us, Foreign Minister 
Muhammad Salim Basindwah of Yemen. 
  [Basindwah] I thank you and Radio Monte Carlo.

  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister brother 'Abd-al-Wahhab 
al-Anisi returned to Sanaa from Doha this evening at the end of 
a visit that lasted several days during which he held talks with 
officials in the sisterly State of Qatar dealing with bilateral 
relations and developments in the Yemeni arena. 
  In a statement to the Yemeni News Agency, SABA', the brother 
deputy prime minister said his visit to Doha came within the 
framework of continuous contacts and coordination between the 
Republic of Yemen and the State of Qatar in the interest of the 
fraternal state and the Arab and Islamic nations. 
  He added that he conveyed the greetings and appreciation of 
the political leadership and the Yemeni people to the leadership 
of the State of Qatar and its fraternal people. He hailed the 
principled and firm Qatari support for unity and legitimacy, and 
hoped that Qatar will be an example for other Gulf Cooperation 
Council states in particular, and Arab and world countries in 
general in its support for right and the Yemeni people's will. 
  Concluding his statement, the brother deputy prime minister 
stressed that the Yemeni people will not forget the principled 
support for it during the current critical circumstances.

<F P=106> [From the "Issues and Events" program] </F>
  [Text] The symbols of the rebellious and secessionist gang 
indulge in the hope that they will achieve their separatist 
objectives with the presence of international forces. 
Therefore, they, as well as their supporters, propagate this 
issue to the sides that they contact. However, they forget an 
important fact; namely, this will never happen. This is because 
what is taking place in our country is a conflict between 
constitutional legitimacy and the separatists, the minority that 
is rebelling against constitutional legitimacy and violating 
laws and the national Yemeni consensus. 
  Needless to say, those who (?will try) to bring in 
international (?forces) to Yemen must be aware that Yemen is a 
unified political entity, the Republic of Yemen was recognized 
by all countries in the world, and what is taking place in Yemen 
is a purely Yemeni affair. We accepted Security Council 
Resolution 924 calling for a cease-fire and abided by it. 
Meanwhile, it was violated many times by the separatists. And 
we accepted the idea of dialogue with the nonseparatists in the 
[Yemeni] Socialist Party to tackle [words indistinct] 
differences out of respect for the Security Council, which aims 
at stopping the bloodshed, tackling the Yemeni problem within 
the framework of Yemeni unity, and underscoring the fact North 
and South Yemen are one. Accepting dialogue does not mean at 
all that it will be with the separatists under any circumstances. 
  The government of constitutional legitimacy reiterates its 
commitment to the cease-fire. However, the band of separatist, 
which is shedding crocodile tears and [word indistinct] calls 
for stopping bloodshed and ending the fighting, is the one which 
never abided by the cease-fire. It aims, through the 
continuation of fighting, at bringing in international forces, 
as it wishes. It depends in this on its active supporters. 
However, all permanent members of the Security Council and all 
countries in the world know full well that adopting such a step 
will not approved under the UN Charter or the rules of the 
international law. (?Dispatching) international forces is 
required to stop a war between two or more countries. [sentence 
indistinct] However, the Republic of Yemen is a sovereign state 
which enjoys (?stability). The deviation of a gang from 
constitutional legitimacy and it defiance of the will of people 
and national consensus are not an excuse (?for foreign 
interference,) including by UN forces. 
  As we have said, the UN forces did not intervene [words 
indistinct] the forces of any country chasing and fighting the 
rebels from its own sons [words indistinct]. The gang of 
rebellion and secession should [words indistinct] there will be 
no international forces in Yemen. The separatists believe that 
the presence of such forces will help them achieve their 
criminal objective; namely, separation. 
  We would like to say that the UN Charter and international 
law do not permit in any case sending any foreign forces to the 
Republic of Yemen, the unified political entity, because what is 
taking place in it are legitimate operations by the forces of 
constitutional legitimacy against a gang of [word indistinct] 
traitors, and outlaws who worked to undermine security and 
stability in exchange for destructive money so as to divide 
Yemen -- land and people. This is certainly impossible.

  [Text] Sanaa, 25 Jun (MENA) -- Informed sources in Sanaa 
have told MENA's correspondent that Yemeni opposition parties 
will submit an initiative to stop the grinding war that has 
entered its eighth week between rival sides in Yemen. 
  These sources explained that the initiative calls for an 
immediate cease-fire, an unconditional dialogue, cancellation of 
all resolutions and measures that have resulted from the war and 
from the declaration of session, and for compliance with the 
Pledge and Accord Document as a basis for dialogue. 
  The initiative also calls for forming a military committee 
comprising of all the political forces to supervise the 
cease-fire. It notes that resuming dialogue is the only way out 
of the Yemeni crisis and the only way to protect Yemen's unity. 
  Yemeni sources affirmed that the initiative enjoys the 
interest of Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and the Yemeni 
Socialist Party's unionist leaders. 
  The Yemeni opposition parties include the Nationalist Forces 
Federation and the National Grouping of Opposition, which is 
comprised of the Right Party, the Yemeni Unionist Group, the 
League of the Sons of Yemen, the Nasirite Unionist Organization, 
the National Democratic Front, the Arab Socialist Ba'th 
Party--Yemen's branch, the Democratic September Organization, 
and the Nasirite Popular Reform Party.

  [Text] The higher committee for receiving donations met 
yesterday under Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zindani, Presidential 
Council member and the committee's chairman. The committee 
members discussed a number of issues on the committee's agenda 
which aim at activating the higher committee's work and 
expanding its activity outside the homeland in a bid to allow 
our expatriate citizens to join in the honor of participating in 
the popular move to support the efforts to defend unity and 
constitutional legitimacy. In order to achieve that goal, the 
higher committee for receiving donations set up a committee to 
contact the brother expatriates in sisterly and friendly states. 
  In a related development, Brother Judge Hamid al-Hitar, 
member of the higher committee for receiving donations and head 
of the health care committee, said in statements to the Yemeni 
News Agency, SABA', that a medical convoy yesterday left for the 
governorates of al-Bayda' and Abyan, with a shipment of 
medicines and supplies needed by the hospitals in the two 
governorates to enable them to offer medical services and full 
health care.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with 'Ali Salim al-Bid, "president of </F>
the Democratic Republic of Yemen," in Hadhramaut, by MBC news 
reader Nicole Tannuri in London, on 26 May -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Tannuri] 'Ali Salim al-Bid, president of the 
Democratic Republic of Yemen, has stated that international 
recognition of his republic is a matter of time. This was 
stated in an exclusive telephone interview conducted by the MBC 
center today. In the beginning we asked al-Bid about the reasons 
for the failure of all the cease-fire agreements. 
  [Al-Bid] The leadership in Sanaa has chosen the course of 
war. It insists on not stopping the war [words indistinct]. 
Therefore, it only resorts to this course to achieve its 
objective. However, this is a dead end and they cannot achieve 
anything. 
  [Tannuri] The UN Security Council denounced the northern 
shelling of south Yemen. The Council might issue a resolution 
on sending UN forces to Yemen. What is your stand on this? 
  [Al-Bid] We always support international legitimacy. We 
supported Security Council Resolution 924. We will always 
support international legitimacy because we aspire to stability 
and peace for us and for everyone. However, we do not expect 
Sanaa to respond positively. The mentality of the leadership in 
Sanaa is different. We highly appraise the recent U.S. position 
which contains a clear warning. However, we hope this will be 
followed by tangible steps that will translate words on paper 
into real action. I believe the Sanaa regime will not stop. 
[words indistinct] What does 'Ali 'Abdallah want to do to 
Yemen? 
  [Tannuri] Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, do you have any 
indications that some states will recognize your declared state? 
  [Al-Bid] Regarding recognition, we are there on the spot. 
We are fighting for the third month. [words indistinct] We 
are there. Our relations and contacts are continuing with 
several fraternal and friendly states. I am confident that the 
world will deal with reality. This steadfast people in Aden and 
all the parts of the Democratic Republic of Yemen deserve 
recognition. They will acquire recognition deservedly through 
more steadfastness and sacrifice.

  [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 26 (AFP) -- Southern Yemeni leader 
'Ali Salim al-Bid spoke Sunday with the heads of state of Saudi 
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Syria to discuss the 
conflict in Yemen, Aden television said. 
  Al-Bid contacted Saudi King Fahd, Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al 
Nuhayyan of the UAE and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad by 
telephone as northern forces launched a new intensive 
bombardment of this southern stronghold. 
  He told them of "the persistence of the military regime in 
Sanaa" in continuing the war, and its "repeated violations of UN 
Security Council Resolution 924 which called for an immediate 
ceasefire," the television said. 
  Fighting raged Sunday in the suburbs of Aden, following the 
collapse of the fifth ceasefire to be announced in the 
two-month-old civil war. 
  The Arab leaders expressed concern at continued fighting and 
called for an immediate truce, the television reported. 
  War broke out on May 5 between al-Bid's southern forces and 
those of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, ending four years of 
uneasy unity since former conservative, tribal North Yemen 
merged with the Marxist South.

<F P=106> [Interview with Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, "prime minister </F>
of the Democratic Republic of Yemen," by Khalil Matar in New 
York; date not given] 
  [Text] [Matar] Can you assess your current tour, and what 
have you achieved in it? 
  [Al-'Attas] As you know, we met today with Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali and his representative Lakhdar Brahimi. We also 
met with the Security Council chairman, Oman's representative 
Ambassador Salim al-Khusaybi, and a group of the council's 
members. During these meetings we explained our views regarding 
conditions in Yemen. Discussions focused primarily on an 
immediate cease-fire and a halt to the bloodshed, especially as 
northern forces have recently focused on civilians, hitting 
primarily residential areas, social establishments, schools, 
hospitals, markets, and mosques. 
  Then we discussed the need to secure an effective mechanism 
to watch and consolidate the cease-fire. 
  As for the second issue which was discussed, it is the need 
for humanitarian aid for our people, especially in Aden 
Governorate, where people are suffering water and electricity 
cuts and the disruption of health services and other life 
necessities. I can say that the talks were positive. I hope 
that our meetings with these and other parties will continue in 
order for the council to adopt resolutions to implement 
Resolution 924. 
  I would like also to say that we expressed our complete 
willingness to accept a cease-fire without any conditions, to 
agree on a suitable mechanism, and to engage in the dialogue 
stipulated by the Security Council resolution. 
  [Matar] But as Sanaa is intransigent and is refusing to 
engage in a dialogue with you, how will you be able to secure a 
formula acceptable to the northern government? 
  [Al-'Attas] I believe that there is no justification for 
Sanaa to reject a cease-fire or accept one and then try to get 
around it. We have always stressed that the war is harmful and 
undermining unity. It is also aimed at (hitting) democracy and 
the development march in Yemen. As you have been following 
developments in the war, you know how Sanaa began to hit vital 
economic installations, starting with the historic Aden 
refinery, which is a vital installation, among others. Sanaa's 
position is not patriotic and does not reflect a humanitarian 
position toward the Yemeni people. This is why I am confident 
that the international and Arab position is capable of 
compelling Sanaa to return to the right path. 
  I said at the beginning of the war, and I repeat it now, 
that 
the courageous and patriotic decision required now is to 
announce a cease-fire. 
  [Matar] Is there any possibility of returning to unity? 
  [Al-'Attas] War severs all ties, and the longer it goes on, 
the fewer ties will remain. This is why we have since the war 
broke out said that the road the Sanaa leadership has been 
following is wrong and detrimental to unity and the Yemeni 
people. It is also harmful to the Yemeni people's future and 
life and to the fraternal bonds and ties among the one Yemeni 
people. This is why we should confront what results from this 
unity courageously and with patriotic responsibility. [sentence 
as published] 
  [Matar] Can you explain to us what exactly is required so 
that there can be a possibility of returning to unity? 
  [Al-'Attas] I believe that we as a Yemeni people in the 
north and the south need a period of time to recover from the 
effects of this war. 
  [Matar] Does mean that the war has affected the general 
popular position on unity, whether or not 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
remains in power? 
  [Al-'Attas] The war has affected everything. It is bringing 
nothing but tragedies. The Yemeni people know that this war is 
not imposed by the Yemeni people. It is imposed by an 
influential tribal-military group in Sanaa. In Sanaa itself 
people say this war is the Hashid tribe's war, not the people's 
war. 
  When fatwas [rulings] are issued -- repudiating the 
cease-fire, analyzing the reasons for continuing the war, and 
considering whatever is seized as war booty -- it means that 
they consider the south their booty. You can imagine the 
reaction of all our people in both the north and the south when 
they hear such statements. I would like to recall some events 
in our history and say that today is similar to yesterday. In 
the imam's days fatwas like these were issued. So today is like 
yesterday. The mentality which harmed unity and advocated the 
annexation of the south to the north is still in control. It is 
a view of hegemony and domination among that group. 
  [Matar] Some time ago you pointed to the arrest of some 
Iraqi military personnel who were fighting alongside northern 
forces. You also spoke about the north's alliances with 
fundamentalist parties, and so on. How do you view these links 
and how do you prove they exist? 
  [Al-'Attas] Sanaa is currently clearly allying with Iraq and 
fundamentalists. It is seeking to set up a new axis and new 
powers in the region in order to become a source of disruption 
for the region's security and the security of the Arab homeland 
as a whole. And as Yemen represents a strategic position on Bab 
el Mandeb, Sanaa could -- then -- disrupt world security. 
  The Iraqi role has increased recently, and a number of 
people 
were arrested during one of the battles. These Iraqis come 
under various names like teachers, engineers, health assistants, 
and so on. And there is now among northern forces a number of 
Iraqi experts. 
  As for the fundamentalist movement's role, it is increasing 
in Sanaa. And this represents 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's other face 
in his numerous alliances. In our view, these alliances pose a 
threat not only to Yemen, but to the region and its stability as 
well. 
  [Matar] And did you sense any U.S. understanding of this 
threat? 
  [Al-'Attas] There is understanding...yes, there is 
understanding and awareness of what is happening. 
  [Matar] The U.S. State Department's statement, which 
considered the bombardment of Aden a violation of Resolution 
924, represents a change in the U.S. position. But this change 
remains slow with regard to recognizing the Democratic Republic 
of Yemen and confronting the government in Sanaa. Will this 
change continue? 
  [Al-'Attas] I believe that the U.S. position has from the 
outset been positive and balanced. And the U.S. Adminstration's 
focus on securing and consolidating a cease-fire is a good step. 
Washington actually believes that unity cannot be imposed by 
force. It also says that no decision on Yemen's future can be 
taken in war conditions. It is a balanced position. But 
regrettably, the other side in Sanaa has not responded to it. 
It has continued the war despite the Security Council 
resolution. 
  As for the administration saying that the bombardment of 
Aden 
represents a violation of the resolution, it is a big 
development in the U.S. position, which is balanced and 
consistent with its positions since the crisis broke out. I 
expect the U.S. position to develop in the same direction until 
a real and complete cease-fire has been imposed -- a cease-fire 
that allows a peaceful dialogue between the two sides to tackle 
political conditions. 
  [Matar] Will the U.S. position reach the stage of 
recognizing you officially? 
  [Al-'Attas] I believe that the main mission discussed 
between us and the Security Council members is the cease-fire. 
  [Matar] Why has not a single state recognized you openly? 
  [Al-'Attas] Because the main mission is the cease-fire.

<F P=106> [Report by Munsif al-Sulaymi: "Salim Salih Tells AL-SHARQ </F>
AL-AWSAT: Hassan II's Reception Pleased Us, We Believe 
Recognition Exists Tacitly"] 
  [Excerpts] Rabat -- Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the 
south Yemen Presidential Council and assistant secretary general 
of the Socialist Party, has described Moroccan King Hassan II's 
reception of the South Yemen delegation the evening of the day 
before yesterday as "very useful, and it pleased us." [passage 
omitted] 
  On the possibility of Morocco's recognizing the proclaimed 
Democratic Republic of Yemen, especially as official Moroccan 
media services have said that the Moroccan monarch received the 
delegation of the "Democratic Republic of Yemen" [DRY], Salim 
Salih said that "the question of Morocco's recognition [of the 
DRY] tacitly exists, proceeding from our status prior to four 
years of unity which has proved difficult to achieve. Proof of 
this is the existence of two armies, two establishments, two 
currencies, and two regimes." [passage omitted] 
  On his assessment of the causes of the failure of the 
endeavors made by the international envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, he 
said that "we have always responded to all the initiatives, most 
importantly the U.S. and European initiatives. We sought to 
interact with the proposals presented. But most regrettably, 
the other party is focusing on one option -- war, which has 
entered its eighth week and yet has not achieved what the Sanaa 
regime wanted to achieve." [passage omitted] 
  On the prospects for the dialogue with Sanaa regarding a 
mechanism to halt the fighting and how this mechanism can be 
agreed, as the idea was initially endorsed at the Cairo meetings 
headed by Brahimi, he said: I believe that "the other side does 
not at all want to reach clear and specific results regarding a 
cease-fire and choosing the right path. All it is doing is 
getting around the resolutions by giving others the impression 
that it has accepted the resolutions." [passage omitted] 
  Salim Salih Muhammad said that Sanaa has offered no sign or 
hope of withdrawing its forces besieging Aden. He expected the 
war to continue for a long time. He expressed his hope that 
sanctions would be imposed on the side not complying with the 
resolutions of the international will and pushing the region 
into the furnaces of real dangers that threaten security and 
stability. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Brother 'Abdallah 'Abd-al-Majid al-Asnaj, foreign 
affairs minister of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, said 
recognizing the Democratic Republic of Yemen has become a matter 
of time, and was neither a difficult, nor an impossible matter. 
  In an interview with the Lebanese AL-ANWAR, Brother 
'Abdallah 
al-Asnaj expected that recognizing the Democratic Republic of 
Yemen could take place in a few days, not weeks. 
  Brother al-Asnaj accused the rulers of Sanaa of waging a 
barbaric war against the southerners with the aim of occupying 
the south.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Staff Major General Haytham Qasim </F>
Tahir, former defense minister of the Republic of Yemen and 
present "defense minister of the Democratic Republic of Yemen" 
and member of the Political Bureau of the Yemeni Socialist 
Party, by Salih al-Qallab; place and date not given -- published 
in conjunction with London AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] 
  [Text] [Al-Qallab] The northern forces advanced on all axes 
while your forces are still on the defensive. What are the real 
reasons for this? 
  [Tahir] The other party in Sanaa has fully prepared for the 
war over a long period of time. The treacherous attacks on our 
units in the north were practical "rehearsals" for this war. 
Moreover, the regime in Sanaa has thrown in all the army and 
tens of thousands of armed tribes that are loyal to this regime 
and to 'Abdallah Bin- Husayn al-Ahmar. It also mobilized the 
entire human and material resources of the state in this war. 
  As for us, we confronted this all-out war with modest human 
and material resources because the balance of power between us 
and them is no more than one to 10. This means every 10 
brigades by Sanaa will be met by only one brigade on our side. 
For example, 7,500 troops attacked our (southern) 650-strong 3d 
Armored Brigade, which was stationed in the outskirts of Sanaa. 
Nevertheless, this war has failed to achieve its strategic 
objectives. As you may know, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his 
advisers had planned to settle accounts with what they termed 
"separatists" in two or three days. 
  [Al-Qallab] Why were you late in your reply at the start of 
the war, especially after the destruction of your brigades in 
the north? Were you not expecting a northern military action of 
such magnitude? 
  [Tahir] In fact, and as you have said, we never expected 
'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih to go so far as to launch an all-out war against 
our people. The war began by attacking and annihilating our 
brigades in the north and then by storming our borders from four 
directions. This was accompanied by random artillery, missile, 
and air bombardment of villages, houses, and schools. Vital 
economic installations like the Aden refineries, water and power 
stations, and secure residential areas were also bombed. 
  Actually, we had a bitter experience with 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih, from whom we saw nothing but maneuvers. We were also not 
prepared for this war which was imposed on us. Nevertheless, 
our Armed Forces and people confronted the aggressors in all 
governorates after it became certain that the aim of the war is 
occupation and domination of the south, something which has 
never been accomplished. The war is entering its 50th day and 
the steadfastness of our people and forces is, in all criteria, 
considered victory. 
  [Al-Qallab] You spoke about Sudanese and Iraqi participation 
in the fighting against you, but you did not prove that through 
prisoners, equipment, or other evidence. 
  [Tahir] There is absolutely no doubt about the participation 
of Iraq and Sudan in this war on the side of the regime in 
Sanaa. There are Iraqi military experts and soldiers fighting 
with the northern forces. Some of them were captured at Shabwah 
axis. There was audio and visual news media coverage of this 
subject. I can confirm to you that the war launched against us 
is totally run by Iraqi expertise. Sudan is also directly or 
indirectly participating in this war, thus proceeding from the 
declared alliance between the two regimes in Sanaa and 
Khartoum--an alliance in which the extremists play a basic and 
decisive role. The "Arab Afghan" groups are also fighting with 
the northern forces. 
  [Al-Qallab] Is it true that there are northern penetrations 
in your ranks? 
  [Tahir] It is quite natural for the so-called penetrations 
to 
occur, not only in our ranks, but also in the ranks of the 
northern forces. The reason is that we were one state. As for 
us, we did not think with a conspiratorial mentality or work 
with intelligence methods as the other party did. In any case, 
this had no impact on our forces' combat position on the fronts. 
The war the other party triggered against our people was an 
all-out war which was opposed by all not only in the south but 
also in the north as well as in the Arab homeland and the entire 
world. Matters have become clear and the war is no longer a war 
against "rebels" or "separatists" as Sanaa media rumored. It 
emerged as a war against en entire people and state, which is 
the Democratic Republic of Yemen. 
  [Al-Qallab] Does President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih want 
indeed to see Aden fall, or did he intend to pressure you on 
that front in order to keep your forces in this area so that he 
can divert his attention to the oil-rich region of Shabwah? 
  [Tahir] 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih cannot take Aden or occupy the 
oil-rich areas in Shabwah. The only thing he could do was to 
bring about further damage and destruction in Yemen, murder more 
innocent civilians, and destroy the northern and southern 
armies. Events since the eruption of fighting on 27 April 
confirmed that this is a losing war in which there will be no 
victors. Certainly, the results of this war will be against the 
wishes of those who ignited it. 
  [Al-Qallab] The northerners are accusing you of receiving 
military aid from certain neighboring states. How true are 
these accusations? 
  [Tahir] These accusations are merely propaganda aimed at 
diverting attention from the aid which the other party is 
receiving from a number of states. Foreign media and diplomatic 
sources revealed on several occasions the names of these states. 
  [Al-Qallab] It is well known that you use Soviet and 
eastern- bloc weapons in general. How have you managed during 
the war, especially with spare parts? 
  [Tahir] We have sufficient weapons and equipment to defend 
ourselves and the sovereignty of our state. 
  [Al-Qallab] If there was a cease-fire, how will you deal 
with the issue of the Democratic Republic of Yemen's territory 
occupied by the northern troops during the war? 
  [Tahir] The cease-fire is no longer a Yemeni issue, but an 
international one, according to UN Security Council Resolution 
924 which was only adopted after 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih refused to 
heed the calls of reason and logic and all the Arab appeals and 
initiatives to stop this war, which aims at murder and 
destruction. We have presented an initiative to set up a team of 
international observers to monitor the cease-fire and the 
withdrawal of the northern troops to the positions they occupied 
before the fighting started. Here, I wish to stress that we 
will not relinquish a single inch of the Democratic Republic of 
Yemen's territory. 
  [Al-Qallab] Do you think things will stop at that point if a 
cease-fire goes into effect, or will the war take another shape? 
  [Tahir] This war was imposed on us by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
and his regime. We are defending ourselves and our people's 
right to a dignified, free life without any humiliation or 
submission. Our people have chosen their own future and path by 
supporting the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Yemen 
which is based on law and order and respect for human rights. 
  [Al-Qallab] Since you are the defense minister and aware of 
many things, who do you think is planning and running the 
operations on the northern side? 
  [Tahir] I was the defense minister of the Republic of Yemen 
and I am now the defense minister of the Democratic Republic of 
Yemen. I know that the military regime in Sanaa has long ago 
planned this all-out war against our people in the Democratic 
Republic of Yemen. I know that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's advisers 
and Iraqi military experts have planned and run the military 
operations against our people. Their schemes, however, failed, 
or, at least, were not implemented according to plan. They only 
succeeded in inflicting further human losses and destroy and 
sabotage the economic infrastructure in the northern and 
southern parts of Yemen. 
  [Al-Qallab] What are the real losses in men and equipment? 
  [Tahir] If we are talking about military losses within the 
southern army, these are very small and limited, despite the 
acts of treachery against our units that were based in the 
north. As for civilians, there were great losses because the 
battles were fought on our land and because the northern troops 
deliberately and indiscriminately bombarded, with rockets and 
artillery and from the air, the towns and villages, including 
the capital Aden, leaving hundreds of dead and wounded among the 
innocent, defenseless people. 
  You can be certain that the civilian losses on the northern 
side are very small because from the beginning, our forces were 
eager not to hit the cities and residential areas in the north. 
As for the military, the northern troops suffered major losses, 
which I estimate at scores of thousands of dead and wounded. 
This is because our forces were in a defensive position while 
the other troops were attacking. Furthermore, the Sanaa regime 
was throwing in scores of thousands of untrained young men who 
had no faith in this losing war. 
  [Al-Qallab] Why did the northern forces bombard southern 
airports and vital targets at a time when you ceased to attack 
the northern airports, although you bombarded Sanaa airport at 
the beginning of the fighting? 
  [Tahir] We did not bombard Sanaa airport. We only bombarded 
military targets in this airport and scored accurate hits on the 
first day of war. We did not bombard any vital, economic, or 
service targets, contrary to the northern forces which 
indiscriminately attacked power and water stations, oil 
refineries, schools, hospitals, and residential areas. All 
northern air raids and attacks, however, did not score any 
worthwhile hits against our military targets despite the Iraqi 
and other foreign expertise and aid. 
  [Al-Qallab] Is it true that the northerners are pushing you 
to declare a state in Hadhramaut, so they can turn Aden into a 
free zone and annex the governorates captured by the northern 
forces? 
  [Tahir] There is no doubt about it. The Sanaa regime's talk 
about legitimacy and unity is an exposed media and political 
deception. However, I assert to you that our people will 
courageously and valiantly resist and will defend every inch of 
the Democratic Republic of Yemen. 
  [Al-Qallab] What proposal on unity will you accept, now that 
the previous formula has failed and resulted in this devastating 
war? 
  [Tahir] It is difficult to discuss any formula for a unity 
with Sanaa's military regime which slaughtered unity and wanted 
to annihilate our people and occupy their territory. 
  [Al-Qallab] Why has there thus far been no Arab recognition 
of you? Does this mean that you entered the war without having 
made good calculations and good assessment of the situation? 
  [Tahir] What we care about is that our people have chosen 
their path, and the steadfastness of our Armed Forces and people 
in a devastating total war for almost two months calls for 
pride. This is the real recognition of our existence as an 
independent state on the ground. The Arab and international 
recognition will be made on this basis soon. 
  With regard to saying that we entered the war without good 
calculations, we actually did not enter this war. It was 
imposed on us, and they planned this war without our knowledge. 
However, their calculations were wrong because they announced 
that they would finish it in two or three days. But the war has 
been raging for approximately 60 days, which means that their 
calculations were wrong although they planned this war. 
  [Al-Qallab] Why did 'Ali Salim al-Bid move to Hadhramaut? 
Does this mean that you believed that Aden would fall? 
  [Tahir] The presence of brother (President) 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid in Hadhramaut was part of a plan to distribute the 
political leadership members among the governorates and areas in 
order to lead and guide the defensive and tactical actions on 
various battlefronts, especially since the Sanaa regime aimed to 
occupy all southern governorates, which now constitute the 
Democratic Republic of Yemen. 
  In any case, brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid has accomplished his 
mission and he is now in Aden. Meanwhile, other leadership 
members are still distributed among the governorates, and some 
others are on diplomatic and political missions abroad.

  [Text] London, 27 Jun -- In an interview published here 
today, a prominent southern Yemeni official affirmed: "The issue 
of a cease-fire is no longer a Yemeni issue but an international 
one according to UN Security Council Resolution No. 924." 
  Staff Brigadier Haytham Qasim Tahir, appointed as Defense 
Minister in the Democratic Republic of Yemen, which was 
unilaterally announced in south Yemen on 20 May, told Al-SHARQ 
AL-AWSAT in a telephone interview: "We have presented an 
initiative to form an international observer team to monitor 
implementation of the cease-fire and the withdrawal of northern 
troops to their position prior to the eruption of the fighting." 
He stressed he would "Not give up one inch of the lands of the 
Democratic Republic of Yemen." 
  He described human, weapons and equipment losses as being 
"small and limited among the military circles in the southern 
army. As for the civilians, the losses are great because the 
battles took place on our lands and because northern troops 
launched a deliberate random and barbaric missile, air and 
artillery attacks on towns and villages, including the capital 
Aden, which caused the death and wounding of hundreds of 
defenseless and innocent people."

<F P=106> [Statement issued by "a responsible source at the Presidency </F>
Council"; place and date not given] 
  [Text] From the first moment, the Democratic Republic of 
Yemen has accepted the Security Council Resolution 924, and that 
the Sanaa regime was the one which refused to accept and 
actually adhere to the Security Council's resolution and all the 
international and Arab initiatives and appeals as evidenced by 
its attacks [passage indistinct] and that what the Democratic 
Republic of Yemen was doing was to defend itself and its 
citizens. 
  Therefore, we welcome the Security Council's decision issued 
last night and announce our commitment to it. [Passage 
indistinct] our right to defend ourselves and our citizens 
against [passage indistinct] be it on the battle fronts or on 
the innocent civilian citizens in Aden which the forces of the 
north shell them with all types of weapon of destruction in 
front of the whole world. 
  The question which exists today is about this unjustified 
delay in [passage indistinct] brother Lakhdar Brahimi's meetings. 
  We have accepted brother Lakhdar Brahimi's initiative to 
hold 
talks with the other side without conditions, and it became 
clear to his excellency and to the world that the other side was 
the one which was putting conditions [passage indistinct]. 
  Once more, we accept the contents of the Security Council's 
statement in an immediate cease-fire and the holding of 
unconditional talks under the auspices of the United Nations. 
  At the same time, we do not want our acceptance to be taken 
either by the Security Council as a reason to postpone taking 
the necessary measures to implement its resolution, nor by the 
international sides to postpone recognizing the Democratic 
Republic of Yemen, which was established to stay, and which our 
people have sacrificed hundreds of martyrs to defend it [passage 
indistinct], or for our acceptance to be taken as usual to give 
more time to the Sanaa regime to continue usurping our lands 
[passage indistinct] and our vital installations. This 
aggression [words indistinct] Arab and international community. 
  The presidency council in the Democratic Republic of Yemen 
felt proud and exalted by this steadfastness which the history 
of our region has never witnessed anything similar, the high 
morale and the readiness to offer sacrifices [passage 
indistinct] aggression.

  [Excerpt] Aden, 26 Jun -- A responsible source in Aden 
today accused the "rulers of Sanaa of violating the cease-fire 
they announced last night." At the same time, he called on the 
international community to adopt sanctions on the northern side 
in Yemen for continuing to violate the cease-fire. 
  In a statement to KUNA here today, the source said that the 
northern forces have shelled the residential areas of 
al-Mansurah, Shaykh 'Uthman, and Khormaksar this morning, and 
pointed out the death and wounding of numerous people. 
  The source called on the UN Security Council to adopt 
sanctions against Sanaa for continuing to violate the cease-fire. 
  The northern artillery bombardment has resumed at an earlier 
hour this morning thereby putting an end to a cease-fire that 
lasted for few hours when Sanaa announced it would adhere to it 
from midnight last night. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Abu Dhabi, June 26 (AFP) -- Omani Foreign 
Minister Yusuf Bin-'Alawi 'Abdallah called Sunday [26 June] on 
behalf of the six Gulf states for a halt to the civil war in 
Yemen. 
  "The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries are eager to 
see Yemeni brothers put an end to their destructive war," 
'Abdallah said during a stopover in Abu Dhabi. 
  'Abdallah met with his United Arab Emirates counterpart 
Shaykh Hamdan Bin-Zayid Al Nuhayyan following a meeting in 
Jeddah with Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal. 
  'Abdallah said: "It is up to the Yemenis to decide" their 
future, referring to the south's declaration of the breakaway 
Yemen Democratic Republic on May 21. 
  The secession was implicitly recognised by five members of 
the GCC -- Oman, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrein and Kuwait -- 
which said unity could not be imposed by force. 
  'Abdallah said the UN Security Council, currently chaired by 
Oman, is examining a draft resolution on Yemen. 
  "The project is the subject of consultations between the 
five 
permanent members of the Security Council," he said without 
elaborating. 
  Oman and Saudi Arabia played a key role in the adoption of 
UN 
Security Council Resolution 924 of June 1, which called for an 
immediate ceasefire. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Aden, Yemen, June 26 (AFP) -- Aden has enough oil 
stocks to last several weeks despite being cut off from its 
refinery, a senior southern Yemeni official said Sunday [26 
June]. 
  "We have lots of oil tanks in Aden," said Muhammad Raji, 
secretary-general of the Oil Ministry of the self-proclaimed 
Yemen Democratic Republic. "The supplies can last several 
weeks." 
  Oil reserves at the Little Aden oil refinery, 18 kilometres 
(12 miles) west of the southern stronghold, were moved to Aden 
after northern warplanes attacked the refinery, causing a major 
fire, Raji told AFP. 
  Northern troops loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih were 
trying to advance on the refinery Sunday after cutting the coast 
road west of Aden. 
  Electricity has been rationed in Aden for the past three 
days 
since the city's main power station at al-Hiswah, about 10 
kilometres (six miles) away, was damaged by fire following a 
northern bombardment. 
  Northern troops were occupying the power station Sunday. 
  But Raji said the southern authorities were using two other 
power stations, in the northern suburb of al-Mansurah and Khur 
Maksar, near the airport. They had enough fuel for up to two 
weeks. 
  Queues of cars formed at Aden petrol stations Saturday, but 
tanker trucks were unable to get through roadblocks barring the 
route to the refinery. 
  Raji said the authorities could still bring oil into the 
city 
by sea from the al-Mukalla oil terminal in the Hadhramaut 
region, 700 kilometres (434 miles) east of Aden. 
  "The situation is manageable," he said. 
  Petrol stations had instructions only to fill up vehicles' 
tanks, not jerry cans. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Maher Chmaytelli] </F>
  [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 24 (AFP) -- Four civilians were 
killed and 32 people wounded Friday [24 June] as northern troops 
kept up their blitz of Aden, advancing steadily through southern 
defences. 
  Katyusha rockets slammed into the districts of Khur Maksar 
close to Aden airport, Ma'allah near the port and Shaykh 'Uthman 
in the northern suburbs, killing four people and wounding 28 
others, hospital officials said. 
  In fierce fighting on the northwest front at B'ir Ahmad, 15 
kilometres (nine miles) from Aden, four soldiers were wounded, 
they added. 
  Northern troops, who have kept up a barrage of rockets and 
artillery fire on the southern stronghold for more than a week, 
advanced overnight into the town of Bi'r Ahmad after seizing the 
entrance on Thursday, an AFP correspondent reported. 
  Fighting had died down earlier Friday but southern troops 
were massing armoured cars to launch a counter-offensive on 
their northern rivals loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. 
  At least 113 civilians have now been killed and about 400 
wounded since the north unleashed its assault on the city last 
Thursday, according to a toll by hospital officials. 
  Thirty people, mostly civilians, were killed and close to 
150 
wounded on Thursday as rocket and artillery fire rained on the 
city in the fiercest day of shelling so far. 
  In Aden residents still have to queue up at 72 wells for 
water, even though southern authorities have managed to 
reconnect supplies from the main pumping station at Bi'r Nasir, 
close to the northern front, hit by northern fire several days 
ago. 
  International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) officials 
said water supplies were "vulnerable" to contamination. 
  They are helping the city authorities install proper pumps, 
so residents do not throw plastic containers directly into the 
water supply. 
  Both the ICRC and a spokeswoman for Medecins Sans Frontieres 
said there were no signs of any epidemics breaking out in the 
city. 
  By advancing from the northwest, northern troops are hoping 
to cut off Aden from the power station in Hiswah, 10 kilometres 
(six miles) from Aden and the oil refinery at Little Aden, 15 
kilometres (nine miles) from the city. 
  Military sources said the south had inflicted heavy losses 
on 
northern troops at Bi'r Ahmad, where "a large number" had been 
killed, 23 tanks destroyed and another seven captured. 
  The rival troops exchanged artillery fire on all fronts 
round 
the embattled city, but southern warplanes continued taking off 
from the airport, despite the shelling. 
  A military spokesman in the city said two northern missiles 
fired on "economic targets" were blown up by southern 
anti-aircraft fire. 
  Meanwhile, southern leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid was holding 
more 
meetings with tribal leaders in a bid to get them to help repel 
the northern forces. 
  On Thursday southern leaders pleaded for foreign 
intervention 
to break the tightening stranglehold on Aden. 
  They said the north was violating a UN ceasefire call 
adopted 
in a Security Council resolution on June 1. 
  Northern Planning Minister 'Abd-al Karim al-Iryani left 
Sanaa 
Thursday for New York, where he is to meet with UN Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to discuss the situation in Aden. 
  UN special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi failed to broker a 
ceasefire 
in a 10-day tour of the region. 
  Four ceasefires have collapsed since the war erupted on May 
5, shattering a four-year uneasy union between the former 
tribal, conservative North Yemen and the Marxist South.

  [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 24 (AFP) -- A relentless northern 
Yemeni blitz on the city of Aden has killed 376 civilians and 
wounded 861 since June 11, according to a toll compiled by 
southern authorities and obtained Friday by AFP. 
  The toll by the interior ministry of the breakaway south 
covered the whole governorate of Aden, the city's suburbs and 
areas close to the frontlines about 20 kilometers (12 miles) 
from the southern stronghold. 
  Intense bombing of Aden started on June 11. The civil war 
erupted between rival northern and southern forces on May 5. 
  On Friday four civilians were killed and 32 wounded when 
rockets and shells fell on several districts of the besieged 
city, hospital officials said.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by "a responsible source at the Ministry </F>

not given] 
  [Text] The forces of the ruling military regime in Sanaa 
have been continuing since yesterday morning [words indistinct] 
and continued their artillery and rocket attacks [words 
indistinct] and residential quarters in the city of Aden [words 
indistinct]. 
  Yesterday the ruling military regime of Sanaa initiated 
battles around Aden by means of its (?brutal) forces and used 
all kinds of destructive weapons. However, our Armed Forces and 
the masses of our people were lying in wait for the brutal 
enemy. They engaged the enemy with rare courage and legendary 
steadfastness and inflicted on the invading and aggressive 
forces crushing blows. 
  They prevented the advance of the enemy forces and inflicted 
on them the following losses: the destruction of 25 tanks; 12 
manned military vehicles, as well as other weaponry and 
equipment. They seized seven tanks. The enemy also suffered 
hundreds of dead and wounded. 
  One of those taken prisoner by our forces said that the 
commanders of the destructive war against our people told them 
that the first commander of a tank who manages to enter Aden 
will be appointed governor of Aden. He also said other things 
which we do not need to talk about now. 
  This morning the forces of the ruling military regime in 
Sanaa resumed their aggressive operations and their repeated 
attempts at attacks. The battles are still continuing. The 
morale of our forces is high and their confidence in victory is 
unlimited. God is great.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the "Presidential Council of the </F>
Democratic Republic of Yemen" on 23 June; place not given] 
  [Text] The Sanaa regime continues to challenge the 
international community, all values, and all ethics. Each time 
it claims that it is accepting the decision of the UN Security 
Council Resolution No. 924, it simultaneously prepares for a new 
offensive. The Sanaa regime has continued to launch successive 
attacks on our defensive lines around Aden, and the intensity 
and ferocity of these attacks have increased since 17 June. 
  There have been 14 attacks so far, and for each attack they 
have brought in more reinforcements. Our brave forces and the 
sons of our people have repulsed these attacks, which aim at the 
occupation and humiliation of the land and the people's honor. 
In every attack the Sanaa regime launches missiles and 
artillery against innocent citizens and vital installations. 
Since 17 June the number of casualties, dead, and wounded has 
totaled 800 people, most of whom are women, children, and the 
elderly. 
  The Sanaa regime early this morning began an attack on the 
battle lines, but is being resisted with heroism and bravery. 
At the same time it has been shelling residential areas in the 
quarters of al-Shaykh Uthman, al-Mansurah and Dar Sa'd since 
this morning. Innocent citizens are being killed and wounded. 
The Sanaa regime is also shelling vital installations such as 
the desalination plant, the power station, the fire station, and 
the refinery. 
  The Sanaa regime is wrong in believing that its killing of 
citizens and destruction of homes and vital installations will 
weaken the morale of the sons of our people and force them to 
prostrate themselves before occupation and humiliation. The 
sons of our people prefer to die bravely in defense of their 
homeland and the protection of their women's honor, than to 
prostrate and humble themselves before a regime which does not 
believe in ideals and does not respect people. It is a regime 
which is not interested in law or legitimacy, whether religious, 
Arab, or international. 
  In the name of the Democratic Republic of Yemen we announce 
to the fraternal Arab countries and the international community 
that the Sanaa regime will not uphold any pledge or commitment 
it makes to them. It aims to occupy, destroy, loot, pillage, 
and dishonor. 
  Diplomatic advice is achieving nothing, except to give more 
time to the Sanaa regime to continue with its attempts at the 
malicious destruction of our people, and Aden in particular. 
  For this reason we wish to stress what we said in our 
previous appeal, and the need to take deterrent measures to 
compel the Sanaa regime to heed the resolutions of the 
international community and respect human rights. As for our 
people, they will not submit, and will resist the aggressors 
with all the strength available to them. God is with us, and 
those who do wrong should know what kind of end they will suffer.

  [Text] The forces of the ruling military regime in Sanaa 
continued today their desperate offensive attempts to advance in 
the direction of Aden at a time when they continued to shell the 
residential quarters and the vital economic installations, such 
as water and electricity plants for (?no reason). 
  Our brave Armed Forces confronted these [word indistinct] 
desperate offensive attempts which have not inflicted any 
worthwhile losses on our forces, but have caused losses among 
the innocent civilian population -- from among the children, 
women and old men -- as a result of the barbaric, random 
bombardment of the residential quarters. 
  During today's battles, which continue even as we prepare 
this communique, the enemy incurred the following losses: the 
destruction of 12 tanks and three hostile military teams, and 
hundreds of dead and wounded among the enemy's ranks. 
  Our forces' morale is high. God is Great.

  [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 25 (AFP) -- A night-time calm over 
the city of Aden was shattered early Saturday [25 June] when 
northern troops attacked a suburb, wounding 12 civilians, and a 
southern soldier was killed in fierce frontline fighting. 
  Northern rocket and shell attacks stopped late Friday 
bringing an uneasy calm to the battered city after a day in 
which 14 civilians died and 42 were wounded, hospital officials 
said. 
  But the brief lull in the north's siege ended when the 
northern suburb of Dar-Sa'd, close to the frontline, came under 
attack early Saturday. All 12 casualties came from the 
district, hospital officials said. 
  One soldier was killed and seven others wounded in fighting 
at Bi'r Ahmad, about 15 kilometres (nine miles) northwest of 
Aden, where northern troops loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih were reported to be advancing on Friday. 
  They had taken the school in the middle of Bi'r Ahmad Friday 
after occupying the entrance to the village on Thursday. 
  Southern reinforcements were sent Friday to Bi'r Ahmad to 
try 
to stop the northern advance which threatens to cut off Aden 
from its refinery at Little Aden, 15 kilometres (nine miles) 
away, and the power station at Hiswah, 10 kilometres (six miles) 
away. 
  A southern military spokesman said in Aden late Friday that 
the north "was continuing its desperate attempt to advance on 
Aden," adding they had "suffered hundreds of dead and wounded 
and lost 12 assault tanks." 
  UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali blamed the north on 
Friday for the bombing of Aden and called on Sanaa leaders to 
declare an immediate ceasefire. 
  Southern leaders have said that 376 civilians have been 
killed in Aden and the surrounding area since June 11 and 861 
wounded, in a toll obtained Friday by AFP. 
  Fighting between Salih's men and those loyal to his southern 
rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid broke out on May 5, ending a four year 
uneasy union between the former tribal, conservative North Yemen 
and the Marxist South.

  [Text] Aden, 25 Jun (KUNA) -- The southern Yemeni air 
defenses downed a northern Yemeni plane above the Shaykh 'Uthman 
area in the outskirts of Aden at midday today after its attempt 
to raid the area. 
  A KUNA correspondent in Aden saw the northern Yemeni MiG-21 
aircraft burning in flight over the central prison in the Shaykh 
'Uthman area. However, an official communique issued by the

  [Text] Nabil Sha'th says that although the Palestinians 
have always emphasized their conviction that Jerusalem is the 
capital of the Palestinian state, the Jerusalem issue will be 
discussed only at the permanent status negotiations. In this, 
he was reacting to the Fatah-Tunis announcement that its 
autonomy elections campaign will focus on the struggle to 
preserve East Jerusalem's Arab character. 
  Minister Yosi Sarid noted that Jerusalem is not included in 
the autonomy and, as agreed, the discussions on its status will 
be conducted only during the permanent status talks. 
  Minister Sarid, Major General Dani Rothschild, and Nabil 
Sha'th met this morning at the joint command near the Erez 
checkpoint. Our correspondent Moti Amir adds that Minister 
Nabil Sha'th is now in a meeting with Maj. Gen. Dani Rothschild. 
The meeting marks the start of the negotiations on the second 
stage of the autonomy agreements. 
  As for Yasir 'Arafat's visit to the self-rule territory, 
Nabil Sha'th said the visit will take place after the 
Palestinian Authority imposes its control on all spheres of 
life. Minister Sarid added that the date of the visit will 
apparently be coordinated at the Rabin-Peres-'Arafat meeting in 
Paris.

<F P=106> [Report by Pinhas 'Inbari] </F>
  [Text] Jordan and Israel have agreed to open three joint 
border crossings: one between Elat and al-'Aqabah; one in the 
'Arava, linking southern Jordan and Beersheba; and one in the 
Bet She'an area, linking Irbid and Tiberias. 
  Foreign diplomatic sources in Israel told our correspondent 
that an agreement in principle was reached in a recent meeting 
King Husayn held with Prime Minister Rabin and Foreign Minister 
Peres in Elat. 
  Jordan expressed its wish to set up direct links with Israel 
without the Palestinians, and the opening of these border 
crossings is an expression of that policy. Israeli sources said 
agreement has so far been reached only on the opening of the 
crossing between Elat and al-'Aqabah, and that while the other 
crossings are on the agenda, they have still not come up in 
actual talks.

Arab League's delegate at the United Nations, in New York, by 
Ashraf 'Abd-al-'Aziz, in Cairo; date not given; from the 
"Dialogue From Afar" program -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] ['Abd-al-'Aziz] In front of me 
is a statement by Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 
'Abd-al-Majid saying that the League has exhausted its efforts 
to resolve the Yemeni crisis and end the current fighting 
between the Yemeni people. He also said the Yemeni crisis has 
been internationalized by the Security Council's intervention. 
Should we consider this to be a real failure by the Arab League 
to intervene in the crisis? 
  [Abu-al-Nasr] I do not want to say the situation is a 
failure 
or success, because the efforts are continuing. The Arab League 
and the United Nations have tried. This does not mean the two 
organizations have failed to achieve a cease-fire or that the 
door has been closed to future attempts by the Arab league or 
the United Nations. These efforts are continuing and 
cooperation with the Arab League is also continuing. There are 
constant consultations between the UN and Arab League 
secretaries general to reach a solution. I do not want to get 
into the issue of internationalizing the problem because what 
concerns us now is stopping this tragedy and the Yemeni people's 
suffering. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Should we expect a new intervention by the 
Arab League? 
  [Abu-al-Nasr] If the two parties agree. The issue is now 
being raised at the Security Council and undoubtedly the Arab 
League will cooperate with the Council to urge the parties to 
comply with the resolutions passed in this regard. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Nabil Sha'th by Umberto De Giovannangeli; </F>
place and date not given: "The PLO Can Govern, We Are No longer 
Stone Throwers" -- first paragraph is L'UNITA introduction] 
  [Text] "Now we must demonstrate that we are not just 
stonethrowers." This is how our interview with Nabil Sha'th 
began. He is the man who eased relations with Israel, the 
untiring negotiator of the Gaza and Jericho autonomy, and now 
the first PLO minister to install himself in the Gaza Strip, 
with a task about which he himself has strong reservations: 
laying the foundations upon which to construct "our path toward 
liberty." 
  [De Giovannangeli] From Cairo to Gaza: What balance can be 
drawn, on a human and political level, of this "return home?" 
  [Sha'th] I could begin by listing the thousands of problems 
I 
must deal with each day, the most varied requests I must deal 
with. But this statement, however true it may be, does not take 
account of the heart, of the most intimate of sentiments. In 
fact, no difficulty may overshadow the happiness felt in 
returning as a free man to Palestine, the land of my ancestors: 
No exile, even the most "gilded" one, can be worth the land one 
has always dreamt of living in, the land one has always fought 
for. Today Gaza is beginning to breathe in an air of liberty, 
and this is the starting point upon which to reconstruct. 
  [De Giovannangeli] Is the air of liberty that you refer to 
also being "breathed" in Jericho? 
  [Sha'th] The issue is much more complex for the West Bank, 
and in many ways worrying. We run the risk of living in 
"provisional liberty" subjected to intolerable controls and 
restrictions. Jericho cannot become a ghetto, surrounded by the 
Israeli Army, and isolated from the rest of the West Bank. We 
will discuss this situation over the coming days with the 
Israeli negotiators. We must immediately face the 26 issues 
that have remained unresolved: from delimiting the autonomous 
region of Jericho to completing the liberation of the 
Palestinian prisoners, and extending the autonomy to the rest of 
the occupied territories. Not taking sides could seriously 
damage the peace process. Due to the Israeli attitude, we are 
two months behind on the second phase of the negotiations. On 
the other hand, the date of the Israeli withdrawal from all the 
Palestinian territories has nothing to do with the successful 
implementation of the accord on autonomy, but forms an integral 
part of the accord itself, nine months after the signing. Of 
course, we cannot wait five years to see if the accord works. 
  [De Giovannangeli] You refer to "provisional liberty": Is 
this a critical observation made only with regard to Israel? 
  [Sha'th] No, unfortunately it is a more general statement 
that also has to do with the responsibility of the international 
community. What we have been asking for, especially to the 
West, ever since the day after the signing of the Washington 
accords, has been real solidarity. That is, an opportunity to 
be able to demonstrate to the two million Palestinians living in 
the territories that peace is not just a signature but a 
substantial improvement in material living conditions, new 
employment opportunities, health care, education. 
  [De Giovannangeli] And instead? 
  [Sha'th] Instead we found ourselves in front of an amazing 
series of conditions placed by the West and by international 
organizations. Not only is the aid that was foreseen taking a 
long time to materialize, but it is also tied down to requests 
for guarantees that are unyielding to the point that they 
disguise a mistrust in our capability and willingness to use 
this aid for public needs. We are ready for any checks, but we 
must first be placed in a condition to work. 
  [De Giovannangeli] What aid are the territories currently 
most in need of? 
  [Sha'th] I would definitely say financial aid to make the 
Palestinian police work at full capacity and to start with the 
construction of basic infrastructures -- roads, the sewage 
network, health centers -- in Gaza and primarily in the refugee 
camps in the Gaza Strip. It may seem "unpoetical," but at this 
moment peace for the Palestinians "means" livable homes, street 
lights, hospitals with equipment, and factories. To put it in 
one word, a "respectable" life. Because oppression does not 
just mean an Israeli soldier. 
  [De Giovannangeli] What is the most demanding challenge 
facing the Palestinian leadership today? 
  [Sha'th] Working in a kind of "cultural revolution" 
mentality. We must transform the PLO from a liberation movement 
to the embryo of a new class of leaders that are capable of 
building an independent and really autonomous state and not only 
of opposing military occupation. This gamble invests each one 
of us. 
  [De Giovannangeli] In your opinion how should the 
fundamental 
character of the future Palestinian state be? 
  [Sha'th] It must be a democratic and pluralist state on a 
political and economic level as well as on a cultural and 
religious one. In this regard, however, we are not starting 
from scratch: The history of the Palestinian people, of the PLO 
itself, has been a history of cohabitation between Muslims and 
Christians, Marxists and Liberals. We must view the diversities 
existing within us as a precious common wealth, to be exploited 
to the utmost, starting with the institutions. I know well that 
this model of a state is an anomaly in the panorama of the Arab 
world, and the hostility with which certain regimes have looked 
at the accords with Israel also arises from an awareness that 
the Palestinian experience may become an "embarrassing" example 
for everyone. But this does not worry us, instead it fills us 
with pride. 
  [De Giovannangeli] How do you judge the willingness 
demonstrated by Rabin in welcoming the "pilgrim" 'Arafat in 
Jerusalem? 
  [Sha'th] It is undoubtedly a step forward if compared to the 
absurd events of former weeks. One thing is certain: 'Arafat 
will go to pray in the al-Aqsa mosque, and this day is near. 
Let me add that both Rabin and Peres know very well that 
discussions on the final status of Jerusalem have simply been 
postponed and that our objective remains that of making the 
"Holy City" the capital of the two states.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with PLO "Foreign Minister" Faruq </F>
Qaddumi by RESALAT correspondent Jamileh Kadivar in Cairo "on 
the sidelines of the Nonaligned Movement session"; date not 
given] 
  [Excerpts] [Kadivar] What is your opinion of the Gaza- 
Jericho accord and the plan for an autonomous Palestine? 
  [Qaddumi] I had certain views and recommendations regarding 
the peace talks that began in Oslo. I presented my views at the 
Palestinian leadership session. As you are aware I have never 
attended the talks since the accord in Oslo. As I mentioned 
before, I had many recommendations and much criticism with 
regard to this accord. 
  [Kadivar] Do you believe that the establishment of an 
autonomous government in Gaza-Jericho will have positive results 
for the Palestinians? In any case what specifically were your 
recommendations and criticisms regarding the Oslo talks? 
  [Qaddumi] First of all, right from the outset, these talks 
and the accord were not based on the formula of land for peace. 
We had agreed with our brothers in Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon 
that we would support a solution based on that formula, However 
the accord did not pay much attention or lay much stress on this 
accord. In addition, there are no guarantees in this accord. 
The United States and Russia should have guaranteed its 
implementation. They merely contented themselves by 
participating as witnesses. 
  In addition, there should have been some debate on the basic 
issues, and a timeframe should have been discussed for these 
issues. In the accord, most of the clauses are formulated in a 
complex manner that demands further discussion so that the 
implications are clear. The Zionists have used this device to 
impose an interpretation of the clauses that accords with their 
own wishes. That is why the talks are not achieving any clear 
cut results. 
  [Kadivar] Recently 'Arafat had said that it is possible that 
peace with Israel may be temporary. He mentioned this in South 
Africa, and again some days ago. What is your opinion in this 
regard? Why is 'Arafat repeating this stance? 
  [Qaddumi] The accord has some bases and principles that will 
be specified in future talks. When the first and second accords 
were signed in Cairo, the Israelis interpreted many of the 
clauses as they wanted to, and the United States and Russia made 
no effort to paraphrase and clarify them correctly. 
  As you know, this accord is for an interim period of two 
years, but this does not mean that it is free of discrepancies 
and difficulties. 
  [Kadivar] I have read the accord very carefully, but I have 
not been able to comprehend precisely the limits of the powers 
and obligations of the "Palestinian authority" or "the 
autonomous government." Could you please explain the extent and 
manner of these powers? How do you define relations between 
Israel and Palestine? Do you have any historical examples of 
such autonomy? 
  [Qaddumi] No! This has no precedent in history and is a 
unique and exceptional phenomenon among international accords. 
It is the responsibility of the Palestinian nation to create new 
realities in the Palestinian homeland and to be able to 
interpret the accord in a way that will enable it to attain its 
national objectives. All of us believe that the Palestinian 
people will eventually be victorious in this protracted struggle. 
  [Kadivar] What views do the Palestinian people, the 
residents of the occupied areas, have regarding the accord? 
  [Qaddumi] At the outset, the people were in favor of it 100 
percent, but today the number of its proponents has decreased. 
The number decreased to 70 percent and now stands at 30 
percent. This is due to Israel's behavior and its delay in 
withdrawing from Gaza and Jericho. The Israelis do not adhere 
to their commitments. The withdrawal has been delayed five 
months. They renege on their words and promises as they wish, 
as they are the ones who committed usurpation of the Palestinian 
territories in the first place. The international climate and 
situation is such that there is still no international pressure 
on Israel to honor its commitments. [passage omitted] 
  [Kadivar] Until the accord was signed, there were numerous 
differences between the two sides, such as the manner of using 
roads, borders and so on. Have these issues been resolved? 
  [Qaddumi] There are certain peripheral issues that need to 
be clarified, but they are not very momentous. As for the 
highways, the Israelis have control over them and consider them 
to be necessary for Israel's national security. They wish to 
impose their own will and determination, even though the 
highways are part of the national security of the autonomous 
region, not just part of Israel's national or foreign security. 
  It is thus clear that Israel is continuing to contemplate 
aggression and expansion. On the other hand, by raising such 
issues it wishes to extort the maximum concessions from the 
Palestinians or at least from the negotiating team. 
  [Kadivar] What is the status of 'Arafat's cabinet? 
  [Qaddumi] 'Arafat did offer cabinet positions to some 
people, but they refused. The Palestinian Government as an 
institution that can carry out all the administrative duties and 
foreign relations does not exist in this setup. The accord says 
that the PLO acts on its behalf in foreign relations. Therefore 
I am outside the sphere of the administration; since I am only 
in charge of the embassies, foreign and international relations, 
I am not part of the administration. The PLO is the actual 
political and legislative authority in the administration. This 
means that the PLO Central Committee is the central government 
and the government is a domestic body having no foreign 
relations functions. 
  [Kadivar] When will 'Arafat go to Gaza and Jericho? 
  [Qaddumi] I think it will be in a few days. 
  [Kadivar] Can you draw an analogy between the Camp David 
Accords and the Gaza-Jericho Accord? 
  [Qaddumi] They are similar in many respects and many of the 
clauses are similar too. 
  [Kadivar] What are the differences? 
  [Qaddumi] There are not many differences except for the fact 
that the Camp David Accords were signed by the Egyptians and the 
Gaza-Jericho accord by the Palestinians. 
  [Kadivar] Then, when the Camp David Accords were signed, why 
did 'Arafat condemn them and describe them as a form of 
treachery and slavery? Do you not think that the Camp David 
Accords brought greater benefits to the Palestinians than the 
Gaza-Jericho accord? 
  [Qaddumi] The fact is that both the accords were 
unfavorable, but as I said earlier, this was the choice of the 
Palestinians. We merely chose the lesser evil, and that was 
also because we were forced to. In fact, this accord is a 
reality imposed by the larger countries; it imposes certain 
international conditions on us. 
  After the dismantling of the Soviet Union and the end to the 
Cold War and due to certain conditions in the Arab and Islamic 
countries, which are in a relatively weak position, and the fact 
that one power has imposed its will all over the world--all 
these are characteristics of our contemporary era--we cannot 
easily say that we could have gained much more than we have now. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Kadivar] In your opinion, how true is it that the accord 
was signed hastily due to the apprehension on both the Israeli 
and Palestinian sides about the proliferation of Islamism? 
  [Qaddumi] I wish to mention something. The opinion of our 
Iranian friends is of immense importance. You may ask any 
question you like and repeat the answers verbatim. 
  [Kadivar] This is exactly what will be done. I am seeking 
facts about the Palestinian issue and the Gaza-Jericho accord. 
I remember two years ago at the Nonaligned Movement summit in 
Jakarta, I strove to speak to 'Arafat about Palestinian issues. 
Unfortunately, for no particular reason, he avoided speaking to 
me, despite having promised to talk to me. Therefore I am 
grateful that you have spared me some of your time. 
  [Qaddumi] 'Arafat is a religious person who has no fear of 
Islamist leanings. Throughout the course of his life--I am one 
of those who has been with him for nearly 40 years--he has not 
had any close cooperation with the Muslim Brotherhood or with 
any irreligious movements, but he does not fear Islamist 
leanings. However, for certain specific reasons, he has 
differences with them. As for Rabin, why does he fear Islamist 
leanings? 
  There is no doubt that the Islamist movement is part of the 
national and popular movement. I myself am one of those who 
believe that this popular movement can and has the right to 
struggle. We are all facing a common enemy. The only 
differences are in the tactics and mode of tackling them. 
  The fact is that our people, our cultural and historic 
legacy 
is Islamic. Our roots and foundations are Islamic. However, 
due to the evolving factors and developments in the world there 
are differences in perceptions of issues. 'Arafat certainly 
does not fear Islamism. [passage omitted] 
  It is Rabin who fears Islamist tendencies. He is afraid of 
Iran, too, since he knows very well that Iran has Islamic 
thinking and ideology and that Israel is a Zionist and usurper 
country that has occupied "the holy land." He knows that the 
Iranian policy and strategy is opposed to Israel, and we have 
supported the Islamic Revolution right from its outset. In 
Paris, I met imam Khomeyni and we had contacts with many Islamic 
combatants prior to the victory of the Islamic Revolution. 
'Arafat is truly Islamist in his thinking and way of life. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Kadivar] Why is it, then, that from time to time 'Arafat 
criticizes the proliferation of Islamism and the impact of 
Iran's role on the Islamic movements or at least complains about 
them? It is natural for Israel to say these things, but why Abu 
Ammar? [Yasir 'Arafat] 
  [Qaddumi] Abu 'Ammar wants the Islamist movement to be in 
contact with him and cooperate with him. Therefore the Islamist 
groups are in touch with him and cooperate with him within the 
PLO framework. There are many Islamist personalities who are in 
touch with 'Arafat. The problem only begins when some groups 
listen to the words of other Arab or non-Arab countries. This 
generates differences, which have proliferated in the aftermath 
of the signing of the accord. 
  [Kadivar] What is the outlook for the future of the region 
after peace between Israel and Arab countries? 
  [Qaddumi] It is not easy to talk of complete peace with Arab 
countries. For example, Syria has a clear stance that Israel 
should withdraw from all occupied Syrian and Lebanese 
territories. The Israelis say that they cannot function on two 
fronts simultaneously and that first of all, issues should be 
settled with the Palestinians. As you are aware, there are 
still many differences with the Palestinians with regard to 
withdrawal by Israel. Therefore, Syria will not sign any accord 
with Israel until it withdraws completely from Golan and Lebanon. 
  [Kadivar] While we have witnessed Abu Ammar reneging on his 
stance on talks with the Israelis, do you think Syria will do 
the same? 
  [Qaddumi] I do not think so. I know Hafiz al-Asad and 
Syrian policy very well and I do not believe he will retreat 
from his stance. 
  [Kadivar] As you mentioned, it was due to certain 
international developments that 'Arafat agreed to talks. The 
same conditions existed for Syria as well. Why was it that 
'Arafat succumbed to these conditions and Syria did not? 
  [Qaddumi] No. The circumstances for the PLO were different 
from Syria's. If this little opening had not emerged, the PLO 
would have encountered financial and political crises. In fact, 
the PLO sought refuge in the Gaza-Jericho accord. 
  [Kadivar] How do you appraise relations between Iran and the 
PLO? 
  [Qaddumi] Our relations are in fact friendly and fraternal. 
Our embassy in Tehran is one of our largest embassies. Our 
ambassador in Iran is brother Abu Salah--Salah al-Zawawi--with 
whom I have been well acquainted since our youth. He is a 
dynamic, able, and intelligent person, who, despite various 
differences of opinion, has striven to maintain Iran-PLO 
relations at the desired level. 
  There are many differences and strains that I believe are 
tactical or ephemeral. All of us believe that we have a common 
enemy before us. 
  [Kadivar] What are your expectations of Iran? 
  [Qaddumi] That on the basis of its policy it will continue 
to defend us on the international level. As you see in the 
world today, there is a new system which conflicts with our 
aspirations and mores. 
  We should approach these circumstances in such a manner that 
we can reach our objectives. 
  [Kadivar] I thank you for answering my questions with such 
patience. 
  [Qaddumi] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jamil al-Tarifi, chairman of the Palestinian </F>
Civil Coordination Committee, by Tawfiq 'Abid in Amman; date not 
given] 
  [Excerpts] ['Abid] Palestinian-Israeli contacts are under 
way in preparation for the forthcoming negotiations. Where have 
these contacts reached and what is the agenda of negotiations? 
  [Al-Tarifi] The Cairo agreement is not a detailed agreement. 
There are economic, security, civil, and other committees which 
are following up the implementation of this agreement. 
Palestinian-Israeli contacts and non-negotiating sessions are 
being held, but they all revolve around the appropriate method 
to implement the agreement in the best possible way. 
  According to the Oslo agreement, the phase of negotiations 
on 
early jurisdictions and redeployment of the Israeli Army should 
commence immediately after the signing of the Gaza-Jericho 
accord. This redeployment should be outside the residential 
areas--cities, villages, and camps. 
  Regarding the early negotiations, intensive contacts are 
underway to resume negotiations as soon as possible. I think 
negotiations can begin within two weeks on early jurisdictions, 
which include five areas. These are tourism, social affairs, 
education, health, and direct taxes. However, following the 
Hebron massacre and the Cairo agreement, it has become clear 
that in addition to the five early jurisdictions there should be 
agreement on other jurisdictions. This is what we are are going 
to do within the next few days, God willing. 
  ['Abid] In the light of Hebron incidents, is there a new 
negotiating agenda? 
  [Al-Tarifi] The early jurisdictions were five, in addition 
to 
what the two sides may agree on. However, it emerged after the 
Hebron incidents that there should be more jurisdictions and we 
should agree to the nature of these additional jurisdictions. 
This is what we will negotiate very soon. 
  ['Abid] How do you evaluate the start of the formation of 
the 
Palestinian authority and the performance of the national 
security forces in Gaza and Jericho? 
  [Al-Tarifi] I can say that every Palestinian and Arab takes 
pride in the performance of the Palestinian forces. In spite of 
the shortage of available means, these forces performed 
splendidly and the Palestinian people embraced them right from 
the beginning. We were afraid that the people's zeal over the 
return of the Palestinian security forces would soon abate, but 
now that the Palestinian celebrations marking their return are 
over, the citizens continue to be satisfied with their good 
performance. Our people under the Palestinian authority are 
psychologically comfortable. They are aware of the difference 
between occupation and the new situation. There are no more 
curfews, freedom restrictions, arrests, or storming of houses. 
  ['Abid] Some speak of Israeli violations of the Cairo 
agreement. The latest was made by Dr. Sha'th. What is your 
comment? 
  [Al-Tarifi] The agreement exists and certainly there will be 
some violations from both sides. There are Israeli violations 
and there may be violations on our side. What is important is 
to resolve differences through the coordination committee 
without leaving any traces on which any future misunderstanding 
might be built and eventually affect the agreement. 
  ['Abid] What about the Jericho crossing point? The 
agreement was signed more than one and a half months ago, but 
the situation at the crossing points is still the same. 
  [Al-Tarifi] It is known that independent Palestinian offices 
with a Palestinian flag will be established at the Jericho and 
Rafah crossing points. These offices will house a director, an 
administrative and security deputy, and Palestinian policemen. 
There will also be Israeli offices. I believe the relevant 
arrangements will be finalized within a week or 10 days at most, 
after which Palestinian policemen will arrive at the Rafah 
crossing point. As for the King Husayn Bridge, the arrangements 
will be discussed during a meeting between President 'Arafat and 
Yitzhaq Rabin in the near future. 
  ['Abid] Why do you think President 'Arafat's arrival in the 
self-rule area has been postponed? 
  [Al-Tarifi] To begin with, we want the president to arrive 
in this area as soon as possible, so the sooner he arrives the 
better. However, I have this to say: Any Palestinian official 
who tells the media that the president will arrive in one or two 
weeks, and also any Palestinian official arriving in the 
territories claiming that he will prepare for the president's 
arrival is not telling the truth. 'Arafat has never announced 
that he would arrive after a certain period of time or that he 
would postpone such an arrival. 
  As far as I know, President 'Arafat will arrive in the near 
future. We in the territories need his early arrival, and I 
believe that 'Arafat understands the situation well. No doubt, 
arranging the Palestinian people's situation is very important, 
particularly with regard to the institutions, the cadres' entry, 
and the securing of financial aid to the Palestinian forces, 
institutions, and authority. President 'Arafat is working for 
these objectives day and night. 
  ['Abid] You are leaving for Tunis. Are you carrying 
Palestinian or Israeli ideas or messages to the Palestinian 
leadership on the coming negotiations? 
  [Al-Tarifi] I am going to Tunis, and I shall be discussing 
many issues with President 'Arafat. In fact, we are in daily 
contact with 'Arafat to brief him on the situation in the 
territories. However, some issues are difficult to discuss on 
the telephone, so they should be discussed face to face. These 
issues are related to the coming negotiations, specifically the 
early jurisdictions, the overall situation in the territories, 
and the Palestinian authority. 
  I would like to say that I am not carrying Israeli ideas. As 
head of the Civil Coordination Committee, I meet with Israeli 
officials several times a week to follow up on implementing the 
civil aspects of the Cairo agreement and also on future 
negotiations. However, there is no Israeli concept apart from 
the one expressed as part of both the overall peace process and 
the issues proposed for discussions. 
  ['Abid] Frankly speaking, what is your comment on the recent 
developments in the negotiations on the Jordanian-Israeli track? 
  [Al-Tarifi] In fact, we welcome the Jordanian step, and we 
believe that it complements the Palestinian-Israeli agreement. 
This confirms that we did not sign a separate agreement with 
Israel and that we support completing the peace process on other 
Arab tracks. It was clear, however, that the Palestinian side 
did not let anyone decide its own destiny. The Palestinian 
people have a leadership that coordinates with all Arab parties 
. It is true that the Oslo agreement was not publicized because 
the talks were held in secret, but all Arab parties were fully 
briefed on the Cairo negotiations. I would like to emphasize 
that our relationship with Jordan is an integral one, and that 
we are one people. Consequently, we believe that the Jordanian 
approach is correct, and we hope it will bear fruit soon. 
  As Palestinians, we are interested in joining the Arab ranks 
and we do not want to rush westward. We, however, want to go 
westward along with our brothers in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and 
Egypt after reaching an understanding on agreed issues. 
  ['Abid] What is your comment on the remarks made by His 
Highness Crown Prince Hasan the Regent regarding the 
establishment of a federal state [dawlah ittihadiyah] east of 
Israel on the two banks of the River Jordan? 
  [Al-Tarifi] This is a purely Jordanian matter, into which we 
will not poke our noses. For His Royal Highness Prince Hasan 
has the right to choose the name he likes for his country. The 
name the United Hashemite Kingdom is fine with us if the 
Jordanian people and leadership endorse this. 
  As for us, the successive sessions of the Palestine National 
Council [PNC] have endorsed confederation between the two banks 
of the River Jordan. A confederation is based on two separate 
political entities that complement one another. [passage 
omitted] 
  ['Abid] Some believe that there has been a delay in the 
return of the PLO cadres, particularly civilian cadres, to Gaza 
and Jericho, and that the promises made to the Palestinians have 
not been kept. In your opinion, what is behind all this? 
  [Al-Tarifi] There are attempts to brand the Palestinian 
authority as impotent, to say that it will remain so, and that 
it will fail. Well, we are not sitting at doorsteps, begging 
for aid. Nonetheless, we believe that Arab and foreign countries 
owe us certain rights, particularly since the Palestinian 
debacle is the outcome of Arab and international developments. 
  I believe that some aid has been received. At the recent 
conference held by donor nations, it was agreed to provide the 
self- rule authority with $42 million, with the understanding 
that the aid will be resumed so that Palestinian institutions 
can perform their tasks. The picture is not so bleak or gloomy. 
But, there are many parties that seek to depict us as failures. 
These parties want to say that what has taken place on the 
Palestinian territories has been no more than ceremonial events 
that have come to an end. 
  By the way, I would like to say that the Palestinian 
leadership has concluded a telecommunications agreements with an 
international firm so that we may not remain tied to the Israeli 
telecommunications corporation. A similar agreement has been 
concluded with an international electrical firm to supply the 
Gaza Strip with electric power so that we may not remain hostage 
to the Israelis. 
  A third agreement has been signed with another firm to 
supply 
the Palestinian authority with oil from the international 
market. This firm has obtained a concession, and it will have 
huge storage tanks in Gaza. 
  Additionally, the Palestinian authority has signed two 
tenders for the construction of two airports, one in Gaza and 
the other in Jericho. A contract has also been signed to 
construct a fishing port in Gaza. Another contract has been 
signed to build housing units in the autonomous areas. Within 
the next few weeks, efforts to carry out these tenders, the 
overall cost of which exceeds $1.5 billion, will begin. 
[passage omitted] 
  ['Abid] The Cairo agreement has not thus far been endorsed 
by 
the Palestinian legislative bodies. Have any arrangements been 
made for the holding of a PNC session? 
  [Al-Tarifi] I believe that the PLO Central Council, and not 
the PNC, may hold a session in the territories. Right now, all 
our efforts are focused on entrenching our presence in the 
territories. 
  The Israeli authorities have approved the repatriation of 
most members of the PLO Central Council. So, the PLO Central 
Council may convene in Palestine. And consequently, it could 
debate the agreement.

<F P=106> [Interview with Muhammad al-Nashashibi, Palestinian </F>
Authority "finance minister," by Pascal Lacorie in Jerusalem; 
date not given: "Palestinian Autonomy: `Agreement With Israel 
Utterly Unbalanced'" -- first paragraph is LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES 
introduction] 
  [Text] Muhammad al-Nashashibi is the Palestinian 
Authority's new finance "minister." Based in Jericho, this 
68-year-old banker is preparing to draft his first budget. 
  [Lacorie] How much time do you require to collect taxes for 
the first time? 
  [Al-Nashashibi] Everything should be operational within a 
month at the most. However, we have a huge task ahead of us. 
For instance, I need to find Palestinians to replace the 351 
Israelis who took care of fiscal and financial matters as part 
of the military administration. 
  We also need to recover all computer files pertaining to 
taxes and custom duties currently scattered among various 
Israeli ministries. 
  [Lacorie] Did you receive the $42-million (240 million 
French francs) in emergency aid which the international 
community pledged to grant earlier this month? 
  [Al-Nashashibi] No, we have not received anything so far. 
This is not what matters right now, though. We must first set 
to work, and the money will follow. 
  [Lacorie] Has Yasir 'Arafat postponed his arrival in the 
autonomous territories to protest the fact that this aid package 
has still not materialized? 
  [Al-Nashashibi] President 'Arafat stated that he could not 
come in a bankruptcy context, but there are other reasons as 
well. In any case, the other members of the Palestinian 
Authority will come to Jericho in two weeks; I hope the 
president will do the same. 
  [Lacorie] What do you think of the economic component of the 
agreement entered into with Israel? 
  [Al-Nashashibi] This agreement, which was put together in 
Paris, is utterly unbalanced, and we shall try to renegotiate it 
as soon as possible, as all it does is protect Israeli 
interests. We had to agree to applying the same custom duties 
as Israel does, for the sole purpose of sparing Israeli firms 
any inconvenience. Another example: We shall be able to sell 
oil fuels at a price only 15 percent lower than that in Israel, 
even though we could have purchased oil products at a much 
better price from Arab countries and passed the saving on to our 
population. 
  Obviously, should we fail to make significant amendments to 
the agreement, the Palestinian population will be very 
disappointed and frustrated.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bassam Abu-Sharif, political adviser to PLO </F>
Executive Committee Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, by Riyad Mansur; 
place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Mansur] The date for the arrival of President 
Yasir 'Arafat in Jericho has been postponed several times. What 
are the causes of this postponement? What are the problems he 
is facing? 
  [Abu-Sharif] President Yasir 'Arafat will not enter the 
autonomous areas unless the pledges made by the donor nations, 
the EEC members, and other industrialized nations about 
financing infrastructure, development, and economic growth 
projects in the Palestinian territories are honored. This is 
because President 'Arafat does not want his entry there to be 
merely ceremonial. He wants to go the autonomous areas to 
rebuild the infrastructure, and to launch economic development 
projects there. Consequently, and despite the speculation of 
all, I would like to say that setting a date for his arrival in 
the autonomous areas is contingent upon his trust that the 
required funds, for the initial period at least, have been 
earmarked so that the implementation of projects may start. 
Otherwise, what would be the meaning of his arrival there? We 
are not seeking ceremonies. What we want is to rebuild the 
infrastructure, as well as the economy. Our people in the 
territories want to build their homeland. But, at the same 
time, they also want to work for a better life. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Mansur] The Palestinian police have begun their work by 
arresting some Islamist leaders. Some have said that this will 
result in a confrontation between the police and the people. Do 
you expect this confrontation to continue or subside, given the 
fact that the Palestinian opposition has refused to surrender 
its weapons to the police? 
  [Abu-Sharif] The Palestinian opposition is legal. The 
democratic atmosphere we seek to create in Palestine will grant 
opposition factions the opportunity to express their views 
through the printed and audio/visual media. They will even be 
allowed to stage demonstrations. This is a right guaranteed to 
them. This will create a vibrant society. The opposition is 
the guarantee that the leadership will continue to seek perfect 
decisions. Nonetheless, when the opposition resorts to violence, 
it becomes illegal. The opposition is guaranteed the full right 
to express its views within the context of the freedom of 
expression ensured in a democracy. However, when you use 
violence, you revoke the rights guaranteed you by the democratic 
society. This is because the faction that uses violence 
violates democratic traditions. Consequently, the factions 
engaged in violence will be pursued; and pursuing these factions 
is a right. [passage omitted] 
  [Mansur] President 'Arafat has not thus far completed the 
formation of the Palestinian authority. It has been reported 
that you have rejected an offer by 'Arafat to take the 
information portfolio. Will you tell us why you rejected this 
offer? 
  [Abu-Sharif] I have refused to take any portfolio, or to 
assume any responsible position at this point in time. This 
does not mean that I am abandoning my sacred duty to play any 
role or perform any task that would promote the interests of the 
Palestinian people. For, throughout my lifetime of struggle, I 
have always sought to promote the interests of the Palestinian 
people, and advance the Palestinian cause. 
  As a matter of fact, this issue has something to do with 
personal convictions that I have regarding the prerequisites of 
creating a democracy in Palestine. [passage omitted] 
  [Mansur] In retrospect, we now realize that we cannot 
count on the political and material support of the Americans 
forever. Look at what happened to al-Sadat and Gorbachev. What 
is the PLO betting on? 
  [Abu-Sharif] When it comes to the Arabs, don't look for the 
word support in the American dictionary. The United States has 
its interests to look after. The Arabs should have the 
intelligence to create circumstances that will make their 
interests coincide with those of the United States. Then the 
Arabs will do well and the United States will necessarily 
support the Arabs. Such are the rules that today's world lives 
by. It is up to us to create the conditions for that to happen. 
The United States has strategic interests in the region. These 
translate as oil, markets, and geography. We have only 
ourselves to blame. We should have stood up for our rights. We 
have failed to deal with the United States as an equal. This, 
despite the fact that the United States depends in a big way on 
our oil, resources, markets, and strategic position. 
  There is no such thing as unilateral interests. Interests 
are a two-way street. Those who are taking revenge on Iraq now 
do not know that their vengeance will be revisited upon them. 
Unless the Arabs agree on a modicum of solidarity in order to 
protect their interests in a world ruled by big powers, the Arab 
world will sink. Iraq is a significant player in Arab politics, 
and yet the Iraqi people are being starved and denied medicine, 
without a finger being lifted in their defense. 
  [Mansur] And yet the PLO abandoned Iraq, having supported it 
during the Gulf war. 
  [Abu-Sharif] The PLO had consistently sought a resolution to 
the Iraq-Kuwait issue, and in concert with certain European 
nations strove to avert war and then open the way for a 
political solution. But the PLO's effort proved fruitless, since 
the United States wanted to hurt Iraq, not liberate Kuwait. 
  [Mansur] Iraq has taken a negative attitude toward the Gaza- 
Jericho First accord out of its concern for the territorial 
integrity of Palestine. 
  [Abu-Sharif] Any country is free to criticize the 
Gaza-Jericho First accord. There is room for a diversity of 
opinion on a political settlement. The Palestinians are 
tolerant of criticism on that score. But the Iraq affair is 
more serious that the Gaza-Jericho First issue. The aim is to 
marginalize the role of the Arab nation by targeting its 
military and financial backbone in Iraq so that the United 
States succeed in imposing a settlement on its terms. If the 
Palestinians stomached Gaza-Jericho, that was a case of the 
choice of the lesser evil. 
  [Mansur] It is no secret that the Jordanian-Palestinian 
relationship is not exactly at its best. Amman does not hide 
its dissatisfaction. Why do you think that is? And how do you 
think excellent and solid ties can be forged with Jordan? 
  [Abu-Sharif] Coordination necessarily presupposes talks 
before decisions are made. Coordination cannot be a matter of 
one party informing the other party that an agreement has been 
reached. However, things are not that simple. My idea of 
coordination is for the parties to combine their strengths. 
Neither the PLO, nor Jordan, nor Syria, nor Lebanon, can become 
any stronger unless there is real coordination among themselves 
about the items on the agenda of the negotiations. 
  Coordination is a lever that could promote the interests of 
all sides. The party that fails to effect coordination with the 
other sides will fall into the Israeli trap. For despite its 
peace program, the Israeli Government has set traps. It seeks 
to drive wedges between the Arab sides, because it makes gains 
when it deals with the Arab sides one at a time. I would like 
to say clearly that had there been true, profound, and sincere 
coordination among Palestine, Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon, and 
had these parties obtained the necessary Arab support, we would 
have obtained a better deal than the Cairo agreement signed by 
President Yasir 'Arafat. Nonetheless, I do consider the Cairo 
agreement a historic step regardless of the reservations some 
might have about it. 
  Inter-Arab coordination, particularly coordination between 
the Palestinians and Jordanians, is necessary. We have a 
problem that has preoccupied the minds of all. Nonetheless, 
nobody seems to be speaking about it. Since time immemorial, 
Palestine and Jordan have been one country and one family. How 
then can there be two communities, two families, and two 
countries at present? The solution that would meet all 
requirements of the people in the two banks of the River Jordan 
and Gaza Strip lies in the launching of a single state 
consisting of Gaza, the West Bank, and the East Bank, regardless 
of the form this state might take, be it a confederation or a 
federation. If all parties, particularly those endowed with 
wisdom and vision, do not act on the basis of the fact that this 
community is a single community, and that this people are one 
people and part of a single country, the population of these 
three areas may not be able to confront Israel, which is seeking 
to swallow up the region, but economically this time. 
  [Mansur] How does the PLO view the momentum seen on the 
Jordanian-Israeli track of negotiations, especially with regard 
to the agreement on talks to demarcate borders? 
  [Abu-Sharif] King Husayn is one of the few Arab leaders who 
possess both vision and wisdom. Some Arab rulers might possess 
wisdom, but be lacking in vision; while others might possess 
vision, but be lacking in wisdom. But, King Husayn has both. 
Through his recent political moves, King Husayn has sought to 
put things right, particularly since the peace process is 
progressing. And since the peace process is a reflection of the 
international community's desire to achieve stability in the 
Middle East, Jordan, which has always advocated the attainment 
of a lasting and durable peace in the region, was bound to make 
its own contributions to the peace process to promote it. I am 
well aware that his majesty the king is fully supportive of the 
Palestinian people's right to self- determination. In the same 
vein, I am also aware that his majesty the king has his own 
views regarding the unity of the people in the two banks of the 
River Jordan and Gaza Strip. His majesty the king is well aware 
that this area; namely, the East Bank of the River Jordan, the 
West Bank, and Gaza Strip are capable of becoming a bastion to 
defend the Arab region in the face of expansionism. We believe 
that His Majesty King Husayn is a leader endowed with both 
vision and wisdom. Likewise, we believe that Yasir 'Arafat is 
also a leader endowed with both vision and wisdom. We also 
believe that these two leaders, if they coordinate their 
positions and moves well, can protect the Arab nation and enable 
it to meet future challenges. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "In Statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, </F>
Palestinian Authority Minister Attacks `Erroneous Practices' in 
Gaza and Jericho"] 
  [Excerpts] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- A Palestinian 
Authority minister has attacked the Palestinian leadership's 
working methods and the manner in which it deals with the 
self-rule areas. 'Azmi al-Shu'aybi (from the Fida party) 
criticized the policy of domination and monopolization pursued 
in the entire political, security, economic, and administrative 
structure being set up. He warned against transferring the 
deformities afflicting the PLO and its experiment in exile to 
Palestinian territory, because that would lead to its failure. 
  Dr. al-Shu'aybi, sports and youths minister, said in a 
statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that "we in the Palestinian 
Democratic Union `Fida' decided to participate in the authority 
in order to serve our people in this stage. From the outset we 
have called for abandoning old working methods and the policy of 
domination, not politicizing the institutions, and reducing 
reliance on individuals in favor of institutional action based 
on competence and the real need. Despite our knowledge of the 
chronic ailments in Palestinian action outside the homeland, we 
wagered and continue to wager on the role of popular control 
over the institutions to be moved to the homeland. Because the 
Palestinian people, who have waited all these years and 
succeeded in returning their leadership from abroad, will not 
allow incompetent structures to be imposed on them from abroad." 
[passage omitted] 
  Al-Shu'aybi pointed to the danger of militarizing the 
institutions and to the militias' control of citizens' life and 
food. He said that "the most dangerous thing facing us is the 
lack of clear powers and the separation between security and and 
police services operating in Gaza and Jericho. Our people have 
begun to openly express their indignation at the spread of 
security services and the way in which the preventive security 
service operates. And numerous field commanders still have not 
comprehended the fact that the authority does not belong to 
Fatah and that Gaza and Jericho are not another Lebanon." 
  He added, "we are a responsible and constructive opposition 
using the weapon of criticism, which expresses the people's 
feelings and their discontent at methods which are alien to 
their struggle traditions through which they confronted the 
occupation over the past years. While we criticize erroneous 
practices and participate in the Palestinian Authority, we raise 
our voice to avert mistakes and correct the march immediately. 
We expressed this in front of Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat, whose impartiality we respect and appreciate."

<F P=106> [Report by Muhammad Bishqar from Beirut] </F>
  [Text] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. 
The issue of the Palestinian detainees in the jails of the 
Zionist occupation authorities continues to be the focus of 
public activity in occupied Palestine. A general strike was 
observed today in the West Bank, occupied Jerusalem, and the two 
Palestinian autonomous areas of Gaza and Jericho to show 
solidarity with thousands of Palestinian detainees who reject 
the Zionist conditions for their release. They have been on a 
hunger strike since last week. 
  Today's strike was accompanied by massive demonstrations in 
West Bank towns and refugee camps and sit-ins in front of the 
offices of the International Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC] 
in Gaza and Jericho. The protesters called for the detainees' 
unconditional release and criticized the PLO leadership's method 
of handling the detainee issue. 
  Hundreds of Palestinian detainees in the Zionist jail in 
Nabulus have also assailed the PLO leadership. In a statement 
today, they leveled sharp criticisms at Yasir 'Arafat's 
leadership style which exploits the detainee issue as a 
bargaining chip. The statement affirmed that the detainees will 
persist in refusing to sign declarations of support for the 
peace agreement with the enemy or promise to halt the intifadah 
as a condition for their release. 
  Ahmad Jibril's Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC] distributed a leaflet in the 
West Bank blaming 'Arafat's leadership for the continued 
suffering of thousands of Palestinian detainees in the enemy's 
jails. The PFLP-GC called on the Palestinian people to continue 
their intifadah and express solidarity with the detainees by 
demonstrating and holding sit-ins. 
  The Forces of the Palestinian Alliance that comprise the 10 
factions opposed to the peace agreement with the enemy organized 
a sit-in today for the second day running in front of the ICRC 
office in Damascus to declare solidarity with the detainees. 
The protesters delivered a message to ICRC officials, to be 
forwarded to the United Nations, calling for the prompt and 
unconditional release of all Palestinian prisoners in Israeli 
jails regardless of their political affiliations. 
  Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of the Democratic Front 
for the Liberation of Palestine, declared in the Syrian capital 
today that the Palestinian detainee issue is the focus of a 
fresh popular resurgence inside and outside occupied Palestine. 
Hawatimah emphasized that the Palestinians are confident now 
that the peace agreement between the PLO and the Zionist enemy 
does not serve their interests and cannot survive because of the 
complex problems hindering its implementation, particularly in 
connection with the issues of Jerusalem, the detainees, and 
Palestinian human rights.

working visit to Israel along with a delegation of Gulf 
businessmen. 
  These sources told AL-RA'Y AL-'AMM that what has been 
published recently about a visit by businessmen from the Gulf 
Cooperation Council to Tel Aviv last week may be correct, but 
not a single Kuwaiti businessman participated in this visit. 
  It is noteworthy that the board chairman of the Egyptian 
Airlines Company, ZAS [name as published], has recently stated 
that his company had carried businessmen from the Gulf states to 
Tel Aviv to discuss spheres of cooperation and joint 
opportunities in light of peace prospects in the region.

British president of the Board of Trade, said here today that he 
did not discuss "any new trade deals" for British companies in 
Kuwait as part of a privatization drive.

countries and to present Britain's privatization experience and 
its success so that Kuwait could benefit from it. 
  He expressed his hope that British companies would be given 
more investment opportunities in Kuwait, stressing that the 
final decision belonged to the Kuwaiti Government. [passage

  [Excerpt] Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, June 26 (AFP) -- Saudi 
Foreign Minister Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal met a senior Omani 
official here Sunday [26 June] to discuss the conflict in 
neighbouring Yemen, where northern forces launched a new 
intensive bombardment of the southern stronghold of Aden. 
  Omani Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Yusuf Bin-'Alawi 
'Abdallah paid a brief visit to Jeddah and held talks with 
Prince Sa'ud, Arab diplomats said, only a day after a senior 
northern Yemeni envoy had visited Oman. 
  Meanwhile fighting raged in the suburbs of Aden, following 
the collapse of the fifth ceasefire to be announced in the 
two-month-old civil war. 
  Oman and Saudi Arabia played a key role in securing the 
adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 924 of June 1, which 
called for an immediate ceasefire. Oman currently chairs the 
Security Council. 
  On Saturday 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, a member of the 
northern Yemeni presidential council, handed a message to Sultan 
Qabus of Oman from Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. 
  The northern Yemeni authorities blamed the south for 
violating the latest ceasefire, declared by Sanaa late Saturday. 
It was set for midnight (2100 GMT). 
  "The (southern) rebel outlaws violated the ceasefire and 
continued their aggression against our armed forces in the Aden 
and Hadhramawt provinces," a northern spokesman said. 
  The northern Yemeni cabinet held a special meeting Sunday to 
discuss the ceasefire, Sanaa radio said, but ministers learned 
of the renewed fighting during the meeting. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Jeddah, June 27, SPA -- The second deputy premier, 
minister of defense, aviation and inspector general, Prince 
Sultan Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz presided over the weekly regular 
session of the Council of Ministers at al-Salam palace in Jeddah 
this afternoon. 
  In a statement to Saudi Press Agency, Information Minister 
'Ali al-Sha'ir said Prince Sultan, at the outset of the meeting, 
had briefed the cabinet on the latest Arab and international 
events and reports related to the Yemeni arena. 
  Prince Sultan highlighted also the great role that had been 
undertaken by Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Fahd 
Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz to end the fighting and save the blood of the 
innocent Yemeni brothers. 
  "King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, may the Almighty God preserve 
him, is making continuous efforts on Arab and international 
levels for a decisive and firm ceasefire in Yemen," Prince 
Sultan informed the cabinet. 
  Al-Sha'ir said Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal, the foreign minister 
presented a detailed report on the outcome of his recent tour to 
a number of Arab and western countries during the last few days 
and contents of messages he had sent to a number of Arab foreign 
ministers and the outcome of his talks with them. Prince Sa'ud 
also briefed the cabinet on his impressions of the tour. Prince 
Sa'ud said the wise directives of custodian of the two holy 
mosques King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz at the current critical 
circumstances facing the region, necessitate continuous efforts, 
meetings and consultations to be directed with the aim of 
dedication of peace and stability in the region. 
  Al-Sha'ir said the cabinet also reviewed the latest reports 
carried by the media on the deteriorating situation in Somalia, 
Afghanistan and Bosnia. Referring to Somalia, the cabinet 
expressed regret over the latest and sharp escalations in 
fighting in Mogadishu between the conflicting factions for the 
third day running that led to a big number of casualties and the 
loss of lives. It also expressed concern on the sudden 
escalations in air bombardment operations in the western Afghan 
city of Herat. 
  The cabinet also followed the latest developments in the 
Bosnian arena and the efforts being made by commander of the 
Bosnian Army to defend the lives, territories and honour of the 
Bosnian people on all fronts vis-a-vis the unannounced Serbian 
attacks. 
  In this context, al-Sha'ir said, the Saudi Council of 
Ministers appealed to the conflicting parties throughout Arab 
and Islamic worlds to put weapons aside, seek rational and 
amicable solutions for disputes bearing in mind that conflicts 
between brothers would serve no one except their enemies and 
will never be in the best interests of the Arab and Islamic 
nations. 
  "The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is always looking forward for 
establishment of peace and justice all over the world," 
al-Sha'ir noted. 
  Meanwhile, the cabinet reviewed a number of domestic items 
on 
its agenda and Prince Sultan listened to views and suggestions 
made by the concerned ministers on them. It also opted for the 
necessary procedures on them. 
  The cabinet agreed on the renewal of the commercial and 
economic agreement between the Government of the Kingdom of 
Saudi Arabia and the Lebanese Republic which was concluded in 
1391 AH [27 February 1971] for one more year effective from 
26-1-1415 [5 July 1994]. 
  It endorsed the closing account of the department of 
retirement and pensions for the fiscal year 1411/1412 AH [24 
July 1990 to 13 July 1991] and approved some appointments at 
Grade 14th.

<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Yahya al-Mutawakkil by </F>
Shakir al-Jawhari in Sanaa; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Al-Jawhari] Mr. Minister, I would like to start 
this interview by asking you to explain a phenomenon that I do 
not understand. How did you manage to control the security 
situation during war times better than during peace when many 
Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leaders were targets for 
assassinations, which was one of the reasons for the current 
crisis in Yemen? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] We thank God that the security situation 
fares well in spite of the existence of a conspiracy to 
undermine and sabotage institutions. We have unraveled many 
chapters of this conspiracy. In spite of this conspiracy, one 
can note that the security situation is satisfactory, and I hope 
this will remain so for a long time. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Jawhari] Can you give us examples of the sabotage 
operations that citizens have been tasked to carry out and which 
they have revealed to you, as well as who tasked them to do so? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] We have discovered many sabotage operations, 
including plans to blow up the television station building, and 
many bridges on public routes, power plants, and oil pumps. 
  Some of the operations were carried out. However, thanks to 
God, they were unsuccessful. A device was detonated on the oil 
pipeline from Ma'rib to al-Sarif [name as transliterated] Port 
near al-Hudaydah. But, the citizens quickly repaired the 
damage. The perpetrators were identified and we arrested some 
of their relatives. We now are looking for the perpetrators 
with the help of their relatives. 
  [Al-Jawhari] To which side do those involved in the sabotage 
operations that were discovered before they were implemented 
belong? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] Most of them are mercenaries who are ready 
to 
work for the party that pays them. Some confessed that the YSP 
paid them money, while others said they were YSP members. 
  Their arrest has also revealed to us that some of them 
collaborated with leading figures within the YSP in carrying out 
the assassination attempts against the party's leaders. We will 
try these elements at the appropriate time. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Jawhari] House of Representatives Speaker Shaykh 
'Abdallah al-Ahmar said that Tariq al-Fadli was set free. How 
can he and others be released without trial? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] I would like to clarify here that those who 
were detained in Aden and Lahij were released in view of the 
present battle because the prison doors were open. They came 
out and some of them are fighting. 
  [Al-Jawhari] Fighting with whom? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] Some are fighting with the forces of 
legitimacy and others against it. Tariq al-Fadli is the only 
one to be released on bail because the public prosecutor, as 
yet, has not indicted him. Therefore, and in view of the 
extraordinary circumstances, he was released on bail on 
condition that he appear before the court as soon as conditions 
enabling the court to convene are made available. 
  [Al-Jawhari] Who put up the bail for him? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] One of the shaykhs of the al-Fadli clan. 
  [Al-Jawhari] And who ordered his release? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] The public prosecutor. No one objected to 
this decision. We did not object because we are passing through 
extraordinary circumstances. While he was under arrest, he used 
to ask that he be tried. Aden used to ask that he be tried in 
Aden, while we believe he should be tried in Sanaa. He insisted 
on being tried because he said he was innocent. He gave himself 
up because he was certain of his innocence. When the war broke 
out, several shaykhs pledged that he would present himself to 
court when asked to do so. The public prosecution agreed to 
this and we did not object. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Jawhari] Has his interrogation disclosed that he is a 
member of the Jihad group? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] I am not sure of this but the information we 
have indicates that he is. 
  [Al-Jawhari] And did he fight in Afghanistan? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] I am not sure of this, as he was arrested 
before I took office. 
  [Al-Jawhari] According to the information you have as 
interior minister, is there any relationship between the Jihad 
group and any other group in the country? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] The prevalence of democracy following unity 
has enabled political parties to work in a healthy atmosphere. 
The Islamic parties were among the parties that exercised their 
political role with complete freedom, and emerged in the Yemeni 
arena as an influential, positive, and constructive force that 
rejects terrorism. From this premise, any Islamic grouping, 
whatever the name it assumes, if it does not apply for a 
license, will be considered illegal if it carries out any 
activity. This is because it will be viewed as an unlicensed 
party. 
  [Al-Jawhari] Has the Jihad organization applied for a 
license? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] No, and I think it is not qualified to be a 
party. 
  [Al-Jawhari] Why? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] Because it consists of very small groups. 
There are two major Islamic parties, the Yemeni Reform Grouping 
and the al-Maqarr Party [name as published]. These two parties 
represent all the politically active members of the religious 
community. 
  The elements of the Jihad are very few and cannot form a 
party or attract anybody. Their work is mostly guided. 
  [Al-Jawhari] You have said that the Jihad organization is 
not qualified to be a party. Do you mean that it is not 
qualified because of reasons that have to do with it or because 
of objective reasons related to the Parties Law? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] Reasons related to the party itself because 
any party should have a minimum of 1,500 members, as I recall, 
before it can operate. 
  [Al-Jawhari] What if the Jihad organization presents a list 
including the required number of members, will you give them a 
license as a party? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] If they abide by the rules of the political 
game and the laws and regulations and have enough members then 
why not? 
  [Al-Jawhari] Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar says some members of 
the Jihad are now fighting alongside the Socialist Party. Does 
your information confirm this? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] As far as I know, some of the people who 
were imprisoned by the party because they were members of the 
Jihad are now out. Some of them are now fighting alongside the 
party. I think those people were employed by elements within 
the party to play a certain role. 
  [Al-Jawhari] Perhaps they are fighting because they are 
biased toward the south? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] Some of the armed forces fighting with the 
legitimacy are one hundred percent composed of southern 
elements, including commanders and troops, and also the 
al-Wahdah brigades in al-'Anad. 
  [Al-Jawhari] If the Jihad organization is illegal and some 
of its elements have carried out terrorist operations and 
assassinations, are all its members wanted by the security men 
or is this confined to those who are involved in disrupting 
security? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] From a legal point of view, we can only 
demand the elements that have carried out acts of sabotage. 
  [Al-Jawhari] But the law does not permit the existence of 
illegal parties. 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] So far we have been dealing with the name 
"Jihad" as an assumption because this name has not been 
announced yet. The name was mentioned only in the confessions 
of some defendants who said they belong to this organization. 
We do not have sufficient evidence and documents that prove 
such an organization exists. 
  [Al-Jawhari] President Mubarak said last November that some 
elements in Yemen are involved in the terrorist incidents in 
Egypt. President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih told me then that you have 
explained your point of view to Egypt. I assume there have been 
contacts since then and that Egypt was not convinced of your 
view, considering its current attitude. What took place in 
these contacts? Have they given you documented information? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] We have received Egyptian security men. We 
have spoken to them and made it possible for them to see for 
themselves that these charges are baseless. 
  When the president visited Egypt, I was with him. I met with 
the Egyptian interior minister and we agreed to conclude an 
agreement for security cooperation between the two countries to 
prevent terrorism in Yemen and Egypt. Regrettably, however, the 
agreement was not concluded because we were waiting for a 
representative of the Egyptian interior minister to come to 
Sanaa before we sign the agreement so that we can cooperate in 
explaining the situation. They will either tell us what we don't 
know about plots, camps, and elements, or we will explain the 
opposite to them. 
  The representative did not show up and things developed the 
way they are today. The time is not appropriate now to go to 
Egypt and talk about signing the agreement. 
  Whether this has any reflection on Egypt's attitude toward 
unity, we still hope that Egypt will preserve its historic role 
in Yemen and sacrifices by siding with the people who adhere to 
their unity. I would like to say that despite all the biased 
statements, we have heard from President Mubarak -- during the 
visits of Planning Minister al-Iryani, the foreign minister, and 
'Abd-al-Ghani, member of the Presidential Council -- 
reassurances that Egypt will side with unity despite the lack of 
understanding of our stand toward the claims that we want to 
impose unity by force. Unity was the result of popular 
referendum and was bolstered through democratic elections. What 
is happening now is an attempt to impose secession by force. 
  So far, they have not understood this, but attempts are 
still 
under way. We hope Egypt will continue to play a constructive 
role to end the bloodshed and reach a common solution and 
resolve differences with our neighbors who are concerned with 
the current problem one way or another. 
  [Al-Jawhari] What did the Egyptian security officers who 
came to Sanaa achieve? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] The information, which they had obtained 
from 
persons here regarding the existence of terrorist training 
camps, is untrue and unfounded. We sent these officers to the 
places that they said contained these camps, but they found 
nothing. They also made sure that the phone numbers they had 
were not used in the country. 
  [Al-Jawhari] Jordanian newspapers said that some of those 
who 
were arrested for involvement in bombing operations in Jordan 
early this year admitted that they had come to Yemen for 
training and that Shaykh 'Abd-al-Mahjid al-Zindani, 
representative of the Yemeni Reform Grouping in the Presidential 
Council, received them, sent them to training camps, and gave 
them money before they returned to Jordan. Did Jordan inform 
you of this? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] Never. It has not informed us of such a 
matter at all. Our relations and ties with Jordan are so close 
that Jordan would have informed us of that, if it had taken 
place and we would have taken measures to clarify matters, but 
we were not informed of anything. 
  [Al-Jawhari] To my knowledge, Jordan informed you of the 
ambush to which a Jordan patrol was exposed in the township of 
al-Karamah late last year--an ambush during which two Yemenis 
were killed along with a third Jordanian citizen. 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] This is true. Yemenis exist everywhere. We 
also do not deny there were Yemenis in Afghanistan and that 
Bin-Ladin recruited them to carry out terrorist operations in 
many places, including the recent bombings in Jordan. We are 
with the Jordanian Government and with any other government 
cooperating to confront terrorism, whether the terrorists are 
Yemenis or not. 
  [Al-Jawhari] Did Bin-Ladin try to restore his Yemeni 
nationality after his Saudi citizenship was withdrawn? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] He did not try. Maybe he is in the 
Democratic Republic of Yemen, to which some sultans, like 
Bin-Salimah and others, have returned. Why shouldn't he too 
return to it? 
  [Al-Jawhari] How many members of the YSP and the opposition 
parties have you arrested on the sidelines of the current war? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] I prefer that you pose this question to the 
YSP and other parties. 
  [Al-Jawhari] In fact, I telephoned all my friends in these 
parties and found them free, but I do not know the members of 
all these parties. 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] I assure you that we have not arrested 
anyone 
because of his political affiliation, especially the YSP members 
who declared their support for unity and who have helped us 
confront the secession and reply to the forces of apostasy and 
rebellion. 
  But we have discovered warehoused weapons and espionage 
equipment inside Sanaa, including communications equipment, in 
the possession of elements of the YSP security, which was called 
the revolution's security. These weapons and equipment were 
found in public warehouses and places. They were confiscated 
and the perpetrators were arrested for questioning. Those who 
were not tasked with any duties except warehousing were released. 
  [Al-Jawhari] What were the duties of the others? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] Some elements from the north and the south 
were tasked with carrying out terrorist operations in all the 
northern governorates, particularly in Sanaa, as soon as the 
dispute erupted. We stormed these weapons warehouses to arrest 
the perpetrators, many of whom managed to escape. Some of them, 
however, returned and said that they were ordered by the YSP 
leadership to carry out such operations and that they were ready 
to cooperate with the security forces. They are actually 
cooperating with us to obtain new information. 
  [Al-Jawhari] How many YSP members are now in prison? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] I assure you there are no YSP members in 
prison. However, there are elements who do not belong to the 
YSP but were ordered to carry out bombing operations. When we 
questioned them, we discovered they were just mercenaries. 
  There are other people who possessed weapons belonging to 
the 
YSP. These were arrested and questioned for one week and were 
freed. I assure you that every detained YSP member was 
released. Undoubtedly, some people were kept after weapons were 
found in their houses and after they were accused of acts of 
hostility, but we released them after one or two weeks. 
  [Al-Jawhari] Have other people from other parties been 
arrested? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] No one from other parties was arrested.

  [Text] Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zindani, member of the 
Presidential Council, today received Robert Douglas Gordon, the 
British ambassador to our country. 
  During the meeting, they discussed bilateral ties, as well 
as 
the current situation and the rebels' noncompliance with the 
cease-fire. 
  The member of the Presidential Council explained the efforts 
that were made and the concessions that were offered in order to 
avoid igniting the fire of sedition and how the rebels insisted 
on sparking it and on departing from legitimacy. He asserted 
that the state does not want war and loves peace. However, he 
added: We are keen on maintaining our unity and the 
independence and sovereignty of our country and the continuation 
of shura and democracy and respecting the people's will, 
represented in the 27 April 1993 elections. 
  For his part, the British ambassador expressed satisfaction 
over the Yemeni government's cooperation with Lakhdar Brahimi, 
the envoy of the UN secretary general. He said that Britain 
supports democracy in Yemen and is anxiously awaiting the report 
that will be presented by the international envoy. 
  Afterward, Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zindani, member of the 
Presidential Council, received Arthur Hughes, the U.S. 
ambassador in Sanaa. 
  They discussed bilateral ties and ways of enhancing them. 
The brother member of the Presidential Council asserted that 
the state had complied with the cease-fire but that the rebels 
violated it. He added: We are waiting for the U.S. Government 
to explain its position toward this. He pointed out that the 
Yemeni Republic appreciates the concern of the brothers and 
friends not to see more Yemeni bloodshed, noting that the war is 
not an end in itself and that it will leave negative effects. 
He said all countries that care about Yemen should seek to end 
the war by not extending any moral or material support to the 
secessionist rebels and ensuring our Yemeni people's rights as 
noted in the UN Charter, primarily freedom, democracy, justice, 
and independence. 
  For his part, the U.S. ambassador expressed his satisfaction 
with the recent cease-fire decision issued by the state, saying 
he deems this a step toward a complete cease-fire. He said the 
United States had earlier asserted that it does not approve of 
recognizing secession and that it seeks dialogue. He expressed 
his belief that new efforts for reconciliation could be made by 
Lakhdar Brahimi in a new visit to the region.

  [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 27 (AFP) -- Southern Yemeni 
authorities have decided to turn Aden's brewery -- the only one 
in the Arabian peninsula -- into a soft drinks factory. 
  The decision was a reaction to northern war propaganda which 
has tagged southerners "beer drinkers and atheists," Yemeni 
sources said. Alcohol is forbidden by Islam. 
  The brewery conversion, announced by Aden television Monday, 
was also aimed at pleasing conservative Gulf monarchs who have 
looked favourably on the south during the two-month-old civil 
war, the sources said. 
  A special committee chaired by the breakaway south's trade 
and industry "minister" Yahya al-Jifri will supervise the 
brewery's conversion, the television said, quoting a decree by 
"president" 'Ali Salim al-Bid. 
  The brewery in al-Mansurah, a northwest suburb of Aden, was 
opened in 1981 with the help of former East Germany. It employs 
200 people. 
  Before war erupted on May 5 the brewery produced a million 
half-litre bottles of beer a month under the trademark Seera. 
Water shortages brought production to a halt at least two weeks 
ago. 
  In 1993 the brewery made a net profit of 100 million Yemeni 
riyals, more than eight million US dollars on the official 
exchange rate. 
  The south declared the breakaway Yemen Democratic Republic 
on 
May 21, two weeks after war broke out between al-Bid's forces 
and northern troops loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Salim Salih Muhammad, Yemeni </F>
Presidential Council member and YSP assistant secretary general, 
in Rabat, by 'Ali al-'Amudi; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Al-'Amudi] Your stay in 
London for medical treatment lasted more than one month. Later, 
it became evident that you were on a mission for the political 
leadership in Aden. Can you tell us about the nature of this 
mission, and did you contact the British Government during that 
period? 
  [Muhammad] We carried out our duty toward our people, who 
are 
being torn apart by this dirty war. The results of our efforts, 
whether with the British, the brothers, or the friends, were 
compatible with what we believe to be our duty. We held many 
meetings at the British Foreign Office, with the parliamentary 
blocs, and with influential political, cultural, and trade 
quarters. The world at large has come to realize the danger of 
what is taking place in Yemen. I believe that the trend is to 
tackle these dangers. We carried out this mission in 
coordination with the leadership, and I would like to reassure 
you that things are proceeding in a coordinated and well-planned 
manner. 
  [Al-'Amudi] Sukhoi-29 aircraft appeared for the first time 
in 
the skies of the northern side. What does this mean? Are we to 
witness a new escalation where the Democratic Republic of Yemen 
will bring into the battle its strategic bombers which, as yet, 
have not entered the battle? 
  [Muhammad] We have information about military aircraft Sanaa 
received through Iran. Some of these aircraft were destroyed in 
Ta'izz airport in an air strike by the aircraft of steadfast 
Aden. With respect to what the southern side has, weapons alone 
will not determine the course and outcome of the battle. What 
will decide the battle will be the position that defends honor, 
dignity, and property against those who decided that the south 
with its inhabitants, villages, and cities is up for grabs for 
the army of Sanaa and its most important tribes. 
  The war will be a protracted one. People will resist the 
invasion, using all means, including new weapons. In this case, 
these weapons will be authorized because they will be used in 
self-defense. 
  [Al-'Amudi] Yahya Mansur Abu-Usba' has said in Cairo that 
steps are being taken to form a provisional YSP command under 
Salih 'Abbad in Sanaa. What does the YSP assistant secretary 
general have to say to this? 
  [Muhammad] Only the YSP central bodies have such a right. 
The war will produce unexpected results on all levels. 
Therefore, it is premature to say anything now. Otherwise, the 
issue will be similar to the many appointments that the Sanaa 
regime announces. 
  I met brother Yahya Abu-Usba' in Cairo. He told me things 
that are very different from what the press reports. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with "South Yemen Defense Minister" </F>
Staff Major General Haytham Qasim Tahir in Aden by Salih Qallab 
in Amman "last night"] 
  [Excerpts] [Qallab] Northern forces have made successes 
on all axes, while your forces are still in a defensive 
position. What are the real causes of that? 
  [Tahir] The other side, that is the ruling military regime 
in Sanaa, prepared for the war a long time ago. And the 
treacherous attacks on our units in the north were real 
"rehearsals" for the war. Besides, the regime in Sanaa has 
pushed all its army and tens of thousands of armed tribes loyal 
to it and 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar [leader of the Yemeni 
Reform Grouping], and all the state's human and material 
resources into this war. 
  As for us, we have confronted this all-out war with modest 
human and material resources. [passage omitted] 
  [Qallab] You spoke about Sudanese and Iraqi participation in 
the fighting against you, but you have failed to prove it 
through POW's, equipment, or anything else...? 
  [Tahir] There is no doubt at all about the participation of 
Iraq, Sudan, and other states in the war alongside the ruling 
military regime in Sanaa. There are Iraqi military personnel 
and soldiers fighting alongside northern forces. A number of 
them were arrested on the Shabwah axis, and the media covered 
this issue then, with both sound and picture. 
  I can confirm to you that the war launched against us is run 
from A to Z by Iraqi experts. Sudan too is participating in the 
war directly or indirectly, proceeding from the alliance 
declared between the two regimes in Sanaa and Khartoum -- the 
alliance in which extremists are playing the major and crucial 
part. 
  The "Afghan Arabs" group is also participating in this war 
alongside northern forces. [passage omitted] 
  [Qallab] Is it true that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih wanted to 
capture Aden, or did he put pressure on this front to keep your 
forces there in order to seize the oil area in Shabwah? 
  [Tahir] 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih will not be able to capture 
Aden or occupy the oil area in Shabwah. All he has done is 
inflict further destruction and ruin on Yemen, killing more 
innocent women, children, and elderly and destroying the 
northern and southern armies. And the days have proved since 
the fighting broke out on 27 April that this war is a losing war 
in which there is no victor, and certainly it will backfire on 
those who ignited it. 
  [Qallab] The northerners accuse you of receiving military 
aid from some neighboring states. What truth is there in these 
accusations? 
  [Tahir] These accusations are designed for the media and to 
divert attention from the aid the other side is receiving from a 
number of states. Media and diplomatic sources abroad have on 
several occasions revealed the names of these states. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Qallab] As is known, you are using Soviet and eastern 
weapons in general. How you have been able to sort matters out 
during the war, especially with regard to spare parts? 
  [Tahir] We have sufficient weapons and equipment to defend 
ourselves and the sovereignty of our state. 
  [Qallab] If a cease-fire is announced, how will the issue of 
the land seized from the "Democratic Republic of Yemen" [DRY] 
during the war be tackled? 
  [Tahir] The cease-fire issue is no longer a Yemeni affair. 
It is now an international affair in accordance with Security 
Council Resolution 924, which was adopted only after 'Ali 
'Abdallah's refusal to respond to the voice of reason and logic 
and all Arab initiatives and appeals to halt this war, whose 
only aim is to kill and destroy. 
  We presented an initiative to form a team of international 
observers to watch and implement the cease-fire and withdraw 
northern forces to their previous positions before the fighting 
broke out. I would like here to stress that we will not abandon 
a single inch of the DRY's territory. [passage omitted] 
  [Qallab] As defense minister of the Republic of Yemen who 
knows a great deal, which is really the quarter planning and 
leading northern operations? 
  [Tahir] I was defense minister of the Republic of Yemen. I 
am now defense minister of the DRY. And I know that the 
military regime in Sanaa planned a long time ago for this 
criminal all-out war against our people in the DRY. I also know 
that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's advisers and Iraqi military experts 
planned and led the military operations against our people. But 
their plans have failed or at least have not been implemented 
according to plan. That is with the exception of inflicting 
further human losses and destroying the economic structure of 
both parts of Yemen, south and north. [passage omitted] 
  [Qallab] Is it true that the northerners are pushing you to 
declare a state in Hadhramaut, make Aden a free zone, and annex 
the governorates seized by northern forces to the north? 
  [Tahir] There is no doubt about that. And when the regime 
in Sanaa talks about legitimacy and unity, it does so for overt 
media and political consumption. But I stress to you that our 
people will fight bravely and valiantly to defend every inch of 
the DRY's territory. 
  [Qallab] What unity formula would you accept after the 
failure of the previous formula, which led to this devastating 
war? 
  [Tahir] It is difficult to talk about any form of unity with 
the Sanaa military regime, which slaughtered unity and wanted to 
annihilate our people, occupy their land, attack their honor, 
and plunder their money and resources. [passage omitted]

  [Text] An official Yemeni spokesman has denied rumors 
circulated by certain Gulf and foreign media that the forces of 
legitimacy violated the cease-fire. 
  In a press statement issued last night, the Yemeni spokesman 
refuted allegations by REUTER and other Gulf news agencies that 
the aircraft of the legitimate forces raided Aden suburbs where 
the rebels are deployed and targeted the drinking water storage 
tanks in the area. The spokesman said these allegations are 
fabricated, noting that the drinking water sources are 
controlled by the forces of legitimacy and not in the hands of 
the rebels. 
  The source criticized reports by the Egyptian Middle East 
News Agency, the United Arab Emirates Television, and the Kuwait 
Television that the forces of legitimacy violated the 
cease-fire. He stressed that this bias in favor of the western 
media organs serve schemes that aim only at harming Yemen and 
the unity of its people and land.

  [Text] An official source has stated that the gang of 
rebels has not abided by the cease-fire since it was announced 
and until now, despite its false claims that it accepted it and 
is committed to implement it. 
  The source said this rebel gang continued its treacherous 
attacks against units of the Armed Forces on the Aden axis and 
against the brother citizens and residential quarters in the 
city. The rebels used naval units and bombarded the positions 
of the forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy from the 
land and sea. They also intensified air sorties over the Armed 
Forces camps in al-Haswah, Dar Sa'd, al-Kamathri, Shaykh 
'Uthman, and other areas. 
  The source stressed that this gang, which sold itself, its 
mind, and conscience to the devil, continues its attacks, 
thinking that this will enable it to arrive at its objective of 
internationalizing the crisis of the domestic sedition which it 
flared to serve and execute its failed traitorous scheme against 
the people and their unity, security, stability.

  [Text] Aden, 27 Jun (MENA) -- The self-declared 
presidential council in south Yemen has called for other 
countries to intervene to stop the constant northern Yemeni 
shelling of civilians and vital institutions in Aden and what it 
termed "the brutal acts of repression by the Sanaa regime in the 
occupied areas." 
  A statement issued by the council and faxed to MENA tonight 
says: "The Sanaa regime has no respect for the resolutions and 
pleas made by the international community. It has consistently 
declared cease-fires, breached them, and blamed the southerners." 
  The statement accuses Sanaa's authorities of depriving 
Aden's 
inhabitants of water, saying that wells are the only source of 
water following the destruction of water pipes and reservoirs 
and the purification station. 
  The statement vows continuing "national resistance in the 
occupied areas" and says that the southerners refuse to 
surrender.

and 100 injured in shelling by north Yemeni forces in the

'Uthman, al Mansurah, Dar Sa'd and 'Umar al Mukhtar districts

  [Excerpt] Aden, June 28 (AFP) -- Northern Yemeni gunners 
blasted the beleaguered southern capital Aden Monday [27 June], 
killing at least 19 people and wounding 180, hospital sources 
said. 
  Units from both north and south Yemen were locked in 
intensive artillery duels around Madinat al-Sha'b, 10 kilometres 
(six miles) west of Aden city centre, where northern forces 
broke through on Saturday. 
  The sound of gunfire could be heard from within Aden itself, 
an AFP correspondent said. 
  Al-Jumhuriyah hospital sources said the day's shelling had 
killed six civilians and wounded a further 56, while 13 soldiers 
were also killed and 124 injured. 
  Since June 11, an estimated 415 civilians have been killed 
and more than 1,100 injured in bombardments in and around Aden, 
according to statistics compiled from official and hospital 
sources. 
  A southern military spokesman said meanwhile that southern 
troops had managed to halt "new attempts by enemy forces to 
progress towards Aden." 
  "Four northern tanks were destroyed and hundreds of enemy 
soldiers and officers killed or wounded," the spokesman said, 
while others had been taken prisoner. 
  A southern statement vowed that "Aden will resist and will 
transform itself into a cemetery for the new invaders." 
  An unspecified number of northern aircraft earlier launched 
a 
raid on Aden's oil refinery, 18 kilometres (10 miles) west of 
the city, the southern spokesman said, adding ground defences 
had downed one plane. 
  Eyewitnesses said two planes fired four missiles at the 
refinery, one of which hit an empty building. Another damaged 
pipelines. 
  A spokesman for the north in Sanaa denied its planes had 
launched an air raid. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] This morning the city of Aden was subjected to 
more violent artillery and missile shelling by northern Yemeni 
forces. Medical sources in Aden said that 15 people were injured 
in the shelling against the northern outskirts of Aden. 
  A southern Yemeni military source said that the battles 
between the northern and southern forces resumed on all fronts 
surrounding the city and said that it was noticed during 
yesterday's and today's battles that the Sanaa forces used 
modern tanks which were not in the possession of the northern 
forces before or after unification. Southern Yemeni officials 
had announced earlier that the southern forces foiled an attack 
launched by northern Yemeni forces to control a main road 
leading to the city of Aden in a suburb where the refinery is 
situated. They said that a northern force composed of hundreds 
of soldiers preceded by three tanks was able for a short while 
to block the road leading to the area where the refinery is 
situated but the road was reopened yesterday afternoon after the 
northern forces were driven back. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Habib Tarabulsi] </F>
  [Text] Dubai, June 28 (AFP) -- Rival northern and southern 
Yemeni forces are using fatwas or religious decrees, issued by 
Muslim leaders of both parties, to justify continued fighting in 
their bloody civil war. 
  In the north, the powerful Islamic movement al-Islah, which 
backs President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, sees the conflict as a 
"jihad" or holy war against the "atheists" of the Yemen 
Socialist Party (YSP) in the south. 
  Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, al-Islah leader, told 
journalists recently that the war between north and south was "a 
holy war that must not be stopped, even if it costs a million 
lives." 
  Al-Ahmar, also speaker in the northern-dominated parliament, 
repeated in his name a fatwa issued previously by 'Abd-al-Wahhab 
al-Daylami, another al-Islah leader. 
  Sanaa radio broadcast the fatwa, which declared that "a 
ceasefire in the war against the atheists is against the Islamic 
Shariah (law)." 
  Al-Daylami, a professor at Sanaa university, advocated "the 
continuation of the jihad against the secessionists, including 
women and children." 
  His appeal was repeated by imams, or prayer leaders, in 
Sanaa 
mosques during Friday prayers. 
  But southern mullahs -- Muslim scholars -- close to the YSP 
immediately condemned the northern fatwa as "heresy." 
  Southern mullah Sa'id 'Ali Nur responded with another 
televised fatwa, calling on Yemenis to "put an end to this 
fratricidal war" and reminding them that the Koran forbids 
"brother Muslims" to kill each other. 
  However, other mullahs in the southern Hadhramaut province 
issued a statement calling on southerners to "use their 
legitimate right of self-defence" to "push back the (northern) 
invaders." 
  The statement, broadcast on Radio Aden, added: "Our 
religious 
and national duty tells us to carry out a just fight against the 
forces of evil, who plunder our wealth and attack our honour." 
  'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri, appointed vice president of the 
breakaway southern state, used Friday prayers in Aden's 
principal mosque to condemn "the call to murder innocent women 
and children." 
  But al-Jifri, head of the moderate Islamic party League of 
the Sons of Yemen, called for calm from the faithful who 
demanded revenge attacks on northern residential areas. 
  He said al-Islah was "regressive." YSP leaders have accused 
the movement of protecting members of the shadowy fundamentalist 
group Jihad, which has carried out attacks on southern targets. 
  Al-Jifri also challenged northerner Shaykh 'Abd-al Majid 
Zindani to a televised debate on the war of the fatwas. 
  Al-Zindani is a member of the presidential council at Sanaa, 
as well as being the leading theorist of al-Islah and a declared 
enemy of southern "atheists." 
  Al-Jifri said the TV debate would be refereed by the 
principal theological authority for Sunni Muslims -- Shaykh Jad 
al-Haqq 'Ali Jad al-Haqq, vice chancellor of Al-Azhar university 
in Cairo. 
  Al-Zindani has not yet risen to the challenge. 
  In the meantime Shaykh 'Abd-al-Aziz Bin-'Abdallah Bin-Baz, 
head of the highest religious authority in neighbouring Saudi 
Arabia, sent an "urgent appeal" to Yemeni leaders for an 
"immediate halt to this fratricidal war." 
  War broke out between Salih's forces and those of his 
southern rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid on May 5. 
  The south declared the breakaway Yemen Democratic Republic 
on 
May 21, ending four years of uneasy unity since former 
conservative North Yemen merged with the Marxist South.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Commenting on the U.S. stance, 
which is trying to abort and obstruct the attempts being made by 
Lebanon and other states to secure a resolution from the UN 
Security Council condemning "Israel" for its attacks on Lebanon, 
the latest of which was the savage raid on al-Biqa' on 2 June, 
Hizballah issued the following statement: 
  Following the massacre that the Zionist enemy committed 
against our people, who want to live in freedom and dignity, we 
are not surprised by the recent U.S. positions, which form a 
political and diplomatic shield for the enemy. The enemy's 
violation of the land and people; its resorting to acts of 
kidnapping, murder, and destruction; its breaching all 
international laws, norms, and charters; its pursuit of a policy 
of organized terrorism and brutal aggression against our nation; 
and its disregard for world public opinion are all the result of 
its feeling of impunity under the U.S. umbrella. The United 
States pays no attention to laws and human rights slogans when 
the issue concerns "Israel's" violations and attacks. 
  The justifications used by the U.S. Administration to 
prevent 
the condemnation of "Israel" are based on the need to continue 
the peace talks and to disregard anything that might obstruct or 
jeopardize these talks. This means releasing "Israel's" hand to 
commit more crimes and attacks as long as the victim has no 
right to complain and the international community is not obliged 
to condemn the aggressor. This also means the shedding of more 
of our blood and our people's blood on the altar of 
negotiations. Concern for continuing these negotiations has 
become a cover and a justification for the continuing and 
unrelenting Israeli aggression. All this is taking place under 
the shadow of a domineering and tyrannical U.S. policy that is 
persistently trying to control UN bodies and organizations 
including the UN General Assembly. The United States wants to 
use the United Nations to serve its policy and to make it an 
obedient tool condoning the injustice and aggression practiced 
by "Israel" with U.S. support and protection. The United States 
has disregarded all international rules and norms and has 
adopted a policy of double standards. This is proved by the 
United States not applying the same international rules and laws 
on "Israel" that it firmly applies in other regions and 
countries. 
  The U.S. claim that what is taking place is between "Israel" 
and Hizballah and does not concern the Lebanese Government is a 
false claim. It can be refuted by the wonderful solidarity 
displayed toward the Resistance and with which Lebanon--its 
Government, political forces, and people, with their various 
groups and tendencies--responded to the Israeli crime. This 
proves that the Resistance has become the mecca of all 
Lebanon--Government, parties, and people. This Resistance is 
the truest expression of the entire Lebanese people's rejection 
of the Israeli occupation and their position, standing in one 
trench in confronting it and foiling its plans against the land, 
sovereignty, civil peace, and all the foundations of national 
unity among all the Lebanese. 
  We ask: How long will decisions be imposed on people and how 
long will injustice and aggression be practiced against them? 
How long will international political and economic 
organizations remain hostage to the United States such that they 
have become establishments and offices appended to the U.S. 
State Department?

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz by Rafiq </F>
Nasrallah in Beirut; date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [Nasrallah] The United States is said to have 
asked Lebanon to hold separate talks with Israel. How do you 
respond? 
  [Buwayz] The Lebanese media characteristically jump the gun 
on political events. To date, we have not received any 
invitation to restart the negotiations -- neither from the 
United States nor from any other country. Reports about 
separate deals, thus, do not add up. 
  I think there will be a kind of dynamism which the United 
States will deploy both in regard to the Lebanese and Syrian 
files. This initiative has yet to take shape. We don't know 
yet whether it will it take the shape of Christopher's upcoming 
visit to the region or an invitation to restart the negotiations? 
  [Nasrallah] There has been a major development recently in 
the the Jordanian-Israeli track. How do you think this will 
impact the overall negotiations, particularly regarding Lebanon, 
and more especially given that southern Lebanon is on the 
threshold of a major Israeli military escalation. Lebanon is 
said to have been issued with what you might call an ultimatum 
through the U.S. channel. 
  [Buwayz] Israeli threats are nothing new as far as Lebanon 
is concerned. We have lived with them for many years. I can 
tell you for certain, however, that such ultimatums will not 
affect Lebanon's agenda. 
  Lebanon has incurred a heavy price in terms of its 
sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity. We are 
not quitting half way down the road. The point I want to make 
is that southern Lebanon will remain in a state of tension as 
long as the Israeli occupation of the area remains and its 
people are living under coercion. Any attempts to put an end to 
practices [of resistance] in the south will not succeed as long 
as the occupation remains in place. The only way out is for 
Israel to start departing the south and reassuring the Lebanese 
that it does not covet their land or resources. Resistance in 
southern Lebanon is not a hobby pursued for its own sake. No 
one wants to die for the sake of it. Those who die are giving 
their souls for the sake of a cause which the they believe to be 
a worthy one. National resistance is the outcome rather than 
the cause of occupation. 
  [Nasrallah] Would you say that the developments in the 
Jordanian-Israeli track has put an end to the cordon states 
formula? 
  [Buwayz] We must see what happened on the Joran-Israel front 
in perspective. Let's not blow it out of all proportion. 
Naturally we would have liked Jordan to stay with us and 
committed to the Madrid formula that gave birth to the bilateral 
talks that took place in Washington. From our point of view, 
the failure of the talks to make substantive progress, 
especially on the Lebanese and Syrian tracks, does not warrant 
the relocation of the negotiations from Washington to the 
region. The movement of the negotiations from Washington takes 
them away from the spotlight of world public opinion. At the 
same time, the move reduces the American involvement and keeps 
the United States from playing its role in full. Both in form 
and content the Washington talks meet the requirements of the 
peace process. 
  We would have liked Jordan to remain committed along with us 
to the mechanism agreed to in Washington. As to the contention 
that Jordan has gone its own way and signed, I have yet to hear 
that Jordan has signed a peace treaty in the strict sense. The 
two sides have agreed for the talks to be moved from Washington 
to the Middle East, specifically to Jordan and Israel. Such a 
step, in our assessment, could have waited. Again, to our 
knowledge, Jordan has not signed a peace treaty. [passage
