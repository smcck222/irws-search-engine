<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with former Prime Minister Leonid </F>
Kuchma, by Oksana Mykhaylenko; place and date not given: 
"Peninsula of Instability or Compromise?"] 
  [Text] [Kuchma] Ukraine can develop by either choosing the 
African way or the civilized one, that is European, Japanese, or 
South Korean. We need new technologies and not shovels. 
  [Mykhaylenko] What role in this process do you assign to 
Russia? 
  [Kuchma] Given that Japan, for instance, is trying to 
initiate close ties with Russia why should Ukraine disrupt them? 
Ukraine entirely depends on Russian raw materials. In light of 
this, we should proceed from existing realities. Ukraine sells 
80 percent of its products to Russia. If we lose this market we 
will never be able to reclaim it. Our economy must not be 
closed to the outside world. I am ready to personally greet 
large Japanese firms thath will arrive in Ukraine with their 
investments and new technologies. Everything that will be 
manufactured on Ukraine's territory will remain there. 
  [Mykhaylenko] How do you treat the idea voiced by both 
Crimean President Meshkov and Ostankino, who maintain that the 
aggravation of the situation in Crimea is used to postpone 
presidential elections in Ukraine? 
  [Kuchma] I would not like to be so blunt, but certain 
nuances of this kind seem conceivable. It is possible to annul 
presidential elections under the current circumstances. Who is 
interested in annulling them? The president. Thus both you and 
I have grounds to ask this kind of question. 
  [Mykhaylenko] Are you going to visit Crimea? 
  [Kuchma] My visit to Crimea would be inexpedient. We have 
the president, while I am often depicted as the pro-Russian 
enemy No. 1. The president should proceed from the belief that 
future generations will not forgive us faulty steps. Once we 
gave Crimea autonomy why raise a turmoil? 
  [Mykhaylenko] Crimean Supreme Soviet Chairman Tsekov 
suggests that Ukraine join Russia along with Crimea. 
  [Kuchma] However I have never said this. Is it not clear 
that those are just political games and a fight for power? 
  [Mykhaylenko] In light of current relations between Ukraine 
and Crimea, what compromises can the Ukrainian and Crimean 
legislatures reach? 
  [Kuchma] Legislative speaker Moroz should go to Crimea and 
start negotiating. There is only one way to improve the 
situation, namely by creating conditions for the economic 
development in the Crimea. Perhaps form a free economic zone. 
China does not want to take Hong Kong back, because the latter 
is profitable for China. 
  [Mykhaylenko] What concessions should Crimea make? 
  [Kuchma] Crimea should acknowledge that it is and will 
remain a part of Ukraine.

  [Text] A candidate for the Ukrainian presidency, Leonid 
Kuchma, has said that his first step in the office would be to 
reconstruct 90 percent of Ukraine's enterprises like West 
Germany is doing in East Germany. Speaking at a news conference 
in Kiev Wednesday [1 June], he pointed out that he pinned his 
hopes on private foreign capital rather than centralized western 
aid in the resolution of economic issues. 
  "We have no hope for a Marshall plan, that is why Ukraine 
should rely on its own forces in the first place," Kuchma was 
quoted as saying. He added that it was necessary to create such 
rules of the games that western partners did not fear to lose 
their investments. 
  Commenting on his initiative to grant Crimea special status 
announced in parliament Wednesday, Kuchma said he meant the 
status of a free economic area. It is necessary to give Crimea 
more economic independence rather than take back powers, he said 
adding that Crimea should be kept within the Ukrainian state 
borders,. 
  The presidential elections in Ukraine will be held on 26 
June. 
  Leonid Kuchma is Ukraine's former prime minister, presently 
the president of the Ukrainian Industrialists and Entrepreneurs' 
Union and the leader of the Interregional Bloc for Reforms.

  [Text] Kiev June 1 TASS -- "The wrong regional policy of 
the former Soviet Union and the uncertainty of the fate of the 
Black Sea Fleet are the top two objective causes of the Crimean 
problem," Ukrainian parliament chairman Oleksandr Moroz said. 
  Speaking at a session of the parliament on Wednesday, Moroz 
said that among the subjective causes are "intolerance in 
solving ethnic problems and the clash of several nationalist 
tendencies." 
  "It is necessary now to neutralise these factors as soon as 
possible by restoring economic ties and providing conditions for 
normal rest and recreation in the Crimea," Moroz said. 
  He stressed that Ukraine must use all possible diplomatic 
channels to ease tension and put the problem within the 
constitutional framework, without using force.

<F P=106> ["Appeal by the session of the Lvov Oblast Council of </F>
People's Deputies to the president of Ukraine and the Ukrainian 
Supreme Council"; date not given] 
  [Text] Esteemed Mr. President and Mr. Chairman, esteemed 
deputies! 
  The session of the Lvov Oblast Council of people's deputies 
is alarmed by the fact that the current political situation in 
Ukraine poses a serious threat to the processes of developing 
the state. 
  The June elections of the president of Ukraine and of local 
bodies of power, which are to be held under the constitutional 
crisis, were further exacerbated by the absence of an 
appropriate legal basis and society's distinct stance with 
regard to the state structure and the bodies of power. 
Presuming that the people of Ukraine are the sole and superior 
representatives of power on Ukraine's territory, the elections 
should be held only after all citizens-electors and candidates 
to the elected bodies fully comprehend both the functions and 
powers of the newly elected administration. Otherwise, such 
elections will not guarantee the full scope of civil rights, 
while the electors will become the victims of political fraud 
and manipulations and guinea pigs for endless exhausting 
political experiments. 
  Attempts to introduce the federative-oblast territorial 
structure of the state during the June elections, while no 
appropriate constitutional basis yet exists, may initiate a 
broad expansion of separatist processes, a dismembering of 
Ukraine, and antistate activities, which have recently been 
vividly demonstrated in Crimea. 
  We, the deputies of the Lvov Oblast Council of People's 
Deputies, demand that both the elections of the president and of 
local bodies of power be postponed by the period necessary for 
the Supreme Council to adopt the law on the structure and powers 
of administration.

<F P=106> [Appeal by the session of the Lvov Oblast Council of </F>
people's deputies to the president of Ukraine and the Ukrainian 
Supreme Council; date not given] 
  [Text] Esteemed Mr. President and Mr. Chairman, esteemed 
deputies! 
  We, the deputies of the Lvov Oblast Council of People's 
Deputies are gravely concerned with the escalation of the 
activities of separatist antistate anti-Ukrainian forces in 
Crimea, supported by the Crimean president, the Crimean Supreme 
Soviet leadership, and imperial-chauvinistic forces in Russia. 
Supporting the Ukrainian president's recent statement regarding 
the situation in Crimea, we hope that the administration will 
take decisive consequent measures to safeguard the unity and 
integrity of the Ukrainian state, and thus, prevent the 
escalation of anti-Ukrainian moves on its territory. 
  In light of the tense political situation in Crimea we 
demand 
that: 
  Measures be taken to discontinue the antistate and 
anti-Ukrainian propaganda carried out by Russian mass media on 
the territory of Ukraine; 
  Measures be taken to strengthen Ukraine's northern and 
eastern borders to prevent the infiltration into our territory 
of foreign military formations and arms. Appropriate 
governmental structures be requested to pay attention to the 
deployment of Russian troops along Ukrainian borders. 
  To discontinue further development of separatist activities 
in Crimea a state of emergency be proclaimed there and direct 
presidential rule introduced. 
  Proceeding from the provisions of the tripartite agreement 
of 
Ukraine, Russia, and the United States, unilateral nuclear 
disarmament of Ukraine be suspended until the international 
community provides distinct guarantees of Ukraine's territorial 
integrity and Russian troops are altogether withdrawn from the 
territory of the Ukrainian state.

  1. To suspend the activities of the territorial and 75 
district commissions for the elections of the chairman and 
deputies of the oblast council until a law is adopted on the

  2. The resolution becomes valid on the day of adoption.

<F P=106> [Report by Viktor Kozoriz from the Chernobyl Atomic Electric </F>
Power Plant-Slavutych-Kiev: "The Exoneration of the Atom. Yet 
Another Attempt"] 
  [Text] If you remember correctly, the first attempt was 
made by the Supreme Council, which, contrary to logic and common 
sense, called off its own moratorium on the construction of 
atomic units and canceled its own decree on closing down the 
Chernobyl Atomic Plant. 
  The Chernobyl Atomic Electric Power Plant [AES], named after 
V.I. Lenin, lives and... I nearly said... "prospers." The 
situation is, of course, far from prosperity, as it also is from 
closing down. I became convinced of that last Friday [27 May], 
during the visit to the Chernobyl AES by Ukrainian President 
Leonid Kravchuk. I have no doubt presidents do not frequently 
visit such facilities, and when they do, it is not for mere 
trifles. 
  What led Leonid Makarovych to the Chernobyl Plant? In order 
to rule out various interpretations of the trip's objective, the 
radio and television efficiently informed the public and 
conveyed the president's ideas on the prospects of atomic power 
engineering in Ukraine and did so, so to speak, close to the 
text. In turn, the public response came quickly. The next day, 
I overheard the following conversation on crowded Kiev bus 
number 16: 
  "Did you hear what Kravchuk said? No one intends to close 
down Chernobyl. On the contrary, new units will be 
commissioned." 
  "Maybe they will even start the fourth unit?" 
  "Who knows? He says that Ukraine will plunge into an energy 
crisis without Chernobyl." 
  "An energy crisis is better than yet another Chernobyl. I 
wish we could survive that one." 
  Indeed, at the meeting with representatives of labor 
collectives and trade union leaders of the Chernobyl AES, the 
Ukrainian president stated that it is still early for us to 
dismiss the Chernobyl AES and generally too early to write off 
atomic power engineering. That is why the concept of the 
Program for the Development of Atomic Power Engineering in 
Ukraine had already been elaborated. One can expect that the 
program also takes into account the Chernobyl AES. At any rate, 
Leonid Makarovych [Kravchuk] repeated several times that no one 
was going to close it down. It is another matter that the world 
community wants this very much, but if it really wants this very 
much, it must loosen its purse strings and pay... $14 billion. 
  Despite such a statement, the Ukrainian president gave more 
arguments in favor of continuing the operation of the Chernobyl 
AES. However, I personally did not find them convincing. Take, 
for example, the following argument: The whole Europe abounds 
in atomic plants. Or: In terms of some safety parameters, the 
Chernobyl AES is in a much better shape than other similar 
plants, and so on. Who knows better than Ukraine how safe the 
Chernobyl AES is. However, it appears that the president 
himself was not quite sure of the validity of his words -- in 
particular, those that concerned safety, but he was compelled to 
defend the position of the so-called atomic lobby. The atomic 
lobby knows what it is defending. 
  It must be said that, as soon as the correspondents' pickup 
crossed the border of the exclusion zone, representatives of 
that lobby immediately got down to work. The correspondents 
were actively persuaded that it is damaging to close down the 
Chernobyl AES and that it is safe. One would think we were not 
going to the atomic plant known to the world by the catastrophe 
but to a Black Sea resort place. Just eight years have passed 
since the accident! Eight! Have we forgotten everything? 
  At the plant, the correspondents were in for a small 
surprise. The program for the president's stay at the Chernobyl 
AES has envisaged a visit to the premises of the Central Control 
Board. They say it is located right above the reactor. A 
historic moment was planned there -- the president poses before 
photographers over the reactor, something that might symbolize 
its perfect safety. While the entire team of correspondents 
climbed to point 35 and prepared the equipment for the 
sensational shot, it turned out that certain changes had been 
made in the program. In short, the president did not rise to 
point 35, and so the historical and sensational shot was not 
made. Instead, my colleagues took as many photographs as they 
wanted in Slavutych, where Leonid Makarovych went to personally 
meet with residents of the town of power engineers. There, 
Leonid Makarovych repeated what he said in Chernobyl and added 
that the residents of Slavutych should not worry about their 
future, meaning that they will not remain without work. I do not 
know whether the Slavutych residents are pleased with such 
prospects, but I am convinced that the majority of the Ukrainian 
population will not be enthusiastic about it. 
  The exoneration of atomic power engineering is a thankless 
and dangerous deed, all the more so since the people still 
experience the bitter aftertaste. It is really necessary to 
hurry up?

<F P=106> [Ihor Nykorovych report on interview with Ukrainian Deputy </F>
Defense Minister Ivan Bizhan with unidentified correspondents: 
"The Deputy Minister Is Pleased With the State of Affairs in 
Our Troops"] 
  [Text] We have already reported that a large group of 
officers from the Defense Ministry headed by Deputy Minister of 
Defense Colonel General Ivan Bizhan visited our oblast on an 
inspection mission. After the commission finished its work, the 
colonel general, as he had promised, met with representatives of 
the local mass media. The new commander of the Ciscarpathian 
Military District, Colonel General Petro Shulyak, and the 
commander of the formation, Major General Anatoliy Kalashnykov 
were also present at the news conference. 
  The deputy minister pointed out that it was the first time 
that such an inspection was conducted in the Ukrainian Armed 
Forces. It so happened that the inspection started precisely 
with the formation whose headquarters is situated in our oblast. 
The goal of the inspection was to see the actual state of 
combat readiness of our troops. 
  According to Colonel General I. Bizhan, proper attention is 
being given to combat training in the formation. The units are 
ready to fulfill their tasks, although things are not in perfect 
order everywhere. However, there are objective reasons for 
that. For example, this year, the funds allocated for combat 
training were quite limited. It is, therefore, difficult to 
expect good results from those servicemen, who, for example, 
could not take the complete course of training due to the 
shortage of fuel. At the same time, there are commanders who, 
on the pretext of difficulties, do not do their work at all. 
Consequently, organizational measures will also be taken based 
on the results of the inspection. 
  The deputy minister pointed out that he was very familiar 
with our formation and that, after new commander Major General 
A. Kalashnykov took over, the situation in the troops changed 
for the better. There is every reason to believe that the 
shortcomings revealed by the inspection will be eliminated. 
  Then Colonel General I. Bizhan answered the following 
questions by journalists. 
  [Question] How do the Ukrainian Armed Forces compare to 
armies of other states, for example, Russia? 
  [Bizhan] I wouldn't say that the Ukrainian Armed Forces are 
trained worse than the Russian ones. Just two years ago, they 
were within the same army. Nor are there, so far, any problems 
with up-to-date weapons or military technology. However, I am 
concerned about the future. We do not have funds for developing 
new types of weapons or technology. That is why, in about five 
to 10 years, the Ukrainian Army may find itself in quite a 
difficult situation. 
  [Question] At present, the question of creating some 
independent armed forces is being raised in the Crimea. What is 
your attitude toward this? What is, in general, your attitude 
toward the problem of the [Crimean] peninsula? 
  [Bizhan] Both we and leaders of other states, in particular, 
the United States and Russia, regard the Crimea as a constituent 
part of our state. After all, this question is political rather 
than military, and armed forces must an external party. At the 
same time, we take into account the situation in the Crimea and 
the way in which it may change. The creation of any militarized 
formations there is at variance with the laws of our state. 
Well, this is, so far, at the level of talk and plans. 
However, we are alarmed by the fact that these ideas are voiced 
by Crimean leaders. That is why, if they start doing anything 
for the implementation of those ideas, I think that it will also 
be necessary to take practical measures to counter their 
activities. 
  [Question] What specific assistance could our oblast render 
to the units of the formation stationed on its territory? 
  [Bizhan] The shortage of housing is one of the most painful 
problems of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. More than 80,000 of 
Ukraine's officers and warrant officers have no apartments. 
Military construction bodies would be able to build housing, but 
the lack of funds prevents them from doing that. I know that 
other people are also confronted by this problem, but if we 
could get local help in this question, the army would greatly 
appreciate it.

<F P=106> ["Statement by the Communist Faction `For Social Justice and </F>
Sovereignty of the People'"] 
  [Text] The very name of our deputies group indicates that 
we are consistently fulfilling the will of the voters and our 
election programs. 
  During this critical period marked by the collapse of the 
economy and financial system, the impoverishment of the working 
people, the wild outburst of organized crime, and the 
manifestations of separatism that threaten the very existence of 
our state and realizing the whole burden of responsibility for 
the fate of Ukraine, we Communists called upon all factions of 
the Supreme Council to constructively cooperate in order to 
extricate the state from the impasse. 
  As the most numerous deputies group in the parliament, we 
have a moral right to claim the highest posts in the parliament. 
However, in order to avoid bitter confrontations in the 
struggle for the seats and to proceed, as soon as possible, to 
resolving painful economic jumbles, the Communists have not 
become preoccupied with their party ambitions. They acted in an 
optimal manner, something that is attested to by the quite 
concerted election of the Supreme Council chairman. 
  Quite naturally, we also expected mutual understanding from 
our opponents. However, as early as on 19 May, when the 
question of electing first deputy chairman of the Supreme 
Council was discussed, the right-wing forces declared that their 
representative alone had to become first deputy chairman. Even 
without starting a normal parliamentary discussion, they 
disrupted the work of the session. Having applied known methods 
of the old parliament, they simply failed to register, having 
thereby disrupted the normal work. They are those same people 
who sowed dissent in the preceding Supreme Council. 
  Voters must know the names of those deputies for whom power, 
and not the state, is all that matters. 
  Particularly alarming is the fact that some representatives 
of the "power party" and power structures have united with 
national extremists. Using their official position, they resort 
to putting pressure upon the left-wing forces. 
  Almost all mass media have taken their side and are 
assailing 
the left-wing forces in an organized manner. They employ 
well-tested methods of juggling with facts, which is also 
attested to by today's statements by the groups "Statehood" 
[Derzhavnist] and "Center" [Tsentr]. 
  The most dangerous thing is the fact that this assault by 
the 
right-wing forces is taking place in the context of Crimean 
events, which have recently become particularly exacerbated. In 
this connection, the communist faction calls upon its supporters 
in the Crimea to do everything possible in order that peace and 
harmony would prevail on the peninsula for the benefit of all of 
Ukraine's peoples. 
  We state unequivocally that those forces that are presently 
disrupting the work of the parliament are supporting the cause 
of separatism. 
  Standing up, firmly and consistently, for the interests of 
the voters, we will do everything we can in order to achieve 
peace and harmony in our society. However, the public must also 
know about those who oppose this. That is why we reserve the 
right to efficiently inform the voters about the events in the 
parliament.

<F P=106> [Report by Volodymyr Prytula, MOLOD UKRAYINY special </F>
correspondent: "Cossacks Have Arrived!"] 
  [Text] Last Saturday [28 May], the so-called "Great 
Cossack Assembly" with the participation of leaders of the 
Ukrainian and Russian cossackdom was to be held in Simferopol. 
However, in all likelihood, the organizers of the action had a 
purely political goal -- to help local separatists. That is why 
nothing came out of the "Great Assembly." Representatives of 
the majority of Russia's cossack regions did not arrive at the 
assembly. Ukrainian cossacks stated their protest to organizers 
of the provocation. Hetman [cossack leader] of the Ukrainian 
Zaporizhzhya cossackdom General V. Mulyava qualified the holding 
of the "assembly" as interference into the internal affairs of 
our state. Regional organizations of the Ukrainian cossackdom 
received a telegram signed by Hetman Mulyava ordering them to be 
ready to defend Ukraine's territorial integrity. The 
make-believe cossack conference concluded with the report from 
Simferopol's Kievskiy Rayon Department of Internal Affairs: In 
the "Moskva" hotel, a group of "cossacks" raped a woman, who was 
also staying at that hotel....

<F P=106> ["Epistle by the Anti-Fascist Committee of the Ukrainian </F>
Nationalist Assembly"; date not given] 
  [Text] The alliance of the left- and right-wing forces 
within the Supreme Council of new convocation against the people 
has opened up the road toward political fascism in Ukraine. As 
has always been in history, irresponsible liberal-bourgeois 
political intriguers are the motive force for the political 
fascistization of Ukrainian society. Mr. Chornovil's political 
blocs in the Supreme Council are nothing more than an attempt to 
reduce the pro-fascist factors of various denominations to a 
common denominator. The comprador-like Ukrainian bourgeoise and 
its master -- transnational capital -- have sensed a threat to 
their own existence. Hence the hysterical appeals to "law" and 
"force" that both the "left-" and "right-wing" to which 
candidates are resorting. 
  The fascistization of Ukrainian society proceeds to the 
accompaniment of the loud cacophony of the bourgeois mass media. 
The self-styled "political scientists" and "analysts" 
deliberately misinform the audience on the situation in the 
country. The only difference between their views lies in the 
fact that some of them do this to their own advantage and 
ambitions, while others do this to satisfy the social demands of 
a certain class. Through the efforts of the Ukrainian press and 
television, reality has been transformed into a distorting 
mirror. They even went so far as to declare the UNA-UNSO 
[Ukrainian Nationalist Assembly-Ukrainian National Self- 
Defense] a "pro-fascist organization." Some people believe this! 
  Some people believe because alongside the political 
fascistization of Ukraine, a cultural one is taking place -- 
something that is bringing about a fascistization of society at 
a social level. Editorials of Ukraine's leading bourgeois 
newspaper, which claims to be liberally unblemished, consist of 
dirt: slander against the UNA-UNSO as a basis for political 
disinformation, corruption of spiritual values by criminal 
chronicles, and the cultural ersatz of provincial banality. 
  Is it anything but the ideal of "total mediocrity" -- the 
goal of fascism in culture? 
  Direct agents of foreign forces in the person of various 
left-wing, right-wing, and "ethnic" radicals are playing a 
provocative role in the fascistization of Ukrainian society. 
  The political phraseology of the Ukrainian "eternal past" 
figures betrays their master. The liberation movement of 
Russian Slavs could be destroyed by the simple trick with 
internationalism ["mondalizm"] and was driven underground. This 
recipe is now being implemented in Ukraine. 
  Beware of Gallic coachmen bringing the gifts of the Danaans. 
People, the UNA-UNSO loves you. Take care!

"Ukraine Is Concluding the Most Advantageous Oil Agreement in 
Its History"] 
  [Text] As became known to the UKRINFORM correspondent from 
reliable sources, Ukraine's acting Prime Minister Yukhym 
Zvyahilskyy had reached an agreement with Western investors on 
granting Ukraine an interest-free credit for purchasing crude 
oil. 
  Thus, it has become possible to purchase 12 million tonnes 
of 
crude oil, mainly from Russia, at $60 per tonne. 
  This is the lowest price at which Ukraine has ever managed 
to 
import oil after the prices of energy sources within the former 
USSR were raised to those prevailing in the world. Petroleum 
products from this oil will, primarily, be channeled for 
satisfying the needs of the country's agriculture. Owing to 
this contract, the problem of fuel for agricultural needs has 
largely been resolved. This will make it possible to conduct 
the entire necessary cycle of agricultural work in full and in 
good time.

  [Text] Moscow, June 1 (YONHAP) -- Some 200 Taeguk-ki 
(Korean national flag)-waving ethnic Koreans welcomed President 
Kim Yong-sam as he arrived at Cheremetyevo Airport here 
Wednesday for a four-day state visit to Russia. 
  President Kim, accompanied by First Lady Son Myong-sun 
aboard 
a Korean Air chartered plane, was welcomed by the Russian 
Government protocol officer and Korean Ambassador to Moscow Kim 
Suk-kyu. 
  The presidential plane touched down at 3:30 PM (Moscow time) 
and the chief executive showed no signs of fatigue despite the 
10 and a half-hour flight from Seoul. He waved at the welcoming 
crowd as he came down the ramp. 
  Kim was then received by First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg 
Soskovets and Russian Ambassador to Seoul Georgiy Kunadze before 
reviewing an honor guard and saluting the two countries' flags 
as their national anthems were played. 
  After exchanging greetings with Vice Foreign Minister 
Alexandr Panov and other Russian Government leaders, the Kims 
received bouquets of flowers from the children of Korean 
residents -- Shin Yong-un and Kim Pyong-su -- and shook hands 
with many ethnic Koreans who had come out to welcome them. 
  -- Shortly after his chartered plane took off from Seoul 
Airport, President Kim changed into causal attire and, in a 
relaxed mood, entered the sections where members of the official 
entourage and the press corps were sitting and shook hands with 
each of them. 
  When a reporter reminded him that many leaders of opposition 
parties, including chairman Yi Ki-taek of the Democratic Party, 
had come out to Seoul Airport to see him off, the president 
quipped: "Aren't all trying to engage in big-time politics?" 
  As the plane flew through Japanese air space, Kim summoned 
Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and other members of the official 
entourage to his "office in the air" and had a brief chat. 
  At the meeting, Gen. Yi Yang-ho, chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs 
of Staff, told the president that because of North Korea, the 
plane had to go to Khabarovsk via Niigata, taking an extra two 
hours. 
  "We should be able to fly directly (to Khabarosvk) soon," 
Kim 
said, obviously alluding to a time when the country is unified 
and airlines can fly directly to anywhere from Seoul. 
  -- During the brief meeting with his official entourage, Kim 
remembered that the National Assembly Foreign Affairs and 
National Unification Committee was to hold a special session on 
the North Korean nuclear row. 
  Talking to Rep. Chong Chae-mun, chairman of the committee, 
the president asked jokingly: "Now that you are here, who is 
going to preside over the session?" 
  "(The committee's) manager Rep. Kang Shin-cho can do that," 
Chong replied, seriously but with a smile.

<F P=106> [Interview with ROK President Kim Yong-sam by IZVESTIYA </F>
Chief Editor Igor Golembiovskiy in Seoul; date not given: "`We 
Must Combine Our Technologies and Your Potential.' ROK 
President Kim Yong-sam Answers IZVESTIYA Chief Editor Igor 
Golembiovskiy's Questions"] 
  [Excerpt] [Golembiovskiy] Mr. President, you were the 
first South Korean politician to come to Moscow. That was five 
years ago. You played an important role in establishing 
diplomatic relations between Moscow and Seoul, which presaged 
the most extensive links between our countries. Why, in your 
view, have Russian-Korean relations proved to be so modest? 
  [Kim] As you have correctly remarked, I was the first South 
Korean politician to visit the Soviet Union. Afterward, in 
March 1990, I visited the USSR again. At that time there were 
no diplomatic relations between our countries, and therefore my 
visits were extremely difficult. Official diplomatic relations 
between the ROK and the USSR were established six months after 
my visit; I think that even my modest efforts played a part in 
this. 
  Relations between our countries have been developing very 
dynamically since September 1990 right up until the present 
moment. The treaty signed between the ROK and the Russian 
Federation during President B. Yeltsin's visit to the ROK in 
November 1992 became the systemic basis for the development of 
bilateral relations. Relations in the political, economic, 
social, cultural, and other spheres are being developed on this 
basis. In the political sphere, in addition to top-level 
bilateral visits, frequent exchanges have taken place at the 
level of foreign ministers and other state figures. 
  Trade turnover between the two countries last year reached 
almost $1.6 billion, almost twice the level of the previous 
year. This testifies to a dramatic growth in our economic 
relations. 
  The number of visits by citizens of the two countries has 
also grown. Thus last year 18,000 Russians visited the ROK, 
almost twice as many as in the previous year. But at the same 
time, when I say that our relations do not yet meet our mutual 
expectations, I mean that they do not yet fully correspond to 
the great potential for cooperation which is worthy of our 
countries. 
  My visit to Russia should serve as a boost to relations 
between the new Russia and the new Republic of Korea. We have 
accumulated healthy experience. Our cooperation will develop 
further on the basis of this experience and our mutual interests. 
  [Golembiovskiy] Your predecessor, President Roh Tae-Woo, 
promised Moscow a loan of $3 billion, of which our country 
received only half. Now the question of returning this $1.5 
billion has arisen; moreover, the Republic of Korea refuses to 
accept anything Moscow offers in payment for this debt -- from 
raw materials to arms. The impression arises that Seoul is not 
very committed to trade and economic relations with Russia. Is 
this so? 
  [Kim] The loan was frozen because the major part of the debt 
had not been paid. Bilateral relations are now under way at a 
working level; moreover, all proposals put forward by the 
Russian side are discussed. I believe that we will be able to 
resolve this problem. 
  Your words about the ROK's lack of interest in trade and 
economic relations with Russia are evidently connected with the 
fact that you do not have an exact idea of how our relations are 
developing. Once again I will repeat that our cooperation with 
Russia in the economic sphere is developing very dynamically. 
  Russia is a country with great economic potential, the basis 
of which is constituted by its fundamental science and advanced 
high technology, its rich natural resources, and its high level 
of public education. The development of economic relations 
between the two countries on the basis of our economies' 
complementing one another will proceed more quickly if we manage 
to combine with Russia's potential our industrial technology and 
our experience of working in the international market. 
  At the same time, investments and trade depend mainly on how 
mutually profitable our direct links with individual countries 
become. Hence the two countries' governments must work on 
expanding and consolidating the legal and structural base in 
order to exclude difficulties and obstacles in the activity of 
Korean and Russian entrepreneurs alike. 
  Many South Korean entrepreneurs are already working in the 
Russian market, and I hope that my visit to Russia will help to 
create favorable conditions for more energetic activity on their 
part. 
  [Golembiovskiy] The absence of international monitoring of 
North Korea's nuclear installations worries the whole world. Do 
you not think nevertheless that talk of the possibility of war 
and any kind of military preparations only aggravate the 
situation? Ultimately there is no precise information regarding 
the existence of nuclear weapons in North Korea, and it is hard 
to imagine its leaders' really wanting a military conflict. 
  [Kim] At the moment there is no precise evidence that the 
DPRK possesses nuclear weapons. However, there are suspicions 
that Pyongyang has long time been developing nuclear weapons and 
is already using a considerable number of nuclear components for 
military purposes. In order to rid the international community 
of these doubts it is necessary to ensure total glasnost 
regarding North Korea's nuclear installations. The DPRK should 
accede to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as quickly as 
possible and ensure that full inspections are carried out in its 
country. 
  The ROK Government and the world community are making every 
effort to resolve the North Korean nuclear problem peacefully if 
possible. However, there is a limit to the world community's 
patience. In the event that North Korea does not renounce its 
plans and continues to develop nuclear weapons, rigorous 
sanctions by the world community will inevitably follow. 
  [Golembiovskiy] Do South Korean diplomats plan to take part 
in the multilateral conference on this subject proposed by the 
Russian Foreign Ministry? 
  [Kim] I would first like to express gratitude to Russia for 
cooperating in tackling the North Korean nuclear problem. The 
International Atomic Energy Agency, South and North Korea, the 
United States, Japan, China, Russia, and other interested 
parties are not only holding bilateral consultations but also 
making efforts in this area on a multilateral basis via the UN 
Security Council. In this connection I think that for the time 
being we should continue to follow the efforts made by the world 
community. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Anna Streltsova report: "Press Conference at the St. </F>
Petersburg FCS. Counterintelligence To Busy Itself With Vetting 
Officials' Incomes"] 
  [Text] The St. Petersburg directorate of the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service [FCS] held a press conference 
devoted to "National Security and Fighting Crime." In it, 
directorate chief Viktor Cherkasov revealed the contents of a 
closed discussion Boris Yeltsin had with FCS chiefs on 26 May. 
It was also intimated at the press conference that several 
draft laws have been prepared by the State Duma providing for a 
stronger control on officials' incomes, something that will be 
done by the FCS among other agencies. 
  As KOMMERSANT-DAILY has already written, following an 
extensive report read out to the FCS staffers Boris Yeltsin held 
a discussion with chiefs of the service whose contents were not 
made public. Viktor Cherkasov briefly expounded its main points 
at yesterday's press conference. In his words, Boris Yeltsin 
assured the FCS chiefs that the large-scale reorganization of 
its subdivisions was basically over, while the investigation 
apparatus as well as special subdivisions to combat crime, which 
are not yet on its payroll, would revert to the FCS. All these 
things are envisioned in the draft of a new law "On The Organs 
of the Russian Federation Counterintelligence Service." 
  According to Mr. Cherkasov, Boris Yeltsin explained to the 
counterintelligence service staff that from now on they will 
also have to work against the special services of the "near 
abroad" countries which have grown more active. The FCS is also 
supposed to supply the top organs of power of Russia with 
information on the current processes in the economy. On the 
basis of this information, the president promised "to take the 
most resolute actions in the sphere of governing the state." 
  Aleksandr Aleksandrov, State Duma deputy elected in St. 
Petersburg and chairman of the Duma national security 
subcommittee, stated at the press conference that "interaction 
in matters of juridical policy" was finally achieved by the 
government and the president. Several draft laws developed by 
the subcommittee aim at improving the material status of 
officials while simultaneously at stepping up the fight against 
abuse of office and graft, for which purpose FCS officers may be 
pressed into service. The authors of the drafts think it 
necessary that all officials should be obliged to declare their 
incomes, while they should be from time to time "vetted as to 
being susceptible to taking bribes," something regarded as a 
provocation by opponents of these innovations. 
  In connection with the president's proposals, some officers 
of the FCS directorate voiced to your KOMMERSANT-DAILY 
correspondent the fear that at this stage the objectives set 
cannot be reached effectively because the repeated 
reorganization of the service did not serve to retain its 
personnel. It is possible, for example, that not all former 
members of the FCS investigation apparatus would want to resume 
their former positions after receiving more attractive offers in 
other subdivisions of the counterintelligence service.

  [Text] Democratic and centrist forces may support a single 
candidate, renowned writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, at the next 
presidential elections in Russia, one of the Democratic Russia 
movement leaders supposed. 
  A co-chairman of Democratic Russia, priest Gleb Yakunin told 
Interfax Wednesday that "all democratic and centrist forces must 
unite to nominate a single candidate for the presidency, 
otherwise a nationwide disaster will happen." 
  In his opinion, such politicians as Yegor Gaydar, Grigoriy 
Yavlinskiy or Sergey Shakhray have very little chance of winning 
the presidential elections in 1996, as all of them are inferior 
to Solzhenitsyn. 
  At the same time, Yakunin said he was concerned and worried 
over some of the statements by Solzhenitsyn who had returned to 
Russia last month after a 20-year exile with respect to the 
national policy and the "Gaydar-Chubays line in the 
implementation of economic reforms." 
  However, Solzhenitsyn's point of view may change as he gets 
to know Russian reality. 
  According to the Russian Constitution, a citizen residing in 
Russia for no fewer than ten years may be elected as president.

<F P=106> [Appeal No. 122-1 RD of the Russian Federation Federal </F>
Assembly State Duma to Ukrainian Supreme Council and Crimean 
Supreme Council Deputies, dated Moscow, 25 May 1994] 
  [Text] Esteemed Colleagues! 
  The State Duma is following with great disquiet and concern 
incoming information regarding the exacerbation of the conflict 
between the Republic of Crimea and Ukrainian central organs. 
  We know from our own experience of building a new Russian 
state how difficult the problems associated with the demarcation 
of powers are. But we also know how futile and destructive are 
attempts forcibly to resolve issues linked with peoples' desire 
for self-determination. 
  The State Duma viewed with hope the announcement of the 
first 
steps toward constructive dialogue and accord taken in Kiev by a 
group of Ukrainian and Crimean Supreme Council deputies. 
  We express confidence that reason will prevail over emotion 
in this dispute both in Kiev and in Simferopol. We hope that 
Ukrainian and Crimean Supreme Council deputies will not allow 
irresponsible politicians to jeopardize people's peace and 
security for their own opportunistic ends. For its part the 
State Duma is ready, with consideration for the delicacy of the 
prevailing situation, to do everything in its power to help seek 
constructive compromises based on the Russian-Ukrainian treaty 
of 19 November 1990. 
  For two centuries the Crimea has served and, we are 
confident, will continue to serve the interests of the fraternal 
peoples of Ukraine and Russia. Once again we call for 
restraint, civic wisdom, and the renunciation of hasty emotional 
actions.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>
  [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] June 1 TASS -- "By prolonging 
the state of emergency in the Dniester area, the Tiraspol 
leaders have grossly violated the agreement on the peaceful 
settlement of the Dniester conflict, signed by the presidents of 
Russia and Moldavia [Moldova]," co-chairman of the Joint Control 
Commission for promoting stability in the conflict area, First 
Deputy Interior Minister of Moldavia Viktor Katane said here 
today. 
  As earlier reported, president of the unrecognised Dniester 
republic Igor Smirnov has decreed to prolong the state of 
emergency on the left-hand bank of the Dniester beginning from 
June 1. The state of emergency was announced on January 18 to 
prevent the holding of pre-term elections to the Moldavian 
parliament in the Dniester area. 
  According to Katane, the state of emergency envisages the 
toughening of the border regime by the self-styled Dniester 
republic and deployment of additional paramilitary units within 
the safety zone. He described as far-fetched the arguments of 
the Tiraspol authorities that the state of emergency was 
necessary to combat crime in the region.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Mayak Radio Network in Russian at 
1243 GMT on 1 June carries a three-minute telephone link-up with 
Almaty correspondent Viktor Glukhovtsev. 
  Glukhovtsev notes that the Kazakhstan Supreme Council 
session 
scheduled for today did not take place and continues: 
  "This was a surprise, of course. Usually, the Supreme 
Council has worked to schedule and met its timetable in a more 
or less accurate way. And so, going through through the floors 
of the massive building and knocking on the doors of the offices 
where the deputies have settled, I ask the same question: Why? 
  "The answers are most abstract, basically a shrugging of the 
shoulders and opaque hints about this having been prompted by 
the Supreme Council's statement in which deputies voiced no 
confidence in the social, economic and legal policy of the 
government. 
  "One can't speak briefly about the origins of this document. 
I will note only that there has been a drastic fall in 
production in the republic; there is a precipitous fall in the 
rate of exchange of the national currency, and, as a result 
acute impoverishment of the population. And it is for this 
reason that the Supreme Council is giving an unambigously 
negative assessment of the present results of the actions of the 
Council of Ministers which is presented with the serious 
accusation that the government is essentially blocking its 
declared course toward a market economy. 
  "In the view of the Supreme Soviet, this has led to economic 
chaos and in such a situation it isn't difficult to understand 
this reaction of the legislators. They saw, as the only way of 
avoiding a paralysis of power, a dialogue between all its 
branches in order to establish a national program of reforms and 
to form a government capable of fulfilling it. That's what's 
going on. 
  "It's clear that a response from the president, who is the 
legal head of the executive authority and government in the 
republic, should follow such a statement. So far there has been 
no such response, and I think that it is for this reason that 
the plenary session never took place today. 
  "Incidentally, in the office of one of the deputies I 
received, on what we shall call a confidential basis, 
confirmation of this conclusion. 
  "Today, a document has today is being circulated amongst the 
deputies on behalf of a number of deputies' groups and factions 
which says, I quote: After the adoption of the statement, the 
coordinating council at its meeting, in violation of the 
provisional statute, postponed the next plenary session, 
allegedly on the grounds of its lack of preparation. We 
consider this to be an attempt to repudiate the busineslike 
spirit of the statement and to turn it into an empty, 
non-binding declaration. And it appears that the hope has not 
been lost to turn the Supreme Council into an obedient tool of 
executive authority and into an administrative and legal 
department attached to the cabinet of ministers and the 
president. End quote."

  [Text] A curfew has been introduced throughout the Chechen 
Republic from today by presidential decree. Groznyy says that 
the reason for this decision is that Russia has extended the 
state of emergency zone in Ingushetia and North Osetia to cover 
regions which are directly adjacent to Chechnya. 
  Russia has not yet officially proposed holding summit talks 
with the Chechen Republic. The only knowledge we have of a 
possible meeting between Boris Yeltin and Dzhokar Dudayev is 
what we have read in the press. This was stated to our radio 
station by Chechnya's Deputy Prime Minister Mayrabek Mugadayev. 
He stressed that Groznyy does not even know who precisely in 
Moscow is engaged in preparing the summit talks. And any other 
talks, at government or Foreign Ministry level, will not do any 
good, Mugadayev considers. The Russian prime minister also 
agrees with this point of view. 
  [Begin Mugadayev recording] Viktor Stepanovich 
[Chernomyrdin] 
told me straight: He said he approved all seven points or 
questions which we put forward and the draft agreement which I 
showed him. It is necessary for Presidents Yeltsin and Dudayev 
to resolve the political aspect of the question. One can regard 
the government-level talks as having been completed since the 
governments have no complaints against each other. [end 
recording] 
  [Announcer] And here is another report from Groznyy. Dzhokar 
Dudayev today stated that the Russian special services are 
preparing a plan to organize a local nuclear explosion in 
Chechnya. Representatives of Russia's foreign intellignece 
service have denied this report.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov has forwarded a 
letter to the UN secretary general and the chairman of the UN 
Security Council to inform them of the Armenian Armed Forces' 
banditry attack on the [name indistinct] locality in Nakhichevan 
Autonomous Republic's Sharurskiy Rayon on 27 May. Nine 
Azerbaijani troops were wounded and four others were killed in 
the incident. 
  Gasan Gasanov described the Armenian Armed Forces' attack as 
an act of banditry. He said: The military operation has taken 
place in a locality which is very far from Daghlyk Karabakh. It 
occurred while Azerbaijan strictly adheres to the agreement on 
the imposition of a cease-fire. Consequently, it conflicts with 
the talks that are held within the CSCE framework, in which 
resolutions are drawn up and adopted for a political solution to 
the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 
  Gasan Gasanov urged the UN, the CSCE, and other 
international 
organizations to condemn the Armenian militarists' aggressive 
activities and take measures to obstruct Armenia's aggression 
against Azerbaijan.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Correspondents </F>
Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] Azeri leader Geydar Aliyev is considering tough 
measures little short of dissolving parliament and imposing 
presidential rule to try to overcome the current political 
crisis, presidential sources told INTERFAX. 
  INTERFAX Note: There has been a string of publications and 
radio and television broadcasts in which calls were made, mainly 
on behalf of Azeri refugees, for dissolving parliament and 
clamping presidential rule in the country. 
  However, administration officials deny such a scenario of 
events. Presidential spokesman Salakhaddin Guliyev told INTERFAX 
that Aliyev had no intention of resorting to any drastic 
decisions concerning parliament or the internal situation as a 
whole in the near future. 
  Many say Aliyev seems to be favoring a more measured 
approach 
based on recommendations from government adviser Arif Ragimzade 
for the time being. Ragimzade proposes that mandates be 
withdrawn from radical opponents of the ruling regime including 
former foreign minister Tofig Gasymov and one of the leaders of 
the National Front Ibragim Ibragimli. Both of them were behind 
a recent protest against the government decision to sign an 
agreement on cease-fire in Nagorno-Karabakh during a meeting in 
Bishkek. Opposition members say Speaker of Parliament Rasul 
Giliyev's signature does in fact put a seal on recognizing the 
enclave as a party in the conflict. 
  Gasymov and Ibragimli were both expelled from parliament by 
a 
majority vote late on Tuesday [31 May]. 
  In a statement afterwards, Gasymov accused the government of 
wanting to get rid of the opposition in parliament and the 
society. 
  For his part, Ibragimli said that Azerbaijan was firmly on 
course towards "dictatorship and a military-police regime" 
predicting hard times ahead and inevitable social unrest. 
  Opposition experts predict the onset of authoritarian trends 
in Aliyev's rule following the expulsion of his staunch 
opponents from parliament. This view was also echoed by leader 
of the National Independence Party Etibar Mamedov who described 
the parliament's decision as destabilizing. He said "the 
parliament's actions indicate that there are forces who want to 
derail oil contracts with the West and help introduce Russian 
troops into Azerbaijan."

<F P=106> [Report by Elchzhi Suleyman and Farid Arifoglu: "Crisis </F>
Overcome"] 
  [Text] The National Assembly got down to business on 23 
May. The sitting was brief--approximately two hours. The main 
topic was the absence of a quorum and the search for a way out 
of the parliamentary crisis. We recall that 15 deputies had 
walked out of the last sitting of the National Assembly, 
protesting the exclusion from the agenda of the question of the 
Bishkek Protocol, and that it has not been possible to muster a 
quorum since--34 votes (theoretically they could have been 
mustered--were the hajji faithful to have returned from Mecca, 
were the sick to have gotten up from their hospital beds...). 
  As moved by R. Guliyev, three options of a way out of the 
parliamentary crisis were discussed. The first presupposes, in 
the speaker's words, "recognition of their responsibility by 
some of the deputies who walked out and their return to perform 
their duty." An appeal to the president that the latter, by 
edict, lower the quorum to 26 votes was the second option, which 
the deputies found more attractive than the others. The last 
option was the dissolution of parliament by edict of the head of 
state. 
  According to the information presented by S. Mirzoyev, 
Supreme Council Secretariat general secretary, there are in the 
constitution lacunae in this sphere: It does not contain 
mechanisms for a way out of such situations. In similar 
instances in world practice the president avails himself of his 
right to dissolve parliament. S. Mirzoyev himself considers the 
second the optimum option. "It is not entirely legitimate, it is 
true, but it is the most acceptable way," he observed. 
  Some 28 deputies of the 30 present voted for the second 
option--an appeal to the president. Two members of the National 
Assembly--Suret Guseynov and Mirgamza Efendiyev--did not take 
part in the vote. S. Guseynov had earlier moved that the speaker 
enter into negotiations with the opposition deputies in order to 
bring them back to the meeting hall. 
  On 25 May the National Assembly once again acquired a 
quorum. 
The 15 deputies who had walked out in the past week returned. T. 
Gasymov delivered a statement on their behalf. He described the 
walkout of the group of deputies as an entirely normal 
occurrence in parliamentary practice in keeping with 
constitutional provisions, the Status of the Deputy Act, and the 
National Assembly standing orders. 
  "But a campaign of slander was mounted against us in the 
news 
media: The opposition is allegedly opposed to an end to the war, 
is sabotaging the work of parliament, and is preventing a pay 
raise for the working people," T. Gasymov continued. "We 
emphatically reject these attacks and, not wishing the needy 
strata of the populace to suffer from an exacerbation of 
relations between the authorities and the opposition, we are 
returning to parliament. We will continue to struggle against 
the commitment of Russian troops to Azerbaijan under the aegis 
of the CIS peacekeeping force. We are opposed to `peace for 
land.' We believe that the Bishkek Protocol is contrary to the 
interests of the Azerbaijani people and demand its discussion in 
parliament," T. Gasymov said. 
  Rasul Guliyev, the head of parliament, viewed T. Gasymov's 
statement as "unobjective." 
  He was followed to the rostrum by Etibar Mamedov. He noted 
the connection between the approach of the deadline for the 
signing of the oil contracts and the exacerbation of the 
domestic political situation and criticized the policy of 
holdups in privatization: "A dangerous trend toward the 
concentration of control over economic potential in the hands of 
three or four persons has emerged." According to E. Mamedov, 
this trend is fraught with negative repercussions. 
  Deputy E. Mamedov then announced his withdrawal from the 
National Assembly until he obtains explanations concerning the 
campaign of persecution on the part of the law enforcement 
authorities and the news media that has been mounted against him 
and members of his party. 
  At an impromptu news conference in the lobby of the Supreme 
Council, Etibar Mamedov declared he had never recognized the 
"irreconcilable opposition" concept. In the opinion of the 
leader of the National Independence Party, the opposition should 
be constructive and open to cooperation. He is, as before, 
opposed to the commitment of Russian troops in any capacity. 
  After this, parliament finally got down to legislative 
activity. The Commodity Exchanges Act was adopted without major 
criticism. 
  After the break, the members of parliament embarked on a 
discussion of the draft budget of the Azerbaijani Republic for 
1994. As Dzhumshud Nuriyev, chairman of the Commission of the 
National Assembly for Control of the Budget, announced, revenue 
in the current year will constitute 138.5 billion manat, 
expenditure, 181.4 billion; a deficit, therefore, of 42.9 
billion, which should constitute approximately 7 percent of the 
gross national product. Dzh. Nuriyev sharply criticized the 
unduly high, in his opinion, appropriations for maintenance of 
the organs of state power and administration, which amount to 
almost 10 percent of budget expenditure. 
  The head of the parliamentary commission sees as the way to 
reduce the budget deficit the adoption and realization of an 
official program of privatization, stabilization of the exchange 
rate of the manat, a flexible monetary policy, and the sale to 
the public of government bonds. 
  Dzh. Nuriyev observed that capital investments would be 
allocated mainly for the development of the oil industry and 
agriculture--sectors in which investments are recouped and 
profits are produced most rapidly. 
  As ascertained in the course of the debate, members of the 
National Assembly were worried particularly by how far measures 
of the social protection of the population had been taken into 
consideration in the draft. Fikret Yusifov, first deputy 
minister of finance, emphasized that the government would not go 
the route of an increase in the minimum wage since this would 
merely signify a further increase in the gap in income between 
the high- and low- income categories of the population, not, in 
fact, improving the position of the latter. According to F. 
Yusifov, work is under way at this time on the formulation of a 
mechanism of a rise in salaries according to grade in order to 
alleviate the position of the strata that are socially the most 
vulnerable. 
  Summing up the sitting, the speaker briefly analyzed the 
country's economic situation and charted ways out of the crisis. 
  The fall in production, the high spending on defense, tax 
evasion on the part of a multitude of commercial and industrial 
facilities, the delay in the reforms--such are the causes of the 
Republic's serious situation. It is essential for overcoming the 
crisis, in R. Guliyev's opinion, to halt the decline and achieve 
a growth of production and find markets for the sale of the 
manufactured product. Only high-quality merchandise, for whose 
production investments are needed, can compete successfully on 
these markets. 
  Internal credit resources and external capital investments 
are the sources of the latter. Internal credit resources are at 
this time down to nothing. Moreover, 200 billion manat of loans 
not backed by real resources have been granted. For the 
formation of internal credit resources it is essential to 
undertake privatization and the formation of stock companies and 
to channel the funds thus obtained into the financing of the 
enterprises. But the results will show through only in 6-12 
months. Until then it is necessary to liberalize export-import 
transactions in order to have earned approximately $500-$600 
million by the year's end. 
  It is necessary to avail ourselves of credit from foreign 
governments and international financial organizations. Credit of 
$1 billion would be sufficient to stabilize the economy and 
create reserves for its continued normal operation. The 
conditions of the allocation of foreign credit are a peaceful 
solution of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict and the signing of 
the oil contracts. Certain progress has been made in both areas. 
Combat operations have been terminated, and a search for ways to 
achieve a big peace agreement is under way. The oil negotiations 
have entered their final phase; the signing of the actual 
document is expected very shortly. 
  The speaker supported the introduction of a progressive tax 
system. Concerning wages, R. Guliyev declared that it was 
expedient to raise them for doctors and teachers and increase 
student grants and retiree benefits. These strata of society (2 
million persons approximately) are among the most vulnerable 
socially. The corresponding presidential edict will appear soon. 
  Terming the proposed draft budget the "optimum version," the 
head of parliament called for its approval. But the deputies, of 
a mind not to hurry, postponed this procedure until the 
following day. 
  On 26 May the National Assembly passed the 1994 Azerbaijan 
Republic Budget Act and the corresponding decree. Parliament 
instructed the Ministry of Economics to present a specific 
program of economic reforms, and the National Bank, guidelines 
of monetary policy for 1994. Two weeks were allotted for both.

<F P=106> [Report by Elchin Suleyman: "Russian Parliamentarians' </F>
Visit"] 
  [Text] "We have to lay our brick in the foundation of 
friendship between the peoples of Azerbaijan and Russia," N. 
Bezborodov, member of the Russian parliamentarians' group and a 
deputy chairman of the State Duma's commission on defense and 
security, said at the meeting with the president of Azerbaijan. 
This group, which represents the Russian Way parliamentary 
faction (leader S. Baburin) has been in Azerbaijan for several 
days and is conducting active work. On the eve of the meeting 
with the president, the group was received by the parliament 
chairman, Rasul Guliyev. The group includes members of the 
clergy, the military, and agrarian economists. Thus, it is not 
surprising that economic issues were raised as well. In 
particular, it was said that the economic potential of our 
countries is not being fully utilized and "as a result, both 
countries lose." Although not too long ago convoys of "gifts of 
nature" were being sent to Moscow without encountering any 
particular obstacles. 
  The guests were also interested in the situation of Russians 
in Azerbaijan; in this connection the president said that after 
the disintegration of the Union certain processes affecting 
people's lives have indeed began. Russia is concerned about 
Russians living in other countries. "Now the Russians live in 
most normal conditions," said the head of state. "If some 
problems do arise in the future, we are capable of dealing with 
them." 
  It was probably the first time that journalists heard from 
the mouth of Russian politicians the thesis of the unconditional 
need for withdrawal of Armenian troops from the occupied 
territories of Azerbaijan; N. Bezborodov made this statement: 
"Armenia must withdraw troops from the occupied territories." 
  Russian parliamentarians agree that the mass media seriously 
distort the situation in the region, "do not deliver objective 
information, and suppress many things." The deputies assured the 
president that the detailed information they have received here 
will be presented to the mass media, to the parliament, and the 
government of Russia--which, actually, was one of the main 
purposes of their visit to Azerbaijan.

  [Text] With the direct participation of the Ministry of 
Finance, a draft presidential edict has been drawn up on a 
package of measures to prevent the growth of inflation in 
Azerbaijan. As Fikret Yusifov, acting minister of finance of 
the Republic, stated to a correspondent of the KHABAR-SERVIS 
agency, the draft specifically envisages a suspension of the 
construction of secondary and tertiary facilities and long-term 
construction projects, as well as the adoption of special 
parallel measures in connection with the coming increase in the 
minimum wage which, in the words of the acting finance minister, 
will have a negative effect on inflationary processes. 
  F. Yusifov declined to give a direct response to the agency 
correspondent's question as to how accurate are the rumors 
concerning anti-inflationary experiments by the directorship of 
the National Bank of Azerbaijan, that the bank flooded the black 
market with a large amount of foreign currency to stabilize the 
exchange rate of the manat. Yusifov noted that such rumors were 
being spread prior to his time as well, but they have not been 
corroborated. He added that the National Bank does not possess 
a large quantity of foreign currency, and that what currency 
exists is concentrated mainly in the International Bank.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates"] 
  [Text] The National Bank of Azerbaijan has sharply changed 
the exchange rates of foreign currency with respect to the 
manat. Now $1 is valued at 1,100 manat. As Abdulla 
Melik-Aslanov, deputy chairman of the board of the National 
Bank, informed a correspondent of the ANS-PRESS agency, the new 
exchange rate is more realistic and acceptable under today's 
critical economic conditions. A. Melik-Aslanov believes the 
increased bank exchange rate will not be accompanied by 
significant changes on the currency black market. He emphasized 
that "more surprises lie in store" with respect to official 
currency exchange rates.

  [Excerpts] Kiev, 1 June -- Leonid Kravchuk, president of 
Ukraine made a speech on the current situation in Crimea at a 
session of the Ukrainian parliament. [passage omitted] 
  Touching on problems of the Black Sea Fleet, Leonid Kravchuk 
noted that there are two tasks which must be tackled first: To 
resolve the problem of the deployment of both fleets at various 
bases and to clearly define the status of the Russian fleet 
which is based on Ukrainian territory. The problem of the Black 
Sea Fleet should, in the president's view, meet Ukraine's 
national interests and should guarantee Russia's security on its 
foreign borders. 
  However, the president considers that in the future the 
Russian fleet should be based exclusively at bases on Russian 
territory. 
  At the end, Leonid Kravchuk stressed that the regulation of 
the "Crimean problem" is of vital importance for Ukraine, 
Crimea, Europe and the world. 
  Leonid Kravchuk answered questions from journalists.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Leonid Kravchuk at a Supreme Council </F>
session in Kiev -- live] 
  [Text] Esteemed people's deputies: In my speech to you, 
to the Supreme Council, I set out the arguments. In analyzing 
the discussions that took place both yesterday and today, it 
seemed to me that the stress was put only on the first argument; 
namely, on the necessity of postponing the elections. But the 
other important argument -- that if the Supreme Council adopts 
the relevant laws and clarifications then the elections should 
be held -- was not analyzed. Therefore, I am not saying from 
this podium that the elections should not be held. I said, and 
I am saying, and I stick to this point of view, that it is 
necessary to hold the elections [applause], but must be held 
only when the elections are subject to a legislative base. This 
is my position and it is based on the fact that otherwise we 
could finally lose control of power. If the elections are held 
without the introduction of amendments and additions to the 
Constitution and laws and if the authorities of oblast and rayon 
chairmen, and so on, are not clearly defined, then we will have 
an uncontrolled situation and we will have a complete collapse 
of the executive authority. 
  I am not threatening you. I am speaking from the experience 
we have had since 1990, and you will recall that we did not 
introduce presidency because of someone's whim but because of 
the situation that developed. 
  Second, if you carefully read the law passed by the previous 
Supreme Council on the formation of national and local state and 
representative bodies, you will not find any mention of 
president there. I remember how your predecessors censored this 
law and how much they were opposed to the institution of 
presidency. Suddenly, today, they say that a president must be 
elected. I am asking you, how? If that law vests everything in 
the government, this being only a probability because no one 
knows what specifically is vested, since it only says that 
specific laws are yet to be worked out, what is the role of the 
president? 
  If the president is popularly elected given these powers -- 
and as far as I can see, there is no alternative -- we will have 
a president in Kiev, who will be the head of state and head of 
executive power, with no tools whatsoever for the president's 
regional influence. That is why I am saying that these issues 
must be settled. 
  If the Supreme Council really wants, as some declared here, 
Ukraine to remain an independent, governed, sovereign, and 
democratic state, then, confirming its decision to hold the 
election on 26 June, it should not make a mere general 
statement, but take a specific responsibility here, in front of 
everyone, to prepare relevant documents before 26 June. This 
must be stated in a resolution. Because the draft resolution 
says: submit before 12 June -- I read on -- documents regulating 
the powers of the president of Ukraine. The powers of the 
Ukrainian president are regulated by the Constitution, and no 
law can change it, no matter how much you may wish. Changes 
must be made in the Constitution. Is there a real possibility of 
making the changes? If there is, let us make them. I am in 
favor of this; moreover, I was the first to stand for a clear 
delimitation of powers, and it was my proposal to write down in 
the draft constitution the delimitation of the president's 
powers as the head of state and the head of executive power. 
But this must be written down in the Constitution. 
  Therefore, I would like you to withdraw the allegations made 
here that someone wants to hold on to his seat, and someone 
wants something else, and questions as to why the president 
signed the law on elections. Yes, the president did sign it, 
but the president has since submitted draft documents to the 
Supreme Council concerning the law on power, and you said here 
from the podium that the law on power was absolutely redundant. 
But it clearly defined what the president does, what the 
government does, what judicial power does, and what the Supreme 
Council does. People would have voted for it on 27 March, and 
then, on this basis, elections would be held. Then there would 
have been no tug-of-war. But you did not want it that way. 
  Now there's another interesting point. They say that you 
need only one change: the chairman of an oblast council should 
be elected by council deputies. Then all will be well. I am 
asking you: If the chairman is elected by council deputies, can 
the central government dismiss him? No. Can the president do 
so? No. I have now three times more powers against the 
president of Crimea then the president elected in June will have 
against an oblast or rayon council chairman. If we are to elect 
a president not just because one does not like the current 
president, as I feel the case is, I would like the president to 
be elected without destroying state and executive power, 
legitimately, consistently, and without saying: Why do we need 
these legal intricacies, the people want elections! Because 
tomorrow, when it is destroyed, the same people will come to the 
Supreme Council and say they are getting no pension, because the 
budget will not receive any contributions, they are not getting 
this, they are not getting that. I ask you, who will answer 
these questions and how? 
  If we are to create new power, in which I support you, let 
us create it in a way to make it work. I repeat: The power we 
will elect now will not work. If it does, there will be no 
control over this power by present law. I don't want to be a 
prophet in my country, as they say, but you will see it for 
yourself in a while. That's why I want us to approach the 
situation in a very responsible way. 
  If the Supreme Council and its commissions undertake to 
amend 
these laws and lay the necessary emphases in the laws passed by 
your predecessors, then there is no doubt that I will support 
the elections. This is my absolutely clear position on local 
elections. 
  Second, my position on the presidential election. The 
president's status today is defined by the Constitution. If the 
president is elected in this status, then, believe me, if he 
endures all the tortures of election, no Supreme Council will 
take away any powers from him. Therefore, any change will have 
to be put to a referendum. Someone here already hinted at a 
referendum, that we must hold one to see what is necessary and 
what is not. This is a curious line of argument, electing a 
president with all his powers in June, and holding a referendum 
in September to see if there is any need for him at all. What 
powers can you then taken away from him? 
  I ask you, what are we after? Just to pass on slogans? I am 
appealing to you: you will have the greatest responsibility, and 
I want you to know this, because the presidential campaign is 
under way. I am a presidential candidate. You are a popularly 
elected legitimate Supreme Council, a constitutional but not a 
full-blooded one, because one third of deputies are missing. 
Some regions are not represented in the Supreme Council. But 
you are a legitimate, constitutional Supreme Council. You bear 
the greatest responsibility today for the kind of power we will 
form. History must know this, what kind of power we are 
forming. What kind of power it will be is exclusively and fully 
within the competence of the Supreme Council. Any political 
passions, any allegations as to who wants what and how, must be 
dismissed if we indeed are rooting for Ukraine. You can quote 
enough arguments today both for and against. I want us to form 
a strong executive power, a legitimate supreme legislative 
power, and a president with clear and well- defined powers. If 
we do this, and I urge you to do this, then we need to go to the 
polls on 26 June. Whoever wins will win -- I never denied that.

  [Text] Moscow June 2 TASS -- "The time will come when our 
two countries will again return to the Euro-Asian union idea, 
first suggested by Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev, 
notwithstanding the fact that some CIS members are not prepared 
so far to join such a union, State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin said 
here on Thursday during a meeting with Kazakhstan Foreign 
Minister Kanat Saudabayev. 
  "However, it may so happen that by that time the 
legislations 
of our states will become so different from one another that a 
good deal of effort would have to be made to bring them closer 
together again," Rybkin said. 
  In view of this, "it is essential to seek cooperation in the 
lawmaking process within the CIS framework so that the 
legislations of our states would be adequate to one another as 
much is possible", pointed out the speaker of the lower house of 
the Russian parliament.

  [Text] The presidents of the three republics in Central 
Asia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan will hold a [words 
indistinct] During the summit, questions on economic 
cooperation will be examined. Bolat Ahmadgaliyev, from the 
Kazakh president's office, spoke about this to journalists. It 
is known that after the breakdown of the former [Soviet] Union 
the leaders of the Central Asian republics took a number of 
steps to begin cooperation in the economic field and in many 
other fields. The difficulties of transferring to a market 
economy, leaving the problems of monetary unity in the republics 
untackled, the breakdown of economic ties, and other reasons 
hindered the process of economic cooperation between the Central 
Asian republics from fully forging ahead. 
  The situation has now changed. The problems in the process 
of development are now clear. If Uzbekistan is to introduce its 
own national currency in July then another possibility will be 
found. The cooperation now taking shape between the republics of 
Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan must be expanded. The 
meetings between the leaders of the three republics have started 
to show results, particularly in the economic field. 
  At their scheduled summit meeting the presidents of the 
three 
countries will examine the possibilities of expanding 
cooperation in the agro-industrial field and providing for 
capital and labor forces.

situation in all three Baltic countries. 
  It stated that the lowest inflation in April was in 
Lithuania 
-- 1.6 percent -- and the highest in Estonia -- 3.1 percent; 
inflation in Latvia was 2.7 percent. But throughout the whole 
of last year, from April 1993 to April 1994, the lowest 
inflation was in Latvia -- 37.4 percent -- and the highest in 
Lithuania -- 78.5 percent. 
  Fewer industrial products were sold in April than in March 
in 
all three states: in Lithuania, 17 percent less, in Latvia, 15.9 
percent less, and in Estonia -- 14.3 percent less. 
  Between April 1993 and April 1994, industrial output 
declined 
in Lithuania by 43.6 percent, and in Latvia by 18.8 percent; 
there is no information about this from Estonia, ELTA 
[Lithuanian News Agency] reports. 
  The highest unemployment in April was in Latvia -- 6.6 
percent; unemployment in Lithuania was 3.6 percent, and in 
Estonia 2.3 percent.

  [Text] Moscow June 3 TASS -- ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, referring 
to reliable sources, report an intention of the Russian 
government to raise the minimum wage index by 40 percent from 
July 1. Minimum wage will thus grow from 14,620 to 20,500 
roubles. The same indexation coefficient will be applied to the 
recalculation of wages in the budget-supported branches of the 
economy. 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI reports a statement by Russian 
Vice-Premier 
Yuriy Yarov that mass unemployment in the country threatens with 
such a social outburst in comparison with which "the 
consequences of hyperinflation would pale into insignificance". 
If ways to resolve the problem are not found now, "the 
situation will run out of control soon," he maintains. 
  RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA carries a series of articles about a 
Bogychany hydropower station which has been under construction 
on Angara River since 1976. It follows from an article by First 
Vice-Premier Oleg Soskovets that the hydropower station will be 
a highly effective one because it will operate at the place of 
the Angara discharge regulated by Lake Baykal and Bratsk 
man-made lake and will make it possible to effect a saving of 
more than 5.5 tonnes of scarce organic fuel every year. It is 
essential to take all measures to bring the station into 
operation in 1997, Soskovets writes. 
  TRUD runs an article by Sergey Tsvetkov, chairman of the 
ecological commission of the writers' union of St. Petersburg, 
who urges a cancellation of the Russian governemnt instruction 
to build transportation technology facilities in the gulf of 
Finland. Tsvetkov maintains that an expert conlusion simply 
baffles one with contradictions. "Of course, the development of 
Russia is impossible without harbours, but at what price will 
they be created? And who can prove what will be cheaper -- to 
transport goods via the Baltics or our own ports?" the article 
points out. 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) points out the need to complete 
the construction of a nuclear-powered guided missle cruiser 
Peter the Great. "We need the Peter the Great cruiser to speak 
to the United States, which regards its Navy as `the only one 
dominating the world ocean', on a par, and to prevent a final 
collapse of the Russian Federation's shipbuilding industry. The 
cruiser should be commissioned without fail by the tercentenary 
of the Russian Navy," the newspaper emphasises. 
  The press highlights South Korean President Kim Young-Sam's 
visit to Moscow. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA reports the visit under 
the headlines "The Kremlin Is Prepared To Support Sanctions 
Against the DPRK" and "Russia Needs a United and Non-Nuclear 
Korea". 
  Touching upon President Boris Yeltsin's meeting with his 
South Korean counterpart, the newspaper writes: "The fact that 
Seoul needed such a meeting not less but even more than Moscow 
was confired by the two presidents' talks and by the ensuing 
joint press conference in the Kremlin. South Korea in principle 
received what it wanted from Russia. Notwithstanding tentative 
reservations, Boris Nikolayevich in the end uttered the word 
`sanctions' (against North Korea)". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an interview with Yevgeniy 
Kozhokin, director of the Russian Institute for Strategic 
Studies, who calls for refraining from intellectual extremism. 
Pointing out that the task of the institute is to participate 
in the elaboration of Russia's national security concept, 
Kozhokin examines whether it is worthwhile for Russia to join 
NATO's Partnership for Peace programme, "it seems to me that we 
shall be able to uphold our national interests more effectively 
by accepting, not rejecting, this partnership". 
  PRAVDA runs an article by Viktor Veshnyakov, a deputy to the 
State Duma, who opposes Russia's joining NATO's Partnership for 
Peace programme. This kind of ideas, he believes, "erode the 
collective security treaty which CIS countries concluded in 
1992". Veshnyakov favours the establishment of an effective 
defence union within the CIS framework as "the military basis of 
a Euro-Asian collective security system". He calls for Russia 
to hold arms reduction talks with NATO precisely from these 
positions. 
  PRAVDA carries an article by Gennadiy Zyuganov, a State Duma 
member and chairaman of the central executive committee of the 
Russian Communist Party, who urges "the restoration of genuine 
government by the people as represented by a single system of 
councils of people's deputies". 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, referring to information from a 
general 
staff officer, reports the existence of "a huge underground town 
near Moscow, with several thousand civilians and military people 
working there every day -- state security, interior ministry, 
and army people. The subterranean town is tens of meters below 
ground, sometimes to a depth equalling to a 10-15 storey 
building sometimes. If necessary it is possible to get by 
special trains to practically any point of the capital."

  [Text] Moscow June 2 TASS -- In two years' time, Russia, by 
all appearances, will not prolong the treaty of friendship, 
cooperation and mutual help signed by the former USSR and 
People's Democratic Republic of Korea in 1961 for another five 
years, a high-ranking official quoted Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin as saying at a meeting with South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam. 
  In accordance with generally recognized norms, the treaty 
may 
be denounced at one year's notice, the source quoted Yeltsin as 
saying. 
  The treaty does exist so far. However, Russia interprets its 
first article, which provides for offering North Korea military 
help automatically, if a war breaks out in the Korean peninsula, 
in a somewhat different way. This provision is actually 
ineffective, Yeltsin said.

  [Text] Moscow, June 3 (YONHAP) -- President Boris Yeltsin 
has promised that Moscow will not conclude any pacts of alliance 
with Pyongyang after the Russia-North Korea Friendship, 
Cooperation and Mutual Assistance Treaty expires in two years, 
South Korean President Kim Yong-sam said Friday. 
  Kim disclosed Yeltsin's pledge during a breakfast meeting 
with South Korean correspondents stationed in the Russian 
capital. 
  Yeltsin made it clear that Moscow will neither renew the 
current treaty nor conclude any others of similar nature, Kim 
said. 
  The Russia-North Korea treaty, which has been the ground for 
relations between the two countries, was concluded in 1961 and 
is due to expire at the end of 1996. It will be extended 
automatically for another five years unless either side 
abrogates it. 
  The core part of this treaty, which calls for automatic 
military intervention by Russia in case of war in Korea, has 
practically become "a dead letter," Kim explained. 
  With regard to possible sanctions against North Korea, 
Yeltsin told him that Russia intends to participate when they 
have become inevitable after the U.N. Security Council took 
necessary steps, including repeated issuance of warnings, Kim 
said. 
  Kim said he was informed of "a top secret" by the Russian 
side in connection with problems related to North Korea's 
development of nuclear weapons, but he could not disclose it at 
this stage. 
  The president said Yeltsin also promised to make a decision 
so that Russia would not sell any weapons or parts to North 
Korea under any circumstances. 
  Commenting on the North Korean lumberjacks fleeing from 
Pyongyang-run Siberian logging camps, Kim said he and Yeltsin 
agreed that Seoul could bring as many to South Korea as it 
wishes. 
  Kim said the Seoul government plans to bring home all 
Koreans 
living in Sakhalin if they so desire. 
  On the shooting down of the Korean Air (KAL) 007 jetliner by 
a Soviet fighter plane in 1983, Kim noted that Yeltsin said the 
responsibility lies with the airline. This is the basic 
official Russian position, Kim said. 
  But he said the two countries will hold working-level 
meetings to discuss the problem of compensating the victims' 
families. 
  As for the development of gas fields in the Russian Far 
East, 
Kim said South Korea and Russia will invest 10 million U.S. 
dollars each to undertake a feasibility study.

  [Text] Moscow June 2 TASS -- President Boris Yeltsin of 
Russia and President Kim Yong-sam proclaimed that "relations 
between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Korea develop 
into a constructive mutually complementary partnership based on 
the common values of freedom, democracy, legality, respect for 
human rights and a market economy," said a joint Russo-South 
Korean joint declaration which the two presidents signed at the 
close of summit talks held in the Kremlin on Thursday. 
  The two presidents agreed that success of political and 
economic reforms in Russia would be a substantial factor of 
peace and prosperity in the world as a whole and stability in 
Northeast Asia and the Pacific Ocean area, in particular", the 
declaration said. Mr. Kim assured Boris Yeltsin of South Korea's 
"cooperation and support for reforms which are being effected in 
Russia". 
  The leaders of the two countries decided to give a boost to 
political dialogue at various levels, including meetings between 
the heads of state and government, parliamentary leaders and 
cabinet ministers. They agreed to establish a "hot line" 
between the Kremlin in Moscow and the Blue House in Seoul to 
maintain close contacts between the heads of two states. 
  The two sides agreed to make joint efforts to combine 
Russia's high technologies with the introduction and industrial 
resources of the Republic of Korea and encourage investments in 
co-development of the natural resources of the Russian 
Federation. They came out in support of direct business 
contacts between the Russian Far East and the Republic of Korea. 
  The two presidents were gratified to note a steady growth of 
bilateral trade and agreed to further efforts to strengthen 
legal and organisational principles in such spheres as 
transport, customs, and industrial standards to promote 
bilateral trade and investments. 
  Boris Yeltsin and Mr. Kim agreed on close cooperation 
between 
the two states in tackling global issues. They highly 
appreciated possibilities for dynamic growth in the Asia-Pacific 
region and agreed to join hands to make it a region of peace and 
prosperity. 
  Mr. Kim welcomed Russia's aspiration actively and 
constructively participate in all areas of Pacific Rim 
cooperation and pointed out that the Republic of Korea would 
positivly consider Russia's candidacy for Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) forum membership. 
  The two presidents "called on the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea as a party to the Treaty on Non-Proliferation 
of Nuclear Weapons strictly and consistently fulfil its 
obligations under the treaty and as regards inspection under the 
safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
  Boris Yeltsin, the declaration said, "reaffirmed that 
Russia, 
alongside other states, will continue actively to participate in 
the international community efforts to ensure denuclearisation 
of the Korean Peninsula". 
  President Kim Yong-sam, for his part, "gave a high appraisal 
of Russia's proposal to convene a multilateral conference on 
security and non-nuclear status of the Korean Peninsula." 
  The two leaders agreed that "any attempt to produce nuclear 
weapons on the Korean Peninsula poses a serious threat to peace 
and security not only in Korea but in Northeast Asia and and the 
whole world as well". They agreed to hold bilateral 
consultations on matters of security in Northeast Asia. 
  The two presidents "pointed out the need for a continuation 
of the dialogue between South and North Korea to ease tension, 
to strenthen peace, security and stability, and agreed that the 
unification of Korea should be achieved in a peaceful and 
democratic way, through a direct dialogue between the two sides."

  [Text] Moscow, 2 Jun -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin and 
ROK President Kim Yong-sam "call upon the DPRK, as a signatory 
of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, to strictly and 
consistently fulfil its commitments" under that document, and 
with regard to inspections under the verification agreement with 
the IAEA. This is stated in a Joint Russo-Korean declaration, 
which the leaders of the two countries signed at the end of 
today's summit talks in the Kremlin. 
  Boris Yeltsin, the declaration says, "confirms that Russia, 
alongside other states, will in future also take an active part 
in the efforts of the international community to ensure the 
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula." 
  President Kim Yong-sam, the document points out, "highly 
appraises Russia's proposal on convening a multilateral 
conference on security and the nuclear-free status of the Korean 
Peninsula." 
  The two leaders agree that "any attempt to manufacture 
nuclear weaponry on the Korean Peninsula poses a serious threat 
to peace and security, not only in Korea, but also in Northeast 
Asia and throughout the world."

  [Text] Moscow June 2 TASS -- Korean President Kim Yong-sam 
said on Thursday he is quite convinced that "a very bright 
future lies ahead of us" in Russo-Korean relations. 
  Speaking at a dinner hosted by President Yeltsin, Kim 
Yong-sam noted that "we will surely share a great future 
together if the advanced technology and vast natural resources 
of the Russian Federation are combined with the industrial 
development and business management expertise of Korea." 
  Kim Yong-sam expressed confidence that "great friendship and 
trust" shared by the two presidents, despite their relatively 
brief association, will "serve as a strong catalyst for further 
developing relations between our two nations." 
  The president said he hopes that "the Russian Federation 
will 
actively participate in the Asia-Pacific economic cooperation 
forum." 
  According to him, documents concerning the Korean war of 
1950- 1953 which were handed today to the Korean president by 
Boris Yeltsin "will stand as a symbol of our firm determination 
to make a fresh start in our relations, putting behind us our 
unfortunate past relations during the era of Cold War." 
  Kim Yong-sam expressed gratitude to the Government of the 
Russian Federation for "its positive participation in the 
international movement to block the development of nuclear arms 
by North Korea."

  [Text] Moscow, 2 Jun -- Russia will firmly uphold the 
international nuclear nonproliferation regime, Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin announced today at a state reception in the 
Faceted Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace in honor of South 
Korean President Kim Yong-sam. One of the primary goals of this 
is to guarantee a nonnuclear status for the Korean peninsula, 
the Russian head of state stressed. 
  Yeltsin recalled that Russia has proposed an international 
conference on this issue, which could find a comprehensive 
solution to the nuclear issue, and in particular, bring about 
specific agreements making it possible to reduce and 
subsequently remove the dangerous confrontation on the Korean 
peninsula. The main aim is to begin a movement toward trust and 
cooperation. 
  Moscow is ready to play and will play an active part in 
creating international mechanisms aimed at strengthening a 
climate of trust, security, and cooperation in relations between 
the states of the Asia-Pacific region, the Russian president 
said. 
  Yeltsin expressed confidence that close interaction between 
Russia and the Republic of Korea would help to strengthen 
stability in the Asia-Pacific region. In his words, relations 
with Seoul are one of Moscow's top priorities in the 
Asia-Pacific sphere. 
  Russia, the Russian president pointed out, has historically 
been deeply involved in the affairs of the Korean peninsula. In 
July it will be 110 years since the establishment of relations 
between Russia and Korea. Ties are developing well at the 
present time too. But there is a need to move on and give the 
"green light" to all cooperation projects in all spheres of 
life. This applies first and foremost to the economic sphere, 
the more so since opportunities and reserves do exist for this. 
  Russia wants the speediest possible reunification of Korea 
by 
peaceful democratic means, Yeltsin said. One of the most 
dangerous threats in Asia and throughout the world will thereby 
be eliminated. We want to see Korea as a unified, peace-loving, 
democratic, nuclear-free, and prosperous state and a reliable 
partner of Russia, the president pointed out. I believe that 
the way to achieve this will be found by the Koreans themselves. 
Russia is ready to facilitate the accomplishment of the Korean 
people's cherished goal of unification as soon as possible.

  [Text] Moscow June 2 TASS -- Korean President Kim Yong-sam 
said on Thursday that "it will be impossible to preserve peace 
in northeast Asia without Russian cooperation". The president, 
who is now on a state visit to Russia, was addressing the 
Federation Council (the upper chamber of the Russian parliament). 
  Kim Yong-sam noted that "the cooperation of the leaders of 
the Russian administration and parliament to forge a new era of 
regional peace will also help promote peace throughout the 
world". 
  The president said that through an extensive dialogue with 
President Yeltsin this morning he was convinced that Korea and 
Russia could be "trusted partners in quest of greater shared 
prosperity well into the 21st century". 
  According to the president, both states should cooperate to 
ensure the success of the reform policies now being pursued in 
both lands. 
  Kim Yong-sam expressed hope that his current visit will 
boost 
Russian-Korean cooperation that "will make us even better 
neighbours". He reminded that the two-way trade jumped from 
only 900 million USD in 1990 to 1.6 billion last year. Korea's 
businesses have invested 24 million USD in 25 development 
projects in Russia, and as of March 1994, 29 major Korean 
companies had established branch offices in Russia. 
  Touching upon the situation on the Korean peninsula, the 
president noted that "it is imperative to resolve international 
suspicions about North Korea's nuclear development programme as 
quickly as possible" adding that "without a decisive solution of 
the nuclear issue, it will be impossible to preserve peace not 
only on the Korean peninsula but also in Asia as a whole". 
  "If and when the nuclear issue is settled, the Republic of 
Korea is ready and willing to provide economic support to North 
Korea to help it rebuild its tattered economy and carry out 
reform", Kim Yong-sam stressed. 
  The president appealed to members of the Russian parliament 
to actively cooperate to solve the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  The president cited well-known verses by Russian poet Fedor 
Tyutchev: "Russia cannot be grasped by reason... It can only be 
trusted". Emphasizing the last line of the poem, the president 
said that he trusted that "the rise of a stable and prosperous 
new Russia will signal the beginning of a new era of universal 
prosperity of not only the Russian people themselves but also of 
all Asians and all mankind".

  [Text] Moscow June 2 TASS -- South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam said his country can render economic aid to North Korea 
if the latter allows nuclear inspections on its territory. 
  Addressing Russian lawmakers on Thursday he said that, 
proceeding from the principle of national co-flourishment, South 
Korea will develop the policy of active cooperation with 
Pyongyang. Seoul is also ready to promote better relations 
between North Korea, the United States and Japan, according to 
the president. 
  Kim Yong-sam said that he had discussed with the Russian 
president bilateral relations in full volume, including the 
issue of making "North Korea refrain from developing nuclear 
weapons". 
  State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin said that Russia understands 
the wish of the Korean people "to reunite into a single and 
flourishing state in the Far East". Russia is ready to promote 
the reunification, he added.

  [Text] Moscow, June 1 (YONHAP) -- South Korean President 
Kim Yong-sam said Wednesday that after the North Korean nuclear 
dispute is settled, Seoul is willing to provide economic support 
to Pyongyang. 
  Kim, currently visiting Russia, made the remark while 
delivering an address to the Council of the Russian Federation. 
  "If and when the nuclear issue is settled, the Republic of 
Korea is ready and willing to provide economic support to North 
Korea to help it rebuild its shattered economy and carry out 
reform," he said. 
  Kim arrived in Moscow on Wednesday and has held two summit 
meetings with Russian President Boris Yeltsin. 
  "... It is imperative to resolve international suspicions 
about North Korea's nuclear development program as quickly as 
possible. Without a decisive solution to the nuclear issue, it 
will be impossible to preserve peace not only on the Korean 
peninsula but also in Asia as a whole." 
  He added, "I sincerely appeal to you, distinguished members 
of the Federation Council, to actively cooperate in solving this 
issue." 
  The president also emphasized that Russia and Korea will be 
able to work together in ushering in the fledgling Asia-Pacific 
era. 
  "It will be impossible to preserve peace in Northeast Asia 
without Russian cooperation. This is the very basis for the 
joint efforts of our two countries to advance shared prosperity."

  [Text] Moscow, 2 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- Asked by an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent about the Russian initiative on convening an 
international conference on security and a nuclear-free status 
for the Korean Peninsula, Russian President Boris Yeltsin said 
that the Russian and Korean leaders "are greatly concerned at 
what is going on in North Korea, considering how close it is to 
Russia's eastern borders." He was speaking at a joint news 
conference of the Russian and South Korean presidents today, 
  "We cannot look with indifference at North Korea's attitude 
toward the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, signed earlier, and 
we are prepared to take every action," the Russian president 
said. At the same time, he said that the issue "is dragging on 
and there is still no positive solution." 
  Boris Yeltsin said that "if the opportunity presents itself, 
this question will be discussed with U.S. President Bill 
Clinton." 
  The Russian president believes that it is premature to speak 
about sanctions against North Korea, as no decision has yet been 
made on convening an international conference on North Korea's 
nuclear problem. However, he said, "if North Korea tries to 
cancel the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Russia will be 
forced to tackle this problem stage by stage. It would first 
have to issue a warning, and then the world community would have 
to take sanctions in relation to North Korea." 
  Regarding the 1961 Treaty with North Korea on friendship, 
cooperation, and mutual aid, Boris Yeltsin reminded that an 
amendment has been made to the first artcile of the Treaty. "It 
contains no rigid statement regarding the fact that we are 
helping and taking the side of North Korea," The Russian 
president stressed. 
  Boris Yeltsin admitted that the Russian debt to South Korea 
now totals 1,400 million US Dollars. President Boris Yeltsin 
admitted that the Russian debt to South Korea impedes bilateral 
economic cooperation, but nevertheless called on Korean 
businessmen to invest in the Russian Far East. 
  Russia owes South Korea $1.4 billion, and $400 million are 
overdue debts. 
  "This serious problem impedes the development of major 
projects between the two states", yeltsin said at the news 
conference, citing the construction of a gas pipeline from the 
Siberian Republic of Yakutia to Korea as an example. Other 
major projects include the development of the Far Eastern port 
of Nakhodka and the construction of a trade center in Moscow. 
It is important for us that the South Korean president has 
shown undertanding with regard to rescheduling the debt, Boris 
Yeltsin stressed. 
  Asked whether Russia intends to take upon itself to pay out 
compensation to the victims of the Boeing shot down over Russian 
territory, Boris Yeltsin said that this tragedy occurred during 
the cold war, and "is complicated by a number of circumstances." 
He said that the documents on that prblem have been handed over 
by the Russian side to the international commission, which 
concluded that "the primary party to blame was the crew of the 
KAL airline company, which must accept responsibility." 
  Regarding the problem of North Korean workers in Russia, 
Boris Yeltsin said that "every foreigner on our territory has 
the right to leave Russia if he so desires." 
  Touching on the nuclear problem with regard to the DPRK, 
President Kim Yong-sam stated during the joint news conference 
with the Russian president that the leaders of the two states 
agree on "the need for complete transparency" with regard to 
suspicions that the DPRK is developing nuclear weapons. Both 
presidents, Kim Yong- sam noted, agree to maintain constant 
contact with one another on this problem, with the aid of a 
special telephone line. 
  Kim Yong-sam told correspondents that he has invited Boris 
Yeltsin to visit the Republic of Korea in the near future. The 
dates of the visit, he said, would be agreed by diplomatic 
channels. 
  Kim Yong-sam attaches "historic significance" to the fact 
that Boris Yeltsin has given him archive documents connected 
with the war in Korea between 1950 and 1953. The ROK president 
stated that he is extremely satisfied with his visit to Russia 
and said he has favorable impressions of Moscow and the 
capital's residents, in connection with the changes being 
brought about by the reforms.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel Network in Russian at 1745 GMT on 2 June carries a 
14-minute report by an unidentified announcer on a news 
conference given by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and South 
Korean President Kim Yong-sam. The report begins with historic 
background information on Russia's diplomatic and trade links 
with South Korea. Russia's and South Korea's views on the 
partnership between the two countries are outlined and a video 
showing the two presidents signing documents is shown. 
  Yeltsin is then shown speaking at the news conference: "We 
saw our task not so much in summing up what has already been 
done, but in establishing firm prospects for further 
cooperation. We wanted to make sure that the breakthrough we 
made in 1992 will not lose its momentum, that our ties will 
continue to strengthen, and agreements reached in principle will 
each day be filled with new concrete actions. President Kim 
Yong-sam and I have signed the new Moscow Declaration. In our 
opinion, this is a major political document aimed at the future. 
  "After the treaty on the principles of bilateral relations 
signed in Seoul in November 1992 this declaration represents a 
new step forward in the course of our mutually beneficial 
cooperation. The agreement to introduce regular exchange visits 
of young people as from next year is also aimed at the future. 
This will enable our peoples to know each other better. 
  "We have repeatedly stated that we are interested in full- 
blooded economic ties and would like to see investments by South 
Korean firms into our economy increasing, especially in the Far 
East. The active participation of companies from the Republic 
of Korea in conversion of our defense industry could also be of 
mutual benefit. We have arrived at a good level of 
understanding in regard to these issues." 
  Having spoken on economic relations between Russia and South 
Korea, Yeltsin then moves on to the issue of North Korea: 
  "We paid considerable attention to examining the situation 
on 
the Korean Peninsula in the context of nuclear nonproliferation. 
Russia is greatly concerned by the uncontrollability of the 
nuclear issue in that region and fundamentally believes that the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea should remain a full 
participant in the Treaty on Nuclear Nonproliferation and carry 
out in full its obligations under the monitoring agreement of 
the IAEA. That is our main policy. 
  "At the same time, we believe that political methods should 
be used to solve the North Korean nuclear problem and the laws 
and interests of all interested parties should not be infringed. 
One of the ways to implement this is the Russian proposal for 
an international conference on security and the nonnuclear 
status of the Korean Peninsula to be attended by Russia, both 
the Korean states, the United States, China, and Japan, as well 
UN and IAEA representatives. 
  "During the talks we also touched on the issue of the 
100,000 
ethnic Korean Russian citizens living in Russia. Our party 
stressed that Russia's Koreans, like all other Russians in our 
multi-ethnic country, have the right to state support in 
preserving their culture, language, and customs and in the 
development of links with their historical homeland. We have 
every reason for optimism in assessing the prospects of our 
relations with the Republic of Korea. We see them as a 
relationship of constructive good-neighborliness." 
  The announcer then says that questions connected with the 
possible nonnuclear status of the Korean Peninsula were at the 
center of attention during the news conference. 
  Yeltsin says: "We, the two presidents, are very concerned 
about what is happening in the People's Democratic Republic of 
Korea because it directly borders with Russia. Therefore, we 
cannot be indifferent to the way the DPRK regards the treaties 
on nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, and are prepared to act 
accordingly. At first, the United States was dealing with this 
matter, but the question dragged on, and so far no positive 
solution has been found. We will try to talk to U.S. President 
Clinton today, if we can reach him--he is on official visit at 
the moment. After all, we propose that the international 
community should use its influence in solving this question. In 
other words, it should be discussed between Russia, the two 
Koreas, the United States, Japan, China, the United Nations, and 
the IAEA. We should all meet at a summit and solve this problem 
accordingly. I think this is the only way to solve this 
problem. I should say that Mr. Kim Yong-sam has agreed in 
principle with this proposal." 
  The announcer goes on to say that, at one point, Yeltsin 
answered a question from a South Korean journalist about whether 
Russia might impose sanctions against North Korea and, in 
general, what Russia's position was, given that the treaty of 
mutual assistance between Russia and North Korea was still in 
force. 
  Yeltsin says: "Today, when the decision has not yet been 
made to convene an international conference on the problem, as 
it were, the nuclear problem of the DPRK, it is just a bit too 
early to speak straight away about sanctions. But, in 
principle, if matters reach a point where the DPRK digs in its 
heels and refuses to sign, as it were, or rather to annul the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, bearing in mind the nearness of 
our shores, which constitutes a danger to Russia and to our 
population, we will be obliged, gradually, of course, firstly to 
warn, and later, probably, the world community will have to 
adopt, may also adopt some kind of sanctions. 
  "As for war and the 1961 Treaty, an amendment to Article One 
was made in 1990 whereby there is no longer any rigid 
stipulation about our helping or siding with the DPRK." 
  Yeltsin is then asked by a Mayak Radio correspondent if he 
discussed Russia's debt to South Korea during his talks with 
Kim. Yeltsin replies: "Yes, of course we discussed the issue. 
The debt is equal to almost 1.4 billion dollars, 400 million of 
that sum is outstanding debt. This is a serious problem that is 
hampering the development and implementation of the major 
projects that already exist between us, and a special consortium 
has been set up to advance these projects, such as a 
Yakutiya-Korea gas pipe or the development of the port of 
Nakhodka, or the construction of a trade center in Moscow and, 
well, a lot of other projects and objectives of this kind. 
  "During the discussions, I for one was given to understand 
that the president of Korea was sympathetic toward the issue of 
postponing the debt, the start of the cancellation of the debt. 
That is important for us." 
  To the question of whether Russia is considering paying a 
compensation for the victims of the Korean Airlines airliner 
shot down in 1983, Yeltsin says: "This tragedy occurred during 
the Cold War period and was caused by a combination of a number 
of circumstances. We handed over all the relevant documents and 
the international commission that was set up to study all the 
aspects of this tragedy found that, after all, the crew of the 
KAL company was at fault. They should bear the responsibility." 
  The announcer then says that Kim Yong-sam spoke about the 
results of his visit to Moscow, and said that this was very 
useful. Kim Yong-sam is quoted as saying: I believe that in the 
course of my visit and my talks with Mr. Yeltsin we discovered 
new approaches toward the positive and substantial development 
of our relations. The further development of our relations will 
undoubtedly help the peace process in Asia and in the rest of 
the world. 
  Yeltsin is then shown summing up the news conference and 
says: "I believe the most important thing is the spirit in which 
our discussions were held. They were held on the basis and in 
the spirit of friendship, mutual understanding, cooperation, 
partnership, and personal liking for each other--which is very 
important. The fact that just in one year our trade turnover 
with South Korea has doubled means that our peoples and our 
leaders have enormous reserves for developing cooperation 
exactly on this basis. Thank you."

  [Text] Moscow, 2 June -- The visit of the head of the 
Republic of Korea is symbolic, "because it is taking place at a 
time when our countries are in the midst of socio-economic 
transformations and the break-up of out-dated systems and 
patterns of social development," State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin 
said after his meeting with ROK President Kim Yong-sam at the 
President Hotel today. 
  The chairman of the State Duma hoped that multi-faceted ties 
will develop between the Republic of Korea and Russia and that 
contacts between their supreme legislative bodies--the Federal 
Assembly of Russia and the National Assembly of the Republic of 
Korea--play a proper part in this. 
  In reply Kim Yong-sam said he was delighted to meet the 
leaders of a parliament that was elected in free elections for 
the first time in Russia. 
  He expressed gratitude to the State Duma for its adoption of 
a legislative act rehabilitating repressed Koreans in Russia and 
touched on the problems of nuclear disarmament on the Korean 
peninsula and Russia's participation in the Asian-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation program. 
  The Korean president expressed the hope that his "visit will 
serve as a stimulus for shifting our bilateral relations onto a 
qualitatively new and higher level of constructive and mutually 
complementary partnership."

  [Text] Moscow, June 3 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and Russia 
agreed Thursday to jointly develop a natural gas field in 
Yakutia Autonomous Republic in eastern Siberia to supply gas 
through a pipeline to Seoul. 
  President Kim Yong-sam, visiting Moscow until Saturday, and 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin agreed to invest 10 million U.S. 
dollars apiece in a year-long feasibility study of the project 
at their expanded summit meeting, a senior member of Kim's 
entourage said. The project, costing 15-20 billion dollars in 
total, will include development of gas fields and construction 
of a pipeline connecting Yakutsk, Khabarovsk and Wonsan in North 
Korea to Seoul -- and further to Japan if things go well, he 
said. 
  The two governments signed an agreement to develop the Yakut 
gas field in 1992, but could not narrow their differences on the 
project's details. "But President Yeltsin proposed that each 
country invest 10 million dollars this time, so the agreement 
could be reached," he said. 
  He added, "It may take one or two years to decide if the 
field is worth developing, and if it is worth it, the two 
countries will have to further study the field's feasibility 
more closely for another two years." If all goes well, he added, 
the two nations will be able to start the project in 1998. 
  Eleven South Korean companies including Korea Petroleum 
Development Corp., Daewoo, Samsung and Yukong Ltd. have already 
formed a consortium, while Russia and Yakutia have set up their 
own consortiums. 
  "In addition to promoting the economies of the two 
countries, 
the project may contribute to forming a basis for unification of 
the two Koreas since the pipeline goes through North Korea to 
the South," he said. 
  Seoul and Moscow plan to discuss securing the development 
rights to the gas field, whose estimated deposits come to 590 
million tons, and consult with North Korea on construction of 
the pipeline. 
  Meanwhile, Kim and Yeltsin also agreed to push for other 
projects that help promote South Korean investment in Russia 
such as construction of a trade center in Moscow, designation of 
a wharf for exclusive use by South Korean ships, construction of 
a bonded factory and preparation of an industrial complex for 
South Korean businesses. 
  The two countries inaugurated three research and development 
centers in Moscow to promote bilateral technological cooperation 
and commemorate President Kim's visit to the Russian capital.

  [Text] Moscow June 2 TASS -- Russia should mount pressure 
on North Korea to observe the nuclear non-proliferation regime, 
according to Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the State Duma 
Committee on International Affairs, who, however, did not say 
directly whether sanctions should be imposed on Pyongyang. 
  "Our attitude to the problem of nuclear armaments of any 
state is resolutely negative. Surely, it is better to reach an 
agreement than impose sanctions, but the non-proliferation 
regime should be maintained very strictly", he told TASS on 
Thursday. 
  Lukin, who participated in Russian-South Korean talks on 
Thursday, said that "Russia is especially not interested in the 
appearance of new nuclear states on its borders" and added that 
it is necessary to hold a dialogue with Pyongyang when possible. 
  If the dialogue fails "then those countries which do not 
want 
to abide by international and even their own decisions should be 
convinced more resolutely", he said.

  [Text] Moscow June 2 TASS -- Commander of the air force 
branch of the Chinese People's Army, Colonel-General Cao 
Shuangming, is scheduled to begin a ten-day official visit to 
Russia on Thursday, ITAR-TASS was told by the Russian air force 
press centre. The general should arrive in the evening, at 
20:00 Moscow time. 
  The Chinese commander's itinerary for Friday includes laying 
a wreath at the monument to the unknown soldier and visits to 
the aviation technology demonstration center in Kubinka (south 
of Moscow) and to the victory day memorial on Poklonnaya Hill. 
Later in his visit, Cao Shuangming plans to visit the Gagarin 
air force academy and the Sukhoi experimental design bureau. 
The Chinese commander will visit Volgograd and St. Petersburg 
in addition to spending two days in the Black Sea resort of 
Sochi, where the Russian air force has an exclusive resort. 
  Military experts say that Russia's and China's military 
departments have normal business-like ties. They have an 
agreement on cooperation, which aims to ensure the security of 
the two countries and strengthen peace in the Asia-Pacific 
region. 
  The document, in particular, envisages mutual visits, 
including by the commanding staff. This April, head of the 
General Staff of the Russian army, Colonel-General Mikhail 
Kolesnikov, went to China on an official visit. It is envisaged 
that, by the end of 1994, seven Chinese military delegations of 
different levels will have visited Russia. 
  The Chinese military is especially interested in Russian 
aerospace technology. Russia recently sold China some Su-27 
fighter planes, and additional shipments are under 
consideration. China is interested in obtaining a license to 
produce the Su-27, and has initiated negotiations on what 
conditions such a deal should include.

  [From the "Vesti" newscast; Kokoshkin remarks recorded 
throughout] 
  [Text] [Video shows Chernomyrdin visit to China] First 
Deputy 
Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin, who has just been with 
Chernomyrdin in China, has continued to strengthen our military 
contacts, to expand the exchange of servicemen and vessels 
which, he said, aroused no suspicion on the part of our common 
good friend, India. Military-technical cooperation with Beijing 
is based on the fact that Chinese combat equipment is originally 
based on our weapons. 
  [Kokoshin] They are seen by the Chinese army and the Chinese 
navy as the most suitable for them to produce. 
  [Peslyak] There is a world-wide struggle for the armaments 
market but the Chinese side itself wants to develop, for 
example, combat aircraft construction on the basis of Russian 
achievements, starting from small beginnings. 
  [Kokoshin] At this stage it is a question of, specifically, 
supplying a batch of SU-27s. 
  [Peslyak] Kokoshin said that at present the development of 
not only Russia's military but also its civilian technologies is 
being paid for from the defense budget, not to mention that this 
expenditure is to a large extent social expenditure since it 
provides for closed military and scientific townlets. 
  [Kokoshin] Today expenditure on defense research and 
development is money being spent on strengthening Russia's 
position in the world economy.

June, the bank's President Du Wanyu reported to the Financial 
Information Agency in Moscow. 
  He indicated that Russian bankers easily establish contacts 
because the interest rate on credits is relatively low. 
However, he did not mention its amount. 
  Since 1994 the Bank of China in Moscow has granted credits 
to 
its Russian partners amounting to one million dollars. 
  According to Du Wan You, China's financial circles 
attentively follow the political situation in Russia and he sees 
his major task in expansion of trade relations between two 
countries. Du Wan You's assessment of the prospects of the 
liberalization of the access of the foreign banks to Russia was 
rather restrained. He believes that it is necessary to first 
examine all the nuances of Russian banking legislation. 
  Viktor Gerashchenko, Chairman of the Central Bank of Russia, 
reported early this week that Russian President Boris Yeltsin is 
expected to sign a decree on the activity of foreign banks on 
the territory of the Russian Federation before June 8, 1994. 
  Bank of China in Moscow is a joint stock commercial bank 
with 
an authorized capital totalling 10 million dollars, it was 
founded as China's foreign branch bank. The Bank has received a 
general licence of the Central Bank of Russia on April 4, 1993.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Romanov] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 2 Jun -- A claim by the U.S. magazine U.S. 
NEWS AND WORLD REPORT that several thousand scientists and 
technical specialists from the former USSR are currently working 
to contract in China on the creation of new weapons systems was 
described as "absolutely without foundation" today by a 
representative of the Chinese Foreign Ministry. 
  Replying to a question from ITAR-TASS, the Chinese diplomat 
remarked that reports of Russian weapons experts helping his 
country to modernize its armaments crop up from time to time in 
the U.S. media. He laughed at the magazine's citing of U.S. 
intelligence sources. "U.S. intelligence always gets it wrong," 
he said. 
  On Wednesday, the U.S. magazine's story was denied by a 
senior official from the Russian Foreign Ministry. 
  "I suppose there are some contracts for our technical 
specialists to go to China," he told ITAR-TASS, "but I very much 
doubt their number is as high as that, especially in such a 
delicate and sensitive area of cooperation. I think that it 
does happen, but in single figures." 
  "Thousands of them--that is a crazy figure," ITAR-TASS was 
told on the same day by a qualified source at the Russian 
Federation Foreign Intelligence Service. "Until recently," he 
added, "we had no instances of anybody working in arms 
production." 
  According to other sources, Russian specialists, especially 
in aircraft construction, are attracting great attention from 
Beijing. These are mainly middle-ranking technicians whose pay 
in China would as a rule not exceed 1,000 dollars a month. That 
is considerably less than they would get in the West, but a lot 
more than in Russia.

  [Text] Geneva, 2 June -- Bosnian Serb leader Radovan 
Karadzic plans to visit Moscow next week. The Serbian leader, 
who is also well known as a poet, said today in an exclusive 
interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent in Geneva that the 
trip is connected with his being awarded the literary Mikhail 
Sholokhov Prize by the Russian Union of Writers. In addition, 
Radovan Karadzic intends to make use of his stay in Moscow to 
have talks about the rapid achievement of peace in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina. 
  According to the Serbian leader, the trip is planned for 
about 8-12 June.

  [Text] Geneva June 2 TASS -- Bosnian Serb leader Radovan 
Karadzic thinks that the U.N. promoted ceasefire talks on 
Bosnia- Herzegovina, which were scheduled to be held today, can 
be held in Geneva on Friday [3 June]. In an exclusive interview 
with ITAR- TASS, Karadzic expressed the hope that a ceasefire 
agreement can be signed at these talks. "The Serbs, Karadzic 
said, "have been seeking such an agreement for the past two 
years." 
  The talks were cancelled virtually a few minutes before 
their 
scheduled opening today. A decision to this effect was made by 
special U.N. secretary-general's envoy in Yugoslavia Yasushi 
Akashi. He motivated his step by the Bosinan Serbs' failure to 
fulfil their obligation to withdraw troops from a 3-km zone 
around the Moslem enclave of Gorazde. Commenting on the 
situation in Geneva, the Bosnian Serb leader said that the 
Moslem side has once again succeeded in avoiding the talks. 
  The Serb leader surmised that the complications, which have 
cropped up regarding the reported arrival of Serb units in the 
vicinity of Gorazde, can be settled. 
  The Serb delegation intends to take part in the "contact 
group" session on Bosnia of which diplomats of Russia, United 
States, Great Britain, Germany and France are members. The 
session, to which the Moslems and the Croats are also invited, 
is scheduled to be held in the French mission in the European 
department of the U.N. It will resume discussions, which had 
begun at the previous similar meeting held in the French city of 
Talloires at the end of May. The Serb delegation will be led by 
Momcilo Krajisnik, chaiman of the parliament of the republic 
proclaimed by the Bosnian Serbs.

  [Text] Moscow, 3 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- The question of signing 
an agreement between Russia and the European Union [EU] on 
partnership and cooperation was a focal point at a meeting 
between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Greek Foreign 
Minister Karolos Papoulias in Moscow today. 
  At the start of the meeting the Russian president expressed 
amazement that "Russia occupies half of Europe and is still not 
in Europe." The Greek minister stressed that Greece, which is 
the current chairman in the EU's leading bodies, is among those 
countries which actively support the idea of close ties between 
Russia and the EU. 
  Karolos Papoulias invited Boris Yeltsin to the Greek island 
of Kerkira [Corfu] 24-25 June for a meeting between the leaders 
of the EU countries to conclude an agreement between Russia and 
the EU. He gave an assurance that everything is ready for the 
signing of this important document.

<F P=106> [Yelena Kalyadina report: "Minister Happy, Wife </F>
`Concerned'"] 
  [Text] Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias' three-day 
visit to the Russian capital is taking place, as we used to say, 
in an atmosphere of total mutual understanding. And this is by 
no means journalistic affectation on my part, but literally the 
opinion that the Greek visitor and his Russian counterpart A. 
Kozyrev voiced after their talks yesterday. The said 
understanding has been observed on a whole range of issues. 
  In particular, we are demonstrating total unity of views on 
the problem of a Yugoslav settlement. And this unity presumably 
enabled the two ministers, by the Russian foreign minister's 
admission, to outline a number of future steps in this noble 
work. 
  Andrey Kozyrev and Karolos Papoulias were both happy with 
the 
way in which economic ties are developing between Russia and 
Greece. Admittedly, I would like to add on behalf of the 
representatives of big business with whom I spoke: We are still 
a long way from perfection since we still prefer the 
wide-ranging barter of furs and citrus fruits to wide-ranging 
cooperation in major spheres. But it is a source of joy that 
"we have the political will" to achieve this perfection (I am 
again quoting Andrey Vladimirovich). 
  However, we (Russia) are particularly delighted by the fact 
that Greece, currently president of the European Union [EU], has 
kept the promise that it made on taking up office and has, where 
possible, promoted rapprochement between our fatherland and the 
EU. Minister Kozyrev thanked the Greek Government for this 
support. After which he intrigued the journalists at the press 
conference by admitting that "there may be major events in this 
sphere" shortly. 
  Journalists were naturally interested as to what events 
these 
might be. Since before he left for Moscow in an interview with 
ITAR-TASS Karolos Papoulias spoke of the possible signing of a 
partnership agreement between the EU and Russia -- during the EU 
leaders' coming meeting on the Greek island of Corfu. 
Nevertheless Andrey Vladimirovich did not satisfy my 
colleagues' interest. And instead of providing a concrete 
answer said that this summer children from the North of Russia 
will be going to Greece for a vacation "due to" Greek charity. 
Evidently in order to ease our disappointment he revealed a 
family secret: His wife, who is head of the "Concern" [Zabota] 
Children's Fund, is in charge of sending the children.

  [Text] Moscow June 2 TASS -- Russia is quite ready to sign 
a full-scale and specific agreement on cooperation with the 
European Union, according to Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the 
State Duma Committee for International Affairs. It is still 
early to speak about Russia's membership in the Union but it is 
already necessary to begin a serious preparatory process. 
  Closer economic ties with western Europe is also important 
because Russia may soon join the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade (GATT), Lukin said. Negotiations on this have 
practically entered the home stretch. 
  The agreement with the European Union, according to Lukin, 
must be equitable, correspond to the Russian state's short-term 
and long- term interests and facilitate the provision of equal 
opportunities in trade. This is the only way permitting Russia 
to strengthen its currency and carry out economic reform 
relaying on its own strength. So far the West's readiness for 
equitable partnership in trade is expressed mainly in words and 
as soon as competitive Russian goods hit the international 
markets, the system of quotas and constraints is put in force. 
This approach must be discarded, and specific, realistic and 
tough negotiations should begin, Lukin stressed. 
  The principle of equality should prevail also in the sphere 
of political partnership, Lukin said. Russia has a rich 
experience of "reacting to crises" and is prepared for honest 
cooperation in the settlement in prevention of conflicts in 
Europe, proceeding from both the continental and national 
security interests. 
  Touching on the Bosnian crisis in this context, Lukin spoke 
out against the "ill-considered publicity-oriented airstrike 
policy" and any bloodshed it is fraught with. He stressed the 
need for peace dialogue at the negotiating table by the warring 
parties. 
  As concerns Russia's possible part in the NATO programme 
"Partnership for Peace", Lukin declared that the proposals which 
Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev had taken to Brussels 
took considerable account of the recommendations given him by 
the State Duma and its International Affairs Committee. 
  According to Lukin, it was "an acceptable variant for a 
serious discussion". As regards the outcome of Grachev's 
discussions with the NATO leadership, it is to early to draw 
conclusions because no detailed information on this score has 
been forwarded by the executive to the Russian parliament.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Nadein report: "Commander in Chief Clinton Comes </F>
to Europe To Celebrate All Victories at Once"] 
  [Text] Washington -- U.S. President Bill Clinton has left 
on a nine-day tour of Europe with one main objective -- to lead 
the ceremonies in France. Allied troops landed here on the 
shores of Normandy 50 years ago, 6 June 1944. The colorful and 
costly celebrations for which people in the United States and 
Europe have been preparing for a long time are designed to show 
that it was this event, known here as D-Day, that brought the 
decisive breakthrough in World War II. 
  One cannot help hearing distinctly chauvinistic notes in the 
long, triumphal precelebration campaign. I must warn you right 
away that, if anyone imagines that the mass media are denying 
the role of the Soviet Army or events on the Eastern Front, say, 
or that the Americans are scornful of and deaf to the casualties 
and devastation suffered by the USSR, that impression is 
mistaken. 
  When I talk about chauvinism I mean the strictly U.S. form, 
whereby recognition of the merits of other participants in the 
great war gets lost in a boundless sea of highly varied and 
excellent material in all conceivable genres. You get the 
feeling from this plethora of material of a U.S. triumph -- U.S. 
above all -- over the German military machine, and persistent 
parallels with the victorious battle in the desert against 
Saddam Husayn, not entirely overshadowed by what are in this 
case inappropriate memories of Vietnam, create a general picture 
of the logic and inevitability of the last and only superpower's 
victory in the Cold War as well. 
  By no means everything that is being broadcast at the moment 
will remain in the memory of the pragmatic Americans once the 
celebrations are over. But no means everything will be 
forgotten. The theatrical rerun of the allied landing in 
Normandy (and a precise copy of it on the same day in the United 
States, near Norfolk) will remain in the memory as virtually 
documentary evidence of insuperable U.S. might. 
  President Bill Clinton, who has already gotten weary of 
defending himself against charges of wavering and inconsistency 
in the world arena and reluctance to offer the world U.S. 
leadership, will speak solemnly and at length about the heroic 
deeds of "our fathers and grandfathers." But he will voice 
another conviction (and this may not please some people in 
Europe) -- that the era of U.S. paratroops deployed far from the 
United States is gone forever and that, while the Americans are 
not averse to leading the planet -- with advice, open trade, all 
manner of exchanges -- they no longer have the forces and do not 
expect to have the forces to carry out such landings. 
  The return to power in a number of European countries of 
those whom people in the United States consider neofascists 
(Italy) or Communists (Hungary, Poland, Lithuania) compels the 
President to speak with unprecedented delicacy both on the 
problems arising from the victories 50 years ago and the triumph 
in the Cold War. Another tricky element is that the U.S. 
President, who under to the U.S. Constitution is supreme 
commander in chief, once refused to serve in the Army on 
ideological grounds. 
  What is more, he was an active participant in the pacifist 
movement during his education at Britain's Oxford University. 
That is why Bill Clinton has not included a visit to Oxford in 
his agenda and in the United States chose a slightly older 
audience in order to ensure that the commander in chief's thanks 
for their good service did not elicit undesirable comparisons. 
  During a meeting with World War II veterans on the eve of 
his 
departure for Rome President Bill Clinton said that he had been 
studying specially for several weeks the course of the combat 
operations in Europe. 
  One can say without stretching a point that the U.S. 
President is a fairly rare exception among his people. The 
overwhelming majority of the U.S. population are quite sincerely 
unaware of what kind of war it was, who fought whom during it, 
and, importantly, why.

<F P=106> [Igor Chernov report: "Will Peacemakers Go Into Abkhazia?"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Sochi -- Late last week the first subunits of 
the airborne assault units that are to be introduced into 
Abkhazia as peacemaking forces were dispatched to the Russian 
military airfield at Gudauta. According to Abkhazian sources, 
the airborne troops come from the Leningrad and Volga Military 
Districts. If they take up positions along the Inguri River and 
in the Kodor Gorge, the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict will shift 
to the stage of purely political confrontation. Needless to 
say, the peacemakers will not resolve the problems that caused 
the war, but they will be able to prevent armed clashes from 
flaring up again. [passage omitted] 
  Representatives of the Georgian and Abkhazian military 
departments spent all last week at work in Moscow. With the 
mediation and participation of Russian Defense Ministry officers 
they drafted a schedule and plan for disengagement and for the 
introduction of peacemaking forces. Official Tbilisi was 
acquainted with the plan at the weekend. Russian Defense 
Ministry experts confirmed the previous dates for the 
introduction of the peacemakers -- 10 through 15 June. 
  At the moment the following can be said about the impending 
disengagement of the adversaries: They will pull back 12 km 
into their territory from the contact line along the Inguri 
River. "Blue helmets" will take up positions in the resulting 
corridor. Something similar will also happen on the second 
Abkhazian front -- in the Kodor Gorge, where serious fighting 
started this spring. According to experts, once the peacemaking 
forces have been deployed the conflicting parties will no longer 
be able to launch full-scale combat operations. 
  Regrettably, I cannot avoid using the word "if" in this 
commentary because today there is still no 100-percent 
confidence that the peacemakers really will be brought into 
Abkhazia. Events show that the good intentions could be 
frustrated. [passage omitted] 
  Who stands to gain from provocations on the eve of the 
peacemaking forces' introduction? Presumably not the 
Abkhazians. The accords that have been secured satisfy the 
Sukhumi leadership on the whole. The peacemakers will, after 
all, be introduced in the way the Abkhazians planned -- between 
the enemies' troops, and not throughout the republic's territory 
as the Georgians demanded. The peacemaking forces' presence will 
put the conflict on ice indefinitely and, as I have already 
pointed out, will rule out the possibility of the problem of 
Abkhazian separatism being resolved by military means. It is 
also important for the Abkhazians that it is Russian airborne 
troops being brought into the republic, rather than the 
international forces for which Eduard Shevardnadze 
unsuccessfully appealed for so long. On the whole people in 
Abkhazia note some warming on Russia's part: The Russian 
Government has allocated 2 billion rubles in aid, the republic 
has been admitted as an associate member to the Association for 
Socioeconomic Cooperation Between the Republics, Krays, and 
Oblasts of the Russian Federation's North Caucasus Region, and 
members of the association have asked the Russian Government to 
lift economic sanctions. 
  However, there are forces in Georgia that categorically 
oppose the proposed scenario for settling the conflict. I am 
talking about the Union for the Liberation of Abkhazia led by 
Boris Kakubava, a member of the Georgian parliament. The Union 
comprises Georgian refugees from Abkhazia, mainly active 
participants in the combat operations on the republic's 
territory. They sharply criticize Eduard Shevardnadze's policy, 
saying that he is mainly to blame for the lost battles and 
calling for the war to be prosecuted to a victorious conclusion. 
By all accounts, Kakubava also has supporters in the Georgian 
Army units opposing the Abkhazian Armed Forces. It is quite 
possible that they will take some action to wreck the 
disengagement plan in the time remaining until the peacemaking 
forces are introduced.

<F P=106> [Report by Igor Cherevko: "No Boarding Without a Visa"] </F>
  [Text] A visa requirement imposed by Lithuania to 
transit its territory by passengers from other CIS states has 
created serious problems in the relations between the October 
Railroad and the Ukrainian Administration of Railroads. 
Since this country imposed the visa regime, the St. 
Petersburg-Lvov train, which transits Lithuania, has been empty 
in both directions. 
  The Ukrainian Administration of Railroads asked the October 
Railroad to resolve with the Republic of Lithuania the question 
of repealing the transit visa requirement. There is a precedent: 
Passengers on the St. Petersburg-Kaliningrad train do not need 
such visas. The management of the Ukrainian Administration of 
Railroads suggested that the October Railroad stop selling 
tickets for this train until the problem with Lithuania is 
settled.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Pochinok, deputy chairman of the State </F>
Duma Committee for the Budget, Taxes, Banks, and Finances: 
"Budget as Mirror of Russian Economy. Neither Government Nor 
Parliament Prevents It From Being Examined More Frequently"] 
  [Text] After a long and stormy session on 15 April the 
State Duma adopted the draft budget submitted by the government 
as a basis and proposed that the government make changes to the 
basic features of the document within two weeks and submit it 
for first-reading examination by the Duma. 
  The difficulty and complexity of the debate clearly showed 
how vulnerable the current budget is to criticism. Undoubtedly 
it was better-prepared than previous ones, the methods used to 
draw it up had changed, there were virtually no secret or hidden 
articles, the foreign economic activity section had been 
fundamentally altered, and it proposed for the first time 
introducing a system of transfer payments [transferty] to 
support needy Federation components. The budget is very 
realistic and describes the difficult position of the Russian 
economy without embellishment. It retains the best features of 
the financial stabilization program that was begun in 1993 and 
makes it possible to reduce the inflation rate to 9-10 percent a 
month. Adoption of the budget will make it possible to finance 
a whole host of highly important programs that are being put off 
owing to the lack of a budget. Payments on domestic debt -- on 
commodity bonds, checks, and targeted deposits -- will increase 
sharply. And it is not even a question of erroneous figures, 
although there are some of those. There are some fundamental 
grounds for concern. 
  The most important problem is the delay in the submission 
[predostavleniye] of the budget for a year and the lack of a 
number of fundamental decisions on fiscal and customs policy. 
We are well aware of the consequences that this delay will 
have. Two options could operate in the future -- either the 
scrupulous work on the 1994 budget (during which it will be 
necessary to make substantial changes to tax and budget 
legislation) will continue, or work on the budget will be 
concluded as quickly as possible and attention turned to 
implementing fiscal and customs reform and to preparing the 1995 
budget on time. Both of these things cannot be done at the same 
time. If the first option is followed, the annual budget will 
be adopted only late in the fall and Russia will go into 1995, 
once again, without a budget. In the second instance we would 
lose a little as regards the current budget, but we would 
prepare properly for 1995. 
  The budget's clear deficiencies include clearly overstated 
levels of tax revenue, traditionally understated expenditure on 
education, health care, science, culture, and social welfare, 
huge amounts of administrative expenditure, and the retention of 
many unjustified tax and customs concessions. The budget was 
drawn up on the basis of a proposal on the need to repeal many 
articles of laws and paragraphs of edicts and decrees that are 
leading to increased spending. These laws, edicts, and decrees 
should now be altered or suspended. In order to imagine how 
unwieldy this work will be, we need only mention that it was 
initially proposed to alter almost 100 documents involving 
around 90 trillion [rubles] in expenditure. 
  The two weeks spent on finalization were not wasted by the 
government. Numerous additional materials and calculations 
envisaged by the law on the foundations of the budgetary system 
and the budgetary process were sent to parliament. Draft 
amendments have been made to existing legislation. Individual 
features of the budget have been altered. The proposed amounts 
of revenue from excise duties on consumer goods have been 
lowered. The government has recognized that it is impossible to 
levy a 35-percent excise duty on machines produced. By 
repealing concessions and doing a better job of collecting taxes 
it is planned to increase revenue from import-export duties by 
R2.4 trillion and to increase targeted levies for the provision 
of financial aid to the agro-industrial complex and the coal 
industry by R1.1 trillion. It is additionally planned to obtain 
R1 trillion from privatization and R1 trillion from oil excise 
duties. 
  More than R9 trillion will additionally be channeled into 
agriculture, of which R2.4 trillion will be used for capital 
investment in targeted programs such as "Baby Food," "Sugar," 
and so forth; and it is planned to allocate R5.6 trillion for 
the creation of federal and regional food funds. The principle 
of food being purchased at home rather than abroad will finally 
be laid down. Spending on television, radio broadcasting, 
support for the periodical press, health care, and youth policy 
will be increased. 
  But even the government-amended version of the budget 
conceals major problems. The most obvious is the increase in 
the budget deficit. Income has increased by R3.8 trillion, 
spending by R10.2 trillion, and the deficit by R6.4 trillion to 
stand at R68.8 trillion (9.5 percent of GDP). This is a huge 
figure. The deficit is far more than R1,000 per day for 
everyone in the country, including the old and infants. The 
sources used to fund it are mainly inflationary -- Central Bank 
credits of R44.4 trillion and R19.3 trillion in foreign loans. 
  Nonetheless, the proposal from the "Yabloko" faction to 
increase the deficit to 43-45 percent of spending is a powerful 
one. With the planned level of income this would come to more 
than R93 trillion. There is no way to fund this deficit apart 
from bank loans, and this means that instead of last year's R10 
trillion, we would have to borrow R70 trillion from the Central 
Bank this year. There would be another cascade of worthless bank 
notes without any backing whatsoever, and prices would skyrocket. 
  The purposes for which it is proposed to use the additional 
funds are very attractive -- structural changes to the economy 
and increased financial support for the regions. But are they 
feasible? Suppose the state once again, as in the days of old, 
were to distribute another R20 trillion in capital investment to 
"priority" and "key" sectors -- what then? Would we have to 
send out armed men to guard every ruble? Remember the 
archetypal example of the "GAZ" Plant, which used its tax 
concessions not for investment but to buy vouchers. With 
inflation and with salaries constantly having to be paid, who 
will voluntarily invest money if there is little chance of 
making a profit? 
  The territories undoubtedly need help. And it is correct if 
we are pursuing a policy based on the principle of "take from 
whoever has anything left and give to those who shout loudest." 
The Finance Ministry wants to switch to transfer payments 
worked out on the basis of a single method. Except that there 
is one coefficient that would be out of place. In order to 
determine whether a region needs subsidies, it will now be 
necessary to compare per capita income in the given territory 
with Russia as a whole, and if the territory figure is higher 
than the Russian figure the region will get no subsidies. But 
prevailing price levels are not taken into account. For 
instance, if per capita income is R200,000 in Russia as a whole, 
R199,000 in Krasnodar Kray, and R201,000 in Krasnoyarsk Kray, 
then Krasnodar Kray will get the money -- and the fact that 
budget expenditure should objectively be higher in the North 
will not be taken into account. 
  The State Duma committees' conclusion about the draft budget 
proposes retaining at last year's level the proportion of funds 
transferred from federal budget funds to territories' budgets, 
as well as the proportion of taxes and imposts retained by 
Federation component budgets. At first glance this looks right, 
but there are serious objections. First, the budget simply does 
not have this money. Second, if funds are sought by increasing 
the budget deficit, price growth will just "eat up" the entire 
benefit of the extra money. Third, we cannot retain last year's 
unfair distribution system, whereby funds were collected from a 
handful of industrial territories and distributed among most of 
the other Federation components. 
  We need to make substantial amendments to both the revenue 
and expenditure sides of the budget. The main thing in our 
further work on revenue is to prepare for tax reform. To my 
mind, the approach should be extremely simple. First and 
foremost, we need to abolish existing individual concessions -- 
this mainly applies to exports of goods. We need to step up tax 
organs' work in collecting taxes -- above all, in the trading 
sphere and those sectors of the economy where "black cash" (that 
is, money that is unaccounted-for) traditionally looms large. 
Distributing taxes equally among all payers will make it 
possible to lower tax rates. It is time to get rid completely of 
the taxation of profits used for investment. We can only 
welcome the government's resolute steps in respect of the state 
monopoly on liquor and tobacco products. It is time to increase 
tax on individuals' excess income and, on the other hand, to 
restore the former tax-exempt status of certain amounts of 
material aid, prizes, and gifts. Nor should concessionary 
travel be taxable. How are we to explain to pensioners that 
they should pay out almost their entire pension in taxation on 
free travel? 
  Serious changes are also needed on the expenditure side of 
the budget. First and foremost, we need a careful and planned 
reduction in spending on the bloated administrative apparatus -- 
there are some clearly unrealistic targets [obyekty] in the 
investment section as well. On the other hand, the problem of 
reforming the wages system has not been resolved and there is no 
funding for a whole host of highly important social and cultural 
projects. The Army and defense enterprises also need support.

<F P=106> [Nikolay Gorlov report: "Ruble Will Replace Voucher"] </F>
  [Text] "There is a possibility of a fundamental change in 
the macroeconomic situation," Russian Federation Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin said yesterday at a conference of 
administration heads at the Russian Federation Government. The 
Constitution itself and the packages of presidential economic 
edicts that were signed last week provide the legislative 
preconditions for this. 
  "The crisis has peaked," V. Chernomyrdin pointed out. The 
government's task in 1995-1997 should be to definitively improve 
the economic situation; that is, bring reform into the sphere of 
production. However, a base for this has already been prepared. 
This is illustrated by the figures for the growth in production 
and the emergent stabilization of the ruble (in particular, the 
gradual reduction in inflation rates and the reduction in 
Central Bank refinancing rates, the prime minister said. 
  According to V. Chernomyrdin, Russia's regions have always 
acted as the motive force of reform. That is why the conference 
with their leaders is devoted to examining such issues as 
measures to complete check privatization and also to discussing 
the Program for the Privatization of State and Municipal 
Enterprises After 1 July 1994 and the new Russian Federation 
Land Code. 
  The voucher as a means of payment will disappear into 
oblivion after 30 June this year -- the end of the first phase 
of check privatization -- Viktor Chernomyrdin stressed. 
  Despite some complacency at local level, the prime minister 
noted in his speech, privatization checks' period of validity 
will not be extended. Today it is necessary to structure work 
in the localities so as to ensure that there are as few checks 
left as possible -- as souvenirs. 
  During the new post-check phase, the head of the Russian 
Government noted, investment will resolve everything. Viktor 
Chernomyrdin described as unviable some regions' requests for 
special rules of privatization for themselves. The transfer of 
Russian state property into private hands will proceed within a 
single, indivisible legislative area. What is more, in order to 
prevent possible abuse, state bodies' supervision of 
privatization for money will be stepped up, Viktor Chernomyrdin 
stressed in particular. 
  It was noted at the conference that the check phase of 
privatization has by and large been successful. There have 
generally been no problems in those areas where the local 
authorities have taken a serious approach to the work. However, 
there are regions where the population still has a considerable 
number of unredeemed privatization checks on its hands. In some 
areas there are objective difficulties, for instance, in the 
North Caucasus. In Moscow privatization has effectively been 
suspended by decision of the local government. Leaders in 
Kemerovo, Ulyanovsk, and a number of other oblasts and 
Khabarovsk and Maritime Krays hoped that the government would 
ultimately find a way of "soaking up" citizens' privatization 
checks that have not been redeemed through the fault of the 
local administrations. These leaders will have to resolve the 
possible ensuing social conflicts themselves. At the same time 
those regions where privatization has been protracted for 
objective reasons will be offered assistance in the final stage, 
primarily by broadening opportunities for vouchers to be 
exchanged for investment fund shares. 
  The conference also discussed the program for the next phase 
of privatization. It has been formulated with consideration for 
proposals from the regions and has absorbed all the best of what 
has been tested at local level. In this respect Moscow, Nizhniy 
Novgorod, Sverdlovsk, Chelyabinsk, and Yaroslavl Oblasts are 
working creatively. People there are not waiting for 
instructions from the center on everything but are seeking their 
own solutions on questions pertaining to the management of 
property, the allocation of funds from privatization, and the 
acceleration of privatization processes. 
  The new program takes into consideration the regions' main 
complaints. They related primarily to understated property 
valuations, low revenue from privatization, overly large 
concessions for labor collectives. During the second phase 
privatization will be implemented solely in return for money. 
The estimated cost of facilities undergoing privatization will 
rise tens of times. 
  In terms of the amount of property to be privatized the 
second phase of privatization is comparable to the first. The 
fate of both major industrial enterprises and facilities in 
municipal ownership will be decided during this phase.

  [Text] Moscow June 2 -- "Voucher privatisation has failed 
not only in Moscow, but in all the Russian regions. It has not 
been successful because the authors of the programme were 
pursuing political, not economic goals," declared Moscow Mayor 
Yuriy Luzhkov at a press-conference in the Moscow government 
building on Thursday. According to the mayor, the founding of 
voucher privatisation on the "dictates of the Federal State 
Property Managing Committee" was not fair to the regions of the 
Russian Federation. 
  Luzhkov noted that the government never received the 
expected 
inflow of funds from the privatisation programme. Over the last 
two and a half years, according to Luzhkov, the capital's budget 
gained only a "ridiculously small sum" from privatisation, 52 
billion roubles. The most convincing evidence that the 
privatisation programme is a failure is that even today there is 
no class of property-owners in the country as a whole and in 
Moscow in particular. 
  The capital's mayor said that the current market value of 
one 
voucher, 30 thousand roubles, is way under the minimum value of 
half a million roubles a voucher should have if inflation is 
taken into account. He called that proof of the public's 
mistrust of the privatisation programme. Five hundred thousand 
roubles is the real value of one one-hundred-and-sixty-millionth 
part of the country's wealth, said Luzhkov. 
  "I will be happy to go to the procurator," the mayor said in 
comment on Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's letter of May 26 
which demanded that Luzhkov cancel within three days his ban on 
the registration of joint stock societies in Moscow. 
  According to Luzhkov, the complaints which State Property 
Committee Chairman Anatoliy Chubays has lodged against the 
Moscow government in connection with the failure of 
privatisation in the capital are based on the desire "to avoid 
responsibility for privatisation's catastrophic results for the 
Russian economy and to find a scapegoat."

<F P=106> [Yelena Kotelnikova, Yekaterina Zapodinskaya report in the </F>
"Chubays Versus Luzhkov" column: "The Vice Premier Has Made 
Good on His Threat"] 
  [Text] Yesterday the secretariat of Acting General 
Prosecutor Aleksey Ilyushenko began consideration of a letter 
from Vice Premier Anatoliy Chubays over gross violations of the 
privatization law by the Moscow mayor and government. This 
development opens a way to resolving the conflict between 
Chubays and Luzhkov within a legal framework. However, the 
length of the examination (not less than a month, according to 
prosecution officials), as voucher privatization is drawing to a 
close (1 July), reduces the practical value of its results for 
the victims. 
  According to an official source in the General Prosecutor's 
Office, Chubays' letter will shortly be given for study to 
Deputy General Prosecutor Sabir Kekhlerov, who oversees in 
particular the preparation of arbitration suits in court. The 
source also said that in all likelihood, consideration of the 
"Luzhkov case" will continue for more than a month (one month 
under the law) because "a huge number of documents" and even 
verbal instructions from the mayor will have to be analyzed. As 
a result, on each unlawful decision by the Moscow authorities 
with respect to privatization, suits are to be prepared on 
annulling all illegal deals. 
  By going to court, therefore, Chubays made good on his 
recent 
threat to take measures to countermand a number of Luzhkov's 
recent resolutions limiting the conduct of voucher privatization 
in Moscow. Regardless of decisions by the General Prosecutor's 
Office, Chubays' move can even now yield some political 
dividends. 
  First, the chairman of the State Property Management 
Committee has received an opportunity to distance himself 
officially from the "catastrophic" (according to Chubays) 
consequences of privatization in Moscow which, he believes, will 
lead to "a major social explosion on 30 June." 
  Second, Chubays has relieved himself of the energy-consuming 
occupation of the chronic theoretical dispute with efficient 
economic manager Luzhkov about the harm and usefulness of 
voucher privatization for the people and Russia. 
  Third, by taking such a step, the head of the State Property 
Management Committee has reminded that voucher privatization has 
a legal basis (in contrast to the "special" Moscow privatization 
program) while his (Chubays') department is responsible only for 
the quality of its execution. 
  All this also responds to Chubays' objectives to demonstrate 
to President Boris Yeltsin and Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin that 
he is in full control of the privatization process. This is 
especially pertinent since the completion of the final round of 
privatization stimulates the activity of the vice premier's 
opponents who call for his resignation. 
  Judging by Luzhkov's recent statements, he is ready for 
retaliatory action with respect to Chubays, the author of the 
privatization "fraud" (according to Luzhkov). In particular the 
mayor has expressed his readiness "with great pleasure" to 
arrive at the prosecutor's office together with Chubays where he 
intends to explain that "property must be sold, not wasted away, 
as is now happening with Chubays-style privatization." 
  Presumably at today's press conference Yuriy Luzhkov will 
acquaint journalists in some detail with his countermeasures.

  [Text] Russia has never intended to veto the development of 
Caspian off shore oil deposits, a senior Russian government 
official, responsible for the oil and gaz complex told the Oil 
Information Agency on Thursday. 
  In his words, national interests in the Caspian region will 
be protected by developing the network of export oil pipe-lines 
and by helping Russian companies to consolidate their position 
on oil markets. 
  "Charges that Moscow is striving to dominate or assume some 
exceptional rights to develop Caspian oil deposits are ludicrous 
and disregard one simple fact: the bulk of the oil extracted on 
the shelf will all the same be exported across the territory of 
Russia," the official said. 
  He described as "a campaign coordinated in favour of western 
firms" press reports that Russia is demanding the right to veto 
the Caspian shelf's development. 
  The British newspaper Financial Times has reported with 
reference to Russian government sources that in a confidential 
letter to London Russia's Foreign Ministry made it clear that a 
sanction from Moscow is essential for implementing all Caspian 
shelf projects.

<F P=106> [Ivan Zhagel report: "Foreign Banks Will Have Wider Access </F>
to Russian Financial Market"] 
  [Text] Viktor Gerashchenko, chairman of the Central Bank 
of Russia, has stated that decisions will be adopted by 8 June 
to extend the opportunities for foreign banks to penetrate 
Russia. 
  It is well known that last November such opportunities were 
substantially restricted by a presidential edict. A kind of 
veto was imposed not only on the registration of new branches of 
foreign credit institutions, but also on certain transactions by 
banks already existing in Russia. It is no secret that this 
decision was adopted in response to demands by our own bankers, 
who were afraid of an unequal competitive struggle. But for 
every action, as is well known, there is a reaction. 
  According to V. Gerashchenko, foreign states promptly made 
access to their own financial markets tougher. For Russian 
banks it became an insoluble problem not only to open branches 
abroad, but even offices. In addition, the prohibitive measures 
on our side were assessed negatively by international financial 
organizations, and at the moment, in view of our need not only 
for new credits but also for the deferral of debt repayments, it 
is quite inappropriate to quarrel with them. 
  However, the forthcoming simplification of access to our 
financial market does not mean that the registration of foreign 
banks will now take place more or less automatically. Last year 
the Central Bank imposed a so-called "limit on participation by 
foreign capital in the country's banking system," namely 12 
percent. This means that the total capital of branches of 
foreign banks as a proportion of the gross capital of all banks 
on Russia's territory must not be more than that level. 
  As of today this quota is virtually exhausted, so the 
registration of new branches of foreign banks is highly 
problematical. But this restrictive measure appears more 
intelligent than a simple ban, and it is not causing a negative 
response among international organizations. V. Gerashchenko 
confirmed that the "limit on participation by foreign capital in 
the country's banking system" will be maintained, although the 
level could be adjusted. That is, the process of foreign banks' 
penetration will be controlled. 
  Incidentally, V. Gerashchenko, making all these statements 
at 
a specially arranged press conference, did not omit to reproach 
"certain journalists" for trying recently to represent him as in 
some way opposed to the president's much-publicized edicts in 
the sphere of economic policy. According to him, the documents 
were prepared with the Central Bank's participation, and he 
simply could not be opposed to them. 
  V. Gerashchenko not only confirmed his commitment to the 
radical economic edicts, but make equally radical subsequent 
statements. For instance, he noted that this very week the 
Central Bank board of directors may adopt a decision on a future 
lowering of the interest rate on centralized credits, which will 
certainly have a beneficial effect on investment processes. On 
the other hand, he came out categorically against using coercion 
on commercial banks in the setting of their interest rates, 
since "nothing useful can come of that" -- cheap credits are 
simply squandered. 
  Finally, V. Gerashchenko promised that the practice of 
auction sales of centralized credit resources will be extended 
and in the near future such auctions will be held every two 
weeks. Regular, open dealings in credit resources will help 
people to form a clearer idea of how much money costs in our 
country. 
  And aother important question was raised at the press 
conference. Many people wanted to know how to interpret the 
section of the president's edict on the normalization of 
accounts which states that "legal entities may obtain monetary 
resources from the bank for pressing needs to the tune of...up 
to five times the minimum monthly wage, depending on the total 
average listed number of workers." V. Gerashchenko explained 
that enterprises can reserve this sum even before the payment of 
funds into the budget, so as to offer at least some support to 
their workers. And those who fulfill their commitments to the 
state can take out money for wages in the necessary quantities.

<F P=106> [Unattributed RIA report in the "In Brief" column: "The </F>
Number of Strikes in Russia Is Growing Fast"] 
  [Text] The number of strikes in Russia in the first 
quarter has increased 10.3 times compared to the same time last 
year. They occurred at 288 enterprises, whereas in all of 1993, 
264 concerns were affected. This was announced by Tatyana 
Frolova, secretary of the Federation of Independent Trade Unions 
of Russia [FITUR], who spoke at a session of the FITUR 
Solidarity Action Coordinating Committee. 
  Among the main reasons for the strikes, Frolova cited the 
federal budget's indebtedness, chronic delays in wage payments, 
the absence of a mechanism for mutual settlements, a growth in 
unemployment, and continuous increases in prices for foodstuffs 
and basic goods. Workers' action has been highest in the Komi 
Republic (Vorkuta), western Siberia, and Kemerovo, Tula, and 
Rostov Oblasts.

  [Text] The increase in Russia's military expenditures from 
37 to 55 trillion rubles reflects the Defense Ministry's factual 
expenses taking into account its debts accumulated over the last 
five months, deputy chairman of the parliamentary committee for 
defense, Aleksandr Piskunov said today. 
  As has already been reported, the Federation Council (the 
upper house of the Russian parliament) voted in favor of 
increasing the defense expenditures to 55 trillion rubles 
Thursday. 
  "Either we openly admit that the expenditure will be that 
high, or we will end the year with a debt of 18 trillion 
rubles," Piskunov said in an interview with Interfax. 
  Piskunov believes that the Defense Ministry should develop a 
program for the optimization of its expenses, structure and 
personnel in the near future.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>
  [Text] Sevastopol June 2 TASS -- "A team of naval experts 
is now gauging the strength of the Black Sea navy, especially 
its warships. They are trying to determine the necessary 
parameters for the division of the fleet, including the classes 
of vessels and their technical conditions," Commander-in-Chief 
of the Russian Navy Admiral Felix Gromov told ITAR-TASS. He 
noted that this was not a meeting of two delegations, but the 
work of experts. It is not running very smoothly, because it is 
necessary to study every vessel. 
  Touching on his meeting with Commander-in-Chief of the 
Ukrainian Navy Admiral Vladimir Beskorovaynyy, Gromov said that 
the sides had some uncoinciding points of view and that 
everything should be done to achieve mutual understanding. 
  Dwelling on the anxiety of servicemen, members of their 
families, workers and employees of the naval garrisons 
concerning their future in connection with the fleet's division, 
Gromov noted that all the necessary documents were now being 
discussed and studied. "If a decision is made today on this or 
that question, this will not mean that everything will be 
carried out tomorrow," he stated. The admiral believes that the 
process will continue for quite a time and its main task will be 
to avoid harming people and the navy as a whole. 
  Asked by ITAR-TASS to comment on the situation in the 
Pacific 
Fleet after the dismissal of its commander Georgiy Gurinov, 
Gromov replied: "A very grave accident had occurred on the 
Pacific Fleet and nobody could expect it to be left unnoticed or 
without corresponding serious decisions. A commander bears full 
responsibility for the situation in his fleet."

  [Text] There are over 7,000 servicemen without apartments 
in Moscow today, most of them senior officers from Defense 
Ministry main and central directorates. 
  In January 1994 Defense Minister Pavel Grachev asked Boris 
Yeltsin to allocate 28 billion rubles to ensure the minimum 
improvement in the provision of housing for high-ranking Moscow 
officers and generals. Yeltsin instructed Premier Viktor 
Chernomyrdin to allocate the required amount. Chernomyrdin 
redirected the document to the Finance Ministry, which told the 
military 20 April 1994 that there is no money for housing. 
  Under the Soviet authorities high-ranking servicemen waited 
for housing in the capital for two years at most. Now there are 
102 generals and admirals alone in Moscow without housing. 
Russia-wide there are 169,700 officers without apartments.

<F P=106> [Interview with Nikolay Khlopkin, director of a Kurchatov </F>
Institute department, by Mikhail Rebrov; place and date not 
given: "Nuclear-Powered Ships Are Sending Out an SOS, But There 
Will Continue To Be a Nuclear-Powered Fleet"] 
  [Text] From KRASNAYA ZVEZDA Files 
  Nikolay Sidorovich Khlopkin. Born in 1923. Served during 
the Great Patriotic War, wrote his name on the Reichstag, and 
was badly wounded. Has devoted his working life to 
nuclear-powered ships. Has been at the Kurchatov Institute since 
1949, starting as a laboratory assistant with diploma and now 
director of a department. He is a professor, an academician, 
Hero of Socialist Labor, and winner of Lenin and State Prizes. 
His colleagues say: "From day one through today in 
nuclear-powered ships -- surface and submarine, civilian and 
military." He himself says: "It is interesting work, a long 
and difficult quest whose purpose is to arrive at reliable 
simplicity having mastered the incomparably complex." 
  [Rebrov] Nikolay Sidorovich, the first nuclear-powered 
submarine went on alert status three and a half decades ago, and 
a year later the first nuclear-powered icebreaker was put into 
service. Nowadays the attitude to these events is contradictory 
and sometimes even negative.... 
  [Khlopkin] Our time is full of contradictions generally. 
Anything and everything is criticized without sufficient 
argumentation. It would be naive to claim that nuclear energy 
does not have its dark aspects. But how can the tasks facing 
the Navy be resolved without it? Only nuclear-powered 
submarines are able resolve the tasks facing them without 
surfacing during an entire autonomous patrol. Without 
nuclear-powered ships, how can the northern sea route be turned 
into a permanently operating highway? 
  The logical development of naval nuclear power engineering 
depends to a considerable extent on the country's financial 
resources, which must be used intelligently. 
  [Rebrov] Sadly we have still not learned how to count money. 
Or more precisely how to weigh up the options in order to see a 
realistic prospect. But to go back to submarines: What was 
done during those years? 
  [Khlopkin] Many things. Although even for the first craft 
it was possible to develop a totally unorthodox construction -- 
I mean the scaled-down large unit. This was done under the 
guidance of Academician A.P. Aleksandrov. Many solutions found 
here proved extremely successful and were utilized in subsequent 
projects.... 
  Thanks to the powerful compact units, as a rule our craft 
now 
have higher speeds than foreign equivalents, although inferior 
to them in terms of undetectability. As early as 1970 we had 
nuclear-powered ships with an underwater speed of over 40 knots. 
A further reduction in the noise generated by warships is 
expected, which will ensure that their actions are undetected. 
Comprehensive acoustic design will become an essential integral 
part during the development of new submarines, whereby design 
decisions are aimed at reducing acoustic emissions as much as 
possible. In other words, a submarine must be a kind of 
acoustic "black hole" in the sea which cannot be detected by any 
means. 
  I am giving only my personal opinion. Quiet craft with 
powerful fourth-generation units have been developed. Concepts 
for fifth-generation units are being developed.... 
  This is no easy task. There are prospects of replacing the 
propeller with a water jet and switching to full electric 
propulsion, similar to that used in diesel submarines. It is 
worth mentioning another type of electric propulsion -- without 
a propeller or water jet. The ship's motile thrust is created 
by passing a current through sea water in strong magnetic 
fields. Such an engine needs superconductor cables, ultrahigh 
magnetic fields.... 
  [Rebrov] Nikolay Sidorovich, what main directions can now be 
seen for science here? 
  [Khlopkin] There are several such directions. Safety in 
naval power engineering is out in front. Increasing the 
reliability of units and auto-protection of their reactors by 
creating negative feedback in the core, eliminating coolant 
losses, creating additional barriers to prevent the emission of 
radioactivity.... This are only some of the measures aimed at 
eliminating both accidents themselves and their effects. 
  Safety at sea has its own specific characteristics. Because 
a reactor on a ship is not only a source of danger but also a 
means of saving the ship in an emergency. 
  After that comes the search for new fields in which to use 
and improve nuclear power. There is a multitude of interesting 
prospects here. To some people they might seem unrealistic. 
But in the late forties a nuclear-powered submarine was 
considered a fantastic idea. 
  We should make special mention of the controls. Anatoliy 
Petrovich Aleksandrov demanded that it be as simple as a car's 
-- you step on the gas, take your foot off the gas.... And such 
a reactor was constructed. If the flow of feed water is 
increased the reactor's capacity increases, if it is reduced the 
capacity falls. This is without any adjustment to the absorbers 
which govern reactivity. 
  [Rebrov] You have mentioned technical measures. But there 
is also the human factor.... 
  [Khlopkin] Yes, and it is of very great importance. Here I 
am referring not only to errors by the operator at the control 
panel in a stressful situation. The question is broader. The 
entire system of controlling safety is being examined in order 
to eliminate the possibility of making incorrect decisions at 
the planning stage and to prevent a low quality of equipment 
production and unsatisfactory operation. This is a very complex 
problem, but it is soluble. 
  Questions which need to be solved by the scientists include 
ecological questions. Not only in the operating process but 
also when reactors are taken out of operation.... The strictest 
control is important here. We have developed highly sensitive 
equipment to research sea water radioactivity. It was used to 
inspect the sunken Komsomolets submarine. This is the result: 
The discharge is less than 0.1 curie per year. A few meters 
away from the boat's hull the level is so low that it is 
undetectable. 
  [Rebrov] The nuclear-powered ships are sending out an SOS, 
equipment is getting old, appropriations are being reduced, 
shipyards are idle. The same thing is heard all over: 
conversion, conversion.... But words and deeds do not always 
coincide. How do matters stand as far as you are concerned? 
  [Khlopkin] There is much that is contradictory here. Not in 
the idea itself -- it is indisputable. Conversion is not only a 
consequence of disarmament but also something that stimulates 
it. There is a multitude of questions here: scales, deadlines, 
state support, the consistency and considered nature of 
programs.... Conversion.... Back then we did not even know such 
a word, but we started to get involved in it around 40 years 
ago. Nine civilian nuclear-powered ships have been built, a 
tenth has been launched. Incidentally, if we are talking about 
sensible approaches, it makes sense to replace today's diesel 
icebreakers with nuclear-powered ships as they exhaust their 
service life,. This will be cheaper for Russia. For a number 
of reasons shipyards are empty, but apparently if they are 
filled with orders we give these orders for icebreakers to 
foreign firms. I can illustrate the correlation of prices with 
this example: The Taymyr, with a single-reactor unit, was 
constructed jointly with Finland at a cost of 140 million 
dollars. The Sibir, with a more powerful two-reactor unit, was 
constructed here at a cost of 120 million -- rubles! 
  Another example is floating AES's [nuclear electric power 
stations] to supply heat and electricity to northern coastal 
cities and mineral mines. In this case the extent to which the 
construction site has to be developed is far less, and the area 
of confiscated land is less. These AES's can be relocated at 
any time.... 
  We have developed unique small power units which are 
without equal in the world. They have no moving parts, and the 
current is generated without turbines -- by a thermoelectric 
generator which works off the nuclear reactor. Self-regulating 
thermoelectric stations with minimal maintenance have been 
designed to supply electricity to small settlements and military 
compounds. A heat capacity of up to 5 megawatts and an electric 
capacity of up to 150 kilowatts can be delivered, and the 
service life is up to 25 years. 
  Another example. The "Rosshelf" joint-stock company has been 
set up. It proposes to use defense sectors' potential to carry 
out oil and gas extraction on the continental shelf. The 
initial development of workings in areas with icy conditions, 
where vast reserves of hydrocarbons have already been 
discovered, could be carried out with the aid of nuclear-powered 
icebreakers. They will provide the workings with electricity 
and protect them from ice. Surveying deposits, mapping the 
bottom, and choosing pipe-laying routes can be done by 
submarines. 
  Nuclear units are successfully solving the problem of 
desalinating water, their use in space is extremely promising, 
and they are being eagerly bought abroad. In short, the 
peaceful atom is not just a phrase but a fact. 
  [Rebrov] Currently the following question is being heard 
increasingly frequently: Is it necessary, when disarmament is 
in progress, to improve warships and their power units? Because 
the country is becoming poor.... 
  [Khlopkin] Yes, a considerable reduction in the Navy is now 
under way. Orders for new nuclear-powered ships are being 
sharply reduced. Some of them, unfinished, are being turned 
into scrap metal. This is happening not only in Russia but in 
other countries too. But let us once again proceed from 
realities: War, as the last means of resolving conflict 
situations, has not been excluded from consideration by a single 
state. Russia is a maritime power, and its Navy is 300 hundred 
years old this year. It was Russia's glory, guaranteeing its 
security, and it must remain so now. It is another matter that 
a sea power's naval might is determined not so much by the 
number of ships as by their combat qualities. Admiral Makarov's 
motto "Remember the War" still holds well. 
  [Rebrov] A last question, Nikolay Sidorovich. You were at 
the front. What was the most memorable thing in those years? 
  [Khlopkin] The war itself. With its horrors, its losses, 
and blighted fates, but also the joy of victory.... The war 
ruthlessly displaced customary concepts, turning people's lives 
into another dimension, sometimes inconceivable in its tragedy. 
The last terrible battle was 1 May 1945, when our division was 
holding back the avalanche of German divisions going into Berlin 
from the east. We hung on.... Then there was the meeting with 
the Americans, but that was over the Elbe.... I took off my 
greatcoat with a captain's shoulder boards in 1945; since when I 
have been a civilian and have been greatly involved in civil 
matters. But Russia's military interests are dear to me, which 
is why I say: There will continue to be a nuclear-powered fleet! 
At the moment there is simply no alternative to nuclear power 
for the ocean submarine fleet.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General of Aviation Yevgeniy </F>
Makoklyuyev, first deputy chief of the Air Defense Forces Main 
Staff, by Aleksandr Ivanov; place and date not given: "Air 
Defense Indicates Where to Capture Terrorists. The Press Has 
Never Written About the Role of the Air Defense Forces Men and 
Equipment in Disarming Air Terrorists. Although Not a Single 
Case of Clamping Down on Air Piracy Has Occurred Without Their 
Participation"] 
  [Text] Every time such a situation occurs, a task force is 
formed at the Air Defense Forces high command. Its leader, 
Lieutenant General of Aviation Yevgeniy Makoklyuyev, first 
deputy chief of the Air Defense Forces Main Staff, spoke to our 
correspondent about how it works. 
  [Makoklyuyev] Let us recall last Friday.... The latest 
terrorist act in the Mineralnyye Vody area. At 0900 an A-50 
radar patrol airplane took off from the Privolzhskiy airfield. 
It was faced with the task of reinforcing the radar 
intelligence system in the North Caucasus region. 
  That was the moment when the air defense men and equipment 
began their most vigorous actions to discover the exact route 
taken by the helicopter containing the terrorists and the 
hostages that had been taken, determine the landing site, and, 
if need be, quickly send raiding parties into the area. 
  The alert forces located in the area of the criminals' 
supposed flight were brought to Alert Condition One, an extra 10 
radar subunits were involved, and mobile low-altitude platoons 
were taken out to the position areas. I would observe that this 
was done in a very short space of time. All the information 
about the helicopter's flight was processed by an air defense 
task force in Rostov headed by Lieutenant General Nikolay 
Kurochkin and was then sent to the Air Defense Forces Central 
Command Post. The information received was sent minute by 
minute to the Ministry of Internal Affairs task forces in Rostov 
and Mineralnyye Vody. 
  These measures were necessary because we understood 
perfectly 
well that the criminals, using minimum flight altitudes, the 
mountainous locality, the weather conditions, and various 
maneuvers, would try to shake off the raiding parties that were 
following them in the air and then land and disappear undetected. 
  [Ivanov] That is exactly what terrorists did in the same 
region at the end of December of last year when they took some 
Rostov schoolchildren hostage. 
  [Makoklyuyev] Yes, they flew out of Mineralnyye Vody by 
military helicopter at the lowest possible altitude. The 
weather was terrible: There was fog, and a snowstorm was 
blowing. In a word, the helicopters carrying the raiding party 
lost view of the target. Who could have supposed that the 
criminals would land twice on the route, trying to get their 
bearings and, despite the visibility, which was practically 
zero, find a place near Georgiyevsk where their accomplices were 
evidently waiting for them. Having used up most of the fuel, 
they decided to return to Mineralnyye Vody. And they only flew 
out again after refueling the next morning.... 
  At the same time, taking advantage of the poor visibility, 
the pilots made a landing not five km west of the village of 
Khasavyurt, as the terrorists were demanding, but about 10 km 
north. Then they took off again, this time for Makhachkala. 
  Our A-50 tracked the target for two days, passing on full 
information. It was practically only the air defense systems 
that registered all the criminals' maneuvers in the air and gave 
out precise details of where they landed, and they were were the 
first to furnish the Dagestan Ministry of Security with the 
information about the likely landing place, which made it 
possible to blockade the area in advance and end the operation 
successfully. 
  [Ivanov] But in the latest case the weather was favorable, 
and the tracking helicopters did not get lost.... 
  [Makoklyuyev] Nevertheless we had a lot of trouble with the 
extremely short time frame. And it was not only the air defense 
forces that had this trouble. There was every justification for 
assuming that it was accomplices of the same criminals that had 
gotten down to carrying out the plan that was disrupted in 
December. As soon as the route was determined, the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs task force bore in mind that the terrorists 
might try to escape to Azerbaijan and beyond. Therefore, on the 
instructions of Colonel General of Aviation Viktor Prudnikov, 
commander in chief of the Air Defense Forces, who was in charge 
of all the air defense forces in this operation, we reported to 
the commander of the Azerbaijani air defense. We agreed the 
procedure for the helicopters to fly across their borders 
together with the raiding party and our A-50 airplane, as well 
as the actions that the alert forces should take against the 
intruder. 
  But the criminals landed in Chechnya, just as they had six 
months before. The air defense forces clearly determined the 
landing location, accompanied the helicopter all the time, and 
gave out the necessary information both to the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs organs and to the raiding party. 
  Hundreds of specialists from the radiotechnical troops, 
aviation, command posts, and the leadership of this branch of 
service were employed in making sure that the operation to save 
the people and disarm the criminals passed off successfully.

<F P=106> [Answer given by A. Yablokov, chairman of the </F>
Interdepartmental Commission for Environmental Security at the 
Russian Federation Security Council, to a reader's question: 
"Will Russia Remain a Nuclear Dump?"] 
  [Text] Every now and then, newspapers report that nuclear 
waste from abroad is being dumped in Russia. Is our country 
really going to remain a nuclear dump for the whole world? 
(Sergey Gudkov, Podolsk) 
  [Yablokov] In accordance with agreements signed before 1992, 
nuclear waste is brought to Russia from certain European 
countries (Finland, Bulgaria), where nuclear electric power 
stations built with Soviet participation are in operation. And 
although the Russian Law on the Protection of the Natural 
Environment bans the bringing in, storage, and burial of nuclear 
waste (Article 50), the Ministry of Atomic Energy believes that 
this ban does not concern bringing in spent nuclear fuel for 
treatment, since the intergovernmental agreements were concluded 
before the law was adopted. 
  There is no such intergovernmental agreement with Hungary. 
This one has been concluded at ministry level. Our commission 
believes that we are not obliged to take fuel for treatment from 
Hungary. We also believe that when it fulfills its commitments 
concerning the treatment of spent nuclear fuel, Russia should 
return the waste from the treatment to the countries it came 
from. That is also the State Duma's position. 
  An interdepartmental commission is now striving for a review 
of the concept of a closed nuclear cycle, which emerged during 
the arms race. This was necessary in order to obtain plutonium, 
necessary for preparing nuclear weapons, from the treatment of 
nuclear fuel. Now there is no such need. And it is sensible to 
store waste from nuclear electric power stations over a specific 
period in special storage pits and then bury it like normal 
radioactive waste, which is what the United States does, rather 
than treating it.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 2 TASS -- The Council of the Federation, 
upper chamber of the Russian Parliament, voted to complete the 
discussion of the 1994 federal budget in one hour, but even two 
hours were not enough for this. Chairman of the Chamber's 
Budget Committee Nikolay Gonchar told ITAR-TASS during the break 
that the mps would spend as much time on this problem as 
necessary. "This is the main item on today's agenda," he added. 
  Gonchar explained that the deliberations were held behind 
closed doors because the chamber was discussing defence 
allocations. "The search for compromises is proceeding against 
the background of a very keen debate, because everybody is short 
of money," he stated. The mps plan to offer the state duma, 
which approved the draft budget in first reading, to discuss 
anew several items in the spendings part of the draft. 
  "Faced with the choice of whether to have good relations 
with 
the government or to uphold the interests of the state, the mps 
will definitely choose the latter," Gonchar believes. He 
stressed that "there is no factional or political struggle in 
the upper chamber, but merely a dispute over regional 
interests". "We are apparently faced with the need to 
redistribute the available means, and this is a very painful 
process," he added. Gonchar also said that his committee was 
backing the stand assumed by the chairman of the Duma Committee 
for Economic Affairs Sergey Glazyev, but several economic acts 
were needed to implement his proposals and this would take time.

  [Text] Moscow June 2 TASS -- The Russian Federation 
Council, which approved the key figures of the draft budget on 
Thursday, increased defence appropriations in 1994 from 
initially envisaged 37 trillion rubles to 55 trillion, according 
to First Deputy Defence Minister Andrey Kokoshin. 
  He told TASS by telephone that lawmakers adopted the 
decision 
mostly because the 37-trillion appropriations would mean a 
closure for many defence enterprises and mass unemployment.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 2 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- The Federation Council 
today failed to give its backing to an appeal by the Russian 
president concerning the peacemaking operation in the 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict area. This information leaked out 
of the Council chamber where the question is being debated 
behind closed doors today. 
  Boris Yeltsin's letter to the Federation Council stresses 
that the cessation of hostilities in Abkhazia and the signing of 
a cease-fire agreement and on separating the warring sides was 
achieved through the active involvement of Russia. However, the 
situation in the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict area remains 
"explosive". It has become clear that "without the deployment 
of peacemaking troops it is not possible" to effectively monitor 
observation of the agreements and the return of refugees, the 
letter says. 
  The request to conduct peacekeeping operations in Abkhazia 
is 
contained in appeals by Shevardnadze and Ardzinba to the Russian 
Federation president in his capacity as chairman of the Council 
of CIS Heads of State. Boris Yeltsin's opinion is that 
peacekeeping would conform to the UN standards for this kind of 
action. The CIS heads of states' decision will be conveyed to 
the Security Council, which is being offered a UN observers' 
mission with the peacekeeping forces. It is remembered, the 
letter says, that "the basis for the CIS peacekeeping forces 
will be a reinforced contingent of Russian troops deployed at 
units already located in Georgia." 
  Boris Yeltsin said he hopes that the Federation Council 
"will 
support Russia's peacekeeping efforts within the scope of its 
authority." However, according to preliminary figures, when the 
decision was put to the ballot it gained one vote less than the 
required number.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel Network in Russian at 0800 GMT on 2 June, in its 
"Novosti" newscast, carries a two-minute report by an 
unidentified correspondent that the authorities in the Chechen 
capital, Groznyy, are "earnestly" preparing for the coming talks 
with Moscow. The correspondent says that it is understood in 
Groznyy that disputes with Russia damage the republic's own 
interests. 
  The correspondent goes on to note that the rupture of the 
old 
economic ties have already caused considerable decline in 
production and many enterprises are barely making ends meet. He 
adds that wages cannot be paid because cash is in short supply. 
Nor is the situation likely to change until accounts held in 
the Russian banks were unfrozen, he says, adding that in the 
meantime people are engaging in all kinds of commercial 
activities. He notes that there are many soldiers on the 
streets, because "considerable numbers" are dissatisfied with 
the present regime, as evidenced by the recent attempt on the 
life of Chechen President Dzokhar Dudayev. 
  The report concludes with a brief interview with President 
Dudayev by the reporter. Asked what he personally expects from 
the talks with Moscow, if they take place, President Dudayev 
says: 
  "We expect positive results. Any talks should be positive in 
spirit."

<F P=106> [Nikolay Gritchin report: "From Chechnya Back to Government </F>
in Moscow?"] 
  [Excerpts] Groznyy-Moscow -- The tragic circumstances 
surrounding the attempt on the life of Chechnya's President 
Dzhokhar Dudayev last Friday (during which Chechnya's internal 
affairs minister, his deputy, and his chauffeur died) are linked 
by analysts first and foremost with the authorities' vigorous 
actions to neutralize terrorists. When analyzing the situation 
more profoundly it is necessary to take due account of the fact 
that Russia has confirmed its intention to hold talks with 
Chechnya at the very highest level, even though this aroused the 
discontent of forces opposed to Dudayev. And, last but by no 
means least: Former Supreme Soviet Speaker R. Khasbulatov 
through his actions is declaring ever more ardently that he is a 
true politician, ready to involve himself in Chechen politics. 
  Traces of Former Russian Federation Supreme Soviet Chairman 
R. Khasbulatov's stay in Groznyy are hard to find. It was back 
in mid-April that I spotted the most recent mention of him in 
the leading republic newspaper ICHKERIYA. His trips around the 
republic, his visit to the mosques, the restraint of his 
speeches, and meanderings regarding his intention to stand back 
from the dirty business of politics and move into science, 
clearly placated Dudayev's team, usually extremely politicized 
and wary in respect of opponents. 
  M. Udugov, chief of the republic Department of Information 
and the Press, on the day prior to the 25 May publication in 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA of an interview with the former speaker of 
the Russian Parliament on his return to Moscow, assured me that 
Khasbulatov still remains in Chechnya. While another of 
Dudayev's close comrades in arms resolutely consigned his famous 
compatriot to political oblivion. Obviously he was a little 
premature. Breaking the vow of silence, the erstwhile prisoner 
of Lefortovo gave the current regime in Groznyy an unequivocal 
indication that he will outlive it. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  To the Political Olympus -- In a Roundabout Way </H5>
  The emerging prospects for Khasbulatov's return to power 
cannot fail to alarm the Russian president too. There is an 
awareness in the Kremlin that a second coming to the political 
Olympus by the speaker of the former Supreme Soviet is most 
likely to come via a roundabout route. The post of legitimate 
leader of Chechnya constitutes a sturdy launch pad for a return 
to top-level Russian politics. Experts suggest that, once on 
this platform, Khasbulatov will be able to convince his Chechen 
entourage of the need to sign a treaty with Russia, that he will 
be able to stage elections in the republic for the Russian 
Federation State Duma and Federation Council, present his 
candidacy for the Federation Council, and become a member of it. 
  For B. Yeltsin this would mean an inevitable strengthening 
of 
confrontation in the federal organs of power. The rise of 
national-patriotic sentiment, notably in the deputies' corps, 
makes the prospect of Khasbulatov's being elected Russian 
Federation president or head of the Russian Government unlikely 
in the immediate post-Yeltsin period. But his failure to 
countenance modern-day presidential authority in Moscow, which 
is reliant, to use his expression, "solely on the boys in 
uniform," will probably be exploited by the opposition in order 
to secure victory over Yeltsin and his supporters in future 
elections. 
  Such a prospect, in the opinion of a number of analysts, 
has provided additional impetus for the Kremlin's active quest 
for ways to settle the protracted conflict with Chechnya. The 
"Khasbulatov factor" reinforces preconditions for elaborating a 
mutually acceptable decision at the meeting between the two 
presidents. Experts assert that the Kremlin will probably 
propose several versions of a Russian-Chechen treaty. At the 
same time the Russian-Tatar agreement, which from Dudayev's 
viewpoint is unacceptable to Chechnya, may be seen merely as an 
example to be imitated in the most general sense -- that is, as 
an example of a weighty solution to an insoluble dispute by 
bringing into circulation new political-judicial symbols and 
concepts, allowing the sides to get around discrepancies in 
their positions "without losing face." 
  In particular, national politicians consider it possible for 
Chechnya to devise some kind of status or level of soverienty 
unique in contemporary Russian practice (like the Portuguese 
"free affiliated state"), which, while preserving the external 
attributes of the Republic of Chechnya's state independence 
(with all the concomitant symbols, as is partly taking place 
even in respect of "regular" republics within the Russian 
Federation), would at the same time guarantee the most 
propitious opportunities for Chechnya's reintegration into the 
Russian political and economic area. 
  The implementation of this version, however, presupposes the 
achievement of prior agreement on this question between the two 
branches of power in Moscow, without which the presidential side 
may find itself subject to harsh criticism in the State Duma and 
the Federation Council for "capitulating" and "flouting the 
Constitution." The formation of favorable public opinion both 
in Chechnya and in Russia as regards concluding a compromise 
agreement could be aided by the establishment of close 
cooperation between the internal affairs bodies of the Chechen 
Republic and the Russian Federation in the fight against 
organized crime. The joint arrest of the terrorists who took a 
bus and its passengers hostage in Mineralnyye Vody could be 
considered a good start to this process. Even prior to the 
conclusion of a treaty, the aim could be furthered by a 
guarantee of the safety of rail and road traffic on Chechen 
territory, either by the Chechen authorities on their own or 
jointly with the Russian internal troops, as well as mutual 
guarantees of the safety and equality of the Russian-speaking 
population in Chechnya and the Chechen communities in Russia.

"Troops Approach Chechnya Border"] 
  [Excerpts] The tense situation in Ingushetia and North 
Ossetia has made its presence felt again. Admittedly, this time 
it was not through the recurrent exchanges of gunfire on the 
line of the Ingush-Ossetian confrontation, but in a document 
which came into being in the tranquility of Kremlin offices. 
  The Russian president has recently issued the Edict "On 
Implementing a State of Emergency on Part of the Territories of 
the Republic of North Ossetia and the Republic of Ingushetia." 
[passage omitted] 
  The implementation of a state of emergency, as we know, 
entails the stationing of Russian troops on the territories 
which "come under" the edict. A question arises -- what is the 
main purpose of this act, which affects areas of "enhanced 
peace" rather than "enhanced tension"? Maybe the essence of the 
matter is the common border with Chechnya, where, according to 
the presidential edict, Russian Armed Forces have been 
concentrated since 30 May. Naturally, it would be more 
convenient for the Russian president to conduct talks with D. 
Dudayev, the possibility of which people are talking so much 
about, while keeping Groznyy in sight...

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Ermakova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 2 TASS -- "The strengthening of mutual 
understanding between the Russian Federation and Tatarstan, upon 
which we were relying, was accomplished", according to Tatarstan 
President Mintimer Shaymiyev, now in Moscow in his position as 
delegate to the Federation Council. 
  Responding to an ITAR-TASS question about his main 
conclusions after Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to his 
republic, Shaymiyev said that, after the signing of the 
bilateral treaty between the center and Tatarstan, "peace and 
accord have settled in the republic. And it is very important 
that Boris Nikolayevich (Yeltsin) saw the support for that act 
on peoples' faces". 
  The creation of a bilateral commission headed by the 
Tatarstan leader and Russia's first vice-premier allows the two 
sides to monitor the fulfillment of the treaty's 12 articles, 
Shaymiyev said. He continued on to say that the document makes 
it possible to "develop a conception for the decentralization of 
the federal economy, using the example of Tatarstan, and to 
remove the petty tutelage of the centre". 
  Time has shown that "Tatarstan's economic course, which 
differs somewhat from the federal one, has justified itself", 
the republican president noted. The best indicator of that is 
that "the population has not been impoverished". 
  "The republic's position in the fight against crime has also 
been recognized", Shaymiyev said, explaining that his republic's 
law enforcement bodies are "in control of the situation and have 
overcome their fear of the underworld".

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Nikolay Sorokin] </F>
  [Text] Kazan June 2 TASS -- "The urgent measures to 
stabilise Tatarstan's economy are being taken for the sake of 
our people," Tatar Prime Minister Mukhammat Sabirov told 
ITAR-TASS. Corresponding draft documents have already been 
drawn up by the republic's government and will be submitted for 
approval to the next session of the Tatarstan Supreme Soviet. 
  "These radical measures were prompted by the difficult 
situation in the republic's economy," the premier said. "The 
production slump equalled to almost 30 per cent this year, as 
compared to the corresponding period of 1993, and the figure for 
the defence industry reached 47 per cent. The situation is 
somewhat better only in the agro-industrial sector, where output 
of goods is growing. Vigorous measures were taken to ensure a 
good harvest this year. The government was able to find money to 
pay the wages delayed since January 1944. 
  "The purpose of the urgent measures is to help the strong 
and 
protect the weak," the premier said. "Strong commodity producers 
will be provided with better conditions for increasing the 
output of high-quality goods. The poor sections of the 
population will get differentiated social protection. 
Possessing rich natural resources and a strong scientific and 
technological potential, Tatarstan is able to create every 
condition for the harmonic development of its market, for 
improving the people's living standards," the prime minister 
believes. 
  "Leading economists and financiers have worked for almost 
one 
year on the urgent measures. They have a minimum programme, 
covering the period from 1994 to 1995, and a maximum programme 
for a longer stretch of time. They have drawn on the experience 
of market economies in more than 60 countries, including Turkey, 
China, Germany and the United States. Although no exact 
all-embracing model was found, many parts of the programme are 
based on foreign experience," Sabirov stated.

<F P=106> [Yelena Tregubova report in the "Echo" column: "The Tataria </F>
Public Discusses Yeltsin's Visit. Nationalists Are Unhappy Over 
His Arrival, and Federalists Over His Inattention to Them"] 
  [Text] After Boris Yeltsin's departure from Kazan the 
visit by "the high Moscow guest" continues to be discussed in 
public and political organizations of Tataria. Nationalist 
movements see Yeltsin's coming as a "meeting between Mintimer 
Shaymiyev and the head of a foreign state." For instance, 
Tatarstan Independence Party leader Nazib Galeyev explained to 
SEGODNYA's correspondent: "Yeltsin is the president of a 
neighboring sovereign republic whom we did not really invite and 
who cannot resolve any of our internal problems." Activists of 
the Solidarity committee raise the question about the failure of 
a treaty recently concluded between Moscow and Kazan to 
correspond to Tatarstan's fundamental law and believe that 
contacts with the Russian authorities cannot be pursued until 
after "the treaty has been adjusted to the republic 
constitution." 
  The Tatarstan Republican Party, although it finds that 
treaty 
"infringes Tatarstan's interests," nonetheless considers Boris 
Yeltsin's visit not useless "in light of budget infusions he 
promised." Ruzal Yusupov, leader of Tatar republicans, 
complained that "now the question is only how much Tatarstan 
will get, for instance, from KamAZ [motor works] which Yeltsin 
promised to help." 
  The bloc of "federalist" parties Equality and Legality -- as 
local representatives of Russia's Choice call themselves, the 
Democratic Party of Russia, the People's Party of Free Russia 
(which has dissociated itself from Rutskoy and Lipitskiy and 
intends to affiliate with Gaydar) and also the Accord movement, 
hoped during Yeltsin's visit to "draw Moscow's attention to the 
fact that Tatarstan is being ruled by a union of old party 
nomenklatura and the national elite." On the day of 
negotiations between Presidents Yeltsin and Shaymiyev the 
"federalists" staged pickets at the walls of the Kazan Kremlin 
and then used mass media to protest the fact that the Russian 
president "did not wish to meet with any representatives of the 
independent public." 
  Virtually all political organizations of Tataria stated 
their 
discontent with Boris Yeltsin's "limited scope of meetings" in 
Kazan. A leader of the Russian Federation Citizens movement, 
Vasiliy Barabash, who is senior inspector at the Lenin district 
division of the Kazan City Internal Affairs Directorate, said 
that plainclothes police were instructed on the day of Boris 
Yeltsin's arrival to snatch placards from the pickets of 
democratic organizations. According to the inspector, "security 
forces from all areas around Kazan and all special task and 
militia forces were brought into the city to make sure that 
everywhere Yeltsin moves would be through a narrow corridor, 
without communicating with the public." Conversations with 
"grass-roots citizens," according to Vasiliy Barabash, were 
organized in places specially designated by the authorities, 
"with people prepared in advance." Republican leader Ruzal 
Yusupov said he was sure that "if the Russian leader really 
wanted to learn about the actual situation in the republic, he 
would not have gone exclusively to show-piece sovkhozes, in the 
old tradition of the stagnation era." "This cannot be helped: 
Traditions are traditions; after all they are all party people," 
Ruzal Yusupov concluded in a conversation with SEGODNYA's 
correspondent.

"Miners Striking Again"] 
  [Text] Miners in the Baykal and Transbaykal areas stopped 
mining and dispatching fuel to consumers yesterday. With the 
exception of workers at two opencut mines, the 20,000-strong 
collective of the "Vostsibugol" joint-stock company is insisting 
on immediate payment of debts which now amount to approximately 
170 billion rubles [R]. The principal debtors are power 
industry workers, specifically in Khabarovsk and Maritime Krays. 
However, the list of demands put forward by the miners is 
topped by an appeal to the Russian Federation Government, which 
they say should allocate funds to pay off debts of R69 billion 
run up by budget-financed and other organizations 
  In accordance with a statement made by Vladimir Solomin, 
chairman of the joint-stock company strike committee, the strike 
action is scheduled to last for three days and also has a 
political angle: The East Siberian miners are demanding the 
resignation of the government and early presidential elections.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Tereshchenko of Moscow City Hall Press </F>
Center: "Do You Want to Become a Muscovite? Then Pay Up!"] 
  [Text] The Moscow government has issued a decree "On the 
Taxation of Citizens Coming To Live in Moscow." The authorities 
have decided to take this step on the basis of the following 
fact (and, as we know, facts are stubborn things): Thousands of 
new arrivals who have bought themselves Moscow accommodations in 
recent years are, one way or another, living in the capital 
without a permit. The situation clearly cannot be rectified by 
countermeasures in the old "Stalinist" spirit, and that is 
obvious to everyone. City Mayor Yu. Luzhkov tilted the balance 
in favor of a civilized approach by ratifying a procedure for 
examining questions of the registration of foreign citizens in 
housing space which belongs to them on the basis of ownership 
rights. 
  Now, as of 1 June, it is planned to introduce this type of 
tax for people arriving from regions of the Russian Federation 
(with the exception of Moscow Oblast) and from foreign countries 
near and far to live permanently in Moscow. According to the 
document, the money paid by people coming from other cities will 
go into compensating expenditure on Muscovites' material and 
consumer facilities and other items of expenditure. 
  The Moscow government has determined three categories of 
taxpayer: Russian Federation citizens; citizens of CIS 
countries; and foreign citizens and people with no citizenship. 
Correspondingly, there are three rates of taxation: an amount 
equivalent to 500 times the monthly minimum wage established by 
the Russian Federation law for Russian Federation citizens; 
1,000 times for CIS citizens; and 2,500 times for foreigners and 
people without citizenship. However, the authorities have not 
ruled out the right to fix a preferential taxation rate. Only 
the Moscow government commission for housing questions, permits, 
and discharges can grant this right -- if there are valid 
reasons. 
  A "new-fledged Muscovite" will have to pay the taxes on his 
own initiative, via banking or any other Moscow credit 
institutions. 
  One small thing is lacking: The Moscow City Duma has yet to 
give the go-ahead for the imposition of the tax as of 1 June or 
ratify the Moscow City draft law "On a Targeted Tax for 
Compensating City Budget Expenditure on the Development of the 
City's Infrastructure and Provision for Social and Living 
Conditions of Citizens Coming to Moscow City." 
  What does the draft law deal with? 
  The owner of housing space (individual) and members of his 
family with whom he (they) has been registered before arriving 
in Moscow will receive the right of registration in Moscow 
(permit). 
  At the same time, the housing space acquired as property 
must 
be located in buildings which are not subject to evacuation in 
connection with demolition or reconstruction, and must 
correspond to the established housing standard of at least 9 
square meters of housing space for each member of a family. 
Incidentally, the payment of the city tax for the right of 
registration (permit) in Moscow does not entail any commitments 
on the part of the municipal housing department or other housing 
organs in terms of the allocation of housing space to people who 
come from other cities.

<F P=106> [Interview with Novosibirsk Oblast Procurator Vladimir </F>
Tokarev by VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK correspondent Irina Timofeyeva; 
place and date not given: "The Procuracy Never Handed Out 
Gingerbread..."] 
  [Text] Last year Novosibirsk Oblast Procuracy 
investigators referred to courts 869 criminal cases, of which 
more than half concerned premeditated murders. It oversees the 
investigation of more than 100,000 criminal cases. The procuracy 
filed with the courts 1,347 claims for compensation for damages; 
about 1,000 of them on behalf of the state, and the rest--on 
behalf of individuals. Over four months of this year 14 cases in 
the economic sphere alone, involving a total amount of 1.624 
billion rubles [R], were referred to the arbitration court. Some 
of them have been considered and resolved. 
  These figures were given to our correspondent at the 
oblast procuracy shortly before the date when this state body 
celebrated its 72d anniversary--counting only the Soviet period. 
I think it is more correct to count its age since the time of 
Peter the Great, who created the procuracy at the beginning of 
the 18th century. The anniversary provided a pretext for asking 
Novosibirsk Oblast Procurator Vladimir Vasilyevich Tokarev a few 
questions. 
  [Timofeyeva] Recent events are such that one gets the 
impression that there are forces trying if not destroy then at 
least to weaken the Russian procuracy. 
  [Tokarev] Our function is to uphold the laws currently in 
effect. The procuracy cannot be everybody's favorite because it 
has never handed out gingerbread. The wave of criticism over the 
past few years, some of which was fair, was inevitable 
considering our history. It is quite possible that not everybody 
is happy with the very existence of an oversight body. Remember, 
just recently it was only through Kazannik's incredible efforts 
that the article on the procuracy was literally rammed through 
in the new constitution. 
  [Timofeyeva] What is actually happening with general 
procurators? What is the view from here, from the provinces? 
  [Tokarev] I know no more than you do--mainly what I read in 
the press. My opinion is that Stepankov, although he was young 
when he came into this job, had already earned authority and 
respect by then. He turned out to be a mature leader and did 
much to preserve and strengthen the procuracy. Kazannik is a 
highly educated, intelligent, and decent man, but not versed in 
political games. His problem was that he looked at life from the 
university chair viewpoint. As to what is next--we will see... 
In principle, no matter who is at the top we have to carry out 
our duty here. 
  [Timofeyeva] It is bad taste these days to quote Lenin. 
Still, I will take a chance and quote a famous phrase: "...there 
cannot be a Kaluga legality and a Kazan legality--there) should 
be one, all-Russia legality..." How topical is this idea today? 
  [Tokarev] I would say it is very topical. We live in a 
rapidly developing society. The new constitution says that krays 
and oblasts have the right to carry out their own legal 
regulation, including adopting laws. Apparently in the desire to 
make full use of this right the oblast council adopted a plan 
for legislative work. It envisages the adoption of nearly 40 
different laws and decrees over a short period of time. Without 
belittling in any way the merits and abilities of the new deputy 
corps, I will dare to voice a certain doubt. I think that some 
deputies have a somewhat simplistic idea of the lawmaking 
process. The adoption of any law, even one limited to the 
oblast, requires quite lengthy and painstaking work. Another 
example. Currently the oblast administration, concerned at the 
way the situation is developing, is preparing a number of 
documents on matters of combating crime, stabilizing the 
economic situation, and others. Looking at some of them brings 
one to the conclusion that the authors attempt to resolve the 
accumulated problems by strong-arm, proscriptive methods, 
disregarding first of all current federal legislation. It is not 
good when each rayon begins to write its own "constitution." We, 
at least, do not expect an easy life. 
  [Timofeyeva] This means that the role of your agency will 
grow. And what are your relations with the judiciary? In 
particular, with respect to appeals on arrests? 
  [Tokarev] We have normal businesslike relations. Over more 
or 
less the past year and a half we have been preparing our staff 
for the competitiveness of the process, since the procurator's 
role in court will be somewhat different. With respect to 
appeals of arrests, a law has been adopted and it has to be 
complied with. There can be no argument about this. The courts 
do it, albeit not without mistakes. Now we are sorting out the 
situation, trying first and foremost to identify our own 
shortcomings. A serious oversight on the part of lawmakers is 
the impossibility of appealing such a court decision. 
  [Timofeyeva] Vladimir Vasilyevich, what kind of crimes worry 
you most? 
  [Tokarev] The number of so-called everyday murders keeps 
growing. In 1992 there were 134 of them in the oblast; last year 
there were 220, and 89 have already been committed over four 
months of this year. One can pontificate endlessly on the causes 
of everyday murders: apathy, bitterness, drinking, loss of the 
old forms of social work--which was not all that bad--with 
problem families. Very troublesome is the increase in the number 
of grave crimes against individuals motivated by greed. In April 
we opened a case on the murder of an Armenian family, including 
a four-year-old girl. A large sum of money had disappeared. The 
professionalism of the Dzerzhinskiy Rayon Department of Internal 
Affairs staff and their close interaction with oblast procuracy 
investigators produced results: Two weeks ago a suspect, also an 
Armenian, was detained and charged. 
  [Timofeyeva] What about economic crime? 
  [Tokarev] We are investigating, for instance, the case of 
the 
director of GPI [state design institute] Sibgiproelektro and his 
deputy, who are charged with extorting bribes for leasing space. 
So far the amounts involved are R3 million and $2,000. We 
recently referred to court a case that had been reported in the 
press, including by your newspaper. I mean the attempt to 
solicit a large bribe by the deputy chief of the oblast state 
trade inspectorate; she is also charged with embezzlement. 
Investigation is also underway in the case of employees of the 
Rosstrakh joint-stock company's security service. In order to 
"collect" debts, they took hostages. There have been instances 
of theft of arms and ammunition from military 
warehouses--handguns, ammunition, and dynamite sticks were 
stolen. Ten persons have been charged, eight of whom are under 
arrest. 
  Speaking of the economy, I am concerned at the artificial 
washout of state property. For instance, in the total property 
of an enterprise converted to joint-stock holding only 5 percent 
belongs to physical persons, and the rest--to the state. 
Nevertheless, currently the lawmaker in the event of theft 
treats the entire property as private. The role of the state is 
falling. But we all know that if the state is strong, life will 
become easier for all its citizens--stockholders, entrepreneurs, 
and workers...

  [Text] Our reporter has learned that the Belarusian 
Embassy addressed the U.S. National Defense Council on 31 May 
requesting confirmation that U.S. strategic missiles are no 
longer aimed at Belarus. The request was prompted by the fact 
that the U.S.-Russian declaration of 14 January 1994 confirmed 
the intention of the presidents of the two states to discontinue 
aiming their strategic missiles by 30 May 1994. The State 
Department confirmed to the embassy that the aiming of all U.S. 
strategic missiles had been discontinued, including those aimed 
at Belarus, from whose territory Russian strategic missiles are 
currently being withdrawn. Our reporter points out that this is 
an important step toward definite elimination of the traces of 
the Cold War.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report in the "Mass Media" column: "A </F>
Political Gag. All Avenues to Readers and Listeners Have Been 
Cut Off to Opposition Belorussian Journalists"] 
  [Text] The management of a number of opposition mass media 
of Belorussia [Belarus] have been advised about the 
impossibility of their further functioning. The Belorussian 
Press House, for instance, told Igor Germenchuk, editor of 
SVOBODA weekly, that it will not publish his paper while the 
Ministry of Communications will not disseminate it through its 
channels. Germenchuk received no official explanation, but he 
is sure that corresponding orders to the Press House and the 
Ministry of Communications have come from the Belorussian 
Council of Ministers. According to the editor, such 
ill-considered action by government structures has been prompted 
by the publication in SVOBODA's latest issue of a letter from a 
soldier who told about his participation in servicing a hunting 
spree by republic Prime Minister Vyacheslaw Kebich and his 
retinue. 
  Under the pretext of reorganizing the Belorussian National 
TV 
and Radio Company, two radio stations broadcasting on the state 
radio wire network -- Belorusskaya Molodezhnaya and Krinitsa -- 
have been closed. These facts are not an exception but the 
regular attitude by Belorussian official authorities to 
independent mass media. It should be recalled that independent 
TV companies were not granted the right to broadcast on Channel 
8 only until their leadership undertook not to "air any 
politics." Attempts were made to close Belorussian private news 
agency BELAPAN. After the agency reported a statement by 
people's deputy Aleksandr Lukashenko about contacts between top 
state officials and representatives of the mafia, a ban was 
imposed on using BelaPAN information on the radio. A little 
more than a month ago the Information Ministry annulled the 
registration certificate of newspaper NOVOSTI BELORUSSKOGO 
NARODNOGO FRONTA.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 105 (595) by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy and edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] The election campaign officially began in Belarus on 
Thursday, June 2, to last until June 22, one day before 
elections to choose the republic's first president. 
  There are six contestants in the election race: the Agrarian 
Party's leader Aleksandr Dubko, the Prime Minister Vyacheslav 
Kebich, the former chief of an ad hoc anti-corruption 
parliamentary commission Aleksandr Lukashenko, the Communist 
Party's Secretary Vasiliy Novikov, the Popular Front's leader 
Zenon Poznyak, and the ex-parliament's speaker Stanislav 
Shushkevich. 
  They received their certificates of candidates at a formal 
ceremony on Wednesday. In keeping with Belarusian legislation, 
all of them have equal material, technical, and financial 
opportunities in the election campaign, during which they can be 
relieved of their office duties with their pay to be retained, 
and so can be their canvassers. Each candidate is entitled to 
up to 20 canvassers. 
  A nominee has the right to a free fare for all means of 
transportation but taxi. He cannot be persecuted, arrested or 
detained without the Central Election Committee's consent. 
  Local observers rate Kebich's election chances as best and 
refer to the outcome of the last poll, in which more than 68 
percent of respondents favoured a president that must support 
monetary integration with Russia by all means. As is known, 
Kebich is the initiator and consistent advocate of such an 
alliance. In his last interview with Interfax he plainly 
declared that if he won presidential elections, he would press 
for putting the monetary integration agreement with Russia into 
effect. 
  Analyzing what has helped Kebich's team to prevail at the 
first stage of the election race, opposition experts point to 
the active role played in his election campaign by state central 
and local authorities. 
  Meanwhile, the Popular Front's leader Poznyak has no doubt 
in 
his victory, as his canvassers have declared at a 
news-conference recently. They reminded journalists that 
Poznyak had collected 230,000 signatures, the second best result 
after Kebich. As Poznyak himself told newsmen, "although local 
authorities resisted the collection of signatures for an 
opposition candidate, he has enlisted more support for himself 
than all other candidates in Minsk and some other industrial 
centers." 
  However, as observers believe, his chances to win are slim. 
According to the election poll, 61 percent of the electorate 
believe that a president must not represent any political force, 
and nearly 60 percent of respondents wished that a head of state 
be a centrist. 
  Although the election campaign was launched on Thursday, 
contestants had already exposed their views on the key issues in 
the press and in public statements. For instance, Kebich 
outlined his election program in an exclusive interview with 
Interfax (see the Presidential Bulletin of June 1). 
  The Communist Party's nominee Vasiliy Novikov promises, if 
elected, to do away with vouchers as means to privatize people's 
homes and businesses since, in his opinion, such privatization 
"has never justified itself." 
  He has told an Interfax correspondent that he "does not rule 
out alliance with any candidate but Shushkevich and Poznyak, if 
he goes through into the second round of elections." 
  He argues that "Belarus had the highest sovereignty only 
within the Soviet Union." He also reported that "the Belarusian 
Communist Party currently unites more than 25,000 people and has 
branches in virtually all parts of the country." 
  "For ethical reasons," he did not name a candidate to the 
post of prime minister in the event of his election victory, but 
noted that the composition of the current cabinet and parliament 
be preserved as much as possible. IF Note: As Shushkevich 
earlier told Interfax, should he win presidential elections, his 
cabinet be taken over by the National Bank's Chairman Stanislav 
Bogdankevich. As is known, Bogdankevich has been repeatedly 
censured by lawmakers and government officials for his 
opposition to monetary unity with Russia and for some of his 
decisions, including the May 18 National Bank's decision to 
recognize "hares" (national banknotes) as the only legal tender 
in Belarus pending monetary integration with Russia.

  [Text] Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich's 
political popularity has doubled, officials at the Belarusian 
Political Research Center Eridan announced today. 
  Kebich leads the list of the officially registered 
candidates 
to the post of president with 372,000 signatures in support of 
his candidacy. 
  Ex-speaker of the Belarusian parliament Stanislav 
Shushkevich 
and leader of the Agrarian Party Aleksandr Dubko secured the 
smallest number of signatures (123,000 and 117,000, 
respectively). The other candidates are former head of the 
temporary parliamentary commission for combating corruption 
Aleksandr Lukashenko, Secretary of the Communist Party's Central 
Committee Vassiliy Novikov and leader of the Popular Front Zenon 
Poznyak. 
  An opinion poll held by the Eridan Center revealed that the 
popularity of Lukashenko, Novikov and Dubko has increased from 2 
to 4 percent since April, while that of Shushkevich has gone 
down from 9.8 to 7.1 percent and Poznyak -- from 5.4 to 4 
percent. 
  The same poll showed that 57.8 percent of the respondents 
welcome the unification of the Russian and Belarusian monetary 
systems, and 77.7 percent favored the creation of a 
Belarusian-Russian financial and economic union.

  [Text] If Vasil Novikaw, secretary of the Central 
Committee of the Party of Communists of Belarus [PKB], wins the 
presidential election, certain economic reforms will be halted 
-- namely, the privatization of housing and industrial 
enterprises by means of vouchers. This was stated by Syarhey 
Kalyakin, secretary of the PKB Central Committee, at a news 
conference held by the PKB leadership. According to Kalyakin, 
Vasil Novikaw will participate in the first round of the 
elections -- this has been decided by the PKB Central Committee. 
Kalyakin also noted that "if the situation changes, it will not 
be ruled out that Novikaw could form a bloc with one of the 
following three candidates -- Kebich, Dubko, or Lukashenka. 
Such a bloc is by no means possible with Paznyak or Shushkevich. 
  Commenting on the slogan of his presidential campaign -- "To 
return to the people that which they have been deprived" -- 
Vasil Novikaw stated that "in the first place, it is necessary 
to restore social guarantees and rights which were achieved 
during the Soviet period. It is necessary to return to a great, 
powerful state, great friendship among the people, and real 
people's democracy." The presidential candidate called the 
presidency "a foreign body in Slav civilization" and noted that 
given a victory of left forces at the presidential and 
parliamentary elections, it would be quite possible to propose 
eliminating the presidency. Novikaw stated that as of today, he 
has almost completed his team for changing the current 
government in the event of his election victory. However, 
according to Novikaw, even now, the government includes 
"specialists and honest people whom we know and will keep at 
their posts."

  [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has said that the 
methods pursued so far on the Cyprus issue have not yielded any 
results, adding that the time has come to try a new approach. 
Demirel said: A reasonable solution is being sought. A 
reasonable solution cannot be found by making territorial 
concessions as well as concessions involving the flag. Yavuz 
Yorulmaz reports from Kishinev: 
  [Begin Yorulmaz recording] Demirel, who is in Moldova on an 
official visit, held a news conference yesterday evening and 
assessed his contacts. He also replied to reporters' question 
on foreign policy. In reply to a question on Cyprus, Demirel 
said that the Cyprus problem cannot be solved through the recent 
report prepared by the UN secretary general. He added: There 
have been many similar reports in the past. What is being 
sought? It is a bizonal and bicommunal federation. The 
Butrus-Ghali report states that this method has so far not 
yielded any results. A bizonal and a bicommunal Cyprus solution 
is not yielding any results. As was the case prior to 1963, if 
you try and bring together two peoples with separate languages, 
religions, and cultures in a world where federations are 
crumbling will the problem be solved? 
  Demirel also described as unjust the fact that the Western 
countries have so far failed to recognize the Turkish Republic 
of Northern Cyprus. He added that the 150,000 Turkish Cypriots 
living on the island have been isolated and that no results have 
been achieved from the efforts exerted within the framework of 
the United Nations. Demirel said: This is the case because 
they want the flag as well as territorial concessions. When you 
give both away then you cannot explain such a solution to 
anyone. Demirel noted that the Cyprus solution should be 
acceptable to the Turkish Cypriot people. He added: The 
methods pursued so far have not yielded any results. The time 
has come to try a new method. 
  Assessing his visit, Demirel said that his contacts in 
Ukraine and Moldova was aimed at seeking cooperation between 
Turkey and these countries. Pointing out that during his 
contacts he also found the opportunity to discuss the situation 
of the Crimean Tatars and the Gagauz Turks, Demirel said that no 
one should be concerned that these issues have been included on 
Turkey's agenda. Demirel noted that Turkey has a historic 
responsibility toward the Crimean Tatars and the Gagauz Turks, 
adding that it will be appropriate to extend financial and moral 
support to these peoples. Demirel added: Turkey is obliged to 
act in line with the requirements of a great state. Pointing 
out that Turkey should not give the impression that it is 
exhausted in the face of its problems, Demirel said: Turkey 
will continue on its path and will solve its difficulties. New 
possibilities and means of cooperation will be created. Turkey 
will continue its growth and prosperity in stability. 
  In reply to a question, Demirel said that his visit has 
generated a lot of interest in the foreign press, adding that it 
has raised the question of what Turkey is aiming at. Pointing 
out that Turkey is an independent country whose policies are not 
mortgaged and which maintains friendly relations with its 
neighbors, Demirel added: We do not pursue policies of enmity. 
In other words, our bilateral relations do not, in any way, 
pose a threat to a third country. 
  Demirel said that Turkish entrepreneurs precede the state in 
investing in regional countries. He added that a risk insurance 
system should be developed with the aim of guaranteeing these 
investments. Pointing out that the loans extended by Turkey 
through Exim Bank are clumsy and inept, Demirel added that 
devising a new loan system will encourage investments. 
  Demirel will conclude his contacts in Moldova today. He will 
inaugurate the temporary building of the Turkish Embassy in 
Kishinev and attend the signing ceremony of various bilateral 
agreements. Demirel will then hold a joint news conference with 
Moldovan President Mircea Snegur and assess his visit. He will 
also visit a winery near Kishinev and leave for Ankara this 
evening. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>
  [Text] Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has stated 
that the UN secretary general's recent Cyprus report shows that 
the organization lacks the patience necessary at this time, when 
the Turkish Cypriots are making sacrifices toward an agreement. 
Cetin said that the report will not help secure an agreement on 
the confidence-building measures [CBM] package. 
  Cetin held a news conference in Moldova, where President 
Suleyman Demirel is conducting an official visit, and assessed 
the report. TRT correspondent Kemal Gungordu reports from 
Kishinev: 
  [Begin recording] [Gungordu] Cetin stated that it is unfair 
and unjust for the United Nations to blame the Turkish Cypriot 
side for not having political will. Cetin stressed that in this 
way, the United Nations is striving to avoid and rid itself of 
the issue. Cetin continued: 
  [Cetin] It is obvious that such an approach will not 
contribute to a positive development regarding the Cyprus issue. 
The United Nations, which is in no hurry to reach decisions on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and other places in the world where bloody 
incidents are taking place, took a harmful course when it issued 
this report without awaiting the conclusion of the CBM talks in 
Cyprus, which had embarked on a favorable course, and thereby 
failed to exhibit even the patience necessary for a solution. 
  [Gungordu] Noting that this is his initial assessment of the 
report, Cetin added that he will have a more detailed 
announcement to make once he reviews the particulars of the 
report. In answer to a reporter's question, Cetin noted: I 
must admit that the UN secretary general has failed to fulfill 
his goodwill mission with this report. In the report, Cetin 
noted, the UN secretary general creates the impression, without 
actually naming names, that he blames the Turkish Republic of 
Northern Cyprus [TRNC] for being the party that is not 
interested in conciliation. Pointing out that in his report, 
the secretary general mentions the impossibility of making 
changes in the CBM's, Cetin added: They, however, are the ones 
who made the changes. 
  Explaining that the CBM's were put forward on 1 July 1993, 
Cetin recalled that President Rauf Denktas had announced his 
acceptance of the package. Indicating that the package that 
emerged on 21 March, when the talks started, differed on five 
basic points from the secretary general's initial package. Cetin 
continued: 
  [Cetin] One of these points was related to the map of Maras 
[Varosha], the second to arrangements regarding access to Maras, 
the third to establishing two separate customs at Lefkosa 
[Nicosia] Airport and to the landing of Turkish planes, that is 
to say, TRNC planes. All of these points, which were under 
consideration were changed in the document they put forward on 
21 March, and all of these changes are in the Greek Cypriot 
Administration's favor. Actually, they are the ones who made the 
changes. 
  [Gungordu] Cetin reiterated that the TRNC submitted 
legitimate requests when confronted with changes that favored 
the other party. Pointing out that the TRNC requests were 
discussed in the Vienna talks, where certain arrangements were 
formulated, Cetin added: 
  [Cetin] This report was released when the discussions were 
continuing. It is clear -- and this is pure speculation and is 
not based on anything concrete -- that when it became obvious 
that the items agreed on in Vienna would probably be 
unacceptable to the Greek Cypriot side and before that point was 
reached, it was decided to issue this report, which portrays the 
TRNC as the side not interested in conciliation. This is 
totally unjust and unacceptable. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Knyazkov: "Two Banks of One River. </F>
Dniester Region and Moldavia at Negotiating Table"] 
  [Text] As you know, the meetings in April between the 
president of Moldavia [Moldova] and the Dniester Moldavian 
[Moldovan] Republic ended with the signing of a statement in the 
presence of representatives of the CSCE and the Russian 
president, which speaks of the need to resolve all contentious 
issues solely by means of talks and by peaceful means alone. 
Mircea Snegur and Igor Smirnov agreed on the need to define the 
state-legal status of the Dniester Region as well as the need 
for a phased program to establish and implement state-legal 
relations and delegate and demarcate the sides' powers. 
  The latest meeting at expert level is now in preparation. 
But Mircea Snegur believes that the talks will nonetheless be 
hard. Kishinev [Chisinau] is considering defining the status of 
the Dniester Region within the framework of a single state. 
Especially since the statement signed by the two presidents is 
based on the principle of the unity and territorial integrity of 
the Republic of Moldova. Tiraspol has not as yet revealed its 
view of the state-legal status of its unrecognized republic. 
But, in Mircea Snegur's opinion, the DMR wants more -- 
federalization or even confederalization. Incidentally, this 
conclusion is prompted by the Dniester Moldavian Republic's 
support for the idea of legalizing unrecognized states put 
forward by Robert Kocharyan, chairman of the Nagorno-Karabakh 
State Defense Committee. 
  It is also obvious that Russia's position will still 
particularly influence the settlement of the Dniester problem. 
Incidentally, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has learned that the latest ninth 
round of Russian-Moldavian talks on the status of the Russian 
Army in Moldavia will be held in Moscow 7-8 June 1994. As you 
know, progress at these talks depends completely on Moldavia's 
granting the Dniester Region state-legal status.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetsky] </F>
  [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] 2 June TASS -- The delay in 
handing over Dniester coupons, the unit of local currency, is a 
well-planned action by Moscow and Kishinev with an aim to exert 
pressure upon the Dniester region at the talks on the withdrawal 
of Russia's 14th Army, Dniester leader Igor Smirnov told today a 
meeting of bankers and local government officials in the 
regional capital Tiraspol. 
  Speaker of the Dniester local parliament Grigoriy Marakutsa 
returned on Thursday from a business trip to Moscow, where he 
failed to settle the coupon issue with Russian authorities. The 
coupons were printed late last year at Russia's Goznak mint on 
Tiraspol's order and cost the region 1.5 billion Russian 
roubles. The move was prompted by Moldova's decision to 
introduce its own national currency, the lei, which the Dniester 
authorities refused to recognize and ordered to keep Soviet 
roubles in circulation. This sent inlfation soaring and brought 
the regional economy on the verge of collapse. 
  In addition to it, the situation changed considerably 
following last October's events in Moscow. Seeking not to sour 
relations with Moldova, the Russian leadership decided to hold 
up the transfer of the coupons to Tiraspol. Early this year, 
Russia's supreme arbitration court ruled to satisfy the claim of 
the Dniester region and obliged the manufacturer to hand over 
the coupons to the customer. However, this has not been done so 
far. 
  According to well-informed sources in Tiraspol, Moscow 
demands that the Dniester leadership coordinate its actions with 
Kishinev. The Moldovan authorities believe that Dniester's own 
currency will complicate the process of settlement, which is 
expected to be discussed at next week's round of 
Moldovan-Dniester talks. The talks will be mediated by the 
Russian president's special envoy Vladlen Vasev.

  [Text] Sources close to the head of state told INTERFAX 
that President Nursultan Nazarbayev was drafting a message he 
intended to read to parliament next week on resolving the 
political crisis in the country. 
  The crisis was brought to a head when the Supreme Soviet 
declared it had no confidence in the government's socioeconomic 
and legal policies. The document said that while making noises 
about building a market economy the government essentially 
obstructed the market reform and had triggered an economic chaos 
in the country. Parliament also thought that the government had 
not worked a society consolidating program. 
  To avoid complete paralysis of the authority parliament 
suggested "a constructive dialog between all branches of power 
and public and political organizations leading to a national 
reform program and formation of a government capable of 
implementing the program." 
  A government official told INTERFAX that the government knew 
what to do and was capable of doing it. He said that the 
Tereshchenko government has a specific anti-crisis program that 
was being adapted to the situation in the wake of the 
introduction of a national currency. The official was critical 
of parliament which, he said, had failed to adopt numerous bills 
on oil, transportation and finances and thus obstructed 
investments in the Republic's economy. 
  The press secretary of Tereshchenko described the parliament 
declaration as unconstitutional. In a statement made public in 
Almaty he emphasized that under the Constitution the government 
had to report only to the president.

  [Excerpts] [No dateline as received] -- Education Minister 
Yerezhep Mambetkaziyev held a news conference devoted to the 
situation in the education system and its future development. 
All these painful topical problems in our education system were 
described in an appeal to the Supreme Kenges deputies. The 
appeal contains a concept of the education reform on all levels. 
It is a matter of prestige for the new parliament to give total 
support for national education. 
  It was stated that today, more than ever before, it is 
necessary to take legal measures to actively protect and support 
education. Laws should aim at establishment of a common 
educational space within the framework of the CIS 
Interparliamentary Assembly. 
  It is an open secret that economic problems have badly 
affected the preschool educational system. It is here that 
formation of new citizens begins. However, hundreds of 
nurseries are closed down, about 60 percent of children have no 
access to these institutions, and their parents do not receive 
reimbursement. Against the background of the overall economic 
trouble the most problematic issues are organization of the 
study process, of nourishment and every day consumer services 
for children and teenagers. During the previous three years 
enrollment to technical vocational schools decreased by one 
third, and the number of unemployed graduates increased by a 
factor of eight. Some of these youngsters are employed in 
commerce, and others are idle, which means they can potentially 
join the criminal world. 
  The prestige and priority of education are impossible 
without 
social protection for educational establishments, their staff 
and students, without financial help. Hopes are pinned on local 
budgets. The state does not allocate sufficient money for 
education. Over 25,000 teachers need home improvement. They 
lose hope and quit -- only last year over 30,000 teachers left 
the education field, and today schools need over 17,000 teachers. 
  The reform, which will help to overcome the crisis envisages 
a better budgeting from the state and support for nonstate 
budgeting of schools, vocational schools, and nurseries. Some 
of the vocational schools will be transformed into colleges, or 
technical lyceums, and their graduates will have bachelors' 
degrees. The reform envisages a multilevel structure, a new 
mechanism for giving jobs to graduates and setting up of a 
research institute of the higher school problems. 
  The journalists were particularly interested in a new system 
of comprehensive testing prior to enrollment to universities. 
On 26 July for the first ever time all universities of Almaty 
will give tests checked by computers, so as to exclude lack of 
objectivity and nepotism. [passage omitted] 
  The Importance of a new information technology, intensive 
methods of teaching, as well as of the trilingual principle 
(Kazakh, Russian, and foreign languages) and enhancement of 
training in social and liberal arts was stressed at the news 
conference. 
  Over 3,000 Kazakhstanis are currently educated abroad. These 
are talented children who merit the elite-type education. In 
future, the network of elite-type educational institutions will 
be increased, and computer databases will be created to find out 
talented young people.

  [Text] Last year experts of Kazakhstan's customs 
confiscated around 10 kg of drugs from passengers, and over a 
period of four months of the current year they have seized 133 
kg. This fact was quoted during a roundtable discussion 
organized by law enforcement bodies at Almaty's friendship 
house. Drugs made of hemp from the Chu valley are smuggled to 
neigboring and distant countries. 
  By using modern methods of checking luggage and cargo our 
customs is trying to block illegal channels. It uses 40 
specially trained dogs for this and their number will soon be 
increased to 100 [words indistinct]. Foreign drug mafia has 
contributed to the seriousness of the situation that has 
developed in Kazakhstan. The relevant UN departments are 
worried about this. A group of its representatives, led by the 
deputy secretary general and the director of the UN program for 
control over drugs, Giorgio Giacomelli, who were on a visit to 
Almaty, urged the participants in the roundtable discussion to 
join efforts in combatting it. 
  Leaders of ministries of internal affairs and agriculture, 
the National Security Committee, procuracy and other departments 
put forward a number of proposals on this issue. In particular, 
they think it is important to set up a Kazakhstan committee for 
combatting drugs and drug smuggling.

  [Summary] Almaty has a great chance of becoming one of the 
most polluted capitals in the world in the near future. This 
sad fact was stated by Bulat Yesekin, the head of the city 
directorate for ecology and bioresources in an interview with 
our correspondent. The state has not allocated any money for the 
improvement of Almaty's ecology either in the current or last 
year. Even the external budgeting fund for protection of 
nature, which used to finance several important programs, will 
be used by the government for other purposes. 
  The city needs new roads and traffic controls because the 
number of cars in the capital increases annually by a third. 
The quality of gas leaves much to be desired. The life of 
catalysts, which were used to purify car exhausts, expire very 
quickly nowadays. The city has two power engineering units that 
are very unsafe ecologically. 
  The president of the Republic issued an edict last year on 
urgent measures for the development of Almaty, in conformity 
with which the Ministry of Power Engineering and Fuel Resources 
was to provide its Almaty enterprises with low-ash coal and 
low-sulphur fuel oil, but the only thing that the ministry has 
done is to persuade the government to set flexible norms of air 
pollution. This has only worsened the situation. 
  The city and the oblast do not have special sites for 
storing 
toxic waste. The recycling of garbage needs improvement. 
  These problems become even more topical in view of the 
mountains surrounding the city. Our capital has no natural 
ventilation. Currently, Almaty leads as a city with the most 
polluted air in the republic, ranking second to Leninogorsk, 
which is the largest industrial center. It is not by chance 
that the population in Almaty ranks second to no one in the 
number of diseases of the respiratory, cardio-vascular, nervous, 
and urino-genital systems. Their health is also affected by the 
fact that the soil in the city and subsoil waters are noxious.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F>
Vladimir Taranov] 
  [Text] Moscow, 2 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- The Russian side will 
not remain aloof and will undertake jointly with the official 
Tajik authorities all the necessary measures in order that those 
guilty of crimes will be punished. This was said at a briefing 
today by Grigoriy Karasin, director of the information and press 
department of the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry, in 
connection with the killing of Colonel Yuriy Shkipkin, deputy 
chief of troops of the Tajikistan Defense Ministry, in Dushanbe. 
  "There is no doubt," he stressed, "that forces that aim at 
further aggravating the situation in the country, which is 
already uneasy as it is, are behind the latest crime. It is no 
accident that first and foremost it is servicemen, especially 
ethnic Russians, who are carrying out their duty to help to 
restore peace and stability in Tajikistan, who are becoming 
victims of these obviously planned terrorist actions. An 
obvious aim can be traced: "To sow uncertainty and fear among 
the population and to provoke enmity between the peoples of 
Russia and Tajikistan," the Russian diplomat noted.

  [Text] Dushanbe 3 June TASS -- An unspecified number of 
Tajik opposition militants was killed in a major two-day 
military operation conducted by Russian frontier troops in the 
Central Asian republic. Nobody among the Russian military was 
injured, according to the headquarters of the Russian border 
guards in Tajikistan. 
  It said that during the operation held on 31 May and 1 June 
the troops combed the areas adjoining the Pyandzh section of the 
Tajik-Afghan border to neutralise opposition militants of the 
so-called "Pyandzh-Kumsangir front." The militants often 
shelled Russian border posts and mined border areas. 
  The headquarters also said that opposition militants are 
concentrating on the Afghan territory in the villages of Andzhiz 
and Yalur close to the section of the Moskovskiy border 
detachment. The military warned that they may fire on the 
opposition strongholds on Afghan territory to suppress the 
militants if the latter attack Russian border guards or Tajik 
government forces. "Adequate measures will be taken. Enemy 
strongholds will be eliminated regardless of their place of 
location," the military said.

  [Text] Tallinn, June 02, BNS -- Estonian lawmakers today 
took up the issue of the deadlocked Estonian-Russian relations 
and possible compromises with Moscow, but postponed the 
discussion until September on a proposal made by the Pro Patria 
faction in parliament. 
  A bill of the parliamentary foreign affairs commission 
recommended that Estonia seek compromises with Russia in border, 
economic and humanitarian issues. 
  Vello Saatpalu, the chairman of the foreign affairs 
commission and a member of the Social Democratic Party, 
suggested on behalf of the commission that an Estonian-Russian 
top level meeting be arranged with the help of mediators, if 
necessary, to resolve the problems concerning the border and the 
Tartu Peace Treaty. In his words, Estonia should also consider 
placing the Estonian-Russian border issue under a moratorium. 
  Foreign Minister Juri Luik in his report assured that 
Estonia 
stands firm that Russian troops must be unconditionally 
withdrawn from Estonia by Aug. 31, 1994. 
  Russia has so far refused to set the final pullout deadline 
and keeps linking it to the demand that more than 10,000 retired 
military be allowed to remain in Estonia. 
  Luik maintained that the Russian military retirees' issue 
can 
be solved only in accordance with Estonian legislation. What 
makes finding a solution more difficult is that Russia hasn't 
presented a list of its military pensioners in Estonia, striving 
to solve the problem by the "pig-in-a-poke" method, the foreign 
minister noted. He said the Russian Embassy claims there are 
10,500 Russian military pensioners in Estonia, while Tallinn has 
information their number amounts to 11,500. 
  Commenting on the dismantling of the nuclear reactors in 
Paldiski, Luik said the operation lags behind the planned 
schedule. He said an international monitoring group of 
representatives from the Council of the Baltic Sea States and 
the United States was set up in May, and that the group insists 
on prompt removal of the nuclear fuel rods from Estonia. 
  Luik said the linkage of nuclear reactor removal to other 
issues is internationally totally unacceptable. 
  Touching on the Estonian-Russian border dispute, the foreign 
minister said the key issue is Russia's unwillingness to 
recognize the 1920 Tarty Peace Treaty. It is extremely 
regrettable that Russia didn't agree to discuss the issue in the 
context of the European Stability Pact, known as the Balladur 
Plan, Luik said. 
  Estonian Ambassador to Russia Juri Kahn noted that the 
situation in Russia is at present considerably more stable than 
over the last few years. In his words, the power in Russia is 
more or less centered in President Boris Yeltsin's hands and the 
Western states have less leverage in influencing Russia's 
decisions. 
  The Estonian ambassador, however, predicted trouble for the 
autumn in Russia. He said the problems still on the agenda in 
Estonian-Russian relations should be resolved within the next 
two or three months. 
  The legislature suspended the discussion of Estonian-Russian 
relations until September. Tiit Sinissaar, the chairman of the 
Pro Patria faction in parliament, said the faction moved to 
postpone the discussion because the purpose of the bill was 
putting Estonian-Russian relations on the parliament's agenda 
and now the discussion can be resumed after the summer recess. 
  Endel Lippmaa, a member of the Assembly Party council, told 
reporters today that his party was against a provision of the 
bill stipulating that "solutions to problems of Estonian-Russian 
relations should be sought in compromises in border, economic 
and humanitarian issues." In Lippmaa's words, "it sounded as if 
Estonia were willing to make any concessions (to Russia)." 
Assembly Party members didn't support adoption of the bill.

  [Text] Tallinn, June 02, BNS -- Estonian Prime Minister 
Mart Laar said in an address in the parliament today that Moscow 
reaps no benefits from keeping 2,500 military in Estonia, on the 
contrary, this is seriously disadvantageous to Russia. 
  "It seems that meetings at the political top level are 
needed 
to make this clear," the premier said during the discussion of a 
bill on the relations between Estonia and Russia. 
  Laar assured that, in order to solve problems between the 
two 
countries, the Estonian Government has chosen a path that 
doesn't rule out mutually advantageous agreements and 
compromises but presumes that the Estonian-Russian relations are 
based on mutual respect and equality of rights. 
  Laar said the implementation of such a policy has forced the 
government to develop and strengthen the country's state and 
security institutions, work towards Estonia's economic 
independence from Russia, secure internal stability, and achieve 
as quickly as possible Estonia's integration into the Western 
community. 
  "Whereas 18 months ago the card of human rights was an ace 
in 
Russia's hand and a year ago the situation in eastern Virumaa 
and Narva was truly explosive, by now the human rights card has 
been beaten on the international arena and the power in eastern 
Virumaa is in the hands of entirely different principles and of 
local governments that support Estonian statehood," the premier 
claimed. "Tension has clearly been reduced in Estonia, this is 
what both foreign experts and local Russian organizations think."

  [Text] Tallinn, June 02, BNS -- Conclusion of a troop 
withdrawal agreement between Estonia and Russia would be very 
harmful to Estonia, Academician Endel Lippmaa, a member of the 
Assembly Party council, said at a press conference today. 
  In his words, such agreements contain reciprocal obligations 
which make Estonia very vulnerable. 
  "Since the Russian side is very reluctant to withdraw its 
troops, it would be a simple matter for it to accuse us of 
violating the stipulations of the treaty after it's been signed. 
There are previous instances of such stupid pacts. For 
example, Russia didn't delay taking advantage of the 1939 
military bases pact, accusing the Baltic states of violating the 
agreement, and that served as a pretext for bringing in more 
troops," Lippmaa pointed out. 
  Lippmaa said "unfortunately both Foreign Minister Juri Luik 
and President Lennart Meri" are for concluding a troop 
withdrawal agreement. 
  Russia wants to link the troop pullout treaty to signing an 
agreement also on social guarantees for its military retirees. 
This has become the main stumbling block in relations between 
the two countries because the Estonian side has so far rejected 
Russia's demand. 
  In Lippmaa's words, the Assembly Party isn't optimistic 
about 
Russian troop withdrawal being completed by Aug. 31. If 
Russian military presence in Estonia continues in September, the 
country's leaders must be prepared for "two essential 
demarches," he said. 
  "We must lodge a complaint (against Russia) at the U.N. 
Security Council. Under the U.N. charter, a major power loses 
its veto right when it's the accused party. Also, Estonia must 
take a more active part with regard to the NATO in the context 
of the Partnership for Peace program. NATO has no idea how to 
evaluate the continued presence of Russian troops in Estonia, so 
it's not interested in the emergence of the need for this and 
wants the troops to pull out," was Lippmaa's opinion.

  [Text] Tallinn, June 01, BNS -- The president of the 
Council of Europe's [CE] Parliamentary Assembly, Miguel Angel 
Martinez, arrived in Estonia for a visit Tuesday. 
  The visit comes at an invitation by the chairman of the 
Estonian parliament, Ulo Nugis, who gave a dinner in honor of 
the guest Tuesday evening. Present at the dinner were members 
of the Estonian delegation to the CE Parliamentary Assembly, 
Estonian MP's and ambassadors of the Council of Europe member 
nations to Estonia. 
  The Estonian parliament chairman in his speech said the 
country had always attached great importance to the work done 
under the Council of Europe framework. "We try to give the best 
to be worthy of our place in the common family of the 
organization," Nugis said. 
  Martinez in his speech said he was glad to state that 
Estonia 
has become a stable democratic country, which is always welcome 
in the CE activities. But he also mentioned that the danger of 
losing the freedom it has just gained had still not ceased for 
Estonia. 
  The CE Parliamentary Assembly chairman had a meeting today 
with Estonian parliament Deputy Chairman Tunne Kelam, also a 
deputy president of the Parliamentary Assembly. He then had 
talks with the Estonian delegation to the assembly, with the 
head of the parliament's foreign affairs commission, Vello 
Saatpalu, Foreign Minister Juri Luik and the representative of a 
CSCE mission to Estonia, Carmen Schmidt. 
  Martinez is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Mart Laar at 6 
p.m. today. He will continue the visit with a trip to the 
Lahemaa National Park, where parliament Deputy Chairman Tunne 
Kelam gives a dinner in his honor tonight. 
  Meetings with Tartu University Rector Peeter Tulviste and a 
member of the European Court of Human Rights, Uno Lohmus, in the 
southern city of Tartu are scheduled for Thursday. Martinez 
will also address a joint conference of the Tartu University 
Economics Department and Germany's Kiel Institute for World 
Economy. 
  Martinez is to meet Estonian President Lennart Meri and 
Tallinn Mayor Jaak Tamm Thursday afternoon. He is scheduled to 
leave Estonia in the evening.

  [Text] Tallinn, June 02, BNS -- Major General Aleksander 
Einseln, the commander of the Estonian Defense Forces, wants to 
resign because he is dissatisfied with the activity of Prime 
Minister Mart Laar. 
  Einseln asked President Lennart Meri on May 31 to accept the 
resignation he had put in May 4. The army chief found Laar's 
information about Estonian-Israeli cooperation "unethical, if 
not a downright lie." 
  Laar met on Feb. 8 with an Israeli working group led by 
General Dan Shomron to discuss questions of Estonia's security 
and defense concept and opportunities for Estonian-Israeli 
cooperation in defense. 
  "The leader of defense forces, who under the Constitution is 
competent with regard to national defense issues, was not 
informed about the meeting, its results and agreements 
concluded. Under the circumstances when the defense forces' 
chief lacks information about the premier's agreements with the 
Israeli TAAS company concerning national defense, the commander 
finds it difficult to answer for the country's defense 
capability and security," the information department of the 
Defense Forces general staff told BNS. 
  Einseln drew the conclusion that the prime minister doesn't 
trust him and "has on purpose been acting without consulting 
with him." Under the circumstances, Einseln considered his 
resignation "inevitable." 
  Former Defense Minister Indrek Kannik, too, has claimed that 
Laar's information about the Estonian-Israeli defense 
cooperation project is somewhat distorted. 
  Kannik claimed Laar maintained in a May 17 letter to Einseln 
that the "government has neither in my nor anyone else's person 
signed a cooperation project with General Shomron." 
  Kannik told BNS the record of Laar's Feb. 8 meeting with 
Shomron states that the "visitors and Mr. Laar agreed that the 
cooperation between Estonia and Israel may be divided into three 
main categories." 
  The former defense minister maintained one of the agreed 
categories concerns the establishment of a joint working group 
at the Estonian Interior Ministry to analyze both the military 
and security aspects of the Estonian defense concept. 
  The government press service told BNS that neither the 
Estonian Government nor ministries have signed any pacts or 
agreements without informing the Defense Forces general staff 
about it. 
  "During the visit of General Shomron to Estonia on Feb. 8-9 
the Israeli party proposed to form a joint working group to 
promote the mapping out of Estonia's defense concept. The 
Estonian side found that Estonia must have priority in this 
issue, but expert opinions are welcome. Consultations with 
private companies in security issues are widespread the world 
over, especially in the United States," the government press 
release reads. 
  The meeting between the Estonian premier and the Israeli 
general found that Estonia needs more assistance with questions 
falling within the competence of the Interior Ministry, 
primarily those concerning improvement of the work of the police 
and the border guard, therefore "further solution of this issue" 
was referred to the Interior Ministry, the press service said. 
  "Neither the premier nor the government have addressed this 
question. The Israeli side informed about its views on possible 
cooperation the Interior and the Defense Ministries. The prime 
minister's office has not received information about this," the 
government press service told BNS. 
  The press service confirms that the protocol of Laar's 
meeting with Shomron provides for the formation of an 
Estonian-Israeli working group at the Interior Ministry to 
analyze the Estonian defense concept. Both Interior and Defense 
Ministry officials are expected to belong to the group. 
  "The parties agreed that the group will start work as soon 
as 
possible and prepare a preliminary report by end June 1994," the 
press service informs.

  [Text] Tallinn, June 2 -- President Lennart Meri has 
refused to accept the resignation of Aleksander Einseln, the 
head of the Estonian Defence Forces, as leaving the position 
vacant would harm Estonia's state and security, the president's 
press office informed ETA on Thursday. Meri had received 
Einseln's letter of resignation on May 31 and had immediately 
responded that the interests of Estonian state prevented him 
from accepting the resignation and that he was to continue his 
service. 
  Einseln's press office released a statement earlier on 
Thursday saying he wanted to resign in protest over being left

  [Text] Tallinn, June 01, BNS -- Former Defense Minister 
Indrek Kannik today accused Prime Minister Mart Laar of giving 
the public, as he said, slightly distorted information about a 
defense cooperation plan between Estonia and Israel. 
  Kannik mentioned that Laar had been incorrect when denying 
having signed any documents about defense cooperation with 
Israel. The former minister quoted Laar's May 17 letter to the 
commander in chief of the country's defense forces, Major 
General Aleksander Einseln, in which the premier said the 
government had signed no agreement with Israeli General Dan 
Shomron. 
  But a protocol of a Feb. 8 meeting between Laar and Shomron 
states that "the guests and Mr. Laar agreed that cooperation 
between Estonia and Israel can be divided into three main 
categories," Kannik said today, adding that one of these three 
had been setting up a joint work group to review Estonia's 
defense concept both from the military as well as from security 
aspects. The work group was to be formed under the Estonian 
Interior Ministry. 
  Laar before the Feb. 8 meeting suggested the work group to 
be 
subjected to the Defense Ministry, but that proposal was turned 
down, Kannik said in the interview with BNS. 
  Estonia's POSTIMEES daily newspaper in its May 30 edition 
reported that Commander in Chief Aleksander Einseln was seeking 
clarity over allegations that the prime minister had bypassed 
him in steps toward a defense cooperation plan with Israel. 
Einseln said his suspicions were raised after an aide to Leonid 
Apananski, considered a key figure behind the country's major 
arms purchase deal from Israel, in a confidential letter 
informed a Central Staff officer about a May 10-12 visit to 
Tallinn of an Israeli delegation. The visit had been to discuss 
a cooperation project, started by Mart Laar and Israeli General 
Dan Shamron, the letter alleged.

  [Text] Tallinn, June 01, BNS -- Estonian Prime Minister 
Mart Laar met in Tallinn today with a delegation from the 
Institute of Mitsui &amp; Co. for Trade and Economic Studies. The 
mission from the institute under the Japanese investment giant 
Mitsui &amp; Co. was led by the institute's President Yoshikatsu 
Hironaka. The visit was due to Mitsui's interest toward the 
economic situation and development opportunities in Estonia as 
well as prospects for the company's operation in the region, the 
government press office says. 
  Laar at the meeting spoke at some length about the country's 
economic policy guidelines and explained that his government had 
based its steps on the principle of radical reform. He said 
that in order to attract someone's attention in the present-day 
world, one had to make steps that may not be common elsewhere. 
  The guests at the meeting praised Estonia's speed in 
proceeding on the reform path. They said the country's resolve 
in introducing a proportional 26-percent income tax was 
impressing. The discussion further focused on the situation in 
the sphere of foreign investments and trade between the two 
countries. The mission members were particularly interested in 
facts about the free trade treaty to be signed between Estonia 
and the European Union soon.

  [Text] Tallinn, June 01, BNS -- George Soros, the 
investment tycoon well-known in the Baltics and in the whole 
eastern Europe for his large-scale culture and education funding 
projects, met with Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar in Tallinn 
today. 
  The Estonian leader at the meeting praised the billionaire 
supporter of arts and humanitarian projects for the funding 
programs he has launched also in Estonia. Discussed in more 
detail were three projects in the field of education, of which 
Soros himself underlined as most important a prospective 
half-million dollar plan in support of Estonia's school reform. 
Also spoken of were programs in support for higher education 
and research, and one on legal education. 
  Finally at the meeting, Soros asked the Estonian leader 
about 
the country's economic development and its prospects, the 
government press office reports. He asked if Estonia's current 
"progressive" government didn't fear a possible setback with the 
possibility that former Communists might return to power. 
  Laar in his answer said that Estonia had already crossed 
that 
critical stage when the former Communist party "nomenklatura" 
could be elected to power. But he didn't rule out possible 
success of a more leftist and less radical way of thinking. 
  Soros at a separate press conference in Tallinn later in the 
day focused on the activity of the Open Estonia Foundation, set 
up to channel Soros' money for charity and assistance projects 
in Estonia. The Open Estonia Foundation projects together with 
financial assistance coming through Soros International Science 
Foundation amount to more than three million dollars in Soros' 
support for Estonia this year. 
  Soros declined to give a detailed assessment of the 
political 
developments in the three Baltic countries. But while 
commenting on some critical remarks he had made at a meeting 
with Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis on the country's 
citizenship law, he today said he was glad to find Estonia's 
citizenship law much more liberal. 
  The billionaire investor said it was clear that Latvia 
during 
the era of Soviet rule had suffered much, had "undergone nearly 
genocide." But he spoke up against leaving any groups of the 
country's population without many essential rights as means of 
retaliation. 
  He called on the Baltics not to allow the notion of whatever 
nation being collectively guilty for some misdoings -- a notion 
which he stressed was absolutely wrong -- to have an influence 
on their decisions. 
  George Soros was born in Budapest on Aug. 12, 1930, but 
emigrated to Britain in 1947. Lives in New York since 1956. He 
is currently the president of Soros Fund Management and main 
adviser for Quantum Fund over investments. His humanitarian 
project support funds operate in 21 Central and East European 
countries, as well as one in South Africa.

  [Excerpts] Although intensive combat operations have not 
taken place in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR], the 
situation in that region is tense. The tension has worsened 
because Azerbaijan's military units continue to fire on the 
Armenian defense positions on various parts of NKR's front line. 
The enemy side violates the agreement for a cease-fire from 
time to time. Obviously, Azerbaijan's Military Command 
Headquarters is unable to control all of its military forces. 
  The Armenian positions in [place-name indistinct], Tauz, and 
Lernak in Mardakertskiy Rayon; Shuraabad, [place-name 
indistinct], and Gyullyudzha in Agdamskiy Rayon; and 
Karakhanbeyli in Fizulinskiy Rayon were fired on with various 
types of arms today. The Armenian side refrained from returning 
the fire. Considering Azerbaijan failed to sign the agreement 
in Moscow to end the confrontation, the NKR Defense Army is 
convinced that enemy units will launch a wide-scale attack very 
soon. Undoubtedly, that will be disastrous for Azerbaijan. 
Furthermore, the international community will realize that 
Azerbaijan's leaders and nationalist circles wish to 
deliberately worsen the situation in the region. [passage 
omitted] 
  No serious incidents occurred on the border between Armenia 
and Azerbaijan until this afternoon. That has been the case for 
the past few days. 
  We wish to hope that the relatively peaceful situation will 
continue to exist and [words indistinct].

  [Text] An Armenian-Azerbaijani meeting took place on the 
border near Yeraskh [an Armenian village bordering Nakhichevan 
Autonomous Republic] on 2 June. The Armenian side asked the 
Nakhichevani delegation about the misinformation disseminated by 
the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry and the press service of the 
National Assembly on 31 May, which say that allegedly the 
Armenian Army units have invaded the Nakhichevani territory and 
occupy a strategically important hill. 
  The Armenian Defense Ministry press service informed 
ARMENPRES that Brigade Commander Colonel Farman Aliyev, who 
commands all the army units in Nakhichevan, has declared that he 
himself heard that news from Moscow's Vesti television program 
for the first time, and added that it does not conform to 
reality.

<F P=106> [Interview with Karen Baburyan, acting chairman of the </F>
Karabakh parliament, by Emmanuil Mkrtchyan, ROSSIYA 
correspondent; place and date not given: "Karabakh Needs 
Guarantees"] 
  [Text] [Begin bold]In June of last year, the leadership of 
Nagorno-Karabakh confirmed its agreement to participate in the 
process of a peaceful settlement of the conflict within the 
framework of the Minsk group of the CSCE. The current acting 
chairman of the Karabakh parliament, 30-year-old Karen Baburyan, 
signed the document. Our correspondent met with him in 
Stepanakert the other day.[end bold] 
  [Mkrtchyan] Mr. Baburyan, you are one of the leaders of the 
Nagorno-Karabakh republic, which is still not recognized by the 
world community. Is it possible, in your opinion, to consider 
Karabakh an independent state in a full sense. 
  [Baburyan] You know, by right our republic has come halfway 
to being a state, for international organizations are already 
taking us into account, and they do not make one decision 
without our participation. And we do not intend to depart from 
this state of affairs under any conditions. It is important 
that Nagorno-Karabakh be recognized by the international 
community as a party in the conflict. 
  You see in my office the main attributes of our independent 
statehood. In front of you is the state flag and the seal of 
the Nagorno-Karabakh republic. We have our own constitutional 
law, democratically elected higher organs of legislative 
authority, administrations, and a defense-capable army that 
performs as a guarantor of the security of our people. 
  [Mkrtchyan] The process of a peaceful settlement of the 
Karabakh conflict, after the refusal of the Azerbaijani side to 
adopt the peaceful plans proposed by the CSCE and Russia, has 
come to an impasse. What dictates such an irreconcilable 
position of the Azerbaijani leadership? 
  [Baburyan] The opportunism of the authorities. The 
Azerbaijani leaders, succeeding one another, tried to strengthen 
their positions and to demonstrate to political opponents their 
ability to resolve the Karabakh problem by military means. 
  The NKR [Nagorno-Karabakh Republic] leadership adheres to 
the 
opinion concerning the need to bring the Russian settlement plan 
and the CSCE plan together. These initiatives differ little 
from each other in principle. However, the Russian plan has the 
advantage that it contains a mechanism for not renewing military 
operations, and it proposes the introduction of peacekeeping 
forces into the region. 
  [Mkrtchyan] But why is Azerbaijan refusing military 
disengagement with the help of mediators? 
  [Baburyan] The leader of that republic who succeeds in 
achieving a military preponderance will be guaranteed a high 
political rating. In addition, the current leadership of 
Azerbaijan needs not only to strengthen its superiority over the 
opposition, but also to establish itself in mutual relations 
with Turkey, which is not concealing its urge to help Azerbaijan 
resolve the question by forceful methods. 
  Incidentally, I do not understand when it is said that 
Armenia is involved in the conflict, but Turkey is not. I think 
that if the signatures of representatives of the NKR and Armenia 
should appear on some kind of official document, then Turkey's 
signature should stand right next to Azerbaijan's signature. We 
in Karabakh possess a mass of evidence that citizens of Turkey 
are fighting on the side of Azerbaijan. 
  [Mkrtchyan] How do you assess the position of Russia in the 
region, and how pragmatic is it? 
  [Baburyan] Unfortunately, a clearly formulated Russian 
foreign policy has not existed for some time. I think that 
without its traditional geopolitical interests Russia will not 
be a power. These interests also apply to Nagorno-Karabakh, 
which was historically closely tied to Russia by hundreds of 
threads. Russia was always present in this zone, and she should 
not be indifferent to everything that is happening in the 
region. And, therefore, it is quite natural that Russia began 
to perform more actively as a peacekeeping force. The plan for 
the deployment of disengagement forces proposed by it is fully 
supported by the Karabakh leadership. However, the problem of 
the deployment of military contingents encounters the need to 
resolve a number of tasks; for example, purely financial. 
Incidentally, it is for this reason also that the NKR 
leadership is coming out in favor of combining the Russian plan 
and the CSCE plan, so that Russia would receive an international 
mandate to carry out a peacekeeping mission. 
  [Mkrtchyan] Mr. Baburyan, what do you see as the resolution 
of the problem? 
  [Baburyan] It is necessary to look further for compromise 
variants and to stop talking in the form of an ultimatum. We, 
the leaders of the NKR, were always for this. We have one 
principal condition--we must be assured real guarantees for the 
security of our people. The most effective way of achieving 
this, as I have already said, is the introduction of 
peacekeeping forces into the region.

on Compromise'"] 
  [Text] "The fact that 15 deputies of the National Assembly 
have returned to work in the parliament does not mean that we 
are afraid of a rotation that could result in our displacement," 
stated Tofik Gasymov, people's deputy of Azerbaijan and chairman 
of the parliamentary Commission on State Structuring, in an 
interview with a correspondent of the KHABAR-SERVIS agency. "We 
do not want to be accused of disrupting the adoption of economic 
laws and decisions important for the republic and for the 
people." The demand upon which these deputies just recently 
left the parliament, depriving it of a quorum for an indefinite 
period of time, remains unchanged: The issue of the Bishkek 
Protocol must be included in the agenda of parliamentary 
sessions. 
  T. Gasymov noted that the group continues to insist on an 
examination of this question at a separate session of the 
National Assembly. He categorically denied the assertion that 
the return of the deputies constituted a compromise with the 
authorities. "This step was dictated by a desire not to inflame 
political passions in the republic to their ultimate limit. The 
authorities intended to provoke the people, in their eyes 
heaping upon us all the clumsiness and incompetence of the 
leadership," the chairman of the parliamentary commission stated.

  [Text] "My return to the National Assembly will be 
possible only after the authorities deliver to me an apology for 
their insults. But if the parliament accepts my resignation, 
the interests of the Party of National Independence of 
Azerbaijan [PNIA] in the National Assembly will be represented 
by two deputies--Shadman Guseynov and Firudin Dzhalilov," PNIA 
leader Etibar Mamedov told journalists immediately after 
relinquishing his deputy credentials and leaving the house of 
parliament on 25 May. He stated at this session that the 
monopolies that control Azerbaijan's oil industry were presently 
not affording any opportunity for a contract to be signed with 
the consortium of Western oil companies in the shortest time 
frame. 
  With respect to establishment of the opposition National 
Resistance Movement [NRM], E. Mamedov stated that this movement 
was organized with a single aim--to prevent Russian troops from 
coming into the republic. "Had President Geydar Aliyev announced 
18 May the inadmissibility of this action, no one would have 
created the NRM," the opposition leader noted. He also refuted 
information to the effect that the NRM had called upon the army 
and students to engage in civil disobedience. "Intransigence of 
the opposition or of the authorities in Azerbaijan is today 
intolerable," the parliamentarian stated. 
  Regarding the question of signing the Bishkek Protocol, E. 
Mamedov noted that a unified point of view had not been 
formulated among the structures of power. In particular, the 
president and speaker of the parliament supported its adoption, 
while the prime minister, minister of foreign affairs, and 
deputy speaker categorically rejected such a possibility. 
Etibar Mamedov stated that the return of 15 people's deputies 
to the parliament was at their own initiative, since no one from 
the leadership entered into negotiations or tried to reach 
compromise with them. On the contrary, they were subject to 
sharp criticism.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Centrist Party Bloc Supports Bishkek </F>
Protocol"] 
  [Text] A press conference was held 26 May with 
representatives of the Centrist Party Bloc [CPB] at the staff 
headquarters of the Social-Democratic Party of Azerbaijan 
[SDPA]. A correspondent of the agency ANS-PRESS reports that 
Abil Guseynov, member of the Bureau of the SDPA Central 
Committee who opened the press conference, expressed 
dissatisfaction with the work of the CPB Coordinating Council 
and with the frivolous attitude displayed by certain bloc 
members towards the work done in commissions. He informed 
journalists that beginning next week, chairmanship of the bloc 
will go to the party Ana Veten for a month. Virtually all 
representatives of the Centrist Party Bloc, with the exception 
of the Social-Democrats, have supported the signing of the 
Bishkek Protocol. They have not explained the reasons for their 
attitude towards the document, however. 
  Nizami Suleymanov, chairman of the party Independent 
Azerbaijan and a supporter of the Bishkek Protocol, condemned 
the fact that it was not discussed by the National Assembly. 
Fakhraddin Aydayev, leader of the party Equality of the Peoples 
of Azerbaijan, stated that Azerbaijan had no alternative to the 
Bishkek Protocol. Abil Guseynov, SDPA representative to the 
CPB, stated in turn that the Social-Democrats did not agree with 
certain points of the Bishkek Protocol. He stated that Karen 
Baburyan was a citizen of Azerbaijan and had no right to sign 
any international documents on behalf of the self-proclaimed NKR 
[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]. In his view, Azerbaijan 
authorities should therefore not have sat down at the 
negotiating table with Baburyan. 
  Guseynov noted that the SDPA was supporting the protocol 
because it provides for a cease-fire, which will provide the 
opportunity to gain time, especially since this document 
represents simply a protocol of intentions. A. Guseynov noted 
that his party was opposed to the introduction of Russian troops 
into Azerbaijan, and even if they were stationed in the republic 
as international peacekeeping forces, such forces must include 
Turkish troops.

<F P=106> [Report by Irada Gurbanova: "Russian Parliamentarians' </F>
Visit"] 
  [Text] On 28 May, Russian parliamentarians met with 
representatives of the Russian-speaking population of 
Azerbaijan. The meeting, which was held last Saturday in the 
Gyulistan Palace, was attended by A. Dzhalilov, deputy chairman 
of the Azerbaijani Supreme Council. M. Zabelin, an Azerbaijani 
Supreme Council deputy and the chairman of the Russian 
community, delivered the introductory address. Having introduced 
the guests, he described the purpose of their visit--to learn 
the truth about the sociopolitical situation in the republic so 
that they could later bring to every Russian the truth about the 
Karabakh conflict, the everyday life of the Russians living 
here. The meeting proceeded on a very friendly note. 
  The Russian parliamentarians came to this meeting straight 
from the reception by the republic's president, G. Aliyev. The 
prominent theme in the meeting was that the main pain for the 
Russians in Azerbaijan is the same as for all Azerbaijani 
people--the six-year-old Armenian aggression and its terrible 
consequences, as well as one-sided, and often distorted, 
coverage of it by Russian mass media. 
  We all know what broad activities members of the Russian 
community (created at the initiative of Azerbaijan-Russia 
Society) and the Sodruzhestvo Slavic Culture Center have 
launched outside of the republic for the purpose of breaking 
through the information blockade and establishing connections 
with Russia. And this is very understandable: Those for whom 
Azerbaijan is home, regardless of their ethnic identification, 
cannot help but be concerned over everything that is happening 
to their homeland. And do not members of other ethnic groups, 
first and foremost Russians, fight together with sons of 
Azerbaijani people for the independence and territorial 
integrity of their republic? In the Alley of Martyrs, next to 
National Heroes of Azerbaijan E. Yakhyayev and H. Hasanov, also 
lie National Heroes of Azerbaijan Yu. Kovalenko (his mother was 
present at the meeting) and V. Plotnikov. 
  Both Russian parliamentarians and meeting participants said 
that Armenians actively use Russian arms and mercenaries, and 
that the fact of aggression has not yet been recognized by any 
international document because the war is conducted not by 
regular troops but by gangster formations. 
  L. Morozova, a deputy chairman of Azerbaijan's Russian 
community, said that as a head of the Azerbaijani delegation she 
had traveled through all the North Caucasus, meeting with 
Cossack atamans and heads of oblasts and krays, and through them 
she learned that Armenians, taking advantage of privatization, 
buy up real estate literally for peanuts. In addition, she 
presented a newspaper, which published a report that a deputy 
minister of the Armenian MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] had 
issued a decree on placing settlers in all these oblasts. In a 
couple of years, she warned, a new Karabakh may quite easily 
emerge in the North Caucasus. And for some reason, Armenian 
genocide toward the Azerbaijani people still has not been 
recognized. While at the same time life in Shusha is vibrant, 
tourists are invited to visit, enterprises are being built, and 
landmarks of cultural history are entered in registers as 
Armenian. 
  Having angrily denounced Armenian aggression against 
Azerbaijan and supporting the course taken by the farsighted 
politician G. Aliyev, the Russians living in Azerbaijan called 
on their compatriots to support the protest, to take a stand 
against Armenian occupiers seizing the territory of others, 
against brutality perpetrated upon the Azerbaijani civilian 
population. To this Russian parliamentarians said that they will 
resolutely support the efforts to achieve the quickest possible 
peace and accord on the soil of Azerbaijan. 
  It was also noted that Azerbaijan is a motherland for all 
its 
inhabitants, and regardless of their nationality all its 
citizens enjoy equal rights. 
  Among other issues brought up in the course of the meeting 
was education in the Russian language. In particular, it was 
said that although Russian classes in schools and Russian groups 
in institutes are now smaller in numbers, none of the Russian 
schools have been closed to this day. This can happen soon, 
however, since Russia now sells Russian-language textbooks for 
hard currency, which we cannot afford. 
  Most questions asked by journalists revolved around bringing 
Russian forces into Azerbaijan with the status of peacekeeping 
forces. 
  Naturally, the lack of continuous information is capable of 
inflaming passions around one or another event. People in the 
republic have long stopped reading Russian newspapers. And those 
that occasionally are available for sale do not add much 
clarity. Plus, opposition press reports sometimes are quite 
arguable, and quite often are unsubstantiated. 
  Apparently, this has prompted such an interest in the 
question of bringing in peacekeeping forces, to which the 
concrete answer was given that Russian troops are not going to 
be brought here. 
  At the end of the meeting Supreme Council Deputy Chairman A. 
Dzhalilov congratulated everyone on the occasion of the 
holiday--Republic Day--and thanked Russian parliamentarians for 
mutual understanding and the Russians for participation in the 
meeting, and promised that all the issues raised by them will be 
resolved at state level.

adoption of the law on privatization and its implementation in 
the sphere of trade and consumer facilities and incomplete

of finance of Azerbaijan, in an interview with a correspondent 
of the KHABAR-SERVIS agency. Yusifov noted that the program in 
question provided for the conversion to joint-stock operation of 
large industrial facilities as well. The Ministry of Finance 
chief emphasized that he considers it necessary to privatize any 
unprofitable enterprise in any sector of industry, with the 
exception of those the state must control. To the question as 
to whether or not the major oil refineries of Baku were on the 
list of enterprises subject to privatization, F. Yusifov 
responded negatively, but added that it was entirely possible to 
do so. He also explained that the future law would permit 
changing the production structure of facilities converted to 
joint-stock operation, and that no obstacles to this were 
envisaged.

  [Text] Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas and 
Europarliament President Egon Klepsch so no reasons why an 
associative treaty could not be concluded between Lithuania and 
the European Union, the Lithuanian president's foreign policy 
adviser Petras Vaitekunas told Interfax. 
  Vaitekunas said that Brazauskas had again complained that 
Russia had not honored the trade and economic agreement signed 
last November. By doing so, Brazauskas told Klepsch, Russia 
tried to make it more compliant in other areas. (IF Note: In 
particular, Russia wants free transit to the Kaliningrad Region 
across Lithuania). 
  Klepsch expressed satisfaction over the fact that the 
relations between Lithuania and Russia had been largely settled 
and added that Europe would welcome positive results of talks on 
the outstanding bilateral issues. 
  Speaking of Lithuania's efforts to strengthen the contacts 
between the Baltic countries and the Visegrad group, Brazauskas 
called for more tangible western aid to the Ukrainian economy. 
  He said that early admission of Latvia to the Council of 
Europe would contribute to security in the Baltics.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jun 02, BNS -- The European Parliament 
fully supports Lithuania in its efforts to become an associate 
member of the European Union, the president of the European 
Union [EU], Egon Klepsch, said at a press conference in Vilnius 
Thursday. The press conference completed Klepsch's official 
three-day visit to Lithuania. 
  Klepsch said the time is right for Lithuania and the EU to 
make "resolute decisions" on associate membership. In his 
words, Lithuania's economic progress gives hope that nothing 
will hinder the process. 
  The European Parliament president once again emphasized that 
he is pleased with the successful implementation of the troop 
withdrawal agreement between Lithuania and Russia. 
  This proves, he said, that Lithuania has the ability "to 
combine common interests" and can become a peace mediator in the 
Baltic Sea region. Such a role is also predetermined by 
Lithuania's geographical location, he said. 
  Klepsch expressed hope that the Lithuanian-Russian agreement 
on the most favored nation trade status will soon come into 
effect. He also praised the Lithuanian municipal elections law, 
which was adopted Tuesday. Klepsch said the law meets Western 
requirements. 
  Commenting on his visit to Lithuania, Klepsch said he 
obtained much information about different political forces, 
discussed Lithuania's relations with the European Parliament and 
cooperation between the three Baltic states.

  [Text] Lithuanian Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius will 
announce his government's resignation at a session of the Seimas 
(republican parliament) next week, he said in the answer to an 
Interfax question at a news conference in Vilnius Thursday. 
  This procedure is defined by the Lithuanian Constitution. 
Under it, the parliament is to confirm the government's powers 
if more than a half of its composition has been reshuffled. 
Otherwise, the government must resign. 
  This situation emerged following the need to introduce three 
new ministers whose offices would be set up in accordance with a 
law on government passed by the Seimas. 
  If Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas asks Slezevicius 
to form a new government again, the present composition will 
remain as it is and only the three new ministers will be added. 
Slezevicius is the chairman of the majority Democratic Labor 
Party in the parliament. 
  This government which has been in power for less than 1.5 
years is the sixth since Lithuania regained independence in 
March 1990. Over this period, Lithuania has achieved a number of 
positive changes such as stabilizing the economy, lower 
inflation and higher standard of living.

  [Text] In the first four months of this year the state 
budget failed to receive about 300 million litas of planned 
revenue. This was announced at a news conference today by 
Bagaciunas, head of a branch at the Ministry of Finance's budget 
department. The news conference was also attended by Feliksas 
Kolosauskas, chairman of the Seimas budget and finance 
committee, . 
  It is known that the approved national budget for this year 
totals 4.3 billion litas. Attempts are being made to compensate 
the deficit by borrowing from other funds and structures. Among 
others, the head of the budget branch mentioned the state 
privatization fund. The government is borrowing from the 
commercial banks in Lithuania, too. The Ministry of Finance has 
taken a short term loan of 15 million litas at a 60 percent 
annual interest. According to Bagaciunas, an agreement was 
signed recently on a short-term loan of 20 million litas. 
  Because of this deficit, planned expenditure must be limited 
in the budget, too: wages, pensions, and grants. According to 
Bagaciunas, there will be spheres of priority to which the 
budget funds will be directed first of all. 
  The branch chief at the ministry's budget department is 
pinning hopes on Value Added Tax [VAT]. With the help of this 
tax, the Ministry of Finance expects to obtain about 150 million 
litas this year.

  [Text] Aivars Vovers, under-secretary of state for Eastern 
Affairs at the foreign ministry, and leader of the Latvian group 
of experts at the upcoming joint talks with Russia, said today a 
group of experts from Latvia and Russia will have ten agreements 
on mutual economic cooperation ready for signing. The experts 
have mainly worked in preparation for the visit of Russian Prime 
Minister Chernomyrdin to Latvia, scheduled for late June. It is 
possible that the two countries' leaders will sign the prepared 
agreements on Latvian-Russian cooperation in transportation, on 
mutual protection of capital investments, on handing over to 
Russian ownership of the Amber Coast sanatorium, and on 
cooperation in the protection of industrial property. The 
experts are coordinating the text of a declaration on the trends 
in and prospects for the two countries' economic cooperation. 
During Chernomyrdin's visit they will also discuss questions 
relating to the two countries' prospective cooperation in 
educational, cultural and information areas. In addition, the 
leaders might discuss the issue of the construction of an 
international gas pipeline through Latvia.

  [Text] Riga, Jun 2, BNS -- The most favored nation regime, 
Russia reportedly introduced in trade with Latvia on June 1, is 
a temporary development since Russia reserves the right to 
cancel it any moment it wants to, Aivars Vovers, Latvian Foreign 
Ministry deputy state secretary, told BNS Thursday. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry informed the Latvian Embassy in 
Moscow about the decision by a note, handed in on May 30. 
  The agreement on the most favored nation status between 
Latvia and Russia is a positive factor for increasing the 
competitiveness of Latvian products, officials said Wednesday. 
  The motion will increase the mutual goods turnover between 
both countries. Export of goods to Russia was very 
disadvantageous to Latvia after March 15 when Russia raised 
import tariffs on a series of products. 
  Russia is still the largest Latvian trade partner. Export of 
Latvian goods to Russia comprises 30 percent of its total export. 
  Russia also expressed a hope in the note that Latvia will 
ratify the signed agreements on the Russian troop withdrawal and 
the social rights of Russian military retirees and their 
families in the near future, the Latvian Foreign Ministry 
reported.

  [Text] The Daugavpils [town] council has presented a 
protest to the command of the Northwestern Group of Forces of 
the Russian Army concerning the fact that it is not observing 
the schedule agreed for the withdrawal of the army from the town 
and the provision of residences belonging to the special 
municipal services of the town, who cannot take over the 
unsupervised conditions and the ransacked apartments, depots, 
and storehouses. Restoration work is, in practice, carried out 
by workers paid by the municipal housing administration, but 
compensation for them has not reached the town, nor does it 
intend to place the burden of the expense on the people of 
Daugavpils.

enterprise is expected to cover its 23-million-U.S.-dollar debt 
to the Russian Gazprom gas consortium Thursday, Latvijas Gaze 
President Girts Stalbovics told reporters. 
  The money comes from the Japanese Import and Export Bank 
credit, which is guaranteed by the Latvian Government. 
  Latvijas Gaze owed Gazprom 29.2 million dollars on May 27 
for 
supplied gas. Latvijas Gze must also pay Russia 2.5 million 
dollars in fines for delayed payment. 
  Russia has pumped 32 million cubic meters of gas into the 
Incukalns container by May 27, Stalbovics noted.

  [Text] Latvia would like to see the territory of Abrene as 
part of Latvia, as decreed in the Latvian-Russian peace treaty 
of 1920. This was stated at a press conference today devoted to 
Latvia's participation in the Balladur, or European stability, 
pact, by the acting foreign minister, Justice Minister Egils 
Levits. The Estonian and Latvian delegations to the conference 
in Paris on the inauguration of the pact presented a joint 
document on the border question, declaring that the state 
borders of Europe are based on internationally recognized and 
binding treaties. As is known, part of the Abrene district, an 
area of 1,260 square km, was apportioned to Russia in August 
1944. Nine Eastern and Central European countries, which wish 
to join the European Union, have created discussion forums, 
namely the Baltic Table and the Central European Table, at which 
the other interested countries and the European Union will take 
part. The Baltic Table will be attended by the Baltic 
countries, perhaps also Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and the United 
States. 
  Russia will specify issues to be reviewed and will only then 
decide on partciipation at the Baltic Table.

European Union (work on the text of this agreement was concluded 
on Wednesday in Brussels) is to go into effect January 1, 1995.

reported this at a press conference in Riga Wednesday also 
pointed out that the republic has become the first Baltic state 
which is ready to initial the document. 
  All Baltic states started the negotiations on the conclusion 
of this agreement late February. 
  In Pavlovskis' words, the document can be initialled on June 
20 and then it is to be ratified by the Latvian parliament. 
  In accordance with the agreement, no customs tariffs will be 
imposed on Latvian goods imported to the Western European 
countries. As he said, this regime is valid only for 40% 
of 
Latvia's total foreign trade. However, it does not touch upon 
agricultural products and textile, Latvia's major export goods. 
  Pavlovskis indicated that the agreement has both economic 
and 
political significance because it is a good gesture on the part 
of the Western European countries which view Latvia as an 
integral partner.

  [Text] On Thursday without any debate the Latvian Saeimas 
confirmed the deputy mandate of the former first secretary of 
the Central Committee of the Latvian Communist Party Alfreds 
Rubiks. As many as 42 deputies, including the majority of the 
representatives of the ruling faction, Latvian Put, voted for 
this decision, 11 against, and 17 abstained from voting. There 
are 100 deputies in the Latvian Saeimas. 
  Deputy Chairman of the Latvian Put Indulis Berzins declared 
to INTERFAX that the faction recognized that the parliament's 
refusal to confirm Rubiks' mandate on the first day of Saeimas' 
work contradicts the law. 
  The trial of Rubiks' case who is accused of an attempted 
conspiracy with the aim to seize power in January and August 
1991 was started on June 14, 1992. Rubiks was arrested after 
the failure of the August coup of 1991 in Moscow in his working 
Cabinet. 
  Rubiks, who was elected as a deputy of the new Latvian 
parliament did not have his mandate confirmed at the first 
sitting of the Saeimas on July 6, 1993. 
  Representatives of the faction Ravnopravie (Equality) to 
which Rubiks belongs have repeatedly declared that this decision 
contradicts Latvia's Constitution. The Constitution stipulates 
that the mandate of a deputy can be suspended only in case of 
his death, voluntarily refusal from his mandate, or a decision 
of the court stating that the deputy committed a crime.

<F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM-TASS] </F>
  [Text] Kiev 3 June ITAR-TASS -- "Ukraine's relations with 
Russia must be built with the future in mind, with the 
realization that the two states must live in peace and accord," 
announced Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk in Kiev on Friday 
[3 June]. The president was speaking at a meeting with the 
heads of Russia's leading mass media, members of the Moscow 
editors-in-chief club. 
  Speaking of the situation in the Crimea and the Black Sea 
Fleet, Kravchuk emphasized that "it would be absurd for the 
Crimea to completely distance itself from Ukraine, since the 
peninsula is inseparably connected to Ukraine and depends on it. 
Of course," Kravchuk noted, "there are questions which must be 
jointly resolved. One of them is the division of the Black Sea 
Fleet and the decision where to establish the bases for the 
Russian fleet and the Ukrainian navy. But here, too, everybody 
must demonstrate patience, common sense, and mutual respect." 
  Asked whether he was sure the conflict with the Crimea could 
be resolved in exclusively peaceful ways, Kravchuk announced, 
"Not under any circumstances will we resort to the use of armed 
force, and we appeal to the Crimean leadership to adhere to the 
same principle." 
  Concerning the future of land and federalism in Ukraine, the 
president noted that, "this is not a subject for casual 
conversation, it cannot be examined on the everyday, 
non-professional level." In that connection, he stressed that 
he supports economic federalism, "if one may use such a 
category," and favors handing over some power to the regions. 
But, Kravchuk noted, "as world experience shows, real 
federations were created over long periods. One must not forget 
about that." 
  The Russian mass media heads expressed their concern over 
the 
Ukrainian president's attitude toward foreign journalists 
working in his country. Naturally, they had in mind the recent 
Ukrainian Foreign Ministry's decision to refuse to accredit 
three "Ostankino" correspondents. Kravchuk replied, "I do not 
share (the Foreign Ministry's) position. That was also 
unexpected for me. Those questions should be resolved in a 
different way than they were." He agreed to discuss the 
proposal to create a single informational space with the rest of 
the CIS heads of state, and announced his readiness to take the 
initiative in sponsoring such a document. 
  The mediamen also asked the president about his personal 
ambitions: what would he like? The answer was: "For the Ukraine 
to make some progress in the economic sphere; for friendly 
relations to be developed between neighbors, not de jure, but de 
facto, in particular, between Russia and Ukraine, since there 
are no alternatives in this respect. I want Russians to look at 
Ukraine as an equal partner." 
  Speaking about his relations with the Ukrainian Supreme 
Soviet and its chairman Alexander Moroz, Kravchuk called the 
former business-like, and the latter, were termed "normal." 
"Time will tell how they will be in the future. After all, as 
it is, the deputies have only looked at, besides the situation 
in the Crimea, the internal questions of their work." 
  As far as the upcoming presidential elections are concerned, 
Kravchuk said, "the elections will be held. The main battle, in 
my opinion, will take place in the second round. Who will enter 
it? I think that Kuchma will. I am almost sure of that. Who 
else? I might," the president commented.

  [Text] Kiev -- The "Ukraine" democratic association on 1 
June issued a statement in connection with the presence of 
Russian cossack formations in Crimea. The document, in 
particular, reads, as follows: "Recently, a neighboring state's 
military formations have insolently held a so-called `grand 
council' on our territory. They are guarding Crimea's antistate, 
anti-Ukrainian parliament, creating havoc and raping women. We 
demand the protection of Ukrainian citizens from unruly, armed 
foreigners. 
  "We emphasize that the formation, development, actions, and 
financing of the Russian cossacks are under the supervision of 
the Russian Government. That is why we regard cossack raids on 
our territory as Russia's interference in Ukraine's internal 
affairs, the more so in that the existence and presence of 
paramilitary public formations is outlawed in Ukraine." 
  The "Ukraine" democratic association demands that the 
Ukrainian Foreign Affairs Ministry immediately lodge a note of 
protest with the Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry in connection 
with the presence of Russian cossacks in Crimea and Russia's 
active interference in Ukraine's internal affairs; that the 
Internal Affairs Ministry deport Russian cossacks from Ukraine 
and hold those from their formations who committed crimes liable 
under Ukraine's laws; and that DerzhKomKordon [State Committee 
for the Protection of Ukraine's State Border] immediately 
enhance the regime of control at the border and introduce 
Ukrainian entry visas to put an end to the influx of criminal 
elements and prevent the import of drugs and arms.

  [Text] Admiral Feliks Gromov, commander in chief of the 
Russian Navy, in a conversation with journalists, said: Efforts 
by a group of naval experts to estimate the fleet's strength, 
particularly its floating capability, is under way. The 
specialists will determine the parameters for the basis of the 
fleet's division, focusing on the categories of ships and their 
technical condition. Feliks Gromov pointed out that this is not 
a meeting of delegations but work done by experts. The work is 
difficult because every ship has to be examined. 
  About his meeting with Admiral Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy, the 
Ukrainian Naval Forces commander, Feliks Gromov reported that 
their points of view do not coincide, and it is necessary to do 
everything possible to reach a mutual understanding.

  [Text] Kiev [no date as received] -- A delegation of the 
Russian joint stock company Gasprom will hold negotiations in 
Kiev on 3-4 June on Ukraine's payment for Russian gas 
deliveries. Ukrainian Acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy 
is heading the Ukrainian side at the talks. 
  The talks will focus on the possibility of Ukraine building 
houses in Russia and supplying technical resources from its 
enterprises to repay the debt. Gasprom's shareholding in 
Ukrainian companies will also be discussed. The talks are 
likely to raise the issue of setting up joint ventures to use 
Ukrainian gas fields and pipelines, which the Russian side wants 
as part of debt payment. 
  Asked by UNIAN about the Russian position on gas deliveries 
to Ukraine, Vladimir Podmarkov, an engineer of Gasprom's central 
distribution directorate, said it remains unchanged. While 
Russia continues to supply gas to Ukraine even in greater 
amounts than pledged, Ukraine is continuously failing to repay 
the debt. Meanwhile, Russia has repeatedly threatened to suspend 
gas deliveries if Ukraine does not pay what it owes, which since 
the beginning of the year has reached approximately $1 billion. 
  Russia has postponed suspension of deliveries until 
negotiations have been held. At a recent meeting in Moscow, the 
sides decided that Ukraine will collect $150 million from 
enterprises of the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of 
Machine-Building to relieve tension at the next round of talks. 
Ukrgazprom, the Ukrainian company trading with the Russian 
partner, told UNIAN, however, that the money has not been found. 
  Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Vasyl Yevtukhov said in an 
interview for UNIAN that Ukraine's Industry Ministry, which has 
been asked to pay $100 million, does not actually owe anything 
for gas. Meanwhile, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Valentyn 
Landyk met with chiefs of the Ministry of Industry and the 
Ministry of Machine-Building on 2 June to discuss hard currency 
payments for gas.

<F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM correspondent Lev Ryabchikov for TASS] </F>
  [Text] Simferopol June 2 TASS -- The Crimea's local 
parliament disagreed with President Yuriy Meshkov when the 
latter announced on Thursday that following the latest changes 
in the situation on the peninsula, the issue of government 
formation was no longer as urgent as before. Therefore, Meshkov 
said, he did not insist on immediate approval of government 
ministers, but suggested that presidential decrees be given the 
force of law in full compliance with the results of the March 27 
republican referendum. 
  "I believe this proposal need not any discussion, since it 
reflects the people's will and should be put to vote right now. 
The more so as this is critical to the Crimea, for it enables 
to promptly respond to the fast-changing situation in the 
republic and about it", the Crimean president noted. 
  The draft law on legislative acts passed by the president 
provides for endorsement of presidential decrees on issues not 
regulated by the republic's legislation and parliament. 
However, many speakers at today's parliament session pointed 
out that the draft law contradicted the Crimean Constitution and 
allowed the president to put his decrees into force not waiting 
for parliament to approve them. Furthermore, Meshkov has not 
yet signed the Crimea's restored Constitution of May 6, 1992, 
which for this reason cannot be considered effective at the 
moment. 
  After heated debates, the majority of lawmakers representing 
the Rossia faction voted to remove this issue from the agenda. 
  The parliament passed a decision on a three-kilometer-wide 
zone along the coast of both the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, 
in which land plots can be allotted only with parliament 
approval. It was also decided to set up a temporary commission 
to examine all the plots allocated in this zone in the period of 
1992-94 to ensure compliance of their acquisition with law. 
  After that, lawmakers got down to debates over the structure 
of the Crimea's new parliament.

  [Text] Today the Crimean parliament excluded from its 
agenda the issue on giving the force of law to the presidential 
decrees on the issues which were not as yet regulated by 
legislation. A total of 51 deputies voted for this decision 
(the total number of deputies in the Crimean parliament is 98). 
  Earlier, Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov had proposed that 
the Crimean parliament give him additional powers. Meshkov said 
his proposals concerning force of law to be given to the 
presidential decrees was of great importance for Crimea which 
would have more possibilities for quick reaction to the changing 
situation in Crimea and around it.

  According to Andriy Shkil, "active vacation groups" in Lvov 
Oblast have already about 200 volunteers on the rolls. But 
UNA-UNSO is unable to dispatch them to Crimea immediately for

<F P=106> [INTERFAX report: "Kravchuk Proposes Formation of </F>
Constitutional Court To Rescind Illegal Decisions by Crimean 
Authorities"] 
  [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk has proposed 
the formation of a republic Constitutional Court in the near 
future, which would rescind all decisions by the Crimean organs 
of power which, in Kiev's opinion, are illegal. 
  "Under the Constitution the Ukrainian Supreme Council can 
only suspend decisions of the Crimean Supreme Council, not 
rescind them," he stated in the Ukrainian parliament Wednesday. 
  As the president noted, "Crimea must be placed within the 
framework of the Constitution and laws of Ukraine." In his 
opinion, "a party has come to power in Crimea which has 
proclaimed the strategic course of seceding from Ukraine and 
restoring Crimea to Russia." 
  Kiev took a sharply negative view of a recent decision by 
the 
Crimean Supreme Council on restoring the 6 May 1992 version of 
the Constitution of the autonomous republic. This makes 
provision, in particular, for the legal-treaty status of 
relations between Kiev and Simferopol and the possibility for 
Crimeans to obtain dual citizenship. 
  L. Kravchuk proposed that the Supreme Council make 
amendments 
to the law on delimitation of powers between Kiev and 
Simferopol, "making provision for an expansion of the powers of 
the Crimean organs of power." At the same time the president 
deems it necessary to amend the laws on the security service and 
the militia. The power structures throughout Ukraine should be 
under central jurisdiction alone, he noted. 
  In L. Kravchuk's opinion a subcommission should be set up in 
the Ukrainian parliament "to deal only with Crimean problems." 
At the same time he expressed agreement with the proposal to 
introduce in the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers the post of vice 
premier for territorial questions. 
  L. Kravchuk also pointed to the need speedily to resolve the 
problem of the Black Sea Fleet, including "the question of 
dispersing the Ukrainian and Russian fleets to their bases and 
clearly defining the status of the Black Sea Fleet on Ukraine's 
territory." "This will have a considerable positive effect on 
the situation in Crimea," he said.

<F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM special correspondent Sergey Balykov </F>
for TASS] 
  [Text] Simferopol June 2 TASS -- "We are strongly convinced 
that any use of force in dialogue with the Crimea is 
unacceptable. We would like to solve problems and not to exert 
pressure, to cooperate and not to inspect and supervise", said 
Vladimir Butkevich, head of the Ukrainian Parliament's 
Commission for Human Rights, National Minorities and 
Inter-Ethnic Relations. 
  Butkevich, who is also a U.N. expert in human rights, leads 
a 
Ukrainian parliamentary delegation that arrived on Thursday in 
the Crimea for talks with local lawmakers. 
  The delegation comprises members of parliament's various 
commissions and experts. A similar working group, headed by the 
republic's Deputy Parliament Speaker Aleksey Melnikov, was set 
up by the Crimean side. 
  Later in the day, the two delegations met at the negotiating 
table. They are to discuss and bring in line Crimean and 
Ukrainian legislations, to tackle some sensitive economic, legal 
and other issues. The talks following up the Kiev dialogue are 
attended by representatives of the Crimean president and 
government. Nevertheless, Butkevich noted, the Crimean leaders 
understand quite well the dangerous character of the situation 
and are ready to work in close cooperation to solve the common 
problems. We do not have any antagonistic contradictions, he 
stressed. We should remember that the Crimea is an integral 
part of Ukraine, that we are members of the same family, the 
same state, therefore all issues should be solved in a quiet and 
civilized manner. We need another several months to find 
necessary solutions, Butkevich went on to say. But I am 
confident that the current meeting will set a constructive 
beginning to this process, he stressed. 
  The meeting in the Crimean capital Simferopol will 
concentrate on possible ways to bridge the existing discrepancy 
between the Crimean and Ukrainian Constitutions, as well as to 
improve relations between Ukraine and its constituent republic. 
Under Crimean laws, relations with Ukraine should be built on a 
treaty basis, while Ukrainian legislation does not provide for 
any federated arrangement. Also raised at the talks will be the 
issue of dual citizenship. 
  Although both delegations are eager to undo the existing 
knot 
of contradictions, the talks are expected to be rather tense. 
They will be certainly lobbied by local pro-Russian forces, 
whose activists gathered outside the Crimean parliamentary 
building to express their attitude towards the arriving 
Ukrainian delegation.

  [Text] Simferopol -- On 2 June, Max van der Stoel, the CSCE 
high commissioner for minorities, who has visited Ukraine three 
times over the past six months, met Mustafa Dzhemilev, head of 
the Majlis of the Crimean Tatar people. During a discussion on 
the status of the Crimean Tatars in Crimea, the possibility of 
extending aid to the Crimean Tatars along CSCE lines was 
discussed. It was decided to render such aid to Ukraine as a 
whole, however, within the framework of a program targeted at 
Crimean Tatars. 
  Max van der Stoel had his second meeting with Crimean Deputy 
Prime Minister Yevgeniy Saburov. Summing up the results at the 
request of a UNIAN correspondent, Saburov pointed out that the 
talks were, first and foremost, about the status of Russians in 
Crimea, because Russians are a national minority in Ukraine. 
According to Saburov, he "told Max van der Stoel about the 
pressure exerted by the leadership of Ukraine." 
  Saburov also commented on the outcome of the sitting of the 
International Trade Club, which took place last week in Crimea. 
He reported that the trade representatives of the embassies 
sent a letter of thanks for the warm reception, and declared 
that the representatives of business circles who arrived in 
Crimea got the impression that the conflict there is not a 
result of some ethnic processes but just as a result of a 
conflict between political elites. Saburov underlined: "I am 
glad that the representatives of the embassies left Crimea as 
our supporters." 
  On the same day, Max van der Stoel met Serhiy Tsekov, 
chairman of the Supreme Council of Crimea and Leonid Hrach, 
first secretary of the Communist Party of Crimea. 
  On 3 June, the CSCE High Commissioner Max van der Stoel is 
expected to arrive in Kiev where he will meet the Ukrainian 
president.

Mikhail Melnik] 
  [Text] Kiev June 3 TASS -- Ukrainian acting prime minister, 
parliament member Yukhym Zvyahilskyy today called on the Supreme 
Soviet of Ukraine to take the most resolute measures to defend 
the national interests of the state. He urged it to investigate 
in detail the attempt on the life of parliament member Vladimir 
Bortnik, to ensure law and order, and to set up an effective 
legal mechanism for this purpose. 
  "An outrageous attempt on the life of Vladimir Bortnik, 
Ukrainian parliament member and president of a state concern 
providing material and technical supplies and services to the 
country's agro-industrial complex, was committed on May 30," 
Zvyahilskyy said. 
  "The Ukrainian political and state leader was gravely 
wounded 
by five bullets fired pointblank by hired killers. His life is 
in danger." 
  "The anti-state mafiosi structures," Zvyahilskyy stressed, 
"which have lost the elections, are now unleashing a reign of 
terror against the state and the people. It is not without 
reason that the killers have chosen Vladimir Bortnik as their 
victim. He had opposed attempts to rob Ukraine, refusing to buy 
oil products and other materials for agriculture at prices, 
dictated by the mafia. 
  "The brazen attempt on the life of Ukrainian parliament 
member Vladimir Bortnik, committed in broad daylight in the very 
centre of Kiev, shows that even the first frail sprouts of 
economic and political stability in Ukraine and the 
government-planned course of gradually raising the people's 
living standards infuriate the anti-state groupings and mafiosi 
structures, which are used to shamelessly robbing our country 
and our people. They have repeatedly threatened to make short 
work of members of the government and me personally, as acting 
premier of Ukraine. Now they have gone over from threats to 
outright terror." 
  "The impunity with which the anti-state mafiosi groupings 
had 
acted so far," Zvyahilskyy said, "cannot be tolerated any 
longer, because this threatens the national security of Ukraine 
and the vital interests of our citizens."

  [Excerpts] Kiev [no date as received] -- A session of the 
parliament on 2 June examined a resolution "On the Ukrainian 
president's proposal to the Supreme Council on postponement of 
the election of the president of Ukraine, local councils, and 
local council chairmen scheduled for 26 June 1994." The 
resolution says that, taking into account the current 
preparations for the elections, as well as the fact that 
postponement of the election would affect social and economic 
reforms, postponement of the election is deemed inexpedient. 
The resolution instructs the Supreme Council Commission for 
Legal Policy and Legal and Judicial Reform and the Commission 
for State-building, Council Activities, and Self-government to 
submit before 12 June proposals to the parliament regarding 
draft laws regulating the powers of the president of Ukraine, 
the government, and local authorities. [passage omitted] 
  Despite calls from deputies who wanted to make remarks on 
the voting procedure, Oleksandr Tkachenko, first deputy Supreme 
Council chairman (Oleksandr Moroz is informally reported on sick 
leave), put the draft resolution to a vote, and 201 voted to 
adopt it in principle. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Leonid Kuchma, former Prime Minister of </F>
Ukraine and incumbent President of the Ukrainian Union of 
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, by Boris Sverdlov; in Kiev, 
date not given: "Leonid Kuchma: Ukraine Cannot Manage Without 
Economic Alliance With Russia"] 
  [Text] Kiev -- Former Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma, who is 
currently president of the Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and 
Entrepreneurs, is one of the most popular figures in the 
republic. Some people -- and they constitute a majority -- are 
ready to support Leonid Danilovich without hesitation in the 
presidential election despite serious failings in the economy 
under his government. Others -- they, too, are fairly numerous 
-- place virtually every catastrophe ever to have befallen 
Ukraine at his door. While the mass media never tire of forging 
an antihero out of him. Nevertheless, at this point in time he 
is firmly rooted on the front row of the ratings grid, shunting 
L. Kravchuk into second place. Kuchma himself attributes this 
to the following: 
  [Kuchma] I have always spoken the truth; indeed, I always do 
speak the truth. It may not be very nice, but it is the truth. 
Most people like to hear the truth, but not everyone. Can you 
really tell me that my assertion that we cannot survive without 
economic alliance with Russia will please those who envisage a 
Ukraine geared toward the West? Or else I am reproached 
nowadays with not having had a clear idea of the type of state 
which we are building -- socialist, or capitalist -- while 
executing the duties of head of the government. In actual fact 
I did not know, and I was not ashamed to ask the legislators 
about this in public. 
  [Sverdlov] What do you think of the new Ukrainian 
parliament? 
  [Kuchma] My position is known. I would like to see the 
Supreme Council occupied not so much with politics as with 
economics. Unfortunately, many representatives from political 
parties were elected to it. On the one hand the parliament is 
too right-wing, and on the other it is too left-wing. If the 
extremes fail to meet each other halfway, Ukraine will lie idle 
for a long time yet. The managerial corps acceded to 
legislative power in too weak a condition. However, there are 
many deputies in parliament who are ready to devote their 
efforts entirely to reviving the economy. I pin great hopes on 
them. 
  [Sverdlov] You are aware that a consultative poll of the 
population was conducted in the Donbass during the elections. 
The overwhelming majority expressed support for Ukraine's entry 
into the Commonwealth of Independent States, a federal 
structure, and the attribution to Russian of the status of the 
second state language. Do you share their point of view? 
  [Kuchma] I have advocated and still advocate Ukraine's entry 
into the CIS. Nobody is waiting to receive us in the West as 
yet. Especially with the quality of goods being produced at 
current levels. Which is why it is essential to make every 
effort to support integration toward the East. Yet we are doing 
everything possible to prevent this. It is very easy to lose 
the sales market in Russia. There will be states poised to fill 
the niche. Indeed, they are already filling the gaps. It is 
far harder to conquer the market afterward. Indeed, once it 
gets used to doing without us, Russia will hardly want to begin 
focusing attention on us again. In this respect I am in complete 
sympathy with the Donbass people. As, indeed, I am on the point 
of the regions' possessing greater autonomy. I stated this on 
the very first day after Ukraine acquired independence. As for 
the language problem, I believe that the state language should 
be just Ukrainian, but that the official languages should be 
Russian and Ukrainian. 
  [Sverdlov] What is the difference? 
  [Kuchma] The state language is the language of diplomacy and 
law. Official languages apply in every other sphere. 
  [Sverdlov] It became known recently that you advocate 
setting up a party of industrialists and entrepreneurs. Have 
you set about fulfilling this task? 
  [Kuchma] Without an influential party of industrialists and 
entrepreneurs, it is very difficult to resolve questions of 
reforming the economy. And we will set up such a party in the 
very near future. There are many deputies in the new parliament 
with a tremendous desire to top up the ranks of our party, and 
this will open the way to forming the type of government which 
will not be in awe of the Supreme Council. 
  [Sverdlov] What economic program will you be taking to the 
presidential election? 
  [Kuchma] Look first at what is happening with the republic 
economy. In the first quarter of this year alone industrial 
output fell by one third. In the machine-building sector it 
fell by 40 percent. Hundreds of enterprises have ground to a 
halt. And both the domestic and foreign debts have hit 
astronomical figures. 
  My program for getting out of the crisis is primarily the 
program of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. As 
for the first steps, it is above all necessary to loosen 
taxation on commodity producers. They are quite simply being 
suffocated by them. Accounting by promissory note [vekselnyy 
zachet] should also be carried out between enterprises, as this 
will provide an opportunity to identify bankruptcies. Some of 
these enterprises, having no future, will have to be shut down, 
while others will have to be retooled. And of course, we should 
renounce the fixed rate for the karbovanets against the dollar, 
which renders all our output for export loss-making. 
  [Sverdlov] But if you are gunning for bankruptcies, then it 
follows, for instance, that coal enterprises first and foremost 
must be cut back. It is these enterprises which are currently 
up to their eyeballs in debt. 
  [Kuchma] The wisdom of any government resides in its skill 
in forecasting. Otherwise the hatchets could come down too 
vigorously! Yes, the coal enterprises in Ukraine are 
loss-making. However, we have no other fuel. Which means that 
investment and state support are necessary. 
  [Sverdlov] Today many people are stressing the inexpediency 
of holding a presidential election. What is your view on this 
score? 
  [Kuchma] There is a law, and it should be observed. There 
are no grounds for calling off the presidential election.

<F P=106> [Statement by the faction of Ukraine's communists; place and </F>
date not given] 
  [Text] For over three years, Ukraine, which became an 
independent state, has been suffering from inflation, hunger, 
poverty, paralysis of production, and the degradation of 
science, culture, and moral principles. During this period, the 
economic policy was senseless, helpless, and antinational. Only 
three years more of such policy are required to make Ukraine a 
source of raw materials, cheap labor, and to turn it into a 
underdeveloped colony. Let us recall who is the initiator and 
the advocate of this sycophantic policy. 
  From the very beginning of the existence of the former 
Supreme Council, V. M. Pylypchuk, O. S. Emelyanov, and V. M. 
Pynzenyk played an active part in imposing the principles of 
market reforms. Their program foresaw the "liberalization" of 
prices, privatization of state enterprises, and the introduction 
of a national currency. This program praised the price policy of 
a "shock therapy" -- imposed on Russia and Ukraine -- which 
became a lever for robbing people. 
  In March 1992, the president submitted "Fundamentals of 
National Economic Policy" for consideration by the Supreme 
Council. Former presidential adviser O. S. Emelyanov headed the 
drafting collective. Former instructor V. M. Pynzenyk and other 
persons also participated in drafting this program. V. M. 
Pylypchuk, chairman of Supreme Council commission for economic 
reforms, supported this program in its entirety. Key principles 
of this program are as follows: 
  1. Russia is an enemy. It is necessary to isolate Ukraine 
from Russia as soon as possible. This could lead to the 
disruption of contacts and stoppages of deliveries, and to a 
crisis in wholesale prices; 
  2. It is necessary to introduce a national currency as soon 
as possible (though it is not covered by goods or currency 
reserves!); 
  3. It is necessary to introduce a system of clearing 
accounting between the CIS states (which halted deliveries and 
thus triggered a payment crisis what cost Ukraine losses in the 
multibillions). 
  4. It is necessary to reorient the Ukrainian economy toward 
integration with the West (nothing comes of this, because 
entering new markets requires constant effort). These mindless 
adventurous measures complicated a situation in Ukraine that was 
already difficult. 
  Meanwhile, V. G. Lanovyy -- who worked in the 
cost-accounting 
laboratory at a state enterprise, and later headed the 
department at the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences Institute of 
Economics -- appears on the scene. V. M. Pylypchuk and V. G. 
Lanovyy were involved in the introduction of tear-off coupons. 
All of a sudden, an abstract dogmatist became minister of 
economy and vice prime minister dealing with the reforms. He 
drafted a regular populist thick "program," the essence of which 
was narrowed to the illusory plans regarding privatization and 
liberalization of prices. Nobody took this program seriously 
because it did not correspond to Ukrainian reality. The program 
did not contain anything revolutionary or original. V. G. 
Lanovyy was dismissed because of his absolute inefficiency. 
However, currently, he depicts himself as a discredited fighter 
for reforms. There is nothing new in this. All populists 
behave this way. Rukh also suffers from the same illness. 
  V. M. Pynzenyk, a theoretician of the same ilk, became 
minister of economy and vice prime minister dealing with 
implementing reforms. Therefore, his first moves -- the 
untimely withdrawal from the ruble zone, the recommendation that 
the National Bank chairman, who voiced doubts over the 
opportunity to quickly introduce new money, resign -- present 
nothing strange. He opposed union with Russia and CIS states. 
He and his friends drafted several dozens of programs and 
finally put the economy into a state of confusion. 
  Beginning in late 1992, he embarked on a wild increase in 
prices which continued until January 1993. He also drafted 
three projects addressing the implementation of the 
"Fundamentals of National Economic Policy." Due to the lack of 
time, L. D. Kuchma had to submit the third draft -- without 
reading or introducing amendments -- for consideration by the 
Supreme Council. 
  V. M. Pylypchuk, V. M. Pynzenyk, and V. G. Lanovyy did not 
consider the economic and social situation in Ukraine and 
advocated primitive measures, which they borrowed, first of all, 
from U.S. theories. All their reforms are reduced to one 
concept: liberalization of prices, introduction of free foreign 
trade, quick privatization, sale of land, bankruptcy of 
loss-bringing enterprises and collective agricultural 
collectives, and restoration of tough money and credit policy to 
oppose inflation. Life showed that all this is harmful to 
Ukraine. 
  The international conference -- devoted to market reforms -- 
was held from 19 to 23 May in Ukraine. This was, in fact, a 
political meeting, which was attended by all avid proponents of 
shock therapy: Sachs, Balcerovicz, and others. Ukraine was 
represented by our "heroes" V. M. Pylypchuk, V. M. Pynzenyk, and 
V. G. Lanovyy. 
  Ukrainian representatives of alternative economic methods 
did 
not participate in the conference. U.S. "professors" called for 
not protecting the Ukrainian economy from the crisis but 
allowing it to undergo "structural changes" prompted by blows 
arising from the crisis in sales and payments. 
  Only when V. M. Pynzenyk and V. G. Lanovyy were dismissed 
and 
V. M. Pylypchuk bridled his energy by being unable to think 
realistically and in connection with launching an election 
campaign, the statements that inflation could be kept down and 
on the crisis in payments and production was challenged. 
  Minister of Economy R. V. Shpek also tries to continue the 
implementation of the Western wild market policy. According to 
him, even state regulation means liberalization of prices (we 
cite him!). Under his office, the Ministry of Economy turned 
into an unimportant department for carrying out propaganda. 
  V. M. Pynzenyk, V. G. Lanovyy, M. Pylypchuk, and R. V. Shpek 
make attempts to become real compradors, and encourage the 
policy of states-colonizers. All their reforms are new versions 
of primitive Western recipes that do not take Ukrainian 
conditions into consideration. They are pushing our people into 
poverty and Ukraine -- to a colonial dependence. They cannot 
become leaders of Supreme Council economic commissions.

TASS] 
  [Text] Dnepropetrovsk June 2 TASS -- Speaking at an 
election meeting in the mining academy on Thursday, Ivan 
Plyushch, Ukrainian presidential candidate and former parliament 
speaker, called for tough economic measures. 
  "The time for mild decisions has gone. Tough measures are 
need to avoid cruel and repressive ones," he said. 
  Plyushch believes that it is necessary first of all to form 
a 
team of like-minded people in the new parliament to shoulder the 
entire responsibility. He is convinced that to do that there is 
no need to enter into confrontation or reorganise the new 
parliament. It is necessary simply to make competent use of 
those powers which the old one granted to the executive branch, 
he pointed out. 
  The presidential candidate is of the opinion that it does 
not 
basically matter whom the Cabinet of Ministers would be 
accountable to -- the premier or the president. It is important 
that firm executive power be wielded by one body and act 
effectively. 
  Plyushch is confident that in order to get the first sprouts 
of stabilisation now, it is enough to liberalise production, 
including foreign economic activities, reinstate the law on the 
state enterprise, bring into the operation the law on foreign 
activities and foreign investments and see to it that the 
production demonopolisation mechanism begins to operate and the 
law on the banking system is upgraded.

  [Text] [No dateline as received] -- Viktor Semenov, head of 
the Sevastopol city council of people's deputies, stated at a 
news conference on 2 June that two fleets cannot be stationed in 
Sevastopol. He backed up his opinion by saying that the 
servicemen of Ukraine's naval forces and those of the Black Sea 
Fleet are "biologically incompatible." Also, Viktor Semenov 
referred to the statements by the defense ministers of Ukraine 
and Russia, in which they called relations between the 
servicemen of the two fleets normal, as misinforming journalists 
and the public. 
  In this connection, the press center of Ukraine's naval 
forces made public a statement, which, in particular, says: 
"Admitting the fact that Semenov has the right to express his 
personal opinion, the press center of Ukraine's naval forces is 
at the same time authorized to declare that such statements by 
an official, who is a member of the military council of 
Ukraine's naval forces, are of a provocative nature and they do 
not promote the negotiating process on the Black Sea Fleet. 
Objectively, the servicemen of Ukraine's naval forces and the 
Black Sea Fleet, who have for many years been serving together, 
cannot have differences; moreover, relations between them cannot 
be brought down to a "biological" level. The above statement 
can turn political problems between Ukraine and Russia relating 
to the Black Sea Fleet into interethnic problems whose 
consequences can hardly be predicted." 
  The command of Ukraine's naval forces is also surprised and 
indignant over a statement by the head of the city council to 
the effect that "the Sevastopol naval institute is vacant" and 
over the "groundless proposals" concerning the further use of 
its base. The statement by the press center of the naval forces 
of Ukraine indicates that the educational process is now under 
way at the institute and all the institute's funds will be 
further used in the interests of building Ukraine's naval forces. 
  The statement by the press center of Ukraine's naval forces 
expresses the conviction that "no ill-considered statements by 
politicians can stir up enmity between the servicemen of 
Ukraine's naval forces and the Black Sea Fleet. As far as 
political issues are concerned, these are to be tackled by 
politicians."

  [Text] [No dateline as received] -- A survey conducted by 
the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences 
reveals a troubled demographic situation in Ukraine. Birth rate 
has fallen from 12.1 children per 1,000 residents in 1991 to 
10.8 per 1,000 in 1993. The number of deaths per 1,000 has 
risen from 12.9 in 1991 to 14.2 in 1993, twice exceeding 
mortality rates in Western Europe, Canada, and Japan. 
Population growth rate in the past three years has been 
negative. In 1991, the growth indicator was (- 0.8), in 1992 
(- 1.9), and in 1993 (- 3.4) per 1,000. 
  Child mortality is far above the European average. In early 
1994, death rate among children was 14.4 per 1,000, with the 
average rate in developed countries at 3.5 to 7.0 per 1,000. 
Only 30 percent of Ukrainian babies are born healthy.

  [Text] Moscow June 3 TASS -- "The federal Democratic Russia 
Party is farther apart from the authorities than the Russia's 
Choice party. Politically, the Democratic Russia Party is 
closer to the centre than the Russia's Choice," co-chairman of 
the Democratic Russia movement Lev Ponomarev, whose idea it was 
to set up a new party, told ITAR-TASS. 
  According to Ponomarev, the party, which is now being set up 
by Yegor Gaydar, i.e. the Russia's Choice party, would most 
likely be a bourgeois-type organisation, while the Democratic 
Russia Party regards itself as a "right-wing social-democratic 
party in the Western sense of the term", and will "contribute to 
the social adaptation of the population to the ongoing reforms", 
will combat bureaucracy. 
  Ponomarev explained that the Democratic Russia Party was "in 
a way a party of the opposition". It is in opposition to the 
government, especially to the local authorities in the 
provinces, but not to the president, whom the party still 
regards as the "locomotive of reforms". "We dare oppose the 
authorities to a greater extent than the Russia's Choice party. 
We have not signed the social concord agreement, while Gaydar 
did it," Ponomarev stated. 
  "The Democratic Russia Party relies on the backing of the 
same social groups as the Russia's Choice, that is the 
intellectuals, small and medium-size businessmen, and it will 
inevitably compete with Gaydar's party for influence on these 
sections of the population," Ponomarev noted. "As to the already 
existing organisational foundation of the Democratic Russia 
movement, Ponomarev said that it had split between the two new 
parties. In some places most of the members of the movement's 
regional organisations had joined the Russia's Choice party (for 
instance, in Archangel), but in most of the regions they decided 
to join the Democratic Russia Party. He said that in Moscow the 
membership of the Democratic Russia movement had split between 
the two parties almost equally. 
  Ponomarev believes that in spite of all their current 
differences, the democrats were obliged to nominate one common 
candidate to the post of president during the future elections. 
"We do not plan to nominate our own candidate. We shall do 
everything we can to have one common candidate from all the 
democratic forces," he stressed.

<F P=106> ["Contradictions Must Be Settled at Elections, Telman </F>
Gdlyan, Cochairman of the People's Party of Russia, Believes" -- 
ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI headline] 
  [Text] There are a lot of people who doubt the possibility 
of maintaining civil peace in the country. I do not share these 
doubts. I am convinced that society is mature enough to 
understand the dangers which we have recently come up against. 
Now individual sections of this society will no longer opt for 
sharp confrontation, understanding that this is too dangerous 
and is liable to result in self-destruction. They must not 
cross this line. 
  Therefore, in my estimation, no matter how much our boat is 
tossed about, we will successfully get through the period until 
1995, and will settle our contradictions at the next 
parliamentary elections. I think that we will also live to see 
the next presidential elections. If we cross these two bridges, 
then we will smoothly cross over into a normal constitutional 
system of rule. 
  I believe that everyone who signed the Social Accord Treaty 
in Russia should strive for this. It should be understood that 
the treaty is not a code which contains sharp restrictions, it 
does not demand things from its participants which should not be 
demanded -- such as giving up ideological and political 
convictions. Ideological and political differences will 
undoubtedly remain, but this document contains a main, pivotal 
thing: Agreement not to resort to violence in the political 
struggle under any circumstances. And that is the main thing 
that should unite society.

<F P=106> [Lyubov Tsukanova commentary: "Uncontrolled Sovereignty Is </F>
Unpredictable. But This Is Better Than Standing Still"] 
  [Text] During his visit to Tatarstan, President Yeltsin 
drew the conclusion that he had been right in the first place to 
offer republics within the Russian Federation as much 
sovereignty as "they could swallow." The basis for this 
conclusion is a bilateral treaty recently signed between Russia 
and the Republic of Tatarstan, which determines the volume of 
republic powers on the one hand and federal powers on the other 
hand. As Boris Yeltsin noted, the treaty has enshrined the real 
volume of powers which the republic is in a position to digest. 
However, judging by the worried face of Mintimer Shaymiyev, the 
process of "digestion" is proceeding with difficulty, and he 
briefly outlined the reason for this in his reply: "Mechanisms 
are needed..." Following on from this by association, what this 
means is that anything can be swallowed, but in order to avoid 
indigestion, sovereignty must be "chewed" properly. That is, 
totally specific organizational mechanisms of interaction 
between the center and the component of the Federation must be 
thought out and elaborated. As usual, this is difficult. And 
as extremely long discussions went on at one time about the 
mechanism of the implementation of the Federation Treaty, which 
was not elaborated in the end anyway, so now there is -- 
evidently on Tatarstan's part, first and foremost -- strong 
concern about ensuring that the bilateral treaty does not remain 
a political declaration only. 
  The meeting between Boris Yeltsin and Mintimer Shaymiyev 
should be a guarantee of the fact that steps to regulate 
economic problems will follow on from the political achievements 
of the treaty (and these are real: Elections to the Russian 
Federation Federal Assembly have been held in Tatarstan). The 
economic problems are no less real and alarming: Mutual tax 
relations have not been established, which is worrying the 
federal government first and foremost, as it is not receiving 
the full complement of taxes from Tatarstan; the republic, for 
its part, is not satisfied with the fact that the center has so 
far done nothing to ensure that the demarcation of powers has 
moved from "paper" to practical deeds. 
  Admittedly, the creation of a bilateral commission to 
monitor 
the implementation of the treaty has been announced. But no 
commission in our country has ever been a guarantee that things 
will get moving. In a specific case, perhaps only direct 
support to a given problem on the part of Russian Government 
Vice Premier Sergey Shakhray, who, as we know, promoted the 
treaty on the center's side, may serve as a guarantee. 
  The Russian Federation president expressed the hope that the 
outline for mutual relations between Moscow and Kazan will 
constitute the basis for settling problems between the center 
and other components of the Federation which are aspiring to 
autonomy. He has Chechnya primarily in mind. But today, 
Bashkiria, Tuva, and a number of "self-sufficient" krays and 
oblasts are aspiring to the Tatarstan model. Evidently, the 
process of formulating bilateral treaties will be widened, 
although it has a lot of opponents, according to whom this will 
mean a transition from a constitutional federation to a 
treaty-based one. This problem has not been solved on a 
theoretical level, and will most likely not be solved in the 
near future. The construction of the federation, like a lot of 
other things, is proceeding by the method of "feeling your way." 
"The digestion of sovereignty" by the republics is proceeding in 
an uncontrolled way, with a multitude of negative side-effects 
which no one is analyzing properly at state level. Krays and 
oblasts, which have recently been pinning more and more hopes on 
regional unification within historically established economic 
areas, are moving along the experimental path toward greater 
independence. What this will turn into, no one can say today. 
The only thing that is clear is that the more the federal 
powers, both executive and legislative, delay in settling 
regional problems, the fewer the chances are that the 
construction of the federation will proceed along a normal, 
constructive path, without any nasty surprises for Moscow.

intelligence service denied Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev's 
allegations on Wednesday that Russian secret services are 
planning to stage a local nuclear explosion in the Chechen 
Republic. 
  "Such statements are absurd," foreign intelligence 
spokeswoman Tatyana Samolis said. 
  Dudayev said on Chechen television that following the failed 
attempt on his life, Russian secret services may stage a local 
nuclear blast. He also said that should this happen, they will 
then accuse the Chechen Republic, saying that it possesses a 
nuclear component.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>
  [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] 2 June TASS -- Turkish President 
Suleyman Demirel, currently paying an official three-day visit 
to Moldavia [Moldova], went today to the southern part of the 
Republic, mostly inhabited by Gagauzs, a people of Turkic 
origin. He is accompanied by President Mircea Snegur and other 
officials. 
  Demirel stated the day before that Turkish businessmen were 
ready to invest in the Moldavian economy. Most of the 
investments will be made in the Gagauz districts. At the same 
time, he expressed his support to the efforts of the Moldavian 
leadership to ensure the Republic's territorial integrity. 
  "We back the negotiations process between the Gagauz 
population and the Moldavian central leadership, intended to 
give our brothers a chance to live on their native land as 
citizens, who respect the territorial integrity of Moldavia and 
enjoy a legal status making for their further development," 
Demirel stated. 
  The Gagauz leaders also pin great hopes on Demirel's visit. 
"This visit will, without a doubt, contribute to the political 
settlement of the Gagauz problem. This will allow us to switch 
over to the solution of our economic problems, to the 
improvement of the people's living standards," ITAR-TASS was 
told by Stepan Topal, the president of Gagauzia. 
  According to the Gagauz leader, the Turkish side is ready to 
help develop telephone services in the Gagauz districts, to 
build roads there, and to re-equip the local processing 
enterprises and other factories. 
  Demirel will sign with Moldavian President Mircea Snegur a 
treaty of friendship and cooperation between the two countries. 
Several agreements on cooperation in the sphere of culture, 
transport services, agriculture, and in combatting crime will 
also be concluded. The heads of the two states are expected to 
decide the terms for large Turkish investments in the Moldavian 
economy. On the last day of the visit Demirel will attend the 
opening of the Turkish Embassy in Moldavia, after which the 
signing of the official documents will take place.

  [Text] Tallinn, June 02, BNS -- Russian military who want 
to enter Estonia must present alongside with visa application 
the timetable for the withdrawal of the unit they serve in. 
Also, a Russian serviceman headed for Estonia must inform 
Estonian authorities about his concrete task in the withdrawal 
process. 
  Anatoly Chizhikov, the military attache at the Russian 
embassy in Tallinn, told BNS the embassy received May 12 from 
the Estonian Foreign Ministry a description of the procedure 
established to control the entrance of Russian military into 
Estonia, which contains the stipulation concerning the 
withdrawal timetable. Chizhikov said it is "absolutely 
unacceptable" to the Russian side, especially with regard to the 
higher command of the Baltic Fleet or the Northwest Army Group. 
  "It would mean that the commander in chief of the Baltic 
Fleet or the Northwest Army Group would upon entering Estonia 
have to present a schedule for the pullout of all fleet or army 
units, respectively. The government delegations have for two 
years been unable to reach agreement on the timetables, and now 
it is demanded from servicemen," the Russian officer said. 
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Juri Arusoo told BNS that the 
ministry indeed sent May 10 a note to the Russian Embassy to 
regulate the order of entrance into Estonia of Russian military. 
Arusoo said the reason behind the note was that "trips by the 
military became too frequent, so (we wanted) to make sure they 
wouldn't be to-ing and fro-ing for no reason." Arusoo explained 
the demand to present the timetable only applies to "military 
men of a certain level." 
  "Of course exceptions can be made to every rule and the 
higher command are not required to present upon entrance to 
Estonia the schedule for the withdrawal of all units under 
them," the Foreign Ministry spokesman said.

<F P=106> [AZERTADZH report: "All-Around Expansion of Mutually </F>
Profitable Cooperation"] 
  [Text] On 23 May President of Azerbaijan Geydar Aliyev 
received Tim Eggar, minister of energy of Great Britain, who was 
in Baku in connection with the opening here on 24 May of an 
international exhibition on oil and gas production in the 
Caspian. 
  In the course of the discussion G. Aliyev and T. Eggar 
expressed a mutual interest in the development and expansion of 
economic cooperation between Azerbaijan and Britain. 
  G. Aliyev expressed satisfaction at the fact that the 
agreements on cooperation between the two countries achieved in 
the course of his visit to Britain, in the energy sphere 
particularly, had undergone development. He termed such 
cooperation highly promising, considering the enormous oil and 
gas potential of Azerbaijan. In the president's opinion, this is 
a very attractive factor for investments on the part of foreign 
companies, in which the republic, in turn, is interested. 
  Citing information of the State Petroleum Company, G. Aliyev 
told T. Eggar of the successful completion on 20 May in Istanbul 
of the latest round of negotiations on the joint development 
with foreign oil companies of the Azeri and Chyrag fields, which 
had brought the possibility of the conclusion of contracts 
closer. The international exhibition organized by British 
companies and the Trade and Industry Chamber of Azerbaijan, 
which is opening in Baku, will contribute to this, the head of 
state believes. 
  T. Eggar termed the upcoming exhibition a very important 
event. This is recognized in many countries, Britain included. 
The British minister observed that his country attaches great 
significance to the agreements with Azerbaijan signed in London 
and expressed satisfaction in connection with the results of the 
negotiations in Turkey, emphasizing that the oil companies would 
continue to make every effort for the speediest conclusion of 
contracts. At the same time, according to T. Eggar, London 
recognizes the great possibilities of cooperation with 
Azerbaijan not only in the sphere of oil and gas production but 
in other spheres also, specifically, telecommunications and iron 
and steel industry. 
  The reception was attended by Fuad Guliyev, first deputy 
prime minister of Azerbaijan, State Counselor Vafa Gulizade, 
Gasan Gasanov, minister of foreign affairs of Azerbaijan, Natik 
Aliyev, president of the State Petroleum Company of the 
Azerbaijani Republic, representatives of foreign oil companies 
in Azerbaijan, and Thomas Young, ambassador of Great Britain in 
Azerbaijan. 
  Tim Eggar, minister of energy of Great Britain, was received 
by Rasul Guliyev, chairman of the Supreme Council of Azerbaijan. 
The head of parliament emphasized the importance of the 
development of cooperation between the two countries. 
  Tim Eggar expressed satisfaction at the successful progress 
of the negotiations on the joint development with foreign 
companies of the fields in the shelf of the Caspian and 
emphasized that his country recognized the need for economic 
contacts and cooperation with Azerbaijan. 
  There was a meeting between Gasan Gasanov, minister of 
foreign affairs of Azerbaijan, and British Energy Minister Tim 
Eggar. The pair exchanged opinions on the prospects of the 
development of bilateral relations. In the British minister's 
opinion, important landmarks in a strengthening of these were 
the opening of the Embassy of Azerbaijan in London and the visit 
of the head of the Azerbaijani state to Britain. 
  The leader of the foreign policy department of the republic 
familiarized the guest with the situation in Azerbaijan that had 
taken shape as a result of Armenia's continuing aggression. Ways 
of settling the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict within the CSCE 
framework were discussed. 
  Questions of the two countries' cooperation in the sphere of 
the joint development of the oil fields in Azerbaijan were 
broached at the meeting also. As Tim Eggar declared, his country 
is prepared, together with participation in the development of 
the oil fields in the shelf of the Caspian and the humanitarian 
aid that it has already granted Azerbaijan, to render the 
republic assistance in the development of the infrastructure of 
the economy and the elaboration of the legislative basis of 
market reforms and to transfer to it the latest technology and 
equipment. 
  According to G. Gasanov, Britain is a most important 
economic 
partner of Azerbaijan. The minister of foreign affairs of the 
republic expressed the Azerbaijani side's readiness to develop 
the two countries' relations in other spheres also and to 
participate in the elaboration of joint cooperation programs. 
  Representatives of British Petroleum, the Kayser Engineering 
Company, and others were present at the meeting.

  [Text] Riga, Jun 01, BNS -- The Latvian National 
Independence Movement faction refuses to participate in the 
expression of confidence or no confidence to Foreign Minister 
Georgs Andrejevs, faction head Alexander Kirsteins told 
reporters Wednesday. The faction believes that Andrejevs cannot 
occupy the ministerial post after having confessed to ties with 
the notorious Soviet security police, KGB. 
  Kirsteins also approached the issue from the ethical 
viewpoint saying that Andrejevs cheated the parliament since 
deputy candidates vowed non-collaboration with foreign security 
structures before the 5th Saeima [parliament] elections. 
  The Homeland and Freedom faction will give a vote of no 
confidence to Andrejevs because he formally violated the 
election law, its head Maris Grinblats said. Grinblats, 
however, praised Andrejevs for his confession and said that 
Andrejevs may be telling the truth when he claims his KGB ties 
were limited. 
  The Equality of Rights faction will also vote to express no 
confidence to Andrejevs because his infringement of the election 
law could become a precedent for further irregularities, said 
faction Deputy Chairwoman Larisa Lavina. 
  The Political Association of Economists deputies oppose the 
consideration of the issue before the decision of the court on 
Andrejevs KGB ties. The faction also considers that Andrejevs 
fitness to the post is in the government competence. 
  The Democratic Party faction approved free vote on the 
issue, 
said its member Alfreds Cepanis.

<F P=106> [Speech by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk to Ukrainian </F>
Supreme Council plenary session in Kiev on 1 June -- recorded] 
  [Text] Esteemed people's deputies, I am convinced that the 
Supreme Council is taking very important and proper steps by 
considering at its plenary sitting, for the second time in such 
a short space of time, the problems connected with Crimea. I am 
convinced that if the Supreme Council of the previous 
convocation had approached this issue in a similar way then we 
probably would not have had so many problems today. 
  Recent events that have taken place in the Republic of 
Crimea 
are causing serious anxiety and worry both in Ukraine and beyond 
it, and in Europe as well as in the world community. At issue 
is not only the safeguarding of Ukraine's territorial integrity 
but the preservation of peace and security, above all, on the 
European continent. The present situation which is unfolding in 
the Republic of Crimea requires a profound and detailed 
discussion by the Ukrainian Supreme Council, and I support the 
speeches made here today. They also demand that the Supreme 
Council adopt decisions appropriate to the situation. 
  As you know, on 10 May this year, the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine adopted a resolution on suspending the actions of the 
law of the Republic of Crimea on restoring the constitutional 
bases of Crimea's statehood. It was proposed that the Crimean 
Supreme Council should, within 10 days, bring the Crimean 
Constitution into line with the Constitution of Ukraine and the 
law of Ukraine on the division of powers between the bodies of 
state powers of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea. Ukraine's 
Supreme Council created a commission in order to hold talks with 
Crimea's Supreme Council on this issue. Talks were held between 
the delegations of both Supreme Councils, according to the 
results of which the delegations agreed to form a joint working 
group to elaborate the agreed proposals of Ukraine's Supreme 
Council and Crimea's Supreme Council. 
  In addition, according to the results of these talks, it was 
proposed that the Ukrainian and Crimean Supreme Councils should, 
within three days, discuss suspending the acts adopted on 20 May 
this year for the duration of the working group's activities. 
  The 10-day period has elapsed; however, Crimea's Supreme 
Council has not brought Crimea's Constitution into line with 
Ukraine's Constitution. Therefore, the power bodies of the 
Republic of Crimea are continuing the policy of ignoring the 
Ukrainian Constitution, our state's legislation, Supreme Council 
resolutions, and generally recognized principles and norms of 
international law. The question arises: Is this an accident or 
is it connected with the failure by the Crimean powers to 
understand the situation, or could it be a reflection of the 
strategic policy which the leadership of the Republic of Crimea 
is implementing? 
  Our assessment testifies to the fact that this is not an 
accident. The point is not in a good or a bad president but 
lies elsewhere. 
  A political force -- a party -- came to power in Crimea that 
proclaimed the secession of the Republic of Crimea from Ukraine 
and the return of the Republic of Crimea to Russia as its 
strategic course. This is the strategic course. This strategic 
course is divided into stages. The first stage is the adoption 
of a constitution that, in essence, would mean or would let 
everyone understand or draw the conclusion that Crimea is an 
independent state and that, as such, it can decide on its future 
on a contractual basis. In other words, it can decide on it in 
a constitutional way, so to say, proceeding, however, from the 
provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea only 
and ignoring the laws and the Constitution of Ukraine. 
  There is yet another way that is also being discussed. I 
would like us to discuss about this openly today. This way is 
the restoration of the former Soviet Union -- the fact of which 
is exactly the solution to all problems. In other words, all 
the problems would be removed because there would be no states. 
Their status would be changed. The problem of their 
territorial integrity, sovereignty and so on, would acquire 
quite a different nature, or -- let us say this openly -- states 
would cease to exist as such. These are the two ways as they 
are viewed in Crimea. 
  Why are they insisting on the first way? Because they are 
not convinced that it would be such a simple issue for Crimea to 
return to the Soviet Union and, speaking openly, it is not such 
a simple and realistic option within the composition of states 
of the former USSR. I stress: Any kind of explanations by the 
power structures of Crimea that they are acting in this way 
simply because Ukraine or its powers are so principled has 
absolutely no basis to it. This is meant for naive people. 
They say that if Kravchuk had not adopted these decrees on 
reconstituting the structures of the state security bodies -- 
the Internal Affairs Ministry -- then, they say, perhaps the 
Supreme Council of Crimea would not have adopted the law. Such 
an explanation is being proffered. Furthermore, they say that 
if President Kravchuk had not implemented the Supreme Council 
resolution -- incidentally the Supreme Council gave me a month 
to do this -- on creating a representation in Crimea, the 
situation would not have become so exacerbated. So, these are 
the explanations which some of them use to taunt us. 
  But this is not the point. I stress, the point is in the 
implementation of a strategic policy by a force that has come to 
power. These explanations are meant for the people and not as a 
serious policy. Please tell me why the Crimean authorities 
react so sharply to any Ukrainian -- I stress Ukrainian -- 
presence in Crimea? It is because they want to prove 
unambiguously to everybody that Crimea and Ukraine have nothing 
in common with each other. They say that there is something in 
the constitution which could be interpreted differently. Once 
again, however, this is meant for the people. They say to 
Ukraine: You want to satisfy your ambitions that Crimea is in 
the composition of Ukraine; then, de jure, we could write 
something which is ambiguous but de facto you are not there 
anymore: you are not present in the power bodies nor in relation 
to any specific issue. This is the reality, and it is being 
consistently implemented step by step in relation to the armed 
forces, dual citizenship, and citizenship. If you analyze all 
these problems then the result is unambiguous, and I came to 
this conclusion at the very beginning. 
  It is therefore clear today that we need to define our 
position in, as they say, an unambiguous way. Or we could, as 
some people are proposing, agree to anything just to maintain 
peace and quiet, and I am also in favor of this. But I am in 
favor of peace and quiet in relation to one thing only -- to 
place Crimea within the framework of the Constitution and laws. 
If we can do this -- and we are obliged to place Crimea within 
the framework of the constitution and laws -- then all other 
issues will be resolved. I repeat: All other issues will be 
resolved. There will be compromises, flexibility, and other 
things, and everything will be done by Ukraine's executive 
authorities and the Ukrainian president in order to find accord, 
cooperation, and mutual understanding. But if this basic and 
fundamental issue -- to the effect that Crimea is in the 
framework of Ukraine's constitution and laws -- is not finally 
resolved, then none of the other issues will be resolved. This 
is the founding principle and we should begin from this. 
  What is happening in Crimea today is, I repeat, a very 
dangerous precedent. We should give it a clear legal 
assessment. The leadership of the Supreme Council of Crimea 
ignores the fact that the Republic of Crimea is an autonomous 
and constituent part of Ukraine, with broad rights in the 
socioeconomic and cultural spheres, and in the sphere of 
organizing social life. At the same time, the Republic of 
Crimea, as an autonomous and constituent part of Ukraine, is not 
a bearer of state sovereignty and, in accordance with our 
constitution, cannot enter into political relations with foreign 
states. 
  The renewal of the principles within the Crimean 
constitution that the Republic of Crimea builds its relations 
with Ukraine on a contractual basis contravenes the autonomy's 
constitutional status. They often cite the fact that in the 
Russian Federation there are contractual relations between the 
Federation and subjects of the Federation, particularly in 
Tatarstan. If you familiarize yourself with this document which 
we have here and which could be given to you -- it is not a 
secret document, it has been published and so on -- yes, this is 
an agreement, but even in the agreement which they are citing, 
the authorities of the federal power are clearly defined: the 
Army, the internal affairs bodies, and the security bodies all 
belong to the authority of the federal power. In Crimea they 
want these areas to be completely within the competence of 
Crimea. This is nothing but a collapse of the entire defense 
system, a collapse of Ukraine's sovereignty as a state and those 
forces which should defend the inviolability of borders of the 
state's sovereignty and integrity. 
  What is being adopted by the Supreme Council and the 
president of Crimea is a practical transformation of autonomy 
into a bearer of state sovereignty and its secession from the 
composition of Ukraine, despite the slogans which may conceal 
this. In a legal sense it is necessary to stress that the 
constitution of Ukraine is valid throughout Ukraine, including 
the territory of the Republic of Crimea. The autonomy's 
constitution cannot contravene the constitution of Ukraine. The 
territory of Ukraine, which also includes the territory of 
Crimea, is single, indivisible, inviolable, and integral. Any 
changes to Ukraine's territory or state borders are not 
permitted without the agreement of the people of Ukraine. We 
all, both the executive and the legislative powers, should 
defend the integrity, inviolability, and indivisibility of our 
state. I hope that nobody has any doubt about this here. 
  In connection with the attempts to introduce its own 
citizenship within the Republic of Crimea, I stress: The 
Republic of Crimea does not have its own citizenship which is 
separate from Ukraine's. This is not envisaged anywhere. 
Incidentally, I do not know, but perhaps someone has 
information about world practice where, for example, part of a 
state has its own citizenship. [Word indistinct] legal 
assessment requires a decision by the leadership of the Republic 
of Crimea with regard to the subordination of Ukraine's security 
services, internal affairs bodies, and other armed formations. 
In accordance with the law of Ukraine on the division of powers 
between the bodies of state power of Ukraine and the Republic of 
Crimea, and other laws of Ukraine, these issues cannot be 
decided by the higher bodies of state power of the Republic of 
Crimea. They are decided solely by Ukraine. 
  Blatant violations of Ukraine's Consitution, of Ukraine's 
legislation, and of international legal norms are being carried 
out by the leadership of the Republic of Crimea, despite the 
fact that the higher bodies of state power of Ukraine, I stress, 
have created exceptionally broad possibilities for independently 
resolving the most important problems for the peninsula's 
population. It was the Supreme Council of Ukraine itself that 
gave the Crimean oblast the status of autonomy. Laws were 
adopted on the division of powers between the bodies of power of 
Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea. A year ago -- as long ago as 
June 1993 -- the president of Ukraine signed a decree on an open 
economic system for the territory of the Republic of Crimea. 
Following this decree -- and this is very important -- we gave 
the Republic of Crimea the possibility of acting within broad 
legal limits in the economic sphere, I stress within broad legal 
limits. The Republic of Crimea requested that the Ukrainian 
Government change the budgetary relations, and the Government 
fully accepted the proposals submitted by the Republic of 
Crimea. Therefore, today this issue has been taken off the 
agenda, in the sense that Crimea's budget has certain rights, 
although it is true that Crimea today does not fulfil its 
obligations in relation to Ukraine's budget, and does not pay 
what it should pay according to the norms and (?payments) of the 
budget's clauses. 
  Second, the president of Crimea issued a host of decrees on 
currency regulation and on taxation, which placed the Republic 
of Crimea in an appropriate regional condition. We knew that 
there were certain violations, but we did not demand that they 
should be repealed because we wanted to give the Crimea the 
chance to act autonomously in the economic sphere if the 
Crimeans themselves wanted this. I stress, there are no poblems 
today with regard to any restrictions in Crimea's economic 
sphere. Moreover, we see that this is leading to certain 
complications in economic relations, which has affected money 
and other issues from one region to another. 
  Now we are also thinking about how we can take certain steps 
on a Ukrainian-wide scale. I will tell you: I have instructed 
the Government to prepare a whole package of documents on 
changing the taxation system, which will be sent to the oblasts 
for analysis, and then passed to the Ukrainian Supreme Council 
for adoption. Concern is being caused by the fact that in order 
to carry out its economic and political strategy, the senior 
leadership of the Republic of Crimea is attracting, on a wide 
basis, specialists and personnel from Russia. I think there is 
even a certain contempt for local cadres, and there are such 
experts in Crimea who are experienced and who could take charge 
of the most important posts in the republic. However, the 
problem is set in such a way as to make it seem as though these 
cadres are not capable, and therefore one needs to attract 
personnel only from Russia. 
  I am not even talking about certain violations here with 
regard to the principle of Ukraine's law on citizenship. I 
granted Premier Yevhen Saburov Ukrainian citizenship, but this 
was an exception. I have the right to do this, but it is an 
exception. But what about the others? There are no exceptions. 
So once again, even here there are certain deviations from 
Ukrainian laws. This is the practical and legal aspect, but the 
moral and ethnic aspect of this lies in the fact that there is a 
direct contempt for cadres who were raised in Crimea. This is a 
direct contempt. 
  A number of resolutions on guaranteeing the socio-economic 
development of the peninsula were adopted by the Ukrainian 
Cabinet of Ministers. Among them are resolutions on the 
division of property in state ownership, general state 
ownership, and the property of the Republic of Crimea. 
Therefore, I conclude that all issues pertaining to the economy 
which the Republic of Crimea puts forward are being tackled by 
the president of Ukraine and the Ukrainian Government. Taking 
into account that, during the last month the leadership of the 
Republic of Crimea has adopted a number of acts that contravene 
the Ukrainian Constitution and Ukrainian legislation, the 
president of Ukraine, as guarantor of the Constitution, has 
repealed a number of decrees issued by the Crimean president. 
You are aware of these decrees. 
  Taking into account the considerable complexity of the crime 
situation in the Republic of Crimea and the growth in organized 
crime and serious crimes, a decree issued by the president of 
Ukraine reorganized the security service, the internal affairs 
and justice bodies, and the main directorates of the relevant 
bodies of Ukrainian state executive power in the Republic of 
Crimea. Taking into account all these steps by the executive 
authority, it must be noted that the situation that has arisen 
in the Republic of Crimea requires the adoption of appropriate 
acts by the Ukrainian Supreme Council. The situation whereby a 
legal uncertainty exists in relations between Ukraine and its 
autonomous part cannot remain indefinitely. We cannot permit a 
further exacerbation of the situation on the peninsula itself. 
Proceeding namely from these deliberations, I propose the 
following: 
  First, to ensure -- and what is more, I would like it do be 
done without delay -- the formation of a Constitutional Court of 
Ukraine. The decisions of the Supreme Council of Crimea which 
contradict Ukraine's Constitution and legislation must be 
abrogated by the Constitutional Court of Ukraine. 
  However, the following variant is also possible: when the 
Supreme Council itself abrogates the decisions by the Supreme 
Council of Crimea, but then amendments should be introduced to 
the Constitution. The Constitution does not envisage an 
abrogation. It was envisaged to stop the effect of these 
decisions by the Crimean parliament. Read carefully. So, we 
stop them. Then you have already stopped them -- but for how 
long? 
  I underscore that it should be clearly determined who is to 
abrogate. It is the Constitutional Court which abrogates. 
  On my part, I can submit candidatures for the Constitutional 
Court of Ukraine very soon. 
  Second, it is expedient to introduce amendments and 
additions 
to the Law of Ukraine on the delimitation of powers between the 
state power bodies of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea. This 
law must determine, in a more exact and specific manner, the 
competence of the autonomy, expand plenary powers -- however, 
within the limits of the recognition of the main principal 
postulate that Crimea is a constituent part of Ukraine. And it 
is necessary to take into account the changes which have already 
taken place. This is because the election of the president of 
Crimea requires the introduction of relevant legal changes to 
the law on the delimitation of powers between the state power 
bodies of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea. 
  By the way, it would be good for us to determine our stand 
in 
relation to actions by the Republic of Crimea concerning this 
law. You will remember, when the Supreme Council was adopting 
it, the following provision was entered into the resolution: 
that it comes into effect when the Republic of Crimea brings its 
constitution in line with the Constitution of Ukraine. But it 
has not been changed to date. Moreover, such amendments have 
been introduced which entirely ignore, or mainly ignore, the 
Constitution and laws of Ukraine. 
  Third, I believe the following must also be done: to 
introduce amendments and additions to the laws of Ukraine on the 
security service of Ukraine, and on the militia, which was 
adopted back in 1990, and other enactments which regulate the 
activities of so-called power-wielding structures within the 
Republic of Crimea. The situation there at present is not 
simple, as far as the power-wielding structures are concerned -- 
the militia first and foremost. 
  In the current conditions, in order to preserve peace and 
quiet on the peninsula, these structures within the Republic of 
Crimea must be subordinate solely to the center, as is the case 
in any state. We cannot and we have no right to allow the 
bodies called upon to ensure the protection of public order, the 
safety of the citizens and the state, to be turned into 
political organizations. Every power institution should exercise 
the powers established for it by law. 
  It is necessary to build budgetary relations between the 
Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers and the Crimean Government on a 
legal basis. We have made such a decision at a governmental 
level, but this must be regulated by law. 
  Next, with the aim of establishing contacts between the 
Supreme Council of Ukraine and the Supreme Council of Crimea, 
and more efficient parliamentary control over the situation in 
the Republic of Crimea, I would propose setting up a 
subcommission within one of the commissions that have already 
been set up at the Supreme Council. This subcommission would 
deal exclusively with Crimean issues at the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine. 
  One can agree to the proposal by individual people's 
deputies 
of Ukraine on inaugurating the post of a Ukrainian vice premier 
dealing with territorial issues, taking into account that not 
only Crimean problems exist, but that, first and foremost, 
territorial problems exist and will exist in the economic 
sphere, too. I believe this is of great importance. 
  Completion of the negotiating process with Russia on 
dividing the Black Sea Fleet is of principal importance for the 
settlement of the Crimean issue. Apart from proportions and the 
principles of division, this issue has two more aspects. 
  First, it is necessary to solve the issue of taking the two 
fleets to different bases and, second, to determine clearly and 
legally the status of the Russian fleet, which will be 
temporarily based on Ukraine's territory. To determine the 
status. 
  The solution of dividing the Black Sea Fleet will have a 
significant positive influence on developments in Crimea and 
will ease tensions in Ukrainian-Russian relations. The efforts 
of the Ukrainian delegation, led by Acting Premier Yukhym 
Leonidovych Zvyahilskyy, at the negotiations with Russian 
Premier Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin in Moscow on 23-25 May 
this year were targeted at achieving this very goal. 
  The stand of the Ukrainian side at these negotiations took 
into account the fact that, in the present-day conditions, 
Russia objectively has no real alternatives to basing its fleet 
on the Black Sea. It has no alternatives. We accept this. 
Ukraine is striving toward such a decision on the Black Sea 
Fleet issue which, as a whole, would correspond to our national 
interests and take into account in real terms Russia's needs to 
ensure its security in a southerly direction. However, it is 
clear that this issue will not be always be tackled in the same 
way. Russia must set up a base for its fleet on its own 
territory. This is how our delegation posed this question. 
  An agreement began to take shape on the fleet issues after 
the negotiations in Moscow on 23-25 May. This refers to such 
issues as the division of the floating means, on a principle, 
according to which, Ukraine takes the necessary number of ships; 
compensation for that part of the ships which Ukraine does not 
need today, and for the use of certain Ukrainian territories by 
Russia for the temporary basing of its fleet; determining the 
conditions of granting part of the shore-based infrastructure of 
Crimea to Russia on lease to ensure the needs of its fleet; and 
the division of the coastal defense forces, marine infantry, and 
land-based naval aviation which is part of the Black Sea Fleet. 
Among these issues is the determining of the order of settling 
accounts for the ships and vessels which had been written off by 
the Black Sea Fleet during the period after 3 August 1992. 
  An agreement was reached at the negotiations to continue the 
talks within the next two weeks on those issues which have not 
been settled. 
  Therefore, esteemed people's deputies, the regulation of the 
Crimean problem is of vital important for Ukraine, first and 
foremost for the Republic of Crimea itself. This is an issue of 
great politics today, and it concerns not only Ukraine. It is 
today a problem on a European, even a world scale. Today we are 
suffering both political and economic losses, and have not yet 
found a wise solution to the Crimean problem for the sake of 
peace on the continent, and for the sake of establishing 
friendly and partnership relations with our neighbors. 
  If we do not solve this problem as the future demands, then 
the consequences will be even more dangerous. In my opinion, 
the way to resolve this problem is through strict adherence to 
the constitutional regime, both by the power structures of 
Ukraine and correspondingly by the structures of the Republic of 
Crimea. In setting out my views and conclusions, I am counting 
on the Supreme Council supporting the submitted proposals. 
Thank you for your attention.

  [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk met chiefs of 
the leading Russian mass media, members of the Moscow club of 
editors-in-chief, in Kiev on 2 June. A broad range of issues 
was addressed, particularly those connected with Crimea and the 
Black Sea Fleet. The following was underlined: Complete 
alienation of Crimea from Ukraine is absurd because Crimea is 
inseparable from and depends upon Ukraine. Of course, there are 
issues that need to be solved jointly. One of these is dividing 
the Black Sea Fleet and determining the basing sites for the 
Russian Black Sea Fleet and Ukraine's Naval Forces. However, at 
this point one should display tolerance, common sense and mutual 
respect. 
  The media chiefs asked the president of Ukraine: Is there 
any 
confidence that the use of force in Crimea can be avoided? 
  Leonid Kravchuk answered: Under no circumstances will we 
resort to the use of force, and we call on the leadership of 
Crimea to abide by the same principle. 
  The issue of a possible federal land structure of Ukraine 
was 
raised during the conversation. The president's reply was quite 
clear-cut: One cannot just hold forth on it. It cannot be 
considered at a domestic, unprofessional level. 
  The leaders of the Russian mass media were also concerned 
about the Ukrainian president's attitude toward the work done in 
Ukraine by the journalists of other states. Leonid Kravchuk 
agreed to the proposal to discuss a common information space at 
the level of the CIS heads and declared his readiness to 
initiate the adoption of a relevant document. 
  They also asked the president of Ukraine about his personal 
goals and desires. The Moscow journalists heard the following 
reply: I would like progress to begin in the economic sphere in 
Ukraine, and to see friendly relations take shape between 
neighbors not formally but in practical terms, in particular, 
between Russia and Ukraine, because there is no alternative 
here. I would like Russians to regard Ukraine as an equal 
partner. 
  Dwelling on mutual relations with the Supreme Council and 
its 
chairman, the president of Ukraine pointed out that they are 
businesslike and that relations with Oleksandr Moroz are normal. 
  As for the upcoming presidential election, Leonid Kravchuk 
said: The election will take place. The main struggle, in my 
opinion, will get under way during the second round. Who will 
enter it? I believe it will be Leonid Kuchma. I am almost 
convinced of this. Who else? Possibly myself. 
  At the end of the conversation the president of Ukraine 
again 
turned to the issue of mutual relations between Ukraine and 
Russia. He underlined that these relations should be built while 
taking into account the fact that the two states should live in 
peace and accord.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovsky; edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin; all quotation marks as received] 
  [Text] Ukraine's Supreme Soviet has not given its backing 
to the proposals of several radical politicians to introduce 
direct presidential ruling in Crimea. In accordance with the 
resolution adopted by the parliament on Wednesday evening, early 
next week President Leonid Kravchuk is to submit a list of 
measures which can be used by Ukraine's state bodies in case the 
Crimean law-makers refuse to abolish legal acts which contradict 
to the Ukrainian Constitution. 
  The Ukrainian parliamentarians also reconfirmed that their 
resolution dated 20 May which suspends the decree of the 
Republic of Crimea on the restoration of the Crimean 
Constitution dated 6 May 1992 is still in force (This decree 
stipulates that the relations between Simferopol and Kiev are to 
be built on the basis of agreements; it fixes the right of the 
Crimean residents for dual citizenship and for the creation of 
their own armed formations -- INTERFAX). 
  The parliament has set up the commission on legal policy to 
work out its proposals on introduction of changes into Ukraine's 
legislation, which admit "direct abolition of the legal acts of 
Crimea's Supreme Soviet," within two weeks." IF Note: Kravchuk 
offered to the parliament to form Ukraine's Constitutional court 
as soon as possible which will be authorized to abolish all 
"illegal" decisions of the power bodies of the Republic of 
Crimea. Kravchuk explained the need of its creation by the 
restriction of authorities of the Supreme Soviet which, as 
Kravchuk said, "can only suspend but not abolish illegal acts of 
this autonomy." 
  Commenting on the resolution adopted by the Ukrainian 
deputies, observers point out that it testifies to the adherence 
of the absolute majority of the parliamentarians to political 
methods to solve the Crimean problems. To this effect experts 
point to a small probability of a sharp worsening of relations 
between Kiev and Simferopol before the 26 June presidential 
elections. 
  According to the leader of the parliamentary delegation at 
the negotiations with the Republic of Crimea Vladimir Butkevich, 
"the Ukrainian party must do its utmost it order to halt the 
negative processes in Crimea." "We must do our utmost in order 
to accomplish this diplomatically without utilization of force." 
  At the same time observers indicate that the parliament 
majority did not support the initiative of the pro-Russian 
oriented parliamentary group Yedinstvo (Unity) which had 
proposed to ensure the equality of the Ukrainian and Russian 
languages in a legal way and to consider a possibility of 
Ukraine's transformation into a federation. It also failed to 
take into consideration the proposal of the leader of the 
inter-regional deputies group Leonid Kuchma to grant "a special 
status" to Crimea. 
  While forecasting further development of events, experts 
draw 
attention to the recent statements and restrained position of 
Ukraine's Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy who declared that 
Ukraine's Defense Ministry has not sent a single soldier to 
Crimea over the last period of time." 
  Meanwhile, circles close to Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov 
do not rule out possibility that Kravchuk's team can use a tough 
scenario. As the leader of the presidential apparatus and the 
Crimean government Viktor Minin asserts, "Kiev maintains a 
99-percent readiness to introduce presidential ruling in 
Crimea." In his interview with INTERFAX Minin declared that the 
situation on the peninsular "is used for a struggle at the 
highest political level" in Kiev (in this case Meshkov's 
spokesman means the wide spread version about Kravchuk's strive 
to take advantage of the tension around Crimea in order to 
postpone the presidential elections." 
  As Minin predicts, introduction of a direct ruling in Crimea 
may lead to a tough confrontation between Russia and Ukraine. 
"Russia will be forced either "to wash itself" or "to react," he 
noted and in case President Yeltsin does not undertake any moves 
then "Mr Zhirinovsky (leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia -- INTERFAX) and Russian servicemen will urge either 
tough measures from this power or replacement of power."

  [Text] Moscow June 3 TASS -- "Ukraine plans to supply space 
exploration accessories to the Baykonur space launching grounds 
on condition of a Ukrainian possibility to use the grounds," 
First Deputy General Director of the Ukrainian National Space 
Agency Andrey Zhalko-Titarenko told a news conference on results 
of a meeting of the Inter-State Space Council here today. 
  The meeting discussed a new program of joint space 
exploration for Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Uzbekistan, 
Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. The program will be 
finalized and submitted to the council of state heads, said 
General Director of the Russian Space Agency Yuriy Koptev. 
  The meeting participants reported priority research areas of 
their national space agencies. For instance, Ukraine plans to 
develop rocket-building and finalize the Zenit Ukraine rocket- 
booster. 
  In the words of General Director of the Kazakh Space Agency 
Aisultan Kalybayev, Kazakhstan will participate in seven out of 
the 12 program items, including telecommunications and 
communications means. As for Baykonur, he said that "the 
grounds are Kazakh property and the republic cannot keep aside 
from its activities." Documents on conditions of the Baykonur 
rent have not been discussed, said Yuriy Koptev.

  [Text] The Interstate Council for Space, which incorporates 
the countries of the former USSR, accepted the program on 
cooperation in space research and use for 1994 when it met in 
Moscow from June 2-3. 
  The meeting was attended by representatives of Russia, 
Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Belarus, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and 
Georgia, which was admitted to the Council at the current 
session. 
  The cooperation program involves joint efforts in 12 areas 
of 
space activity, including space communications, remote earth 
exploration, manned flights, new scientific space systems and 
the creation of new rocket-launch vehicles. 
  The program's overall cost is estimated at 1.2 trillion 
rubles (in January 1994 prices), the "minimum sum", to quote 
Russian Space Agency officials, needed to carry the program out. 
  Each party to the program will decide how to finance the 
program on an individual basis, taking their government's real 
contribution into account. The countries also agreed to become 
involved in financing vital facilities, such as the Baykonur 
(Kazakhstan) and Plesetsk (North Russia) launch sites. 
  The program must be submitted to the Intergovernmental CIS 
Council for consideration.

  [Text] The CIS Executive Secretary, Ivan Korotchenya, has 
told Interfax that a majority of CIS countries gave support to 
President Yeltsin's call for deploying collective peace-keeping 
forces in the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict area. Now they are 
awaiting Moscow's political decision on this matter. According 
to Korotchenya, he came to Moscow to inform the Russian 
president of the results of his recent mission during which he 
consulted the leaders of CIS countries in connection with the 
initiative of Boris Yeltsin, who is the chairman of the Council 
of the Heads of Commonwealth States. 
  As Korotchenya said, all CIS leaders "see the need to deploy 
peace-keeping forces in the conflict area, and many undertook to 
despatch observers there and give as much material aid as they 
can." Some CIS countries "may deploy their peace-keeping 
contingents in the conflict zone after the necessary 
consultations," Korotchenya added. 
  As regards the CIS countries which joined the Council of 
Collective Security, Minsk alone has not taken its final 
decision on Yeltsin's appeal. It will determine its stand, when 
the parliament convenes for a session after June 23. Moldova, 
Ukraine and Turkmenistan, which did not sign the Treaty on 
Collective Security, have not reacted to the Russian president's 
call so far. 
  With reference to the Federation Council's failure to 
approve 
the deployment of Russian peace-keepers in the conflict area, 
Korotchenya said he hopes that the upper chamber of Russia's 
parliament will resolve this issue positively when it 
reconsiders it. 
  The deployment of peace-keepers requires the approval of 
Russia's president, who promised in his appeal that Russian 
servicemen will form the backbone of collective forces, 
Korotchenya said. "As far as I know, the military are ready to 
all intents and purposes; they are waiting for a political 
decision. Abkhazia, Georgia and the Caucasus as a whole are 
also waiting for it," said the CIS executive secretary. 
  According to Korotchenya, the deployment of peace-keepers in 
the conflict zone is designed to indicate that the CIS is 
capable of resolving its internal problems on its own, without 
the participation of the U.N., the CSCE, or other international 
organizations.

  [Text] Baku (June 6) (TURAN) -- From the talks between 
Azeri President Geydar Aliyev and Ivan Karatchenya [CIS 
Executive Secretary] it become evident that Russian troops under 
status of CIS peacemaking forces could be deployed in the 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone. 
  Karatchenya visited the Central Asia states and Georgia. 
He visited these states with the intent to put into effect a 
request by Eduard Shevardnadze, President of Georgia about the 
deployment of joint CIS forces in Georgian-Abkhazian conflict 
zone and about the appeal by Boris Yeltsin to CIS members. 
  The decision regarding the troop deployment might be adopted 
as early as Friday, after Karatchenya briefs Yeltsin on the 
results of his visit to the two regions. Karatchenya told the 
Azeri President that although Central Asia supports the 
peacemaking forces, questions do remain. 
  In this respect Karatchenya said that Azerbaijan's position 
has particular significance. 
  He admitted that the CIS forces will consist only of Russian 
troops. According to Aliyev, this situation arises serious 
questions. "We speak about the CIS as forces cooperating as a 
commonwealth. And now it has become evident that talk is only 
about Russian troops. I think that international authority of 
the CIS as a Commonwealth of members with equal rights will 
suffer from this arrangement," said Aliyev. 
  The confidentiality of the talks is testimony to the fact 
that Speaker Rasul Guliyev, Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov, 
State Secretary for International Affairs Vafa Guluzade, and 
Vice-Premier Abbas Abbasov waited for the closed-door 
discussions to come to an end. During the short recess, TURAN 
was able to speak with Karatchenya who said that "Azerbaijan's 
leadership sees the deployment of CIS peacemaking forces into 
Georgia as necessary, but with the active participation of the 
United Nations and the CSCE. The Azeris think it is necessary to 
increase the contingent of UN observers to equal that of the 
CIS. I do not exclude the fact that the Azeri President will 
adopt the decision to send an Azeri military subdivision as part 
of the CIS peacemaking forces to Abkhazia, since these must be 
joined." He further said that discussion is about a 400-soldier 
batallion. 
  It is expected that CIS forces totalling 2500 to 3000 people 
will be deployed to Georgia. The UN will finance the bulk of 
the expenses. 
  The operation for the CIS force deployment to Georgia is 
scheduled to [sentence as received; passage apparently dropped 
in transmission] Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone can be 
applied, in part, be applied to the Karabakh situation. He also 
noted that the Karabakh conflict was not discussed during the 
talks. 
  A senior Presidential staff member expressed his doubts that 
Baku will seriously send a batallion of its soldiers to Georgia. 
At the same time, he noted that this operation is of practical 
interest to Azerbaijan and help Baku to correct its approaches 
to the options for the settlement of the Karabakh conflict.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 4 (ITAR-TASS) -- All today's Russian 
newspapers print materials on the 195th birth of the great 
Russian writer Aleksandr Sergeyevich Pushkin to be marked on 
June 6. The Russian press also singles out the celebration of 
the 50th anniversary of the D-Day, the opening of the second 
front in Europe in the Second World War. 
  In this connection, the ROSSIYSKIYE GAZETA newspaper notes 
that Russia was not invited to celebrate the D-Day jubilee. "It 
is understandable why Russia was not invited," the newspaper 
writes. 
  "It is inconvenient for some people to stand next to those 
who made the main contribution to the victory over Nazi Germany 
and to boast of their combat feats in, let it be, the largest 
landing operation of the Second World War and yet an operation 
but not the decisive battle of the war." 
  Writing on the same topic, the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper 
stresses: "An operation, unique in its scale and organisation, 
is a property of both military history and mankind's experience, 
experience of self-sacrifice in the name of victory over evil 
and an example of unity of people of various nationalities in 
the name of a common goal, about which some people forget these 
days." 
  At the same time, the newspaper notes that, "according to 
public opinion polls conducted in France and the United States, 
the world started forgetting who made the main contribution to 
the victory over Nazism. 
  "Some 20 per cent of respondents, on average, remember the 
Soviet Union. Most speak about the American victory. The 
French mention even Italy." 
  The ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI newspaper runs a front-page article, 
criticising the Finance Ministry headed by Sergey Dubinin. "The 
present-day Finance Ministry resembles a torpedoed ship which is 
still afloat and moves by inertia but already loses speed," the 
newspaper notes. 
  The same newspaper carries an article devoted to Aleksandr 
Solzhenitsyn's return home. The newspaper writes in its 
commentary that people, beset by political passions, complain 
that Solzhenitsyn came to teach them how to live. 
  "We ourselves make a lord out of him who will decide who is 
right and who is wrong," the newspaper says. "Solzhenitsyn who 
was not broken by gulag and a forced expulsion from the country, 
will not be anybody's confidant." 
  The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper features an interview 
with 
Russian Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov who opposes the 
salvaging of the sunken nuclear-powered Komsomolets submarine. 
  Mikhailov, the designer of nuclear weapons of the third 
generation, says: "There is no need to surface the submarine. 
All examinations show that there is no leakage of plutonium". 
  He claims that the submarine should be left at the sea 
bottom. It will sink into ooze, and nature will take care of 
neutralising the sub's nuclear weapons better than people. 
  The PRAVDA newspaper carries an interview with Professor 
Aleksandr Livshits, head of the Russian president's expert group. 
  According to Livshits, "provided there is clear course of 
the 
present government and no political confrontation, there is no 
more than one year left to the initial stages of an economic 
rebound in Russia". 
  The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIA newspaper front-pages an interview 
with 
former State Security Minister Viktor Barannikov. 
  He explains his removal from the ministerial post by the 
fact 
that "it was not to the liking of the president's team, above 
all, an insistent demand and readiness to take urgent and 
specific measures at the state level against an appalling 
pillage of the country's wealth. 
  "They were incensed by facts (quoted in my reports) of 
direct 
complicity in this of high-ranking government officials as well 
as by glaring facts of corruption at the top echelons." 
  Commenting on the talks on the division of the Black Sea 
Fleet, the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper writes: "It is in vain to 
hope for an early division of the Black Sea Fleet. The delay is 
advantageous for Ukraine, since Russia, in fact, maintains the 
entire fleet all alone, hence its Ukrainian part. 
  "Besides," the newspaper continues, "some politicians are in 
no hurry to close the question on the Black Sea Fleet, since 
they `have not squeezed' as yet all political `dividends' out of 
this issue."

  [Text] Russia's Agrarian Party fails to see Aleksandr 
Rutskoy as the united left's candidate in the upcoming 
presidential race. 
  The party's leader Mikhail Lapshin would not place his bet 
on 
Rutskoy even though Rutskoy was in charge of the land reform 
and, more than any other member of the Yeltsin Administration, 
took to heart the needs and concerns of rural Russia. 
  Lapshin told Interfax the party's Council was yet to decide 
who deserved the Agrarians' backing. 
  According to Lapshin, both Rutskoy and his Social-Democratic 
party had to travel a long way before emerging as the leading 
opposition force. Instead of searching for a presidential 
candidate, Lapshin said, the opposition had better bring 
together forces and launch a wide propagandistic and educational 
campaign. The opposition leader, according to Lapshin, would 
appear when his time came.

  [Text] Kursk June 3 TASS -- Former Vice-President Aleksandr 
Rutskoy arrived in the Kursk region. Kursk residents learned 
about his arrival beforehand. Local reports said that Rutskoy 
intends to visit Kursk to see his mother who will be celebrating 
her birthday. 
  However, Rutskoy is not the kind of a man to restrict his 
visit by ties of kinship only. The first thing he did upon 
arrival was to meet workers of the "Khimvolokno" joint stock 
society, which was followed by a series of other meetings, 
prompting his political opponents to declare that Rutskoy has 
begun his "election marathon". 
  Talking to his fellow countrymen, Rutskoy declared that he 
had not betrayed the president. "I have been and continue to 
defend the interests of the people who were driven to poverty." 
he said. 
  In Rutskoy's opinion, the Constitution, parliament and power 
in the country are invalid, since no one repealed a decision of 
the Constitutional Court, a law on a referendum and a law on 
elections and a resolution adopted by the Congress of Russian 
People's Deputies. 
  When asked about the former socialist system in the Soviet 
Union, Rutskoy said directly that "what was called socialism in 
this country was not socialism at all. We must cast aside all 
`ism' suffixes and look for another way," he said. 
  Rutskoy unveiled his plans which were already outlined in 
appeals circulated before the beginning of his meetings with the 
people. He said that at first, it is necessary to unite all 
social-patriotic forces of the "Derzhava" movement in order to 
be well-prepared for the forthcoming presidential elections and 
etc. 
  In conclusion, Rutskoy promised to create civilized society 
and guarantee life worthy of every citizen if the Derzhava 
movement won the forthcoming elections. However, Rutskoy never 
mentioned that he intends to run for the presidency.

of Accord for Russia Movement in Moscow 28 May, incorporating 
accounts of speeches by State Duma Deputy Sergey Glazyev, 
Federal Assembly Deputy Petr Romanov, Social Democratic People's 
Party Chairman Aleksandr Rutskoy, and Communist Party of the 
Russian Federation leader Gennadiy Zyuganov, under the general 
heading "Russia Should Once Again Believe in Itself: Broad 
Patriotic Movement's National Council Has Taken Place in Moscow. 
The Fatherland. Morality. Professionalism"] 
  [Text] Aleksandr Rutskoy, former Russian vice president, 
chairman of the Social Democratic People's Party, and hero of 
the Soviet Union: 
<H5>  "New Russians" Are West's Fifth Column </H5>
  Before it is too late we must explain to people and make the 
masses conscious of the fact that as a result of the bloody 
slaughter in Moscow and the dissolution and bombardment of the 
supreme constitutional organs of power, an antipeople 
police regime has been established in the country, whose basic 
levers of control are force and disinformation. We have an 
obligation to explain unambiguously to society what we can 
expect in the future from the antipeople regime which has taken 
under its wing a tyrannical clan of power-seekers, unprincipled 
political posers, and skilled adventurists who are selling 
Russia lock, stock, and barrel.... The class of so-called "new 
Russians," comprising representatives of the most well-off 
strata of society who have managed to grow fantastically rich by 
plundering the country and redistributing material wealth and 
resources, has formed and established itself.... The "new 
Russians" are those mafia clans which are ruling the country, 
the corrupt bureaucrats who serve their political, ideological, 
and social interests, the section of the intelligentsia which 
has sold out to the the regime, and the criminal world.... 
We have every right to claim that the regime which has become 
established in the country is serving the interests of Western 
powers, international financial circles, and their fifth column 
in Russia -- the "new Russians".... Even the destruction of the 
country's industrial potential caused by the bloody war with 
fascist Germany cannot be compared to the damage which the 
enthusiastic reformers have inflicted at the behest of their 
Western sponsors. According to many indicators, the level of 
the country's economy and the population's standard of living 
has fallen twice as much as during the four years of the war.... 
If such a policy is continued, Russia may in the very near 
future come up against mass unemployment for the first time in 
75 years, which in some regions may affect up to 30 percent of 
the working population. In such circumstances a social 
explosion will become inevitable.... 
  Today you cannot help but broach the subject expressed by 
the 
slogan: "Let's live in harmony." Suffering from an 
ill-concealed inferiority complex after the coup d'etat and the 
failure of December's electoral farce, the regime decided to pin 
the blame on everybody and cover their wound with the fig leaf 
of the "Social Accord Treaty." This would have been funny had 
it not been so sad. Because for a head of state to sign a 
treaty with heads of administration and a government whom he 
himself had appointed and to attempt to negotiate an agreement 
with social and political organizations on a series of 
self-evident issues, which are incidentally regulated by law, is 
no more than a display, a farce, whose tragic finale is known in 
advance. But the treaty appeared. Everybody has now finally 
seen who is who. The alignment of socio-political forces has 
become precise and clear. Those supporting the antipeople police 
regime lifted the veil themselves and shattered the various 
myths surrounding left-wingers, right-wingers, and centrists 
supposedly representing the opposition. Now everything has 
fallen into place, now even a political novice can grasp who is 
on whose side and who is against whom or what. Fortunately, the 
myth about "centrism," which confused the public consciousness, 
has also been shattered. Today everyone has begun to understand 
that Russia lacks a social base for refined centrist policies, 
since its basis -- the middle class -- does not exist. What 
kind of pure "centrism" can we be talking about when during 
three years of "reforms" the most fundamental social and 
property-based stratification of the people has taken place? 
What kind of centrism can there be when 3 percent of people in 
the country are rich, 7 percent are moderately well-off, 50 
percent are poor, and 40 percent are destitute? 
  Today there is a struggle in progress between two 
parties: the party of national betrayal which is in power, and 
the national opposition party which is defending the people's 
and the state's interests, and comprises both left-wingers 
and right-wingers, who are nevertheless united about one thing 
-- love for their Homeland and serving their people 
patriotically. 
  ...It is necessary to state in a precise and clear manner 
the 
movement's strategic aim which is as follows and cannot be 
otherwise: to come to power and implement a series of measures 
to restore order, revive the economy, and reestablish the 
country's unity within the borders of the Soviet Union. The 
route to achieving this is based on victory in the elections. 
Therefore, we should unambiguously state that we demand that 
early elections of the Russian Federation president should be 
held.... A government in opposition should be formed and 
proclaimed at the assembly, and candidacies for all positions in 
the state administration nominated right down to regional level. 
  In conclusion I would like to point out that if we form a 
line, a scrimmage, in the struggle for power, we can only expect 
defeat. We should act as a united front, forget all squabbles, 
rows, disputes, and insults. We do not have all that much time 
left. It is time to put a stop to unprincipled behavior, 
spinelessness, and compromise. Either we, having once 
genuinely united, resolve the issue of power and save the 
country, or we will be crushed by the approaching colonial 
democracy and orgy of crime, and the next of the regime's 
proteges will get into office under the cover of the political 
hullabaloo. 
  Gennadiy Zyuganov, deputy of the State Duma and leader of 
the 
Communist Party of the Russian Federation: 
<H5>  Repeal the Criminal Belovezhskaya Deal! </H5>
  What does the present state power actually represent? It is 
the power of a parasitic minority over the vast majority of the 
people. The dominion of a handful of people, linked by a 
network of mutual support and rich from plundering public 
property, is becoming more and more firmly established in 
Russia. As plunder and thieving on a wide scale have become 
possible with the permission and encouragement of the present 
authorities, they themselves are becoming criminal and are 
turning corruption into an ordinary everyday phenomenon. The 
support of Western capital is turning the Russian authorities 
into an exclusively comprador, antipeople force.... 
  The second Russian conference of the Communist Party of the 
Russian Federation, which took place in April of this year, came 
to the conclusion that this regime has no constitutional and 
legal basis whatsoever, and is one of the main sources of civil 
confrontation and a serious obstacle on the path to social 
accord. The conference drew up a series of general democratic 
measures in the area of politics aimed at overcoming the present 
situation by peaceful means, and I think that the "Accord for 
Russia" movement could use these proposals of ours as a basis. 
  The preparation of proposals for the creation of a 
government 
of national confidence is the most important part of our work 
and should be commenced immediately. The names of the 
candidates for such a government should be published and its 
members' work should be organized with a view to studying the 
situation in the appropriate areas of public life, with 
appearances in the press and on television. A detailed program 
should be produced and highly professional managers selected. 
On the basis of the election results, such a shadow government 
could be transformed into an actual government of national 
confidence.... 
  Preparations for a presidential election should run 
alongside 
those for the general elections. Here "Accord for Russia" 
should clearly direct its attention to forming a kind of state 
council of its most authoritative leaders. In the event of a 
presidential election being called, it would be possible to 
nominate one or two agreed candidacies from among them, which 
need not be advertised before the election is announced. 
Opposition candidates for the post of president could make a 
general statement to the effect that the presidency as a state 
institution contradicts Russia's historical practice and 
traditions. One of the new president's first actions should be 
to make an amendment to the Constitution abolishing the 
institution of the presidency and restoring genuine people's 
power in the form of the unified system of soviets of people's 
deputies.... 
  The struggle to recreate a renewed Union of the Soviet 
peoples on a voluntary basis will be an inseparable part of the 
"Accord for Russia" organizations' activities. The most 
important action here would be for the parliaments of all states 
formed on the USSR's territory to denounce the Belovezhskaya 
agreements. The first public step in this direction could be 
the adoption by the second congress of USSR peoples of the 
general idea of resurrecting the Union, and the holding of a 
meeting in Belovezhskaya Forest in December 1994 involving 
representatives of all the Soviet republics' patriotic forces, 
who will declare in the name of their peoples that the criminal 
agreement between the three presidents has been repealed.

  [Text] We have a fragment of an interview between our Kursk 
correspondent Natalya Zhurba and Aleksandr Rutskoy: 
  [Begin recording] [Rutskoy] People want to know the truth 
because the media lie and distort everything I say and the 
positions that I defend. We shall see who was right, history 
will judge us. As long as Yeltsin is president there will be no 
positive changes in the country. Because this is all his fault 
- the destruction of that great power, the Soviet Union, and the 
destruction of the country's economy. All this is his doing -- 
the poverty, refugees, local conflicts, bloodshed. 
  [Zhurba] But at that time you were there by his side. 
  [Rutskoy] I was with him for six months only. After he 
signed the CIS treaty we were no longer together. I stated my 
position on this clearly and defended it until the Supreme 
Soviet was gunned down. And I am still defending my positions 
and will never change them. 
  [Zhurba] Do you see yourself as a leader who, on becoming 
president, could change the course and the policy of the state 
and make our state richer and people's living standards better? 
  [Rutskoy] It is the people who should judge me, Yeltsin and 
others. The people should choose their leader. [end recording] 
  Nevertheless, the last word will be said by those who do not 
just listen to Aleksandr Rutskoy, but sometimes see him on the 
television screen calling on all the healthy, strong men and 
urging them to storm this building or that building.

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS commentator Tamara Zamyatina article for </F>
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA: "Russia-Tatarstan Treaty: Key to Political 
Stabilization"] 
  [Text] The Russian president's two-day trip to Tatarstan 
confirmed that both the center and the components of the 
Federation have become convinced that the country's people can 
only live a humane life within an integral state. Otherwise the 
alternative is civil and political confrontation, unresolved 
socioeconomic problems, and hence national enmity. Conflicts 
and impoverishment, which are well known from the bitter 
examples of Chechnya, Karabakh, and Abkhazia. 
  Farsighted politicians such as Tatarstan's president, 
Mintimer Shaymiyev, have also realized that talk of separatism 
and national independence helped them to come to power but not 
to remain at the helm, since you cannot feed the people or boost 
the economy on political ambition. 
  It is customary to think that the bilateral treaty between 
Russia and Tatarstan concluded 15 February this year has brought 
stability to life in Tatarstan. However, I think that the 
treaty was the consequence of conscious necessity and not a 
panacea for separatism. 
  The economy of Tatarstan, as you know, rests on three basic 
things -- automobile building, military-industrial complex 
enterprises, and the agrarian sector. It was not only First 
Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets but also the Tatarstan leadership 
who stressed during Boris Yeltsin's trip that without Russian 
Government aid the republic would not have managed to refurbish 
the KamAZ plant, particularly after last year's fire in the 
engine plant. 
  And the subsequent development of the automobile giant would 
have been in jeopardy without the 47 billion rubles [R] in 
credit given to KamAZ on the eve of the Russian president's 
arrival, without the enterprise's being exempted from profits 
and value-added tax until the end of the year, and without 
Russian Government guarantees in return for which the Japanese, 
inter alia, are giving KamAZ $400 million in credit. 
  Need one say that the military-industrial complex plants 
undergoing conversion in Tatarstan would have long since closed 
down without financial injections from the federal budget. 
  As for the agrarian sector, according to Fatikh 
Sibagatullin, 
the republic's agriculture minister, since the beginning of the 
year alone, R80 billion have been paid out of state coffers to 
meet the sector's requirements, and in June Vice Premier 
Aleksandr Zaveryukha promised another R35 billion. During a 
conversation with your ITAR-TASS commentator, Tatarstan 
President Mintimer Shaymiyev also acknowledged that the 
republic's agro-industrial complex cannot develop without budget 
subsidies. 
  However, Mintimer Shaymiyev in his mild oriental manner 
persuaded Boris Yeltsin of the advisability of an "experiment," 
which boils down to Tatarstan implementing "reforms with a human 
face." Thus, low food prices are being retained in Tatarstan, 
and privatization is proceeding at a far more restrained pace 
than in other regions. 
  At the same time Tatarstan is paying 5-6 percent of the 20 
percent in taxes to the state treasury stipulated in the 
bilateral treaty, Vadim Pechenev, deputy head of the Russian 
President's Staff Administration for Work with the Territories, 
and Emil Pain, an expert in the head of state's staff, 
calculated. As a result, since the beginning of the year alone 
Tatarstan's debts to Russia have amounted to R43 billion (a 
figure cited by Boris Yeltsin in an interview with an ITAR-TASS 
commentator), while the total is around R2 trillion. 
  In order not to hurt the Tatarstan leader's feelings too 
much, the Russian president told journalists that the republic's 
debts are the result of the universal problem of payment 
defaults and Mintimer Shaymiyev has himself promised to pay off 
the debts as soon as a financial solution emerges. 
  But, needless to say, these were just statements for the 
press, and behind clsed doors the Tatar side won Boris Yeltsin's 
support for the funding of a bridge across the Kama and for the 
restoration of the Kazan Kremlin. There was also a request for 
money for the modernization of the airport in the republic's 
capital. "There are always requests for money despite the 
desire for independence," one high-ranking representative of the 
Russian delegation commented on the state of affairs. 
  And Mintimer Shaymiyev was indeed far less keen to discuss 
with Boris Yeltsin the question of bringing Tatarstan's 
constitution into line with the new Russian Constitution. The 
point is that the republic is claiming an autonomous role as a 
subject of international relations. What is more, under its 
laws soldiers only perform their compulsory military service on 
Tatarstan's territory. All that is clearly at variance with the 
principles of a federal state. 
  Thus, the bilateral treaty between Russia and Tatarstan on 
the demarcation of areas of jurisdiction has today made it 
possible to resolve the main problem -- the problem of political 
stabilization. "Tatarstan has been transformed from a region 
that was almost used to scare children into one of the calmest 
republics for people of different nationalities," Emil Pain 
said. Thus, in his view, a weight has been taken off the minds 
of both the almost 4 million Tatars living outside the republic 
and the Russians in Tatarstan who make up half the republic's 
population. 
  However, Boris Yeltsin summed up the results of his trip by 
warning that the treaty should not become just a political 
declaration, just a "piece of paper." Concrete efforts are 
needed to implement it on both sides, which was why a bilateral 
commission, led on the Russian side by First Vice Premier Oleg 
Soskovets and on the Tatarstan side by the republic's prime 
minister, Mukhammat Sabirov, was formed. 
  The commission is to work out a mechanism for the operation 
of the treaty which presupposes the implementation of a whole 
series of federal programs and economic agreements. 
Subsequently the format of Russian-Tatarstan bilateral 
relations may be used to conclude similar treaties with other 
republics, krays, and oblasts in the Federation. 
  Nevertheless, the center's first experience of settling 
relations with Tatarstan can rightly be described as the "golden 
key" that opens the doors to constructive ethnic and regional 
policy and the creation of a strong state capable of protecting 
citizens' interests.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vice Premier Sergey Shakhray by Yevgeniy </F>
Molchanov in the "Power" column: "The Question of Resignation 
Is Closed. Sergey Shakhray Will Participate in Negotiations 
With Chechnya" -- place, date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Molchanov] Sergey Mikhaylovich, what is the 
real story behind your resignation? 
  [Shakhray] It is known that my resignation was preceded by 
my dismissal from the post of nationalities and regional policy 
minister which, in my opinion, was effected in violation of 
ethical norms. I had two options: either to keep silent or to 
protest the impermissibility of breaching the norms of official 
ethics. The sole way of expressing one's position in a 
situation when you are a member of a team is not to impose 
political assessments on your colleagues. And if you have to 
talk about a breach of ethics, this must be done after you 
resign. This is how I acted, announcing my resignation. This 
is my right. And it is the right of the president and the 
premier to accept or reject this resignation. 
  The resignation was not accepted. There were meetings with 
the president and the premier. My further tasks, duties, and 
functions under the new conditions were clarified. And the most 
important thing for me here was that nationalities and regional 
policy remained under my jurisdiction, as vice premier. 
Moreover, representatives of many regions requested the 
country's leadership not to accept my resignation. In this 
situation I considered it inappropriate to insist on my 
resignation. (It would be very important for me to express 
through this newspaper my gratitude to those who supported me in 
those days). On the other hand, what has happened helped me 
identify both my true allies and adversaries, and even 
"traitors." A valuable experience. 
  The question of resignation was closed; the conversation 
with 
the president moved to more urgent matters: on regional and 
nationalities policy, drafting a treaty on Kaliningrad Oblast, 
and mechanisms and implementation of the treaty between the 
power bodies of Russia and Tatarstan. In view of the numerous 
insinuations and rumors about my resignation being related to 
the upcoming negotiations with Chechnya, I asked directly 
whether I had been removed from the position of chief negotiator 
at the talks on a settlement with the Chechen Republic which I 
led in accordance with the president's message and a Duma 
resolution. The answer was negative. 
  I introduced the new minister to the ministry collective, 
which I think was very important psychologically both for him 
and myself. We shall work. [passage omitted] 
  [Molchanov] As vice premier, which matters will you oversee 
now? 
  [Shakhray] They include the following sets of questions: 
First, nationalities and regional policy; second, interaction 
with legislative and judicial bodies. (After all I have 
experience of working in parliament and in the government). 
  My terms of reference also include matters of interaction 
between the government and the mass media. I stress: 
interaction, not supervision, coordination, or direction. Not 
as it is envisioned in the TV and radio broadcasting plan 
drafted by the State Duma. I consider one of the major 
shortfalls in the government's performance the inability to 
explain its decisions, take public reaction into account, and 
shape public opinion.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ludmila Yermakova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 3 June -- Money has been allocated for cargo 
to northern regions, and the transportation of goods has already 
begun, Vice Prime Minister Sergey Shakhray, who is in charge of 
a commission entrusted to regulate transportation, told 
ITAR-TASS. He said that one trillion rubles over the next two 
months has been allocated for the transportation of cargo. The 
task in this period is to supply only those areas with a limited 
navigation season with only petroleum products, coal, and four 
types of food. 
  According to the State Duma's deputy, parliamentary hearings 
held in April in the two chambers helped to resolve this issue. 
They also showed that a new legislative basis was needed for 
these regions. "Random market relations in the north will not 
produce any good results on their own. State regulatory 
measures are needed," he stressed. 
  The participants in today's hearings in the Federation 
Council on social-economic and cultural issues came to similar 
conclusions, the deputy noted. "Everyone is convinced that the 
transformation to free market relations is a noose around the 
neck of indigenous peoples," he pointed out. Venison and other 
traditional foodstuffs prices have nothing to do with the market 
relations. That is why they need state subsidies. This will be 
less expensive than moving the northerners to towns. Sergey 
Shakhray recalled that in Canada and in Alaska, in spite of the 
market, state regulation of prices is tight. 
  He pointed out that "the development of resources in the 
north is an issue of maintaining the ethnic composition of the 
area." That is why one of the conditions for granting contracts 
for the development of the natural resources will be making 
deductions set by the law for protecting the habitat and forms 
of local economic forms.

<F P=106> [SEGODNYA report under the "Special Services" rubric: "A </F>
New Directorate Will Be Set Up in the FCS"] 
  [Text] A special operations directorate is likely to be 
created in Russia's Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS]. 
FCS sources confirmed to INTERFAX 3 June that this possibility 
was discussed in the course of Russian Federation President 
Boris Yeltsin's visit to the counterintelligence service's 
headquarters late in May. It is supposed that power structures 
-- special units of the "Alfa" and "Vympel" groups type -- will 
be set up under the special operations directorate. 
  Earlier both groups were part of the KGB structure before 
they were transferred to the Main Directorate for the 
President's Security, while some time ago "Vympel" was once 
again reassigned, this time to the Russian Federation Ministry 
of Internal Affairs. A number of officers of this special unit 
refused to be transferred to the Ministry of Internal Affairs 
and were taken on by the FCS. Mr. Yerin's agency is planning to 
create a special union named "Vega" on the basis of what remains 
of "Vympel." Let us remind you that the "A" group ("Alfa") was 
created on Andropov's initiative to combat terrorism, whereas 
"Vympel" is a former unit of the KGB's First Main Directorate 
(Foreign Intelligence Service) designed to carry out "in-depth 
intelligence activities" (intelligence-sabotage-terrorist 
activities in the rear of the potential adversary). 
  Mr. Stepashin told a news briefing that in the FCS structure 
there are several off-the-books "commando groups" [gruppy 
zakhvata] within the major territorial directorates. According 
to information from confidential sources, it is not ruled out 
that the forming of the new directorate will be entrusted to 
General Dmitriy Gerasimov, former commander of "Vympel."

Enterprises" signed by Russian Federation President Boris 
Yeltsin on 2 June; by ITAR-TASS] 
  [Text] Moscow, 3 Jun 
<H5>  On the Sale of State Debtor Enterprises </H5>
  With a view to implementing state policy aimed at preventing 
the insolvency (bankruptcy) of enterprises and the negative 
social consequences connected with the reorganization and 
liquidation of insolvent enterprises, should they be declared 
insolvent (bankrupt), I decree: 
  1. State enterprises whose accounts balance have been 
declared unsatisfactory and an enterprise that has been declared 
insolvent (this is known henceforth as the debtor enterprise), 
in accordance with Resolution No. 498 of the Government of the 
Russian Federation of 20 May 1994 "On Measures to Implement 
Legislative Acts on Insolvency (Bankruptcy)", should be sold in 
accordance with this decree. 
  2. The accompanying provision on the procedure for selling 
state debtor enterprises should be approved. 
  The provision on the procedure for selling state debtor 
enterprises should be applied to: state-owned debtor 
enterprises for which a privatization plan has not been approved 
according to established procedures by the time the decision is 
adopted on their accounts balance being unsatisfactory and the 
enterprises being insolvent; and, to the packages of the debtor 
enterprises' shares that belong to the state. 
  3. The sale of state debtor enterprises that are declared 
bankrupt should be accomplished in the following ways: 
  --by sale through competitive bidding, on a commercial or 
investment basis, of debtor enterprises that will maintain their 
status as legal entities; 
  --by the liquidation of debtor enterprises with the 
subsequent sale of their property (assets) at auctions or 
through competitive bidding, on a commercial or investment basis; 
  --by selling at auction the state-owned portions of the 
stock 
(shares) of debtor enterprises. 
  4. If insolvency of state-owned enterprises is caused by 
circumstances that are not immediately connected with a delayed 
payment of a state order from the federal budget or from the 
budget of a member of the Russian Federation, the head of the 
enterprise who, being considered unfit for his position, should 
be deemed responsible for the insolvency of the enterprise. 
  As soon as an enterprise is declared insolvent and having an 
unsatisfactory accounts balance, the rights to sign and cancel 
contracts with the head of the debtor enterprise are transferred 
to the Federal Department for Insolvency (bankruptcy) under the 
State Committee of the Russian Federation for Management of 
State Property or to an appropriate executive body of a member 
of the Russian Federation. 
  The question of relieving the head of the debtor enterprise 
of his duties, as unfit for his position, will be considered 
simultaneously with making the decision to declare a state-owned 
enterprise insolvent and as having an unsatisfactory accounts 
balance. 
  In the event that the head of a debtor enterprise is 
relieved 
from his duties, there will be no new appointment, but the 
Federal Department for Insolvency (bankruptcy) under the State 
Committee of the Russian Federation for Management of State 
Property or an appropriate executive body of a member of the 
Russian Federation will conclude an agreement with an individual 
(the manager), subcontracting the management of the debtor 
enterprise until it has been sold to a new owner. 
  5. When preparing plans for the privatization of 
enterprises, the Russian Federation State Committee for the 
Management of State Property and property management committees 
in components [subyekty] of the Russian Federation should 
analyze the financial condition of enterprises in accordance 
with the criteria approved by the Russian Federation Government 
for determining an unsatisfactory balance structure. 
  6. The sale of debtor enterprises around which new towns 
have been created should be carried out in accordance with the 
special rules set by the Russian Federation Government. 
  The Russian Federation Government is to approve within two 
months a provision on the procedure for classifying enterprises 
as enterprises around which new towns have been created and the 
special rules for the sale of debtor enterprises around which 
new towns have been created. 
  7. The Russian Federation government should: 
  --speed up the preparation of a draft law establishing the 
criminal and administrative responsibility of the management of 
an enterprise for actions causing the enterprise to go bankrupt; 
  --approve within one month the norms for the distribution of 
resources obtained from the sale of debtor enterprises and of 
their property (assets) and stock (shares), in accordance with 
the ways in which they are used, which have been defined by the 
provision on the procedure for the sale of state-owned debtor 
enterprises. 
  8. Local government bodies should be recommended to carry 
out the sale of municipally owned debtor enterprises in 
accordance with the rules stipulated by the provision on the 
procedure for the sale of state-owned debtor enterprises. 
  The present decree comes into force from the moment of its 
publication. 
  [signed] Boris Yeltsin

  [Text] Russia is not short of oil and is ready to export 
more, the Ministry of Fuel and Energy said in a report prepared 
by its experts. By the beginning of last month the country had 
more than 6.5 million barrels of crude oil unsold. This is more 
than average reserves. Among the factors restricting the sale 
of oil are disproportionately high government taxes and prices. 
As a result, the experts say, even oil exports have become 
ineffective.

land resources and land tenure Nikolay Komov told Interfax that 
by August 1, 20 Mn Russians would be formally recognized as 
owners of plots of land. 
  According to Komov, every villager, member of a 
horticulturists' association, small farmer or person who was 
given his share of the collective farm's land would be issued a 
certificate to confirm his ownership of a plot of land. 
  Komov described the certificate as a legal document which 
confirms the citizens' right to own land and the necessary 
condition for the sale and purchase of land in Russia. 
  According to Komov's land committee, more than 1 Mn Russians 
are still waiting to get a plot of land for green-fingering and 
more than 7,OOO citizens are waiting to get a plot of land for 
farming. 
  Komov said the national land redistribution fund controled 
66 
Mn hectares, 20.1 percent of which were farming land. As many 
as 16.6 Mn Russian villagers had registered as owners of a total 
of six million hectares of land. More than 270,000 small 
farmers possessed a total of 11.3 Mn hectares and 14.3 Mn 
families were registered as members of horticulturists' 
associations.

<F P=106> [Igor Petrov report under the rubric "Decision in </F>
Preparation": "Government Intends To Index Link Minimum Wage"] 
  [Text] It seems that the many debates about the need, on 
the one hand, to combat inflation by restricting the growth in 
the money supply and, on the other, to prevent a social 
explosion will end soon. 
  As your ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent has learned from 
reliable sources, documents providing for an increase in the 
minimum wage in the country have already been placed on the desk 
of Government Chairman Viktor Chernomyrdin. According to the 
Labor Ministry's proposals adjusted to take into account the 
opinion of the Finance Ministry and the Federation of 
Independent Trade Unions, it is proposed to index the minimum 
wage by a factor of 1.4 as of 1 July. Thus it will rise from 
14,620 rubles [R] to R20,500. The same factor will be applied 
to the calculation of wages in the budget-funded sectors of the 
economy. Category One of the Single Wages Schedule, which 
determines wages in all budget-funded organizations, will rise 
from R16,000 to R22,400. This is the figure which will form the 
basis for setting the wages of workers in the public sector. 
  The Labor Ministry's proposals finally reflect the 
differentiated approach to the formation of the incomes of 
various categories of workers. In practice, this should mean 
extra financial increments that will be paid to workers in the 
first four categories of the Single Wages Schedule. Total pay 
in, for example, Category One will be no less than the minimum 
pension plus all the extras [nakrutki], and this will amount to 
R39,000. This will be the actual rate for a worker in Category 
One of the Single Wages Schedule. 
  This is surely the first time in the short history of pay 
indexation that these proposals have been given the full support 
of the Finance Ministry. Furthermore, the financial experts 
have given an assurance that if this indexation is implemented 
as of 1 July, as planned, the money required for that purpose 
will be allocated from the budget in full and in that month.

  [Text] Russia plans a 10-fold reduction of its nuclear 
arsenals by the year 2003. This has been announced by Atomic 
Energy Minister Viktor Mikhaylov. According to him, Russia will 
retain 3,500 highly efficient nuclear warheads capable of 
defending it from any form of aggression. As to nuclear weapons 
cuts, Moscow spends up to 1,000 billion rubles a year for these 
purposes. An agreement with the United States on processing 
weapon-grade uranium into fuel for nuclear power stations only 
partially compensates for the losses incurred by Russia due to 
the destruction of the nuclear weapons of Ukraine, Belarus, and 
Kazakhstan.

    [Editorial report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel Network in Russian at 0820 GMT on 5 June, in its program 
entitled "Aerospace salon," carries a 4-minute report on two 
major hushed-up space launch failures in 1969, at the height of 
the space race between the USSR and the United States. The 
report shows for the first time previously classified pictures 
of two launch failures. 
  In the first decade of the space age, the U.S.'s Mariner-IV 
probe had already succeeded in sending back to Earth the first 
pictures of Mars, while all six Soviet Mars probes had failed to 
reach their target. 
  "In 1969, the United States was planning to launch a further 
two Mariner probes to Mars," the program says. "For this reason 
the leadership of the Soviet Union ordered the leading 
enterprise for interplanetary probes, the Lavochkin 
scientific-production association, to urgently create probes for 
the orbital exploration of Mars." 
  On the basis of the new UR-500K rocket, later redesignated 
as the Proton rocket, the Lavochkin enterprise hastily developed 
the five-tonne M-69 Mars probe. However, following the 
successful launch by the United States of Mariner-VI on 25 
February 1969, the first attempted Soviet launch of a M-69 Mars 
probe on 27 March failed. Just "438 seconds after its launch 
the rocket's third stage motor exploded" and the probe perished. 
Later the same day, 27 March, the Americans successfully 
launched Mariner-VII. On 2 April, the second attempted Soviet 
launch of an M-69 probe produced yet another failure. 
"Immediately after the start of the launch, a fire broke out in 
the rocket's first-stage motor" and after rising just a short 
distance, the rocket plunged back to Earth close to the 
launching area. 
  The Ostankino television program showed footage of both 
space launch failures. "Very few people have previously seen 
this footage," the program says. Two official TASS 
announcements about the successful launching of Mars-2 and 
Mars-3 probes, which had been compiled beforehand and later had 
to be cancelled before their publication in the media, were also 
shown on screen. At the time, the Soviet media did not mention 
these failures.

<F P=106> [Ivan Zasurskiy report under the "Finances" rubric: </F>
"Federation Council Recommends To Hike Spending. The Military 
To Get 55 Trillion"] 
  [Text] In a closed session yesterday, the Federation 
Council accepted as a basis the decree "On the Course of Shaping 
the 1994 Federal Budget," which calls for a notable increase in 
the number of defense and social-sphere expenditure items. 
  The decree recommends to the State Duma "to increase in the 
expenditure part of the budget financial aid to the other levels 
of power up to 23 trillion rubles [R], including the financing 
of outlays for the maintenance of facilities in the social 
sphere and the housing stock which is being turned over under 
the authority of local bodies of state power in 1994, by R7.3 
trillion," "to increase defense spending to R55 trillion," to 
regard it as necessary to replenish the financial aid fund 
through Central Bank emission credits rather than through 
transfers from the federal budget, "to regard it necessary to 
accept R4.3 trillion as the sum to cover the creation of 
regional food funds in the budget to be distributed among the 
specific regions." One of the recommendations to the State Duma 
asks it "to establish a system of priorities for the 
distribution of emission credits so as to provide finances in a 
timely manner to those regions that lack them." 
  As regards an increase in defense spending, the Federation 
Council suggests itemizing the funds thus: R12 trillion for 
arms purchases, up to R5.5 trillion for research and development 
work, and up to R8 trillion for capital construction, while 
outlays for the maintenance of the Armed Forces should be cut 
from R28 trillion to R25.8 trillion. 
  Thus, the decision so far accepted "as a basis" restores the 
Defense Ministry's and the military-industrial complex's share 
of participation in the budget to the one initially planned 
during the Finance Ministry's drafting of the budget message, 
which, however, was reduced before having been put before the 
State Duma. 
  The Federation Council asked the Duma to increase the budget 
deficit attributed to defense items to R18 trillion in all. 
Commenting on this decision by the upper house of parliament, 
Senator Nikolay Gonchar stated that the Federation Council 
"wants no standoff with the government; it weighs the interests 
of the government and the country as a whole, and if the 
country's interests tip scales, this is normal." If the State 
Duma fails to consider the Federation Council's expenditure 
recommendations, the senators would go back to discussing their 
budget amendments after the budget has been put to the upper 
house of parliament for approval. According to Nikolay Gonchar, 
the Federation Council decision is not in recognition of 
Glazyev's budget, although there are constructive aspects on the 
Duma economist's stance. However, "Glazyev's additional incomes 
can go to patch up the holes in the old budget." 
  More critical of the decree were Yuriy Chernichenko and 
Boris 
Nemtsov, who talked to journalists. A chagrined Mr. 
Chernichenko said it was guns before butter. Boris Nemtsov 
thought it necessary to hold an independent item-by-item study 
of the budget expenditure, because it could yield rather 
unexpected results. Arguing against the funds for military 
capital construction, Boris Nemtsov stated that he "has no use 
for Defense Ministry funds to build a home for some officer 
named Ivanov, for example, in Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast," while it 
would be sensible to arrange for personal bank accounts to 
transfer the money that can only be spent by its owner for 
housing construction. "Eight trillion means 400,000 officers 
would be able to have decent homes built for them." To 
illustrate the justice of the claims made by Nemtsov, who spoke 
at the session, it suffices to recall the recent con jobs in the 
United States where hammers ordered by the government were sold 
at a thousand bucks each.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 3 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- An extra-budgetary fund 
of social support for Russian military servicemen has been 
created at the Main Directorate for the Military Budget and 
Financing of the Russian Defense Ministry. An ITAR-TASS 
correspondent was told of this today by Colonel Aleksandr 
Goncharov of the Defense Ministry's information and press 
department. 
  He said that the money will come from the activities of the 
military insurance company. According to a Russian Federation 
Defense Ministry directive, it will be used to stage military- 
patriotic and cultural events and to organize meetings with the 
participants of wars and veterans of the armed forces. It is 
also envisioned to use the money from the extra-budgetary fund 
to pay for the treatment of servicemen and their families, to 
provide gratuitous financial assistance to large families, and 
particularly servicemen in need, and as subsidies to public 
catering enterprises located in officers' houses and officers' 
clubs.

<F P=106> [Boris Averyanov article under the "Pacifism" rubric: </F>
"There May Be No Next Call-Up Unless There Is a Law on 
Alternative Service"] 
  [Text] The legal vacuum in the sphere of alternative 
service for induction-age youth threatens trouble for the 
Russian Armed Forces. Under the Constitution, "every citizen of 
the Russian Federation, if his convictions in the matter of 
faith contradict with military service.... has the right to 
substitute it with an alternative civil service." (Article 59, 
Item 3). 
  In the meantime there is still no law on alternative service 
(as, naturally, there is no alternative service itself), and any 
youth of draft age may turn to the president and demand that his 
constitutional rights be observed, and demand the right not to 
serve at all because "objectors" protected by the Constitution 
are not called up today for alternative service. If things 
continue this way, the number of those wanting to capitalize on 
the "flawed" legislation may snowball by the time of the autumn 
draft. 
  The State Duma committees on public organizations and 
defense 
have prepared two alternative drafts on alternative service. 
The man in charge of the first one, Vitaliy Savitskiy, chairman 
of the subcommittee on religious organizations and cochairman of 
the Russian Christian Democratic Union, said on his arrival in 
St. Peterburg that an agreement has been reached with Defense 
Committee Chairman Sergey Yushenkov to merge both drafts -- the 
result would be passed on to the Duma for consideration. But 
how does one combine them when they differ in their approach 
right from the start? For example, the draft Mr. Savitskiy is 
in charge of and which was developed by a group led by Anatoliy 
Pchelintsev, director of the Institute of Religion and Law, and 
Vladimir Rikhovskiy, director of the Christian Juridical Center, 
is remarkable for a much more liberal approach. 
  It is doubtful that the "defense people" will easily agree 
with the articles of their "rivals'" draft, but Mr. Savitskiy 
looks to the future with optimism: The Defense Committee, whose 
draft he thinks looks "rather raw," is simply up the creek. A 
further non-passage of the law may simply result in a disruption 
of the autumn draft on quite legal grounds, let us note. All 
this makes the Defense Committee work together with the authors 
of the first draft if only it nears the main goal -- the passing 
of the law as soon as possible. 
  If the new committees really manage to produce a joint 
draft, 
it is not ruled out that the law on alternative service would be 
passed by the Duma rather quickly. Those in the Defense 
Committee realize that procrastination is fraught with a 
disruption of the new draft for an army which is thinning out as 
it is, whereas the committee on relations with religious 
organizations hopes that, in addition to everything else, the 
new law would humanize the army. "With its passage the army 
chiefs would have to try and see that the horrors of military 
service do not make draftees seek alternative service," the 
subcommittee head, Mr. Savitskiy, thinks. "Conditions of army 
service should not be worse that working in hospitals, and then 
the only ones who would try to get into the ranks of alternative 
servicemen would be those who cannot take up arms for their 
convictions."

  [Text] The Russian Defense Ministry proposed a new military 
mobilizing concept for industry aimed at a sharp reduction of 
the reserve capacities in order to mobilize them during an 
emergency period. First Deputy Russian Defense Minister Andrey 
Kokoshin told Interfax today that this was due to the altered 
evaluation of the character of any potential war or armed 
conflict and of the present economic realities when it was 
necessary to pay for everything. 
  Kokoshin added that the Russian Defense Ministry was in 
favor 
of producing jets, helicopters, satellite and other supervising 
systems at military-industrial enterprises. He said if the 
defense industry enterprises started to make civil products, 
this would help to preserve the scientific and technical 
potential of these enterprises. Such enterprises will be the 
main resources of the country in a period of emergency. 
  Kokoshin stressed that officers of the Defense Ministry and 
other departments were not unanimous in their assessment of the 
new concept. The State Committee on the Defense Industry and 
the Economic Ministry are also arguing on the issue.

  [Text] Moscow June 3 TASS -- Russian deputies have 
recommended the soonest ratification of the Treaty on 
Commonwealth Economic Union at today's parliamentary hearings in 
the Federation Council, the upper parliament chamber. 
  Russia is the only Commonwealth state that has not ratified 
the document. The hearings confirmed that the document 
corresponds to the Russian interests and aims to form common 
economic space in the Commonwealth to be based on market economy 
principles. 
  The Russian government is offered to work for the creation 
of 
a free trade zone, customs and payment unions proceeding from 
the need to settle credit, monetary, currency and financial 
relations with the Commonwealth republics. 
  Russian vice-premier Aleksandr Shokhin told correspondents 
that hundreds of Commonwealth agreements are inefficient. A new 
working body of the economic union should help to elaborate and 
implement cooperation documents, he said. Organizational 
economic structures of the Commonwealth are too weak, and Russia 
supports the initiative to create an inter-state economic 
committee, added Shokhin.

  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin "is likely to use 
some form of persuasion on the upper chamber of the Russian 
parliament in order to force a positive decision on the 
introduction of Russian peacekeepers into Abkhazia during the 
second consideration of this problem by the Federation Council," 
an employee of the presidential administration declared to 
Interfax Friday. 
  He expressed his supposition saying that the refusal to 
support the presidential address regarding forces' introduction 
voiced the day before is "a kind of a gesture, an appeal to the 
presidential team to develop such documents thoroughly." The 
employee has no doubts that the majority of the Federation 
Council understands the need to conduct a peacekeeping operation 
in Transcaucasus. 
  The second consideration of the issue on introduction of 
peacekeepers into Abkhazia in the Federation Council is 
scheduled for June 21. 
  According to an Interfax source, "a slight" delay in the 
introduction of peacekeepers into Abkhazia "is an unpleasant but 
not a fatal fact." He does not predict any threat of resumption 
of a widescale conflict between Georgia and Abkhazia.

<F P=106> [Petr Zhuravlev report under the "Peacekeeping" rubric: </F>
"Deputy Zatulin Pained at Federation Council's Abkhazia 
Decision. Senators Have `No Details Explained' to Them"] 
  [Text] Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the Duma committee 
for CIS affairs, had "nothing left but to express regret" at the 
fact that President Yeltsin's call about the need to send to 
Abkhazia a Russian peacekeeping contingent found no support in 
the Federation Council on 2 June. At a specially called news 
briefing yesterday, Mr. Zatulin discussed this regret and his 
hope that this decision will not lead to an escalation of the 
Georgia-Abkhazia conflict. 
  The Duma committee head, who on Thursday attended the upper 
chamber sitting to discuss the president's call, said that 
senators who voted against were guided mainly by three motives. 
First, in Mr. Zatulin's words, many "were especially agitated 
about sending Russian soldiers" to a zone of armed standoff (the 
motive was called illogical, incompetent, and populist because 
the participation of a Russian contingent in the peacekeeping 
operation in Bosnia had been approved at one time). Second, the 
senators feared additional outlays that may run to between 3-9 
billion rubles. (Mr. Zatulin was told that the Federation 
Council approved that same Thursday a proposal to increase the 
budget expenditure side, and "why cry over spilt milk....") 
Third, and which also played its role, was the fact that the 
presence of soldiers even on Russia's territory -- the emergency 
situation zone in Ossetia and Ingushetia -- has so far not been 
very helpful in solving the crisis there. (Brushing aside this 
argument, Mr. Zatulin said that had there been no troops, this, 
as in fact any such conflict, would have been "even much more 
bloody"). 
  According to Konstantin Zatulin, an alternative to sending 
CIS peacemaking forces to Abkhazia is the presence there of an 
international UN contingent, for the participation in which 
Turkey, Uruguay, and several more countries have already 
applied. This, however, the committee chairman thinks, would 
lead to Russia's losing influence in the region and the 
declining authority and prestige of our country on the world 
scene. Generally, Mr. Zatulin said, it is bad that the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs or the president's staff, who obviously 
continue to regard the Federation Council as a chamber "loyal" 
to the president, paid no due attention to the question and did 
not properly explain everything to the senators. Mr. Zatulin, 
however, is confident that following a recess in the chamber's 
work, the senators will after all support the peacemaking 
initiative of not Moscow alone but of also of Alma-Ata [Almaty], 
Bishkek, Tashkent, Dushanbe, Yerevan, Baku, and even Tbilisi.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 3 June -- The situation that arose in the 
State Duma as a result of the examination of this year's federal 
draft budget should not be dramatized, said Valentin Kovalev, 
deputy chairman of the State Duma. 
  The clause on the proposed military expenditure was the 
stumbling block: The State Duma approved it as 37 trillion 
rubles in the first reading, but the Federation Council brought 
it up to 55 trillion, thereby increasing it by 18 trillion 
rubles. "I want to stress that these decisions are not final, 
but just a process; the parliamentarians are continuing their 
considerable and tense work," Valentin Kovalev told the 
ITAR-TASS correspondent who asked him for his comments. 
  "I do not think that the military budget is an issue for 
conflict, although I would like to remind you that a 
conciliation procedure exists within the framework of the 
Federal Assembly between the State Duma and the Federation 
Council," he said. "We proceed from the premise that the 
conciliation procedure should be permanent, and we will resolve 
all contradictory questions within its framework consistently. 
I am convinced that the chambers will reach agreement," 
Valentin Kovalev stressed. 
  Asked what the reaction of the deputies in the State Duma 
might be to the Federation Council's decision, although not yet 
final, he noted that "predictions are thankless things, 
especially if one takes into account the fact that we have 10 
factions and deputies' groups plus another unregistered group of 
deputies. That means there are 11 points of view on every 
question. Proceeding from this, it is difficult to make any 
prediction, but I am convinced that within the framework of the 
conciliation procedure which operates not only between the 
chambers but but also between the factions and deputies' groups, 
we will reach a mutually acceptable decision which will be to 
the liking not only of the Federal Assembly and the government, 
but also of the country as a whole," Valentin Kovalev stressed.

  [Text] Moscow, June 3 (YONHAP) -- Presidents Kim Yong-sam 
of South Korea and Bill Clinton of the United States agreed 
Friday that they have no other choice but to press the U.N. 
Security Council [UNSC] to adopt a resolution imposing sanctions 
against North Korea. 
  The agreement came in a 30-minute telephone conversation 
from 
7:15 P.M. Moscow time. The call was made by Clinton in Rome, 
where the U.S. President is attending events commemorating the 
50th anniversary of D-day. 
  President Kim received the call as he wound up his four-day 
state visit to Russia. 
  The United States has completed preparations for a better 
and 
firmer defense of South Korea, Clinton told Kim, according to 
presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik. 
  Chu said he could not disclose further details of the 
presidential conversation. 
  Prior to talking with Kim, Clinton called Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin and told him that the North Korean nuclear row 
will now have to be dealt with by the U.N. Security Council. 
  Details of the Clinton-Yeltsin call were not disclosed 
either, but the U.S. President was understood to have phoned 
Yeltsin in order to secure Russian support for the Security 
Council plans. They also reportedly discussed taking concerted 
steps between the United States and South Korea along with Japan 
and China.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Nikolay Geronin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 6 TASS -- A high-ranking Russian foreign 
ministry official hinted on Monday that Russia may not support 
sanctions against North Korea if they are imposed by the United 
States, Japan and South Korea without a UN approval. 
  "Russia, as well as China, has major trade and economic 
interests in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. That is 
why Moscow will take into consideration its economic interests 
in relations with the DPRK while working out its position 
towards trilateral sanctions against Pyongyang", the official 
told TASS on Monday. 
  However, he added that the common goal of Russia and other 
states is to ensure the nuclear-free status of the Korean 
peninsula and make North Korea observe the nuclear 
non-proliferation regime. 
  The official reiterated the position voiced by President 
Boris Yeltsin that Russia stands for a gradual approach to 
sanctions against Pyongyang and said all other measures are to 
be used first. "Moscow believes that it is necessary to try and 
use all possible political measures without infringing on the 
interests of the sides", the official stressed. 
  He recalled the proposal of the Russian president to convene 
an international conference on security and nuclear-free status 
of the Korean peninsula. "This proposal does not mean that 
other variants of the settlement are brushed aside", he added.

<F P=106> [By Nobuyuki Tanaka; from NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 4 Jun Evening </F>
Edition] 
  [Text] Moscow, 3 Jun -- With economic sanctions against 
the DPRK (North Korea) looking more possible as a result of 
phone conversation between top leaders of the United States and 
South Korea [ROK], Russia is watching U.S. moves, but will soon 
reiterate its call for an eight-party international conference 
proposed by President Yeltsin. The eight parties referred to 
are South and North Korea, Japan, the United States, China, 
Russia, the United Nations, and the International Atomic Energy 
Agency. 
  Russia, which appears to be treading an idependent 
diplomatic 
course by drawing a line with the Western camp since early this 
year, is concerned lest the DPRK question be resolved under U.S. 
leadership. Even though it basically has no intention of 
objecting to economic sanctions, it has not withdrawn from its 
position of calling for a meeting of the eight parties before 
taking that action. 
  According to a Russian Foreign Ministry source, even within 
the ministry there are voices of self-reproach saying: "We have 
pushed the DPRK too far into a corner by approaching the ROK 
promptly following the collapse of the Soviet Union." Given the 
situation, there is no choice but for the country to be cautious 
about economic sanctions at this stage. 
  It is also true that this issue draws little concern in 
parliament and among the public as compared to the Bosnian 
issue, wherein the problem of Slavic Serbs is involved. 
Besides, with economic ties with the ROK only growing, what 
Russia most likely wants to do most is to stay away from making 
decisive confrontations with the United States and the ROK over 
the DPRK nuclear issue.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: By correspondents </F>
Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others] 
  [Text] Deputy Russian Foreign Minister Alexander Panov said 
that the treaty between the ex-USSR and Russia [as received] 
evidently was not in line with the present realities and could 
no longer exist as it was. He said that the treaty would expire 
in two years. "In accordance with this document, one party must 
notify the other on its intention to extend or not to extend the 
treaty. This means we still have a year," Panov stressed. 
  Panov said that Russia had already proposed to North Korea 
to 
review the treaty. "That is to say the message to Pyongyang has 
already been sent," he concluded. 
  Moscow does not rule out that the issue concerning sanctions 
against North Korea could be submitted for consideration of the 
UN Security Council, Chief of the Russian Foreign Ministry First 
Asian Department Mikhail Beliy said in an interview with 
Interfax today. 
  Bely said that the matter was becoming serious since 
Pyongyang was refusing to negotiate with the International 
Atomic Energy Agency on reloading the nuclear reactor. 
  Bely pointed out that sanctions were the last resort. "In 
principle, sanctions could be imposed. However, all other 
political opportunities must be exhausted before this," he 
remarked. 
  Bely believes that not every method has as yet been applied 
to influence Pyongyang. "After the talks between North Korea and 
the U.S.A. failed, the Russian initiative on an international 
conference on security and non-nuclear status of the Korean 
peninsula was high on the agenda. I think the time has come to 
try to settle this issue on the whole," he underlined. 
  Commenting on the future of the treaty between ex-USSR and 
North Korea (since Russia was the legal successor of the USSR), 
Beliy said, "The first provision of this treaty providing for 
assistance to Pyongyang in case of an aggression against it is 
not really in force. Only in case of a non-provoked aggression 
against North Korea will we establish how much it conforms with 
our understanding of the treaty. We will be thinking how to 
amend the document."

  [Text] Oleg Soskovets, the Russian first deputy chairman of 
the Council of Ministers, believes that the relations between 
Russia and South Korea should develop not to the detriment to 
contacts with North Korea. I wouldn't like to talk of sharp 
confrontation with North Korea, Soskovets told a RIA 
correspondent. 
  Russian firms and enterprises display noticeable interest in 
North Korea. The former USSR built their many enterprises and 
production capacities. This is our potential machine -- the 
metallurgic and energy market -- and it is not expedient to lose 
it for political reasons. At the same time the deputy prime 
minister pointed out that North Korea should unconditionally 
comply with the UN demands on nuclear power engineering.

<F P=106> [Viktor Zamyatin article: "North Korea Nuclear Weapons </F>
Problem. Washington Ready To Impose Sanctions, Pyongyang Ready 
To Start War"] 
  [Excerpts] Although Boris Yeltsin did state at the meeting 
with his South Korean counterpart Kim Yong-sam that it is still 
early to speak of sanctions against the DPRK, yesterday's 
developments indicate otherwise. It is believed in Washington, 
Tokyo, and Seoul, as well as in the IAEA that sanctions are 
already a must -- so far has Pyongyang gone in its stubbornness. 
[passage omitted] 
  The IAEA proposes to the UN Security Council that political 
pressure be brought to bear on Pyongyang, and if those do not 
work, sanctions should be applied. The need for raising the 
question of sanctions against the DPRK in the UN Security 
Council was also discussed by Bill Clinton, who is in Italy, 
should the conclusions drawn by IAEA chief Blix be confirmed. 
In his words, the United States would press for sanctions even 
if Pyongyang regards this an "act of a declaration of war." 
[passage omitted] 
  Not all UN Security Council permanent members, however, 
agree 
with Washington's arguments. Expressing their concern over the 
North Korea nuclear weapons problem, Moscow and Beijing prefer a 
more cautious position. Today Russia explains it by possible 
economic losses, pointing to the Iraq, Libya, and Yugoslavia 
precedents. Nevertheless it is still unclear how the Russian 
representative is going to act in a possible vote in the 
Security Council. More likely than not, China would as always 
abstain. According to a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement, 
Beijing would not like the use of measures that could worsen the 
situation. 
  Pyongyang, meanwhile, is absolutely obviously preparing for 
war -- according to the statement of a North Korean politician, 
"sanctions, without a doubt, would lead to destructive 
consequences in Asia and the rest of the world, let alone the 
Korean Peninsula." According to CNN information, the DPRK 
flight-tested two rockets that can carry nuclear warheads. 
Shilly-shallying by the international community may entail 
unpredictable consequences.

Saturday and hurried to the United States, where sanctions are 
being discussed against North Korea. South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam, here on a summit visit, instructed Han to go to the

  Han hopes to stop off in London for special talks with U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who is accompanying 
President Bill Clinton on a visit to Europe, the aides said. 
  The U.N. Security Council will begin serious negotiations on 
a sanctions resolution against North Korea from next week, 
setting deadlines and the degree of sanctions to resolve the 
nuclear crisis. 
  Han is expected to fly to New York for talks with U.N. 
Secretary-general Butrus Butrus-Ghali and Security Council 
President Salim Bin Mohammed al-Khussaiby as well as ambassadors 
from the United States, Japan, China and Russia. 
  In Washington, Han will confer with administration officials 
to coordinate policies and future countermeasures on the nuclear 
problem.

<F P=106> [Speech by ROK President Kim Yong-sam at the Russian </F>
Federation Council in Moscow on 2 June -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] Esteemed chairman and council members: I am 
very happy to have this opportunity to speak at the Federation 
Council, which was formed through the first free elections in 
the history of Russia, about my views on the future of the ROK 
and Russia. I have been deeply interested in the Russian 
parliament's giant steps toward creating a new history and 
visited in 1989 and 1990 during the period of the former Soviet 
Union. [passage omitted] 
  This time, I have again come to Moscow, a city of beautiful 
culture and long history, in order to build ROK-Russian 
relations. [passage omitted] 
  I recognize the potential power of Russia in the fact that 
it 
repelled invasions by Napoleon and Hitler to be the last 
fortress of world peace. Russia was twice the focus of changes 
in the world history of the 20th century. Its advanced science 
and technology, which launched the world's first space rocket, 
were precious assets for mankind. I firmly believe in the great 
spirit and potential power of the Russian people who created the 
culture and arts that shine today in the history of mankind. 
  Council members: This morning I exchanged frank 
conversations with President Yeltsin. I firmly believe that the 
ROK and Russia can become reliable partners for mutual 
prosperity in the upcoming 21st century. We can cooperate with 
each other for success in each other's ongoing reforms. We can 
closely cooperate for the reunification of the Korean peninsula 
and for our common prosperity. 
  The ROK and Russia are today enveloped in the surging waves 
of great change and reform. With the collapse of the Cold-War 
structure and the settlement of the Uruguay Round negotiations, 
the world order is undergoing rapid reorganization. Some people 
refer to this as the beginning of an era of globalization, and 
others say that the post-industrial era has come to an end. 
However they may all be called changes of the times, and 
history will make stragglers of not only all countries, but also 
all individuals, who remain idle in the existing system. 
  The ROK and Russia are carrying out reforms, while 
surmounting many sacrifices and pains, in order not to become 
stragglers in the new era and, furthermore, in order to pioneer 
a more stable and affluent era. The ROK is stepping up its 
reforms in order to strengthen its competitive power based on 
the democratization and economic development it has achieved so 
far. With the success of these reforms, the ROK will see a 
decisive opportunity for another leap. I firmly believe that 
the ROK's reforms will create a new prosperous ROK and achieve a 
peaceful, reunified ROK [pyonghwaroun tongil hanguk] without 
fail. I pay my respects to the patience and passion [innaesim 
kwa yolchong] of the Russian people who are participating in 
democratic reforms and new economic construction. 
  I firmly believe that the sweat and tears shed today by you 
council members and Russian people for reform will eventually 
bear the fruits of joy and hope. A new, stable, and prosperous 
Russia will be a sign to the Russian people, Asian people, and 
all the people of the world that a new, mutually prosperous era 
has emerged. 
  Next, I would like to stress the need for the ROK and Russia 
to make greater efforts for greater mutual understanding between 
them. The ROK and Russia established modern diplomatic relations 
in the 1880's. For one hundred years since then there was a 
period of friendship and cooperation during which Russia 
assisted our independence movement. On the other hand, our 
history is also marked by bitter discord and severance. 
  While Stalin's rule imposed blood and sufferings on the 
Russian people, it brought the miserable tragedy of war to the 
ROK people. Until ROK-Soviet diplomatic relations were 
established in 1990, the ROK and Russia had to suffer a period 
of dispute characterized by mutual distrust and hostility, as 
evidenced in the shooting down of the Korean Airline plane. We 
should rid ourselves of this unhappy past to open a new era of 
mutual understanding. Any form of mutual cooperation will be 
impossible if we fail to understand one another. I foresee an 
era of mutual understanding and cooperation between the two 
countries bearing its fruit. 
  The documents related to the 25 June Korean war that we have 
received from the Russian Government this time means the 
liquidation of the dark past that existed between the ROK and 
the Soviet Union. 
  The volume of trade, which was $900 million in 1990, 
increased to $1.6 billion last year. The ROK people's investment 
in Russia amounts to $24 million in 15 cases. 
  As of March 1994, 29 prominent ROK business firms 
established 
their branch offices in Russia. 
  With my current visit to Russia as an occasion, practical 
and 
substantive cooperative relations will be further expanded 
rapidly. 
  Supplementary economic cooperation and technological 
cooperation based on mutual needs will make the ROK and Russia 
even closer neighbors. [passage omitted] 
  The change in the position of Koreans living in Russia is an 
important example symbolically showing the change in relations 
between the ROK and Russia. 
  Council members, another task that we should jointly pursue 
is to make Asia a zone of peace free from oppression and war. 
Peace is a long-aspired desire of mankind. However, mankind 
suffered various wars for the past 100 years. In particular, 
east Asia has suffered from the imperialists' war of aggression 
[cheguk chuui ui chimyak chonjaeng] and from the harsh trial of 
the Cold War system during the past century. 
  The Korean peninsula had to confront such a historical trial 
right in the front. The Korean peninsula still remained in the 
state of division. The ROK people and I are making consistent 
efforts to achieve peace and peaceful reunification of the 
Korean peninsula. 
  Among other things, dispelling [haesosikinuniri] the 
international community's suspicion over North Korea's nuclear 
weapons development as quickly as possible is important. 
  This is because peace on the Korean peninsula and, moreover, 
peace in Asia can never be ensured without clearly resolving the 
nuclear issue. In addition, world peace cannot be ensured either. 
  The ROK people and I are fully prepared to give economic 
assistance to North Korea, which is facing a difficult economic 
situation, for its rehabilitation and reforms [chaegongwa 
kaehyogul wihae], only if the nuclear issue is resolved. 
  I sincerely call on Russian parliamentary leaders to 
positively cooperate to resolve this issue. 
  Since I came to office, I planned to visit Russia, the 
United 
States, Japan, and China, the countries that are exerting the 
most important influence over east Asia, and have completed the 
visit to three countries except Russia. I asked the government 
leaders and people of these nations to actively cooperate for 
peace in east Asia, and acquired their support. 
  Now, I am visiting Russia and sincerely discussing the 
measures for peace in east Asia with Russian leaders, including 
President Yeltsin. Without Russia's cooperation, peace in east 
Asia cannot be ensured. This will be the starting point for 
opening a new history of mutual prosperity between the ROK and 
Russia. 
  Cooperation of the Russian Government and parliamentary 
leaders for opening the history of peace will expand peace of 
the entire world. Let us all unite our strength and become the 
main force for opening the era of peace. 
  I have experience in leading my life as a parliamentarian 
for 
over 30 years. Therefore, I have special affection and 
friendship toward you all. [passage omitted] 
  I believe that the Russian people will exert more important 
influence upon mankind's civilization in the 21st Century than 
any other people of the world. This is because the Russian 
people have great cultural assets and capabilities of leading 
the world's civilization in the 21st Century. One of the central 
pillars of new civilization is being formed in the Asian-Pacific 
region. 
  I believe that Russia, together with the ROK, will become 
one 
of the important main forces of the Asian-Pacific era, because 
Russia has the great people with unlimited natural resources and 
boundless potential. The ROK people and I, together with all 
other people of the world, expect for the Russian people's 
creative activities. 
  I believe that politics is a process of realizing justice 
and 
at the same time, a work of linking the people with the future 
hope. I hope that the Russian parliament and your Council, be a 
plaza of consensus of the people toward change and reform, and 
be a beaconfire illuminating dream and hope of the future to the 
Russian people who are going through transitional difficulties. 
  I sincerely hope that the Russian parliament will play the 
key role in creating a new stabilized and prosperous Russia, and 
that the proud days when Russia again takes a great leap for the 
world and for mankind will come at an early date. 
  Let us all unite our strength and make efforts for the new 
long history of mutual prosperity between the ROK and Russia and 
for creation of new civilization of the world in the 21st 
Century. 
  Thank you all. [applause]

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Nikolay Geronin] </F>
  [Excerpts] Moscow, 4 June -- Kim Yong-sam, president of the 
Republic of Korea, today left Moscow for Tashkent at the end of 
the Russian-Korean summit. 
  At Sheremetyevo-1 airport, the leader of the Republic of 
Korea was seen off by Oleg Soskovets, first deputy chairman of 
the Russian government. [passage omitted] 
  After visiting Uzbekistan on 4-6 June, Kim Yong-sam on 7 
June 
will visit Khabarovsk and Vladivostok, where he will meet the 
leadership of Khabarovsk Kray and Primorskiy Kray and will 
inspect a large anti-submarine ship of the Pacific Fleet. 
  "We are very pleased with the results of the Russian-South 
Korean summit," Han Sung-chu, the foreign minister of the 
Republic of Korea, stated to an ITAR-TASS correspondent. "This 
was a major contribution towards the process of broadening and 
strengthening our relations in all spheres -- security, 
diplomacy, economy. In the economic sphere we have not just 
consolidated our existing economic links but opened new doors in 
our bilateral cooperation." 
  It is also very important that both presidents -- Boris 
Yeltsin and Kim Yong-sam -- got on well with each other 
personally, the minister noted. The two presidents have much in 
common: they are both very good politicians, have strong 
leadership qualities and are capable at taking decisive actions. 
  Georgiy Kunadze, the Russian ambassador in Seoul, said that 
the dialogue between the Russian and South Korean presidents was 
fruitful. Boris Yeltsin and Kim Yong-sam had a thorough 
exchange of opinions about relations between the two countries 
which are developing smoothly. Questions of international 
importance, including the North Korean nuclear issue were also 
discussed. The Russian side believes that this problem should 
be solved but at the same time no harsh steps need be taken, the 
ambassador noted.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Aleksandr Kondratyev] </F>
  [Text] Talks have taken place in Moscow between Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin and ROK President Kim Yong-sam. Station 
reporter Aleksandr Kondratyev assesses the results of the ROK- 
Russian high-level talks: 
  The Russian-ROK joint communique is the most important among 
the documents signed as a result of these meetings. The 
communique contains the two leaders' principled view on the 
development of bilateral cooperation and global and regional 
problems. 
  The Russian and ROK presidents declared that they would 
develop their bilateral relations into a constructive and 
reciprocal partnership based on the universal values of freedom, 
democracy, lawfulness, and human rights. 
  I must point out, however, that all the potential to build 
relations between the countries was not utilized. However, as 
President Boris Yeltsin has stated, Russia has every reason to 
be optimistic about the prospects of relations between Russia 
and the ROK. President Yeltsin described the bilateral 
relations as constructive, good-neighborly relations. 
  Kim yong-sam stated that his visit to Moscow and the talks 
during the visit will make relations between Russia and the ROK 
friendlier. 
  The presidents of the two countries paid particular 
attention 
to the situation on the Korean peninsula and, in particular, the 
Korean nuclear crisis. This is very appropriate. This is 
because it has been said that nuclear weapons may appear on the 
Korean peninsula. 
  The joint communique stresses that any attempt to produce 
nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula would seriously threaten 
security in Northeast Asia and the world. 
  Boris Yeltsin said that Russia is very much worried about 
the 
unresolved nuclear issue in this region and insists that the 
DPRK remain a complete signatory to the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty and completely fulfill its commitment on the safeguards 
accord which it had signed with the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA]. 
  The ROK president supported Moscow's initiative on convening 
a multinational conference on achieving security and 
establishing a nuclear-free region on the Korean peninsula. 
  The Russian president thinks that unless a decision is made 
on convening this conference, it will be too early to talk about 
sanctions against North Korea. He pointed out the issue of 
imposing sanctions against Pyongyang may be raised only when the 
DPRK tries to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
  Generally speaking, the two presidents highly assessed the 
high- level talks in Moscow.

  [Text] Moscow hopes that in Istanbul next Friday NATO 
foreign ministers will give their reply to Russia's proposals 
concerning the practical implementation of the Partnership For 
Peace program. Interfax learned this today from Yuriy Ushakov, 
the director of the European Cooperation Department of Russia's 
Foreign Ministry. 
  The North-Atlantic Council for Cooperation will hold its 
routine session on the level of foreign ministers in Istanbul 
next Friday and Saturday. The session will be attended by the 
head of Russian diplomacy, Andrey Kozyrev. On Thursday the 
foreign ministers of NATO countries will have a conference there. 
  As Ushakov said, "Russia stands for strengthening the 
Council 
and for gradually transforming it into an independent agency for 
multilateral politico-military consultations connected with the 
CSCE." 
  According to him, at the session of the Council the foreign 
ministers will adopt a joint statement reflecting their attitude 
to the pressing issues of European and world politics. 
  In Istanbul we'll underscore our willingness to promptly 
begin to work out the possible agreement between Russia and NATO 
on the basis of suggestions [as received] Russia's Defence 
Minister, Pavel Grachev, outlined in Brussels on May 25," 
Ushakov said.

  [Text] Moscow, 3 June -- Moscow is concerned about the 
latest outbreak of military actions in the zone adjacent to the 
Lebanese-Israeli frontier, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said 
here today. 
  He said that as a result of an Israeli aviation attack on a 
Hizballah base, there were many Lebanese casualties, and the 
territorial sovereignty of Lebanon had been violated. In turn, 
areas in northern Israel were subjected to dangerous fire. 
  "These alarming events cast a shadow over the continuation 
of 
Arab-Israeli dialogue and reconfirm the need for stepping up the 
comprehensive search for political solutions," the statement by 
the repesentative of the Russian diplomatic department said. 
"Only at the negotiating table can and should agreements be 
reached guaranteeing both the restoration of the territorial 
integrity of Lebanon and the mutual security of this state and 
Israel, and guaranteeing that there is no dangerous escalation 
of violence." 
  As co-sponsor of the Near East peace process, Russia calls 
upon all sides "to display maximum restraint and common sense 
and to be guided in their actions by the long-term interests of 
establishing a stable and just peace in the region."

<F P=106> [Vladimir Skosyrev report: "Three Minutes' Silence on </F>
Tienanmen Square. Five Years Ago Chinese Students Challenged 
the Party. And the Party Gave the Command: `Fire'"] 
  [Excerpts] Beijing -- No posters, rallies, or speeches. 
There must be no breach of the bans. At exactly 1200 hours on 4 
June people will stand in silence for three minutes. That will 
be the most fitting means of honoring the memory of those who 
died on Tienanmen Square. [passage omitted] 
  Memories of the bloody internal strife are still alive. The 
Chinese have before their eyes another frightening image -- the 
disintegrating USSR. References to the unsuccessful "Russian 
model" figure frequently in secret publications destined for 
career party officials and also in statements by pro-Beijing 
politicians in Hong Kong. For instance, one such politician, 
Chu Youling, claims that, had it not proved possible to put down 
the troublemakers on Tienanmen Square, China would have suffered 
Russia's fate. 
  "I realized that the speeches on Tienanmen Square were the 
fruit of student fervor and not of mature analysis," I was told 
by a young entrepreneur who five years ago was working as a 
reporter and was delighted to heed the calls to establish 
democracy in China. Since then he has changed dramatically, gone 
into business, and continually goes abroad. In his opinion, 
Deng Xiaoping's reforms, socialist in name but capitalist in 
essence, open up unlimited oportunities for the private sector 
to make money. 
  Whereas, before, university graduates went to work where 
they 
were assigned, now many people can choose for themselves 
well-paid jobs in joint enterprises or foreign firms. During 
meetings with foreign journalists these young people reiterate 
in the wake of official propaganda that the right to material 
prosperity is more important than all other human rights. 
  Nonetheless, the lessons of 1989 have not disappeared 
without 
trace. They primarily gave a huge number of people an 
opportunity to see the Communist Party in its true colors and 
showed that it is willing to spill blood when its monopoly on 
power is at stake. Second, the dissidents say, the glaring 
contradiction between liberal reforms in the economy and the 
preservation of the totalitarian political regime has become 
particularly obvious against the backdrop of those events. 
  People see corruption and are indignant that party mandarins 
in the localities are exploiting their absolute power and 
filling their pockets at the treasury's expense. 
  In the events of 1989 workers played a secondary role and 
peasants played none at all. Today they are less and less like 
an inert mass. Bribery and corruption among officials and 
conflicts over land are arousing peasant unrest in the 
provinces. Although overt forms of protest are prohibited by 
law, last year, according to the Ministry of Labor, there were 
6,000 strikes and demonstrations by workers. 
  In the opinion of Xu Lianing, a 70-year old scientist who 
openly declares his differences with the government, social 
contradictions today are more acute than in 1989. If a slump 
begins in the economy, as happened in the late eighties, or 
overt struggle flares up in the party following Deng Xiaoping's 
retirement, renewed upheaval cannot be ruled out. There is no 
democratic mechanism in the country to ensure a smooth transfer 
of power.

  [Text] Moscow June 3 TASS -- A spokesman for the Russian 
Foreign ministry protested today against anti-Russian statements 
of the Turkish military chief. 
  Turkish media recently cited Gueres as saying that Russia is 
an even bigger threat to Turkey now than it was during the cold 
war. The general accused Moscow of expansionist desires in 
relation to the Caucasus region, Ukraine, and even the Balkan 
states. 
  Such statements "fundamentally contradict the agreement 
reached between the Russian and Turkish higher leadership that 
their relations have entered a new level of friendly 
partnership", the spokesman said on Friday. 
  He mentioned the many announcements made by Turkish 
President 
Suleyman Demirel, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, and other Turkish 
leaders, which expressed satisfaction that Russian-Turkish 
relations have entered a new era and are now based on mutual 
interests and the spirit of cooperation. 
  "The Russian side would like to hope that the statements 
made 
by Gueres do not reflect the point of view of Turkey's political 
leadership, and Russia bases its policy on the assumption that 
Ankara is just as interested as Moscow is in the further 
development of Russian-Turkish relations and multilateral 
cooperation", the Foreign Ministry spokesman declared.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Nikita Yermakov] </F>
  [Text] Paris, 4 Jun -- An accord was reached here today 
with representatives of the `Paris Club' of creditor states on 
rescheduling Russia's payment of $7 billion on its external 
debts this year. 
  Sergey Dubinin, Russia's acting minister of finances, said 
at 
a meeting with correspondents that the talks went on for two 
days and two nights, and ended this morning with the signing of 
an appropriate agreement. The rescheduling concerns the part of 
the basic capital and the interest on it that Russia was to have 
repaid this year. The $7 billion on which the accord was 
reached will be paid back later. 
  Russia has achieved advantageous conditions for the 
rescheduling of this part of the debt. The `Paris Club' has 
granted a 3-year grace period, during which no demand will be 
made for the money and after which the sum will be repaid over 
17 years. A favorable interest rate will be charged on this 
part of the consolidated debt. 
  The head of the Russian delegation drew attention in 
particular to the fact that the agreement with the `Paris Club' 
opens the way to agreement with other creditors. Corresponding 
talks are to be held with the commercial banks, suppliers, and 
private banks which make up the `London Club.' As a rule, 
agreements are concluded with these crditors on conditions 
comparable to the conditions of the `Paris Club.' In total, it 
is a matter of a sum amounting to approximately $25-27 billion. 
  Last year an accord was reached with the `Paris Club' on 
rescheduling payments on Russian external debts amounting to $15 
billion, due in 1993. Sergey Dubinin stressed that Russia's 
fulfilment of the obligations it had undertaken on this 
agreement are inspiring trust in creditors who also understand 
Russia's economic difficulties and the efforts of its government 
to reduce inflation rates. 
  The total debt inherited by Russia from the the former 
Soviet 
Union amounts to $78-84 billion. The acting finance minister 
stressed that the servicing of debts taken on directly by the 
Russian Government since 1 January 1992 is on schedule. For the 
time being the draft state budget for the current year, which is 
being discussed by parliament, allocates $4.1 billion to debt 
repayment. Russia will realistically be able to pay its 
creditors after talks with them within the framework established 
by the law. 
  He said talks would take place in the fall on a general 
restructuring and consolidation of Russia's total external debt 
and on rescheduling forthcoming payments. To do this it is 
necessary to reach agreement on Russia's economic policy with 
experts of the International Monetary Fund. Afterward, the 
creditors will be able to hold talks on rescheduling the 
payments, as a result of which foreign debts will cease to 
pressurize the Russian economy. 
  Replying to a question by an ITAR-TASS correspondent, Sergey 
Dubinin stressed that Russia attaches great significance to 
participation in the upcoming meeting in Naples of the `G-7'. 
We are expecting all its participants to confirm the policy of 
cooperation with Russia as defined last year in Tokyo, he said. 
No dramatic turns in this policy are proposed, he said, 
although a change in accent is possible in connection with the 
development of events in Russia. He noted the particular 
importance of attracting direct foreign investments to Russia 
which, alongside Russian capital investments, guarantee a way 
out of the crisis.

  [Text] Moscow June 5 -- A government delegation led by 
First Vice-Premier Oleg Soskovets will fly to Malaysia for a 
two-day visit this afternoon. The main event of the coming trip 
is the signing of a contract on June 7 to sell Malaysia 18 
Russian MiG-29 fighters. 
  The Russian delegation will discuss a package of bilateral 
economic issues with Malaysian Premier Mahathir Mohamed and his 
cabinet members in the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur. It is 
also planned that the delegation will be received by the 
Malaysian supreme head of state. 
  ITAR-TASS learnt at the Russian Government's office that the 
above-mentioned contract has been agreed upon. It is worth 615 
million U.S. dollars. According to Malaysian representatives, 
20- 25 per cent of the sum will be paid with palm oil, necessary 
for various industries. 
  The first fighter will be delivered next April. The 
implementation of the entire project is planned for a 25-year 
period and provides for creating infrastructure in Malaysia, 
necessary for the operation of MiG fighters. 
  The two countries plan to build in Malaysia a technical 
centre to service aircraft.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Pasyakin report featuring interview with Admiral </F>
Gromov, commander in chief of the Russian Navy; date not given: 
"We Are Dividing Up the Black Sea Fleet Piecemeal. Groups of 
Russian and Ukrainian Military Experts Are at Work in 
Sevastopol"] 
  [Text] Sevastopol -- Our correspondent met with Admiral 
Feliks Gromov, commander in chief of the Russian Navy, the head 
of the Russian experts. 
  [Gromov] The group of experts is involved in assessing the 
status of the fleet's forces, primarily the seagoing hardware 
[plavsredstva] which is to be divided up. The parameters for 
this division are being determined and a list is being drawn up 
of names of the ships and vessels that will go, in time, to the 
Russian Fleet and to the Ukrainian Navy. It is a painstaking 
job. It is necessary to look into every ship, every piece of 
hardware. The groups' experts have different viewpoints on some 
issues. And it is by no means simple to find a common language. 
But we are acting on the basis of the official accords that 
have already been secured during the previous meetings of the 
heads of state and defense ministers. No new accords are 
envisaged. The status of the ship "pool" is being assessed. 
  [Pasyakin] Feliks Nikolayevich, there was a report that the 
Russian and Ukrainian delegations would be led by Yuriy Dubinin, 
Russian Foreign Ministry ambassador at large, and Ukrainian Vice 
Premier Valeriy Shmarov. However, they have not come. Why? 
  [Gromov] There was no full accord to the effect that the 
delegations would comprise precisely these members. There was 
an accord regarding the work of the groups of experts. I came 
in order to direct the Russian group. As for Valeriy 
Nikolayevich Shmarov, as a representative of the Ukrainian 
government he has expressed a desire to familiarize himself with 
certain fleet installations that may go to the Ukrainian side. 
We considered this normal and possible. If he comes to the 
fleet and wants to familiarize himself with certain facilities, 
we will show them to him. 
  [Pasyakin] The officers, ensigns, and employees of the 
Crimean Naval Base sent an open letter to you. It asked you not 
to allow it to be handed over to the Ukrainian naval forces. 
"If that happens," the letter says, "over 7,000 officers and 
ensigns and family members will be left without the means of 
existence and will be forced to leave their homes." What do you 
think of that? 
  [Gromov] I understand people's concern and disquiet, the 
position in which they find themselves. Where possible we will 
take this request into consideration. But I think that this 
letter is somewhat premature. Why? Because the division of a 
fleet is a lengthy process. And it does not mean that if some 
decision is adopted today, say, it will be implemented tomorrow. 
But the main thing that we will strive to do is not to harm 
people, not to harm the fleet and its combat capability.... 
[Gromov ends] 
  Before my meeting with the commander in chief of the Russian 
Navy I asked Rear Admiral Aleksey Ryzhenko, first deputy 
commander and chief of staff of the Ukrainian Navy, how the 
joint work of the Russian and Ukrainian military experts was 
going. 
  "We will follow the list of ships and vessels and divide 
them 
up fifty-fifty; then the Ukrainian side will sell Russia a 
number previously agreed. The groups of experts are expected to 
be at work for around a week." 
  A Ukrainian delegation led by Boris Tarasyuk, who is, as we 
know, conducting the talks with the Russian side, arrived in 
Sevastopol 3 June. The delegation included Ukrainian Vice 
Premier Valeriy Shmarov and Colonel General Ivan Bizhan, 
Ukrainian first deputy defense minister. The Ukrainian 
delegation had a meeting with Adm. Feliks Gromov, commander in 
chief of the Russian Navy. Yuriy Dubinin has not arrived in 
Sevastopol. The delegations look unequal. The talks seem to 
have become deadlocked. 
  Needless to say, we should not expect a rapid practical 
solution to the question of the division of the Black Sea Fleet. 
Ukraine benefits from that, since Russia is effectively 
maintaining the entire fleet on its own and thus the Ukrainian 
part of it as well. Moreover certain politicians are in no hurry 
to close the question of the Black Sea Fleet, since they have by 
no means "squeezed" all the possible political "dividends" from 
it. The men are being patient. But this patience is not 
infinite. Do the politicians realize that?

<F P=106> [Report by Nerdun Hacioglu: "Russia Moves Silently and </F>
Effectively on the Karabakh Dispute"] 
  [Text] Russia is silently moving to put into effect its 
peace plan on the Daghlyk Karabakh dispute, a plan that has 
created a very difficult situation for the Aliyev government in 
Azerbaijan. Vladimir Kazimirov, President Boris Yeltsin's 
special envoy, has said that the initiative Russia has launched 
to resolve the Karabakh dispute has not ended and that the talks 
on the matter are being maintained without publicity. 
  In an exclusive statement to HURRIYET, Kazimirov disclosed 
the most recent diplomatic initiatives on Daghlyk Karabakh. 
Stressing that the peace plan for Karabakh, which the sides 
failed to sign at the last moment after putting forward several 
reservations two weeks ago, is still on the agenda, Kazimirov 
asserted: "Compared with the crisis in Bosnia, the dispute on 
Karabakh is an older problem and has deeper roots. We are 
maintaining our initiatives. However, we do not expect to find 
a quick solution." 
<H5>  Contacts With Aliyev </H5>
  Kazimirov stressed that he confers with President Geydar 
Aliyev and President Levon Ter-Petrosyan by telephone every day. 
He noted: "Russia's peace proposals will be accepted sooner or 
later. No other way exists to resolve the dispute. The 
Armenian and the Azerbaijani officials urge Russia to support 
them. However, complying with their requests is impossible. 
Considering the occupation of a part of Azerbaijan's territory, 
Turkey may view the matter in a different way. However, as far 
as we are concerned, no side can win or lose in the war on 
Karabakh. Both sides have to make significant concessions for 
the solution of the problem. The peace plan will be successful 
when they become mature enough to agree to make concessions." 
<H5>  Turkey Must Not Worry </H5>
  Referring to the Russia's intention to deploy its 
peacekeeping forces in the region, Kazimirov said that Turkey 
must not be worried by Moscow's approach. He asserted: "We 
have been proposing the deployment of peacekeeping forces for 
the past year. Russia is the only country that has agreed to 
deploy troops in that region without delay. No other CSCE 
country has agreed to do so. It is true that Turkey has offered 
to send troops. However, Armenia has objected to that proposal. 
We should not be blamed for that. The deployment of the 
Turkish military units would have facilitated our work. 
Considering all that, I want to suggest that Turkey must not be 
worried by the idea that Russia will occupy Karabakh by 
deploying its troops in that region. 
  Recalling that Turkey refrained from adopting a negative 
approach on Russia's latest proposals for peace, Kazimirov said: 
"I am aware of the message President Suleyman Demirel has 
conveyed to President Boris Yeltsin on the Karabakh dispute. 
The message was received two months ago. I have recently held 
talks with the Turkish ambassador in Moscow. We were not 
informed of Ankara's official objection on the Karabakh dispute." 
<H5>  Why Involve Military Forces? </H5>
  Kazimirov explained why a prominent role has been given to 
the generals in the peace talks, particularly to Defense 
Minister Pavel Grachev. He said: "The first stage of the peace 
plan includes several military issues. The separation of the 
warring sides, deployment of observers, and adoption of measures 
against the side that violates the cease-fire are military 
matters. That is why Grachev should be on the scene. 
Naturally, the diplomats will take over when the first stage of 
the plan is realized." 
<H5>  The Aliyev-Ter-Petrosyan Summit </H5>
  Kazimirov said that an effort is being made for a meeting 
between President Aliyev and President Ter-Petrosyan to sign the 
agreement which has been drawn up by the defense ministers of 
the three sides. He asserted: "Predicting the exact date of 
that summit is impossible. However, we believe that the silence 
on the matter will be broken and the Armenian and Azerbaijani 
leaders will hold a summit soon."

  [Text] Russian president's envoy on the matters associated 
with the settlement in Nagorno Karabakh, Vladimir Kazimirov, 
left on Saturday night Baku for Yerevan where he will continue 
the talks he started in the Azeri capital on the materialization 
of the Russian plan for settlement of the Armenian-Azeri 
conflict. 
  It's a matter of removing obstacles on the way for the 
signing of a military-technical protocol and a larger political 
agreement, said Kazimirov in an interview to Interfax in Baku. 
  He believes that each side of the conflict has its own 
proposals for the Russian settlement plan and now it is 
necessary to draw closer the positions. Kazimirov said that 
Baku urges for the earliest withdrawal of the Armenian forces 
from the Azeri territories they occupied. For its part, the 
Armenian side insists on the beginning of the negotiations on 
the status of Nagorno Karabakh. 
  Kazimirov is expected to return to Baku from Yerevan. 
  The three-stage plan for the settlement of the Karabakh 
conflict envisages the establishment of a lasting ceasefire, the 
withdrawal of the troops from the occupied territories, the 
exchange of POWs, hostages, the remains of the killed, the 
resumption of operation of transport and energy communications, 
the return of the refugees and political talks on the future 
legal status of Nagorno Karabakh.

  [Text] The following scandalous statement came from Tbilisi 
today: 
  [Correspondent] The transfer of Russian peacekeeping forces 
to take up stations in the Abkhazian conflict zone began today. 
Journalists were told this by the head of the Georgian 
delegation at the Abkhazian-Georgian talks, Dzhaba Ioseliani. 
He stressed the leadership of the Georgian Defense Ministry, 
and in particular the first deputy Russian Defense Minister 
[Colonel-General Georgiy] Kondratyev, guarantee the complete 
safety of refugees returning to Abkhazia. He also noted that 
Russian peace-keeping forces will be active observers of the 
ongoing processes and will actively participate in them. They 
are very resolute and will take the appropriate measures against 
any forces which try to disrupt the agreement achieved. 
  [Announcer] The statement by Dzhaba Ioseliani on the 
introduction of Russian troops to the conflict zone was 
commented on by Petr Shirshov, chairman of the Russian 
Federation Council's Defense Committee, at the request of our 
radio station. 
  [Begin Shirshov recording] Unfortunately I did not hear Mr. 
Shevardnadze's official statement and statements by other 
officials of the soveriegn state of Georgia. Nevertheless I do 
not understand, if this is actually true that the introduction 
of troops between the sides in conflict, between Georgia and 
Abkhazia, has begun today, then this violates the constitution 
of the Russian Federation, no matter who made the decision, no 
matter which top Russian officials. 
  I want to stress that Article 102 of the Constitution, Part 
4, Point G, says that the agreement to the introduction of 
Russian Armed Forces outside the Russian state can be given only 
by the Federation Council. [end recording]

  [Text] In relations between Russia and Kazakhstan there is 
a "gap" between the degree of mutual understanding on the 
highest level and its practical implementation, said Russia's 
Foreign Minister, Andrey Kozyrev, at talks with his Kazakh 
counterpart, Kanat Saudabayev, in Moscow on Friday. 
  He said "when practical work begins, even the existing 
agreements, let alone the notion of a Eurasian union, fail to 
work well." 
  "Back in January we submitted to Kazakhstan our ideas 
concerning citizenship, but received a reply only yesterday, 
that is six months later. The two presidents must evidently 
punish us for this," Kozyrev said. 
  There are also other problems requiring solutions, such as 
the issues of the Baykonur launch site and missile silos. 
"Can't we resolve them without third parties?" he asked. 
  When the talks ended, Kozyrev's political adviser Galina 
Sidorova told journalists that Kozyrev and Saudabayev had 
focused on ways to bridge the "gap" mentioned by the Russian 
foreign minister, and translate the existing agreements into 
practical deeds. 
  Sidorova said the two sides had formed a joint working group 
which will engage in drafting documents that would develop 
bilateral agreements reached on the highest level. 
  During the recent visit to Moscow of President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev the two sides signed on twenty agreements, including 
a treaty on furthering economic cooperation, accords on military 
cooperation, an agreement on the use and lease of the Baykonur 
launch site, and a memorandum on the basic principles of 
resolving problems connected with citizenship and with the legal 
status of Russian and Kazakh citizens, she said. 
  On the eve of talks between Kozyrev and Saudabayev 
Kazakhstan 
submitted to Moscow a draft agreement on the legal status of 
citizens, Sidorova pointed out. "Russia is particularly 
concerned over this issue. It stands for a unified and 
indivisible Kazakhstan, but it would like the Kazakh leaders to 
find a common language with their Russian-speaking population 
which numbers millions," she stressed. 
  Sidorova said Kazakhstan also submitted a draft agreement on 
simplifying the procedure of acquiring citizenship, on the order 
of military service and on cooperation in the field of labor 
migration. "These agreements directly concern the problem of 
human rights. We hope that they will help ease our mutual 
concern and dissatisfaction caused by the fact that 
understandings reached on the highest level are not carried out 
quickly and effectively enough," she said.

  [Text] The situation in the state of emergency zone will 
never stabilize if the Interim Administration on Ingush and 
South Ossetian territory and Vladikavkaz ignore the decree on 
the return of deported Ingush to their places of permanent 
residence issued by the Russian president. This was stated by 
Ingush President Ruslan Aushev at a press conference in Nazran 
today. The press conference was held on the decision of the 
Russian Federation Council which had confirmed the presidential 
decree on extending the state of emergency in the zone of the 
inter-ethnic conflict until July 31. 
  Aushev said that the return of Ingush refugees would depend 
on how efficiently the Interim Administration headed by Vladimir 
Lozovoy would perform.

  [Text] Vladikavkaz June 5 TASS -- In recent days, the 
situation has become relatively stable in the part of North 
Ossetia where state of emergency rule was extended for another 
two months, from May 31 to July 31. According to military 
sources, no conflicts on ethnic grounds broke out in the zone 
over the past twenty-four hours. Russian peacekeeping troops, 
in close coordination with local law-enforcement bodies, are 
overseeing the state of emergency rule. 
  Officials of federal ministries and agencies continue 
working 
in the region, a spokesman for the North Ossetian president and 
government told TASS on Sunday. They examine the situation in 
the conflict zone and address issues of housing, communications, 
economic facilities in North Ossetia's Prigorodny District, the 
hotbed of the armed conflict. 
  North Ossetian mass media gave on Sunday wide comments on 
the 
statement by the republic's President Akhsarbek Galazov, saying 
the North Ossetian leadership is ready to comply with the 
Russian president's decree on the return of refugees to places 
of their permanent residence. However, the problem of refugees 
should be solved in complex, on the basis of documents signed in 
Kislovodsk. The final word is to be said here by commissions of 
conciliation.

  [Text] The program for the return of refugees to their 
homelands will be signed by both the North Ossetian and the 
Ingush sides. A RIA correspondent has learned this from 
Aleksandr Chelyshev, deputy minister of civil defense, 
emergencies, and natural disasters. He also revealed that 
around 40-45 billion rubles will be needed to restore housing in 
North Ossetia's Prigorodnyy Rayon. Part of this sum has already 
been received in the region and will be used toward the

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Refugee? Get Running!"] </F>
  [Text] In Moscow and Moscow Oblast the militia have 
started "hunting" refugees from countries of the near abroad and 
certain Arab regions. Organs, following a decree from the 
Moscow City Government, are to locate citizens in this category 
and unambiguously "request" that they leave Moscow Oblast. 
  There are currently 6,000 refugees (it is thought) in the 
city. Not one of them is registered, since there is no relevant 
legislation covering this. These people are not even entitled 
to look for work or seek hospital treatment. Consequently, they 
are often forced into crime in order to earn money for food. 
  Incidentally, the other day the Russian Federation 
president's Human Rights Commission prepared a report, which 
nobody has as yet examined, on the need to grant automatic 
Russian citizenship to any refugee who requests it.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel Network in Russian at 1700 GMT on 4 June 1994 broadcasts 
the "Novosti" newscast with correspondent Sergey Medvedev 
introducing an interview recorded today with Russian Deputy 
Prime Minister Sergey Shakhray. Medvedev questions Shakhray on 
Moscow's relations with the regions, particularly Tatarstan and 
Chechnya. 
  Commenting on the significance of Boris Yeltsin's visit to 
Tatarstan earlier this week, Shakhray says: "The Russian 
president's visit to Tatarstan was not only to solve economic 
problems but also to check the way in which the treaty on the 
delimitation of competences and authorities was being 
implemented. In essence it was a demonstration of the fact that 
the method developed for tackling regional conflicts has 
importance outside Russia as well, because this visit took place 
against the background of the crisis between Kiev and 
Simferopol, the Crimean problem." 
  He continues: "I personally believe that taking account of 
Ukraine's specific features, of the fact that it is a unitary 
state, the method that was used to tackle that regional crisis 
is suitable for the Ukrainian situation. It is suitable for the 
Dniester Republic, and for Karabakh, but it is most clearly 
suitable for tackling the Crimean problem. 
  "Three years ago, relations between Moscow and Kazan were 
almost identical to those that have developed between Kiev and 
Simferopol. There were shows of force; there were decisions by 
the Supreme Soviets annulling each other's resolutions; there 
was a decision by the Constitutional Court; and there was a 
referendum. We had enough self-possession and commonsense to 
avoid a scenario involving force, and to find a proper and 
civilized scheme for solving the problem. One was found, taking 
account of reciprocal interests, involving compromise, talks, 
and the delimitation of authorities." 
  Asked about relations between Moscow and Chechnya, Shakhray 
says that politicians both in Russia and in Chechnya are now 
looking for a way out of difficult economic situations: "I 
would say there are two points that one ought to concentrate on. 
They are the coordinated fight against crime and the tackling 
of economic problems. This is the way toward a general easing 
of the situation and toward a draft treaty on the division of 
competences and powers." 
  Medvedev then asks Shakhray whether Ruslan Khasbulatov could 
come back to Russian politics as a deputy from Chechnya. 
Shakhray says that at the moment there is a conflict between 
Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev and Ruslan Khasbulatov. 
Shakhray continues: "I have to think of a situation whereby 
Khasbulatov and Dudayev reach agreement between themselves. In 
essence, they can agree that Dudayev concludes an economic 
agreement or a treaty with Russia and holds elections to the 
Federation Council. If Khasbulatov stands as a candidate for 
these elections -- although he might discard politics altogether 
-- but if he stands as a candidate one might suppose that he can 
be elected during the elections. Then the republic will remain 
under Dudayev's leadership. Khasbulatov will then move from the 
republic to the Federation Council. This is not science 
fiction, this is a political combination, a political option 
that politicians both in Groznyy and in Moscow have to think 
about."

<F P=106> [Report by R. Rashitov: "Defense Industry Problems at the </F>
Center of Attention"] 
  [Text] Topical questions regarding joint measures for 
stabilization of the situation at defense industry enterprises, 
worked out by the Governments of the Russian Federation and 
Republic of Tatarstan, were discussed during the consultations 
held in Kazan by O.N. Soskovets, first deputy chairman of the 
Government of Russia, and Tatarstan Prime Minister M.G. Sabirov. 
  The participants in the consultations--directors of a number 
of military-industrial complex large industrial 
enterprises--discussed the problems of preservation and 
improvement of the defense industry's scientific and 
technological potential, and speeding up the production of 
civilian goods at these enterprises that would be both 
competitive and affordable for the population. 
  An agreement was reached to provide conversion credits, tax 
preferences, placing long-term orders, and gradual transfer of 
housing and social-cultural facilities into the ownership of, 
and maintenance by, local bodies of executive authority. It was 
pointed out to defense industry enterprise directors that they 
have to boost their commercial activities aimed at selling the 
products they produce, including exporting them. 
  O.N. Soskovets and M.G. Sabirov visited production shops and 
sections of aviation and motor-building production associations, 
where they were shown samples of output, and talked to workers 
and technical-engineering personnel.

  [Text] Samara, June 6 TASS -- Oleg Sysuyev has been elected 
the mayor of Samara, a major industrial centre on the Volga, in 
the first popular municipal elections of this kind on Sunday. 
Seventy-three per cent of the voters cast their ballots in his 
favour. Sysuyev's closest rival scored ten times fewer votes. 
  Sysuyev was appointed the head of administration of Samara 
by 
Yeltsin's decree two years ago, the Sunday elections gave him 
popular support needed for further work. 
  Although the economic situation of Samara has never been as 
complex as lately, none of the municipal development programmes 
has been aborted under Oleg Sysuyev. The city transport network 
has been renewed and three new underground stations have been 
added to the underground railway system. Housing has been built 
apace, and many hospitals and educational establishments have 
received new equipment. 
  The mayor of Samara pins great hopes on the development of 
partnership relations with the German city of Stuttgart, 
American St. Louis and Bulgarian Stara Zagora. Exchange of 
experience has already involved scientists, doctors, teachers 
and policemen and is likely to do good to the partner cities and 
will help the nations establish better contacts.

  [Text] Izhevsk June 6 TASS -- The idea of setting up a 
federal military-industrial centre in Izhevsk was approved by 
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, Aleksandr Volkov, 
head of the Udmurtia Government, said at a meeting today with 
the directors of the republic's largest industrial enterprises. 
The centre's main aim is to preserve scientific, technical, 
personnel and production potential. 
  Udmurtia has a good base for the creation of the centre, it 
was said at the meeting. Factories producing arms and means of 
communications can take the functions of this prestigious body 
upon themselves. The Izhevsk Technical Univerity and the 
Technological Scientific Research Institute "Progress" are 
successfully training personell for the centre. 
  According to the idea's authors, besides defence production 
factories, the federal centre should include structures selling 
military supplies. Enterprise directors emphasised that, in 
order to make the whole complex work on a stable basis, it must 
receive stable military orders with guaranteed payment, 
concessional customs duties on the sale of arms abroad, and a 
temporary exemption from paying exorbitant taxes. The 
enterprises' board of directors also submitted to the government 
a draft, envisaging an investment tax credit to Udmurtia's 
converted enterprises. The credit would be made to the federal 
budget, and would have to be paid back by the enterprises.

  [Text] A Novosibirsk couple have ended up on the operating 
table as a result of a grenade thrown through their apartment 
window on the night of 31 May. The injured couple are widely 
known in the city: Yekaterina Zhabotinskaya is head of the 
Central Bank of Russia's chief branch in Novosibirsk Oblast. 
Vladimir Zhabotinskiy is deputy director of a firm. According 
to information from the hospital, both sustained multiple 
wounds. Following operations, there are no fears for their lives. 
  Criminal proceedings have been instituted and an 
investigation is under way. 
  This attempt continues the chain of crimes connected with 
leaders of the local branch of the Central Bank. Its former 
chief, Vasiliy Cheplakov, has twice found himself in the 
criminals' "sights." He was doused with acid, then shot, but 
luckily the bullet missed. 
  "I know full well that I will be the criminals' next victim, 
because I am not convenient for a lot of people," Nikolay 
Beloslyudtsev, deputy chief of the Central Bank branch, said in 
an interview with ITAR-TASS. He expressed strong indignation 
over the fact that the two attempts on Cheplakov's life remain 
unsolved. In his opinion, "the law-enforcement organs are 
dozing."

  [Text] Moscow June 6 TASS -- "The off-shore zone in 
Kalmykia is becoming a reality", declared Kalmyk President 
Kirsan Ilyumzhinov in an interview with BUSINESS-TASS on Monday. 
  The Republic of Kalmykia, possessing lots of potential 
resources, is now facing the problem of attracting foreign 
investment, the president said. It was decided to make the 
creation of an off-shore zone on the republic's territory the 
center-piece of its investment programme. 
  The first step in the realization of this goal was the 
Kalmyk 
president's decree lowering the republic's tax rates on profit. 
The advantageous rates will be available for those enterprises 
and businesses which do not use local raw material and financial 
resources and which attract outside investment into the 
republic. Tax breaks are also planned for banks, insurance 
companies, and enterprises, whose capital is 100 per cent 
foreign. 
  This policy brought immediate returns. There are now many 
foreign companies, some of them quite large, who are applying to 
the Kalmykia mission in Moscow for permission to work in the 
off-shore zone. A branch of the republic's registration chamber 
has opened in the mission to deal with the applications. There 
are already about 100 foreign companies and firms working in 
Kalmykia. 
  Some of the most attractive aspects of the off-shore zone in 
Kalmykia are the republic's political stability, the low crime 
rate, and the absence of mafia structures. 
  Ilyumzhinov specially stressed that the off-shore zone in 
Kalmykia follows the principle of "environmental economy". This 
principle declares that all joint projects with the use of 
Russian or foreign capital are carried out only after a strict 
assessment of their environmental impact. "I am sure that the 
off-shore zone will show its first real results in two years", 
the president declared.

  [Text] A reception was arranged in Yekaterinburg the other 
day for the opening of an LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia] headquarters in the city. According to LDPR Urals 
coordinator Vyacheslav Senko, the local organization numbers 
around 500 Zhirinovskiyites up and down the Urals. At the

a scientific research laboratory to study anomalous phenomena. 
True enough, under Mr. Zhirinovskiy's instructions, the party's 
membership and the presence of money in the party till cannot be 
divulged. But journalists have managed to find out that 
"himself" is planning a visit to Yekaterinburg in June. 
  After power ends up in the hands of Vladimir Volfovich

headquarters, 30 seats in the State Duma would be made available 
to the Urals organization. In the meantime, the local 
organization of the Zhirinovskiy party sets itself the task of 
organizing a massive admission of new members into its ranks, 
and to start its own "URALS" newspaper.

  [Text] Sytyvkar June 3 TASS -- Chairman of the Executive 
Committee of Russia's Communist Party Gennadiy Zyuganov told a 
press-conference on Thursday that he was satisfied with the 
results of his just-concluded four-day trip in the Komi 
republic. Zyuganov, a State Duma member, held many meetings 
with workers in Sytykvar, Vorkuta, and Ukhta. Everywhere he 
went, he said, he was met with warmth and attention. 
  Zyuganov said that he had noticed "a shift to the left" in 
the Komi republic and Russia as a whole, which is attributable 
to the harsh realities of life today. He said he had expected a 
cold reception by the miners in Vorkuta, who have been famous 
for their support for Boris Yeltsin. However, his apprehensions 
proved to be unfounded, and he was also met "kindly" there.

felt that his party had good potential for growth in the polar 
town, which has so far given rise to only 100 members of the 
Communist Party. There are about 1100 official communists in 
the whole republic of Komi. 
  Zyuganov considered the most important reason for the shift 
in the attitude of the Vorkuta workers to be their current 
living conditions, which he said determine one's consciousness. 
"The miners understood that they had been deceived and deceived 
badly. In every respect, miners today are in a worse position 
than they were earlier. Zyuganov mentioned noticing a shift to 
the left in the attitude of Vorkuta residents as well. 
  At all his meetings, Zyuganov appealed for a wide coalition 
of "state-patriotic forces" and for accord in the name of 
Russia. After the union of all the patriotic forces, the 
opposition "can and should change the power and the state system 
in the country in a constitutional way", he said. Possibilities 
for such action are appearing, since society in general is being 
"enlightened, although, unfortunately, slower than the country 
is being destroyed", the communist leader declared.

  [Text] Petrozavodsk, 4 Jun -- The head of the Karelian 
government, Viktor Stepanov, has issued an instruction halting 
the privatization in Karelia of buildings and installations that 
are the republic's state property. Leasing them out has also 
been banned. 
  These measures are temporary, the document says. They have 
been taken to bring order to the questions of privatization. A 
special commission has been set up to check the use of buildings 
that are state property. The commission has been given until 15 
July to present proposals on correcting the privatization 
process in Karelia.

  [Text] A meeting has taken place in Chita between 
representatives of the autonomous region of Inner Mongolia in 
the PRC with Chita Oblast Administration Head Boris Ivanov. Our 
correspondent Vyacheslav Shirokiy reports: 
  [Shirokiy] This meeting was the logical continuation of the 
recent visit by Russia's Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to 
the PRC. That is why the further prospects for trade and 
economic, border and transport interaction between the two 
border regions of China and Russia were the main issues of the 
diplomatic meetings in the Transbaykal region. In particular, 
the sides decided to ask the governments of both countries about 
opening a PRC Consulate in Chita. True, initially, because of a 
shortage of funds, a branch of the PRC consulate in Khabarovsk 
will be operating in Chita. Apart from this, the Chita and 
Chinese sides noted the fact that their trade relations have 
reached a far higher level. Therefore, investing funds in joint 
enterprises for the production of consumer goods is now far more 
advantageous both for Russia and China: For instance, by the 
autumn a meat processing combine will be built jointly in 
Akshinskiy, in Chita Oblast. 
  The prospect of building the Irkutsk - Ulan-Ude - Chita - 
PRC 
powerline aroused considerable interest among the guests: 
Surplus electricity will pass from Russia to China and the other 
way round. It is planned to settle all these operations 
exclusively in freely convertible currency. The economies of 
the two countries are sufficiently developed for such a step, it 
was noted at the meeting.

<F P=106> [V. Voropayev video report; from the "Dalniy Vostok" program] </F>
  [Text] Inhabitants of the southern Kuril Islands have sent 
telegrams to the Russian president, the Federal Assembly, and 
the oblast governor outlining their disastrous economic 
situation. A particularly tense situation has developed at the 
Yuzhno-Kurilsk fish processing combine -- Kunashir Island's 
basic enterprise. High prices and astronomic transport costs 
have made Kuril goods completely uncompetitive. The fish 
processing workers expressed a negative attitude towards the 
Federal Kuril Islands Development Program. The Yuzhno-Kurilsk 
fish processing combine strike committee, in signing the 
telegrams, warns that there is a developing opinion among the 
people driven to despair about the expediency of the Kurils' 
secession from Sakhalin Oblast. 
  True, the strike committee did not elaborate further as to 
what the independent islands are going to do and whether this 
will help to improve the lives of the Kuril people. However, 
this is just another indication that neglect of the outlying 
regions' interests by the federal authorities could lead to an 
upset of stability in Russia's Far East. The meeting of the 
Russian Federation Government Commission for Operational Issues, 
on 25 May, noted the danger of the Maritime Kray's economic 
separation from Russia. This is further exacerbated by the 
critical social and economic processes in the Maritime Kray and 
the demographic pressures from neighboring China. As a 
countermeasure, it was proposed to form a commission to prepare 
proposals on the stabilization of the situation in the region 
and prospects for its development in the context of Russia's 
geopolitical interests in the Asia-Pacific region -- this is a 
quote. This is how they express alarm in Moscow over the fate 
of far eastern Russia -- mostly through lip service.

<F P=106> [Report by Dmitriy Latipov: "What the Bankers Will Discuss"] </F>
  [Text] The goal set by the International Banking Congress, 
which will take place in Vladivostok on 12-16 September, is to 
discuss the problems of establishing a solid creditworthy 
regional banking system and strengthening its influence on the 
process of bringing the Far East's economy into the world market 
and Pacific economic integration. 
  The idea of the congress is supported by the Central Bank of 
Russia, a number of ministries and agencies, and the Central 
Bank's main administration for the Far East. 
  So what do the bankers intend to discuss at their congress? 
  First and foremost, the task is to give Asia-Pacific region 
financiers a real understanding of the state of the Russian Far 
East economy. There will also be a discussion of the state of 
the banking business in Russia and its special features in the 
Far Eastern region. The bankers will exchange experiences of 
business development in the course of reforming a national 
economy. 
  The International Banking Congress promises to be quite 
representative. About 300 foreign and Russian commercial banks, 
exchanges, joint-stock companies, joint enterprises, 
enterprises, and organizations in the Far East have been invited 
to participate. The names of just a few of them will suffice to 
get an idea of how impressive this undertaking is. For instance, 
among those who have already accepted an invitation to 
participate are the Central Bank of Russia, the Bank of Tokyo, 
the Deutschebank, Credit Suisse, the Manhattan Bank, the 
Russian-American Foundation, Far Eastern commercial banks, and 
others. 
  The congress will feature an exhibition of investment and 
innovation projects. The organizational committee is ready to 
accept such projects for review and assist in their placement. 
  It is assumed that the congress will adopt a declaration on 
the basic directions of interaction between Asia-Pacific region 
banks and will work out recommendations for Far Eastern 
commercial banks on development strategy and prospects. 
  The congress organizational committee addressed future 
participants: "We will be grateful to those bankers and joint 
venture entrepreneurs who are able to send to the congress 
organizational committee comments and proposals for improving 
foreign economic activities, foreign currency regulation, 
investment policy, and financial and organizational conditions. 
Please contact us at 71 Svetlanskaya, [Vladivostok] 690008, 
telephone 26-69-33, 22-80-19."

  [Text] Today, while the town of Svobodnyy-18 toils away in 
its normal routine manner, the chief center for space research 
is being created on the foundations of a former missile unit. 
The Ministry of Defense has already allocated half a billion 
rubles to ensure its survival and the city's development. 
[Video shows aerial shots of Svobodnyy-18 town] 
  New complexes for launching regular space rockets will be 
constructed on the basis of several launching pads that have 
survived. The first launch of this kind is planned for the 
beginning of 1996. 
  Everyone can see for themselves that it is perfectly safe to 
live and work in the space research center; the Geiger counter 
indicates a perfectly normal radiation background even near a 
blown up nuclear missile silo. [Video shows uniformed personnel 
inspecting exploded rocket silo] 
  What is the immediate outlook for developing Svobodnyy-18? 
This was the subject of our talk with Colonel Kalanchev, chief 
of staff of the center for space research. 
  [Begin recording] [Kalanchev] We have two leading documents 
on the basis of which we conduct our work. Thorough technical 
inspections of all buildings, structures, and technical systems 
have been carried out, and orders for necessary equipment have 
been placed. Plans have been made, and the necessary assets for 
implementing these plans are being accumulated. 
  [Pokidov] You have made an interesting statement: We are 
military people, and if we are ordered, we will launch a 
spaceship within a month. 
  [Kalanchev] Of course, we will not be able to prepare a 
serious launch within a month, especially if it is a booster 
rocket. But military unit No. 06-660, which has been created for 
the realization of these plans, will carry out its goals in 
accordance with the timetable set by Colonel General Ivanov, 
commander of the military space forces, and of course by the 
minister of defense. 
  [Pokidov] In other words, everything depends on financing. 
  [Kalanchev] On financing first and foremost, but also on 
goals and schedules set for us. [end recording]

    [Editorial Report] Minsk Radio Minsk Network in Belarusian 
at 1000 GMT on 5 June on the armed forces radio program carries 
an interview with Lieutenant General Yawgen Bacharow, head of 
the border guards. The resolution on the border guards was 
passed in September 1991, almost three years ago. Bacharow, 
speaking in Russian says: 
  "The number of border guards has more than doubled since 
then. New formations and units have been created to carry out 
tasks in a new direction. The border guards acquired their own 
air force, which considerably raised the mobility and improved 
the manoeuvring potential of formations and units. The guards 
also changed in quality. Formations started appearing that were 
almost totally based on professional staffing. In this short 
period of time a material and social basis was created, which 
made it possible not in words, but in deeds, to tackle 
independently all of the tasks facing us." 
  Bacharow continued: "The guards are sufficiently equipped 
with up-to-date weapons and hardware. We have good relations 
with the border guards of neighboring states: Russia, Ukraine 
Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland. We are establishing relations 
with border guards in Germany and France. This is natural, for 
it is possible to solve the whole complex of border guard tasks 
properly today only with full mutual understanding and concise 
interaction of all services within this or that state and deep 
integration of analogous processes in all Europe." 
  Bacharow says: "A few words about the operational situation. 
Today it is more complex than ever. Such negative phenomena as 
the drugs, illegal immigration, and weapons trading have moved 
to the number one spot. Although the border guards do not have 
a direct link with any of them, during everyday life and 
activity they constantly come up against them. The following 
figures show that the situation is become more complicated. 
During six months in 1993, 396 violaters of the state border 
were detained. Five months into 1994 the number is already 948, 
including over 200 detained according to information from the 
departmental service of active measures or by the service 
itself. Since its creation, this service--which is understaffed 
by 50 percent--is operating at the level of a good combat border 
detachment, although it has about 20 times less personnel. It 
has been proved possible to violate our republic's frontier with 
impunity. We make no secret of this. During six months in 1993 
there were five cases. In 1994 there was only one case. 
Seventeen criminal cases resulted from violations of the state 
frontier. In 1993 there were only two criminal cases. Of these 
17 cases, seven were organizers from the new legislation passed 
by the Supreme Soviet. In 1993 contraband worth 0.8 billion 
rubles was confiscated; in 1994 the amount was 11.5 billion. In 
1993 170 weapons were confiscated, and in 1994 the figure was 
286. In 1993 123 tonnes of nonferrous metals and in 1994 248 
tonnes were confiscated. Narcotics: In 1993, 17.3 kg were 
confiscated, and in 1994 over 80 kg were confiscated. Border 
guards received hard currency amounting to over $780,000 from 
fees for detention and for visas. If all of this is converted 
into Belarusian rubles, in five months the border guards 
themselves paid 50 percent of their annual budget. We hope that 
by the end of this year, as in 1993, we will pay the entire 100 
percent of our annual budget ourselves." [sentence as heard] 
  Having stressed the difficulties of the job, Bacharow went 
on 
to say: "The fight against illegal immigration is the top 
priority because it is the source of all evils today. We do 
have the necessary legislative basis, but it has to be 
perfected. As commander and as a member of parliament, I am 
particularly concerned by the fact that the drugs business is 
moving to a qualitatively new basis. I am consciously making 
this statement; yes indeed, to a qualitatively new basis. Until 
now the republic was only a transshipment base, but there are 
now incidents that confirm that the republic is becoming a 
market for drug sales. This is a very dangerous point, a very 
dangerous sign. We were forced to fight the drugs business 
before now, but even today it is not too late. In the very near 
future a joint group must be created, a joint department, 
perhaps a joint administration of the KGB, MVD, border guards, 
and customs to deal with this issue directly. So far, our 
efforts are at the level of the stone age."

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Starikevich: "Belorussian [Belarusian] </F>
Government Does Not Wish To Cooperate With George Soros"] 
  [Text] Minsk -- The Belorussian communists and government 
have finally become united on a platform of hostility toward the 
West. This was again confirmed by the events which occurred 
prior to, during, and after the visit to Minsk of George Soros, 
founder of a network of charitable funds. 
  George Soros has invested about $2 million in Belorussia 
[Belarus] in the past one and a half years. This money has gone 
into the support and development of science, education, and 
other sectors. All programs pursue one goal: the creation of 
an open society. 
  Soros' funds are working on a similar basis in Russia and 
other countries which were once members of the socialist camp. 
The governments of practically all states are showing interest 
in cooperation with this organization -- except the Belorussian 
Government. 
  The Belorussian Government head has instructed the 
administration for coordinating the activities of the Council of 
Ministers administrative organs to investigate what the "Soros 
Belarus Fund" is doing. An interesting document has found its 
way into IZVESTIYA's possession which provides evidence about 
the Belorussian authorities' attitude to this organization. 
This memorandum was signed by Government Secretary Gennadiy 
Danilov, whose successes in exposing enemy spies on the 
Republic's territory are well known to Belorussian citizens. 
Here are some quotations from the document. 
  "...The fund is gearing its activities toward changing 
people's outlooks, inculcating the American way of life, and 
attracting cheap intellectual resources from our republic to the 
fundamental, natural, and social sciences in the United States." 
  The grounds for such a serious indictment are outlined 
below. 
It emerges that the Belorussian Ministry of Education proposed 
to American specialists that studies be organized in the United 
States for kindergarten workers, teachers, and school students. 
Gennadiy Danilov comes to the following conclusion: "In this 
way, the fund set about reorganizing the entire education system 
and training cadres for the future creation of an open society." 
  The government secretary goes on to expose the fund's 
intrigues in the field of publishing: "The programs' leaders 
give preference to foreign authors when publishing scientific 
literature. The publication of literature proceeds unchecked, 
without the Belorussian side providing analysis and expert 
opinion...." Moreover, "the program to develop the mass media 
has not escaped the fund's attention. Its aim is to abolish the 
state monopoly in the organs of the press and television...." 
  As you see, we are still in an age in Belorussia in which 
the 
state wants to have complete control over publishing activities 
and the mass media. It is no secret that this kind of control 
is one of the most important conditions for the revival of 
totalitarianism. Therefore, the "Soros Belarus Fund," which is 
operating strictly within existing laws, is provoking a negative 
emotional reaction from the present republic leadership. 
  It also follows from the memorandum's text that from as far 
back as 1992, the relevant bodies have been paying careful 
attention to Elizabeth Smedley, executive director of the "Soros 
Belarus Fund," knowing exactly whom she has met with and when, 
and where these meetings have taken place. The summary says: 
"Based on the above, it is becoming obvious that having the 
opportunity to act without interference, the fund has been 
striving to orient the republic's development toward Western 
traditions and values, make changes to the state-political 
system, and prepare the ground for implementing the idea of 
creating a social system based on an open society...." 
  But consider another interesting fact: The communist 
newspaper MY I VREMYA [TIME AND US] published in its 30 May 
issue an item saying that thanks to the Soros Fund's efforts 
"the working people have begun to die out" in Belorussia. The 
article's author did not even take the trouble to paraphrase the 
document cited above: Whole chunks of the article are identical 
to paragraphs in the memorandum without, it has to be said, 
reference being made to the original source (even the 
typographical errors and inaccuracies in the government document 
are repeated). This is a clear demonstration that what the 
government has on its mind is what the communists are talking 
about, which is evidence of the degree of independence of the 
latter from the power structures. 
  The fact that the communists are accusing Soros of every 
mortal sin is not surprising. But the prime minister also 
revealed his true motives for not wishing to meet with the 
American philanthropist after his departure. Kebich stated that 
he does not wish to meet with the person who has destroyed the 
Belorussian economy. 
  As the most effective programs are those which are carried 
out with the government's cooperation (in this case you cannot 
count on this), George Soros will reduce the volume of his aid 
to Belorussia. He also does not intend to invest money here in 
his capacity as a businessman, as he cannot see any signs of 
economic reform. 
  By isolating itself from everybody else, the Belorussian 
nomenklatura is hoping to recreate for itself the little world 
in which it once lived very well.

Relations and member of the Peasants and Intellectuals Bloc, 
stated to BASA. According to him "there are few states so 
seriously and constantly interested in the situation in Moldova 
and therefore Turkey's economic interest and its 
military-strategic interest should not be neglected." He said 
that "President Demirel's arrival in Chisinau is an important 
step toward finding foreign partners that could support Moldova 
during its crisis." On the other hand Nedelciuc noted that 
"Demirel's arrival has implications that should worry those who 
carefully observe negotiations between Chisinau officials and 
Comrat separatists' representatives." He stated that he "was 
bewildered that the Chisinau officials went so far in the 
negotiations with the Gagauz representatives," when he studied 
the project on special status for Gagauzians. He mentioned that 
the project "contains provisions sometimes granted to 
independent states, but by accepting it parliamentary leaders 
will make not only a political but a historical mistake." 
According to Nedelciuc "if the talks between Demirel, Snegur 
and the Gagauzian side support this variant, the Parliament will 
not be able to impose another point of view, even though it will 
want to adopt a new law because Demirel's arrival will only 
complicate the situation."

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 2/6/1994 -- "You, Gagauzians, 
are part of a greater nation we are two branches of the same 
tree," stated today Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, 
addressing about 500 people from the districts densely inhabited 
by Gagauzians who gathered in "Druzhba" cinema in Comrat to take 
part in the meeting with the Moldovan and Turkish presidents. 
"I am grateful that you have maintained yourselves as a nation, 
and thanks to Moldovan leadership we have met as a mother with 
her son," said Demirel. He sent the regards of the Turkish 
people and mentioned that Turkey will continue to cooperate with 
Moldova to assist all ethnic groups. "I hope that the Gagauz 
people will really appreciate this historical act and our common 
efforts." Demirel appealed to the people: "Gagauz brothers, do 
not confine yourselves in your own shell. By supporting 
Moldova's territorial integrity, for which you voted on 6 March, 
you acquired the support of Turkey and many countries. The 
Moldovan leadership offers you possibilities for development. 
Do not forget this and do not forget the international right 
that must be above all other rights. Be correct and analyze the 
essence of things, because dialogue and only dialogue will help 
you." In Demirel's opinion Gagauzians must be a bridge of 
friendship between Turkey and Moldova. Stepan Topal president 
of the self-proclaimed Gagauz Republic expressed gratitude to 
Presidents Snegur and Demirel for the possibility offered to 
Gagauzians to develop their culture traditions and for 
contributing to the Gagauzians national rebirth. "I am grateful 
to the current Moldovan leadership for its willingness to grant 
the `Gagauz-Eri- Gagauzia' special juridical status to 
Gagauzians. The fact that a representative of the Council of 
Europe called Moldova `a country of wisdom' proves this," said 
Topal. He stated that this project will be presented to the 
Moldovan Parliament to be confirmed. This way of settling 
ethnic problems could serve an example for other regions. 
Snegur pointed out that Chisinau officials are aware that 
Gagauzians have much in common with the Turkish people who 
support them spiritually and financially in their national 
rebirth. This has become possible only after Moldova declared 
its sovereignty said Snegur. "Gagauzian is studied now in 
Southern Moldova in 48 schools and Comrat university and 
college, it can be heard on the Moldovan Television and Radio 
and local television and radio stations. The current Moldovan 
leadership supports Gagauzians' aspirations to develop their 
culture and traditions. The `Gagauz-Eri-Gagauzia' project was 
recently finalized. It will open new prospects in this regard. 
Moldovan republican organs grant the districts densely 
inhabited by Gagauzians much empowerment." The friendship and 
cooperation agreement to be signed tomorrow by Moldovan and 
Turkish presidents, will consolidate the relations between the 
two countries, the development of democracy and support the 
rebirth of national minorities, mentioned Snegur. He mentioned 
that Turkey will grant Moldova credit worth $35 million to be 
invested in the development of the Southern Moldovan districts. 
  Dionisie Tanasoglo, rector of Comrat University handed 
President Suleyman Demirel diploma of honorary doctorate. The 
Turkish President said that Comrat University will be the 59th 
university alongside 57 in Turkey and one in Middle Asia, where 
Turkish is studied. The visit in Comrat continued with the 
laying of the first stones of the foundation of the 
Moldovan-Turkish tile and brick factory. The president also 
attended an exhibition of Gagauz craftsmanship and a concert, in 
the afternoon the members of the delegation held a series of 
meetings in the villages of the Ciadar-Lunga district.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 2/6/1994 -- "I am absolutely 
sure that we will rapidly develop cooperation and friendship 
between Moldova and Turkey by adding to current possibilities 
our wish to cooperate in advantageous areas in the near future. 
We believe that the opportunity to use successfully the 
region's potential both with countries within the Black Sea 
basin and through other bilateral relations," said the Turkish 
President Suleyman Demirel in his yesterday' speech in the 
Moldovan Parliament. He emphasized that Turkey is in favor of 
"an independent and free Moldova within the international 
community" and that "it will make efforts to assure partnership 
relations founded on mutual respect, that will contribute to the 
development of the Moldovan national economy with the help of 
Turkish businessmen who have the necessary expertise and means. 
In order to consolidate Moldova's independence, Turkey 
guarantees its support and makes public its friendly 
intentions." President Demirel pointed out that in the current 
situation "it is very useful to establish tight relations 
between the Turkish Great Assembly and Moldovan Parliament. The 
Turkish legislators are accompanying me to achieve these 
objectives." Demirel also said: "Representatives of a branch of 
Turkish peoples, whose ancestors were among the first dwellers 
in this region, live in Moldova. I want to stress that we are 
sure that the Gagauz people will be a strong link of friendship 
between Moldova and Turkey. The Gagauz people are a reason for 
Turks' attachment to Moldova make them sympathized with it and 
want tighter relations with your country for which Turkey has 
the most sincere feelings. Turkey's interests in the Gagauzians 
should be understood as an expression of the importance Turkey 
gives to Moldova's territorial integrity, peace, economic, 
social and cultural development. Gagauzians, in their 
motherland are citizens who respect Moldova's territorial 
integrity and who are aware of their citizenship. We support 
from the bottom of our hearts the prospects for granting a 
special juridical status that will assure the preservation of 
Gagauzians' national identity." Previously during a meeting with 
parliamentary leadership and leaders of the four parliamentary 
factions Demirel said that "the Parliament should be the place 
where controversies occur and where finally adequate solutions 
to any problems can be found. A democracy cannot be built 
without opposition, but if it negates the state's existence, 
than this country should condemn it or even sanction it."

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 2/6/1994 -- We consider that 
the visit of Turkish President Suleyman Demirel will not 
discourage the normalization of the situation in the Southern 
regions, Valeriu Senic, leader of the parliamentary bloc of 
socialists, declared to BASA. Senic mentioned that the Turkish 
president has manifested his best intentions, underlining his 
support for the integrity and sovereignty of Moldova. In 
Senic's opinion, all the assertions Demirel has made will be 
treated only as an impulse toward mutual understanding. At the 
same time Senic mentioned that the deputies had already received 
the project of special juridical status for the Southern regions 
and the Socialist Unity faction supports it. We do not consider 
that the visit of the Turkish delegation will in any way 
influence the adoption of this status for President Demirel 
arrived after the status had already been defined stated Senic.

the Turkic-speaking population. 
  Snegur characterised Moldovan-Turkish relations as 
excellent. 
"Our cooperation is developing dynamically in many spheres," he

  For his part, Demirel expressed satisfaction that "those 
contradictions which there were between the Gagauz population 
and the republic's central authorities are being solved by 
granting special juridical status to the areas densely populated 
by the Gagauzs." He also reported that a conference of the 
heads of the Black Sea region states is to be held in the near

<F P=106> [Report by Svitlana Chala from Chisinau: "There Is the Law </F>
on Borders. There Is No Border Itself"] 
  [Text] The Moldovan Parliament approved the Law on State 
Borders, the absence of which had given rise to complaints on 
the part of border guards for almost two years. Lately, the 
Moldovan-Romanian border has increasingly become a corridor 
through which narcotics and weapons are smuggled into Western 
Europe and which residents of Southeast Asia and various 
criminals have been trying to cross in search of a better life. 
  Due to the absence of legal norms the border has, in fact, 
remained "transparent," and trespassers were, in the worst case, 
deported from the [Moldovan] Republic -- to Ukraine or to 
Russia. Soon, they were again detained at the same place, and 
the circular movement continued. 
  Moldova borders upon two states -- Romania and Ukraine. 
However, whereas the Moldovan-Romanian border is clearly 
defined, because it used to be the state border in the former 
USSR, in the case of Ukraine it remained, until recently, just 
an administrative border. Although the law approved by the 
parliament attached an official status to it, no clear-cut 
demarcation line has been drawn. An intergovernmental 
Moldovan-Ukrainian commission is presently defining it. 
However, according to parliamentary speaker P. Luchinschi, this 
issue requires time. 
  Deputies of the Popular Front faction drew the parliament's 
attention to the problem of the "Danube Triangle" -- 800 
borderline meters along the Danube near the town of Reni. 
Moldova counts upon this triangle, planning to build a port 
there and ensure exit to the Black Sea for itself. According to 
the Moldovan minister of security, this question is being 
discussed at a corresponding interstate level.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 1/6/1994 -- The ninth round of 
the Moldovan-Russian negotiations concerning the status and 
terms of withdrawal of the 14th Russian Army from Moldovan 
territory will be held on 7 and 8 June in Moscow, stated to BASA 
Ion Nastac, head of the press secretariat of the Ministry of 
Defence. The official Moldovan delegation will be headed by 
Nicolae Osmochescu, vice-minister of foreign affairs, specified 
the cited source. Colonel Nicolae Tudureanu will lead the group 
of military experts. With the approval of both Moldovan and 
Russian delegations, representatives of Tiraspol will be allowed 
to attend the negotiations. The previous round of talks was 
held in March 1994 in Chisinau. The negotiators did not agree 
on the terms of withdrawal of the Russian armed forces from 
Moldova, for the Russian delegation wanted Moldova to grant 
Dniester a spectral juridical status in conjunction with its 
withdrawal. At this meeting the Moldovan delegation was headed 
by Anatol Taran, former ambassador of Moldova to Moscow.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 31/5/1994 -- The Moldovan 
economy gained a lot by becoming full member of the World Bank 
in August 1992. These statements were made during the visit by 
the World Bank vice president Welfred Thaiwitz to Moldova. 
Moldovan officials pointed out that the World Bank is "a 
co-author of the economic transformations in Moldova." Welfred 
Thaiwitz was certain of the irreversible character of the 
reforms and the effectiveness of Moldovan authorities' efforts 
to improve the economy. He pointed out that "the World Bank 
will further grant financial support for supporting reforms in 
Moldova." World Bank experts assert that there have been some 
achievements -- the most important being the stability of the 
national currency in relation with the U.S. dollar and the 
reduction in inflation. Official statistics indicate a 
surprising decrease in inflation to 5 percent in April compared 
to 45 percent in January. The last auctions of the Interbank 
Currency Exchange indicate the stability of the leu. Winson 
Temple, UN permanent representative to Moldova, hastened to 
declare that the pace of reform in Moldova exceeds the pace in 
Russia and even the Baltic republics. Obviously, Temple stated 
that the economic situation in Moldova very difficult, 
mentioning that the national income decreased by 50 percent in 
the last three years. It is obvious that given such 
difficulties, without foreign hard currency injection it would 
be impossible to reanimate an economy undergoing recession. 
Moldova has been granted credits amounting to $86 million by 
the World Bank and it stands to receive more. During his visit 
to Chisinau Thaiwitz did not specify a figure for the eventual 
loans. However, sources from banks say that another $150 
million could be granted. "The World Bank can grant Moldova 
significant financial assistance its reforms are successfully 
promoted," stated Thaiwitz. He especially insisted on 
privatization of state property, thereby making a qualitative 
leap in the "structural reform" of the economy. It can be 
easily seen that the Chisinau officials to all possible in order 
not to lose credibility in the eyes of the international 
financial organizations. The statements made by the 
decision-makers in the area of economics regarding the 
acceleration of the privatization process, realization of 
structural reforms in industry, and the assurance that the 
international agreements and especially the Memorandum concluded 
with the IMF will be respected are significant. Regardless of 
government measures and substantial financial support, realities 
press hard on the Moldovan economy. Industrial output is 
falling. Financial blockage which has engendered general 
insolvency has the most pressing effects. Undertaking complete 
price liberalization while many salaries go unpaid under can 
provoke much dissatisfaction. Even the presidential decree on 
increasing the minimum salary to 18 lei seems not to diminish 
from the weight of the burden carried by the population, since 
the average salary covers only 30 percent of the minimum 
consumption budget. On the other hand, the recent price 
liberalization and salary raid could lead to a new wave of 
inflation that will aggravate the economic situation.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 2/6/1994 -- The Union of Public 
Organizations Parties and Movements organized a rally yesterday 
in Tiraspol. Professor V. Yakovlev, former deputy of the 
Moldovan Parliament known for his orthodox communist views, is 
the leader of the union. V. Yakovlev and representatives of 
other political organizations opposed the promotion of market 
economic reforms in Dniester and the introduction of private 
ownership of land and privatization in general. Appeals to 
restore the Soviet Union could be heard during the rally. 
Yakovlev declared that recently an initiative group had been 
created to bring about the creation of a union of unrecognized 
states. It is assumed that alongside Dniester, Abkhazia, 
Karabakh and another breakaway regions will be members of this 
union. The rally attracted about 1,000 people, most of whom 
were elderly. People carried red flags and sang the USSR's 
anthem. Local observers note that the rally was not obstructed 
by militia although the emergency state prolonged by Igor 
Smirnov [Dniester president] forbids such manifestations.

  [Text] Tiraspol BASAPRESS, 3/6/1994 -- The Dniester 
Republic's delegation will not disregard the referendum which 
expresses the independence of the Dniester Republic's people and 
its right to individual statehood, stated today to Tiraspol 
Radio Ana Volkova, former member of the Dniester delegation 
attending the negotiations on granting a special juridical 
status to the eastern districts. Nicolae Andronic, Moldovan 
deputy speaker of parliament, stated to Tiraspol Radio on 31 May 
that the Tiraspol leaders are to be blamed for jeopardizing the 
settlement of the Dniester conflict. Concerning these 
statements, Volkova mentioned that the Moldovan Parliament's 
statements contain "inaccuracies or even distortions of events." 
Volkova said that Andronic's statements are unfounded. She 
mentioned that it was the Tiraspol representatives who proposed 
a plan for a confederation in Moldova. Volkova said that if 
Chisinau had accepted that plan, the Dniester conflict would 
have been solved long ago. Volkova added that it was the 
Moldovan delegation who left the negotiations "arguing that the 
commission's members were on vacation or that the parliament was 
dissolved."

  [Text] Next in our program you'll hear a speech of the 
president of the Moldavian [Moldovan] Republic of Pridnestrovye 
[Dniester], Igor Smirnov, on the results of economic development 
of the Republic, which was broadcast over the national 
television channel of Pridnestrovye. 
  [Begin Smirnov recording in Moldovan fading to English 
translation] I put a political settlement of disturbances 
between Moldova and Pridnestrovye at the head of the list. 
Issues were widely covered in the press but nonetheless, 
continuing this topic, I must say, that for the time being a 
number of contracts and agreements have been concluded following 
the agreement signed by President Snegur and President Smirnov 
in the presence of the CSCE mission and the special envoy of the 
Russian president. 
  These agreements include not only economic matters but also 
those concerning the cooperation of law enforcement bodies, the 
mutual exploitation of air space, cooperation in the customs 
affairs and the public health protection. So we can see our 
cooperation is continuing. 
  There are various opinions about these problems both in 
Moldova and Pridnestrovye. For instance, in Moldova they say 
that Snegur has recognized Pridnestrovye, while Pridnestrovyan 
oppositions have said [words indistinct] enough in the question 
on the Pridnestrovyan confederation. I would like to make some 
explanation. What is important for a concrete [as heard] man 
are not only negotiations or any political (shape). The only 
things which matter is his living standard, which is the 
fundamental principle that forms the basis of our relations, and 
which is stipulated in the agreement, [words indistinct], the 
further progress in our economic relations. The main 
achievements so far in the establishment of the bank accounting 
center provide payment between Moldova and Pridnestrovye. 
Generally speaking, I must stress that we have a positive trade 
balance in our trade with Moldova because we sell them more 
goods than we get from them. That is, the normal process of 
cooperation is going on. 
  As for our relations with Russia, I must say that they are 
the best and [words indistinct]. No matter what our enemies 
say, but we work on the government level, we work on the 
parliament level, they understand us and our cooperation is 
mainly of economic character. Pay attention that we don't put 
forward any questions, we don't ask to recognize us as a state. 
You see, we don't need to get involved in political affairs 
because these can destabilize the situation in nearby countries. 
We propose just to cooperate as equal partners which means in 
principle by de-facto recognition -- not even the political 
recognition or economic alone. 
  Our economic relations with Ukraine are much better now but 
still there is the main problem in creating trade joint 
ventures. I must say that we have the expert balance of trade 
not only with Moldova, but also with Russia and Ukraine, where 
it amounts respectively to 14 and 25 milliard rubles. Of all 
our neighbors, only Belorussia [Belarus] is an exception from 
this rule. Our import from Belorussia exceeds our export there 
which should be corrected because the exporting country is 
always in more preferential position. This process is much 
influenced by the different national currencies and other 
difficulties in payment. 
  Of course we don't refuse from the cooperation with Western 
countries. This year, by the way, a number of foreign 
businessmen invested their money in the development of our 
economy [word indistinct]. Speaking about Western investment in 
our economy, we can't help mentioning such enterprises as [words 
indistinct] plants of refrigerated trucks/trailers in Tiraspol, 
metallurgic and [word indistinct] plants in [words indistinct] 
and many other and I won't enumerate them all because they'll 
take a long time. Nevertheless, this fact is not a confirmation 
that European countries are ready to cooperate with us in this 
sphere. 
  The situation in agriculture is not brilliant as it was 
expected to be. I mean first of all bad weather conditions. 
Due to the recent drought and continued spell of hot dry winds 
and also because of light frost, the situation in agriculture 
has worsened which requires additional expense. We had to 
restore about 70 percent of area under crops and in this case 
against the main burden is shouldered on our industry. 
Industrial enterprises must earn enough money to buy grain not 
only for baking but also for fodder. Our sowing campaign was 
followed by a re-sowing one but all the crops however will be 
used as a fodder due to bad weather. 
  Except for power sources, grain and sugar are two main 
products whose production is strictly controlled by the 
government, and I must say that we have taken certain measures 
to provide us with a sufficient quantity of elementary products. 
As for the livestock breeding, here we have chosen another way 
and now we have completed a special agreement in order to 
provide a full capacity (operation) of livestock breeding 
complexes on the following conditions. We'll sell 50 per cent 
of meat (and they'll) supply us with forage. Another 50 per cent 
will be distributed on our own market. This scheme allows us to 
provide enough forage to increase the total amount of livestock 
and especially of pedigreed livestock. In agriculture, we also 
welcome foreign investments. We have many joint ventures with 
Israeli firms, with (agri-business) enterprises from Hungary and 
Germany and we will continue our cooperation but we are not 
going to sell our land for our main means of production. Our 
task is to attract investors in order to provide jobs for all 
[words indistinct] population. 
  During more than three years of its existence, our republic 
becomes more firm in its position from day to day and our main 
position remains the same as before. Every man [word 
indistinct] on this land should have equal rights with others, 
should be able to display his abilities and live free regardless 
of his nationality or language. [end recording]

  [Text] Tiraspol BASAPRESS, 3/6/1994 -- The Tiraspol Court 
examined today the case of Colonel Bergman [commander of an army 
division] who is being sued by Igor Smirnov, president of the 
Dniester Republic, who claims moral damages. Smirnov estimated 
at 100 million rubles the damages caused by Bergman's 
disclosures, especially regarding the $1.5 million the Tiraspol 
leader withdrew from accounts with Austrian banks. As a 
witness, Tiraspol Finance Minister Oleg Natakhin confirmed that 
in November 1993 he was in Vienna with Smirnov and Coloti, from 
the Dniester Republic's bank, intending to open a correspondent 
account of the Dniester bank in an Austrian bank. Natakhin said 
he does not know whether Smirnov withdrew the $1.5 million. 
Colonel Bergman made a statement asserting that the court 
violates the penal code and the legal procedures and it is 
biased. A recess has been called: The trial will continue when 
another judge is appointed. The date of the next session was 
not specified. The court hall was surrounded by women waving 
banners with insults against General Lebed [commander of the 
14th Russian Army stationed in Dniester] and Colonel Bergman.

  [Text] A delegation of leading British businessmen, led by 
George Young, minister for housing, inner cities and 
construction, has ended its visit to the republic. The outcome 
of the visit was concluded by a news conference held at the 
Kazakh Ministry of Construction. It was noted that Great 
Britain last year ranked fifth in the foreign trade turnover of 
our republic, with 12 joint Kazakh-British ventures functioning 
at the moment. Representatives of British major businesses 
continue to establish ties with the economic structures of 
Kazakhstan, even during this visit. As is known, the winner of 
the tender for the Karachaganak deposit development in West 
Kazakhstan oblast is the British Gas company. Together with the 
Italian Agip, the British Enterprise Oil and the Spanish Ereston 
companies, British Gas won the tender for the search for 
hydrocarbons in the promising Bayganin field in Aktyubinsk 
oblast. The British [name indistinct] company successfully 
completed talks on setting up a joint venture with Kazakh firms 
in Mangistau oblast. British businesses are displaying evident 
interest in the development of the Republic's construction 
complex. An accord has already been reached whereby British 
companies and banks will participate in the modernization of the 
construction industry and the training of personnel. Joint 
production will be set up, including use of new technology and 
know-how, and projects which are of mutual benefit for both 
sides will receive investment.

Flight on two wings is a guarantee of our sovereignty. Russia 
is our main ally and trade partner. We think we shall pass this

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Krasnoschekov] </F>
  [Text] Paris 3 June TASS -- "Today is a historical day for 
the independent Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan], whose people chose a 
path of true democratic development, formation of a legal state 
and economic reforms," President of Kirghizia Asker Akayev said 
at a solemn ceremony held in the Elysee Palace today, during 
which he signed the Paris Charter for a New Europe of the 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). This 
document was adopted by CSCE member states in 1990, and France 
is its depositary. 
  The Kirghiz president emphasised that the Paris Charter is 
based on principles of maintaining stability and security in the 
world, and triumph of democracy and human rights, the main 
values, which must help human civilization make progress, so 
that in the XXI century mankind does not have to know war, 
sufferings and dangers which we are encountering now. "I signed 
this document with a clear conscience, as we in Kirghizia affirm 
the same ideas of personal freedom, political and economic 
liberties, priority to protection of rights, interests and 
dignity of mankind," he said. 
  Asker Akayev especially noted France's important 
contribution 
to the development of European partnership, establishment of 
contacts between the West and the East, its role in preparing 
and signing the final document of the CSCE Treaty signed in 
Europe and the Paris Charter for a New Europe. 
  Having signed the Paris Charter for a New Europe, France has 
become a full-fldged member of the vast international 
community," President Francois Mitterrand said at the signing 
ceremony. This document marks the end of the "cold war" and 
division of the world into two confronting military blocs, and, 
thus, has opened `new times' in relations between states, he 
emphasised. 
  The two heads of state signed a treaty of understanding, 
friendship and cooperation between Kirghizia and France, as well 
as a number of other bilateral agreements on the develoment of 
cooperation in political, economic and cultural fields. 
  Asker Akayev noted that Kirghizia attaches great importance 
to these documents, because "French foreign policy has always 
distinguished itself by its well-foundedness, wisdom and 
insight." Francois Mitterrand's recent visit to Central Asian 
republics bears a striking testimony to this fact, he said. 
According to the Kirghiz president, this was a call to leading 
powers of the world to see to it that Central Asian countries 
developed as democratic, secular and civilized states. "I am 
convinced that only this path can lead to progress and 
prosperity of Central Asian states," Asker Akayev said.

  [Text] Dushanbe, 4 Jun -- The beginning of a well-organized 
and directed campaign of terror against the Russian military 
contingent in Tajikistan was how Lieutenant General Anatoliy 
Chechulin, commander of the Russian border troops in the 
Republic, saw the killing of seven Russians, including five 
senior officers, two of whom were border guards. All the 
murders were committed over a short period, from 31 May to 4 
June. 
  Speaking today at an emergency press conference in Dushanbe, 
the commander declared that the border guard leadership "does 
not intend to tolerate any more blows from behind and is 
adopting the most decisive measures to ensure the armed 
protection of its servicemen both at their duty station and at 
their family residences." Anatoliy Chechulin said that other 
action was also to be taken to ensure the servicemen's personal 
security. Authorized weapons and standard-issue military 
hardware were being made available for the protection of Russian 
citizens. 
  The commander demanded that Tajikistan's law-and-order 
bodies 
should adopt all possible measures to catch the criminals, as 
well as a strict and objective investigation. "The criminals," 
declared Gen. Chechulin, "must be brought to justice for what 
they have done."

  [Text] Dushanbe, 4 Jun -- Russia will take all measures to 
protect Russian servicemen and ethnic Russians living in 
Tajikistan. This was stated at a news conference in Dushanbe 
today by Lieutenant General Anatoliy Chechulin, commander of the 
Russian border troops in Tajikistan, in connection with the 
killing of seven Russians, including five senior officers, two 
of whom were border guards. All these were committed in a short 
period between 31 May and 4 June. 
  Mecheslav Senkevich, Russian ambassador to Tajikistan, and 
Major General Afanasiy Kim, military procurator of the Russian 
border troops, who also took part in the news conference, said 
that the question of adopting measures to protect Russians was 
raised today at an emergency session of the Tajikistan 
Government. 
  In the view of General Chechulin, the killings of the 
Russians mark "the start of the implementation of directions 
issued by leaders of the extremist wing of the armed opposition, 
including Sayed Abdullo Nuri, leader of the so-called 
government-in-exile, who have recently called for acts of 
terrorism against Russian servicemen." Their aim, the commander 
stressed, is to destabilize the situation in Tajikistan, to 
wreck the second round of inter- Tajik talks, and also to 
provoke negative public opinion regarding the desirability of a 
Russian military contingent in Tajikistan. 
  Major General Gennadiy Blinov, first deputy interior 
minister 
of Tajikistan, acknowledged that the acts of terrorism against 
Russian servicemen and ethnic Russian officers serving in 
Tajikistan's national armed forces were planned. The search for 
the criminals is being carried out in close contact with the 
Russian military procuracy, he said. ITAR-TASS has learned that 
three individuals suspected of killing Russian officers have 
already been detained. 
  Having stated that the Russian leadership "does not intend 
to 
tolerate any more blows from behind and is adopting the most 
decisive measures to ensure the armed protection of its 
servicemen," General Chechulin called on Tajikistan's bodies of 
law enforcement to take all measures to catch the criminals and 
to carry out a strict and objective investigation. 
  Russian servicemen will do everything to "protect themselves 
from the threat of banditry from whatever source, using their 
professionalism and the force of their weapons," the commander 
of the Russian border troops in Tajikistan stressed.

<F P=106> [Report by Anatoliy Stasovskiy under the "Events and </F>
Commentaries" rubric: "Fifth Victim: Is the Opposition in 
Tajikistan Switching to Terror?"] 
  [Text] Alarming and tragic reports continue to come in 
from Tajikistan. Another two servicemen died on the evening of 
1 June. Private Vladislav Maksakov, who was in charge of a 
border detail, was blown up by a mine laid by gunmen in the 9th 
Border Troop Subunit's section. And in Dushanbe, Lieutenant 
Colonel Yuriy Shkipkin, deputy chief of a Tajik Defense Ministry 
troop service, was killed not far from his home. 
  The investigative commissions of the Russian Border Troops 
and the Tajik law-enforcement agencies hardly have time to get 
to the bottom of one tragedy before another occurs. You cannot 
help noticing that attacks on the military have started to occur 
most frequently in the rear services and as a result of 
terrorist and sabotage acts. According to statements by the 
Tajik law-enforcement agencies, the murders of both Lt. Col. 
Vladimir Borisenkov of the Russian Border Troops (31 May) and 
Lt. Col. Yuriy Shkipkin from the Republic's Defense Ministry are 
criminal offenses. And yet it may be supposed with a high 
degree of probability that gunmen are implicated here. The 
opposition has chosen new tactics for waging the struggle. 
Since the failure of several operations actually on the border 
and substantial losses of mojahedin they have switched to 
sabotage and terror. It is perfectly possible that the current 
stepping up of terrorist activity has been prompted by the 
successful Russian Border Troop operation carried out in the 
section covered by the 8th Border Troop Subunit of the Pyandzh 
border detachment (31 May-1 June) to "squeeze" gunmen out of the 
Naychi peninsula: Several dozen mojahedin were forced to take 
to their heels to save themselves after successful joint actions 
by border troops and servicemen of the Russian 201st Division. 
  Five members of the border troops have fallen victim to 
terrorism already this year. Aware that they are losing support 
even among sympathetic strata of the population, the gunmen are 
acting with special savagery, deviousness, and baseness, but by 
no means do all manage to get away scot-free. According to the 
latest ITAR-TASS report, thanks to operational actions carried 
out by investigations and law-enforcement agencies, an 
inhabitant of Tajikistan was arrested 1 June on suspicion of 
murdering Lt. Col. Borisenkov.

  [Text] Dushanbe 6 June TASS -- Russian border guards 
prevented another attempt by a small group of Tajik opposition 
forces to cross the Afghan-Tajik border on Sunday [5 June] at a 
border stretch guarded by the Pyanj border unit. The attempt 
was stopped by artillery fire, ITAR-TASS learned from sources in 
the headquarters of the Russian border guards in Tajikistan. 
  In another incident on Sunday, an armed person was killed 
when trying to cross into Tajikistan near Khorog from 
Afghanistan. The violator did not heed the border guards' 
warning shots. There were no wounded among the Russian border 
guards in the two indicents.

of the Northeast Asia area. 
  Presidents Kim and Karimov agreed that their countries would 
closely cooperate with each other at international organizations. 
  Karimov said his country would support South Korea's bid to 
obtain a non-permanent seat at the U.N. Security Council.

registered in their bilateral relations in a short period of 
time since their diplomatic normalization.

President Karimov hosted in honor of President and Mrs. Kim. 
  Earlier in the day, President Kim arrived at the Tashkent

  [Text] Aboard special plane en route to Tashkent, 4 June 
(YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam said on Saturday [4 June] 
South Korea and the United States stand fully prepared against 
any contingency over the North Korean nuclear question. 
  While meeting with reporters aboard his plane en route to 
Tashkent following his official visit to Russia, President Kim 
said the two countries have a full grasp of all North Korean 
movements through an around-the clock surveillance system. 
  "A war should be forestalled by all means," Kim said. "But, 
South Korea and the United States possess enough force of arms 
to cope with any contingency." 
  The president said he fully discussed in a telephone 
conversation with U.S. President Bill Clinton a possible 
sanction against North Korea and the issue of national security 
for 35 minutes on Friday. 
  "Cooperation between our two countries is perfect. I 
understand the telephone conversation between Presidents Clinton 
and Boris Yeltsin, too, was satisfactory," he said. 
  Saying that all things seem going well with regard to the 
issue of taking a sanction against North Korea, President Kim 
said, "Our people may be relieved at conditions that may develop 
over the nuclear issue." 
  He also said President Yeltsin promised not to supply any 
weapons either offensive or defensive to North Korea. 
  "Given the fact that Russia had in the past been the main 
supplier of weapons for North Korea, this pledge of Russia has a 
very important bearing," President Kim said.

  [Text] Tashkent, 6 June (YONHAP) -- South Korean President 
Kim Yong-sam held an extended summit meeting Monday [6 June] 
with his Uzbekistani counterpart Islam Karimov to discuss 
promoting economic cooperation and enhancing the rights and 
interests of ethnic Koreans living in Uzbekistan. 
  Kim suggested that the two countries sign a treaty on the 
use 
of natural resources and set up a trade committee to activate 
trade and investment, according to officials accompanying the 
president. 
  The South Korean president called on the Uzbekistan 
Government to prepare measures soon to expand cooperation in 
construction and various technologies while Karimov welcomed the 
request and promised to take the necessary steps, the officials 
said. 
  Welcoming the present state of active trading and 
joint-venture projects in some fields, the two presidents shared 
the view that the Agreements and Memoranda of Understanding 
(MOU) signed during Kim's visit will help boost bilateral 
exchanges in various areas, the officials said. 
  The agreements and MOUs signed during the past days cover 
aviation, culture, free passage, bioengineering and agricultural 
technology. 
  Expressing thanks to the Uzbekistan Government and its 
people 
for helping ethnic Koreans who were trying to resettle after 
being forcibly taken to Uzbekistan from the Russian Far East 
under the rule of Josef Stalin, Kim asked Uzbekistan to continue 
protecting the rights and interests of these Koreans, according 
to the officials. 
  In particular, Kim stressed that ethnic Koreans could play a 
role in building relations between the two countries, they said. 
  Karimov, meanwhile, emphasized that the 200,000 ethnic 
Koreans in Uzbekistan are proper citizens under Uzbekistani law 
and, therefore, will not be subjected to discrimination or 
unfair treatment under any circumstances, the officials said. 
  Uzbekistan's president praised ethnic Koreans for their role 
in developing the country and pointed out that some are serving 
as high-level officials including vice minister, according to 
the officials. 
  Kim and Karimov witnessed the signing of agreements on 
aviation and other fields before giving a joint new conference. 
  Kim was to leave for the Russian Far East city of Khabarovsk 
Monday afternoon after an official send-off ceremony at Tashkent 
airport, winding up his three-day state visit to Uzbekistan. 
  Kim will also visit Vladivostok and meet with Naval 
commanders at Russia's Pacific fleet headquartered in the 
Russian Far East city. While there, Kim will go on an 
observation tour of a submarine and other naval equipment before 
returning to Seoul late Tuesday.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Vladimir Nadashkevich </F>
and Vilor Niyazmatov] 
  [Text] Tashkent 5 June -- Uzbek President Islam Karimov 
called his South Korean counterpart Kim Young-sam to cooperate 
in promoting a peace settlement of the Tajik-Afghan conflict. 
  Speaking about prospects for bilateral relations during a 
reception in honor of the high guest, the Uzbek leader stressed 
that all preconditions for these ties had been created during 
the past two years. 
  Encouraging South Korean entrepreneurs to step up 
investments 
in Uzbekistan's key industries, Karimov described Uzbek cotton, 
gold, well-organized chemical and metallurgical industries as 
the best guarantee of their investments. The republic's 
president also belives that Uzbekistan and South Korea could 
closely cooperate in international political issues, for example 
to work for a nuclear- free status for the Central Asian region. 
  In his turn, the South Korean president said he believed in 
the great future of the newly-independent Uzbek state, which is 
to play a key role in Central Asia in the near future. 
  Speaking about over 200,000 ethnic Koreans living in 
Uzbekistan, Kim Young-sam thanked Uzbek people for their warm 
and hearty attitude towards his compatriots. Were it not for 
their assistance, the bitter fate of the Koreans deported from 
the Far East under Josef Stalin's order would have been even 
more tragic, the South Korean leader noted. He said he did not 
worry about his fellow-countrymen living in Uzbekistan.

  [Text] Tashkent, 5 June (YONHAP) -- China is expected not 
to exercise the veto when the U.N. Security Council resolves to 
impose sanctions on North Korea for its suspected nuclear 
safeguards violations, a ranking South Korean official 
accompanying President Kim Yong-sam on his tour of Uzbekistan 
said Sunday. 
  South Korea and related countries stand firmly for effective 
international sanctions against North Korea, he said, adding 
negotiations on the sanctions are under way among permanent U.N. 
Security Council member countries and related nations. 
  But full-dress negotiations on a draft U.N. Security Council 
resolution on the North Korean nuclear issue will start after 
President Kim returns to Seoul Tuesday, he said. 
  Senior presidential foreign affairs and security aide Chong 
Chong-uk said the government is maintaining close contact with 
the U.S. Government, while consulting with friendly nations 
about a number of measures to cope with the tension over North 
Korea's nuclear standoff. 
  The situation now is not worsening and there is no special 
development of the situation on the Korean peninsula, he added. 
  President Kim, receiving reports on the movements in Seoul 
and the United Nations in relation to the North Korean nuclear 
issue from Chong before his departure for Samarkand, told him to 
stay in Tashkent and have a thorough grasp of developments of 
the nuclear issue. Chong was to accompany Kim on his visit to 
the old Uzbek capital city. 
  While in Moscow and Tashkent, Kim was briefed by his aides 
on 
what was discussed in the Unification and Security Policy 
Coordination Council in Seoul and nuclear ambassador Kim 
Sam-hon's activities in Washington, Chong said.

  [Text] Yerevan ("HAYASTANI HANRAPETUTYUN" daily), 06/04/94 
-- A CSCE delegation, consisting of Colonel Heikki Happonen 
(Finland) and Piotr Iwaszkiewicz (Poland) arrived to Idzhevan on 
June 3. 
  Head of the delegation Happonen declared during the meeting 
with the Chairman of the Idzhevan District Council that the CSCE 
is ready to station observers in the conflict zone within a 
short period of time. 
  An observers point will be created in Idzhevan, and the 
delegation arrived to Ijevan to resolve corresponding technical 
problems. 
  According to Happonen, thanks to the efforts of CSCE, Russia 
and all other countries interested in peaceful regulation of the 
Karabakh conflict, the peace has never been as close as today. 
And failing its implementation today would mean causing a 
disaster to the whole region. 
  Colonel also declared that a similar delegation is currently 
working in Azerbaijan and, hopefully, the CSCE observers and CIS 
disengagement forces will be stationed along the whole Karabakh- 
Azeri front line.

<F P=106> [AZERTADZH report: "At the Center of Attention--Social </F>
Protection"] 
  [Text] Geydar Aliyev, president of Azerbaijan, has 
conducted a meeting devoted to questions of increased social 
protection for the population and a normalization of the 
financial situation of the republic's economy. Senior officials 
of the president's staff, the Supreme Council, and the Cabinet 
of Ministers and the leaders of ministries, state committees, 
companies, and banking and financial authorities took part in 
the meeting. 
  The meeting's opening remarks were delivered by Geydar 
Aliyev. 
  We are paying constant attention to the socioeconomic 
problems of the republic, the president observed, although we 
are having to devote a large amount of time to matters connected 
with the war. Sometimes, therefore, problems of the 
socioeconomic sphere are not being resolved quickly enough, at 
times, because the instructions that are issued are not 
fulfilled in good time. But we consider the solution of these 
questions a most important task and we will continue to work in 
earnest in this direction. The development of the socioeconomic 
sphere, Geydar Aliyev emphasized, is our strategic course and 
the path toward a strengthening of the country's independence 
and the increased well-being of the people. 
  Tasks of socioeconomic development are being tackled 
together 
with the shaping of a free market economy and the creation of 
extensive opportunities for enterprise and business initiative, 
the president went on to say, and the measures that are being 
adopted are designed, primarily, to serve the interests of the 
people and are targeted at an improvement in the social position 
of all strata of the population. 
  Having announced that the leadership of the republic was 
preparing for the implementation of a number of steps in this 
direction, Geydar Aliyev expressed the opinion that they should 
be discussed in advance and invited the participants in the 
meeting to embark on this discussion. 
  Vakhid Akhundov, state counselor for economic policy, 
described the principal measures that it was planned 
implementing for a resolution of problems of the socioeconomic 
sphere and familiarized the participants in the meeting with a 
draft presidential edict that had been prepared in this 
connection. 
  Rasul Guliyev, chairman of the Supreme Council, Fikret 
Yusifov, first deputy minister of finance, Tofik Azizov, 
chairman of the Commission of the Supreme Council for Economic 
Policy and general director of the Nord Research-Production 
Association, Abdulla Melikaslanov, deputy president of the 
National Bank, Chingiz Abdullayev, chairman of the board of the 
Azerigazbank Industrial- Investment Bank, Rovshan Mustafayev, 
rector of the Azerbaijan Constitutional Development and 
International Relations Institute, Shokhret Vekilov, chief of 
the Republic State Main Tax Inspectorate, Sayad Ibragimov, vice 
president of the Azerbaijani Republic GNK [State Petroleum 
Company], Prime Minister Suret Guseynov, Fazail Agamaliyev, 
minister of labor and social protection of the populace, and 
Asaf Nadirov, academic secretary of the Academy of Sciences, 
took part in the discussion. 
  There was a wide-ranging exchange of opinions on the ways to 
lower social tension and normalize the financial situation. It 
was observed that whereas prices grew in the year approximately 
14-fold, wages grew on average by a factor of 4.4. The 
interruptions in the supply to the populace of bread and fuel 
were discussed, and the opinion that a negative influence on the 
state of affairs in the baking industry was being exerted by the 
current big difference in the price of flour and the finished 
product was expressed. The situation in the petroleum industry 
has become extremely complicated, and the sector's debts have 
risen by 10 billion manat. 
  The participants in the meeting agreed with the need for the 
adoption of urgent measures to rectify the current situation. It 
is necessary first and foremost, the speakers emphasized, to 
increase the minimum wage and pensions paid to nonworking 
retirees and the grants to students and trainees of 
vocational-technical schools, to make provision for the payment 
of supplementary compensation from the resources of the republic 
budget for families whose per capita monthly income does not 
exceed double the minimum wage, and to raise the price of bread 
and energy, which should, in addition, be revised at least 
quarterly and brought into line with the rate of inflation. 
  Proposals were heard concerning the suspension prior to the 
end of the year of the construction of publicly funded 
facilities, the cancellation of the decisions adopted earlier on 
the allocation of soft loans to state-owned enterprises and 
organizations, a reduction in the number of central organs of 
administration and their employees, and a cutback on 
administrative-managerial costs. It was proposed also to make 
provision for the government's issue and sale of the requisite 
quantity of securities in order to partially cover the budget 
deficit and to switch from a tax-free system and tax exemptions 
for individual categories of individuals and legal entities to a 
system of payments of monetary compensation to the socially 
unprotected strata of the populace. 
  Speaking of other measures pertaining to a solution of the 
questions discussed, the participants in the meeting noted the 
importance of increased supervision of the pricing of the 
products and services of state-owned enterprises and 
organizations, the need for an audit of the resources of the 
entrepreneurs and other resources invested by state-owned 
enterprises in the private sector, the establishment of a 
precise delineation between republic and local budgets, and so 
forth. 
  In the opinion of a number of speakers, a rise in the 
minimum 
wage not only would not lower but would, on the contrary, 
increase the rate of inflation. To reduce it it is essential to 
saturate the consumer market either by increasing production or, 
temporarily, thanks to credit resources, thereby creating real 
conditions for a lowering of prices. 
  Having dwelt on questions connected with a normalization of 
the financial situation, the participants in the meeting 
observed that the criminal machinations and exaggerations in 
determination of the price of the dollar perpetrated by a number 
of private banks are serious destabilizing factors in this 
sphere. The president of Azerbaijan gave the necessary 
instructions in this connection. 
  Having considered the proposed draft presidential edict, the 
participants in the meetings were of the opinion that it should 
be reworked with the participation of scientists and specialists. 
  The meeting was summed up by Geydar Aliyev, president of 
Azerbaijan, who delivered an important speech. 
  Afiyaddin Dzhalilov, deputy chairman of the Supreme Council, 
Fuad Guliyev, first deputy prime minister, State Counselors Arif 
Ragimzade, Gabil Guseynli, and Idayat Orudzhev, Deputy Prime 
Ministers Samed Sadykhov, Elchin Efendiyev, and Asker Mamedov, 
and Rafael Allakhverdiyev, chief of the executive of the city of 
Baku, took part in the meeting.

  [Text] [Announcer] The Russian Federation Council decision 
not to send peacekeeping forces to the Georgian-Abkhazian 
conflict zone did not go down well in Georgia or in Abkhazia. 
But Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze hopes for a positive 
outcome. 
  [Unidentified Correspondent] The unexpected complications in 
the Russian leadership over deploying peacekeeping forces in the 
Georgian- Abkhazian conflict zone evoked an equivocal reaction 
in Georgia. The opposition to the Georgian leadership, which 
thinks that Russia has no interest in stability in its southern 
neighbor, discerns in this a confirmation of Russia's 
unreliability as a partner. In particular, followers of Former 
President Zviad Gamsakhurdia, demonstrating outside the UN 
representation in Tbilisi against the presence of Russian troops 
in Georgia, organized a protest action against the introduction 
of Russian troops as peacekeepers in the Georgian-Abkhazian 
conflict zone. 
  The latest complications worry the Georgian leader as well. 
Eduard Shevardnadze had a telephone conversation with Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin on the subject today. In an exclusive 
interview for the Today program, Eduard Shevardnadze said: 
  [Begin Shevardnadze recording] At this point doing anything 
in contradiction to what has been agreed, on which agreement has 
been reached at all levels, would be irrational and unwarranted. 
It seems to me there was no prior explanation. Then, I think 
the Russian leadership understands that a swift settlement of 
the conflict is not only in the interests of Georgia, but of 
Russia as well. An unstable Abkhazia, and an unstable Georgia 
as a whole, are indisputably not conducive to establishing peace 
and order in the North Caucasus. So this is evidently a 
temporary phenomenon, and in a few days I think another decision 
will be made, one that will be conducive to settling the 
conflict. [end recording]

  [Text] According to information passed to KONTAKT news 
agency by the press service of the Georgian Defense Ministry, 
Georgian Defense Minister Vardiko Nadibaidze met Teodor 
Starcevic, head of the UN mission in Georgia, and Brigadier 
General Hvidegaard, head of the UN observers in Georgia, who had 
been in Abkhazia since the beginning of the month [as heard]. 
The meeting was attended by Mr Sandro Kavsadze, chairman of the 
committee for human rights and ethnic relations, and Nodar 
Tatarashvili, chief of general staff and first deputy defense 
minister. 
  Mr Hvidegaard expressed an interest in problems pertaining 
to 
the deployment of peacekeeping forces in Abkhazia, their number, 
and the location of their stationing. In addition, he 
acquainted the minister with the mandate of the UN mission about 
which he had talked with Mr Sandro Kavsadze. The presented 
draft mandate stipulates the control over the activities of 
peacekeeping forces and the cases of violation of the agreement 
as well as close relations with units of the peacekeeping 
troops. However, according to Mr Hvidegaard, the UN mission and 
the CIS peacekeeping forces will not interfere in each other's 
functions. 
  The minister thanked the guests for the visit and emphasized 
the urgency of the arrival of peacekeeping forces in the 
conflict zone in order to secure the establishment of peace in 
the region. As for the number and location of the peacekeeping 
forces, this issue is being discussed in Moscow, where the 
deputy minister, Guram Nikolaishvili is at the moment. 
  Speaking about the mandate, the minister said most of its 
paragraphs were acceptable for him. He also emphasized that 
cooperation between the UN observers and the international 
peacekeeping forces played a decisive role in the settlement of 
the conflict. He promised the visitors actual assistance in 
handling their problems.

  [Text] A Georgian Information Agency correspondent has 
learned from competent sources that a meeting was held in 
Chkhorotsku yesterday between voters and a candidate 
representing the Traditionalists' Union. 
  About 70 voters attended the meeting, which was addressed by 
Akaki Asatiani, chairman of the Traditionalists' Union. He used 
offensive terms when referring to the policy of the present 
government, to Eduard Shevardnadze, and to rayon police 
employees, whom he called traitors because they served the 
authorities. 
  This prompted a negative reaction from participants in the 
meeting. A large proportion of them left the building in 
protest following a heated argument and oral exchange. After a 
short while, a group of outraged citizens moved toward the 
building while the visitors were still there. In order to avoid 
a serious incident, the police fired several warning shots in 
the air. The chairman of the Traditionalists' Union and union 
members were forced to leave the building and then the rayon. 
  Criminal proceedings have been instituted in connection with 
the incident. An investigation is under way.

issue for 28 May - 4 Jun] 
  [Text] Tbilisi -- A protocol has been signed between 
Georgia and Russia on establishment of coordination center aimed 
to distribute the financial and material aid. The decision was 
assumed to realize the last-year September 14 agreement "On 
economic reconstruction of region in the zone of 
Georgian-Ossetian conflict". 
  However, as SNARK reporter was told in the International 
Economic Relations Department of Georgian Foreign Ministry, the 
Russian side has not yet allocated the 5b rubles promised for 
reconstruction. Also the decision on Russian 20b credit to 
Georgia for 1994 has not been made yet, though the corresponding 
agreement was reached during Boris Yeltsin's visit to Georgia. 
Russian side, the department says, puts forward the requirement 
that Georgia should liquidate the 10b debt by credits granted to 
her last year.

<F P=106> ["Status report on the Withdrawal of Russian Troops From </F>
Estonia" dated 1 June 1994, based on data provided by Estonian 
Ministry of Defense and the Defense Forces Headquarters -- 
received via Internet E-LIST] 
  [Text] During May 1994, no significant changes occurred in 
the infrastructure and composition of the Russian troops located 
in Estonia. At the same time the situation of the withdrawal of 
the troops has become very complicated and contradictory. On 
one hand the Russian authorities are trying to do everything to 
maintain their military presence in Estonia while on the other 
hand a very slow withdrawal process is still going on 
simultaneously. 
  In order to maintain its military presence, the Russian side 
has further strengthened its attempts to relate the withdrawal 
of the troops with other issues, for example the granting of 
special rights to military pensioners and enhancing the 
accusations against Estonia of the alleged violence of human 
rights. While still avoiding the announcement of the deadline 
and timetable of the withdrawal of its troops, the Russian side 
is trying to accuse Estonia of the failure in Estonian-Russian 
negotiations so far. Russia is still presenting claims which 
can only be interpreted as interference into the internal 
affairs of the Republic of Estonia (the Law on Citizenship, the 
Language Law etc.). All this prevents the establishment of the 
good-neighbourly relations between the two states and confirms 
that in the political life of Russia, imperial ambitions to 
restore the sphere of influence of the former Soviet Union still 
play a very important role. 
  During May the Estonian side was able to take over only 3 
objects: the depots in Arukuela in Harju county which formerly 
belonged to the navy, the depot of the boatswain's equipment at 
6 Lootsi Street and the supply depot at 14 Lootsi Street in 
Tallinn. 
  According to available information, preparations for 
transfer 
are going on at 13 objects in all, the transfer of which is 
planned for June. Among these, Naissaar where all the sea mines 
are either destroyed or withdrawn, and the former garrison of 
the radio intelligence station of the National Security 
Committee in Harju county in Vana-Aaviku should be noted. 
  In the navy ammunition and explosives depot located next to 
residential area of Rhoismaee in Tallinn, which was visited by 
Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs representatives and the 
special commission of the Tallinn Rescue Service, only 1,000 
tons out of the former 5,500 tons of ammunition is left. 20-25 
wagons would suffice for removing the remainder. 
  The Russian Army still holds 114 sites and single objects in 
the territory of Estonia. 86 of these are in Tallinn and 28 in 
Harju County. The largest of these are described below. 
  In land forces: The 144th motorized rifle division. 
Personnel estimated at about 1,000 men of whom about 700 are 
officers and ensigns. Besides that, the officers who have 
remained behind from the troops already withdrawn as well as the 
re-enlisted military men are also accounted to the personnel of 
this division. The regular soldiers leaving the division are 
being replaced by Russian citizens living in Estonia. In 
addition, Russian citizens from both Estonia and Russia who have 
already finished their service, as well as unemployed officers 
and re-enlisted military men are serving in the division as 
sergeants and soldiers on a contractual basis. The wives of 
officers have been employed in offices and logistical jobs. 
  The main duty of the motorized rifle regiment of Klooga is 
the defence of Aemari airport. Because of that, the armament -- 
the armoured personnel carriers -- has not yet been taken away. 
The regiment may leave after the transfer of the airport to 
Estonia. 
  In naval forces: 
  In the Russian naval units in Tallinn, Paldiski, Aemari and 
elsewhere in Harju county there are about 1,400 - 1,500 military 
men in all. At Tallinn naval base there still remain the 
headquarters, the headquarters of the 94th mine sweepers' 
brigade in the Mine Harbour, the 55th mine sweepers' unit (2 
mine sweepers) and logistical units. On the whole, there are 
still about 400 seamen in Tallinn. As most of the officers and 
other military men are not in uniform while on the territory of 
Russian military objects, it has become difficult to determine 
their exact number. 
  At the 93rd naval training centre of Paldiski there are 
currently about 890 and at Aemari airport 100 - 150 Russian 
military men. About 100 men serve in several smaller service and 
logistical units and depots. 
  On the whole, about 2,400-2,500 military men are serving in 
the military units of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation 
located on the territory of Estonia. In addition, it is 
estimated that about 500-1,000 have been demobilized or left 
behind in Estonia. 
  Work on the dismantlement of the Paldiski nuclear reactors, 
which, during the negotiations was planned for the beginning of 
April, has been practically stopped by the Russian side. 
Apparently experts and medical workers have been given leave 
until July. If this is true, the withdrawal of the fuel rods 
will not be carried out before July. 
  There are only 92 days left before the final deadline of the 
withdrawal of the Russian troops proposed by Russia -- August 31 
this year. Considering the number of the remaining troops and 
the lack of technical obstacles, complete withdrawal by this 
date is still possible. In the present situation where the 
ships, technology and equipment of the naval forces are being 
withdrawn more or less constantly, but the withdrawal of the 
144th motorized rifle division is being delayed, one could 
suppose that the intent is to delay the withdrawal of these 
units with their armament and equipment up to the last moment in 
order to get more concessions from Estonia. It is also possible 
that some military objects might not be transferred to Estonian 
control by August 31 although the armament will be removed. A 
positive conclusion still depends greatly on active support for 
Estonia from other nations and international organizations.

  [Text] President Lennart Meri has said that establishing 
lasting good-neighborly relations with Russia is one of the key 
priorities in Estonia's foreign policy. The president also 
emphasizes the need to resolve all problems between the two 
states through political means, in talks around a table. 
  According to the president, the exchange of ideas which took 
place in Geneva between Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy 
Churkin and Raul Malk, deputy chancellor of the Estonian Foreign 
Ministry, demonstrate a willingness to seek a mutually 
satisfactory solution through talks. The elimination of the 
last vestiges of World War II on 31 August not only presupposes 
the withdrawal of Russian troops from the former East Germany 
but also from Estonia and Latvia, President Lennart Meri says. 
  The Estonian president was prompted to explain Estonia's 
foreign policy by remarks made at a news conference on Saturday 
[4 June] by Major General Aleksander Einseln, the commander of 
defense forces. Einseln said on Saturday that the Estonian 
defense forces are capable of forcibly driving out the Russian 
military units deployed here. According to the president, any 
practical solutions about a prompt and unconditional withdrawal 
from Estonian territory by Russian troops will proceed from 
Estonian legislation and from decrees and instructions of the 
Estonian Government. 
  This has been reported by the BALTIC NEWS SERVICE agency.

  [Text] Sevastopol 3 June TASS -- Military experts are 
completing lists of ships of the Black Sea Fleet to be divided 
between Russia and Ukraine, journalists learned although no 
official reports for the media are available. 
  The talks between Russian and Ukrainian military experts 
which have been going on for three days, were attended today by 
Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Tarasyuk, Vice-Premier 
Valeriy Shmarov and Deputy Ukrainian Defence Minister Ivan 
Bizhan, who arrived in Sevastopol on Friday to take part in the 
work of groups of military experts. 
  As for the division of naval bases and coastal 
infrastructure,the sides have been outlining their positions 
yet. These problems are expected to be high on the agenda of 
talks scheduled in Kiev on 8-9 June. 
  Yuriy Dubinin, special envoy of the Russian Foreign 
Ministry, 
has failed to arrive in Sevastopol today for unknown reasons, 
although he had been expected since yesterday. However, 
problems of the location of the fleets' bases are not likely to 
be discussed in Sevastopol without representatives of the 
Russian Government.

  [Text] The Russian fleet will definitely be located in 
Sevastopol. However, it is necessary to draw up the legal basis 
for this, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov told 
an INTERFAX-UKRAINA correspondent in Sevastopol, commenting on 
the results of a meeting between a Ukrainian governmental 
delegation and a delegation of Russian experts on the division 
of the Black Sea Fleet. 
  It is planned that the intergovernmental talks on the 
division of the fleet will be resumed in Kiev on 8 June. 
  The Ukrainian governmental delegation today left for 
Nikolayev, where it will visit the missile cruiser Ukraina, 
which is under construction there. It is expected that the 
cruiser, which will become part of the Ukrainian Navy, will be 
launched later this year.

  [Text] "I am in favor of economic union with Russia, on 
which we depend so much for energy supplies and a market," the 
presidential candidate and co-chairman of the Interregional 
Reform Alliance Leonid Kuchma told a press conference in Odessa. 
  He said "the non-competitive production of Ukrainian 
enterprises has so far found a market only in the eastern 
republics of the former USSR." However, he said "Ukrainian 
industry is in dire need of western technology, something which 
Russia is unable to give us." 
  Kuchma was convinced that Ukraine needed a strong centrist 
party for the Ukrainian president to lean on. "One possible 
basis" was his own Interregional Reform Alliance, he said. 
  Kuchma believes that only well-versed economists could put 
Ukraine's economic mess right. "I see no one to fit the bill 
among potential future prime ministers," he said. 
  Regarding the situation in Crimea, Kuchma pointed out that 
separatist moods on the peninsula could have been warned 
earlier, without creating a precedent for their encouragement. 
He said that the regions must be given broad economic stability 
rather than political independence. 
  "The Black Sea Fleet is a constant source of tension in 
Crimea," Kuchma commented. "The fleet must be leased in its 
entirety to Russia and the proceeds used to buy Russian oil and 
gas...Ukraine does not need such a huge or, for that matter, 
decrepit fleet," the presidential candidate said.

Mikhail Melnik] 
  [Text] Kiev 3 June TASS -- Delegations from Russia and 
Ukraine are holding talks in Kiev today on the settlement of 
Ukraine's debt to Russia for supplied gas. 
  Chairman of the Ukrainian State Committee for Gas and Oil 
Supplies, Mikhail Kovalko, said that this year, Ukraine already 
owes the Russian Gasprom joint stock society a considerable sum 
of money in hard currency. The overall debt has been estimated 
at $850 million. "Today's talks with our Russian partners are 
very important," Kovalko said. The sides are expected to look 
into political problems connected with the further development 
of gas pipe line systems in Russia and Ukraine and an increase 
in exports of Russian gas to countries of Western Europe, 
Kovalko said. 
  "Chairman of the board of the Gasprom joint stock society, 
Rem Vyakhirev, told ITAR-TASS that they regard financial 
difficulties faced by their Ukrainian colleagues with 
understanding. Vyakhirev said that they approved of Ukraine's 
proposal to repay part of the debt at the expense of 
construction of houses for Gasprom workers in Russia. "Today, 
we intend to discuss the terms of construction and evaluate its 
cost," Vyakhirev said. "We are also interested in a more 
efficient use of Ukraine's gas pipe line system for exports of 
Russian gas to Western countries," Vyakhirev said. 
  Later in the day, the sides are expected to sign a contract 
on further cooperation in this field.

  [Text] Kiev -- Two-day talks between the delegations of the 
Russian joint stock company Gazprom and Ukraine's gas industry 
and government officials ended on 4 June. A schedule for the 
Ukrainian consumers to service their debt for Russian gas was 
agreed. An accord was reached on creating favorable conditions 
for contracts for gas deliveries to be concluded directly by 
Ukraine's enterprises and Russia's Gazprom, as well as on 
commercial firms participating in the settlement of the debt. 
An agreement was signed on cooperation in expanding and 
revamping transit gas pipelines in Ukraine. To that end, a 
joint stock venture is to be set up by the end of this year. 
Agreement was reached on the transfer of 15 to 30 percent of 
the shares in Odessa's port works to the Russian joint stock 
company Gazprom as authorized by Ukraine's State Property Fund.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: By correspondents </F>
Igor Porshnev and Vitaly Trubetskoy] 
  [Text] The issue of Ukraine joining the Non-Proliferation 
Treaty is not of great urgency, believes one of the closest 
advisers of President Leonid Kravchuk. 
  "At present, the Ukrainian parliament must first of all 
consider economic issues," leader of the presidential service on 
foreign policy Anton Buteiko declared in his interview with the 
agency INTERFAX-Ukraine Thursday [2 June]. 
  In his opinion, "Kiev fulfills the treaty's demands striving 
for a non-nuclear status" without joining the NPT Treaty. 
  On 1 June Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk submitted a 
draft decree on Ukraine joining the NPT Treat to the parliament 
for consideration. According to the project, "presence of 
nuclear weapons on the Ukrainian territory till its complete 
destruction does not contradict the Treaty." 
  In addition, Kiev intends to view "the violation of the 
territorial integrity and inviolability of its border on the 
part of any nuclear state" as a violation of the NPT 
[Non-Proliferation] Treaty. 
  Kravchuk is once more addressing the parliament with a 
proposal to join the treaty. On 3 February this year Ukraine's 
parliament expressed its intention to consider this problem in 
the future.

  [Text] Kiev [no dateline as received] -- Today, experts 
from the European Union's [EU] Technical Aid Program to CIS 
Countries (TACIS) held a news conference on assistance to 
Ukraine in agricultural production and food distribution. 
  Under the TACIS program, a total of 150 million ECU 
[European 
currency unit] has been provided for Ukraine since 1991. It was 
agriculture, however, that Luis Moreno, EU ambassador to 
Ukraine, described as a priority aspect of the program that 
mostly deals with consultative and technical assistance. Around 
100 million ECU worth of food will be given to Ukraine. Luis 
Moreno expressed the hope that the volume of agricultural 
production in Ukraine will, in 10 years, be the second largest 
in Europe. 
  EU experts Stuart Lisor and Patrik Pyusemye spoke about the 
implementation in various areas of Ukraine of aid programs to 
modernize the infrastructure of baby food manufacture and 
production of meat, milk, vegetables, fruit, animal feed, the 
improvement of wholesale and retail food distribution, and the 
privatization of food stores.

<F P=106> [Nikita Gololobov report in the "Power" column: "The Battle </F>
of Giants in the Capital. Rivalry Between Russia's Premier and 
Moscow's Mayor Grows More Acute"] 
  [Text] The rivalry between the clans of Viktor 
Chernomyrdin and Yuriy Luzhkov, which has until recently 
proceeded "under the carpet," has now, as analysts predicted, 
come out into the open, with appeals to the president and the 
enlisting of the prosecutor's office, the press, and electronic 
media. 
  The rivalry has been simmering for a long time. Yuriy 
Luzhkov and the Moscow government, unhappy over their share of 
revenues from the privatization of enterprises according to 
federal laws and over what they see as infringement of the 
Moscow administration's powers, have sharply attacked 
"Chubays-style" privatization. Furthermore, Yuriy Luzhkov has 
sought and obtained from Boris Yeltsin a special status for 
Moscow and its government. Federal government resolutions have 
virtually no effect on the territory of the capital, and it has 
been accorded substantial tax breaks. 
  The nature of the Moscow mayor's influence on the president 
is evident: Boris Yeltsin's political and power support is 
based mainly in the capital, and the Kremlin, as is known, is 
also located in Moscow. 
  Seeing such a strengthening of his rival's positions, the 
government chairman, unhappy with the special status of the 
Moscow "baron," as a warning to other regions supported Anatoliy 
Chubays in his duel with Yuriy Luzhkov. In response, several 
Moscow papers ran publications about Viktor Chernomyrdin's close 
associate, Oleg Soskovets, accusing the latter of corruption in 
privatizing the Novosibirsk tin plant and other metallurgical 
enterprises. Viktor Chernomyrdin, for his part, organized an 
inspection of Most-bank's performance, which began in early May. 
The prosecutor's office has already started examination of the 
letter by Vice Premier Anatoliy Chubays alleging gross 
violations of privatization laws by the mayor and the Moscow 
city government. Yuriy Luzhkov took countermeasures. According 
to information in our possession, before the premier went on a 
two-week vacation, Luzhkov had a "no-holds-barred" conversation 
with him. It is not ruled out that prior to that he had 
enlisted the president's support. 
  What matters here, however, are not privatization methods. 
Yuriy Luzhkov, just like all representatives of regional 
elites, is unhappy with at least two features of the 
"Chubays-style" privatization. First, as a result of 
enterprises and factories being sold off, they lose control of a 
substantial part of real estate located on their territory 
without getting anything in exchange. Second, privatization of 
large enterprises will lead to a change in the traditional 
methods of management and possibly provoke discontent among the 
population which has not yet become accustomed to its fate being 
decided by a private owner. 
  The Kremlin seems to be watching with satisfaction the 
mutual 
weakening of these two powerful groupings and the discrediting 
of their leaders. 
  In this situation, politicians conduct themselves 
differently. 
  Vice Premier Sergey Shakhray, as an experienced politician, 
calculating various options for a long term, has recently sought 
not to mar relations with the Yuriy Luzhkov group in order to 
retain his political positions in the event of Viktor 
Chernomyrdin's resignation. 
  Yuriy Skokov, Russian Commodity Producers Federation 
chairman, who, according to many observers, is the main 
candidate for the post of premier -- if it is vacated -- 
retaining the reputation as a man unblemished in the process 
popularly stigmatized as "piratization" ["prikhvatizatsiya"], is 
trying to avoid any intriguing either against Viktor 
Chernomyrdin or Yuriy Luzhkov. 
  It is not ruled out that the first results of the "battle of 
giants" will not be long in coming. According to a source in 
the Moscow mayoral entourage, we shall learn about some serious 
cadre reshuffles before Viktor Chernomyrdin returns from his 
vacation.

  [Text] The Federation Council ought to ratify the treaty on 
the CIS Economic Union of 24 September 1993 as this is in 
Russia's interests, the upper chamber of the Russian Parliament 
was advised at hearings Friday. 
  The Russian Government was advised to step up efforts to 
create a free trade area and customs and payments unions in the 
CIS. 
  Federation Council members said that industrial decline 
throughout the CIS was due largely to the break up of economic 
links. 
  The CIS Statistics Committee said that overall economic 
decline in the Commonwealth was characterized by a reduction of 
the gross domestic product on the whole in the CIS by 26% 
over 
the past two years, including by 30% in industry and 
11% in 
agriculture. 
  The Statistics Committee said that industrial output had 
gone 
down by 10-18% in Ukraine, Belarus and Turkmenistan since 
1991, 
24-31% in Russia, Moldova, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan and 
39-60% in Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia and Georgia. 
  Sergey Glazyev, who is chairman of the State Duma (lower 
chamber of parliament) Committee for Economic Policy, told the 
Federation Council that the Free Trade Agreement signed on 15 
April this year must be put into effect, all the more so because 
of its benefit for Russia. The CIS market accounted for one 
fifth of Russia's foreign market and it was in the former USSR 
states that Russian goods were most competitive, he said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Aleksandr Krylovich] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 3 TASS -- Russian and Kazakh Foreign 
Ministers Andrey Kozyrev and Kanat Saudabayev who held talks in 
Moscow on Friday, concentrated on how to speed up the 
implementation of agreements reached by the Russian and Kazakh 
presidents, including the citizenship issue. 
  Saudabayev, who was appointed to this post last April, 
visits 
Moscow in this capacity for the first time. 
  According to the Russian foreign minister, the 
implementation 
of agreements reached during Kazakh President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev's visit to Russia last March has been unjustifiably 
delayed, which provokes "some concern". 
  ITAR-TASS learnt from reliable sources that the matter in 
question is deepening and specification of 20 agreements. 
  The main of them are the treaty of deepening economic 
cooperation, the treaty of military cooperation, the agreement 
on terms of using and leasing the Baykonur Cosmodrome as well as 
the memorandum on the basic principles questions on citizenship 
and legal status of Russian and Kazakh citizens. 
  The sides will also have to prepare the first official visit 
to Kazakhstan by Russian President Boris Yeltsin. According to 
information received by ITAR-TASS, its specific period has not 
been set and will be discussed "at a diplomatic level". 
  On Thursday, the Kazakh side handed over several draft 
documents on which work will be conducted, taking into account 
results of the present ministerial meeting. These documents 
include a draft agreement on a legal status of citizens which is 
of special concern for the Russian side. 
  The Russian side received on Friday draft agreements on 
simplified procedure of obtaining citizenship, procedure of 
military service and cooperation on labour migration. A working 
group set up today will be occupied with their final wording. 
  In the opinion of a high-ranking official of the Russian 
Foreign Ministry, the present exchange of opinions "will enable 
the two sides to remove dissatisfaction caused by the 
insufficiently quick implementation of the understandings 
between the presidents".

  [Text] Chechnya claims that "the Russian leadership is 
virtually ready for an armed aggression against the republic." 
A statement by Chechnya's State Security Department says that 
it is with this aim that Russia is redeploying its troops around 
the republic. 
  According to Groznyy, an elite Russian air assault unit has 
taken up position at Mozdok (North Ossetia). Russian Interior 
Ministry special troops are reported to be moving toward the 
Chechen borders following Moscow's decision to extend the state 
of emergency to the zone of Ossetian-Ingush conflict.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] Vyacheslav Kebich, one of the six contestants to the 
presidency at elections on 23 June, has outlined at a meeting 
with workers of the Minsk margarine factory five basic 
principles he intends to follow if he wins: 
  -- A mutually advantageous union with Russia, and 
prospectively - an alliance of the three Slav states; 
  -- The building of an independent Belarusian state through 
economic expansion and the restoration of broken ties; 
  -- Market relations through economic reform with producers 
rather than brokers at the center; 
  -- Merciless fight against crime and corruption; 
  -- The spread of Christian morality and such Belarusian 
moral 
values as diligence, kindness, mutual respect, and restraint. 
  As Kebich emphasized, "a reliable, firm, and equal union 
with 
Russia is the goal of the policy I pursue." In his words, "the 
first nine points of a treaty "on the unification of the 
monetary systems of Belarus and Russia" have already taken 
effect. [quotation marks as received] "The abolition of custom 
duties alone has dropped the prices of Belarussian TV sets and 
fridges by 15-20 percent. This means that these goods will be 
increasingly pervading the Russian and other markets, and 
profits and state revenues will go up," he said. 
  Custom-free bilateral trade has brought the tariffs on fuel 
from Russia down as of 1 June. As Kebich disclosed at a meeting 
with Minsk tube builders recently, "one tonne of oil purchased 
in Russia will cost much less than the $85 the Republic pays for 
it today." In his words, "the price of Russian fuel will be 
formed thus: The world price minus a 40 percent custom duty." 
IF Note: The Russian-Belarusian Monetary Integration Agreement 
provided for such a trade status as of 1 May. However, it has 
actually been in effect only since 1 June. 
  According to a poll by Eridan, a republican center for 
political studies, Kebich's popularity as a candidate to the 
presidential office has doubled in the last six weeks. He tops 
the list of officially registered contestants with 372,000 
signatures in his support. (Down at the bottom is ex-speaker 
Stanislav Shushkevich with 123,000 signatures, and the leader of 
the Agrarian Party Aleksndr Dubko with 117,000 signatures -- IF). 
  The popularity of other candidates, among them the former 
leader of the Interim Parliamentary Anticorruption Commission 
Aleksandr Lukashenko, the Communist Party's Secretary Vasiliy 
Novikov, and Dubko has risen since April from two to four 
percent while Shushkevich's rating has shrunk from nearly 10 
down to seven percent and that of the Popular Front's leader 
Zenon Poznyak has dwindled from 5 to 4 percent. 
  Nearly 60 percent of respondents favour monetary integration 
with Russia, and more than 77 percent would welcome a fiscal 
union with Russia.

collaboration in the fields of culture, transportation, 
agriculture, crime control, etc. The main document to be signed

they discussed the changes in the political life of the region 
and stressed the necessity of nurturing democratic processes in 
the newly independent states as a factor facilitating the 
consolidation of their independence. Mircea Snegur asserted 
that after the multi-party elevations, which designated a 
parliamentary majority, and the opinion poll "La Sfat Cu 
Poporul" ["Consulting the People"], at which the population 
voted for independence, the stability is growing more evident. 
It was also mentioned that it is possible that a special 
juridical status for the Gagauz regions will be adopted before 
the parliamentary vacation. it is much more difficult to 
eliminate the consequences of the Dniester conflict, but in this 
case only political steps will be undertaken as well said Mircea 
Snegur. President Demirel said that he hopes that the Treaty of 
Friendship and Collaboration which will be signed during the 
visit will lead to the achievement of the goals toward which 
both sides aspire. In this context it is vitally important to 
comply with the Declaration of Economic Cooperation of the Black 
Sea basin states, which is committed to an expansion and 
diversification of economic relations among the countries of 
this region. Demirel also affirmed that the Gagauz population 
"will have a good reputation" if it respects the laws and the 
territorial integrity of Moldova. "We are willing to offer the 
Gagauzians cultural and economic assistance in order to raise 
their standards of life as devoted citizens of the Republic of 
Moldova," concluded Demirel.

section of the border between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Our 
correspondent has the details: 
  [Unidentified correspondent] The press service of Armenia's 
Defense Ministry says that on the night of 4 June, a motorized 
infantry battalion of the Azerbaijani Army, supported by armored 
vehicles, attacked positions of Armenia's territorial defense 
forces close to the village of (Davik) in Noyemberyansiky rayon. 
Azerbaijani sub-units managed to move onto Armenian territory 
and even to progress toward the rayon center of Noyemberyan. 
However, after a regrouping of forces and the arrival of 
reinforcements, the aggressor was beaten back to its original 
positions. Azerbaijan's Army lost around one infantry platoon 
[as heard] and one infantry combat vehicle. The Armenian losses 
are not yet known.

  [Text] A Georgian military working group involved in 
bilateral talks in Moscow on the Abkhazian conflict has returned 
to Tbilisi. The group included General Guram Nikolaishvili and 
General Gia Vashakidze, Georgian deputy defense ministers; and 
Vladimer Chikonani, the commander of the Georgian interior 
troops. Jaba Ioseliani, the head of state's representative, led 
the group. 
  In accordance with the document of 14 May on a cease-fire 
and 
the disengagement of forces, the participants in the Moscow 
talks carried out the precise delineation of the peacekeeping 
troops' deployment areas and marked these on the map. 
  At the first stage of conflict settlement, peacekeeping 
forces will enter and take control of an area which is 78 km 
long, between [placename indistinct] and Ochamchire, and 56 km 
wide, between Tkvarcheli and (Atskura). Thirty control posts 
and five checkpoints will be set up and four mobile groups will 
be deployed throughout this territory. The headquarters of the 
joint command will be in Sukhumi. The UN representatives who 
are now working in the area as observers will be attached to the 
peacekeeping forces deployed in the area. 
  The peacekeeping force will include troops from the Russian 
Federation's Leningrad, Volga, and Ural military districts. 
These troops will start entering their areas of deployment from 
next week. Later, CIS peacekeeping forces will also be 
introduced. 
  It should be noted that the leaders of almost all CIS 
countries have supported the decision to deploy peacekeepers. 
  As Vladimer Chikovani pointed out, it is now difficult to 
speak of the so-called buffer zone any more, since the 
peacekeeping forces will enter and take control not only of a 
(?strip) along the Inguri river but also of an area of 2,184 
square km around Gali. The area will include such large places 
as the towns of Gali and Tkvarcheli, and the villages of Zemo 
Okumi, Kvemo Okumi, Ghumurishi, Saberio, Sabedao, Otobaia, and 
Achigvara. 
  In answering our correspondent's question about the safety 
of 
returning refugees, Mr. Chikovani said that good working 
conditions have been created for the UNHCR and that the 
peacekeeping forces are legally entitled and have the ability to 
control the situation in any settlement in the Gali region. 
  Generals Aleksandr Sokolov, Yuriy Kozlov, and Aleksey Khapin 
represented Russia in the working group. The Abkhaz delegation 
included Anri Jergenaia, Ardzinba's personal representative and 
brother-in-law, as well as Sergey Dabar and Sultan Soslaniyev.

  [Text] Sevastopol [no date as received] -- Ukrainian and 
Russian expert working groups, led by Ukrainian Deputy Prime 
Minister Valeriy Shmarov and Feliks Gromov, the Russian navy 
commander in chief, met here on 3 June. At the meeting, the 
work of the experts on a final resolution of the Black Sea Fleet 
problem, which is to be achieved at a meeting in Kiev on 8-9 
June, is being discussed. The Ukrainian delegation, including 
heads of the Ministries of Internal Affairs, Defense, and 
Foreign Affairs, the state property fund, and the Ministry of 
Economy, also plans to discuss Sevastopol's social and economic 
problems with the local authorities. 
  At the start of the meeting, Valeriy Shmarov stressed that 
the Ukrainian side stands firm on the question of political and 
military cooperation between the fleets in the Black Sea region 
and in the South as a whole. He emphasized that the division 
formula "must respect Ukrainian legislation, otherwise it would 
be unacceptable to the people and parliament of Ukraine." The 
Ukrainian side expressed the hope that the division not only of 
ships but of the coastal infrastructure and the Black Sea Fleet 
aircraft would be discussed. Feliks Gromov said that issues 
concerning the infrastructure and the deployment of aircraft 
cannot be resolved without political decisions at the top level. 
  Further discussion revealed that the Russian side has not 
yet 
provided an official list of its ships and that the ships are 
being divided, according to Ukrainian Navy Commander Volodymyr 
Bezkorovaynyy, "at random." 
  While in Crimea, Valeriy Shmarov plans to visit Sevastopol 
docks and Donuzlav. Shmarov noted that the division of property 
is probably one of the key issues at the talks. He believes 
that the situation in the Black Sea Fleet "should not be 
described as a separation, since in the long run we are creating 
two friendly forces."

Surrenders Positions?"] 
  [Text] As is supposed, Anatoliy Chubays' fate will be 
decided in the next few days. Rather conducive to this also is 
the premier's vacations that he took to save face, and the 
temporary premiership of Oleg Soskovets, who has never been seen 
as being fond of Mr. Chubays, while being closely tied to Mr. 
Luzhkov. The latter's victory must among other things mean the 
end of privatization a la Chubays. One should not, however, 
forget that this privatization was publicly approved by Boris 
Yeltsin at one time. Thus, Luzhkov's victory over Chubays is 
first and foremost a blow at the president and a demonstration 
of the Moscow mayor's absolute power. 
  A NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent heard all of the above 
from a reliable source in the president's staff whose members 
have been of late shedding their loyalty to their present boss 
and pondering on who is going to be their next master. In their 
opinion, the greatest chances belong to the one who is now 
governing Russia's capital in a tough way.

  [Text] Kiev, 4 Jun--The conflict between Ukraine and its 
autonomy, the Republic of Crimea, evokes serious disquiet in the 
world community. This explains why Max van der Stoel, CSCE high 
commissioner for minorities, is visiting Ukraine for the third 
time in a month and a half. After returning from Crimea, he 
gave a news conference that was devoted to the results of his 
visit to Ukraine. 
  Max van der Stoel acquainted the Ukrainian and foreign 
journalists with the program of his visit. Most important were 
meetings with senior officials of Ukraine and Crimea. The CSCE 
high commissioner had an hour long conversation with Ukraine's 
president and twice met Deputy Prime Minister Mykola Zhulynskyy. 
In Kiev, he had talks with Oleksandr Yemets [minister for 
nationalities and migration], Anatoliy Zlenko [minister for 
foreign affairs], and Roman Shpek [minister of the economy]. In 
Crimea, van der Stoel met President Yuriy Meshkov, Deputy Prime 
Minister Yevgeniy Saburov, and Crimean Supreme Council Chairman 
Serhiy Tsekov. 
  The important guest's visit to Simferopol coincided with the 
consultations on the situation in Crimea between the 
parliamentary delegation of Ukraine, headed by Mr. Butkevych, 
and the delegation of the Republic of Crimea. The main 
conclusions drawn by the CSCE high commissioner for minorities 
were that both sides had taken part in the talks. Max Van der 
Stoel stressed, however, that, in addition to discussions at the 
level of parliamentary delegations, talks at the level of the 
governments of Ukraine and Crimea would not hurt. It is 
important to the high commissioner that the governments of 
Ukraine and Crimea confirm their wish to avoid incidents. 
  The aim of van der Stoel's mission was to find ways for the 
CSCE to contribute to maintaining peace and stability in the 
region. According to the high commissioner, his organization is 
ready to extend a helping hand in resolving the problems that 
have arisen between Ukraine and its autonomy. Van der Stoel 
refused to comment on exactly what sort of help this should be, 
but noted that he would submit his conclusions to the 
participants of the consultation of CSCE countries in Prague on 
13 June. He believes the Crimean issue to be a domestic 
conflict between Ukraine and Crimea. Regarding the influence of 
Russia, which is a CSCE member, on the Crimean issue, it should 
be guided in its actions, like all countries, by the main 
principle of the inviolability of borders and respect for the 
territorial integrity of states. 
  At the news conference, van der Stoel reported to the press 
the decision by the CSCE standing committee of (?28) May. The 
standing committee, a body representing 53 countries of the 
world, expressed concern at the development of events in the 
Republic of Crimea because they run counter to the basic 
principles of the CSCE. 
  The last question at the news conference concerned the 
latest 
"Ostankino" "sensation" regarding the presence of 120 Ukrainian 
paratroopers in Belbek. "I did not inspect the territory of 
Crimea, van der Stoel said, but everything I saw refutes these 
wild rumors. The situation in Crimea looks very calm."

  [Text] Max van der Stoel, CSCE high commissioner for 
minorities, has been visiting Ukraine since 31 May until 4 June. 
The aim of his visit was to study the situation in the Republic 
of Crimea, which took shape after its Supreme Council adopted a 
decision on restoring the 6 May 1992 wording of the Crimean 
constitution and also to work out recommendations concerning the 
participation of the CSCE in its settlement. 
  During the visit, Mr. Max van der Stoel had meetings with 
President Leonid Kravchuk, high-level officials of Ukraine and 
Crimea, and representatives of public organizations. The high 
commissioner highly assessed the balanced stand of Ukraine's 
leadership, based exceptionally on the provisions of the 
Constitution of Ukraine in its approaches to the solution of the 
Crimean issue. 
  Max van der Stoel emphasized the necessity of abiding by the 
fundamental principles of the CSCE, especially such principles 
as ensuring territorial integrity and inviolability of borders 
and also the necessity of the soonest possible settlement of the 
situation on legal principles. 
  The issue on the situation that took shape as a result of 
the 
actions by the Crimean leadership and the possible promotion of 
its solution on the part of CSCE is to be considered at a 
sitting of the CSCE committee of Senior officials, which will 
take place in Prague on 13-16 June.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Plotnikov from Simferopol; from the </F>
"Novosti" newscast] 
  [Text] A session of the Crimean Supreme Soviet today heard 
an appeal from the Russian State Duma which is ready, with 
account having been taken of the whole sensitivity of the 
situation that has come about, to do everything in its power to 
help in the search for constructive compromise on the basis of 
the Russian-Ukrainian Treaty of 1990. 
  For two centuries, reads the appeal, Crimea has served -- 
and will serve, we are convinced of that -- the interests of the 
fraternal peoples of Ukraine and Russia. Also today President 
Yuriy Meshkov said that the CSCE representative put forward a 
similar initiative. 
  As for the talks, they are currently continuing within the 
framework of the joint working commission. The main issue on 
which the consensus is being sought is an international human 
rights bill. The Crimean Supreme Soviet session is also under 
way at the same time. The issue of forming the government has 
been under consideration since the morning. Despite the fact 
that Deputy Prime Minister Yevgeniy Saburov met the deputies' 
requests more than half way, the deputies have, nonetheless, 
adopted not his, but their own draft resolution as the basis. 
The debate was prolonged into the evening hours.

  Moreover, a joint working group will be established in order 
to bring the Crimean legislation in conformity with the 
Ukrainian constitution and laws. 
  A Crimean delegation member, Chairman of the parliamentary 
Commission on State Construction Sergey Nikulin told 
INTERFAX-Ukraine that Crimean and Ukrainian parliamentarians had 
agreed that Crimean and Ukrainian legislation did not conform 
with each other on many points. 
  Nikulin said that this resulted in the inability of Crimea 
to 
pursue an independent economic policy. 
  He said that the issues on a treaty basis for bilateral 
relations and dual citizenship had not been discussed during the 
talks. 
  During the last month Ukrainian-Crimean relations were 
focused on the treaty basis for relations and on dual 
citizenship. The Crimean parliament restored this provision 
when re-establishing the Crimean constitution of 6 May 1992. 
The Ukrainian parliament disagreed with this and adopted the 
appropriate decision on 20 May urging the Crimean parliament to 
go back to the former version of the Constitution. 
  Nikulin stressed that this issue could be re-considered 
after 
Ukraine adopted its new constitution. 
  Commenting on the talks, Nikulin said that the Crimean 
delegation was even surprised with the complete understanding of 
its position by Kiev. "We want and we are ready to work 
together," he added. 
  This evening the Ukrainian parliamentary delegation will 
leave for Kiev.

<F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM correspondent Lev Ryabchikov for TASS] </F>
  [Text] Simferopol 3 June TASS -- The Crimean parliament has 
debated the republican government structure all day long today. 
  Parliament commissions and factions have discussed the 
structure for a long time, and elaborated three drafts of the 
corresponding law. The draft of the standing commission for 
state building, legislation, lawfulness and legal order 
coordinated with the government has been basically approved. 
  The draft includes a number of changes and amendments to the 
current law on the system of central bodies of the Crimean state 
executive power. Under the document all ministries and state 
committees of the republic shall be formed and liquidated by the 
parliament on proposal of the president. The minister shall be 
a government member, appointed and removed from his post by the 
president on coordination with the parliament. The government 
can also include heads of other central bodies. 
  The suggested number of ministries and state committees 
provoked parliament debates. It was finally decided to form key 
ministries in order to enable government work. Proposals on 
other ministries and committees will be submitted by the 
government to the parliament within two weeks. 
  Asked about the discussions, Vice-Premier Yevgeniy Saburov 
told UKRINFORM "it is a normal procedure. At the same time, the 
situation is rather tense and we cannot afford even a week. We 
should do it more quickly. But we have opponents in the 
parliament, and they are using all methods to protract the 
process. I am not sure everything will end today". 
  Despite this forecast, the parliament quickly agreed to 
confirm the appointment of Anatoliy Franchuk minister for 
control over state enterprises, Sergey Nikolskiy minister for 
agriculture and foodstuffs, Andrey Chernyavskiy minister of 
economy and Lyudmila Zaitseva minister of finance. The last 
three have moved to the Crimea from Moscow. 
  Working groups of deputies from the Ukrainian and Crimean 
parliaments continued working simultaneously with the debates to 
elaborate proposals on settlement of the Crimean problem.

<F P=106> [Speech by Republic of Crimea Deputy Prime Minister Yevgeniy </F>
Saburov at SEFRI seminar; place and date not given, rendered by 
Galina Kostina: "Crimea's Potential Is Great, But the State of 
Its Economy Is Absolutely Dismal..."] 
  [Excerpts] We have already reported that at a meeting with 
the participants of the SEFRI seminar and French Ambassador to 
Ukraine Michel Peissic, Yevgeniy Saburov attempted to outline in 
condensed form the economic situation in Crimea. We believe that 
the deputy prime minister's view of the realities, illusions, 
and prospects of the Republic of Crimea's development and his 
proposals on reforming the economy are of interest to Crimea 
residents and our readers. 
  Not many people know about the Crimea. I apologize for such 
a 
statement, but while I was born in the Crimea and am familiar 
with it, I never thought that it possessed such immense 
potential. Briefly, the southern zone, which occupies a fairly 
small territory, is a recreation zone. Next is the zone of 
agriculture--elite agriculture, I would say. It is viticulture 
and tobacco-growing in the south, fruit and vegetables, and in 
northern Crimea--hard varieties of wheat. The industrial zone 
also is not common knowledge, in particular, the 
military-industrial plants. There are some very modern 
high-technology plants, extremely interesting, which produce 
competitive products. For instance, there is a plant-- and I was 
astonished by this fact--that has orders from West Europe all 
the way through the year 2000. It is the Kerch plant Zaliv, 
which makes tankers. There is a rather substantial chemical 
industry in northern Crimea, some of it unique. 
  The Crimea has many ports. In Kerch, for instance, 
practically every plant has its own port. The Sevastopol ports 
are well known, but not all of them--and there are many. 
Donuzlav and Feodosiya are very interesting ports. In 
Chernomorskoye there is a Gazprom port, since gas is produced 
there, in the Tarkhankut area--quite a bit of it; there is also 
oil. 
  I want to mention one more fact, probably amazing to many: 
The Crimea has an absolutely fantastic airfield potential--there 
are 11 airfields, eight of which can accept "shuttles." They 
were used for testing the newest aircraft and aircraft 
carrier-launched aircraft. 
  This is its potential. But the current state of the Crimean 
economy is absolutely dismal. Plants are on the verge of 
stoppage; even Zaliv, which I mentioned, is in trouble. All the 
wine cellars are filled with our famous wines--a complete glut 
at a time when the demand for them, particularly in Russia, is 
enormous. Practically all industry and agriculture are near 
collapse. There is no money, and frequently no notion of how to 
utilize all this now. And, what is completely amazing, sometimes 
there is no understanding that the issue of production is not 
that important--the important part is to sell all the output. 
Amazingly, some enterprise directors still cannot grasp this 
notion. There is a quiet hatred toward middlemen who themselves 
do not produce anything and just want to make a profit at 
someone else's expense, but at the same time the directors 
themselves cannot sell anything. And if professional traders 
come to them, they are treated like gangsters. This is a problem 
that is described by a word that is fashionable these 
days--mentality. 
  We need to utilize the Crimea's potential. I believe this is 
not all that difficult to do. There is no other such elite 
region on the territory of the former USSR. I believe that this 
potential can be made to work rather quickly, but naturally 
serious reorganization is in order. What stands in the way of 
transformation--other than the mentality I mentioned? The 
absolutely unbelievable, terrible barriers we have erected 
between us. Since the Crimea is not Russia, Russia happily 
applies a custom duty on, in particular, Crimean wines, so that 
although the production cost is quite low, the price in Russia 
becomes very high. 
  Obstacles pop up in the most unexpected places. For 
instance, 
there is a Crimea-Caucasus ferry in Kerch Bay; it gets filled up 
on the Russian side, where a declaration has to be filled out 
for export of fuel and lubricant materials. [passage omitted] 
  Having come here, we decided to begin by removing the most 
glaring barriers to normal economic activities. In our opinion, 
it was prohibitive taxation. I was used to the fact that 
everybody in Russia complained about high taxes, but when I saw 
Ukrainian taxes, I was totally lost and could not figure out how 
anyone can work here at all. One of the specialists who came 
with me, after a good look at Ukrainian taxation, exclaimed: "My 
goodness, this is Abalkin's garrote, the shadow of forgotten 
forebears." We prepared, and the president of Crimea issued, an 
edict on changes in taxation. We no longer had any tax revenue, 
because nobody had any profit anymore. Lightening the tax burden 
in principle increased the tax revenue rather quickly. The 
second was, naturally, an edict of foreign currency regulations. 
It was not profitable to work with foreign currency. Foreign 
currency was confiscated at an exchange rate far below the real 
one. A free-floating foreign currency exchange rate is, in my 
opinion, an elementary requirement. The Ukrainian Government is 
killing its own exports and then wonders why it cannot pay for 
gas. Then they want to collect even more money to pay for gas, 
and then they absolutely cannot pay. I think this is 
self-strangulation. 
  The third edict is the edict on banks and banking 
activities. 
The most important part is that we want to lower the charter 
capital requirement. Ten million ECU is too much; at 1 million 
some Russian banks already expressed an interest in working 
here, in particular, Tveruniversalbank, Menatep, and Inkombank. 
This would resolve many problems of transfers. 
  It was a pleasant surprise for me to find out that many 
Ukrainian ministers support us. Our actions were to the liking 
of the main members of the cabinet, except the very top echelon. 
  Next we intend to seriously get into the process of 
privatization. The Ukrainian privatization scheme is quite 
dangerous. While the Russian scheme envisages a quick transfer 
of capital, and therefore the process of restructuring, in 
Ukraine, with its registered vouchers and absence of an 
investment fund, it is unclear how the transfer of capital will 
take place. Therefore we would like to utilize a somewhat 
different scheme. Of course, our dream would be to have the 
scheme that is being used by the Germans in the eastern lands. 
But this may take decades. 
  The purpose of privatization is more efficient operation of 
these production facilities--not collecting money for the 
treasury, as some think. I am fully convinced that it is not 
possible--and not necessary--to get any money for the treasury 
from privatization. The money some are able to pay for 
privatization should be invested in that same production, 
because there is not a single production facility right now that 
does not need investment. The treasury should count not on these 
one-time handouts from heaven--it should count on taxes from 
successfully operating enterprises. We need them to work. 
  This logic dictates the following method: Since we need to 
push citizens' money into privatization and investment, the 
voucher method is good as bait, to make them feel like a 
proprietor. After that, investment funds should get to work. 
  As early as 1988-89, when we discussed privatization 
programs, Western specialists advised us: You need to create 
investment funds, which will accumulate capital, since nobody 
will be able to invest such money on an individual basis. 
  As to the labor collective as proprietor, this is possible 
at 
small enterprises (small store or shop). People know one another 
in such places, trust one another, have responsibility toward 
one another; they understand that this really is their money, 
their income. As to large enterprises, this means stoppage. 
Privatization without investment is a myth. 
  The potential also can be seen from different angles. There 
are absolutely amazing illusions in the Crimea. One of them is 
that Crimean sanitariums are such a treasure that the whole 
world will rush to buy them, elbowing each other out of the way. 
What are we talking about when they do not even have normal 
plumbing? Generally, regarding recreation, I agree that very 
interesting work is underway on the southern shore of the 
Crimea, but I personally would not go for existing sanitariums. 
Unfinished construction--yes. But even better--new zones that 
could be developed into resorts. In particular, I have in mind 
Tarkhankut, which could easily become Crimea's second recreation 
zone. 
  I see the following areas as interesting for development and 
for applying oneself: banking, processing of agricultural 
products, marketing, trading Crimean wines, production and sales 
of the best varieties of tobacco--for instance, Dubek, which 
should be revived. In industry--air fields, ports, any industry 
where resource-saving technologies can be used; in short, 
everything I described as Crimea's potential.

  [Text] Simferopol [no dateline as received] -- At the 
morning sitting of the Crimean Supreme Council session on 3 
June, people's deputies approved the law "On introducing 
amendments and additions to the law `On the structure of the 
state executive power.'" In accordance with it, eight 
ministries are to be set up and the government is charged with 
considering and submitting, within 14 days, additional proposals 
to the Supreme Council about the structure of the government, 
i.e. about setting up several more ministries: A ministry of 
culture, a ministry of education, and a ministry in charge of 
nationalities and deported nations. In accordance with this law 
the appointment of the minister of finance, the minister of 
agriculture and food, the minister of economy, and the minister 
in charge of control over state enterprises will be confirmed. 
The minister of justice, the minister of internal affairs, and 
the chief of the Security Service, whose appointments have 
already been confirmed, are within the composition of the 
government. 
  During a break there was a news conference by the group 
"Respublika" of the Supreme Council of Crimea, which was 
registered on 2 June and which consists of 10 people. Volodymyr 
Klychnykov, chairman of the Crimean Union of the Afghanistan war 
veterans was elected its leader. According to the leaders of 
the "Respublika" group, which comprises part of the deputies who 
were running in the election to the Crimean Parliament on behalf 
of the "Rosiya" bloc, the setting up of the group does not mean 
a split of this bloc. The above deputies could not join the 
"Rosiya" group due to certain disagreements, above all, those 
concerning that provision of the statute according to which a 
decision of a majority is mandatory for all its members. 
Besides, said Klychnykov, there were personal conflicts between 
the leaders of the "Rosiya" group. He also emphasized: "We 
will work for the consolidation of the Crimean Republic's 
statehood." 
  As far as the future of Crimea is concerned, deputy chairman 
of the "Respublika" group pointed out that he favored Crimea's 
independence, however, it should be achieved by peaceful means, 
and it can be achieved, in his opinion, only after the people of 
Crimea become aware of themselves as a nation. 
  An appeal by Russia's State Duma has been sent to the 
Supreme 
Council of Crimea. It, in particular, expresses the hope that 
"the deputies to the Supreme Councils of Ukraine and Crimea will 
not allow irresponsible politicians to endanger peace and 
people's safety for the sake of reaching their selfish goals and 
taking advantage of the current moment." The Russian State Duma 
offered itself as a mediator in solving the conflict between 
Crimea and the authorities of Ukraine, so as to reach 
constructive compromises on the basis of a Ukrainian-Russian 
dialogue. 
  President of Crimea Yuriy Meshkov reported at the session 
that the commission of the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe is also ready to become a mediator in this 
issue.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Pilat in the "Crimea" column: </F>
"Parliament Confronts the President. Those Who Have Brought 
Meshkov to Power Are Not Content With His New Policy" -- 
"Postscript" by Aleksandr Anin] 
  [Text] It was reported earlier that the Crimean parliament 
has rejected President Yuriy Meshkov's request to grant him 
additional powers. Following are some details of that session. 
  At the very start of the resumed parliament session Crimean 
President Yuriy Meshkov moved to include in the agenda the 
question "On the Results of the 27 March 1994 Poll of Crimean 
Republic Citizens: On According Presidential Edicts the Power 
of Laws on Matters Which Temporarily Are Not Regulated by the 
Legislation of the Crimean Republic." Deputy Leonid Grach spoke 
up immediately: "This contradicts the constitution of Crimea on 
the inadmissibility of delegating powers from one branch of 
power to another." Deputy Boris Kizilov noted, "It is not clear 
yet who summed up the results of the poll and how," (the poll 
results were summed up by the president's team without the 
participation of the Crimean Central Election Commission -- 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA), "and therefore the poll results do not 
have legal force." Deputy Vasiliy Kiselev pointed out that many 
of Yuriy Meshkov's edicts have been issued in gross violation of 
the Crimean republic's constitution, continuing, "Any usurpation 
of power is illegal, the constitution says. Until we have 
changed this provision of the Constitution, we cannot grant the 
president such powers." 
  Speaking one after another, deputies, with rare exception, 
maintained that they can tackle any questions and that there is 
no need to grant the president additional powers. Mikhail 
Kukushkin said, "All actions by the president are reminiscent of 
an election fever. He is trying to prod the deputies to climb 
on top an armored car again." 
  In the end, the issue was taken off the agenda. Therefore, 
in spite of the fact that the majority of deputies were elected 
from the Rossiya bloc, which, incidentally, brought Yuriy 
Meshkov to power, there is no agreement between him and 
parliament. Observers believe that confrontation will only grow 
in the future. 
  P.S. In supporting Yuriy Meshkov in presidential elections, 
the Rossiya bloc expected that its representatives would get key 
posts in the Cabinet of Ministers. Meshkov, however, invited 
Muscovite Yevgeniy Saburov to head the government, who in turn 
brought a Moscow team along to Simferopol. 
  Rossiya and the Impeks-55 commercial and financial group 
behind it could probably agree with this if they knew exactly 
that in the upcoming privatization they would retain the supreme 
right to control land and real estate on the peninsula. 
  But the fact is that no one is sure that the Saburov team 
will not fertilize Crimean privatization with Russian capital. 
Rather, there is a certitude to the contrary: As soon as 
Yevgeniy Saburov came to Simferopol, he said that he favors 
broad participation of foreign money in Crimea's economy. 
  Today, having finally appreciated what Saburov meant by 
"foreign," yesterday's presidential support group would like to 
get rid of the visiting premier -- and the sooner, the better. 
By its latest demarche parliament warns Yuriy Meshkov, as it 
were, about the possible consequences he would face if he 
continues to keep his Moscow protege afloat.

  [Text] Parliamentary delegations from Ukraine and Crimea 
have ended talks in Simferopol on the settlement of the Crimean 
problem. In a final document, the participants noted that 
proposals for coordinating the two sides' legislations should be 
prepared by 15 June. At the same time, the delegations agreed 
that the Ukrainian constitution has supremacy over other laws on 
the territory of Crimea. 
  It was decided to set up a joint working group which will 
deal with the delineation of authorities between Ukrainian and 
Crimean state structures. At the same time amendments will be 
made to Ukrainian laws. 
  The delegation from the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet asked 
President Leonid Kravchuk not to take any measures against the 
Crimean authorities. The Ukrainian delegation also addressed a 
similar request to President Yuriy Meshkov. 
  INTERFAX reports that Oleksandr Moroz, chairman of the 
Ukrainian parliament, plans to arrive in Simferopol on 
Wednesday.

  [Text] An extended session of the military collegium of 
Ukraine's Ministry of Defense took place on 3 June. Our 
free-lance military correspondent reports: 
  [Correspondent] The combat training of Ukraine's Armed 
Forces 
during the winter training period was summed up at the session 
under the chairmanship of Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy, 
minister of defense. The main conclusion drawn at the collegium 
was that the troops had achieved a high level of discipline and 
combat capability during the winter period. This allows one to 
efficiently fulfill the main task of Ukraine's Armed Forces: to 
defend the state's sovereignty and territorial integrity. 
  At this session of the military collegium, the minister of 
defense set tasks for the summer training period and outlined 
the set of issues that it is necessary to resolve urgently. 
Among them are the tasks of establishing strong statutory order 
and military discipline in the units and subunits and to prevent 
injuries and noncombat losses among personnel. Commanders at 
all levels should pay great attention to the storage and 
operation of hardware and armaments and to the precise 
organization of mobilization work. 
  Radetskyy stressed that resolute and urgent actions would 
continue to be used in relation to officials who abuse their 
official position and have an indifferent attitude to the theft 
of military property and other illegal actions by servicemen.

  [Text] At the beginning of the morning plenary sitting of 
the Supreme Council of Ukraine on 3 June, at the request of 
people's deputies Volodymyr Marchenko and Vyacheslav Chornovil, 
it was decided that on 12 June the interpretation of several 
articles of the Law of Ukraine "On the election of people's 
deputies of Ukraine" will be considered. 
  People's deputy Petro Sheyko said that in accordance with 
the 
application, Vasyl Durdynets was dismissed from the post of 
chairman of the "Center" group. Anton Buteyko was elected its 
chairman and Volodymyr Yavorivskyy and Valeriy Kolomoytsev were 
elected his deputies. 
  An issue on the draft law "On introducing amendments and 
additions to the law "On the formation of local bodies of power 
and self-government," approved at the first reading on 2 June, 
was put on the agenda. Serhiy Sobolev, member of the commission 
for issues of legal policy and judicial and legal reform, 
reported that at the sitting of the commission on 2 June, 
attended by all interested deputies, it was resolved to submit 
only one amendment for consideration by the session: to cancel 
direct elections of chairmen of oblast councils and hold 
elections of chairmen of the Kiev and Sevastopol city councils. 
  According to Serhiy Sobolev, such an amendment to the law 
will essentially change the election procedure and, therefore, 
relevant amendments should be introduced to the constitution of 
Ukraine. After a brief discussion two proposals were submitted 
for consideration: one by Serhiy Sobolev and also a proposal by 
Vasyl Kornelyuk not to consider amendments to the law at all, 
because there is only little time before the elections. 
  After a break, representatives of groups and groupings were 
given the floor to speak on the issue under consideration. 
Representatives of National Democratic groups insisted on the 
necessity to cancel direct elections of chairmen of oblast 
councils because, in their opinion, this would inevitably lead 
to the emergence of "25 princes accountable neither to the 
Supreme Council nor to the head of state." 
  Serhiy Holovatyy reminded that the decision on direct 
elections was approved at the request of Ivan Plyushch with no 
written text available to the deputies and in the absence of a 
quorum. 
  Representatives of left-wing groups as well as the 
interregional deputy grouping and "Unity" group insisted on the 
necessity of preserving direct elections of chairmen of oblast 
councils. By a majority of votes the proposal by the Supreme 
Council commission for issues of legal policy and judicial and 
legal reform to cancel direct elections of chairmen of oblast 
councils was declined, 
  After this the deputies continued to approve the composition 
of the Supreme Council standing commissions.

  [Text] On 3 June Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk 
visited open-type joint-stock society KievHuma [Kiev rubber]. 
The following report is presented by Yuriy Horban. 
  [Horban] Leonid Kravchuk acquainted himself with the 
products 
of this enterprise, which is one of the first joint-stock 
societies in Ukraine, and also met the working collective and 
representatives of the Union of Independent Entrepreneurs. 
Therefore, not only the activity of a definite production unit 
but the entrepreneurial movement as a whole was a subject of 
discussion. 
  According to certain speakers, the wild process of 
accumulating capital, which some of their colleagues in Ukraine 
have abused before now, is almost over. The prestige of the 
state, the firm and even trademark becomes ever more prevailing 
in the activities of the new structures. It was emphasized that 
private enterprises, like state ones, now require stability most 
of all, first and foremost a stability of legislation. It is 
not for the first time that issues of foreign economic 
activities, taxation and exchange rate policies and currency 
regulation were discussed. The unsatisfactory nature of the 
relevant laws scares potential investors off Ukraine and leads 
to a total collapse of the state's economy. 
  The participants in the meeting emphasized their support to 
the economic movement on way of reforms and expressed their 
belief that President Kravchuk is the main guarantor of their 
implementation. As was pointed out, certain political forces 
wish to blame the reforms, the market and entrepreneurs for all 
the economic troubles, although they themselves torpedoed these 
reforms and continue to torpedo them. 
  In his speech, Leonid Kravchuk emphasized his loyalty to the 
course of economic transformations and also spoke out in favor 
of the state sector where 90 percent of the economic capacities 
are concentrated today. The president of Ukraine referred to 
power engineering and agriculture as the industries which 
require most of the state's support. Leonid Kravchuk analyzed 
the causes of the crisis and referred to the contradiction 
between market laws and anti-market ones and also failure of 
public opinion to accept the high rate of a transition to a new 
system as one of the causes. The president also expressed his 
views concerning the current political situation. 
  [Begin Kravchuk recording] As far as the elections are 
concerned, well, the Supreme Council took a decision that the 
elections would take place and there would be no changes. In 
other words, we are now entering a permanent process of 
elections. On 26 June, [pauses] It is clear that this will not 
be the end. I am not sure that all will be elected on 26 June. 
If the president is not elected, on 10 July there will be a 
repeat election. Then, in one month's time there will be 
elections to local bodies. On 24 July they will again fail to 
elect all the 112 deputies and again they will postpone the 
elections. That is to say, we shall enter the new year on the 
wave of elections. 
  I have honestly done everything possible to prove that these 
elections today, even proceeding from the fact that they are 
necessary, are dangerous and ineffective because they have no 
legal basis. Nowhere in the world, [pauses] Ukraine will be a 
unique state which is holding elections having neither 
provisions in the Constitution nor the laws which would regulate 
the power bodies. When I tell this, they say: You are telling 
this just to retain your post. And the overwhelming majority of 
people, let us say, [passage indistinct], can believe that this 
is the only desire of the current president. 
  I was telling the Supreme Council that the Supreme Council 
assumed huge political and historic responsibility. If no laws 
regulating and determining the structure of power bodies at the 
local level are adopted, we shall have the executive power 
completely ruined. I underline this: completely ruined. We 
shall have 25 Crimeas or even more, because today, as the 
president, I can rescind a decree by the president of Crimea in 
compliance with the Constitution, however no one, neither the 
president nor the government, can rescind a decision by a 
chairman of the oblast council. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Anatoliy Druzenko: "Leonid Kravchuk: Every Day </F>
I Repeat Like `Our Father': War Between Ukraine and Russia Is 
Inconceivable"] 
  [Text] Kiev -- In what is to put it mildly a disparate 
situation -- the exacerbation of the Crimean problem, the hitch 
in dividing up the Black Sea Fleet, battles over the impending 
presidential election, and continuing economic slump -- Russian 
mass media leaders came to meet with the Ukrainian president and 
talk with him "about the present moment." Ostankino will 
shortly be showing a recording of this conversation but, given 
the interest in what is happening in Ukraine today, I would like 
to tell you in brief, as a participant in the discussion, about 
the main ideas voiced by the Ukrainian president. 
<H5>  The Crimea Problem </H5>
  When asked by one of my colleagues whether the problem of 
the 
Crimea should not be resolved, given its complexity, by creating 
the institution of joint Russian-Ukrainian possession of the 
Crimea, the president countered with another question: What 
might such an institution mean, and is it at all feasible? 
Kravchuk remarked after giving not entirely clear explanations 
that this idea (or proposal) should come from the Crimean 
leadership but, in the opinion of the Ukrainian president, it 
would be naive to expect that kind of movement on their part. 
Today we are rather talking about the opposite: The Crimean 
authorities are first trying to obtain recognition for their 
state and then to join Russia. The upshot is that the idea of 
joint possession could turn into a situation where Russia would 
have 95 percent of the Crimea and Ukraine would have the 
remaining 5 percent, to which the latter would naturally not 
agree. A normal "civilized" solution is only possible within 
the framework of the existing Ukrainian Constitution. 
<H5>  The Possibility of a Federal System in Ukraine </H5>
  L. Kravchuk was cagey on this issue. He cited the example of 
the United States and commented that a considerable amount of 
time is needed to create a federal state, particularly if it is 
born of of a unitary state like Ukraine. It is primarily 
necessary to formalize the legal basis for this process and, 
even with a highly professional parliament, this would take 
several years. Kravchuk thinks that for the formation of a 
federal state on German lines the conditions must be ripe. The 
danger of haste here is too great; it could jeopardize the 
existing Ukrainian state. 
<H5>  The Origins of the Economic Crisis </H5>
  The president disagreed with the conclusion drawn by one of 
the participants in the meeting that the Ukrainian economy is 
terminally sick. Although he did not deny that the slump in 
production and the decline in the standard of living are 
continuing. Certainly, Kravchuk remarked, plenty of mistakes 
have been made in the course of reforms, but nevertheless he 
sees the main reason for the crisis as being the fact that 
Russia was too quick in making Ukraine pay for power sources at 
world prices (incidentally, these resources represent over half 
of Ukrainian imports). A particularly dramatic situation 
developed late last year when prices of oil and gas rose 
10,000-fold in a short time (the president repeated this figure 
three times and then added that no economy would withstand that 
kind of ordeal). Even had we implemented reforms in an ideal 
fashion, Kravchuk summed up this part of the conversation, the 
"energy factor," that is an outside factor, would have 
nonetheless brought about a critical situation. 
<H5>  Back to the Crimean Problem </H5>
  "The leadership of Ukraine and myself as president will 
never 
agree to the use of strong-arm methods to resolve the question 
of the Crimea," Leonid Kravchuk said firmly, in the spirit of, 
one might say, an official statement. "That would be a great 
calamity both for Russia and Ukraine, but calamity would above 
all befall our Ukrainian home." 
  We expect the same attitude to the problem, our interlocutor 
remarked, from the Russian leadership and particularly from 
Crimea, although there is no confidence about this. The 
president said that he takes an extremely negative view of the 
appearance in the Crimea of Cossacks from Russia, which he sees 
as an attempt to lend the conflict the nature of the "Dniester 
scenario" and with which the Ukrainian side resolutely disagrees. 
<H5>  Three Main Desires </H5>
  When asked which objectives he would be satisfied to see 
attained as a politician and state leader, Leonid Kravchuk said 
that he would consider his mission accomplished if progress 
occurs in the following areas. First, in stopping the slump in 
production and achieving albeit slight growth. Second, in 
consolidating and rendering irreversible friendly partnership 
relations between Ukraine and Russia. Every day, the president 
remarked, I repeat like "Our Father": War between our countries 
is inconceivable and, no matter what extremists on both sides 
do, we must not permit a tragedy; our peoples, our children, and 
grandchildren will not forgive us, nor will history. And 
finally the president's last wish is to reinforce in the 
national consciousness the sense of dignity and escape, as he 
said, from the "remnants of slave mentality" inculcated over the 
centuries by the empire -- first the Russian and then the Soviet 
empire. 
<H5>  The Coming Presidential Elections </H5>
  Our discussion took place a few hours before the Ukrainian 
parliament decided that presidential elections will nonetheless 
go ahead 26 June. There is every indication that Kravchuk was 
prepared for that decision although the day before he asked the 
Supreme Rada to postpone the elections until later. Our 
interlocutor is prepared to take part in the presidential 
election race. 
  He was diplomatic about the chances of the contenders, 
including his own. Nevertheless, he did conjecture that there 
will be no victor in the first round and that a second round 
will have to be held. A poll of voters conducted recently in a 
number of oblasts showed that 27 and 20 percent are willing to 
vote for Kravchuk and Kuchma respectively, while the other 
candidates are lagging considerably behind. However, Kravchuk 
warned that these figures should not be overestimated: The 
situation can change in a day. Although, the president summed 
up, there is every indication that he and Kuchma will have a 
showdown during the second round. 
  Our interlocutor refrained from predicting the final 
presidential election result.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 106 (596) by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy and edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] President Leonid Kravchuk named the former prime 
minister, Leonid Kuchma, as his main rival at the forthcoming 
presidential elections at a meeting with the editors of a number 
of Russian newspapers Thursday evening. He said the winner of 
the presidential race would become clear only in the second 
round which, in his words, would become a "duel" between himself 
and Kuchma. 
  The head of state based his argument on the results of an 
opinion poll, which had indicated that 27 percent of the 
electorate would vote for Kravchuk and 20 percent for Kuchma. 
  However, the Leonid Kuchma thinks his main rival will be the 
last Supreme Soviet speaker, Ivan Plyushch. "Plyushch," he said, 
"really concentrated power in Ukraine into his own hands." 
Observers back that argument up by the fact that Plyushch has 
the support of most local authorities in the Republic. He was 
behind a law, which will give the heads of local authorities all 
power in their regions after the 26 June elections, and that 
will help him considerably in his pre-election campaign in a 
number of regions and at local polling stations, they say. 
  The speaker of the current Supreme Soviet, Aleksandr Moroz, 
is thought to have less chances of success. However, his recent 
exploits have done much in the objective sense to earn him more 
popularity among the eastern "Russian-speaking" regions of 
Ukraine. Moroz has a balanced approach to the Crimean issue, and 
his firm opposition to President Kravchuk's plea for the 
presidential and local elections to be postponed to a later date 
is also in his favor. 
  The Supreme Soviet on Thursday evening rejected Kravchuk's 
proposal to defer the elections. 
  IF Note: A parliament resolution stated that it [the 
parliament] considered it undesirable to postpone the elections 
to a later date give that preparations for those elections were 
almost complete, with "election constituencies and commissions 
set up and candidates for the presidency and local government 
registered." 
  However, the parliament approved Kravchuk's proposal to 
create a legal base for the future president to exercise his 
powers. Supreme Soviet commissions have been recommended to 
submit their proposals for draft laws governing then powers of 
the Ukrainian president, cabinet of ministers and local 
authorities and governments by 12 June. 
  The government has been requested to submit a draft law on 
the cabinet of ministers to the Supreme Soviet, also by 12 June. 
The law would define the rights of the cabinet of ministers and 
regulate its relations with local authorities.

  [Text] Kiev -- Oleksandr Tkachenko, deputy chairman of 
Ukraine's Supreme Council, in the chair at the session on 3 
June, announced a closed sitting, not naming the issues that 
would be examined. 
  A UNIAN correspondent learned from unofficial sources that 
material and domestic provisions for people's deputies were 
discussed. It was stated that the state's Supreme Council and 
leadership had been revealed as unprepared for the elections 
taking place and for parliament being competent, because there 
were not even enough places for deputies in hotels. Members of 
the provisional commission for the provision of deputies' 
accommodation noted that the granting of apartments to all 
deputies is also still a problem. 
  After this some of the deputies expressed themselves in 
favor 
of the advisability of the existence of a semi-professional 
parliament: half works permanently and half comes for the 
sessions. This proposal caused the most arguments because such 
a proposal would, in the first place, suit representatives from 
government and commercial structures, who up to now have not 
resigned from their previous place of work. People's deputy 
Ivan Zayets maintained in his speech that he knows of one 
building for deputies, which will be rented out in the district, 
where he stood for election. Should the electors disagree with 
parliament decisions, one may expect picketing of this building. 
  It was learned from the same sources that the closed sitting 
was also about payment for the labor of people's deputies. 
According to a deputy who did not wish to be named, the talk is 
about a payment, which would only be sufficient for food. 
  At the sitting, Oleksandr Tkachenko reported that the 
candidacy of Vitaliy Masol for the post of Ukraine's prime 
minister would be submitted for examination by Ukraine's Supreme 
Council on 14 June. The deputies are to determine their 
positions regarding this in groups and commissions by the said 
date. 
  Masol is a former chairman of the Council of Ministers of 
the 
Ukraine Soviet Socialist Republic, who resigned at the demand of 
the hunger-striking students in October 1990. He is an 
economist, who graduated from the Kiev polytechnic institute and 
the institute of management of the national economy, and managed 
a heavy machine-building enterprise. He was a people's deputy 
of the Supreme Council of the Ukrain Soviet Socialist Republic 
of the 9th-11th convocations, and also head of Ukraine's state 
planning, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist 
Party of the Soviet Union, and a deputy of the Supreme Council 
of the USSR of the 10th-11th convocations. He will be 66 years 
old in November 1994.

  [Text] Odessa -- Ukrainian presidential candidate Leonid 
Kuchma outlined his platform again at a meeting with the cadets 
of a local militia school on 2 June. "Last year I signed a joint 
statement with [Russian prime minister] Chernomyrdin and 
[Belarusian prime minister] Kebich on the creation of an 
economic union to lift customs barriers," he said. But the 
Ukrainian media accused me of pro-Russian sentiments, and the 
eastern and southern regions for some reason did not support me, 
although they should have...." 
  Leonid Kuchma clarified his position on the Crimean issue: 
"The Crimeans must be given greater freedom within Ukraine." 
  The candidate believes that everyone must take the blame for 
the Belavezha "crime" [reference to the formation of the CIS], 
and that the Black Sea Fleet should be sold to Russia because it 
"has strategic interests in the Black Sea" which it will not 
renounce, while "Ukraine is incapable of maintaining the fleet." 
  After the meeting, Oleksandr Mayorov, general secretary of 
the Central Committee of the Renewed Communist Party of Ukraine 
told UNIAN: "We communists will vote for Leonid Kuchma."

  [Text] Kiev: On 2 June, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk 
signed a directive "On providing the formation of Ukraine's food 
resources with finances and credits." 
  In Ukrainian Agriculture and Food Minister Yuriy Karasyk's 
words, a large group of professionals, who include National Bank 
of Ukraine board chairman Viktor Yushchenko, has been engaged to 
draft this directive. 
  The directive deals with a new source of credits, which is 
10 
percent of the credit resources that are available to commercial 
banks and that are to be sold by them to the National Bank of 
Ukraine to provide payments in advance and credits for the 
agrarian sector. The economic mechanisms contained in this 
provision should be of interest to commercial banks as the 
directive rules that the taxes payable by the banks on credits 
in the event of their sale to the National Bank of Ukraine are 
to be cut from 55 to 11 percent. 
  The directive also makes provision for the return of 
stabilization funds rather than adopting a money-printing 
approach to the allocation of funds providing credits for 
agriculture. 
  The directive also contains the following mechanism for 
payments to be made by the trading organizations to the 
agricultural producers: Upon the expiry of three days following 
a sale, a penalty to the amount of three percent of the sum 
outstanding is charged daily. There is a term of 15 days for 
credits to be issued to trading organizations for them to pay in 
advance for agricultural produce. The directive instructs the 
Cabinet of Ministers to devise a pricing mechanism by 1 July. 
  In Yuriy Karasyk's view, "this provision in the directive is 
very important as agriculture is owed 12 trillion karbovantsi by 
the army, prison services, and trading organizations, with the 
debt of the latter to the countryside amounting to 4 trillion 
karbovantsi. This clause in the directive also enables city and 
town state administrations, goods manufacturers and trading 
organizations to work without waiting for the government." 
  However, in Yuriy Karasyk's view, "this is a once only 
directive. In the transitional period, no legislative basis has 
been created yet so the president has said the word for the 
Supreme Council not to be `firemen'." 
  In the minister's opinion, there will be no confrontation 
between the Supreme Council and the president because the 
directive takes account of proposals by Ukrainian people's 
deputies.

  [Text] Pro-communist forces are seeking to remove from the 
political scene the three men who were the authors of the 1991 
Belovezh agreements of 1991 on establishment of the CIS, 
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk said today. He added that 
following this the pro-communist forces would annul the Belovezh 
agreements and restore the USSR. 
  Commenting on the political situation in Ukraine, Kravchuk 
stated that the decision that the presidential and local 
elections take place this June could completely destroy 
executive power in the country. 
  Kravchuk said he could have decided not to run for 
presidency. However, he suggested that those who will take part 
in the presidential race could in two days eliminate everything 
which had been created, if one of the present candidates is 
elected president.

  [Text] The extended council of the opposition Ukrainian 
people's movement, or the Rukh, decided at the session on Sunday 
to form a shadow Cabinet. 
  A shadow government will work out alternative programs for 
the country's development and carry out constructive opposition 
activities towards the present Cabinet, said the movement's 
leader, Vyacheslav Chornovyl in an interview to Interfax-Ukraine. 
  The Rukh council also decided to "denounce even more the 
Communist ideology and carry out a resolute struggle with the 
ruling party which tries to stop the economic reforms". 
  The movement's leadership recommended that primary 
organizations focus efforts on local elections which will take 
place on June 26 alongside the presidential ones. Chornovyl 
believes the Rukh may win the mayors' elections in over 20 large 
cities and try to win the elections in another 700 
constituencies. 
  The council confirmed the intention to vote at the 
presidential elections against former prime minister Leonid 
Kuchma and the current parliament speaker Aleksandr Moroz 
because it believes they pose danger for sovereignty and 
independence of Ukraine.

  [Text] Kiev 3 June TASS -- A meeting of Deputy Ukrainian 
Parliament Speaker Oleg Demin with CSCE High Commissioner for 
Ethnic Minorities Max van der Stoel was held here today. The 
commissioner has arrived in Kiev on a working visit at the 
invitation of the Ukrainian Government. 
  The deputy speaker informed the visitor of the current 
social, economic and political situation in Ukraine, the work of 
the new parliament and the situation in the Crimea, where a 
Ukrainian parliamentary delegation is searching for 
constitutional and law-governed ways to settle the problems. 
  In his turn, Max van der Stoel said he values high the 
Ukrainian policy on ethnic relations, including the provision of 
ethnic minorities rights. In his opinion, this policy is a 
model one. 
  He counts on the Ukrainian and Crimean governments to start 
negotiations and find a way out of the situation. In his 
opinion, there are plenty of ways and one should only wish to 
use them. 
  Max van der Stoel called for larger and more efficient 
assistance to Ukraine in order to help it overcome the economic 
crisis. He stressed he will initiate this and other issues 
within the limits of his competence and abilities. 
  The meeting was friendly and cordial, and proved high 
interest of the sides in development of comprehensive 
cooperation and settlement of all disputable issues in a legal 
way and through compromises which unite people and bring them 
peace and good.

  [Text] Kiev, 4 June (TASS) -- A major principle of CSCE is 
inviolability of borders; this principle should be the basic one 
in the search for mutually acceptable solutions of 
Ukrainian-Crimean problems, CSCE High Commissioner for Ethnic 
Minorities Max Van der Stoel said here today. 
  The high commissioner has been to Ukraine on a four-day 
visit 
to meet Ukrainian and Crimean officials and discuss the 
situation around the Crimea. 
  In his words, CSCE will render comprehensive assistance to

  [Text] Minsk, 6 June -- Commonwealth Executive Secretary 
Ivan Korotchenya received CSCE Secretary General Wilhelm 
Hoeynck, who arrived in Minsk at Korotchenya 's invitation on 
Sunday [5 June], at the CIS headquarters today. A productive 
conversation about common CIS and CSCE problems took place. The 
"hot" spots in particular were discussed. 
  Wilhelm Hoeynck noted that in his view the current concept 
of 
peacemaking should be amended slightly. For example, he thinks 
that the concept should reflect the need for the parties in a 
conflict to agree to the introduction of UN forces and to the 
conditions for cooperation between observers and the 
peacekeeping forces; and the procedure for withdrawing troops 
from the conflict zone should be set out. 
  I. Korotchenya and W. Hoeynck were in mutual understanding 
on 
the issue of strengthing links between the CSCE and CIS working 
bodies and joining efforts in peacemaking activities. The CSCE 
secretary general was also interested in the CIS situation, 
prospects, and integrationary policies. Detailed answers were 
given to these questions.

Ivan Karatchenya. On the same day, Hoeynck met Secretary 
Karatchenya and discussed a wide range of issues including 
regional conflicts in Europe. The parties agreed that it is

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 7 TASS -- ROSSIYSKIYE GAZETA on Russia's 
state budget for 1994. 
  In an article headlined "We Are All Hostages of the 
Military- 
Industrial Complex", the newspaper describes it as a war-time 
budget. 
  Comparing last year's and this year's state expenditure, the 
writer of the article arrives at a conclusion that no military 
reform is underway in the country and, as a consequence, there 
is no reduction in military expenditure. 
  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, in another article, reports that an 
attempt by high-speed Japanese schooners to intrude into Russian 
territorial waters en masse was stopped in the area of south 
Kurils. The chief committee of Russia's frontier forces views 
the attempt as a test of vigilance of the forces involved in the 
Putina (Fishing Season)-94 anti-poaching operation. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an interview with General 
Aleksandr Lebed, commander of the 14th Russian Army stationed in 
Tiraspol. 
  "In the Dniester region, one should not act by strongarm 
tactics. It is necessary to democratise the situation. 
Historical experience indicates that all wars end with peace. 
Wise is the one who prevents a war and, if it still breaks out, 
brings it to an end as soon as possible and keeps peace for as 
long as possible," Lebed said. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA runs an interview with Viktor Davydkin, 
deputy chairman of Russia's Choice movement, who said: "The 
democratic movement is heterogeneous and it is possible to unite 
it only on the basis of flexible, even loose blocs, movements, 
etc. We are in for a difficult struggle against nascent fascism 
in Russia. But this struggle can be effective only if we act in 
alliance with all anti-fascist forces." 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI reports that Russia's first food quality 
control laboratory, financed by the European Union, has opened 
in the city of Pushchino near Moscow on the basis of the Russian 
Academy of Sciences' Institute of Bio-Chemistry and Physiology 
of Microorganisms and the Pushchino Agrocollege. 
  The job of the laboratory is to analyse food passing through 
the customs and supplied to private shops from 
individually-operated farms. 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI comments on rumours about the possibility 
of an increase in the prices of bread in Russia: 
  "Elementary economic calculations show that one tonne of 
Canadian grain in St. Petersburg will be under any circumstances 
100,000 roubles cheaper than Krasnodar-produced one. 
  "If the situation concerning the prime cost of nationally 
produced grain does not change and transportation tariffs 
continue to grow rapidly, loafs of imported bread will soon be 
on sale in commercial kiosks at prices that will be much more 
acceptable than those in a nearby bakery shop". 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI interviewed Crimean Vice-Premier Yevgeniy 
Saburov who set out his vision of the Crimea's future. 
  Saburov visualises the Crimea "first of all, as part of 
Ukraine, with transparent borders and dual citizenship, after 
European standards, well-established social and cultural 
contacts with Russia. Private international capital. 
Recreation, an elite agriculture, transport arteries, airports, 
seaports. The Crimea as a bridge of friendship between East and 
West". 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI runs an interview with Yuriy Tompakov, 
departmental chief at the Moscow prosecutor's office directorate 
for the supervision of investigation. 
  His opinion is that "it is increasingly probable that 
criminal outfits may take the path of terrorist acts against 
prominent businessmen, bankers, representatives of political 
parties and public organisations, civil servants, and deputies. 
Attempts on the life of members of personnel of law enforcement 
agencies cannot be ruled out either". 
  TRUD carries an interview with Russian Defence Minister 
Pavel 
Grachev who said: "We have to change the structure of the armed 
forces, their manning system, withdraw troops from abroad and 
accommodate them at home, constantly maintain their fighting 
efficiency at proper level and at the same time tackle a lot of 
legislative and social issues. 
  "We have brought back to Russia about 140 units at an 
aggregate strength of 280,000. All that is being done with more 
than modest funding. The shortage of funds results in lack of 
housing, poor accommodation, grievances and disappointments." 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) reports that criminal groups in 
southern Russia try to counteract the Russian Interior Ministry 
Putina-94 anti-poaching operation in the Caspian. "This is why 
we have to use firearms when detaining poachers," Police Colonel 
Aleksandr Frolov, chief of the operation headquarters, told the 
newspaper. 
  Several tens of firearms, including submachine-guns, were 
withdrawn from criminal groups during the operation in the 
Caspian. Ammunition for bear hunting was also confiscated at 
poachers' bases that had been discovered. 
  RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA runs an interview with Major-General 
Nikolay Bezborodov, deputy chairman of the Russian State Duma 
committee on defence, who dwelt on Russo-Azerbaijani relations. 
  "The language of ultimata is not the best one, still less in 
a most complex situation. It is high time the ministers of 
defence and foreign affairs gave explanations to the deputies 
about a number of problems that have piled up".

  [Text] Moscow June 7 TASS -- The armed forces cannot exist 
as one of major elements of Russian statehood without a 
minimally sufficient and steady financing, Major-General 
Vladimir Osadchiy, representative of the Russian Defence 
Ministry, told ITAR-TASS. A military budget to be discussed in 
its second reading at the State Duma hearings on Wednesday may 
become the last one for the army and navy, he stated. 
  Osadchiy said deputies in State Duma factions and committees 
are being intensively coached and calculations by Sergey 
Glazyev, who found additional sources of revenue to finance 
defence spending, are being severely criticised. 
  General Osadchiy believes that Tuesday's press conference of 
Petr Shirshov, chairman of the Federation Council committee on 
security and defence, is to demonstrate the Federation Council's 
stand once again. 
  The Council declared for an increase in military 
expenditure, 
taking into account both inflation and an utter necessity to buy 
hardware and arms, pay money allowance to servicemen, and cater 
for soldiers and seamen. 
  If the State Duma on Wednesday fails to heed the Federation 
Council's recommendations, this military budget may become the 
last one for the armed forces, for they would not be able to 
exist as one of major elements of Russian statehood without a 
minimally sufficient and steady financing, General Osadchiy said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Bauer, chairman of the Committee To </F>
Organize the Work of the State Duma, by Yevgeniy Skukin: "New 
Premises To Bring No Joy"] 
  [Text] [Skukin] Vladimir Anatolyevich, can one 
congratulate the Duma on another move? 
  [Bauer] Hold your horses. Neither the Economy Ministry, nor 
the State Committee for Construction, nor the Moscow trade 
unions are in a hurry to leave the premises that are being 
transferred to us, thereby showing their contempt for the 
president's edicts and the government's decrees. In the end 
they even organized pickets. 
  [Skukin] Maybe there is simply nowhere for them to go? 
  [Bauer] All these organizations have been given sufficient 
space. Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin promised to personally 
supervise their move. 
  [Skukin] But when they finally go, will the deputies have 
all they need for their work, what they were so badly lacking in 
the former CEMA building? 
  [Bauer] Of course, we will not achieve the conditions the 
old parliament had in the White House. The State Planning 
Committee building is a purely ministerial building; what you 
don't have here, for example, is the facilities to receive 
visitors and for deputies to relax properly. But it will be 
more comfortable than it was! When we get the full 28,000 
square meters of space each deputy plus assistant will have a 
separate room measuring 17-18 square metrrs, with a telephone 
and internal communications. In short, working conditions are 
perfectly suitable for the transitional period. 
  [Skukin] There are many and various rumors about the 
extraordinarily high cost of the upcoming refurbishment of the 
building. Would it not be cheaper to put up a new building? 
  [Bauer] We are very well aware that the construction of a 
new parliamentary center would be a very expensive luxury. So 
we are moving here without any refurbishment, and the Duma 
adopted a special decision on this, for the express purpose of 
avoiding any misapprehension. We only had to sort out the 
conference hall: Install the electronics and all that is needed 
for work. 
  [Skukin] But what did it cost? 
  [Bauer] The total cost was set at $8 million. The planned 
cost of a new parliamentary center was around $500 million. I 
believe both the president and parliament will return to this 
question in time, because the country, of course, needs a 
proper, modern parliamentary center. At the moment we simply 
cannot afford one. 
  [Skukin] The State Duma is accused of adopting too few of 
the laws everyone wants. 
  [Bauer] More than 50 laws are waiting in the wings. They 
have already been scrutinized at committee level, and all the 
necessary consultations have been conducted. But need we be 
hasty in such crucial work? Anyway, the task is impossible: To 
adopt 200 laws in two years. It is unrealistic. Nonetheless, I 
believe the Duma has the potential to fulfill the hopes pinned 
on it by the voters. The main thing is that the documents we 
adopt should not be divorced from life and should be fully 
functional. 
  [Skukin] But the Duma law on the procedure for media 
coverage of the activities of the organs of authority was seen 
by many journalists as a blatant assault on their right to 
comment freely on the power structures' activities. 
  [Bauer] I am opposed to regulation of press activities. 
Anyway, you have the courts, which are supposed to be the real 
regulators of interrelationships. But that is something we are 
not used to at the moment. As a result, the press's financial 
dependence on the organs of power, without any law, has already 
made them totally subject to the executive authority. Most 
provincial papers are becoming toothless. I fear that the same 
fate lies in store for the central press. Attempts to criticize 
the administration are blocked by the editorial collectives 
themselves, worried about their survival. But I believe there 
must be criticism of state authority; not abusive, though. 
Abroad, for example, there is a very high level of criticism of 
parliamentarians, but there is also a high level of media 
responsibility. Here, social consciousness acts in one sphere 
only -- ferreting out the deputies' shortcomings and revealing 
their inadequacies. In so doing I believe journalists are 
demeaning themselves: The deputies were elected by the Russian 
people with the help of those very same Russian media. 
  But I hope that now, with the move to what is for us a new 
building, we will see a new stage in the State Duma's work. And 
the media will not only record this in their pages but will do 
their utmost to promote it. 
  [Skukin] Vladimir Anatolyevich, the president's letter 
commenting on the law on the status of deputies talked of 
certain privileges that would be unlikely to meet with the 
approval of voters and taxpayers. At a recent Duma session, 
Georgiy Satarov, the president's assistant, listed a number of 
privileges current deputies have which former deputies did not 
have. 
  [Bauer] The president's letter was commenting on the law on 
the status of deputies adopted by the State Duma and, I stress, 
approved by the Federation Council. It is a bicameral decision, 
so we have a common view of all the law's provisions. 
Accordingly, all these norms relate to the deputies of both 
chambers. But the general tenor of the comment suggests that 
the privileges are excessive, and the criticism is directed 
mainly at the State Duma deputies. 
  [Skukin] OK, but let us deal with the facts cited by the 
president's assistant. The status of the former deputies did 
not stipulate, for example, that parliamentarians should be paid 
for the entire term of election in the event of the dissolution 
of the legislative body. 
  [Bauer] True, that norm was not in the standing orders of 
the former Congress of People's Deputies. But our former 
mentality did not even contemplate the possibility of the 
enforced dissolution of parliament. The makers of this law were 
merely reacting to the changed situation. Incidentally, we did 
not exceed by much the normatives for state employees dismissed 
in line with staff cuts or as a result of reorganization. It is 
a morally justified norm. A deputy was elected for two years 
and this became part of his life plan -- on giving up what was 
in many cases an important post. 
  [Skukin] In the old law there was nothing about 
government-level medical services.... 
  [Bauer] But the old deputies certainly had use of them. 
Anyway, why shouldn't a deputy, elected by hundreds of thousands 
of people, ask for the same medical services as a government 
official? 
  [Skukin] According to G. Satarov, the payment of expenses 
for travel to Moscow is a new privilege, and if a deputy is not 
provided with an apartment he gets a loan in order to be able to 
acquire and own accommodations. 
  [Bauer] I can definitely say that most deputies elected to 
represent the provinces are living in conditions that are 
demeaning for a parliamentarian. Knowing the practice in some 
foreign countries in this matter, I can say that nowhere are 
out-of-town deputies treated in this way. Despite the norms of 
the law -- the granting of official housing for a three-month 
period, without privatization rights -- out-of-town deputies 
have practically no prospect of living in normal conditions. It 
will soon be six months since we were elected. You get family 
men with children living in hotels. And anyone who has lived in 
a hotel will know full well that there are no conditions there 
for relaxation, for preparing food, for the children to do their 
homework. Finding ourselves in a difficult situation, we were 
forced to seek a solution. In my view, if a deputy were to be 
allocated compensation within the bounds of what is spent on a 
hotel and the state were to be spared the worry of housing him, 
it would benefit both the state and the deputy. 
  [Skukin] Vladimir Anatolyevich, how do you see the increase 
in the number of deputies' assistants? 
  [Bauer] Yes, the number has increased. But it should not be 
forgotten that the electoral district is three or four times 
bigger. There used to be seven or eight districts per million 
inhabitants, but now there are only two. Some deputies 
represent around 20 rural rayons and others were elected to 
represent cities with populations of 500,000 and more. Without 
assistants it is simply impossible to keep in touch with the 
people while doing a professional job in the Duma. The 
umbilical cord, figuratively speaking, will be cut. And that's 
that, the deputy is finished. 
  Incidentally, we clearly pointed out in the law that up to 
five assistants were permitted, but with only one working in the 
State Duma and the rest in the provinces. This is not a 
privilege at all, in fact it is now much easier for voters to 
contact a deputy. 
  [Skukin] How are events developing at the moment? 
  [Bauer] I am impressed by the fact that the president found 
a mutually acceptable procedure, signed the law, but asked the 
State Duma to take a sympathetic view of his comments. The 
conciliation commission, on which both chambers and the 
president are represented, is now functioning. I am head of its 
Duma part. If we fail to persuade the president's side that the 
particular norms are adequate, we will incorporate the 
president's comments in the law as amendments. Incidentally, so 
far there have been no complaints about unrealistic privileges 
from the State Legal Administration under the president. 
Comments have been made mainly in connection with certain 
changes in constitutional norms.

<F P=106> [Report by Marina Denisova: "The Uncertain Future of </F>
Parliamentary Television" -- from IZVESTIYA-TV section] 
  [Text] Last week the State Duma decreed the setting up of 
its own television and radio service. It was a difficult 
process, it took a number of votes, and was passed by 10 votes 
in the end. Viewers have not yet forgotten "Parliamentary Hour," 
which for the people was synonymous with a very boring and 
biased political program imposed from on high. Will history 
repeat itself and replicate a failed experiment? The days when 
parliamentary spectacles replaced shows for the people are past. 
The State Duma deputies are probably aware of this. 
Nonetheless... 
  Yuliy Nisnevich, chairman of the parliamentary Subcommittee 
on Computer Science and Communications, commented on the State 
Duma decree at the request of IZVESTIYA-TV: 
  [Nisnevich] Among deputies there are two entirely different 
approaches to the creation of a State Duma television and radio 
service. One group believes that it must form its own 
full-fledged television and radio company. This is clear from 
the adopted decree and from the amendments to the law in 
preparation "On Coverage of the Work of State Organs of Power in 
the State Media." For example, amendments of the following kind: 
The State Duma press service must have direct access to the 
airwaves. 
  But there are deputies who hold a directly opposite view: 
This television and radio service should be a department of the 
Duma press service dealing with such technical matters as 
television and radio recording of sittings of our parliament and 
its committees and commissions and compilation of archive 
material so that any journalist or interested organization can 
obtain these materials to work on. 
  All is not straightforward. The thing is that there is 
nothing in the Constitution entitling the State Duma to make 
decisions like the creation of its own television and radio 
company. Legally any state company can ignore this decree. 
  We have encountered manifestations of a public struggle for 
the airwaves. Some deputies believe that television provides 
insufficient coverage of their activities and their attitudes 
are unknown to society. So they want to have their own airtime 
and say what they see fit. 
  A draft decree was submittd by deputies from the Democratic 
Party of Russia -- Travkin's party. It is actively supported by 
the Communists and the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia], which periodically organizes actions in the State Duma 
in connection with the fact that the party is not being given 
airtime. 
  "Russia's Choice" and "Yabloko" [Yavlinskiy bloc] are of the 
opposite view. The PRUA [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] and 
"12 December Alliance" partly share the same platform. The 
democratic factions believe that the task is not to create their 
own television and radio company, but to be given the 
opportunity to talk about events taking place in the State Duma 
in proportion to the coverage of the activities of the 
government and the president. Unfortunately, the balance is 
actually upset at the moment. The State Duma's work is not 
reflected objectively enough and in sufficient detail on 
television. For example, the Duma took a very significant step 
when it adopted on first reading part of the Civil Code. This 
is effectively the "foundation" of legislation, but our 
television and radio companies somehow pass by such significant 
matters without informing viewers and listeners of them. 
  If there is an important event taking place in the Duma, 
society must be kept informed, perhaps with comments by the 
leaders of various factions. We need programs that promote the 
inculcation of the ideas of parliamentarianism within society. 
We can manage without rigid, fixed airtime for 
parliamentarians. But a clear understanding is needed. All 
deputies and factions must be treated fairly. 
  We believe that all deputies with different views must have 
equal opportunities to appear on television, regional as well as 
central. 
  The decree on creating the television and radio service was 
put to a vote repeatedly. When the LDPR faction stormed out of 
the hall there were obviously not enough votes. But the "Women 
of Russia" faction then played its part: First the deputies 
wavered, but in the end they voted for the motion. 
  Our committee has now been instructed to elaborate a 
blueprint for television coverage of parliament's activities. 
Of course, the Duma will now seek to create its own television 
and radio company. But it will cost an enormous amount, millions 
of dollars! The Duma is unlikely to be allocated that kind of 
money. 
  Will "Parliamentary Hour" return on the "Rossiya" television 
channel? That depends on how the All-Russian State Television 
and Radio Company conducts itself. As I said before, according 
to the legislation, it need not play these games. Most likely 
some compromise will be found. 
  In my view, this decree is another excuse for speculation by 
representatives of the various factions, for another political 
spectacle. [Nisnevich ends] 
  The deputies' wish to have their own television company is 
understandable, although it looks to the public like a strange 
caprice. They will probably want to take the money to set it up 
out of the state purse. But the government has failed of late 
to find sufficient funds to finance existing state television 
companies. Television is being called "destitute." In this 
situation the creation of a television and radio service to 
satisfy the deputies' vanity is another piece of political 
nonsense. Unfortunately, we have gotten used to this kind of 
thing, grimly waiting for the moment when sober-mindedness and 
common sense prevail.
