  [Text] Sergey Tereshchenko chaired a regular sitting of the 
Cabinet of Ministers today. The topic of discussion was the 
1994 state budget. Most discussions centered on the apparently 
insufficient proposals by departmental ministries with regard to 
cutting budget expenditures. 
  If these proposals are taken as a basis, not only will the 
expenditures not be cut; rather, the earlier envisaged deficit 
will increase threefold. The participants of the sitting 
expressed fair doubts that the income part of the budget, which 
had been confirmed earlier, was feasible. Many enterprises and 
even branches of industry are currently loss-generating, while 
credit turnover is extremely low. 
  A decision was made to petition for review by the Supreme 
Kenges the possibility of a gradual stage-by-stage increase of 
prices for bread and bakery products that currently are 
subsidized. The need for measures to protect the poorest 
segments of the population was also raised.

Ruble Zone"] 
  [Text] Many Kazakhstanis think it was a mistake to bring 
in their own currency last November. 
  This is shown by an opinion poll taken in the Republic by 
Alma-Ata's [Almaty's] Giller Institute. Some 62.5 percent of 
those residents of the capital who were polled are convinced 
that the country should return to the ruble zone. Only 21 
percent of respondents categorically oppose this step. In the 
six months the national currency has been in existence, its 
value has fallen more than eight times over.

  [Text] In joining the NATO Partnership for Peace program, 
Kyrgyzstan hopes to receive assistance on the part of NATO 
within the scope of the consultations on national security. 
Kyrgyzstan also expects NATO to help it to work out a military 
doctrine. 
  Speaking at a press conference in Bishkek today, Kyrgyz 
President Askar Akayev commented on the results of his visit to 
NATO headquarters. He underlined that within the scope of this 
program NATO was ready to assist with drafting projects for 
conversion of the Kyrgyz military industry. The parties could 
also cooperate on environmental projects. 
  In particular, Bishkek wishes for NATO to provide practical 
aid to overcome natural disasters which are a regular occurrence 
in Kyrgyzstan. 
  Akayev pointed out that although Kyrgyzstan is a small 
state, 
the general situation in Central Asia and its interests in 
stability and security mean that it must have its own army.

  [Text] The Kuat power generation company has issued a 
progress report for May. In comparison with the previous months 
of the current year, electricity production fell to 846 million 
kWh. Nevertheless, it is more than for the same period last 
year. 
  Owing to fuel shortages the electricity plants are running 
into hardships, with most production accounted for by the Naryn 
cascade, which comprises five hydroelectric power stations 
working at full capacity. Two power generating units function 
at the Shemyldysayskaya plant, which is still under 
construction. The Republic plans to generate about 11.5 billion 
kWh this year.

  [Text] For the third successive day, servicemen of the 
Defense Ministry of Tajikistan and representatives of the 
Russian Army in Tajikistan and of the Internal Affairs Ministry 
are manning checkpoints in Dushanbe. Their joint action stems 
from the fact that in recent days the sociopolitical situation 
in Dushanbe has deteriorated slightly. Several military 
servicemen have fallen victim to bullets fired by criminal 
elements. This is why joint security groups are observing the 
sociopolitical situation in the city at the orders of the 
republican leadership and also observing the agreement of the 
military leaders of the Russian Federation in Tajikistan. 
  According to the press office of the Internal Affairs 
Ministry, criminal incidents have decreased compared to several 
days ago as a result of joint efforts by the joint security 
bodies.

  [Text] Dushanbe 7 June TASS -- Armed squads of the Tajik 
Security, Interior, and Defence Ministries, as well as of the 
Russian military contingent deployed in Dushanbe, today began to 
patrol the streets of the Tajik capital round-the-clock. These 
security measures were approved on Monday by the coordination 
council of Tajik law enforcement bodies, which met here under 
the chairmanship of First Vice-Speaker of the Tajik Supreme 
Soviet Abdulmadjid Dostiyev. The vice-speaker said that they 
were prompted by the current dangerous criminogenic situation in 
the city, which had, in fact, gone out of control in recent days. 
  As earlier reported, a wave of terroristic acts swept the 
Tajik capital this May. Their victims included prominent Tajik 
businessmen and journalists, as well as officers of the Russian 
military contingent and the national armed forces. 
  The patrol squads are vested with extensive rights, 
including 
the right to inspect all types of transport vehicles, check the 
documents of citizens, and confiscate unlawfully possessed 
weapons. The areas, where Russian servicemen and their families 
are housed, are being guarded with particular care. 
  The patrols are allowed to open fire in case of resistance 
or 
refusal to obey their orders.

  [Text] The chain of terrorist acts launched against Russian 
Army officers in Tajikistan in the past few days is a campaign 
planned in advance for the purpose of destabilizing the 
situation locally, Russia's Deputy Defence Minister, Cl.- 
General Georgiy Kondratev, told INTERFAX on Monday [6 June]. 
  According to him, the hard-line opposition has not abandoned 
its intention to resolve the Tajik problem by force, including 
military measures. As the general said, at the moment the 
opposition is concentrating its forces not only on the border 
with Afghanistan, but also within Tajikistan. Russia's 201st 
motorized infantry division stationed in Tajikistan is capable, 
in cooperation with Russian frontier guards and Tajik Government 
forces, of thwarting any military actions the opposition may 
launch from within Tajikistan and from neighboring Afghanistan, 
Kondratev declared.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] The murders of seven Russian servicemen committed in 
Tajikistan last week are a result of "a cold-blooded campaign 
planned in advance," said the commander of Russian frontier 
troops stationed in Tajikistan, Lt.-General Anatoliy Chechulin. 
IF Note: Sevem servicemen have been killed in Dushanbe in the 
past few days. The latest victim was Lt.-Colonel Sergey 
Leontikov, who was murdered Saturday [4 June] morning in a 
residential area of the Tajik capital. 
  "These brutal, well-organized and purposeful crimes pose the 
start of methodical terror against Russian servicemen," 
Chechulin told a news conference in Dushanbe. He accused a 
leading member of the Tajik opposition and Islamic Revival 
Movement, Akbar Turajonzoda, and the head of the so-called 
"government in exile", Said Abdullo Nuri, of having provoked 
these actions. 
  Russia's Deputy Defence Minister, Cl.-General Georgiy 
Kondratyev, also explained the series of terrorist acts with the 
unwillingness of the hard-line opposition to "give up its 
intention to resolve the Tajik problem by force, including 
military measures." According to the general, at the moment the 
opposition is concentrating its forces not only on the border 
with Afghanistan, but also within Tajikistan. 
  Russia's 201st motorized infantry division stationed in 
Tajikistan, in cooperation with Russian frontier guards and 
Tajik armed forces, is capable of stopping any military actions 
launched by the opposition within Tajikistan and from 
neighboring Afghanistan, Kondratyev said. 
  Chechulin demanded that Tajikistan's law-enforcement 
agencies 
investigate the murders without delay. 
  Earlier First Deputy Chairman of the Tajik parliament, 
Abdulmajid Dostiev, tried to assure Interfax's correspondent 
that there are no political grounds for the murders of Russian 
servicemen. According to him, these are purely criminal 
offences, and the authorities are doing their best to find those 
who committed them. 
  Some observers link Dushanbe's unwillingness to accept the 
version of political terror with its reluctance to aggravate 
relations with the opposition on the eve of another round of 
inter-Tajik talks which is to take place in Tehran on 14 June. 
  In the meantime spokesmen for the opposition Movement for 
Islamic Revival (MIR) qualified the Russian officials' 
assertions as to the involvement of the Tajik opposition in the 
terrorist acts as conflicting with reality. 
  In its statement released on Monday the movement said: 
"Certain circles are used to blame everything on the opposition. 
The acts of terror and violence committed in Dushanbe and other 
areas of Tajikistan reflect the intrigues of those forces which 
are not interested in a peaceful solution to the conflict, and 
which seek to hinder the process of talks. It's they who 
unleashed the civil war in Tajikistan for the purpose of seizing 
power, not for the purpose of restoring peace, law and order." 
  The statement points out that the Tajik opposition would 
like 
Russia to be "more impartial and neutral toward the conflicting 
sides." 
  The MIR welcomed Russia's suggestion that the opposition 
should join political reforms, such as debates on a new 
constitution, underway in Tajikistan. "However it's practically 
impossible to implement this initiative in the present 
circumstances. If a new constitution is adopted at submachine 
gun point, without the participation of about one million 
refugees, we will not recognize it," the statement points out. 
According to the MIR, "at first we must settle the conflict 
politically, ensure return for all the refugees, guarantee 
freedom of the press, speech, political parties and movements, 
and begin to discuss a new constitution nationwide in order to 
adopt it only after that."

  [Text] The Tajik opposition would like Russia to be "more 
impartial and neutral toward the conflicting sides." This is 
announced in a statement Interfax received from the Tajik 
Movement for Islamic Revival (MIR). The statement was signed by 
one of the movement's leaders, Hoji Akbar Turajonzoda. 
  According to the statement, the assertion of Russia's First 
Deputy Foreign Minister, Anatoly Adamishin, that the opposition 
was involved in terrorist acts launched in Tajikistan, runs 
counter to reality. Adamishin made the statement in an 
interview with INTERFAX on 27 May. 
  "Certain circles are used to blaming everything on the 
opposition," the statement says. "Acts of terror and violence 
committed in Dushanbe and other areas of Tajikistan reflect 
intrigues by the forces which are not interested in resolving 
the conflict peacefully, and which seek to hinder the process of 
talks. It's they who unleashed the civil war in Tajikistan for 
the purpose of seizing power, not for the purpose of restoring 
peace, law and order." 
  The MIR hopes that "Russia will not divide Tajik citizens 
into friends and enemies." "A mediator should be neutral, 
disinterested and just. If he departs from these principles and 
takes the side of one of the parties concerned, he loses the 
right to act as a mediator," the statement says.

out that Russia remains the main guarantor of stability in 
Central Asia.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Nadashkevich and </F>
Vilor Niyazmatov] 
  [Text] Tashkent 6 June TASS -- Uzbek President Islam 
Karimov and South Korean President Kim Young-sam stated the 
similarity of their positions on international and regional 
issues at their joint news conference in Tashkent on Monday. 
  "As a result of the negotiations we have received mutual 
dividends," Karimov said, stressing the importance of the 
growing mutually advantageous ties between Uzbekistan and South 
Korea. 
  There are about 20 joint ventures in Uzbekistan which have 
established firm positions in the Uzbek market. "We want the 
conditions established for foreign investors to be first of all 
used by South Korea," he added. 
  Kim Young-sam stressed that both countries have a huge 
economic potential and pointed out that Uzbekistan is carrying 
out a realistic programme of reform which can be used in other 
central Asian republics. The South Korean leader pledged 
overall support for Uzbek reform. 
  Kim Young-sam and Karimov have already signed four 
agreements 
on cooperation in the field of culture, free movement of the 
citizens of the two republics, air transportation and 
cooperation between the Uzbek and South Korean foreign 
ministries. 
  Later today the South Korean president accompanied by the 
key 
ministers and representatives of business circles will fly to 
Vladivostok.

  [Text] Several accords were signed at the end of 
Uzbek-South Korean talks in Tashkent on Monday [6 June] -- a 
cultural cooperation agreement, a bilateral free travel 
memorandum, an air service agreement, and a protocol on 
consultations and other contacts at foreign ministerial level. 
  Commenting on the outcome of the talks, South Korea's 
President Kim Yong-sam told journalists that the accords 
provided for "frontal cooperation between the two countries in 
all fields of science, culture, and technology." "We regard 
Uzbekistan as an important potential partner," he stressed. In 
his opinion the most prospective cooperation fields are 
electronics, communication, telecommunication, and gas 
extraction and refinement. 
  "The two countries could prosper more by combining 
Uzbekistan's natural wealth with South Korea's technologies and 
finances," Kim Yong-sam said. 
  Noting the proximity of views with Seoul on a number of 
international and regional problems, Uzbekistan's President 
Islam Karimov spoke in favour of applying South Korea's 
experience in consolidating Uzbekistan as a state politically 
and otherwise. He described the Korean form of government as 
democracy rather than arbitrary rule and said that a factor such 
as strong executive power used by South Korea during its reform 
suited Uzbekistan as well. 
  Asked by INTERFAX about Tashkent's attitude toward NATO's 
Partnership for Peace program, Karimov said: "Uzbekistan has 
nothing against the idea of Partnership for Peace. Uzbekistan 
will sign this document. But we want to do so above all for 
national interests rather than reasons of fashion. Haste in 
this matter would be dangerous and improper," he said. 
  From Tashkent, Kim Yong-sam is going to Vladivostok tonight.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Berezovskiy: "Timur Rises in Place of </F>
Marx"] 
  [Text] Tashkent -- In the center of Tashkent, where only 
recently there towered a pensive granite Karl Marx, Amir Timur 
has ascended the pedestal, in gilt spurs. The fearsome 
conqueror of the East, whose empire stretched from Delhi to 
Damascus, henceforth symbolizes the might of the state and the 
unity of the Uzbek nation. Over here he is now like Prince 
Vladimir for Russians or Bismarck for Germans. 
  Uzbekistan's best minds have been thrown into the creation 
of 
a new ideology. The powerful wave of "perestroyka" nationalism, 
which smashed to pieces the dogmas of Marxism-Leninism, has 
receded. But what will take its place? All the signs suggest 
that the resulting vacuum will be filled by Islam. 
  A Western diplomat, arriving in Tashkent, was pleasantly 
surprised that Uzbeks remain...Uzbeks. He was not exactly 
discovering America. The people have not lost their national 
psychology. An Uzbek, just as he was hundreds of years ago, is 
loyal to his family and the norms of the Shari'ah; respectful of 
authority -- which, as a rule, he personifies; tolerant in 
interethnic relations, practical, and sociable. Not to mention 
the fact that he has kept his own cuisine, songs, dances, and 
customs.... 
  It is from this well that the authors of the new ideology 
draw their ideas. The aim is to unite the people around the 
leader, lead them through the wilderness, and give them hope. 
And whereas formerly this was the unattainable peak of 
communism, nowadays the country's streets and squares are 
adorned with another inspiring formula: "Uzbekistan -- A State 
With A Great Future!" The author, of course, is Islam Karimov, 
who, unlike certain other CIS leaders, perfectly understands 
that, however bad Soviet ideology was, it make it possible to 
unite the nation to work for the good of the republic. He also 
perfectly understands that a nation cannot exist in an 
ideological vacuum. 
  The supporting structure of the emerging ideology is 
patriotism. 
  For instance, the Basmaks [anti-Soviet Uzbek nationalist 
movement in early twenties] are now esteemed as "champions of 
the faith and freedom." Like others who fell in the struggle 
against the "Red Empire," they will have a monument raised in 
their honor in Kokand. Writers and poets accused of nationalism 
and repressed under Stalin are being rehabilitated -- people 
like Usman Nasyr, for whom one of Tashkent's central streets has 
been named. 
  One of the purposes of the new ideology is to overcome 
regionalism, the age-old separation of Uzbeks into Fergana, 
Khorezm, Bukhara, and Tashkent Uzbeks, which can still be seen 
today in the structure of the ruling elite. Disconnection and 
isolation have led to this people being virtually "absent" from 
world civilization for three centuries. 
  There are people and political forces who are trying to 
build 
a new social consciousness on "pushing away" from Russia and the 
Soviet Union, whom they represent as colonizers. Their sins are 
endless: russification, the forced imposition of socialism, the 
exportation of national treasures for a pittance. 
  The main target of the "reforging" is, of course, the 
younger 
generation. It is easier for young people to rid themselves of 
Soviet stereotypes and take on board new ideas. Hence, the 
entire education system is being hurriedly restructured. In 
just a few years Uzbekistan is to change its alphabet from the 
Cyrillic to the Latin, which will undoubtedly "cut off" the 
younger generation from the huge bulk of Soviet and Russian 
literature. Meanwhile, Tashkent has sharply reduced "Ostankino" 
and almost completely "cut out" RTV. 
  The old, for whom it is too late to change their views, have 
not been forgotten either. In Uzbekistan, 1 May -- Victory Day 
-- and 8 March have been left untouched. Monuments to Pushkin 
and Gorkiy have not disappeared, and Fergana's central street 
bears the name of Dmitriy Skobelev, the czarist general who 
built the city. 
  The ruling People's Democratic Party with its leader Islam 
Karimov aspires most of all to be the architect of the new 
ideology. The president never tires of repeating that the 
people are not ready for democracy of the Western type, and will 
not accept it entirely. And the spiritual face of Uzbekistan is 
probably being molded as a synthesis of the Turkestan 
renaissance, renascent Islam, and modern civilization.

  [Text] Stepanakert, June 6 (SNARK)--The relative peace in 
Karabakh, lasting for three weeks already, was violated last 
night by shellings of the positions of Karabakh Defence Army 
forces at the south-east (Martuninskiy) sector of the front. 
The Azerbaijani side used grenade launchers and various types 
of automatic weapons. As SNARK was informed in the Karabakh 
State Department of Information and Press, there had been no 
retaliate fire from the Karabakh side. No reports on the 
consequences. 
  Despite such actions, the observers tend to think that the 
truce is kept, on the whole.

  [Text] Yerevan ("AZG" daily), 06/04/94 -- As we have 
already reported, a delegation of the Russian Ministry of Energy 
visited Armenia. The delegation involves some twenty 
specialists in nuclear energy. 
  An "Azg" correspondent met the director of "Energia" 
enterprise, Director of the Russian institute of Nuclear Plants 
Use, Doctor of Technical Sciences, Prof. Armen Abaghian. 
  - Mr. Abaghian, why did you arrive to Yerevan? 
  - This is a working visit. You probably know that Russian 
Federation and Armenia signed an agreement on reopening the 
Armenian Nuclear Power Plant, and the majority of work will be 
carried by our specialists. We arrived to get acquainted with 
current state of the power plant and to define basic directions 
of our activity. 
  - What are the conditions at the plant? 
  - After preliminary operations, the plant is ready to 
reconstruction. 
  - There have been rumors that most of the equipment is 
stolen, is this true? 
  - This are senseless rumors. It's not easy to steal things 
from here. All main elements are in normal conditions. 
  - What's the main problem today? 
  - Financing. Some 100 million dollars are needed for 
reopening the block. Everything else is clear. 
  - Do you have security specialists in your delegation? 
  - Sure, the problems of physical security have been 
discussed in detail. These are all soluble problems and one 
shouldn't dramatize these. 
  - If the problem of financing is solved, do you think that 
the plant may be started up by winter. 
  - Yes, this is possible.

  [Text] Baku -- "No word may be of any reform, much more of 
privatization, in a state of war. Azerbaijan is not ready for 
all that. In present conditions, privatization would mean 
squandering of public property and seizure of people's wealth by 
mafia groups", told the Azerbaijani Prime-Minister Suret 
Guseynov at the Ministers' Cabinet meeting May 27. 
  The state of credit system in the republic was discussed at 
the meeting. Guseynov spoke again in favor of state enterprise 
support by credits. He noticed specially that priority should 
be given to oil and gas industry and agriculture. 
  Earlier, during the March meeting, Guseynov also emphasized 
that reforms in economy cannot be carried out in conditions of 
war. 
  While the total amount of credits increased during the last 
year for 5.9 times, the sum of over-time payments grew for 28.6 
times. "The major burden of overdue payments lies on fuel and 
power complex, and on agricultural facilities", observed 
Guseynov. 
  In order to improve the financial discipline, Guseynov 
ordered the ministries and concerns to pass the state companies' 
accounts to the state banks. In their turn, the state banks 
shall grant credits to the fuel and power industries. 
  Suret Guseynov noted that the situation did not change 
though 
a number of top-rank officials were dismissed. He stressed the 
importance of strengthening the administrative measures and 
spoke in favor of addition powers for Ministers' Cabinet.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Dolidze report: "Georgian Watergate"] </F>
  [Text] Tbilisi -- The furor concerning accusations that 
Shevardnadze has been using the state apparatus to form his own 
party is coming to a head. 
  The parliamentary deputies who are members of Shevardnadze's 
party, which is called the Union of Citizens of Georgia, have 
come under sharp criticism from retired Prime Minister Tengiz 
Sigua, who has accused Shevardnadze of abusing his official 
position for political ends, stating that "it is immoral for 
someone in the leadership to create his own political force." 
  Sigua said that he has documents which show that the head of 
the Georgian state apparatus is taking part in the creation of 
regional sections of the Union of Citizens. In response, 
Shevardnadze called the former premier a liar, stating that if 
"the protocols of the elders of the Union of Citizens confirm 
the apparatus' involvement in setting up regional party 
organizations, the head of the republic will have sufficient 
conscience not to enter parliament again." 
  Meanwhile, Sigua's accusations have been borne out in part, 
as it is not Shevardnadze's actual signature but a facsimile 
which figures at the bottom of one of the December protocols of 
proceedings where the creation of regional party branches is 
indeed entrusted to the deputy head of Shevardnadze's apparatus. 
  The head of state should be given his due -- he raised the 
question of setting up a parliamentary commission with extensive 
opposition representation which will study all the circumstances 
of the affair and then deliver its verdict. The decision on the 
makeup of the commission will be made at an emergency session of 
parliament. 
  A furor is thus shaping up. The setting up of a 
parliamentary commission is, as Shevardnadze asserts, essential 
if the participation of the apparatus of the state leader in 
purely party affairs is not to set a precedent in Georgia for 
the future. One parliamentary opposition leader who enjoys 
great respect, the Republican Ivlian Khaindrava, has dubbed the 
event the "Georgian Watergate."

  [Text] Tbilisi, June 6 (SNARK)--Rezo Adamia, secretary of 
the Georgian Parliament Commission on Defence and National 
Security told SNARK today Georgia insists on joint command over 
Russian military bases, stationed in Georgia. In his opinion, 
the command over the Russian bases should be implemented on 
coordination with Commander- in-Chief of Georgian Army. 
  Besides, we suggest that in the Russian troops, should also 
serve Georgians, but the Russian side is very suspicious in this 
question. Among the serious discords at the negotiations is also 
the problem of the terms of the troops' staying. Russia insists 
on the term of 25 years, but Rezo Adamia considers that the 
agreement should be signed for 5 years. It will allow to revise 
it and to move necessary amendments every 5 years. "We should 
follow the example of the American bases in Philippines," said 
the MP.

  [Text] The Geneva talks on the settlement of the conflict 
between Georgia and Abkhazia have been re-scheduled from June 9 
to 15 because the problem of the deployment of peace-keepers 
into the zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict remains 
unresolved. 
  The press-service for the Abkhazian Ambassador in Moscow 
said 
the postponement was caused by the refusal of the Russian 
Federation Council to agree to the deployment of the 
peace-keeping force along the confrontation line along the 
Inguri River from June 10 to 15. 
  The Federation Council, which considered the problem last 
week, decided the reasons in favor of Russian troop deployment 
in the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone as outlined in the 
letter to the upper house of the Federal Assembly by President 
Yeltsin were insufficient. Members of the Federation Council 
also pointed to the absence of a legal basis to determining the 
status of the Russian troops outside the country. 
  Meanwhile, following the decision of the Federation Council, 
the Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze said in Tbilisi that 
Russian president Yeltsin had assured him in a telephone 
conversation of the early deployment of Russian peace-keepers 
into conflict zone.

  [Text] Tbilisi -- A special-purpose paratroop brigade has 
appeared within Georgia's State Security Service. According to 
the service's chairman, Igor Giorgadze, brigade personnel have 
been trained at Russian special services training centers. The 
"special-purpose forces" include motorized rifle and combat 
engineer subunits and an antiterrorist squad. The "special 
forces" will cost the taxpayer around 5 billion Russian rubles a 
year. But, according to independent experts, the brigade will be 
capable of more than covering the expenditure on its upkeep. 
Provided of course that certain conditions are created for it 
to fight crime.

<F P=106> [Kakha Beradze report: "The Registration of Commercial </F>
Banks Was Halted in Georgia on 25 May"] 
  [Text] As has been pointed out in the National Bank, there 
has been a more than sufficient increase in their number. As of 
24 May, the number of commercial banks that had been registered 
amounted to 210, of which 138 were set up during the last year 
and a half. 
  According to specialists, such an increase in the number of 
commercial banks has been due to the inflation of the coupon. 
The exchange rate of the coupon is increasing constantly 
whereas the minimum capital fund for newly created banks 
remains, as before, 500 million coupons. If, in January, this 
amount was equivalent to $3,000, it was worth $480 by mid-May. 
It is unrealistic to open an enterprise with this amount, yet 
it is wholly possible to open a commercial bank, which Georgian 
businessmen, moreover, are using to their advantage. It is 
precisely for this reason that commercial banks have sprung up 
like mushrooms; the National Bank has put a temporary halt to 
their further increase until new rates are established for the 
minimum capital fund.

  [Text] The Saeima presidium accepted Foreign Minister 
Georgs Andrejevs' resignation as Saeima deputy. The presidium 
instructed the Central Electoral Commission to determine which 
of the candidate deputies from the Way of Latvia union will take 
Andrejevs' place. According to unofficial information, Saeima 
Deputy Georgs Andrejevs will be replaced by Maris Zvaigzne, head 
of the Foreign Ministry's department of archives and chancellery. 
  On 4 June Andrejevs submitted a letter to Prime Minister 
Valdis Birkavs asking him to accept his resignation as foreign 
minister, and today Andrejevs submitted a letter to the 
presidium of the Saeima on giving up his mandate. 
  Georgs Andrejevs has also distributed a statement sayimg 
that 
the Supreme Council's electoral law, which he believes was 
formulated erroneously, has been preserved by the law adopted in 
the Saeima on 19 May. The statement also says that the events 
in recent days after the publication of the open letter in the 
press on 28 May prevent him from continuing work not only as a 
Saeima deputy, but also as foreign minister. 
  In accordance with international standards in legislation, 
each person's guilt is determined by his specific activities and 
not by where he belonged. This also applies to collaboration, 
because the need for more exact definitions is dismissed in 
advance. By disregarding this, we are moving further away from 
the Western world into which we want to become integrated. 
  Only a proven fact may serve as an argument for restricting 
the activity of an individual and for punishment of a different 
kind, considers Georgs Andrejevs, expressing the hope that his 
resignation will assist the public and the legislators in 
realizing the need for changes in the legislation of the 
Republic of Latvia. 
  Information: The electoral law of the Fifth Saeima provides 
that any citizen of the Republic of Latvia can be nominated as a 
candidate deputy if he has signed a statement that he has not 
been nor is now a staff or nonstaff employee of the USSR or 
Latvian SSR state security committees; of the USSR Ministry of 
Defense; of Russian security services, army intelligence 
services, or counterintelligence services; an inheritor of the 
rights of the USSR and of other countries; or an agent, 
resident, or keeper of a safe house belonging to these bodies.

  [Text] Riga, 6 Jun -- Latvian Foreign Minister Georgs 
Andrejevs on Monday asked the government to accept his 
resignation. He also gave up his seat as a member of the Saeima 
today. His powers as a deputy were suspended by parliament at 
the end of April because the minister's name was discovered in a 
card index of agents of the former KGB. 
  At the same time, Andrejevs issued a statement in which he 
expresses the hope that his resignation will "help society and 
legislators realize the need to make changes to Latvia's laws." 
He believes that only a proven fact should serve as the reason 
for punishing or limiting the activity of an individual. It is 
the imperfect nature of Latvia's laws, in which the concept of 
"collaboration" is in need of clarification, and also the 
reaction in the country to his open letter in which he described 
what his contacts with the KGB had been, that made the minister 
decide to resign. 
  As already reported, Latvian laws do not permit those who 
collaborated with the KGB to be deputies or occupy certain state 
posts.

transportation. 
  The agreement is designed to promote passenger and freight 
transports between the two countries, as well as transit via 
their territories, the Riga-based DIENA newspaper reported. 
  Latvia and Norway have already started successful 
cooperation 
by signing a contract on the supply of Norwegian Alkatel firm's 
telecommunications equipment to Latvia in the framework of the 
Tilts program. 
  Olbu claims that Latvian and Norwegian cooperation will 
broaden in the future, especially in the sphere of 
telecomunications. 
  The signed agreement takes effect starting with the day of 
its signature and remains valid until any of the parties 
announce an intention to break it six months in advance.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Nevelskiy report: "No Need to Beware of Space </F>
Communications"] 
  [Text] St. Petersburg -- A hitherto top-secret 
installation 20 kilometers from Ventspils and owned by the 
Russian Defense Ministry's Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) 
opened its doors Monday to Latvian parliamentarians, the 
scientific public, and journalists. 
  This former military camp, where a handful of specialists 
and 
soldiers remain, is still kept in ideal order. There is no 
spitting or discarding of cigarette butts here. Everything is 
spotlessly clean. And yet the camp is not so small. It is 
located in the depths of the border zone, covering 40 hectares 
of a beautiful pine forest. There are five apartment blocks of 
100 apartments each on its territory, along with a kindergarten, 
school, barracks, large hospital, club, gymnasium, and stadium. 
Add to this a superb garage and filling station and a powerful 
boilerhouse and generator hall with two marine diesel generators 
each producing one megawatt, and you will have some idea of the 
site, whose existence used to be a strict military secret. 
  Its main asset is its unique 32-meter antenna. All around 
the world such giant installations can be counted on the fingers 
of one hand. This 1,000-tonne structure designed for space 
communications is one of the most precise and complex of modern 
instruments. It is around this antenna that the fuss has now 
developed. 
  Owing to the hasty Russian troop withdrawal from Latvia our 
country is nursing colossal losses. There are many 
installations on this Baltic republic's territory which cost 
astronomical amounts of money to build and are now having to be 
abandoned. In particular, Latvia has inherited 26 former 
military airfields with ideal concrete runways (four of them are 
the best in Europe) capable of handling all types of aircraft, 
including the heaviest transports. Latvia is simply unable to 
digest everything it has inherited. Real estate, even if left 
unmonitored for a short period of time, becomes easy prey for 
looters. There are now whole gangs of them in the republic who 
rob abandoned military installations. For instance, immediately 
after one flying unit was withdrawn and redeployed to the east, 
the robbers descended on the deserted airfield. When, a couple 
of days later, representatives of the local authorities arrived 
here, they saw a picture that is now typical of Latvia -- stores 
were opened and sealed premises broken into. The raiders took 
everything they could find, including doors and window frames. 
  Obviously, the same fate would be in store for the Ventspils 
installation. But, fortunately for it, events have begun to 
develop to quite a different scenario. 
  When equipment was removed and the question of dismantling 
the antenna arose, the military consulted its developer -- 
Professor Boris Alekseyevich Poperechenko, chief designer at the 
Moscow Power Institute. He flew in and satisfied himself that 
dismantling the dish would be impossible. Did that mean it had 
to be blown up? No, the chief designer could not tolerate the 
idea of destroying his brainchild, which was the embodiment of 
state-of-the-art Russian technology. He suggested a different 
option. 
  That was how the news of this unique installation reached 
the Russian Academy of Sciences. And the leaders of the Applied 
Astronomy Institute proposed using it for absolutely peaceful 
purposes. 
  The fact is that this antenna is a superb radio telescope. 
The Russian Academy of Sciences' scientific organizations had 
never dreamed of such modern equipment. The largest telescope 
our radio astronomers have available to them is the 22-meter 
dish in Serpukhov. Consequently, when they need to do serious 
space research, they are forced to appeal to the military and to 
lease free time on their dishes. Understandably, in this 
situation you can only ever do one-time experiments, rather than 
systematic observations. 
  There was one other reason why it was important for the 
Russian Academy of Sciences to get its hands on the Ventspils 
installation. For eight years now the Applied Astronomy 
Institute has been implementing under a government decree the 
"Quasar" project -- a national Russian system of radio 
interferometers to be based on six 32-meter dishes located over 
a huge area from Leningrad Oblast to Kamchatka and from Murmansk 
to the North Caucasus. The greater the distance between the 
dishes, the more accurately the coordinates of stars and quasars 
can be determined and the more reliable the research results 
will be. 
  Project "Quasar" will also make it possible to resolve 
purely 
applied tasks connected with precision cartography, geodesy, the 
study of the country's natural resources, and so forth. But the 
construction of each of its six centers will require billions in 
expenditure and take a long time -- building a counterpart of 
the Ventspils dish will take up to 10 years. That is why the 
scientists are so interested in using it for the needs of 
fundamental and applied science. 
  This sensible and noble idea has met with a response from 
virtually everyone. After visiting Riga in late April a 
government delegation from Moscow signed a protocol envisaging 
joint work between scientists from the two academies of 
sciences, and a fundamental decision was reached to set up a 
Latvian-Russian radio astronmy center. It only remains to sign 
the already prepared draft intergovernmental agreement, but.... 
  "Initially we could not understand what was going on in 
Latvia," Andrey Finkelshteyn, deputy leader of the Russian 
Government delegation and director of the Applied Astronomy 
Institute, said. "All the necessary permits and signatures had 
seemingly been collected, the idea had been approved in 
government circles, and -- nothing happened. Then we realized 
that the Latvian Government is in a more difficult position than 
our own: Every step it takes is monitored by the opposition, if 
it took one step out of line it would be destroyed. 
Consequently, the republic's leaders are afraid that during the 
debate in the Saeima somebody will state that it is not Russian 
scientists who want to come to the Ventspils site, but disguised 
intelligence operatives; that the government has struck a deal 
with the Moscow generals.... And another scandal would break. 
  It was in order to calm things down and reassure the Latvian 
public that such fears are groundless, that the sensational 
"open-door" event was held near Ventspils Monday.

  [Text] Tallinn, June 04, BNS -- Major General Aleksander 
Einseln, the commander-in-chief of the Estonian Defense Forces, 
stated at a press conference Saturday that all details 
pertaining to Estonian-Israeli relations must be made known to 
the public. 
  "The arms deal with Israel is like an ulcer in today's 
Estonia that threatens to poison the whole organism. Everything 
connected with the TAAS Israel Industries Ltd. has given rise 
to mistrust and intrigues. The only way to get rid of the 
abscess is to cut it open," the general said. 
  The Estonian Government concluded the controversial arms 
deal 
with TAAS in January 1993 and the parliament ratified it behind 
closed doors in December. The price of the weapons Estonia 
bought, over 49 million U.S. dollars, is to be paid in two 
parts by Feb. 1, 2000. 
  Einseln said if all particulars of the deal were made public 
there'd be "no room for reciprocal accusations and allegations 
of dishonesty and corruption." 
  "Estonian people's money has been used to buy the weapons 
and 
the government has the obligation to prove that it was done 
honestly and legally. The people have the right to demand an 
explanation," the general maintained. 
  In his opinion, an independent commission to look into the 
deal should be set up and all its findings made public. 
  Einseln asked President Lennart Meri on May 31 to accept his 
resignation. One of the reasons behind his decision, he said, 
is that Prime Minister Mart Laar didn't tell him about plans for 
cooperation with Israel in the defense sphere. 
  Einseln found out May 16 that an Estonian-Israeli working 
group had been set up to deal with, among other issues, national 
defense problems. 
  "Laar didn't reply to my inquiries, but produced halftruths 
or lies. By now it's become clear that also Ants Laaneots, the 
former chief of Defense Forces general staff, concealed 
information from me," Einseln told BNS. 
  Laar had in February a meeting with a group of Israeli 
officials led by General Dan Shomron at which Estonia's security 
and defense concept and prospects for defense cooperation 
between the two countries were discussed. Also, a joint working 
group was then set up. 
  The government press service, however, denied Einseln's 
accusations and maintained that neither the government nor 
ministries had signed any pacts or agreements without informing 
the Defense Forces general staff. 
  "Information is not kept secret in a democratic state. I 
didn't know until recently that I was being lied to and that 
information was purposely withheld from me. I don't get mixed 
up in dirty business like politics, so it's all the same to me 
who's the prime minister or who's the defense minister. I do my 
duty and deal with the Estonian Defense Forces," the general 
told reporters. 
  Einseln also said he was surprised at the role Leonid 
Apananski, a private person, has played in Estonian-Israeli 
relations. 
  "It's absurd that Apananski the private person should be 
empowered by the Foreign Ministry to handle questions of 
national defense and I know nothing about it," he said. 
  The defense forces commander declared he was disappointed 
with Estonian reporters, since they'd failed to bring to light 
the behind-the-scenes workings of Estonian-Israeli relations. 
  "In a democratic state it's the journalists who uncover such 
things," he said. "I hope you'll do your job better in the 
future and bring such deals to light."

  [Text] Tallinn, Jun 06, BNS -- Major General Aleksander 
Einseln, the commander-in-chief of the Estonian Defense Forces, 
told reporters on Saturday that there was no way Raul Opik, one 
of the candidates for the defense vacancy, could return to the 
army. 
  Einseln discharged Opik the same day the general staff 
officer gave his consent to being nominated for the ministerial 
post. 
  "Since he got mixed up with politics, that's where he's 
going 
to remain," Einseln told reporters. "Military men have no place 
in politics, nor politicians in the defense forces." 
  Opik as a candidate for defense minister has already faced 
several parliamentary factions. While some political forces 
have remained neutral, others, like some members of the Estonian 
National Independence Party [ENIP] and the Liberals factions, 
are opposed to him. There is a rumor that, because of 
opposition from the ENIP, the premier has considered other 
possibilities. The name of Juri Valge, an advisor to the 
defense forces commander, has been mentioned in this context. 
  Prime Minister Mart Laar hasn't so far submitted any names 
for the president's approval. 
  Opik, who served on the general staff of the Estonian 
Defense 
Forces, has graduated from Tartu University in biology and 
taught his subject at several schools in Tallinn. In November 
1993 he completed a course for U.N. peacekeeping forces' staff 
officers in Sweden. He has done a stint in peacekeeping in 
Croatia. 
  Several general staff officers predicted that Opik would 
have 
a brilliant military career in the Baltic peacekeeping battalion 
under formation.

<F P=106> ["News Release"] </F>
  [Text] Estonian delegation at Estonian-European Union free 
trade negotiations, after returning from Brussels, gave a news 
conference saying progress had been made while several issues 
remained to be discussed further. 
  Latvia has closed the negotiations and is ready to initial 
the agreement, the head of the Estonian delegation, Priit 
Kolbre, said. 
  The main problems between Estonia and EU are in the field of 
textiles, Signe Ratso from the Estonian Economics Ministry said. 
Estonia is opposed to the double check system EU requests which 
would mean that Estonia should impose administrative control 
over all textile products moving to European markets. That 
contradicts Estonia's economics policy and understanding of free 
trade, Ratso added. Besides, imposing such mechanisms and 
issuing licenses is very costly. At the moment, Estonia enjoys 
tariff- and quota-free access to European markets, Priit Pallum 
from the Economics Ministry remarked. 
  Another field under negotiations were fishery, customs and 
agriculture. 
  Estonia is satisfied with the results achieved in the 
fishery 
group and, hopefully, EU member countries will accept the 
quotas, Lauri Vaarja, head of the Estonian Fishery Board, said. 
  The negotiation on agricultural produce must also continue 
as 
Estonia views conditions included in the protocol on market 
protection system unfavourable, deputy chancellor of the 
Ministry of Agriculture, Ruve Shank, said. Shank also said 
Estonia opposed the so-called joint Baltic quota proposed by the 
EU which would mean that the country which is the first to bring 
its check-up systems to European level would benefit most of the 
quotas. 
  Estonian-EU free trade agreement is expected to be 
initialled 
in the beginning of July and signed in October or November. In 
that case it can take effect on January 1, 1995 as planned.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jun 06, BNS -- Lithuanian President 
Algirdas Brazauskas on Monday signed the recently adopted law on 
government, which comes into effect next week. 
  In his traditional Monday radio interview this week, 
Brazauskas said outlays on government will not increase, 
although the number of ministries will grow from 16 to 19. 
  The president said changes within the Cabinet do not mean 
that a government of experts will be replaced by government of 
politicians. Brazauskas emphasized that ministers must be both 
politicians and experts. 
  Commenting on the creation of the new Environment Protection 
Ministry instead of the currently existing department, which is 
subordinate to the parliament, Brazauskas said it is not normal 
that an institution of the executive branch belongs to the 
legislative branch. Besides, he said, such ministries exist in 
nearly all countries around the Baltic Sea. Similar structures 
should deal with such problems as pollution of the sea, 
Brazauskas said. 
  Discussing division of the Culture and Education Ministry 
into two separate ministries, the president said these 
institutions were merged artificially and the step proved to be 
incorrect. 
  In Brazauskas' words, the new Municipal Affairs Ministry 
will 
not be very big, but is needed to carry out government reforms 
"from the top to the bottom."

  [Text] Last May, the rate of inflation stood at 6.2 percent 
in Lithuania. Director-General of the Lithuanian government's 
Statistics Department Kestutis Zaborskas told INTERFAX that the 
rate of inflation, registered last May, was the highest this 
year. However, it was lower than some local economists and 
manufacturers predicted (20-30 percent). 
  Zaborskas believes that the main cause of the inflation jump 
was the introduction of the 18 percent VAT [value added tax] 
which replaced the 18 percent general excise levied on a 
narrower range of goods and services, and which did not apply to 
imports. 
  Alcoholic drinks and tobacco became 11.4 percent more 
expensive - the highest increase registered last May. Prices on 
food went up by 5.5 percent, clothes and footwear by 4.5 
percent, rent and electric energy by 7.1 percent, transportation 
and communication by 8.2 percent and other goods and services by 
8 percent. 
  In April, the rate of inflation stood at 1.6 percent. 
Zaborskas said that in June it will not exceed 3-4 percent. 
  In Latvia, the rate of inflation was 2.7 percent last April 
and in Estonia - 3.1 percent.

<F P=106> [Nikolay Lashkevich report: "Socialists Paying Less Than </F>
Capitalists"] 
  [Text] Vilnius -- An analysis of statistics on the social 
situation of the inhabitants of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia 
published in the Lithuanian press shows that the worst Baltic 
country to live in is Lithuania and the best is Latvia. 
  The highest minimum wage -- 15 lats or over $26 -- was 
recorded in Latvia. Estonia is next with 300 kroon or over $22, 
and Lithuania is in last place with a mere 50 litai or over $12. 
The differences in average wage in the Baltic countries are 
less pronounced: Latvia leads with over 70 lats or almost $123, 
while the figures for Lithuania and Estonia are respectively 
almost 347 litai or over $88 and 1,165 kroon or almost $86. The 
average pension in Lithuania and Estonia is also virtually half 
that in Latvia. 
  Thus the difference in wages and pensions is still 
considerable and in the coming months this gap in living 
standards could increase even further, because since Lithuania 
introduced a tax innovation -- 18-percent value-added tax -- 
prices of essentials have rocketed. 
  The conclusion for the Lithuanian authorities is a very sad 
one: The market socialism with strong social support constantly 
proclaimed by the ruling party of Algirdas Brazauskas (this 
program helped it to win the elections) has proved to be no more 
than a slogan. Reality tells a different story: The living 
standard lags behind that of the neighboring Baltic republics, 
where power is not in the hands of socialists who are accustomed 
to thinking of themselves as champions of social justice.

  He also announced that Chisinau would advance a number of 
new 
demands, including the demand that Russia pay Moldova a 
compensation for the 14th Army's stay from the moment it was put 
under Russia's jurisdiction. 
  The talks will also deal with the military transit through 
Ukraine during the withdrawal. Talks will be started with 
Ukraine as the third party concerned. 
  In addition to the main agreement, seven or eight additional 
agreements are expected to be signed.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 4/6/1994 -- "Some aspects of 
the declaration of Moldovan President Mircea Snegur and Tiraspol 
leader Igor Smirnov signed on 28 April contradict the basic 
principles of the opinion poll "La Sfat Cu Poporul" ("Consulting 
With the People") especially the article which affirms that 
Moldova is a unitary state," states an analytic report of the 
Moldovan Euro-Atlantic Center. The authors of the report 
consider that the term "juridical status of state for Dniester," 
can be interpreted as "the creation of a confederation union on 
the basis of an agreement between two autonomous entities with 
equal rights for sovereignty." References of the type 
"departing from the existing political reality," which are often 
used in the declaration, could serve as a definite juridical 
basis for the legalization of the illegitimate structures of 
Dniester, including the armed forces, says the report. The 
experts of the Euro-Atlantic Center consider that the 28 April 
declaration allows the leaders of the self-proclaimed Dniester 
republic to negotiate about the interests of Tiraspol without 
having to give up any positions. At the same time the authors 
of the report doubt the legitimacy of the signing of the 
declaration on the behalf of Dniester by the Russian citizen 
Igor Smirnov. According to the cited source, the definite 
refusal of Chisinau to allow the representatives of Romania and 
the Ukraine to participate in the solving of the Dniester 
conflict may lead to an aggravation in the relations between 
Moldova and these states. The experts of the Euro-Atlantic 
Center gauged the results of the 28 April negotiations as a 
voluntary passage of Moldova into the Russian area of interests, 
which could generate essential problems in its relations with 
the West, including economic ones.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 4/6/1994 -- Of some 16,202 
offences which have been registered in the five months of 1994, 
20 percent were serious crimes, stated today on the Moldovan 
radio Victor Catana, prime vice minister of interior. The 
number of crimes against individuals decreased; murders and 
attempted murder fell by 3.2 percent in comparison with 1993. 
According to him, the police has solved 41.1 percent of the 
total number of crimes; 64.1 percent of all offences inflicting 
serious injuries and 65.9 percent of rapes and attempted rape 
cases were solved. Catana specified that 27 percent of the 
offences were committed by workers, 5 percent by peasants and 68 
percent by other social categories. He expressed concern about 
the amount of crimes committed by jobless people and youngsters 
who do not study. The number of crimes committed by drunk 
people increased by 40.8 percent, people with penal records by 
39.7 percent, groups by 19.2 percent, minors by 36.3 percent 
and people who do not work or study by 27.7 percent, said Victor 
Catana.

<F P=106> ["Statement" by the Ministry of Culture and Publishing] </F>
  [Text] On 1 June 1994, NARODNAYA GAZETA published the 
"Statement of the Belarusian Popular Front [BNF] Opposition in 
the Supreme Soviet," which contains accusations against the 
Ministry of Culture and Publishing of the Republic of Belarus. 
In connection with this, we believe it necessary to provide the 
citizens with objective information about the questions under 
discussion. 
  In its everyday activity, the Ministry of Culture and 
Publishing is guided by the Belarusian Constitution as well as 
other legislative and normative acts which safeguard state 
guarantees of the freedom of expression and publishing; the 
Ministry aims to create favorable conditions for real economic 
and creative independence of periodical publications and normal 
functioning of the entire system of national press. 
  With regard to the annulment of the registration 
certificates 
of NAVINY BELARUSKAHA NARODNAHA FRONTU "ADRADZHENNE" [BNF News 
"Revival"] and VYBAR [Choice] (Vitebsk), the resolution on this 
was adopted in accordance with the law on publishing and other 
information media. The Article 13 of this law provides: If a 
publication is not issued or published during over a year, its 
renewal requires a new registration certificate. The last issue 
of NAVINY BELARUSKAHA NARODNAHA FRONTU "REVIVAL" is dated 26 
March -- 20 April 1993. On 28 February 1994, the founder of the 
newspaper, Zyanon Paznyak, was asked in a letter to send to the 
ministry all issues of the newspaper, which were published 
following 20 April 1993. The ministry has received no answer to 
this letter. As a consequence, an annulment of the registration 
certificate was signed (22.04.94). 
  The newspaper VYBAR halted publication due to the fact that 
its founder -- the Vitebsk City Club "For Democratic Elections" 
-- has been denied registration by the Vitebsk Executive 
Committee of people's deputies. In short, the newspaper has 
lost its founder. 
  Since the statement of the BNF opposition deputies mentions 
the newspaper SVABODA, it is worth noting that the Ministry of 
Culture and Publishing has sent notices about violations of the 
law on publishing and other information media to the SVABODA 
founder and editorial staff, too. Unfortunately, the provisions 
contained in legislation has been ignored by them in many cases. 
SVABODA has often published materials that came into conflict 
with Article 5 of the law on publishing and other information 
media, thus becoming a subject of consideration by people's 
courts. 
  The Ministry of Culture and Publishing thinks that the BNF 
opposition's statement concerning the competence of the 
Ministry, is unsubstantiated and does not correspond to reality. 
In our opinion, this statement appeared due to profit-seeking 
reasons -- a striving for acquiring political capital during the 
last stage of the presidential elections in Belarus.

  [Text] Belarusian rayon and oblast newspapers whose 
publication is funded by the state budget have been issued the 
following directive from the Cabinet of Ministers: 
  "In connection with the holding of presidential elections 
and 
their objective coverage by information media, please be advised 
to safeguard the publication of BELINFORM reports in the local 
press." 
  The directive was signed by Deputy Prime Minister Demchuk. 
BELINFORM is an official state-budget information agency 
transformed from the former BELTA (Belarusian branch of TASS) 
which was closely controlled by the Central Committee of the 
Communist Party of Belarus, in which Demchuk was an instructor.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich described the 
refusal of the National Bank to grant a credit for the 
government to buy animal food as treason. 
  He told a rally of agriculture workers in the Nesvizh 
District, Minsk Region, that the bank was politically rather 
than economically motivated. Still, he said that the government 
would manage to help the country's agriculture. IF Note: 
Stanislav Bogdankevich, National Bank of Belarus chairman, 
disagreed with the recent agreement on the merger of the Russian 
and Belarusian monetary system, which, he said, curbed the 
bank's rights and threatened its independent existence. Nor 
does Bogdankevich support the Kebich government policy of 
granting large credits to the agriculture. 
  In Kebich's words, the government used three quarters of all 
centralized credits to support the agriculture in 1994. The 
budget allocation to the agriculture amounted to 3380 billion 
rubles, or over a quarter of all the expenditure. Over one 
trillion rubles were invested in the sowing campaign which was 
therefore a success. 
  Kebich also said that the government intended to compensate 
the deposits in saving banks. If he is elected president, the 
deposits which had been made worthless by inflation will be 
fully restored to the working people, he said. He added that 
his government had made a decision to compensate 60 percent of 
the deposits' worth. 
  Kebich believed that the village had to run the reform 
itself 
by combining various kinds of ownership. As president he would 
keep productive farms alive and enable the peasants to dispose 
of their products as best as they could, once the taxes were 
paid and the state contracts honored. 
  In his view, only the land and the property had to be taxed 
in agriculture. 
  Experts believe that these promises and proposals are part 
of 
his electoral campaign. 
  In an exclusive INTERFAX interview he had earlier called for 
having two state languages in his country, Belarussian and 
Russian. He thought that this issue had to be decided in a 
referendum. IF Note: Under the Belarussian Constitution 
Belarussian is the state language, Russian being a tool of 
inter-ethnic communication. 
  Kebich wanted the term "ethnic minorities" out of the 
official language. He said that the Belarussian people did not 
have to be divided into minorities and majorities. 
  He said that the country had been stable because its leader 
had been nipping all manifestations of nationalism in the bud. 
  Observers believe that equality of the Russian and 
Belarussian languages is as important in Kebich's program as 
monetary union with Russia and eventual integration of Belarus, 
Russia, and Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Tatyana Korupayeva report: "At Mention of Words `Hard </F>
Currency' People Keep Quiet"] 
  [Excerpts] People are thieving again in Russia.... They 
are swiping everything that comes to hand, everything to which 
the people have access, be it nails or gold bullion. But, as 
emerged at a briefing at the Russian Ministry of Internal 
Affairs [MVD] yesterday, people are most often put away for 
trifling matters as they are easier to investigate. Whereas the 
battle against "criminal infringements on hard currency assets," 
that is, against the plunder of the country's gold reserves, is 
very problematic. [passage omitted] 
  According to Russian Federation MVD statistics, six times 
more gold is being diverted today (than in 1984). The situation 
is the same with regard to other precious metals and stones 
(mostly industrial diamonds). 
  Inflation in Russia has forced citizens to think about the 
future -- should they invest their assets in freely convertible 
currency or get hold of it by any available means irrespective 
of how the Criminal Code regards them. For example, many people 
are today convinced that Article 88 of the Russian Federation 
Criminal Code has actually been repealed. No, dear fellow 
countrymen, it is alive and kicking, only they have stopped 
"putting people up against the wall" for illegal currency 
trafficking, and, what is more, nobody really knows what is 
legal and what is not today. If somebody buys $100 at the 
exchange rate from his neighbor, this remains legal until 
law-enforcement agency staffers collar him. If you have done 
this on the quiet, then well done. But in general it is 
forbidden by law to buy up hard currency from individuals. For 
example, there are some 15,000 bureaus de change in Moscow for 
this purpose, of which one-third, as a check showed, were set up 
independently, illegally, and have no license from the Central 
Bank of Russia or its representatives. 
  In 1993 alone 70 percent of crimes in Moscow were connected 
with foreign currency, which, as a rule, was unrecorded. It is 
used for bribes and to pay off extortionists, and a few Russian 
citizens are setting up numbered dollar accounts in Western 
banks with it. The U.S. Congress has already discussed the 
question of $40 billion being siphoned into West European banks 
from Russia. They are very concerned about this matter there. 
In Russia people are also concerned and perplexed, but at the 
moment no one is in a position to even halt this currency crime 
wave. Incredible efforts by law-enforcement agencies have 
managed to return only one-fifth of what is circulating outside 
the homeland to its coffers. 
  Predictions made by MVD staffers are very alarming: In the 
next three or four years there will be a repartition of spheres 
of influence among criminal structures in the gold- and 
diamond-extracting industry.

"`Vympel' Stays at the MVD"] 
  [Text] The rumors that have appeared that "Vympel" is 
returning to the FCS [Federal Counterintelligence Service] have 
been greatly exaggerated. There has been no talk of this, and 
nobody has even had such a thought, so the press services of the 
MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] and the FCS have declared. 
Moreover, "Vympel" does not exist as such. Following the 
special group's transfer to the MVD, the "Vega" special subunit 
was created on its basis. 
  Work is now being conducted within the FCS itself to create 
its own operational administration. The FCS Press Service does 
not possess any more detailed information at present.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel Boris Bolshakov, deputy head of the </F>
Federal Counterintelligence Service Personnel Directorate, by 
Aleksandr Dolinin; date, place not given: "Will You Join 
Counterintelligence?" -- first paragraph is introduction] 
  [Text] The Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS] was 
set up recently as an autonomous organization. Our 
correspondent spoke to Colonel Boris Bolshakov, deputy head of 
the Personnel Directorate, about the specific nature of the FCS 
and its problems. 
  [Dolinin] Boris Terentyevich, how is reform of your service 
going and has its cadre potential been preserved? 
  [Bolshakov] The FCS is not living in a vacuum, it is 
experiencing the effect of social development trends. There 
have been fundamental structural changes in the course of 
reorganization but no dramatic replacement of cadres; the 
professionals have been retained. We are improving management 
organization, we are being relieved of functions that do not 
properly belong to us and duplication of functions and are 
seeking out internal reserves. We are trying to preserve the 
best traditions in line with the Constitution and the laws. 
  [Dolinin] How far have your organization's functions 
changed? Who works in the FCS today? 
  [Bolshakov] The Border Troops have been assigned to an 
autonomous structure, investigation subunits have been wound up, 
and we have also been relieved of a number of functions 
belonging to internal affairs organs, and there have been 
considerable cuts in managerial structures. But in connection 
with growing international exchange, there is more work in 
ensuring economic security and preventing terrorism, sabotage, 
smuggling operations, and the narcotics business. We have 
embarked in earnest on improving information and analysis 
activity. Consequently, there can be no talk of a sizable cut 
in operational personnel. People who have completed their 
prescribed period of service have been discharged. We have no 
qualms about their future -- former counterintelligence 
personnel are rated highly on the job market. 
  The counterintelligence service has 75,000 personnel today, 
while the management apparatus numbers around 1,500. Forces and 
funds will continue to be redeployed. For instance, the cuts in 
the Armed Forces make it necessary to reorganize military 
counterintelligence organs. 
  Our operational personnel have higher education and most 
receive thorough special training. Many speak foreign 
languages. Rigorous selection and training are carried out at 
FCS training establishments and individual training is provided 
on the job. 
  [Dolinin] How does one get to serve in counterintelligence? 
  [Bolshakov] You will not find advertisements on the street 
or in the newspapers regarding employment in counterintelligence 
organs. Young people (Russian citizens) may be advised to apply 
to territorial counterintelligence organs. Personal voluntary 
recruitment can be as a servicemen or as a civilian. A contract 
is concluded with the former. Candidates are carefully vetted 
regarding their suitability for specific counterintelligence 
work. Morals, honesty, decency, and ability to resist negative 
influences go without saying. Health and physical fitness 
requirements are also high. 
  [Dolinin] Are women employed in counterintelligence? 
  [Bolshakov] We have plenty of women working for us, 
including officers and warrant officers. The range of these 
posts will clearly expand. 
  [Dolinin] You mentioned incentives for cadres... 
  [Bolshakov] The work of personnel in the most "challenging" 
areas attracts additional recognition; an "Honored 
Counterintelligence Officer" badge has recently been introduced. 
The officers who caught representatives of the British and 
German special services red-handed and who stopped an attempt by 
North Korean Embassy staffers to illegally buy state-of-the-art 
Russian technologies were the first to receive it. 
  [Dolinin] Has the FCS become more open? 
  [Bolshakov] Counterintelligence leaders have begun to speak 
out in the mass media more frequently. I consider it useful to 
issue official reports on collegium sessions and FCS leadership 
conferences. We give taxpayers information about the way their 
money is spent. Studying public opinion helps make the 
necessary adjustments to our work. 
  There are also plenty of fabrications about our work which 
give rise to various rumors, conjecture, and suspicions 
regarding counterintelligence. People try to blame it for 
things that it has nothing to do with. 
  How can disinformation be countered? For instance, on the 
initiative of the FCS director the stamp "For Official Use Only" 
was removed from the document announcing the statute on our 
service. It has been published in the open press. 
  [Dolinin] Boris Terentyevich, what is your service's 
attitude to KRASNAYA ZVEZDA? 
  [Bolshakov] We consider your newspaper to be our own. Most 
of our personnel subscribe to it. I would like us to have 
regular businesslike ties.

Ruslan Khasbulatov and three opposition leaders: Doku Zavgayev, 
Chechen-Ingushetia's last Communist Party leader; Yaragi 
Mamodayev, head of the so-called government of popular trust, as 
well as Abdulla Bugayev, leader of Freedom political movement, 
and Salambek (Gadzhiyev), who are the most active opposition 
leaders. Official Groznyy accuses them of collusion with Russia 
and actions against the Chechen people. Also today, the Chechen 
Foreign Ministry called upon all foreign states to refrain from 
any contacts with the opposition.

  [Text] The head of the Russian presidential administration 
Sergey Filatov has accused the Chechen President Dzhokar Dudayev 
of foiling the talks between Moscow and Groznyy. In a Monday 
interview with Interfax he said that the latest statement by 
Dudayev actually undermined the budding talks between Chechnya 
and the federal government bodies. 
  On Sunday in an interview televised by NTV, Dudayev, who 
seemed very irritated, once again accused Russia of fanning 
tension around his republic and threatened to apply adequate 
measures to Russia. 
  At a meeting with the press, Filatov said it was most 
strange 
that Groznyy actually refuses to continue the dialogue because 
he claimed it was the Chechen leadership that came with the 
initiative of the meeting between presidents Boris Yeltsin and 
Dzhokar Dudayev. 
  Filatov regretted that instead of a policy of negotiations 
Dudayev chose the policy of seeking enemies. 
  He described as a dirty game the attempt of the Chechen 
leader to label the decree of the Russian president on the 
expansion of the zone of the state of emergency in North Ossetia 
and Ingushetia as the occupation of Chechen territory by Russia. 
He said the spreading of the state of emergency regulations to 
Malgobek and Sunzhen regions of Ingushetia neighboring on 
Chechnya was agreed upon by Yeltsin and the Ingush President 
Ruslan Aushev and directed at strengthening stability and peace 
in the region. 
  Filatov recognized that Dudayev is the actual Chechen leader 
who cannot be disregarded but said that a threat to Russian 
society comes from that area. He said arms are smuggled from 
Chechnya to Russia, trains are robbed, other crimes committed. 
  "In any case Russia has two problems to resolve in Chechnya: 
socio-economic and fiscal, it has to protect Russian citizens 
there", Filatov said. He stressed that if passengers and cargos 
crossing Chechnya by rail are not protected, Russia might face 
the necessity of altering the railway route. 
  Filatov said that despite the failure of the talks with 
Groznyy Moscow will try to analyze the reasons and define the 
way of normalizing relations. 
  The sharp anti-Russian statements on the part of Chechen 
President Dzhokar Dudayev make it impossible that Moscow appoint 
representatives for the talks on settlement of relations between 
the Russian federal bodies and Groznyy, Kremlin Chief of Staff 
Sergey Filatov told Interfax today. He stressed that the 
president had earlier wanted new Minister for Nationalities and 
Regional Policies Nikolay Yegorov to be the Russian chief 
negotiator at the talks with Chechnya.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovsky; edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Sergey Shakhray, who is 
responsible in the Russian government for ethnic policies, has 
granted an exclusive interview to the Interfax correspondent 
Vitaliy Djibuti. 
  IF: The media carry much information about the possible 
settlement of relationships between Russia and Chechnya. Some 
Chechen politicians even began to flare up passions speaking 
about the possible "local nuclear explosion" in Chechnya, 
allegedly organized by the Russian side. What is behind the 
incessant political interest and the hysteria of the "official 
Grozny" in connection of the current bilateral talks? 
  SHAKHRAY: There are at least three reasons. The first 
reason is in the political course of the official Chechen 
leadership aimed at the republic's economic self-isolation. The 
result is that today all political forces in the republic are 
facing the need to find prompt solutions to pull the republic 
out of the economic crisis. The second reason is the 
uncontrolled growth of crime and the danger to people's 
security. The third reason is in the growing political 
competition inside the republic among several political figures. 
  Also troublesome is the threat of smuggling fire arms and 
drugs and uncontrolled duty-free cargo transportation. The 
growing crime in the Chechen republic prevents from the safety 
of cargoes which pass along the republic. This forces the 
Russian Government to think about the construction of a 
68-kilometer railway section which will go round the Chechen 
republic. 
  The destruction of "fuel arteries", the violation of 
activities of the republic's oil-processing complex, the losses 
sustained by the republic's neighbors make the Russian 
government to boost the construction of an oil-processing 
factory in Daghestan. 
  In addition, numerous "shuttle" flights of the Chechen 
planes 
to Turkey, the Middle East and other regions, which are 
violating international safety flight norms have put under 
threat the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, who are 
forced to earn their living by going abroad and buying goods 
there to sell them in their country. 
  The Russian Federation receives notes of protest from 
foreign 
countries which say about the violation of the international 
norms of flight safety. 
  The unsettled economic contacts between Chechnya and the 
Russian Federation, without any artificial blockades and 
sanctions, lead to the economic self-isolation of the Chechen 
Republic. Representatives of the financial and industrial 
quarters of the Chechen Republic will hardly see what is going 
on without taking appropriate measures. This forces both sides 
to look for the way out of the deadlock. 
  IF: It was reported earlier that the Russian government is 
concerned over the situation in terms of pensions payment to the 
people living in the Chechen Republic. 
  SHAKHRAY: Unfortunately, the non-payment of pensions to the 
people who earned them by their hard work, is a common practice 
in the Chechen Republic. Given that the pensioners, the 
Chechens, the Russians, and Ingushis and other nationalities are 
not to blame for the non-payment, the Russian government decided 
to pay pensions to them. But there are no guarantees that 
common people will get them because the money may be plundered 
even before the distribution. 
  IF: Will the signing of a bilateral agreement between the 
Chechen Republic and the Russian Federation be interpreted as 
the refusal of Chechnya from its course for independence and 
sovereignty? 
  SHAKHRAY: Independence is to dispose freely and voluntarily 
of one's possibilities and resources. That is why the mutual 
delegation of powers is a practical form for the materialization 
of independence and sovereignty. And to settle economic 
problems and combat crime is the top priority issue. 
  IF: It seems that the lack of settlement of the Chechen 
issue is also due to the difference in the approaches to the 
political framing of Russian-Chechen relations displayed by 
certain Russian leaders. 
  SHAKHRAY: I do not understand from what angle this issue can 
be discussed. Politically, the issue has been solved. The 
president's message to the parliament clearly said that the 
talks could be based on free elections in Chechnya and 
negotiations on power-sharing with the federal bodies. The 
State Duma has stated an analogous position. The formula on 
free elections is not an ultimatum or a pre-condition. This is 
a question of legalization of the reached agreements and of the 
package of economic agreements with no preliminary specific term 
for the elections must be set. This is not at all a question of 
political situation or one's personal predilections. That is 
why today discussion between the federal powers on this subject 
will be out of place. 
  IF: How are the bilateral talks between the Russian and the 
Chechen power bodies going now? 
  SHAKHRAY: Currently, there are consultations in the Russian 
government. The ministries and departments concerned and the 
governmental commission which I head are working on economic and 
juridical matters related to all the issues. This must result 
in a draft bilateral treaty and a package of necessary economic 
agreements. 
  IF: Is it possible that President Yeltsin and President 
Dudayev will have a personal meeting within the scope of the 
talks? 
  SHAKHRAY: The Chechen president has repeatedly addressed the 
Russian president asking for a personal meeting and for 
discussion of the problems concerning settlement of the 
conflict. If properly prepared for, such a meeting can play an 
important role. 
  IF: Certain experts consider it quite possible that two well 
known Chechen politicians -- Dzhokhar Dudayev and Ruslan 
Khasbulatov will agree on division of "spheres of influence" in 
domestic political affairs. Will this have an impact on the 
position of the federal power towards Chechnya? 
  SHAKHRAY: It may happen that Ruslan Khasbulatov and Dzhokhar 
Dudayev agree on a formula in accordance with which Dudayev will 
sign an agreement with Russia and elections to the Federation 
Council will be held on its basis. In this case there would be 
no reasons for doubting Khasbulatov's victory. It can be 
prognosticated that then the interests of the two politicians 
will really be placed to different spheres. 
  [IF Note: The Chechen authorities deprived Russian Supreme 
Soviet ex-speaker Khasbulatov of the right for living on Chechen 
territory. The government, the parliament and the Security 
Council held a joint meeting on Sunday and decided to put an end 
to illegal activities of some Chechen opposition leaders by the 
same way. Among those accused of activities against the Chechen 
people and of a plot with Russian imperial forces, there were 
mentioned: Doku Zavgayev (the last Chechen-Ingush Communist 
leader currently living in Moscow) and Yaragi Mamadayev who 
leads the government of people's confidence which he had 
established himself.] 
  SHAKHRAY: One point is obvious -- only that Chechen 
politician will be capable of ensuring his political future and 
do good to his people, who will hold talks and normalize 
relations with Russia. 
  Specific names or family names do not matter. The reality is 
that innocent people, numerous refugees fled from their houses 
are suffering. Only gradual, careful and attentive work during 
negotiations will help to resolve this problem. 
  Consultations between the federal power and Chechen 
different 
political forces will help to consolidate the society within the 
Chechen Republic. All Chechen politicians will soon ascertain 
that the subject of the talks -- the economic issues and 
struggle with crime -- is important for different political 
groups. The main point is that they be guided just by one 
aspiration -- to do good to their people. That is why the role 
of Chechnya's neighbors, kind peace Caucasian traditions is of 
importance. Everyone will have some work to do. 
  We must try to compensate our lost urgently, to restore the 
broken relations, to bring people back to their houses and to 
halt growing crime.

  [Text] "The goals of the Accord for Russia movement -- the 
arrival to power of the opposition forces, the restoration of 
the Soviet Union, and economic and social order -- are 
compatible with the goals of the Agrarian Party, although our 
attitude to this movement is cautious, Chairman of the Agrarian 
Party Mikhail Lapshin told Interfax. He explained his position 
by the fact that the agrarians favored a broader coalition of 
opposition forces and by the fears lest agricultural workers 
might be used by one of this movement's wings to advance their 
own political interests. 
  The opposition forces cannot disregard the growing strength 
of the agrarian movement, he continued. The time has come when 
the left-wing forces must give their backing to agricultural 
workers, who are ready to act resolutely in accordance with the 
Constitution against the current regime, he said. 
  Lapshin signed the statement by the Accord for Russia 
movement's leaders, but did not attend the first session of its 
national council on May 28, saying that he was busy working in 
the State Duma.

  [Text] Moscow, June 6, IRNA -- Russian authorities have 
banned Moscow-based weekly AL-QUDS for alleged violation of 
Russian laws and printing of anti-Zionist articles. Officials 
cite anti-Jewish propaganda and anti-government stance of the 
weekly as reasons for its ban. 
  The weekly was viewed by political parties and people as a 
prestigious publication which criticized the government, 
revealed plots of Zionism and imperialism and published 
documents relating to the last year's government troop attack on 
parliament.

  [Text] A spokesman for the Bank of Russia says that the 
central bank intends to tighten its control of currency exchange 
points because many contraventions of banking legislation are 
taking place. Among other things, an upper limit will be imposed 
on cash sales of hard currency -- probably this summer. 
However, he added that this question must be agreed with the 
Government and the customs service.

  [Text] The draft law on Russia's 1994 budget will 
definitely be adopted in June, State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin 
told Interfax on Monday. As we reported earlier, the discussion 
of the draft budget had been scheduled for June 8. 
  To quote Rybkin, allocations will be increased by a total of 
8 trillion rubles on research, military-conversion projects, 
science, education, culture and social welfare. 
  Jointly with the government, the State Duma is looking for 
additional sources of revenues, including arms exports. 
  Commenting on the Federation Council's recommendations to 
increase military spending from 37 trillion to 55 trillion 
rubles, Rybkin said: "Dreaming is no sin." 
  Asked about the reason behind his meeting with Yeltsin 
scheduled for Tuesday, he said that it would be a routine 
meeting held monthly on the first Tuesday to discuss the most 
urgent issues.

<F P=106> [Irina Savvateyeva report: "Many Plants and Factories Could </F>
Be Sold Off and Their Leaders Fired"] 
  [Text] Boris Yeltsin has signed the edict "On the Sale of 
State Debtor-Enterprises." This is one of the most important 
documents in the recent package of economic edicts from the 
president. 
  A number of experts believe that the edict was not signed 
together with six previous edicts because of strong pressure 
from the directors' lobby because the document proposes a 
realistic mechanism for removing incompetent enterprise 
directors from their jobs. 
  But Sergey Belyayev, leader of the Federal Administration 
for 
Insolvency (Bankruptcy), claims that the delay in signing the 
edict was caused not by pressure from lobbyists, but by the need 
to finalize this legally important document. 
  Under the edict, insolvent state enterprises not covered by 
the statute on the procedure for granting state financial 
support are to be sold off. They will not be subject to other 
forms of reorganization and will be selected by the Federal 
Administration for Insolvency as suitable for selling off. 
  In an interview with IZVESTIYA, Sergey Belyayev reported 
that 
the sale of insolvent enterprises is designed to prevent the 
process of bankruptcy or the effective self-liquidation of 
certain production facilities. The term "sale of an enterprise" 
means the sale of its business and property, and a change in 
corporate ownership. 
  Essentially, selling off insolvent state enterprises is 
tantamount to privatizing them. But this will not be a 
traditional kind of privatization from below, through a 
flotation, but a denationalization as a result of the enterprise 
being bought by a new owner. 
  The sell-off process will automatically ensure a change in 
the managerial staff. And it is this more than anything that 
worries the traditional Soviet directors, who are strongly 
whipping up feelings in their labor collectives in connection 
with the adoption of the new edict. But if anyone will be 
unambiguously fired it will be the director himself. 
  After the Federal Administration decides that an insolvent 
enterprise is to be sold off, the contract with its leaders will 
be torn up. And a new administrator, who will work within the 
framework of the sell-off agreement until such time as the 
enterprise is bought up, will be appointed by the state to 
replace the former director. His powers will be strictly 
defined by the state, and he will have no opportunity to exploit 
state property, as happens under the conditions of full economic 
management [vedeniye]. 
  Enterprises will be sold by commercial tender. The main 
requirement of any purchaser will be to pay off the enterprise's 
debts. The nonpayment problem will thus be resolved. One other 
condition is the need to put in a certain minimum amount of 
investment. 
  Sergey Belyayev believes that there will be people in Russia 
willing to buy up insolvent enterprises on these terms. In the 
opinion of the leader of the Federal Administration, the 
opportunity to buy up such enterprises will not only be an 
incentive for the start of a new phase of privatization, but 
will also be an excellent antidote to the flight of Russian 
capital abroad. Incidentally, foreign investors will also be 
able to buy enterprises.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksey Portanskiy: "Kremlin Breakthrough in </F>
Export Policy Hard To Digest in Ministry Offices"] 
  [Text] The confused impressions of the revolutionary 
nature of the president's recently published economic edicts 
package are being replaced with a sober analysis of their 
practical points. In the opinion of Foreign Economic Relations 
Minister Oleg Davydov, the "revolutionary breakthrough" in his 
sphere could cause more headaches than tangible progress today. 
  Consistency and gradualness in the liberalization of 
Russia's 
foreign trade was defined in the Russian Federation Government's 
March memorandum on economic policy submitted to the IMF. To 
wit, as of 1 July it was planned to abolish quotas except for 
seven important items: oil, gas, electricity, diesel fuel, 
copper, aluminum, and nickel -- for these it was planned to 
retain quotas at least until the end of 1994. 
  This memorandum was approved by the government. The Ministry 
of Foreign Economic Relations followed the memorandum, Minister 
O. Davydov said. In his opinion we were obviously getting ahead 
of ourselves with the edict. Because from its more than terse 
text it could be understood that we have already carried out a 
virtually 100 percent liberalization of exports. But is that 
the case today? 
  A mechanism of currency control over exports, that is over 
the movement and receipt of profits, has not yet been created. 
And since that is so, arguments about the leakage of capital 
out of Russia will be justified. The Ministry of Foreign 
Economic Relations, the Russian Federation State Customs 
Committee, and the banks must work out this mechanism by the end 
of the year. 
  The application of quotas and licensing affect the export of 
energy carriers to the greatest extent. Quotas for gas can be 
repealed painlessly -- we have one monopolist, "Gazprom," in 
this field -- and the sale of gas is determined by the 
throughput capability of the gas pipeline and by demand. As for 
oil, Oleg Davydov believes that for the exporter the main thing 
has always been to be on schedule in pumping it through the oil 
pipeline. And whereas previously quotas were established in the 
government following the proposal of the Ministry of the Economy 
and the Ministry of Fuel and Energy, now the same quota 
allocation system will merely be moved to a greater extent into 
the pumping system. 
  In general, the state does not have the right to abandon the 
tool of licensing, the minister asserts. After all, there are 
licenses for military equipment, dual-application technology, 
and so forth. So, without giving a detailed explanation of where 
they remain and where they do not, one cannot speak of repealing 
them. Transforming the authorization system for issuing licenses 
into an application system -- that is, easing it -- is another 
matter, but here the mechanism must be retained -- that is the 
position of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. 
  The fact that exports must be expanded if there is no 
domestic demand is not doubted. That would be greatly promoted 
by a reduction of export duties, which are an anachronism. 
According to the above-mentioned memorandum, we undertook to 
reduce them by 38 percent in September. According to Davydov, 
this will provide a considerable incentive: The advantage to 
the producer will increase, many goods will become competitive, 
and our budget will grow more effectively from export profits. 
  Another anachronism of ours is the institution of special 
exports, created by the specific nature of our development. But 
now, with the repeal of quotas and licenses, special exports 
cannot be abolished, at least until the end of the year. 
Otherwise, it will be impossible to control export and 
correspondingly the receipt of profits from export. 
  The drafters of the president's edict had the correct 
strategic aim -- the liberalization of foreign trade -- but in 
this case they clearly leapfrogged natural and previously 
designated stages. That is the gist of the foreign economic 
relations ministers' comments. Nonetheless, the edict will be 
implemented by the usual means of supplementary documents. 
  Of course, what has been said does not do away with some 
questions. The edict was not prepared without the government's 
participation, and before it was sent for the president to sign 
Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin signed the document. So the very 
fact that it has been criticized by a minister is quite out of 
the ordinary. Let us also add that in the opinion of some 
independent experts the edict's criticism by the Ministry of 
Foreign Economic Relations can be explained -- the department is 
defending its own interests connected with the possibility of 
giving or failing to give permission for the export of raw 
materials.

<F P=106> [Aleksey Portanskiy report: "Your Authorization To Export </F>
Foreign Currency Could Be Forged"] 
  [Text] If you have decided to go on a foreign trip, taking 
with you a tidy sum in foreign currency so as not to stint 
yourself at all when abroad, there is no problem. You can now 
obtain authorization to export freely convertible currency 
without any particular difficulty right at the currency exchange 
facility. But prepare yourself not to faint from irritation at 
the airport if you are suddenly not allowed through the barrier: 
Your authorization could be forged. 
  "Based on the instances recorded by us, `forged document' 
criminal cases are being instituted virtually every other day," 
I was told by Yuriy Afonin, deputy chief of customs at 
Sheremetyevo-2. "We are seriously concerned by the massive 
number of fraudulent currency exchange facilities. A completely 
unsuspecting citizen goes there, buys foreign currency, and the 
authorization issued to him turns out to be invalid." 
  Hapless passengers are taking out forty, fifty, or sixty 
thousand dollars each under these false documents -- at 
Sheremetyevo customs alone these sums apparently run to at least 
$1 million. 
  On detecting a forgery the customs officers, as instructed, 
carry out the necessary investigation: They inspect the foreign 
currency, question the witnesses, including the foreign currency 
carrier, and pass the case over to the Air Transport 
Prosecutor's Office. Then the prosecutor's office conducts an 
investigation and establishes that the authorization is indeed 
forged; but it is not that the detained person made an honest 
mistake -- he was completely unaware of the possibility of any 
violation on his part. 
  Consequently the victim's money is returned to him. The 
elements of a crime are not present, because the law considers 
smuggling to be only that which is done with deliberate intent, 
that is, when a person was aware of everything and desired the 
consequences. In an attempt to get to the bottom of a forged 
authorization, the investigative organs make enquiries at the 
bank whose requisites appear on the document. But as a rule the 
latter replies that the authorization in question cannot be 
found in its records and consequently cannot have been issued. 
The circle is closed and the case ends. 
  But it is not only exchange facilities that provide 
authorizations. Certain citizens with no great respect for the 
law are not averse to acquiring the coveted chit from dubious 
types under the counter. 
  At the beginning of the year the Federal Service for Foreign 
Currency and Export Control checked out only one of the 
authorized commercial banks and discovered that tens of millions 
of dollars in foreign currency were actually being issued there 
without supporting documents. I was told by the aforementioned 
service that new checks of both currency exchange facilities and 
the banks themselves are scheduled for June. 
  From the viewpoint of the Federal Service for Foreign 
Currency Control, and especially of the customs service, a 
considerable share of the responsibility for violations of the 
foreign currency exchange procedure rests with the authorized 
banks. 
  The law-abiding citizen must have the unhindered opportunity 
to obtain authorization to export legally acquired foreign 
currency without the risk of being swindled. But now it is 
better to do this only in reputable exchange facilities which 
have a full list of the necessary documents and equipment.

<F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Mikhaylov, Russian minister of atomic </F>
energy, by Aleksandr Khokhlov; date and place of interview not 
stated: "Russia's Chief `Hawk': Bomb Is Useful in the Economy"] 
  [Text] Viktor Nikitovich Mikhaylov is the creator of 
Russia's third generation of nuclear weapons. He is 60 years 
old and was born in the countryside. He graduated from the 
Moscow physical engineering institute. He is a doctor of 
technical sciences, a professor, and the author of over 260 
scientific works and a winner of Lenin and state prizes. He is 
the founder of the scientific school for the physics of nuclear 
explosive fission and the diagnosis of single-pulse penetrating 
radiation processes. Since March 1992 he has been Russian 
Federation minister of atomic energy. He gave his recently 
published autobiography the title I Am a `Hawk.' 
  [Khokhlov] In recent years only lazy politicians, deputies, 
and journalists have failed to attack our nuclear scientists and 
defense industry officials. You actively favor the conservation 
and development of the military-industrial complex, nuclear 
power, and nuclear weapons. Does it not seem to you that today 
this is a voice crying in the desert? 
  [Mikhaylov] No. Today a change is taking place in Russians' 
public awareness. Finally it is becoming clear to the majority 
that in a changing world Russia can be preserved only as a state 
with progressive technologies, with a powerful industry and 
modern weapons. The majority of high technologies have been 
developed and continue to be developed at the scientific centers 
of the Ministry of Atomic Energy and the State Committee for the 
Defense Industry. Why kill the goose that lays the golden eggs? 
We have had enough "revolutions!" And it is very important 
today to preserve what has already been achieved -- in the 
economy and in the military sphere. 
  [Khokhlov] But should we continue to produce nuclear 
weapons, of which Russia already has enough to destroy the world 
several times over? 
  [Mikhaylov] No one intends to destroy it. On the contrary, 
by the year 2003 Russia's nuclear arsenal will have been reduced 
tenfold. We will have 3,500 nuclear warheads left -- highly 
effective warheads capable of defending the country reliably 
against any encroachments. 
  I have believed and continue to believe that nuclear weapons 
remain the only means of maintaining global stability on earth. 
Yes, there is an alternative -- complete trust in the world. 
But is that feasible now? I doubt it.... 
  The postwar world was held up on fear of the use of nuclear 
weapons. That is bad. But would it really have been better for 
World War III to break out? The USSR has now disintegrated, 
there is no longer a Warsaw Pact, the Berlin wall has been 
dismantled for souvenirs. Has the world become more peaceful? 
No, alas, it has not. Today the new military-political map of 
the 21st century world has started to take shape. Spheres of 
influence and the strategic interests of many states and 
military-political alliances are being reviewed. The terms 
"global country" and "regional country" are becoming commonplace 
in politics. I was born in a great country and I do not want to 
see my motherland a raw-material tributary in the next century. 
That is my "hawk's song." 
  [Khokhlov] Then you probably do not greatly welcome the 
Russian-U.S. accords on the broad-scale reduction of nuclear 
arsenals? 
  [Mikhaylov] We saw long ago that there are too many weapons. 
They must be reduced. But we must have a realistic approach 
toward the pace of disarmament. 
  The dismantling of one nuclear warhead costs $100,000. And 
no one abroad will help us here. They do not have the technical 
and financial potential, they do not have the technologies. And 
what politician will allow foreign warheads to be brought into 
his country and dismantled? 
  Today Russia is spending up to 1,000 billion rubles [R] a 
year on the dismantling of the nuclear warheads to be reduced. 
Developing the scale of this undoubtedly necessary business is 
an extremely difficult problem. We need investments, enormous 
investments. And there can be no talk here of any profits 
allegedly "extracted" by Russia. The agreement with the United 
States on the processing of weapons-grade uranium over the 
course of 20 years for use as fuel for nuclear electric power 
stations is only partial compensation for the expenses we have 
already incurred by destroying the warheads of Ukraine, 
Belorussia [Belarus], and Kazakhstan. As a whole, there is 
still food for thought for the politicians and economists of the 
whole world. 
  [Khokhlov] Previously everything connected with nuclear 
problems was strictly secret. Is the Ministry of Atomic 
Energy's "iron curtain" being opened today? 
  [Mikhaylov] We are simply doomed to cooperation with the 
scientists of other countries. Russia has actively joined in 
work to create international cooperation in the field of 
scientific research and the dissemination of new technologies. 
  We have also started to use foreign investments. A number of 
developments in the Ministry of Atomic Energy's scientific 
research institutes and enterprises are financed by foreigners, 
and the results are being used jointly. In 1993 we attracted 
about $80 million by this means for additional financing for 
scientific and technological developments. 
  [Khokhlov] Will this openness not lead to the leakage of 
secret information? 
  [Mikhaylov] We show only what we want to show. 
  [Khokhlov] And no one tries to "take a peek" at anything? 
Or to bribe our scientists going abroad? 
  [Mikhaylov] I am not involved with spies. But competent 
organs assure me that there are no spies in the Ministry of 
Atomic Energy system. With an increase in the exchange of 
specialists there has indeed been an increase in the relevant 
organizations' intelligence interest in them. But I think it is 
not yet known who can "spy" more on whom.... Indeed, it is not 
my sphere of activity. 
  [Khokhlov] Not so long ago there was a noisy story about the 
attempt by a group of our nuclear scientists to leave for North 
Korea.... 
  [Mikhaylov] They did not include a single nuclear scientist. 
Another case of misinformation. There is not a single nuclear 
physicist from the weapons complex who would flee or try to flee 
Russia. As far as I know, specialists in the development of 
carriers, that is rocket specialists, intended to go to North 
Korea. 
  [Khokhlov] The Americans have now "taken up" North Korea 
very seriously. In your view, is it a case here of politics or 
has the Asian state indeed become the possessor of nuclear 
weapons? 
  [Mikhaylov] The nonproliferation of nuclear weapons is a 
very sensitive question. A large group of states is seeking to 
create nuclear weapons or already has them. 
  One can say quite confidently that India has nuclear weapons 
-- it has carried out two warhead tests. The Republic of South 
Africa has admitted that it has "military atomic energy." 
Pakistan, Iraq, Israel, and a number of other countries deny 
they have such weapons but are actively involved in creating 
them. The technological and scientific potential of many states 
now enables them to design and produce primitive nuclear devices 
which could be used for military purposes. 
  [Khokhlov] What is "primitive" for you? For instance, the 
kind of devices which the United States used in 1945 to destroy 
Hiroshima and Nagasaki? 
  [Mikhaylov] Perhaps these devices are even simpler. As for 
North Korea, I doubt that it could create nuclear warheads in 
the very near future. Its scientific potential is not high and 
its technologies are far from progressive. Perhaps there is the 
accumulation of certain quantities of uranium. 
  [Khokhlov] Bought from us? 
  [Mikhaylov] Including some bought from us. But let us treat 
this as calmly as possible, without strewing our heads with 
ashes, as is customary now. For instance, we have sold nothing 
to Pakistan but that has not prevented it from developing its 
own military nuclear program. Incidentally, West European 
companies which sold dual-purpose technologies and output helped 
Iraq very considerably in its nuclear developments. I state 
absolutely categorically that among the developed states Russia 
has the smallest contribution to the proliferation of nuclear 
technologies across the planet. 
  [Khokhlov] Viktor Nikitovich, let us turn from the 
"military" atom to the "peaceful" atom. Although since 
Chernobyl that term sounds ambivalent.... 
  [Mikhaylov] New technologies always involve risk. The 
Chernobyl tragedy taught us a lot. Questions of the safe 
operation of nuclear electric power stations are a priority now. 
But however unpleasant it is to remember Chernobyl, the use of 
nuclear energy for peaceful creation is the natural path of 
mankind's progress. 
  The date of 27 June is the jubilee of nuclear power 
engineering. The world's first nuclear electric power station 
was commissioned 40 years ago in Obninsk. Today, 17 percent of 
electricity on the planet and 30 percent of electricity in 
Europe is generated at nuclear electric power stations. In our 
country the figure is 12 percent but in some countries it is up 
to 80 percent. Incidentally, the economic "miracles" of Japan, 
Germany, and South Korea are the direct consequence of those 
countries' use of the cheap energy from nuclear fission. 
Whether there will be a resurrection of Russia also depends to 
a considerable degree on our efforts today in the development of 
this type of energy. Nuclear energy is ecologically clean 
energy. There is no alternative. The combustion of large 
quantities of organic fuel leads to the emergence of the 
greenhouse effect and destroys the planet's ozone layer. 
  Rapidly developing mankind can retain a sensible compromise 
with the environment only if nuclear energy is developed. The 
main thing, of course, is to make it safe. 
  [Khokhlov] Is something being done? 
  [Mikhaylov] Russia is cooperating actively with the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The safety of 
nuclear electric power stations is a problem for all mankind and 
the developments of the scientists of any country should serve 
all people. 
  Most important in world cooperation has been work to 
increase 
the safety of existing first-generation Russian reactors. The 
United States, Britain, the FRG, and Japan are taking part in 
this work. A fundamentally new approach -- the "station" 
approach -- has been agreed for technical assistance to the 
safety of Russian nuclear electric power stations, whose 
implementation has been initiated within the framework of the 
European Union commission's budget. The "station" approach will 
be implemented directly at the Kalinin, Balakovo, Kola, 
Smolensk, Leningrad, and Beloyarsk nuclear electric power 
stations. 
  But we nonetheless regard our own developments are the 
priority ones. There are already plans for stations with their 
own natural safety. The products of fission at these stations 
in any unforeseen situations will be localized within the 
reactor block. An uncontrolled nuclear fission chain reaction is 
in principle impossible at nuclear electric power stations of 
the new generation. 
  [Khokhlov] Incidentally, about nuclear waste. Recently the 
"greens" have tried to prevent their import into Russia from 
Finland. Why should our country become the world's "nuclear 
garbage heap?" 
  [Mikhaylov] This is all idle talk: Russia is allegedly 
putting a time bomb under itself. The Soviet Union has 
constructed several nuclear electric power stations abroad and 
the waste at these stations can be stored for no more than five 
years. Under the terms of treaties with Bulgaria, Finland, 
Hungary, and the Czech Republic Russia, as the USSR's legal 
heir, is continuing to import it and process it at enterprises 
of the Ministry of Atomic Energy. 
  [Khokhlov] Where exactly? 
  [Mikhaylov] Where the fuel was produced -- near Krasnoyarsk, 
Tomsk, and Chelyabinsk. After special processing the nuclear 
electric power station waste is enclosed in glass and stored in 
concrete bunkers. That is absolutely safe for people and the 
environment. 
  [Khokhlov] A sudden earthquake? 
  [Mikhaylov] We do not expect earthquakes in the places where 
nuclear electric power station waste is stored for the next 
millenium. In 1,000 years time, is some cataclysm were to 
occur, the processed nuclear fuel will no longer present a 
danger. 
  New methods are now being developed for destroying nuclear 
waste -- its burning in special devices and its use in 
fast-neutron reactors. 
  [Khokhlov] But can you explain why then Finland is reluctant 
to bury the waste from its "Lovisa" nuclear electric power 
station somewhere in the tundra and is exporting them to us? 
  [Mikhaylov] It does not have the conditions and technology 
for processing; we do. And it is economically advantageous for 
Russia to accept waste! They pay for it, they pay very well. A 
fight is now under way on the nuclear waste market between the 
United States, France, and Britain. Russia is also taking part. 
It means big money, which we invest in, inter alia, the 
improvement of the safety of Russian nuclear electric power 
stations. Incidentally, the Finns are already considering 
whether to pay us money or to keep their waste in their own 
country. 
  [Khokhlov] Does Russia bear responsibility for the safety of 
nuclear electric power stations in CIS and Baltic states? 
  [Mikhaylov] No. Since the collapse of the USSR these have 
been domestic problems for sovereign states. Politicians treat 
this very zealously. But we Russian nuclear scientists are open 
to cooperation with everyone. Armenia has decided to resume the 
operation of its nuclear electric power station -- we are 
helping. 
  [Khokhlov] One more problem connected with the collapse of 
the USSR: An underground nuclear charge ready for explosion 
remains in Kazakhstan. What will happen to it? 
  [Mikhaylov] We are preparing to dismantle the driving 
mechanism [zabivochnoye ustroystvo] and we shall either remove 
the nuclear device or destroy it on the spot. It is small in 
terms of yield -- less than one kilotonne. It is not a military 
charge but a simulator. Anticipating a question about the 
ecology, I shall say there will be no problems. 
  [Khokhlov] On the other hand, it seems many problems are 
arising in connection with the raising of the sunken 
nuclear-powered submarine Komsomolets? 
  [Mikhaylov] The din raised over this submarine in my opinion 
is in direct proportion to the sums which certain groups of 
people could obtain for carrying out the raising operation. 
There is a very great deal of speculation surrounding the 
Komsomolets and its nuclear "stuffing...." 
  Raising a ship from such a depth and under such extreme 
conditions is impossible. I said so back in 1992. Especially 
as there is no need. There is no leakage of plutonium -- all 
the tests show that. We should leave the Komsomolets on the sea 
bed. The ship will disappear into the silt and nature itself 
will do a better job than people of neutralizing the nuclear 
weapons in it. 
  [Khokhlov] How many people are now employed in the Russian 
nuclear weapons complex? 
  [Mikhaylov] Over 100,000. These people are one of Russia's 
chief resources. Unfortunately, they are now having quite a 
difficult time living and working. The total "marketness" into 
which they have tried to push the nuclear sector, the shortage 
of funds and our utterly primitive conversion have markedly 
reduced the return from both science and industry. The sector's 
steady development can be achieved only with state economic 
regulation. Yes, we can produce the world's best saucepans which 
will be competitive on markets from Africa to America, but do we 
really need to enter the new century with saucepans? 
  In the very near future only those countries in which high 
technologies are developed will be able to live properly. I 
want Russia to be one of them. 
  [Khokhlov] In June the Russian defense industry intends to 
go on strike. Will the nuclear scientists support them? 
  [Mikhaylov] We are forbidden by law to go on strike. 
  [Khokhlov] What is the average wage in the sector now? 
  [Mikhaylov] In the industry, specialists receive an average 
of R230,000, at a nuclear electric power station they get 
R420,000. Our scientists are poorer -- the average salary is 
R150,000. It is true that we have been able to increase wages 
at the Arzamas-16 and Chelyabinsk-70 federal nuclear centers to 
R250,000. In 1993 some 6-8 percent of what were not the worst 
specialists left the Ministry of Atomic Energy for commercial 
structures. A pity. 
  But it is surprising that given the miserly salaries and the 
paltry "grants" from the state budget for the development of 
science and industry, given the fact that fixed capital is more 
than 50 percent worn out, the Ministry of Atomic Energy is 
working with an exceptional return. On many salients we are 
still "ahead of the whole planet." Research and applied work is 
under way in the field of nuclear physics, high-energy and 
superconductivity physics, thermonuclear fusion, and 
electronics.... Only patriots can work in these conditions. If 
the sector is allowed to survive now it will be of enormous 
benefit to Russia. 
  [Khokhlov] Viktor Nikitovich, no one has yet denied the 
famous formula "if you want peace, prepare for war." Our first 
atom bomb was created by Kurchatov, our first hydrogen bomb by 
Sakharov, and third-generation weapons are our "baby." Is the 
appearance of a new type of weapon in the very near future 
possible? 
  [Mikhaylov] I think so. If mankind is unable to renounce 
military atomic energy completely, then such a weapon could 
appear by the year 2000. 
  [Khokhlov] How will it differ from existing models? 
  [Mikhaylov] The nuclear warheads now available are usually 
called highly effective. The new, fourth, generation will be 
guided weapons [napravlennogo deystviya]. 
  [Khokhlov] Can you predict who the inventors of this weapon 
will be -- Russian or U.S. scientists? 
  [Mikhaylov] It is hard to say. Breakthroughs in science 
depend little on the economic or political situation in a 
country. And our scientists' brains work no worse than those of 
the Americans. 
  [Khokhlov] What does Russia's chief "hawk" dream of? 
  [Mikhaylov] Of peace. But we still have a powerful struggle 
for it.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Marina Barinova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 6 TASS -- "Russia's atomic industry is 
now on the brink of stoppage", Vladimir Startsev, chairman of 
the Central Committee of the Russian atomic energy industry 
trade union, told a news conference on Monday. He said that the 
precarious situation that developed in the nuclear energy 
complex resulted from non-payment by the Russian Grid 
joint-stock company for the electricity received from nuclear 
power stations. The company ran up a debt of 674 billion rubles. 
  Planned work to ensure safe operation of nuclear power 
stations had to be stopped because of the lack of funds. Unless 
the situation changes, the Balakovo nuclear power station will 
have to be shut down for safety reasons in June. The station's 
operators salaries are in arrears for three months. "Operators 
are despairing and the situation may get out of control any 
time", Startsev said. 
  The work of the entire nuclear fuel cycle is paralysed by 
the 
lack of funds, Lev Ryabev, Russian first deputy minister of 
nuclear power, told reporters. Production amalgamation 
"Mashinostritelny Zavod" stopped the manufacture of clusters of 
fuel elements. The Chepetsk mechanical plant producing 
zirconium was stopped. There is a similar situation at 
complexes in Krasnoyarsk-26, Tomsk-7, Kirovo-Chepetsk and at 
nuclear machine building plants. 
  It will be necessary to lower the capacity of power 
generating sets at nuclear stations to prolong their operation 
with the use of whatever fuel remains, Ryabev said. If a 
nuclear power plant is shut down, it will take seven to ten 
years for reactors to cool off. Fuel storages will have to be 
maintained in a safe state. This will require the consumption 
of large amounts of electricity, and hence huge outlays. 
  In view of the fact that funds needed for the maintenance of 
normal operation of stations are not allocated, the Russian 
Ministry of Nuclear Power Industry and the Central Committee of 
the trade union made a proposal to the State Duma to envisage 
the allocation to nuclear power stations of 560 billion rubles 
from the budget on easy terms when the Russian budget for 1994 
is finally drawn up. If this proposal is not accepted, it will 
take a much larger sum, over one thousand billion rubles, to 
shut off nuclear stations.

  [Text] A cooperation agreement has been signed between the 
independent trade union of servicemen and the Defense Ministry. 
  According to Mikhail Kolchev, chairman of the trade union, 
everyone will benefit from this step, but above all former 
military men who were forced to retire due to army cuts. This 
year alone more than 180,000 officers will be leaving the army, 
and each subsequent year the plan is to cut 50,000 officers. 
The independent trade union's task is to uphold these people's 
interests and provide them with social and legal protection. An 
agreement of this kind has been signed not only with the Defense 
Ministry, but with other power ministries as well.

  [Text] Moscow June 6 TASS -- Chechen opposition leader 
Yaragi Mamodayev denounced Sunday's decision by the Chechen 
government and parliament to ban former Russian parliament 
chairman Ruslan Khasbulatov from the republic. 
  The decision also affects former Chechen communist leader 
Doka Zavgayev. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday, Mamodayev said 
that 
"instead of seeking reconciliation, Dudayev's regime takes steps 
causing the situation to worsen." 
  He also brushed off accusations of alleged involvement, 
together with Russia, in preparations to remove Dzhokhar Dudayev 
from power. "We do not want confrontation or opposition between 
various parts of the Chechen population. We call for 
reconciliation and political dialogue," he said. 
  Mamodayev stressed that the way out from the current crisis 
is through a constructive dialogue and the soonest possible 
economic reform.

<F P=106> [Natalya Gorodetskaya report under the "Caucasus" rubric: </F>
"Groznyy Accuses Moscow of `Stage-By-Stage' Occupation"] 
  [Excerpt] Moscow's silence on the repeated statements by 
Groznyy officials to the effect that the Chechen-Russian talks 
should be held at the foreign ministry level, or -- better -- at 
the presidential level, makes leaders of the Chechen Republic 
nervous and suspect Russia of nurturing "plans of occupation." 
  Shortly before a Chechen opposition congress, which was set 
for 4 June in Nadterechnyy Rayon, which does not take orders 
from the president, the republic's state security department 
stated that this congress was prepared by Russia's Foreign 
Intelligence Service as yet another stage in the "stage-by-stage 
occupation of Chechnya." In Groznyy's view, the preceding stages 
included the introduction of a state of emergency on part of 
Sunzhenskiy and Malgobekskiy Rayons of Ingushetia, which border 
on Chechnya, and the failed attempt on the life of Dzhokhar 
Dudayev. 
  The congress, according to the forecasts of Chechnya's state 
security department, was supposed to lend legal status to the 
Temporary Council created by the opposition in winter 1994. 
This was to be followed by the opposition's appeal to Russia 
that it recognize this organ and support it with military force 
under any pretext. The "puppet" Temporary Council would then 
sign the Federal Treaty of the Russian Federation which would 
amount to Chechnya's becoming part of the Russian Federation. 
Shortly before the congress, as Chechnya's Foreign Ministry 
maintained, Russian troops were brought to the republic's 
borders, while on the territory of North Ossetia 26 combat 
helicopters with special subunits ready for aggression were on 
full combat alert. The opposition congress, however, did not 
take place on 4 June "due to the absence of a quorum," according 
to a representative of the Chechen Republic president's staff.

<F P=106> [Gennadiy Sobolev report: "Lever of Equilibrium. Kalmykia, </F>
Crimea, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia Have Joined the `North 
Caucasus' Association"] 
  [Text] "The past does not divide us, it merely reminds us 
that the future of Russia and the Caucasus are entwined.... 
Recognizing that the Caucasian war was a tragedy for all the 
peoples of the Caucasus, we must strive for cooperation, mutual 
understanding, and peace in the region." These were the words 
of Nikolay Yegorov, speaking for the first time as Russian 
minister for nationalities affairs, at a rally in Nalchik. It 
is well known that in Krasnodar Kray, whose administration he 
used to head, he actually managed to prove that such mutual 
understanding is possible: Interethnic conflicts were avoided 
in this area where representatives of various peoples live. It 
is no accident that it was Yegorov's idea to assemble the 
political leaders of the North Caucasus at a major council which 
would enable them to pool their resources in order to tackle 
common tasks more effectively. 
  The next step on this road was the conference of the "North 
Caucasus" Social and Economic Cooperation Association held just 
the other day in Krasnodar; this was attended by official 
delegations from the region's republics, krays, and oblasts, as 
well as representatives from Volgograd Oblast, Kalmykia, Crimea, 
Abkhazia, and South Ossetia. 
  Association Chairman Nikolay Pivovarov announced that at the 
conference Kalmykia was granted permanent membership of the 
"North Caucasus" Association, and Crimea, Abkhazia, and South 
Ossetia were granted associate membership. 
  Vladislav Ardzinba, chairman of the Abkhazian Supreme 
Council, announced that "the Abkhazian leadership opposes the 
division of the Caucasian peoples by new state borders" and 
supports "the restoration of comprehensive ties that have been 
broken off." Consequently, he expressed his satisfaction that 
Abkhazia has been granted associate membership of the "North 
Caucasus" Social and Economic Cooperation Association. 
  For its part, Crimea too needs effective contacts with 
neighboring regions of the Black Sea coast. There are plenty of 
reasons for this, one of which is the problem of the Crimean 
Tatars which has flared up recently. Suffice it to recall the 
recent speech delivered in Simferopol by Mustafa Dzhamilev, 
chairman of the Crimean Tatar People's Assembly. At the present 
time, he stated, thousands of Tatars returning to Crimea "find 
themselves in a tragic and frightening situation." At the same 
time, in his opinion, certain difficulties are being 
artificially created by forces "which advocate the idea that 
Crimea belongs to Russia." 
  Bearing in mind that, according to some reports, the Crimean 
Tatars are starting to receive weapons illegally from Turkey, it 
is clear that the unpredictable "Tatar factor" could become the 
catalyst for a major conflict on the peninsula. And the 
position of the North Caucasus republics, united as they are in 
a social and economic cooperation association, could serve as a 
stabilizing lever of equilibrium in Crimea given their religious 
affiliation.

<F P=106> [Correspondent Viktor Chemodurov "Commentary": "Rutskoy </F>
Attacks the Provinces"] 
  [Text] Kursk -- Aleksandr Rutskoy has been spending a few 
days in Kursk, combining the celebration of his mother's 
birthday with a series of public speeches to the people of his 
own region. The character of the speeches is not in doubt: The 
former vice president has launched an energetic campaign to win 
votes in the future presidential election. He is doing so, 
moreover, in the provinces, which to a large extent will 
determine the outcome. 
  The former vice president now states in plain terms only one 
or, to be more precise, two interrelated goals: Repealing the 
current Constitution and holding an early election. He has said 
not a single word about any intention on his part to run when 
the time comes, but that does not, of course, mean that there is 
no such intention. That intention is clear in every word 
uttered by the garrulous orator, who adroitly brought the 
audience at the Khimvolokno joint-stock company's culture 
complex around to the idea that no better "savior of Russia" 
than he is to be found. And he did so by the method of 
negation, so to speak. 
  It was a rare politician who did not get a mention in his 
impassioned monologue, and it turns out that there is indeed no 
one worthier than Aleksandr Vladimir in Russia. Scathing, 
off-the-cuff descriptions were dished out right and left. There 
was no need to say anything even about our currently thriving 
president or the "Yeltsin gang" -- for them there is only "one 
route, the route to the cells." Viktor Chernomyrdin, the 
"presidential appointee," repeats over and over his favorite 
saying "let's work, let's work," but does nothing. 
  The former vice president's vocabulary has become 
substantially richer of late as regards the democratic 
reformers. Many newer descriptions have appeared to supplement 
widely known ones such as the "kids in pink pants". For 
example, the minister for nationalities questions is suspect 
because he "only learned to blow his nose five years ago." And 
how, the orator asked, "was it possible to entrust the economy 
to someone who has never held anything except a spoon, a 
fountain-pen, and perhaps one other thing in his hands?!" Guess 
who? 
  Roughly the same was said of representatives of the various 
shades of opposition. The name "Travkin-Murkin" (my apologies, 
I merely quote -- V.Ch.) is reinforced by the image of a 
weathercock. Ivan Rybkin "has trimmed to fit the mold." While 
Gennadiy Zyuganov is blameworthy because Rutskoy saw him on TV 
on 2 October last urging the population to refrain from 
demonstrations or other dangerous acts. 
  And so it went on. I apologize to all the people mentioned 
here for citing these coarse insults. I do so only because 
readers and voters should know what language our head of state 
will be using with Russia and the rest of the world if Rutskoy 
fills that role. 
  And the fear does exist, after all, that he could. At any 
rate, it should not be discounted. The "democratic" language of 
the barrack room, spiced with populist views on politics and the 
economy, falls on fertile soil and does go down well, you know. 
At the Khimvolokno joint-stock company's culture complex, the 
hall, designed to hold 700 people, accommodated at least twice 
that number, and thousands were left outside to listen through 
loudspeakers. It would be bad enough if they had simply 
listened and formed critical judgments, but they excitedly 
applauded passages in Rutskoy's speech.... 
  Clearly, aware himself of a certain similarity, Aleksandr 
Vladimirovich deemed it necessary to stress his difference from 
Zhirinovskiy, and he did this, of course, in his own inimitable 
way: "You mustn't bamboozle people as Vladimir Volfovich does; 
I have told him repeatedly: Cool it, man, cool it!" 
  Of course, Rutskoy acts much more subtly and adroitly than 
Zhirinovskiy. On the whole his speech produced a perfectly 
seemly impression. Everything looks as if it is dictated by 
great concern for the country's future and for the people and is 
emotional only for that reason. And even the coarse language 
that spilled off Aleksandr Vladimirovich's lips caused a hum of 
approval: Everyone understood that he spoke from the heart -- 
the disgraceful things going on around us are more than a person 
can endure! Moreover, it turns out that this person is simple 
and down to earth. 
  Great doubt arises, however, as to whether there is a 
fundamental difference between the "concepts" of Rutskoy and 
those of Zhirinovskiy. True, Aleksandr Vladimirovich did 
repeatedly stress that order in the country must be introduced 
by "economic methods." But here he recalled with manifest 
pleasure a little scene espied in Singapore: Right in front of 
him policemen were using bamboo sticks to administer a lesson to 
an offender who had discarded a cigarette stub or spat in the 
street.... 
  But all this finds a broad and very vigorous response in 
conditions where local authorities demonstrate a staggering lack 
of will in pursuing reforms; where representatives of the 
authorities actually steal everything that is not nailed down by 
the state and create nothing at all for the common good; and 
where in the last oblast Duma elections the heads of 
administration roughly elbowed aside all candidates capable of 
bringing into local lawmaking the interests of other social 
groups and strata, have since impoverished local lawmaking to 
the maximum extent, and now hold sessions without even letting 
representatives of the press in. 
  These are the conditions in which leaders like Rutskoy are 
snatching success. It is certainly time for politicians -- 
major and minor -- to open their eyes and realize that it will 
not be only the capital voting in the forthcoming presidential 
election. If things do not change very quickly in the provinces, 
then (God forbid!) the prophecy of a great cataclysm in Russia 
will come to pass. And that cataclysm will come not from the 
East but from places like Kursk or Voronezh. At any rate, that 
is the way it looks today to your observer from the provinces.

<F P=106> [Article by Tatyana Korneyeva: "Formal Minimum Wage and Real </F>
Earnings Are Different Things..."] 
  [Text] A lively discussion ensued at yesterday's 
meeting of the Tatarstan Supreme Soviet's Planning and Budget 
Commission upon presentation of the Republic of Tatarstan 
Government draft "On the Minimum Wage," which envisages, 
beginning 1 July, setting the minimum wage at R50,000 instead of 
the current R30,000. 
  The arguments in favor of the draft law submitted by the 
Tatarstan Government, which were incorporated in the report of 
Deputy Prime Minister Ravil Muratov, boiled down to the 
following: It is necessary to raise the minimum wage in order to 
avoid a sharp decline in the republic population's standard of 
living because of a sharp jump in prices. However, the presenter 
noted, we cannot allow the Unified Pay Scale level I salary to 
be set at R50,000, since it will cause leveling in labor 
remuneration of the workers in the budget and production spheres 
and may lead to social tensions. 
  Planning and Budget Commission Chairman Geliy Kobelev and 
the 
Tatarstan people's deputies did have strong objections, which 
they voiced to the presenter. As one of the opponents justly 
noted, one can issue a directive to set the minimum wage at 
R100,000 or even R1 million, but what will it change in 
principle if enterprises do not have money and back pay is owed 
for months? So what is the point of adopting another law that 
will not work? It is already clear that setting the minimum wage 
at R30,000 did not result in raising the average wage in 
February-May. 
  Meanwhile, questions arise when these categories are 
compared 
in Russia and Tatarstan. With the minimum wage in the Russian 
Federation being R14,600, in March the average wage rose to over 
R170,000, while in our republic, where the minimum is set much 
higher, average earnings amount to only R140,000. 
  The commission came to the conclusion that the materials 
attached to the draft law do not contain sufficient analysis of 
the consequences and do not identify the sources to cover the 
attendant additional budget expenditures. 
  If we are to accept such a draft law, it needs clear 
justification that will take into account the interests of 
industrial enterprises, first and foremost the defense industry. 
  The preliminary analysis as to what raising the minimum wage 
will produce is already taking shape. And it is far from 
optimistic. If the law is adopted, the taxable base will 
inevitably shrink, which means losses for the revenue part of 
the budget, which are estimated to exceed R200 billion. Overall, 
additional expenditures and loss of income are estimated at R350 
billion, or R50 million a month with the actual budget revenue 
being an average of R80 billion monthly. This means that the 
government will have to take some steps to increase the budget 
revenue. 
  The deputies were unanimous in the opinion that this draft 
law once again will not affect the pay of the budget sphere 
workers, since the proposal is to adopt it without taking into 
account the Unified Pay Scale. It will, however, necessitate 
changes in the Tatarstan law "On the Republic of Tatarstan 
Budget System for 1994," since the 2.5-fold wage raise for 
budget organizations, which is built into the budget, is pegged 
on a minimum wage of no more than R30,000 until the end of the 
year. 
  It was also quite reasonably pointed out that our entire 
legislative base is pegged on the minimum wage, and in the event 
this law passes, fines calculated on a factor of R50,000 will 
become astronomical, which actually will lead to a result 
directly opposite that intended -- decline in the population's 
income. To this Ravil Muratov offered a compromise solution: 
Since Russian Federation laws are in effect on the Tatarstan 
territory, fines may be applied on the basis of the Russian 
minimum wage, that is, R14,600. The presenter's reasoning was 
not accepted, however. 
  As one of the deputies remarked, with this draft law we once 
again attempt to cure the symptoms rather than the disease. And 
the disease is the republic's extremely difficult economic 
situation. The program of anticrisis measures, which the 
deputies had instructed the government to develop before 25 May, 
was supposed to help. Instead, they offered to discuss only the 
draft of "Priority Measures for Stabilization of Republic of 
Tatarstan Economy." But this document -- the substance of which 
was presented at the commission meeting by Filza Khamidullin, a 
deputy prime minister and the chairman of the State Committee 
for Economics and Forecasting -- also raised serious questions 
among the deputies. 
  In Geliy Kobelev's opinion, the draft of "Priority 
Measures..." lacks clarity and specifics in such critically 
important matters as overcoming the insolvency crisis, bringing 
down the rate of production decline, providing guarantees for 
the timely payment of wages, and the operation of the bills of 
exchange system. The commission returned the draft law "On the 
Minimum Wage" for modifications and recommended to consider it 
simultaneously with the draft law on the adjusted budget.

Demands 131 Million Rubles From Two Papers"] 
  [Text] Kostroma -- Yuriy Litvinov, the Russian Federation 
president's representative in Kostroma Oblast, has 
simultaneously sued two newspapers -- KOSTROMSKOY KRAY and 
KOSTROMSKIYE VEDOMOSTI for defamation, demanding 131,516 rubles 
in compensation for psychological damage. 
  Some months ago pieces were published first im KOSTROMSKOY 
KRAY and then in KOSTROMSKIYE VEDOMOSTI which Yuriy Litvinov 
regards as spurious. In particular, his former assistant 
Valeriy Deryugin, in an interview with a KOSTROMSKOY KRAY 
correspondent, claimed that Yuriy Litvinov had violated the 
president's edict on the fight against corruption by enabling 
commercial structures to make extensive use of equipment and 
communications facilities in the representation's offices. Both 
papers also said that the president's representative in Kostroma 
Oblast had allegedly used military equipment in the shape of an 
infantry fighting vehicle to go hunting in Buyskiy Rayon. 
  The president's representative strongly denies these and 
other charges.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Viktor Yelmakov] </F>
  [Text] Novosibirsk, 7 Jun -- A six-page memorandum 
originating from the Ministry of Nationalities Affairs and 
Regional Policy has fallen into the hands of local newspaper 
editors and local bureaus of the central mass media. The 
document assesses the socio-economic position of Novosibirsk 
Oblast. 
  In it, Moscow-based experts write: "Income levels of 
Novosibirsk Oblast residents have dropped to 37.4 percent of 
Moscow levels, while per capita budget provisions in the oblast 
amount to 46 percent of the average figure for Western Siberia". 
Excessive militarization of the area's economy has been singled 
out as being among the causes of this disastrous showing. 
Having relaxed the reins in the running of the economy, the 
state has left Novosibirsk Oblast residents outside the scope of 
reforms: Neither military production nor defense-oriented 
science can adjust to the new conditions.

  [Text] The Pacific Fleet Command has notified the 
inhabitants of Maritime Kray (Far East) of the completion of 
work on clearing the territories of population centers and 
agricultural land in the proximity of the Pacific Fleet's arms 
dump at Novonezhino (70 km from Vladivostok). 
  A fire and an explosion occurred at that dump 14-15 May as a 
result of servicemen's negligence, causing economic damage to 
the region in excess of 30 billion rubles. 
  The explosion scattered a large quantity of ammunition 
around 
the nearby areas, posing a threat to the population. 
  Sappers and others involved in eliminating the aftermath of 
the explosion have also fully inspected a 3-km-wide belt around 
the dump and rendered harmless dangerous explosive objects. 
  The population can now embark on normal activities, while 
being urged not to slacken vigilance. On 31 May a 2-meter 
rocket thrown out by the blast wave 15 days previously was 
extracted from the ground in the truck garden of a resident of 
the village of Romanovka, which is approximately 10 km from the 
epicenter of the explosions, the newspaper VLADIVOSTOK has 
reported.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report from "Inform" column: "Using Chairman </F>
Mao's Method"] 
  [Text] In Maritime Kray the militia, chekists, and border 
guards have carried out a very large "purge" among foreigners. 
As we know, the guests from adjacent states have for a long 
time now been held in no great respect in the Far East. The 
authorities and special services intended at least to recount 
them. The effect was striking: Over the course of a week 
nearly 2,000 foreign citizens were discovered living illegally 
on the kray's territory. They are mainly Chinese who crossed the 
Russian border as tourists and then settled in oru country. 
  Some were fined for a lapsed visa, some had criminal 
proceedings brought against them for possessing false passports, 
and 944 PRC citizens were immediately deported to their 
historical homeland. (Incidentally, there has not been a single 
protest from the Chinese authorities). 
  The operation is not ended. It has become known that many of 
our "guests" have settled deep in the taiga settlements, since 
the wild fruit harvesting season is approaching. Militia 
detachments have been sent there. Some people will be very 
unlucky on the narrow path of war in the Ussuri taiga....

<F P=106> [Video report by correspondent R. Babayan; from the "Vesti" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] According to the approved agenda, parliamentarians 
[of the Crimean Supreme Council] are to deal with two issues: 
The first issue deals with the composition and structure of the 
Crimean Cabinet of Ministers. The second issue deals with 
giving decrees by President Meshkov the status of laws of the 
Crimean Republic, but only in cases when they refer to the 
issues that are not temporarily reflected in the Constitution of 
the Crimean state. 
  Speaking to Supreme Council deputies, Yuriy Meshkov said 
that 
their civic duty is to approve the proposed composition and 
structure of the Crimean Government as soon as possible. 
Meshkov continued and warned the deputies that otherwise the 
Cabinet of Ministers will be approved by a special decree of the 
president. In doing so, he referred to the March opinion poll 
of the population. Deputies had an extremely negative reaction 
to the ultimatum-like statement by their president. In their 
opinion, Yuriy Meshkov does not have the right to approve the 
structure and membership of the Cabinet of Ministers by his 
decree. Incidentally, parliamentarians stated that the 
president's referral to the poll of the population is not 
convincing, as a poll is not a referendum and consequently its 
results should not be regarded as the will of the peninsula's 
citizens. Crimean parliamentarians are convinced that such 
behavior on the part of Yuriy Meshkov pursues only one goal--to 
establish a regime of dictatorship in the Crimea.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 4/6/1994 -- "The leadership of 
the Dniester Republic considers the crisis in Crimea an internal 
affair of the Ukraine," declared to BASA Valeriy Litskay, state 
secretary of the self-proclaimed Dniester Republic. He 
mentioned that the Tiraspol officials are keeping in touch with 
Crimean leaders, but, in his opinion, these contacts are a 
matter of routine. According to the state secretary, the 
Simferopol authorities, despite rumours, have not asked for 
support from Tiraspol. Referring to the notion of creating a 
union of unrecognized states, suggested by the leaders of 
Nagorno-Karabakh, Valeriy Litskay stressed that the Tiraspol 
officials had not been officially requested to enter this union. 
"We had not been offered documents such as the statute or the 
program of the union. Our position concerning the Union of 
Unrecognized States will depend solely on the contents of such 
documents," mentioned Litskay.

<F P=106> [Interview with Crimean Vice Prime Minister Yevgeniy Saburov </F>
by Aleksandr Ryabushev in Simferopol; date not given: "Yevgeniy 
Saburov: Vice Prime Minister Worth $30"] 
  [Text] Simferopol -- Yevgeniy Saburov's Moscow team does 
not suit the Crimean parliamentarians. The vice prime minister 
has left the Supreme Council for the umpteenth time without yet 
being able to get his cabinet of ministers ratified at a 
session. Why? 
  [Saburov] The deputies simply had a poor grasp of the 
situation. Clan mentality is very developed in the Crimea. A 
battle is under way. New people have come to power in 
parliament who are hungry and have an interest in ensuring that 
ministerial portfolios go to their men. They are guided not by 
the interests of their voters, but by short-term considerations. 
  [Ryabushev] How is this reflected? 
  [Saburov] First and foremost I have proposed a minimal 
cabinet -- eight ministers. Three of them are Muscovites -- 
Agriculture Minister Sergey Nikolskiy, Finance Minister Lyudmila 
Zaytseva, and Economics Minister Andrey Chernyavskiy -- the rest 
are Crimeans. But this breakdown did not suit parliament -- it 
wants to ratify its own overblown cabinet of ministers which 
will not be subject to my confirmation. They want it to include 
a Ministry of Health, a Ministry of Education, and a Ministry of 
Mountains and Beaches. On the one hand, you can understand them 
-- after all, most of the new members of parliament are teachers 
and doctors. But I need primarily economists and specialists who 
understand that there are as yet no funds to pay for ministers 
in the social and cultural sphere. That money needs to be 
earned. That is why I propose to create ministries which will 
be able to do so. Ministers must, above all, be professionals, 
not officials. They must be able to earn their pay. 
  [Ryabushev] Incidentally, what are you paid? 
  [Saburov] Believe it or not, I am the cheapest vice prime 
minister; my current pay is 1.5 million karbovantsy -- or $30 at 
the market rate. The president earns $40. My acting ministers 
earn $25. 
  [Ryabushev] Is it worth feeling like a Muscovite hostage for 
money like that? After all, you earned 15 times more in Moscow. 
  [Saburov] I have come here to sincerely help to develop the 
Crimean economy. My friend Yuriy Meshkov invited me. After 
all, I am a Crimean -- I was born in Yalta -- so I do not feel 
like an outsider here and I intend to continue to try to 
persuade parliament to ratify my version of the cabinet of 
ministers. 
  [Ryabushev] You met with Max Van Der Stoel, CSCE high 
commissioner for ethnic minorities, 2 June. What did you talk 
about? 
  [Saburov] I outlined the situation in the Crimea for him, 
and suggested that he provide help in ensuring European training 
for our parliamentary deputies. I talked about what we need to 
do in order to find a way out of the Crimean impasse. 
  [Ryabushev] And what does need to be done? 
  [Saburov] We need to hold talks, rule out the use of force, 
develop the economy, and harmonize Ukrainian and Crimean 
legislation [privesti v normu zakonodatelstva Ukrainy i Kryma], 
removing laws that contradict each other. Incidentally, the 
CSCE high commissioner and UN expert Vladimir Butkevich, who 
currently heads the Ukrainian Supreme Council working group at 
the talks with the Crimean Supreme Council commission, agree 
with this. 
  [Ryabushev] How do you see the future of the Crimea? 
  [Saburov] First and foremost, within Ukraine, and with 
transparent borders. Dual citizenship along the lines of 
European standards. Well organized social and cultural links 
with Russia. Private international capital. Recreation and an 
elite agricultural sector. Transport arteries, airfields, 
ports, and a bridge of friendship between East and West.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F>
Mikhail Melnik] 
  [Text] Kharkov, 6 June -- Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk said a new government must be formed as soon as next 
week. He was in Kharkov today, speaking at a meeting of leaders 
of agricultural machine building enterprises. He said that 
first and foremost it is necessary to confirm the prime 
minister, who is to submit to the Supreme Soviet a list of 
cabinet ministers. The president said that he has held 
consultations and meetings with members of standing commissions, 
factions, and parliament. The meetings considered approaches to 
the way the Cabinet of Ministers is to be formed and proposed 
possible candidacies. 
  Those invited to the meeting, apart from Leonid Kravchuk, 
were leaders of nearly 200 enterprises and more than 30 
organizations involved in science and design. The most 
important issues concerning relations between enterprises and 
the state were raised. It was noted that these are now on the 
brink of crisis. Because of the disruption in economic links 
with countries of the CIS, shortage of resources and transport, 
some enterprises have been standing idle for several months a 
year, having no money to pay their workers. 
  "State factories must be given the opportunity to use 
civilized methods to sell their goods," according to Valentin 
Boblik, director general of the Kharkov tractor works. "It is no 
longer possible to use barter deals exchanging tractors, 
combines, and sowers for rice, buckwheat, sugar, and gasoline." 
  Speaking at the meeting, Leonid Kravchuk said that Ukraine 
has a rather well-developed production and scientific base to 
produce machinery. However, a critical situation has arisen, 
because of a number of instances of poor coordination, the 
stalling of economic reforms, and the disruption in economic 
links in most branches of industry and agriculture. He said 
that he has signed a decree on urgent measures to improve 
financial and credit provision, and to form state food resources 
for 1994-95. The president said he is happy with the position 
taken by some leaders of enterprises who said that they no 
longer need credits. This position is correct, he said. In 
their opinion, these resources must be urgently channelled into 
agriculture so as to enable collective and state farms to buy 
technology. Leonid Kravchuk said that the decree provides for 
precisely such mechanisms.

<F P=106> [From the "Parliamentary Chronicle" feature] </F>
  [Text] 
<H5>  Kiev, 31 May </H5>
  The first speech at the morning sitting of the parliament 
was 
delivered by the President of Turkey, who was warmly welcomed by 
the MP's. The President of Turkey stressed that his country 
pays a special importance to the question of the Ukraine's 
territorial integrity. After that the session continued its 
work on forming the parliamentary standing committees. The 
deputies received the list of candidates for heads of the 
parliamentary committees, which immediately pushed 
representatives of the parliamentary factions to the 
microphones. There was the preliminary agreement to vote for 
the heads of parliamentary committees by the list, but now some 
deputies found surprises there. The right-oriented deputies 
said that their proposals were not included in full and the 
quotas were violated. In particular, the list included more 
representatives of the group "Ednist" (Unity) and agrarians than 
it was before. There were remarks that the list was prepared 
not in accordance with the principle of professionalism, but on 
the party principle, and that is why it could not be adopted for 
voting. The left-oriented representatives insisted on voting 
for the list as a whole. After the break the deputies approved 
the list of heads of standing committees by the majority of 
votes. Speaker of the parliament Oleksandre Moroz made a speech 
on the tasks for the Supreme Council and the parliamentary 
standing committees. Then the parliament worked on the draft 
regulations for the Supreme Council, which was adopted in its 
initial wording. 
<H5>  Kiev, 1 June </H5>
  How to regulate the situation in the Crimea was the first 
question on the agenda after the parliamentary standing 
committees were formed. President Kravchuk made a speech before 
the MP's on this subject. Giving an analysis of the recent 
events in the peninsular and actions undertaken by the Crimea's 
leaders, President Kravchuk said: "Ignoring the constitutional 
demands and Ukrainian laws is not a simple mistake, but a 
strategy of the Crimea's present leaders and the party, which 
came to power in the Crimea. This strategy is aimed at the 
complete separation from Ukraine, with further joining to 
Russia." The President of Ukraine submitted to the parliament 
the proposals on how to manage the situation in the Crimea, 
which are based on a clear and stable position: The Crimea was 
and must be an integrative part of Ukraine. All illegal 
resolutions and decisions recently taken by the leaders of the 
Crimea must be cancelled and brought into accord with the 
Ukrainian Constitution and laws. Mr. Kravchuk answered to the 
questions of the MP's. After an extensive discussion the 
Supreme Council of Ukraine took the Resolution "Fulfillment of 
the Resolution of the Supreme Council of Ukraine of 24 February 
1994 "Status of the Autonomic Republic of Crimea According to 
the President Ukrainian Constitution and Laws" and the 
Resolution of the Supreme Council of Ukraine of 20 May 1994 
"Termination of Validity of the Law of the Republic of Crimea 
"Re-Establishment of Constitutional Grounds for the Statehood of 
the Republic of Crimea". [quotation marks as received] The 
resolution was adopted with 202 votes after the long-lasting 
discussion. 
<H5>  Kiev, 2 June </H5>
  At the beginning of the morning sitting the Supreme Council 
adopted the Resolution "Amendment in Wording of Item 4 of the 
Resolution of the Supreme Council of Ukraine "Fulfillment of the 
Resolution of the Supreme Council of Ukraine of 20 May 1994 
"Termination of Validity of the Law of the Republic of Crimea 
"Reestablishment of Constitutional Grounds for the Statehood of 
the Republic of Crimea." [quotation marks as received] Deputy 
from Bukovina Heorhiy Filipchuk was elected the Head of the 
Committee for Ecology, who was proposed to this post by 
Vyacheslav Chornovil as a candidate from Rukh. The Ukrainian 
President's letter on the 26 June elections evoked great 
interest and extensive discussion. According to one of MP's from 
Zaporizhya, this question was a "cross-road" for many opinions. 
The majority, judging from the speeches, were for the elections 
to be held at the appointed date. Other deputies proposed to 
prepare the respective legislative base and then to hold the 
elections immediately. Interesting was the opinion to elect the 
heads of regional councils at the parliamentary session, but not 
by a direct voting, which may lead to 26 "Crimeas" in Ukraine. 
Leonid Kravchuk, who participated at the meeting, considers 
that the MP's concentrated their attention only on the question 
of postponing the elections for the president, but almost 
ignored his proposition that, provided the Supreme Council 
prepares and adopts the necessary legislative documents before 
the date set for the presidential elections, he will not be 
against. 
<H5>  Kiev, 3 June </H5>
  A draft on introduction of amendments and supplements to the 
Law of Ukraine "Forming the Local Power and Self-Governing 
Organs" was discussed a day before. In particular, this document 
provided for canceling the direct elections for heads of local 
councils. So this question evoked sharp debates yesterday. But 
this position, if adopted, would considerably change the status 
of the heads of local councils, in one hand, and the approach to 
the regional economic policy, on the other hand. Arguments 
"for" and "against" concerning this issue might be considered 
logical, if not for the fact that the legal and legislative base 
of Ukraine are not ready for the direct elections for heads of 
local councils. In particular, there was raised the questions: 
If heads of local councils are elected, to whom they will be 
subordinate; who will control their activities? Deputies to 
local councils must take control over this question, but 
meanwhile, the legal acts do not strictly regulate these 
positions. So, this was the question under debates. But in 
order to cancel the direct elections it is necessary to 
introduce a number of amendments and supplements to the current 
legislation of Ukraine. And this question was forwarded for 
voting. The amendment was not adopted by the majority of votes. 
This means that everything remains as it is provided by the law 
taken by the last Supreme Council.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vasyl Ivanov, people's deputy of Ukraine and </F>
member of the faction "Communists of Ukraine" by unidentified 
reporter; place and date not given: from the "Current Interview" 
feature] 
  [Text] VYBIR: How expedient is the election for heads of 
regional councils by the direct voting in regions? 
  V.I.: The matter is that a regional council will elect one 
head, and voters -- one more head, and I understand this is as 
unsatisfactory to us. There is something alike presidential 
emissaries in it. And it will cause unnecessary parallelism. We 
have already had it and the system has not proved to work. For 
strong power this power must be concentrated with one organ -- 
regional council. 
  We are worried that the heads of regional councils elected 
by 
the direct voting in regions may not volunteer to be subordinate 
to the Supreme Council. A deputy is elected in electoral 
district, and a head of regional council -- in the respective 
region, so the latter may claim to have more powers. 
  VYBIR: What is your forecast as to the elections for the 
president? 
  V.I.: We were against the post of President, but the 
election 
campaign is already going on, and we will support Oleksandr 
Moroz as we consider he has the best chances. Nowadays people 
understand that the life has become worse, that is why they hope 
for us -- communists and socialists. 
  VYBIR: Why was the President's proposal to postpone the 
elections rejected? 
  V.I.: To wait today with a hope that it will become better 
in 
future and connect it with the presidential elections is a 
mistake. Presently Kravchuk is trying to postpone the elections 
hoping that the popularity of the left-oriented forces will 
subside, and his chances will grow. 
  VYBIR: How necessary is it to limit the presidential powers? 
  V.I.: It is necessary to cut them down as much as possible. 
In general, presidential model hardly suits Ukraine. 
  VYBIR: Thank you.

  [Text] Vybir: What is your forecast as to the next 
President of Ukraine? 
  S.Kh.: I consider that Ivan Plyushch has the best chances 
from those candidates who are at the moment. He has some 
negative features, has made quite enough mistakes, but the one, 
who does not want to work, does not make mistakes. Plyushch 
thinks of the Ukraine's interests and he is the only real 
patriot of Ukraine from those who registered as candidates for 
presidency. 
  Vybir: If the parliament agrees to postpone the presidential 
elections, will it favour to Mr Kravchuk? 
  S.Kh.: Postponing the elections would do a favor to 
Kravchuk, 
and harm to Ukraine. Mr. Kravchuk will participate in the 26 
June elections not on his own will. He first of all wants to 
keep his post. He has not managed to rule the state efficiently, 
cannot guarantee the territorial integrity, he as the head of 
the executive power in fact does not exercise this right in 
Ukraine's favor. He would better ask for the resignation 
himself. But people like Kravchuk would not do it. One must be a 
person to do this. 
  Vybir: Does Mr. Kravchuk have chances to be re-elected to 
President? 
  S.Kh.: I hope this will not happen. I will not work in 
Kravchuk's favor saying that he might. If I do, it might give 
him support, no matter how small. 
  Vybir: From your speeches we can conclude that you are for 
elections of the heads of regional councils by the direct voting 
in regions. 
  S.Kh.: I consider that the heads of regional councils must 
be 
elected by the direct voting in regions, though it is clear that 
for our right bloc the results are not going to be consoling 
everywhere. But the communists are afraid of the direct 
elections for heads of regional councils. They are maximalists 
and understand that in the Eastern Ukraine they are going to 
have the communist majority among the heads of regional 
councils. Results of the direct voting may bring alternative. 
  Vybir: Are not you afraid of "Meshkov-ization" of Ukraine?" 
There might appear 26 "mini-Meshkov-s"... 
  S.Kh.: "Meshkov-ization of Ukraine comes from 
"Kravchuk-ization." Lack of activities and power in the central 
power bodies cause separatism in Ukraine's outlying districts. 
From the other hand, it is possible to introduce the provision 
to the law that the parliament can fire a head of regional 
council on the application of the Supreme Court, if he causes 
damage to the country or violates the Constitution. 
  Vybir: But if you win in the question of the elections by 
the 
direct voting in regions, and the left-oriented forces having 
the majority in the parliament, limit the powers of the central 
presidential power, is it possible the situation of all powers 
be concentrated with local councils? 
  S.Kh.: The left-oriented forces have the majority, but it is 
not a constitution majority. In order to limit the presidential 
powers, it is necessary to have 300 votes "for," and this is not 
real. 
  Vybir: Thank you.

  [Text] Kiev -- A greater council of the People's Movement 
of Ukraine [Rukh] took place on 4 June. The council determined 
the position of the Rukh at the coming presidential elections. 
The resolution particularly notes that the current political 
situation in Ukraine is characterized by an intensification of 
the offensive by antistatehood, pro-Communist forces. 
Therefore, the results of the election of the president of 
Ukraine will to a considerable extent affect the fate of the 
Ukrainian state. The greater council also noted that the main 
threat to the country's future comes from Oleksandr Moroz and 
Leonid Kuchma, who heads the pro-Russian, pro-imperialist 
forces. It was decided to support one of the candidates in the 
presidential election who stands for statehood positions.

<F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM correspondents Viktor Demydenko and </F>
Mykhaylo Melnyk on press conference by Chairman of Ukraine's 
Supreme Council Oleksandr Moroz on 30 May; place not given: "I 
Am Not a Hostage to Any Specific Political Forces in the 
Parliament"] 
  [Text] "I am not a hostage to any specific political 
forces in the parliament." The chairman of Ukraine's Supreme 
Council stated this on 30 May at the news conference when he 
characterized the present composition of the parliament. "I 
know that it will not be easy for me, but my election to the 
post is an optimal variant in the given situation," Oleksandr 
Moroz pointed out. 
  He said that the Supreme Council intends to prepare a 
package 
of radical measures aimed at stabilizing the economy. In his 
opinion, "Ukraine must, in the near future, resolve the question 
of currency regulation, remove other money from circulation 
inside the state, and revise the taxation policy as well as the 
utilization of credit resources." He also pointed out that "for 
many people, these measures do not seem to be welcome, but there 
is no other way out, if we want to overcome the crisis." 
  According to him, the restructuring of the economy "must be 
started from the military-industrial complex," and also "with an 
extensive integration with Russia." However, Oleksandr Moroz is 
categorically opposed to Ukraine's joining the ruble zone. 
  Touching upon the issue of the state's nonnuclear status, 
Oleksandr Moroz emphasized this: "The compensation for Ukraine 
for the withdrawal and destruction of nuclear weapons must not 
be looked upon as alms to a poor orphan, but must be the payment 
for the well-being of many countries of the world." That is why 
the chairman of the Supreme Council believes "assistance for 
Ukraine amounting to several hundred million dollars is 
humiliating for the state." 
  At the same time, the chairman of the Supreme Council is 
sure 
that the signing of the Trilateral Agreement could not be 
avoided, because "Ukraine is unable to maintain nuclear 
weapons." "If I had been president, I would have also signed 
the agreement," said Oleksandr Moroz, "but, perhaps, I would 
have also made those radical steps that would be more 
advantageous for Ukraine." 
  Answering the question on Western investments, the Supreme 
Council chairman said that "Ukraine is ready to accept them, and 
our reforms will promote the influx of foreign capital." "The 
essence of the reforms," he pointed out, "will be based upon 
market relations regulated by the state." 
  "No doubt," continued the head of the parliament, "many 
investors would like to know whether private ownership of land 
will be introduced in Ukraine." In his opinion, land must not 
become a subject of purchase or sale. It will be a crime 
against the people and the future generations.

morning he met workers of the Kharkov tractor plant. This 
enterprise, one of the largest in the machine-building complex, 
is under threat of stoppage. Managers of agricultural 
machine-building enterprises supplying the Kharkov tractor plant 
(?also) spoke at a consultation on ways for this and other such 
associations to get out of the crisis situation and ways of 
ensuring their uninterrupted and efficient work. Ukraine's 
president will visit Zmiyev this afternoon. A meeting at a

<F P=106> [Article by Olha Len: "The Corner Created by the Power"; </F>
from the "Observer" feature] 
  [Text] The Ukrainian economy looks more and more like a 
corpse. Compared with the first quarter of last year, 
production dropped 38 percent, and in some industries even 45-59 
percent. The production of consumer products shrank 39 percent; 
food -- 28.7 percent; nonfood products -- 45.1 percent. The 
production of light industry goods and domestic appliances 
declined by more than half, resulting in a one-third decrease in 
all kinds of transportation. 
  Against the backdrop of general economic collapse and 
chronic 
delays in payments of salaries, the 5-percent drop of inflation, 
touted by the Zvyahilskyy government as a sign of economic 
recovery, looks more like the gradual stiffening of a dead body. 
Apparently, the overheated body of the economy was treated to 
blood-letting until all the blood drained out. However, ranking 
officials insist that since harsh credit policies applied to 
state-run enterprises almost stopped the growing prices and 
fixed the karbovanets exchange rate, the credits should be kept 
back even further. 
  Ukrainian inflation has one nasty feature -- it is largely 
caused by excessive spending by the state, primarily, to keep 
afloat state enterprises, most of which have been operating from 
one government's credit to another for two years now. Since 
they pay salaries and for raw materials with borrowed money, and 
not from their profits, they would be paralyzed if left without 
regular state support. Step by step, those credits build up to 
form a huge state debt. State revenues from taxes, customs 
duties, and exports are catastrophically insufficient for 
everyone willing to receive cheap credit or subsidy. This is 
when the frenetic printing of new money is initiated, which is 
nicely called emission. What happens after the emission is 
nicely called inflation. 
  So it does not come as a surprise that after the Ukrainian 
Government and National Bank stemmed the outpouring of credits, 
inflation actually decreased. But this also stopped state 
enterprises and dramatically reduced production. This is why in 
spite of the government's decisive "stop," life inevitably 
demands "more" -- workers want their salaries, and enterprises 
their credits. Many workers were left without means of 
subsistence and the hope to earn it somewhere. 
  The government makes the situation even worse, stepping up 
repressions against the private sector. Commercial structures 
groan under excessive taxes and the self-will of state 
bureaucrats. Finally, they start to work illegally, that is, to 
move their operations into the underground economy. Favorable 
conditions for the private economic sector would relieve the 
burden of inflation even under the present conditions in 
Ukraine. Of course, unprofitable state enterprises will be 
forced to shut down in any case, but they could be replaced 
instead by alternative structures which would create more jobs 
and production. 
  However, the authorities did their best to encourage the 
unemployed workers to seek protection from unemployment in 
racketeering and petty speculation. After the recent "victory 
over inflation," the ranks of the underground economy will 
certainly be swollen by a cheap labor force, while people's 
standards of living will plummet.

  [Text] Kiev, 6 Jun -- "The most dangerous thing now is to 
begin to demolish everything and then to rebuild it yet again, 
especially at a time when the national economy is in decline, 
Anatoliy Holubchenko, Ukraine's minister of industry, believes. 
There is a crisis both in the economy and in the structures of 
power. Therefore, I fully share the concern of the parliament 
chairman and his wish to form the Cabinet of Ministers quickly. 
But we need to take measures urgently to stabilize the work of 
the national economy complex." The new government, in Mr. 
Holubchenko's opinion, will have to immediately take 
untraditional steps, in the first place to adopt a series of 
decisions on reorganizing production, and not allow 99 percent 
of enterprises to stop. "The current campaign against inflation, 
Anatoliy Holubchenko believes, has practically led to the 
paralysis of enterprises."

<F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Valentyn </F>
Landyk by UKRINFORM correspondent Volodymyr Yeremenko; place and 
date not given: "The Cabinet of Ministers Knows How To Extricate 
Ukraine From the Crisis"] 
  [Text] It appears that the government of Ukraine has 
finally found that the main link, more specifically, the several 
links, that may be pulled to draw the whole chain -- to 
stabilize Ukraine's economy. This enabled Vice Prime Minister 
Valentyn Landyk to state, in an exclusive interview with a 
UKRINFORM correspondent, that the situation in the country will 
change radically in the next year or two owing to the extensive 
work on restructuring the economy. 
  The adoption by Ukraine's Cabinet of Ministers at the 
beginning of May of the decree "On Urgent Measures for 
Overcoming the Payments Crisis and Normalizing the Work of 
Enterprises" was the first step on that road. 
  [Landyk] We must clearly specify what is meant. Today, the 
mutual insolvency of enterprises in Ukraine has reached 60 
trillion karbovantsi [K]. The same situation also prevails in 
Russia. Payments are not transferred either there or to us. 
Production has been stopped again. All this time, a specific 
experiment was conducted: Every time a certain sum of money was 
injected, in other words, [monetary] emission was resorted to, 
the enterprises worked for two, three, or four months and... 
stopped again. 
  [Yeremenko] In other words, they simply worked to fill 
warehouses and produced and stored products that nobody needed, 
and that was the end of it? 
  [Landyk] Precisely. That is why, at the end of December and 
in January, we were faced with a dilemma: Whether to administer 
yet another monetary injection and raise prices by between three 
and five times or stop everything and say: "Well, enough is 
enough, let us address the problem in terms of the economy." 
  [Yeremenko] However, how, being totally insolvent, can one 
extricate oneself from the standstill? 
  [Landyk] There are two ways. Either monetary emission, 
which does not suit us, or an economic stimulation of 
production. We have analyzed the lists of all enterprises in 
order to see which of them (a) need to be taken under control, 
(b) whose products are in demand, and (c) only work to fill 
warehouses. The picture is appalling: Today, in Ukraine, the 
products of just 30 percent of enterprises are in demand. That 
is why the task is to assist those enterprises that manufacture 
competitive products. 
  [Yeremenko] And close down the rest and throw the people 
into the street? 
  [Landyk] No, it is also necessary to help them, but in the 
following way: To completely reprofile them and to change their 
production. Today, it is necessary to adopt a clear-cut system: 
At the beginning or at the end of the year, the marketing 
departments must travel through Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, 
Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Poland, and Hungary and present their 
products, advertise them, and conclude contracts. Following 
that, all efforts must be focused on manufacturing those 
products for which there are contracts. Unless we realize this, 
we will not be able to get things going. In this connection, I 
believe that about 50 percent of directors need to be replaced. 
  Nobody speaks of "creating" unemployment and throwing 
everybody into the street. This is incorrect and not normal. 
We must try and keep all those enterprises that are needed for 
the functioning of the economy of the sovereign Ukraine. Even 
if, for example, 1,000 people work there, it is necessary to 
have them employed. Once there is work, wages, and deductions 
to the budget, the social sphere will function. There will be 
economic turnover. We envisaged this in our program. It is 
also necessary to prepare documents, so that, starting from tiny 
steps, we could gradually raise the economy. 
  [Yeremenko] How and on what principles? For example, there 
has long been talk that profits and not incomes need to be 
taxed. This is what is done everywhere in the world. 
  [Landyk] That profit must be taxed is not subject to any 
doubt. Drafts of corresponding decrees will be submitted to the 
Supreme Council for consideration in the very near future. 
  It is necessary to reduce the value-added tax, which 
presently constitutes 28 percent. I think that 20 percent will 
do. Moreover, we must look into the future, since there are 
different enterprises: For some of them, 20 percent may be 
assigned, whereas for others, 10 percent will be more than 
enough. In other words, there must be a differential approach. 
It is essential that people should be able to buy goods. 
Especially consumer goods. In some places, the excise duty 
needs to be reduced. Taxes should not render production 
inexpedient. Some people claim that the cancellation of taxes 
or excise duty will lead to a decrease of contributions to the 
budget. However, this is not so. If goods are selling, the 
state will also benefit from this. If there is stagnation, then 
there will be no value-added tax, sales tax, or excise duty. 
  [Yeremenko] Such a situation prevailed in the Zaporizhzhya 
production association Zaporizhzhya Automobile Plant. The prices 
of automobiles far exceeded K100 million. Mainly due to the 
exorbitant taxes, which rose above 65 percent of the automobile 
prices. As a consequence, nobody bought the cars and the 
warehouses became filled with automobiles. It was only after 
the administration managed to have the excise duty reduced and 
the prices lowered that the cars began to sell. Prior to that, 
the plant had stood idle for two weeks. Now, there is money, 
and production has been resumed. 
  [Landyk] Here, the general director of the Zaporizhzhya 
Automobile Plant, Stepan Kravchun, showed perseverance and an 
ability to convince. The Cabinet of Ministers decided to help. 
The machine builders benefited from that, as well as the 
country's economy in general. Over this period of time, more 
cars have been sold than in the preceding three and a half 
months. 
  Proceeding from the same circumstances, we decided to reduce 
the rates of the excise duty, in particular, on vodka, to 80 
percent, various types of wine to 10 percent, cigarettes to 40 
percent, color television sets to 10 percent, and to cancel the 
excise duty on black-and-white television sets and unprocessed 
alcohol. It is perfectly obvious that the state must hold the 
monopoly on the manufacture and sale of wine, vodka, and 
cigarettes. This is what is done in the majority of countries 
of the world, including highly developed ones, and this brings 
them large profits. 
  [Yeremenko] All the more so since, even before, such a 
monopoly used to be one of the main sources of profit in our 
country. 
  [Landyk] Yes, but then some people started hollering: This 
is illegal and contrary to market principles, let us open 
everything and import everything. It is not a matter of this 
being in line with the market or against the market. One must 
also know what the market is all about. The state, which 
manufactures alcohol that used to satisfy the needs of the 
entire Soviet Union in this sphere, must now import alcohol and 
not protect the interests of its own producers. 
  However, the problem does not only lie in such a monopoly 
and 
not only in whether we should import or export alcohol, wine, or 
vodka. Our export-import policy is generally wrong and turned 
upside down. In addition to taxes on profits, the producer in 
Ukraine is so burdened by such obstacles created by licensing 
that he is actually rendered helpless. 
  With regard to exports, we also have everything clearly 
specified. First, we will lower the prime cost of the output, 
as also the rates of various taxes. At the same time, imports 
will be regulated. It is necessary to protect our own 
producers. In this manner, we will emerge from the crisis. 
This may be called nonmarket methods. However, today, we must 
try to rescue our producers in every possible way and to prevent 
mass unemployment. When we emerge from the crisis, we will see 
what to do next. We have clearly adopted a course toward 
liberalizing exports and regulating imports. However, this does 
not apply to the CIS states. 
  [Yeremenko] Incidentally, about the CIS. It looks like the 
Commonwealth countries fail to trigger this mechanism. In this 
country, debates are in progress on whether Ukraine should be a 
member of the CIS (Ukraine is one of its three founders) or 
whether it should abandon the Commonwealth. Nor is there a 
common attitude toward the fact that, after the dispute that 
lasted more than a year, Ukraine became an associated member of 
the CIS economic union. Many people express their fear that this 
may become a new channel for colonizing Ukraine and for 
enslaving it. 
  [Landyk] Before answering this question, I want to focus on 
the European Economic Union. Why are the highly developed 
European countries uniting? In order not to admit us to that 
market. Moreover, in order to win over the market of the former 
USSR by joint efforts. Nobody is afraid of anything there. 
Work on introducing the single monetary unit -- the ECU -- is 
under way. 
  That is why we must also unite in order to protect our own 
market. Here, I do not only see an economic union of the 
countries of the former Soviet Union, but also of Eastern 
European countries -- Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, 
Hungary, former Yugoslavia, and so on. It is our market, a 
market where our products may be in demand. We may sell our 
products in Russia and Russia in Ukraine. There is no other way. 
Our export potential is not that high and it mainly applies to 
raw materials. If we take our machinery, we do not, 
unfortunately, have much competitive equipment. 
  It is, therefore, meaningless to give up this market. It 
will be occupied by others. I believe that Ukraine's joining 
the economic union of the CIS countries is an important step. 
It is shear nonsense to say that we may be drawn into 
something. There is no bondage of any kind. Frankly speaking, 
an associated member is in an even more advantageous situation 
that an effective one, as we have the right of choice, after 
all: We may or we may not take part in implementing a 
particular project. There is more freedom and room for 
maneuver. Besides, we will restore, stage by stage, 
technological ties and establish new ones. 
  [Yeremenko] So far, just the first step has been made. 
  [Landyk] It is also essential to elaborate an extremely 
complex mechanism and prepare a number of accords. We have 
already signed one -- on the creation of a free-trade zone. We 
are now discussing the need to proceed, stage by stage, to an 
economic and customs union. Altogether, 35 accords must be 
prepared. 
  One can say that integration is a trend prevailing in the 
world, and we must integrate at least within the framework of 
former structures, but on a qualitatively new principle, which 
will be mutual advantage and not mutual dependence. 
  [Yeremenko] All of these are global problems. What is being 
done specifically for every person and for every citizen of 
Ukraine? 
  [Landyk] First of all, it is planned to conduct indexation 
of minimal wages and provide purpose-oriented support for 
low-income families. It is envisaged that the state will pay 
for the increase in the number of working positions. It does 
not matter what form of ownership a particular enterprise has. 
If it functions and creates working places, it will also 
receive subsidies. This is the mechanism of state stimulation. 
Well, we are also coming closer to a monetary reform, which is 
inevitable. In the first stage, this is the ban on the 
circulation of foreign currencies in Ukraine already this year. 
In the second stage, the hryvnya will be introduced. 
  [Yeremenko] How much time will it take to implement the 
program? 
  [Landyk] Here is the forecast: If all of these decisions 
are fulfilled and if we establish new economic ties and maintain 
the already existing ones, it will take at least two years.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Pasyakin: "Who Will Become Chairman of </F>
the Sevastopol City Council?"] 
  [Text] Eleven candidates have registered in Sevastopol for 
the post of chairman of the City Council. They include Reserve 
Admiral Aleksey Kalinin, former commander of the Black Sea 
Fleet, Colonel Ivan Yermakov, former mayor of Sevastopol, 
Colonel Aleksey Melnikov, deputy head of Black Sea Fleet Air 
Force communications, and Rear Admiral Aleksandr Penkin, aide to 
the commander of the Black Sea Fleet for work with personnel. 
  This plethora of military candidates speaks for itself. 
Sevastopol is the Black Sea Fleet's main base. It is quite 
possible that a Black Sea Fleet serviceman will become head of 
the City Council.

  [Text] Kiev [no dateline as received] DPRK Foreign Minister 
Kim Yong-nam, currently in Ukraine on an official visit, met 
Ukraine Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko 6 June. The talks can 
be seen as introductory and consultative in nature. A wide 
range of issues were discussed in their talks. The key issue 
was focused on the development of bilateral relations, the 
possibility of economic cooperation, and the establishment of a 
legal and contractual basis for that. It was noted that Ukraine 
and the DPRK had signed only two agreements to date. 
  In addition, the two officials voiced their countries' 
positions on nuclear issues. Kim Yong-nam declared that the 
DPRK intended firmly to become a nuclear-free state. The DPRK's 
position on the matter coincides with Ukraine's, he stressed. 
  The sides plan to sign a number of bilateral agreements at 
the end of the visit 9 June.

  [Excerpts] Kiev -- Leonid Tupchiyenko, an expert at the 
International Institute of Global and Regional Security, 
considers that the next round of interstate talks between 
Ukraine and Russia on the Black Sea Fleet, to be held in Kiev on 
8-9 June, could end without a result since during the working 
consultations in Sevastopol at the end of last week, owing to 
Russia's position, the sides were unable to move forward on the 
most principled issue -- that of the division of the Black Sea 
Fleet's shore infrastructure. 
  Volodymyr Pryadko, chairman of Ukraine's State Property 
Fund, 
in an interview with UNIAN, declined to name the exact value of 
the property of the Black Sea Fleet's shore infrastructure. He 
just noted that "at issue is Ukraine property valued at several 
billion dollars." 
  In an interview with UNIAN after the completion of 
consultations, Feliks Gromov, commander of the Russian 
Federation's Navy, accused Ukraine of not wishing to include, 
first and foremost, the Massandra protocols and by doing so, 
casting doubt on the validity of the remaining documents with 
regard to the Black Sea Fleet. In the admiral's view, the 
absence of a clear political decision does not offer the 
opportunity to continue the dialogue with regard to the shore 
infrastructure. 
  Ukrainian Navy Commander Vice Admiral Volodymyr 
Bezkorovaynyy 
said: "There are at least 29 shore installations which should 
only be used jointly, because of their uniqueness. In my view, 
the Russian experts headed by Feliks Gromov were either not 
prepared or did not have the authority to discuss this issue 
during the meeting in Sevastopol as well as the aspects of the 
land basing of the fleet's aviation and shore troops." 
  During the consultations on 3-4 June they finally succeeded 
in confirming the agreement on the conditional 50-50 division of 
the fleet's ships. Its conditionality lies in the fact that 
Kiev selects 15-20 percent of the ships from its share which are 
realistically required to form the basis of the Ukrainian navy. 
  The members of the Russian delegation are interpreting this 
protocol of intent in the following manner: Ukraine has the 
right to select 15-20 percent from each ship type. The 
remainder of Ukraine's 35-30 percent will be compensated at the 
expense of inter- state economic agreements. 
  Ukrainian experts consider that Russia's position leaves 
Ukraine without the possibility of maneuver and therefore 
without the possibility of independently choosing the required 
number of ships within the limits of the 50 percent of the 
floating means owed to it. According to unofficial information, 
in practice, during the latest consultations it was not 
permitted to coordinate the division of 11 fighting ships. 
Ukraine Deputy Premier Valeriy Shmarov, who met experts from 
both sides, local authorities, and personnel of the Ukrainian 
naval command in Sevastopol, said in an interview with UNIAN: 
"A concrete approach to the division of ships according to the 
number and type gives the hope that this issue will be resolved 
soon." 
  Valeriy Shmarov, together with members of the governmental 
delegation that accompanied him in Sevastopol, examined, from a 
helicopter, the bays of Sevastopol and Balaklava and also 
Donuzlav which are increasingly being described as the probable 
main base for the Ukrainian navy. [passage omitted] 
  Independent experts note that Ukraine's desire to split the 
fleet in such a way that would enable both parts to cooperate 
operationally by defending the Black Sea basin and Ukraine's 
southern borders with Russia does not suit the Russian side. 
All efforts are being made in Moscow so that the fleet, after 
its division, remains a striking power in Russia's hands. 
Experts do not exclude the possibility that at the next round 
of talks in Kiev on 8 June, Russia's ambassador at large, Yuriy 
Dubinin, who heads the Russian delegation, will suggest 
preparing for the signing of two documents: a separate document 
on the ships and a separate one on the shore infrastructure. 
This will, in general, make reaching a principled decision on 
the division of the Black Sea Fleet in the near future a 
problem.

  [Text] The officers and warrant officers of the naval base 
at Donuzlava have sent an open letter to Admiral Feliks Gromov, 
commander of the Russian Navy. It says in part: "The hopes 
placed on the delegations of Russia and Ukraine on the question 
of the Black Sea Fleet division have not come true. The news of 
the supposed transfer of the Crimean naval base to Ukraine 
causes a well-founded anxiety and an uncertainty for the future. 
Should the Donuzlava base be turned over to the Ukrainian Navy, 
the naval base along with the settlement would fall into decay. 
The daily life of most people in the Donuzlava garrison is 
connected with work in military units. None of us can even 
admit the thought that the Crimean naval base will be turned 
over to Ukraine. Should this happen, the more than 7,000 
officers and warrant officers and members of their families 
would be left without subsistence. Comrade Admiral, we have 
faith in you, and in the common sense of the politicians who are 
not going to allow the transfer of the Crimean naval base to the 
Ukrainian Navy."

  [Text] Ukraine's foreign affairs ministry has received an 
oral message from Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. The 
message notes serious concern over the course of developments in 
Crimea. Ukraine's government knows that China maintains a 
consistent and clear stance with regard to our state's 
independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. This 
principled stance is outlined in the communique on the 
establishment of diplomatic relations between our countries, and 
in the Chinese-Ukrainian joint communique signed in 1992. 
During a discussion of Sevastopol's independence at a session 
of the UN Security Council last year, the Chinese side voted to 
support Ukraine's position on the basis of these principles. 
"China will always adhere to these principles in its relations 
with Ukraine," the message notes.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Dmitriy Gorokhov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 6 TASS -- All diplomatic instruments of 
the United Nations should be put to use to settle the situation 
in the Korean peninsula by political means and to keep from a 
rash resort to sanctions. This view was stated to ITAR-TASS on 
Monday by Professor Anatoliy Torkunov, one of leading Russian 
experts on Korea who heads the Moscow State Institute of 
International Relations. 
  Torkunov said demands of the international community to 
North 
Korea are fair. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
does not require of North Korea anything beyond what it expects 
from other countries. Russia fully shares this attitude to the 
nuclear problem which is the root-cause of the present Korean 
crisis. Russian approach was set out in detail during the 
negotiations Russian President Boris Yeltsin held with President 
of the Republic of Korea Kim Young-sam in Moscow the other day. 
  The Russian scientist warned against a rash recource to 
sanctions. Pyongyang got accustomed to relying on its own 
resources. Sanctions can only lead to the further spiral of 
ideological confrontation which, in the long run, will affect 
the position of ordinary Koreans. The further heightening of 
tension is fraught with unpredictable consequences as the Korean 
peninsula is inundated with arms in its both parts. 
  An international conference in the Korean peninsula 
suggested 
by Russia could be an effective way of easing the situation, 
Professor Torkunov believes. An ever greater interest is now 
shown in this idea as it essentially meets the interest of all 
the parties, including North Korea. The conference could put an 
end to the isolation of North Korea which has been increasing of 
late. South Korea has succeeded in establishing diplomatic 
relations with Russia, China and East european countries in the 
recent years. Meanwhile North Korea does not have diplomatic 
relations with the United States and others leading Western 
countries. If an international conference is held, Pyongyang 
could get real diplomatic levers to protect its own interests. 
North Korea should realise that the factor of menace to South 
Korea is no longer as important as it used to be. South Korea 
has a strong army, and Seoul interacts in defence matters with 
the United States on a basis on a treaty. 
  All the parties concerned should use every method of 
persuasion. China has levers of influence too. Beijing has 
traditional ramified ties with Pyongyang. Tokyo has levers of 
influence as trade with Japan is important for North Korea as an 
outlet to the Western world. 
  Russia must be flexible on this matter, Torkunov said. 
Russia has a certain stretch of common border with North Korea, 
and power politics in relations with neighbours can hardly be 
expedient. This is why the Russian line is to coordinate 
diplomatic efforts with other countries. Possibilities of a 
political settlement have not been exhausted, Torkunov said.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Nadein report: "Russia, the United States, and </F>
China Unanimous in Demands on North Korea"] 
  [Text] President Bill Clinton has said that the United 
States, Russia, and China are unanimous in the opinion that the 
armament of North Korea with nuclear missiles must be prevented 
and can unite the whole world community around themselves in 
imposing economic sanctions on Pyongyang. 
  This opinion was voiced in an interview which the U.S. 
President gave to Tom Brokaw, a leading NBC TV commentator, on 
board a U.S. warship off the Normandy coast. Clinton defended 
his administration's foreign policy, claiming that it takes a 
long time to elaborate a long-term foreign policy because the 
world situation since the end of the Cold War is not black and 
white and is completely unparalleled. 
  "The main thing is that we have not gone away, we have 
become 
involved (in maintaining international peace)," the president 
said, speaking about the foreign policy strategy which will soon 
be presented to the public. 
  In Clinton's opinion, the DPRK has no grounds for 
considering 
an economic blockade an act of war and will not take actions 
against South Korea or Japan. In reply to Tom Brokaw's question 
on whether the administration's indecision over Bosnia and Haiti 
will not have the effect of toughening Pyongyang's position, 
Clinton said that he believes that this will not happen because 
North Korea "will get a very clear signal" from the group of 
states interested in observing the principles of the 
nonproliferation of nuclear weapons.

<F P=106> [Sergey Postanogov report: "Tension on the Peninsula White </F>
Hot"] 
  [Text] While ROK President Kim Yong-sam was receiving the 
diploma and medal of honorary doctor of Moscow State University 
in Moscow, ministry leaders in Seoul were preparing for action 
in the emergency situation connected with the expected 
declaration of international sanctions against the DPRK. 
  The conflict flared up over Pyongyang's reluctance to 
renounce its nuclear ambitions and to satisfy the requirements 
of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] concerning 
inspection of a reactor producing plutonium suitable for the 
production of nuclear weapons. The U.S. Administration is 
holding intensive consultations with other states on this 
problem. "We are taking a firm line," Bill Clinton stated 
yesterday. "We are going to the UN Security Council with a 
draft resolution on sanctions." 
  In response to these statements the DPRK leadership has 
warned that any sanctions will be viewed as a "declaration of 
war." This is what has forced its southern neighbor to take 
"all measures necessary to give an immediate and decisive rebuff 
in the event of any agression from the North." Incidentally, 
U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry has stated that, if 
necessary, the United States would be prepared to strengthen the 
contingent of 38,000 troops already in South Korea. 
  The situation on the Korean peninsula has reached fever 
pitch. The United States, it would appear, is attempting to put 
together a coalition against the DPRK similar to the one that 
George Bush organized during the Gulf War. However, it is 
extremely doubtful that Clinton will manage to form a similar 
"alliance," and he would risk triggering a second Korean war, 
whose consequences would be catastrophic. 
  Moscow's stance in the current situation was spelled out in 
the proposal put forward by Russian Federation President Boris 
Yeltsin's suggestion that an international conference be called 
to search for mutually acceptable solutions to this conflict.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Nikolay Geronin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 3 TASS -- A meeting of South Korean 
President Kim Yong-sam with Russian and South Korean businessmen 
was held today at Moscow's Metropol Hotel to discuss ways to 
upgrade bilateral economic relations. 
  The meeting was attended by First Russian Vice-Premier Oleg 
Soskovets and vice-premier, Minister of Economy Aleksandr 
Shokhin, President of the Russian Union of Industrialists and 
Entrepreneurs Arkadiy Volskiy and President of the South Korean 
Daewoo concern Kim Woo Jung. 
  The South Korean president made a brief speech to urge a 
boost to bilateral economic cooperation. 
  The head of the Daewoo concern told ITAR-TASS that bilateral 
economic cooperation is promising. At the same time, there are 
certain obstacles on the way of more active South Korean 
businesses in Russia, including the absence of a clear legal 
basis for activities of foreign companies in Russia. 
  The imperfect Russian legislation slows down the 
participation of foreign firms in development of Russian 
economy, President of the Russian Union of Industrialists and 
Entrepreneurs Volskiy told ITAR- TASS. 
  Other Commonwealth republics have adopted laws on protection 
of foreign investments from political risks and guarantees of 
the right to export revenues. That is why, some foreign 
companies leave Russia for Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. For 
instance, the Daewoo concern has started to build a car plant in 
the Uzbek city of Namangan with an overall production capacity 
of 200,000 cars and vans a year. 
  At the same time, there are possibilities to boost 
Russian-South Korean economic relations, said Volskiy. There 
are plenty of South Korean proposals to participate in 
corporatization of Russian plants. A gas pipeline from Yakutia 
to South Korea is being discussed. The Daewoo concern and the 
St. Petersburg Pozitron plant have signed an agreement on 
production of video cassette players.

  [Summary] Moscow, 4 Jun -- At the end of his official visit 
to Russia, Republic of Korea President Kim Yong-sam had a 
meeting this morning with Yevgeniy Primakov, head of the Russian 
Foreign Intelligence Service (FIS). The ITAR-TASS correspondent 
learned from reliable sources that they met one-to-one. Yuriy 
Kobaladze, head of the FIS press service, declined to reveal any 
details of the meeting. 
  A top-ranking FIS official told the ITAR-TASS correspondent 
that one should not look for any hidden agenda in the meeting. 
Primakov and Kim first met in 1989, when the former was the 
head of the foreign relations institute and the latter the head 
of an opposition party. They have been on good terms ever 
since, and have often discussed bilateral and international 
issues of mutual interest, including nonproliferation of nuclear 
weapons.

  [Text] Moscow June 4 TASS -- South Korean President Kim 
Young- sam has received ITAR-TASS General Director Vitaliy 
Ignatenko for an unofficial meeting to discuss aspects of and 
prospects for Russian- South Korean interaction in information, 
publishing and humanitarian spheres. 
  When heading the NOVOYE VREMYA journal, Vitaliy Ignatenko 
was 
a first Russian correspondent to keep contact with South Korean 
opposition leader Kim Young-sam and used the journal to call for 
the establishment of Russian-South Korean diplomatic relations. 
  ITAR-TASS sent its correspondent to Seoul before the 
official 
Russian recognition of South Korea, and he is still the only 
Russian newsman in South Korea, a most dynamically developing 
state of the Asia-Pacific region.

  [Text] Khabarovsk, 7 Jun--Today, on his way back to his 
motherland, Republic of Korea President Kim Yong-sam made a 
short stop in Khabarovsk. An honor guard was formed at the 
airport. At the steps to the "Boeing 747", the high-ranking 
guest was met by Viktor Ishayev, head of the Khabarovsk Kray 
administration, and other officials. A half-hour conversation 
took place between the kray's governor and the president of 
South Korea. Viktor Ishayev reported that an exchange of 
opinions had taken place on a number of problems relating to 
mutual relations between the Republic of Korea and the Far 
Eastern region. In particular, the issue of setting up a free 
economic zone and ways of further activating economic 
cooperation were examined. More than 30 joint Russian-Korean 
enterprises are currently operating in the kray, the leading 
South Korean firms "Samsung", "Goldstar", and others are 
represented. The president of South Korea guaranteed assistance 
in implementing a large-scale project to produce buses in the 
Amur region with the participation of the Korean side. 
  After an hour-long stay in Khabarovsk, the president of 
South 
Korea left by air for Vladivostok.

  [Text] Vladivostok, 7 Jun--Completing an official visit to 
Russia, Republic of Korea President Kim Yong-sam arrived in 
Vladivostok today in transit. 
  Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, head of the Maritime Territory 
administration, held a ceremonial reception on the occasion. "Of 
all the regions of Russia, the Far East has one very important 
advantage: Geographically, it is part of the Asian Pacific 
region," the governor stressed in his speech at the ceremonial 
reception. "The enormous natural wealth of the territory, 
combined with the lengthy experience of development in market 
economy conditions accumulated by South Korea, create a 
favorable medium for the implementation of mutually beneficial 
projects." 
  In a reply speech, the Korean president noted that, "on the 
threshold of `the Pacific era', the Maritime Territory is 
becoming a genuine center of Korean-Russian cooperation. 
Effective joint activity is already under way--first and 
foremost in the field of fishing. Cooperation is being 
developed in other spheres as well. In particular, the Nakhodka 
industrial and technical park is being set up for Korean 
enterprises. A sea route linking Pusan and the Maritime 
Territory has been opened. Regular flights will start between 
Vladivostok and Seoul this year." 
  "Thus," Kim Yong-sam also noted, "it will be possible to fly 
from the Republic of Korea to Russia in just two hours, and this 
means that we will become closer neighbors." 
  In the afternoon, the president of South Korea and the 
officials accompanying him will visit the headquarters and one 
of the ships of the Pacific Fleet.

  [Text] Moscow, June 3 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and Russia on 
Friday [3 June] afternoon agreed to expedite the transfer of 
Russia's high-tech expertise to South Korea in the areas of 
aeronautical materials, airplane engine and energy. 
  At the fourth joint Korea-Russia science and technology 
committee meeting, the two countries decided to establish 
research centers of the three areas in Moscow with the 
participation of research institutes and industries of the two 
countries. 
  South Korea was represented at the meeting by Science and 
Technology Minister Kim Si-chung who was accompanying President 
Kim Yong-sam to the Moscow visit, and Russia by Science and 
Technology Policy Minister Boris Saltykov. 
  The joint institutes the two ministers agreed on are a 
Korea-Russia aeronautical materials research center, a 
Korea-Russia airplane engine research center and a Korea-Russia 
energy research center. 
  The idea of the two ministers is that the two countries 
jointly develop new technology in Moscow through these research 
centers and that Russia would accelerate the transfer of 
high-tech expertise it possesses to South Korea.

  [Text] Russia is prepared to increase supplies of 
low-enriched uranium to South Korea from the present 40 tonnes 
to 100 tonnes per year, Russian First Vice-Premier Oleg 
Soskovets said at a meeting with that country's Minister for 
Trade, Industry and Energy Kim Chol-Su in Moscow Friday. 
  To quote Soskovets, Russia was ready to increase coal 
supplies to South Korea from 400,000 to 1.5-2 million tonnes. 
Moscow, he said, was willing to form a joint venture with South 
Korea in the Neryungri coal field in Yakutia and grant the 
Korean side the right of ownership of a section of that deposit. 
  Soskovets said South Korea was making "only negligible" 
investments in Russian industry (a mere 27 million US dollars 
last year). 
  Soskovets stressed that Russia was a dependable partner and 
Korean private companies which invested in Russian industry 
would receive dividends.

  [Text] Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk June 7 TASS -- Japanese fishermen 
again violated the Russian sea border in the South Kurils zone 
on Tuesday morning. A Japanese fishing craft, sailing from 
Hokkaido, entered the Russian territorial waters near the island 
of Kunashir. A Russian patrol boat rushed to intercept it in 
spite of the heavy mist. The Japanese vessel was able to escape 
from the Russian territorial waters and no warning shots were 
fired as it happened on the night of June 3-4 when another 
Japanese boat intruded into the Russian territorial waters in 
the Kunashir Strait. 
  The situation on the Russo-Japanese border in the south 
Kurils zone grew particularly strained this month. Poachers, 
who had made a living for many long years by unlawfully fishing 
within the Russian economic zone and in Russian territorial 
waters, became particularly active since the beginning of this 
summer fishing season. It is believed that most of the poachers 
can hardly be expected to switch over to much safer legal 
sources of income. However, Tokyo has bluntly rejected the 
proposal made by Nikolay Pokidin, mayor of the south Kurils 
district, to legalise the "raids" of fishermen from the 
neighbouring Japanese island into the south Kurils zone by 
concluding regional agreements. 
  Russian borderguards believe that the coming summer will be 
particularly tense. Chief of the south Kurils borderguard 
detachment Lieutenant-Colonel Oleg Petrov told ITAR-TASS that 
some violators had been most impudent, as, for instance, on the 
night of June 3-4. As a matter of fact, the legal norms now in 
force allowed the Russian borderguards in that case to open 
effective fire. Petrov noted that the Kurils borderguards had 
always behaved and would go on behaving in strict accordance 
with the federal law on the state border of the Russian 
Federation, but their humaneness will not be endless. 
  Local analysts do not rule out the possibility of additional 
forces being moved to the south Kurils area if the situation 
grew worse, particularly from the fleet of the "Putina-94" 
operation, a large-scale action to protect the biological 
resources of the Russian Far Eastern seas, which began on April 
20.

Velichko] 
  [Text] Kuala Lumpur June 6 TASS -- Russian First Vice-Prime 
Minister Oleg Soskovets arrived here today at the head of a 
Russian parliamentary delegation on a two-day visit. The chief 
event of the visit will be the signing of a contract under which 
Russia will supply "MiG-29" fighter aircraft to Malaysia. 
  The signing ceremony for the contract is scheduled to be 
held 
on Tuesday. Oleg Soskovets will also meet with Malaysian Prime 
Minister Mahathir Mohamad and Deputy Prime Minister Anwar 
Ibrahim on Tuesday. 
  Acting Foreign Minister Abu Hassan Omar, who received the 
Russian delegation at the airport, told ITAR-TASS in an 
interview that the Malaysian side sees the contract as one link 
in a chain of broader cooperation with Russia in different 
spheres, including the military one. According to the minister, 
the "MiG" contract will act as a catalyst in the development of 
Malaysian-Russian-business ties. 
  Stanislav Filin, deputy director-general of the state-owned 
arms and military equipment export-import company 
"Rosvooruzheniye", told ITAR-TASS that the work on the contract 
had taken two years. The deal is worth 550 million U.S. 
dollars. The first "MiG" will be delivered in April, 1995. The 
full consignment of 18 aircraft will be shipped to Malaysia 
within 11 months. In collaboration with Malaysia, Russia is 
expected to set up a technical centre for servicing the planes. 
The contract also provides for training Malaysian pilots in 
Russia. According to the contract, 25 per cent of the planes' 
cost will be paid with supplies of palm oil with the right of 
export to third countries. 
  Meeting Malaysia's wishes halfway, the Russian side has made 
changes in the fighters' instrument system. In particular, a 
navigation apparatus working on frequencies used in south-east 
Asia will be installed in the aircraft.

<F P=106> [Yuriy Nikolayev report: "MiG's Not Sold Instantly. It </F>
Took Us Over Two Years To Break Into Southeast Asian Arms 
Market"] 
  [Text] Malaysia could become the first Southeast Asian 
country to use Russian fighters. Namely, our MiG-29's. The 
negotiations with Malaysia regarding their purchase have been 
long-drawn-out -- more than two years -- and quite complex. The 
reform of the military-industrial complex, conversion, and the 
complex political events in the Russian Federation have had an 
impact. Speaking more bluntly, Russia was not seen as a 
reliable partner by businessmen in foreign countries. Judge for 
yourselves -- no sooner had Malaysia evinced a desire to buy 
aircraft than 50 Russian firms, state institutions, and even 
citizens started vying with each other to offer their services! 
  Moreover, a deal was concluded not only on aircraft, it was 
part of a large overall program of trade and economic ties and 
military-technical cooperation -- along with the delivery of 
military equipment it is planned to create a technical servicing 
center and a joint venture to manufacture spares and components, 
to transfer technology in the aircraft construction and other 
sectors, and to train Malaysian pilots. In the future this 
package of agreements will allow Malaysia to create its own 
aviation industry and, on the whole, it forms the basis for 
long-term cooperation between our countries. 
  The deal was also based on details such as Malaysia's desire 
to partly pay for the military equipment in palm oil. In short, 
Moscow considered the deal profitable, with Malaysia considering 
us a "partner to be trusted," and a delegation headed by Vice 
Premier Oleg Soskovets set off for Kuala Lumpur. According to 
certain information, the contract is valued at around $600 
million. 
  According to evidence from Malaysian representatives 
("Rosvooruzheniye" refused to quote any specific figures on the 
pretext of secrecy), 18 MiG-29's will be bought for use by 
Malaysia with its Air Force. 
  To this can be added the fact that India has finally decided 
to modernize the MiG-29 with Russian help. That, at least, was 
what M. Mallikarjun, minister of state for defense, stated. 
According to him, fitting this aircraft with state-of-the-art 
equipment will allow it once again to perform as a modern 
front-line fighter. Specialists believe that the aircraft's 
total combat potential will be increased more than sevenfold. 
Twenty-one aircraft will be modernized. The contract will be 
worth around $350 million. The Mikoyan Design Bureau won the 
refit tender against fierce competition from Western and Israeli 
firms. 
  Our producers are not entering the difficult world arms 
market for fun. Arms exports fell from $22.6 billion in 1987 to 
$2 billion in 1993. According to forecasts from our experts, 
the figure should reach $3.4 billion this year.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Leonid Kotov] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi June 3 TASS -- Russian Deputy Prime 
Minister Yuriy Yarov arrived here today at the head of a 
delegation. His visit is aimed at preparing documents to be 
signed during Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's 
official visit to Russia towards the end of June, and 
activization the work of the joint Russian- Indian trade, 
economic, scientific and technical cooperation commission. In 
his capacity as chairman of the Russian part of the commission, 
Yarov will hold working meetings with its co-chairman from the 
Indian side, Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherjee and talks with 
other members of the government of India. 
  "India is among those few states, relations with which have 
never undergone any cardinal changes and are not subject to any 
reassessment as a result of serious political and economic 
changes that took place in our country," Yuriy Yarov said in an 
interview with ITAR-TASS after his arrival in Delhi. "India has 
always been given top priority in Russia's foreign policy, which 
was emphasised by President Boris Yeltsin in his address to 
members of Indian Parliament during his visit to Delhi," he 
emphasised. 
  Yuriy Yarov had a working meeting with Indian Commerce 
Minister Pranab Mukherjee in the Hyderabad House in Delhi today. 
  In his opening speech, the Indian commerce minister 
emphasised that Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to India 
in January, 1993 was an important stage in the history of 
Russian-Indian relations. The visit helped resolve many 
important questions, including the payment of India's debt to 
Russia, and helped determine the further path of our cooperation 
in economic, trade and scientific spheres. Mukherjee expressed 
the hope that new avenues of cooperation between Russia and 
India will be opened in trade, economic and scientific spheres 
during Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's forthcoming 
visit to Moscow, and as a result of his talks with Russian 
leaders. 
  The chairman of the joint Russian-Indian commission, in 
particular, highly appreciated fruitful and mutually beneficial 
cooperation between Russia and India which is now embracing all 
spheres of economic activities. But due to a number of reasons 
the trade between Russia and India slumped, leading to a 
significant fall in turnover over the past few years, he said. 
  Mukherjee expressed confidence that Russian-Indian trade 
will 
soon be doubled from its current level of 25 billion rupees, and 
cooperation between the two countries will considerably increase 
thanks to economic reforms being carried out in Russia and 
India. The Indian minister recalled that an important role has 
to be played by representativies of Russian and Indian private 
sectors. Their activities will not only help considerably 
increase exports from India to Russia to clear India's debt to 
Russia, but will also help set up joint enterprises for selling 
goods to third countries. 
  The two co-chairmen discussed specific questions about 
expanding trade, activizing economic cooperation and using new 
forms of cooperation between business circles of the two 
countries. Both sides paid special attention to resolve the 
problem of avoiding double taxation in their bilateral trade, 
the question of increasing supplies of goods from India to clear 
its debt to Russia, the introduction of concessional import duty 
on Indian goods and setting up a Russian-Indian bank. 
  Today Yuriy Yarov also held talks with Indian Finance 
Minister Manmohan Singh and Minister of State for Steel Santosh 
Mohan Dev. 
  The Russian delegation will fly to Bangalore on Saturday to 
acquaint itself with the work of Indian aeronautics and space 
industry enterprises. Their programme also includes a visit to 
Bombay, the "trade capital of India", where Yuriy Yarov and 
officials accompanying him will see shipyards, and also be 
guests of scientists of the Bhabha atomic research centre.

  [Text] Beidaihe June 6 TASS -- Qingquandao is China's 
second largest port which is the world's number one in hauling 
energy resources. It provides a convenient bridge linking 
Russia's Far East with China's north-eastern and northern 
regions. 
  "We are interested in the development of trade, economic, 
scientific and technical ties with our Russian partners. 
Prospects are particularly good in the sphere of shipping and 
ship repairs," Qingquandao Mayor Cheng Lailee said in an 
exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS. The mayor is taking part in 
the work of the first Sino-Russian seminar-cum-fair in the 
resort Beidaihe on the coast of the Yellow Sea, three hundred 
kilometres from Beijing. 
  The seminar discusses everything that is of interest to 
Russia and Chinese merchants, aviation and metallurgy, 
car-building and mining, grain and vegetable oil, processing of 
raw materials, the chemical, light and textile industries. 
  The seminar-cum-fair was organised by the Russian-Chinese 
joint company Liangfa and the Russian LML Ltd. 
  The venue for the event was chosen to contribute to the 
success of the gathering. In the past Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai 
and other Chinese leaders used this retreat to hold conferences 
on home and foreign policy and escape the heatwave in Beijing. 
Patriarch of Chinese economic reforms Deng Xiaoping, chairman 
Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng also favour the place. 
  Incidentally, it was here that the great helmsman said after 
a regular swim in the sea that "one should never forget about 
the class struggle," the phrase which provided the theoretical 
basis for the subsequent cultural revolution. 
  Times have changed and there is nothing to remind people of 
the class struggle or its proponent Mao Zedong apart from his 
full- colour portraits displayed behind the windscreens of 
trucks, just as Stalin's portraits used to be displayed in 
Soviet Union. China now values those who can make money. 
  "Actual links between Qingquandao, which is pursuing a 
favourable trade, economic and investment policy, with Russia 
are just taking shape," Cheng Lailee said. The first 
Chinese-Russian joint venture has already been set up in the 
city. Qingquandao is a link between the outside world and 
China's Bohai economic region, which has long since maintained a 
favourable base for the development of mutually beneficial 
business links between China and Russia, which were discussed 
during the recent talks between the heads of the two governments 
Viktor Chernomyrdin and Li Peng. 
  The main objective of the seminar-cum-fair is to combine the 
efforts of businessmen from the two countries. The next such 
meeting "Beijing-Moscow: New Horizons" will be held in Hotel 
Cosmos in the Russian capital in August. 
  "The idea of regular practice-oriented seminars and fairs 
for 
representatives of the business communities of Russia and China 
originated when everybody understood that the immense potential 
of trade and economic relations of the Russian Federation and 
China remains largely untapped," said general director of the 
Lianfa Company Petr Gvaskov. "it could not be fully used for 
lack of sufficient information about new forms of cooperation, 
benefits available in China, forms of payment and their 
organisation in yuan," Gvaskov said. 
  For the first time in bilateral trade and economic practice 
the Chinese and Russian participants are provided with 
information on taxation procedures in China and Russia, visas 
and customs rules. In addition, Lianfa has published a 
collection of relevant official regulatory enactments of the 
Russian Federation. 
  The event has proved its commercial worth: on the first day 
of its work a contract worth 29 million dollars was signed for 
the lease of five Russian Tu-154M's for use by airlines in the 
provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan. 
  Beidaihe attracts Chinese and foreign tourists and business 
people not only by its wonderful beaches, cottages, greenery and 
Chinese cuisine but also by its medical facilities, including 
the centre of Xiguno-therapy, whose specialists cure diseases 
without medicines. The first villas were built here a hundred 
years ago under the Qin dynasty. By 1949 twenty foreign 
countries had built their summer houses in Beidaihe. 
  Beidaihe offers a wonderful chance of combining recreation 
and business to residents of the Urals, Siberia and the Far 
East, fishermen, gold miners and oilmen. The opening of a new 
airline linking Russia to the city of Shanghaiguan, which is 
located next to Beidaihe, will make such trips quite feasible 
very soon.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Spirin] </F>
  [Text] Beijing June 7 TASS -- Russia's main trade partner 
in China -- the province of Heilongjiang -- is reconsidering its 
foreign economic priorities and planning to switch over from 
Russia to the rapidly developing countries of Southeast Asia. 
  According to Heilongjiang Vice-Governor Wang Zhongzhang, 
quoted by the "HONGKONG CHINA NEWS AGENCY", the province is 
bound to revise its foreign economic strategy shortly with due 
account of "the new situation in the region". 
  The heavy industry of this northeastern province, which 
borders on the Russian Far East and the Russian maritime 
territory, was built up with Soviet assistance in the fifties. 
It now accounts for an important share of the country's heavy 
industry. This is why the province was traditionally linked by 
close economic ties with its northern neighbour. However, trade 
between Heilongjiang and Russia had dropped drastically in the 
first quarter of this year -- by almost 45 per cent. This is 
partially due to Moscow's decision to impose visa restrictions 
on the entry of Chinese into the Russian Federation and also due 
to the growth of customs duties. 
  Since Russia is short of convertible money, needed to trade 
with China, Wang Zhongzhang said, Beijing has already taken 
measures to limit the import of Russian raw materials and 
semifinished goods, for instance, steel rolled stock. 
  As to Heilongjiang firms, which are in great straits due to 
the state sector's growing debt, they were recommended to seek 
"new external sources of financial revenues", primarily in 
Southeast Asian countries, where local Chinese businessmen have 
much weight. 
  The volume of Russo-Chinese trade amounted to approximately 
6.7 billion U.S. dollars in 1993 and Heilongjiang Province 
accounted for its lion's share. 
  It is not without reason that Moscow had always praised this 
Chinese province. Three of its high-ranking officials were 
decorated in 1992 with Russian "people's friendship" orders for 
their "large contribution to the development of Russo-Chinese 
friendship".

  [Text] Moscow, June 6 (TANJUG) -- Russian Deputy Foreign 
Minister Vitaliy Churkin returned to Moscow from Geneva on 
Monday. 
  Standing in for him at talks on peace for Bosnia on Monday 
will be ranking Foreign Ministry official Aleksey Nikiforov. 
  Nikiforov is Russia's representative to the international 
`contact group' for Bosnia, which comprises also the United 
States and the European Union. 
  The `contact group' insists that Bosnia's warring Moslems, 
Serbs and Croats end hostilities and seek solutions to their 
dispute through talks, which should pave the way for dividing 
Bosnia by giving 51 per cent of the territory to the Moslems and 
Croats for their federation and 49 per cent to the Serbs. 
  The `contact group' was due to meet with representatives of 
Bosnia's belligerents last weekend, but the meeting was not held. 
  Churkin was originally scheduled to brief the press at the 
Foreign Ministry in Moscow on Monday, but the briefing has been 
cancelled. 
  It is not certain when Churkin may meet the press because of 
a busy schedule, TANJUG learns at the Russian Foreign Ministry.

  [Text] Moscow June 6 TASS -- Relations between Cyprus and 
Russia were described as spiritual, as rooted in history, by 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and head of the Foreign 
Ministry of the Republic of Cyprus Alexandros Mikhailidhis at a 
news conference in Moscow on Monday following the negotiations 
between the two delegations. The foreign ministers pointed out 
the warmth of relations between the two countries. Mikhailidhis 
is on an official visit in Russia. 
  Kozyrev pointed out the importance of contacts with 
representatives of Cyprus, a Mediterranean country, where Russia 
has "economic and political interests". Russia is interested in 
an earlier settlement of the Cyprus problem on a basis of the 
United Nations resolutions with taking into account territorial 
integrity and sovereignty of Cyprus, Kozyrev said. He said that 
new approaches to the situation in Cyprus and in the region, 
especially after the recent report on Cyprus by U.N. 
Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali had been discussed during 
the negotiations. "We have coordinated plans for further steps 
with taking into account the role of Russia, permanent member of 
the U.N. Security Council", the Russian ministry said. There 
was also exchange of opinions on interaction of the two states 
in the framework of the Conference on Security and Cooperation 
in Europe and the United Nations where the stances of the 
parties coincide. Kozyrev noted that the visit by the Cyprus 
foreign minister will promote further development of economic, 
tourist and other ties which will help speed up the working out 
of an agreement of visa-free visits by citizens of the two 
countries. 
  In his turn Mikhailidhis pointed to an important stage of 
the 
settlement of the Cyprus problem that resulted from the 
occupation of the northern part of the insular state over 20 
years [ago]. He described the report by Butrus-Ghali as a 
manifestation of concern of the world community over the lack of 
progress in the Cyprus settlement because of the lack of 
political will of the Turkish side. He said the document is of 
huge importance for Cyprus as the 35-thousand strong Turkish 
military corps with heavy arms is still in the north of the 
island and 90 thousand Turkish settlers live there, which 
interferes with the demographic structure of the Cyprus 
population. "This is the essence of the Cyprus problem", he 
said. 
  "The dialogue with Russia will continue", Mikhailidhis said. 
"We rely on friendship with Russia, noting specifically Russia's 
important role as permanent member of the United Nations 
Security Council and the experience of Russian diplomats in the 
Cyprus problem. Cyprus strives for closer cooperation with 
Russia in every area, also through CSCE, the United Nations and 
soon, I believe, in the Council of Europe", Mikhailidhis said. 
  The ministers signed a protocol on mutual consultations 
between the foreign ministries of the two countries. The Cyprus 
minister meets on Monday with leaders of the State Duma and with 
Patriarch Aleksiy the Second of Moscow and All Russia.

  [Text] Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said that 
his country is coordinating its efforts with the Cyprus 
Government on possible new approaches in finding a solution to 
the Cyprus problem. Speaking after a meeting in Moscow with 
Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis, Kozyrev also said that the 
Russian Government wants a solution to be found for the Cyprus 
problem as soon as possible, based on UN decisions on the 
safeguarding of the Cyprus Republic's territorial integrity and 
unity. Kozyrev added that he has discussed with Mikhailidhis 
the possibility of new approaches to the Cyprus issue. In just 
a few words, he said, we coordinated our watches on how we 
should continue working on the issue by keeping in mind that 
Russia is a permanent member of the UN Security Council. 
  Foreign Minister Mikhailidhis said that the discussion he 
had 
with Kozyrev centered on the next steps that will follow on the 
Cyprus issue, after the UN secretary general's report to the 
Security Council. 
  Mikhailidhis continued his contacts and this afternoon met 
with the Russian Parliament President Ivan Rybkin. Later today, 
he will be received by Patriarch Aleksey.

  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin does not share the 
opinion that the absence of Russian representatives at the 
celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the allied landing in 
Normandy proves that the West still did not trust Russia. 
Yeltsin said this today after he had bought a book by well 
known Russian poet Alexander Pushkin in a bookshop in Tverskaya 
Street (to mark the 195th anniversary of Pushkin's birth). 
  Yeltsin repeated that on June 6 the celebrations in Normandy 
had just begun and each town in Normandy would celebrate the day 
of its own liberation from fascists. Yeltsin announced that the 
Russian delegation had been invited to one of the Normandy towns 
on June 28-29. 
  Yeltsin underlined that established tradition was also of 
importance. "When we were celebrating the fiftieth anniversary 
of the battles around Moscow and Stalingrad, etc., we did not 
invite any of our allies either. However, this does not stop us 
from being partners in all spheres, from trusting each other, 
respecting each other and resolving together international 
problems," Yeltsin emphasized. 
  Yeltsin confirmed his intention to meet Russian writer 
Alexander Solzhenitsyn. Currently, Solzhenitsyn is visiting the 
Russian Far East.

<F P=106> [Valeriy Rudnev report: "Joint Search For MIA's: Americans </F>
Obtain List of `Kozelsk Convoy', We Get `Klaus Dossier'"] 
  [Text] The latest, 10th, plenary session of the Russo-U.S. 
commission to trace U.S. MIA's has ended in Moscow. Assessing 
its results, Doctor of Historical Sciences General Dmitriy 
Volkogonov, the commission chairman, noted at the traditional 
news conference that their more than two years of work had been 
in the nature of a multilateral international humanitarian act. 
  The two-year investigation may not have brought any 
sensations, but it has nonetheless revealed many secrets. After 
World War II there were more than 20,000 U.S. citizens on Soviet 
territory who had been released from German imprisonment by 
Soviet troops. The overwhelming majority of them were 
repatriated. Several people died in transit camps and, 
admittedly, not all the graves have been located. The Americans 
are doggedly searching for them with our help. 
  Checks on one eyewitness led the commission members in a new 
direction. At issue is a camp for U.S. POW's built by the 
Japanese in the South Kuril Chain. According to locals, during 
World War II it held between 500 and 12,000 Americans. Neither 
the Russian nor the U.S. researchers as yet have any 
documentation to confirm this. But their joint expedition to 
Iturup Island revealed traces of a POW camp. Who was held there 
is a mystery. 
  Another "black spot" from World War II was the Tashkent camp 
for interned U.S. pilots. The researchers have no doubts about 
its existence. But not a single document about the camp has yet 
been found in a single Russian archive -- including Defense 
Ministry, state security, MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], 
and CPSU archives. 
  The search for documents about the Tashkent camp 
unexpectedly 
led researchers to the previously unknown episode of the 
transportation in the winter of 1941 of, according to archive 
materials, several dozen "British and French internees." Just 
who they were -- whether it was just British and French and what 
happened to them -- is as yet unknown. The commission members 
are concerned about the fact that the unknown convoy repeated 
the route taken by the Polish officer POW's (ending at the 
Kozelsk camp) who were shot in 1940. Once all the formalities 
in declassifying the list of the "Kozelsk convoy" have been 
carried out, it will be passed to the Americans. 
  The Russo-U.S. commission is interested in any information 
on 
an incident that took place over the Barents Sea 1 July 1960. 
Soviet fighters shot down a U.S. aircraft that had violated the 
state border. Two U.S. pilots survived and two died. The 
survivors and one dead body were handed over to the U.S. 
authorities. It is not known where the other American is buried 
-- his grave is being sought. 
  The Americans have been given documentary information on the 
areas where around 500 U.S. aircraft shot down by Soviet pilots 
or air defense troops came down. Records of the interrogations 
of more than 50 U.S. pilots involving the Soviet special 
services have also been passed on.... 
  The "Vietnam document" on 1,205 U.S. POW's originally 
obtained through Soviet foreign intelligence channels and handed 
over to the U.S. researchers last year continues to exercise 
public opinion. The commission members are disinclined to 
discuss whether the figures cited in it are realistic, but they 
are confident of the document's authenticity. 
  The plenary session of the commission naturally discussed 
Russian citizens missing abroad. According to Gen. Volkogonov's 
figures, there have been 106 local wars and armed conflicts 
since World War II. And at the will of the state Soviet 
citizens participated in almost every clash. The list of MIA's 
in these wars includes thousands of Russian names. 
  Clearly, the Americans had prepared carefully in advance of 
this discussion. Because the gift they presented to the Russian 
side was truly a gift from the gods -- the so-called "Klaus 
dossier," a document that had until recently been a complete 
secret not only to our researchers but to the Americans as well. 
It is claimed that U.S. State Department staffer Klaus was the 
only man privy to all the U.S. intelligence reports on conflicts 
involving Soviet citizens. Moreover, the "Klaus dossier" 
contained information from other confidential sources as well. 
Familiarization with this material may be the key to revealing 
what happened to thousands of our fellow countrymen lost without 
trace during various conflicts.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lilia Kuznetsova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 3 TASS -- The testimony of eyewitnesses 
and access to archive materials have thrown additional light on 
the fate of American servicemen reported missing during World 
War II on the territory of the Soviet Union, according to the 
members of the joint Russian-American commission. The 
commission, created to study the problem of American missing, 
held a press-conference on Friday to discuss the results of its 
latest plenary session. 
  Co-Chairman of the commission Dmitriy Volkogonov declared 
that the group's work has reached a new level and taken on an 
international character. The embassies of Great Britain, 
Australia, and Italy appealed to the commission today to help 
them learn more about their missing servicemen. Volkogonov said 
the group's work was "very important evidence of the improvement 
in relations between Russia and the USA." 
  Congressman Pete Peterson, co-chairman of the commission 
from 
the American side, noted that their work has been based 
exclusively on facts and personal testimony. The "cold war" 
group was able to uncover the remains of American pilot John 
Robertson Dunham, who was shot down over the Soviet Union in 
October 1952. New information about the pilots shot down in 
April 1950 and September 1952 has also been gathered. 
  The commission's sub-group for the Korean war has been able 
to get new information from Russian archives, and even the 
intelligence archives were opened up to shed more light on the 
Vietnam war. 
  The commission also noted that the American side has been 
able to provide the Russians some additional clues concerning 
Russian servicemen reported missing in Afghanistan.

<F P=106> [Anatoliy Shapovalov report: "You Don't Play With the Son </F>
of a Spy -- News About Ames, Whom Nobody Betrayed"] 
  [Excerpts] The jury has yet to pass its final verdict, but 
the case of 52-year old Aldrich Ames, the top CIA staffer 
accused of spying for the USSR and later Russia, seems to be 
quietly dying. And this applying of the brakes is no 
coincidence: The large-scale exposure of the Ames couple 
entailed a huge scandal in the United States over how, indeed, 
this was allowed to happen, and why it was overlooked. 
  Skillfully steering the course of events, the state has made 
a move which is not without interest. The intelligence services 
have been given the task of uncovering the exact extent of the 
damage done by the Ames. But even a battle waged by the most 
talented investigators will prove of no help if the main 
defendant does not want to "own up." [passage omitted] 
  While Ames and the jury think things over, the effects of 
the 
outburst of "spy fever" are starting to be felt in the United 
States, according to information from the serious newspaper THE 
WASHINGTON POST. Many CIA staffers feel that they are being 
subjected to a wage freeze and that rejections of promotion 
requests and threats of disciplinary financial penalties and 
enforced separations are becoming more frequent. Punitive 
measures are primarily affecting those intelligence staffers 
who, in the nature of their service, either directed or worked 
with Ames. 
  What is curious is that these investigations were triggered 
by a certain "former Communist Party official knowledgeable 
about the activities of Soviet intelligence." He proffered 
information to American counterintelligence bodies which 
narrowed the circle of the search and put them on the trail of 
A. Ames. 
  It is no secret that there is another version too: A. Ames 
was allegedly betrayed by a Russian Foreign Intelligence Service 
staffer. This information, to put it mildly, does not accord 
with reality, ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA's correspondent was told at the 
Russian Federation Foreign Intelligence Service Bureau for 
Public and Media Relations. This story was told in some form by 
one Lyubimov, former chief intelligence officer in Copenhagen, 
and nowadays it is periodically given play by the radio, 
television, and LITERATURNAYA GAZETA. 
  According to claims by THE WASHINGTON POST, a draft law is 
currently under preparation in Congress designed to improve the 
system for vetting staffers and safeguarding security in the 
CIA. In contains provisions which envisage setting up a national 
center for the purposes of the speedy and effective discovery of 
spies, and which endow the FBI with extensive powers concerning 
the counterintelligence security of the CIA, including in the 
sphere of vetting its staffers. Naturally, this is opposed 
vigorously by the intelligence department leadership, which is 
concerned about the deterioration of relations not only with the 
FBI, but also with the American legislators. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Following an exhibition of Russian technologies in 
the United States, the U.S. firm Douglas has concluded a 
contract with Yekaterinburg's "Novator" design bureau. The 
Urals firm has pledged to ship 2,000 rockets to the United 
States. 
  These rockets are not going to join the U.S. Army's arsenal 
but will indirectly help enhance its combat might. The thing is 
that specialists from Douglas intend to use the Russian rockets 
as targets when testing new arms.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Kurguzov] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia, 4 Jun -- Russia is to sell Brazil air 
defense missiles and launchers. Agreement on this was reached 
here during talks which ended on Friday between the leadership 
of the Ministry of the Army of this major Latin American country 
and representatives of the Rosvooruzheniye [Russian armaments] 
association. 
  In an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent, Col 
(?Cupertino), a spokesman of the Army Ministry, stated Russia 
will sell Brazil 112 Igla missiles used against helicopters and 
other low-flying targets and 56 missile launchers. To purchase 
this combat equipment Brazil's military chiefs have used part of 
the 100 million dollars allocated by the government for the 
modernization of the army. An ITAR-TASS correspondent received 
confirmation from a spokesman of the Russian Embassy in Brasilia 
that the deal had been concluded. 
  Col. (?Cupertino) stressed the deal was concluded as a 
result 
of the talks that were held in Moscow last September by Zenildo 
de Lucena, minister of the army, and the inter-governmental 
protocol of intent on trade and economic cooperation that was 
signed last December during the visit to Russia by Jose Andrade 
Vieira, then minister of industry, commerce and tourism. The 
protocol envisages, among other things, increasing the volume of 
Russian-Brazilian trade to four billion dollars in the next four 
years. The ministry spokesman said it was possible that other 
agreements in the military sphere would be reached in future and 
Brazil was interested in pursuing this. In connection with 
this, Gen. Gilberto Serra, head of the center for social 
relations of the Ministry of the Army, in an interview for the 
GLOBO newspaper said "Brazil is interested in buying from Russia 
as large a volume of armaments as possible at the least cost." 
At the present time Brazil is studying the possibility of 
organizing production of Igla type missiles in the country, he 
stressed.

  [Text] Russia's Deputy Defense Minister Colonel General 
Georgiy Kondratyev believes that the situation in the zone of 
the Georgian- Abkhazian conflict is explosive. "Although 
large-scale combat operations are hardly possible, armed clashes 
between various groupings may destabilize the situation," he 
told Interfax on Monday. 
  Kondratyev favors the earliest possible despatch of 
peacekeeping forces to this zone. He said, however, that the 
final decision is to be taken by the Russian president, who 
chairs the Council of the CIS Heads of State. 
  To quote Kondratyev, a peacekeeping operation might 
facilitate the return of refugees and a comprehensive settlement 
of the conflict. He also announced that the Russian 
peacekeeping contingent was ready to begin the operation three 
to five days after the decision was taken. 
  A total of 1,500 Russian peacekeepers, consisting of two 
divisions based in the Leningrad and Volga military districts, 
are expected to be sent to the conflict zone. Subsequently, 
peacekeepers from other CIS countries are to join the operation.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Kanat Saudabayev, who is on a visit 
to Moscow, met Oleg Soskovets, first deputy chairman of the 
Russian Government. They had a detailed and frank exchange of 
opinions on a wide range of problems of mutual interest. 
Special attention was focused on the necessity to increase 
integration processes both in political and economic spheres. 
Soskovets, in particular, stressed the importance of removing 
the tendency to politization of economy, which has manifested 
itself of late. The sides expressed their belief that it is 
urgent to invigorate work and implement the agreements reached 
during Nazarbayev's first ever official visit to Russia in late 
March. Big hopes to this effect are placed on the 
Kazakh-Russian intergovernmental commission. Concurrently, in 
the interests of overcoming the decline of production, both 
states should actively use possibilities connected with 
development of direct contacts between separate regions and 
enterprises, and encourage targeted investment in business.

  In spite of the upbeat assessments made at the press 
conference, Russian-Kazakhstan economic relations have two sore 
points. These are Baykonur and the development of the Caspian 
shelf. More broadly, this means the problem of oil deliveries 
from the Caspian region. 
  In the Russian-Kazakhstan litigation around Baykonur, a new 
party has emerged: the Lockheed Corporation. It is interested 
in the program of Russian commercial space launches. First, the 
corporation produces satellites that are launched. Second, 
under a contract with NASA, it is one of the main contractors 
for manufacturing the Alfa station, and this project is directly 
related to launches from Baykonur. Therefore, in its struggle 
for the cosmodrome, Russia can acquire a strong ally and, 
judging by information from confidential sources in the Russian 
Government, a joint team is being formed with Lockheed. 
  Whereas the situation around Baykonur has become rather 
commonplace, Moscow has not raised the issue of the Caspian 
until recently. On 2 June Grigoriy Karasin, chief of the 
Foreign Affairs Ministry Press and Information Service, stated 
that his department had presented the British embassy with an 
official note. It says that Russia deems invalid any agreements 
connected with developing mineral resources in the Caspian Sea 
basin that have not been approved by Russia and other countries 
of the basin. This rigid demand is substantiated by the sea's 
inland ecological regime. 
  Thereby Russia confirms its intention directly to 
participate 
in projects that are being implemented in Kazakhstan and 
Azerbaijan. The Kazakhstan projects are Tengiz and Kaspshelf, 
and in Azerbaijan there is a similar project to produce oil on 
the Azerbaijan shelf of the Caspian. The note was sent to Great 
Britain because a leading role in all the projects belongs to 
British Petroleum. 
  So far Russia, through Lukoil, directly participates in the 
Azerbaijan project. Lukoil holds 10 percent of the stock; 
Azerbaijan, 30 percent, and the rest is controlled by a 
consortium of Western firms. 
  Russia, jointly with Kazakhstan and Oman, participates in 
the 
Caspian pipeline consortium on a parity basis. 
  The best possible option for Russia would be transportation 
of Azerbaijan oil through the Caspian pipeline. On the other 
hand, Russia is ready to render Azerbaijan assistance in 
building oil pipelines through Turkey or Iran. In any event, 
Russia's share in the Azerbaijan project should increase. 
Russia's ultimate goal, diplomatically covered up by references 
to ecology, is apparently to preserve control of the oil export 
from this largest non-Russian oil producing region in the CIS. 
In all probability, this idea was also maintained by Fuel and 
Energy Minister Yuriy Shafranik at the 14th International Oil 
Congress in Norway. Russia has officially favored accession to 
the European Energy Charter. This idea has not been approved 
yet because the West is not ready to lift restrictions on 
Russian oil in Europe.

<F P=106> [Gennadiy Charodeyev report: "Moscow Disagrees With </F>
Partition of Caspian"] 
  [Text] Moscow regards as premature the conclusion of the 
Anglo-Azerbaijani memorandum on cooperation in prospecting for 
and extracting oil and gas in the so-called "Azerbaijani sector" 
of the Caspian, a high-ranking Russian Foreign Ministry 
spokesman told IZVESTIYA. 
  A note handed to the British ambassador in Moscow explains 
that there is no sectoral demarcation of the seabed in the 
Caspian. The Caspian is by its nature an enclosed body of water 
with a single ecological system and constitutes an object of 
joint use, within whose bounds all questions of activity, 
including the opening up, surveying, and utilization of 
resources, must be resolved with the participation of all the 
Caspian states (Russia, Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, and 
Turkmenia). Therefore, as the Russian note to her majesty's 
official representatives stated, any steps by any Caspian state 
aimed at securing advantages in respect of the area and 
resources of the Caspian run counter to the other Caspian 
states' interests and cannot, in this context, be recognized. 
  Russian experts in the sphere of international law of the 
sea 
have specified that the idea advanced by Iran of commencing 
talks among the littoral states on formulating common 
international legal principles of the joint use of the Caspian's 
natural riches has still not been realized. At the time the 
Iranians proposed setting up a special commission for this, 
which would include all the interested sides. Moscow supports 
this idea. But Baku is evidently in a hurry to play its 
"Caspian card" by announcing the unilateral introduction of a 
special "Azerbaijani sector" in the sea. At a recent meeting 
with representatives of the British Petroleum oil consortium, 
who are reckoning on concluding a profitable deal, President 
Geydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan, while supporting in principle the 
idea of working out the Caspian's international status, 
nevertheless declared: "May this question not trouble you. 
Nobody has the right to deprive Azerbaijan of its national 
riches." 
  London has taken cognizance of the information forwarded by 
the Russian side and promised to investigate.

<F P=106> [Nikolay Zhelyabov article in the "Opinion" column: </F>
"Karabakh: A Settlement, or Struggle for Influence? The 
Interests of Moscow and the West Have Clashed in the 
Transcaucasus"] 
  [Text] A lull in one of the most protracted conflicts on 
the territory of the former USSR -- Nagorno-Karabakh -- achieved 
again with Russia's mediation, allows the hope that this 
cease-fire could be final and that the sides will soon make a 
step toward a comprehensive settlement. However, even if Baku, 
Yerevan, and Stepanakert really, sooner or later, coordinate 
compromise solutions with all the parties involved, one problem 
will still remain: Will it also be possible to work out a 
general code of conduct for the intermediaries? In so far as 
Russia and the CSCE -- and in the final analysis, Russia and the 
United States -- seeking to make an impact on the course of this 
conflict, pursue not least their own regional interests, the 
parties to it, balancing on the "needle's point," are trying to 
play on their differences, turning them to their own advantage. 
  Thus, immediately after Russian Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev, at negotiations in Moscow, tried rather rigidly to 
condition the implementation of the first, military-technical, 
stage of the Russian peace plan by participation in it of 
Russian peacekeeping forces and possibly those from CIS or CSCE 
member states, U.S. Ambassador to Azerbaijan Richard Kozlaric 
made a statement: Any plan for resolving the Karabakh problem, 
including Russia's, should be implemented within the CSCE Minsk 
group while the introduction of CIS disengagement forces should 
proceed under the supervision of international observers. 
  The problem, however, is that over two years of its work the 
CSCE Minsk group has managed to coordinate a sole document: a 
mandate of CSCE observers -- but even then it has not yet been 
approved by the Committee of Conference Senior Officials. There 
is also a "CSCE Minsk group schedule," most of whose provisions, 
however, have been drafted in Moscow. It was openly rejected by 
Azerbaijan, and even though Karabakh accepted it, it did so only 
because the plan did not please Baku: for no other reason. The 
Minsk group has made no attempts to reanimate it. Meanwhile 
Russia, leaving the CSCE "to mark time," has again invigorated 
its own intermediary offices and proposed its own plan for a 
settlement which in any event is more concrete and balanced, and 
coordinated with the parties involved. 
  This course of events, however, could hardly satisfy those 
who pursue their own ambitions in the region. But whereas, say, 
Ankara has today found itself by the wayside of the settlement, 
the United States quite openly indicates that it does not intend 
to turn a blind eye to the activity of Russia which can enhance 
its influence in the Transcaucasus. U.S. diplomats, 
incidentally, exert fairly tangible pressure both on Baku and 
Yerevan, using in one instance the issue of political freedoms, 
and in the other, cuts in humanitarian supplies in order to 
minimize Russian influence. Observers link this pressure to a 
recent rise in opposition activity in Baku which sharply moved 
against the Russian plan being adopted. 
  There is a difference in approaches also within the Minsk 
group itself. The Swedes, who preside over it now, are ready to 
interact within the Russia-CSCE tandem, aware that without 
Russia the Minsk group will not be able to work. The United 
States, on the other hand, wants not simply to change the leader 
in this linkage but to isolate Russia's activity within the 
confines of the Minsk group. 
  Recently its chairman Jan Eliasson invited Armenia, 
Azerbaijan, and Karabakh to sign a document whereby the parties 
ask the CSCE to send its observers to the conflict region, 
including observers from the CIS and Russia. In the situation 
when Russia, implementing its plan, ensures a cease-fire and 
consolidates its own positions in the region, this document at 
the very least should raise the CSCE's authority. The 
Americans, however, would like the international observer 
headquarters to appear in the conflict zone before the arrival 
of Russian peacemakers. This could bring political dividends to 
the mission but, from the "material" perspective, 34 CSCE 
observers, the first ones, based in Agdam or Stepanakert, will 
not be working "in the field" and will not be able to maintain 
or carry out on-site inspection of the cease-fire. And even in 
two weeks, when another six observer groups appear, they will 
not be able to "cover" the entire control zone whereas under the 
Russian plan, within the first three days, 49 monitoring posts 
and mobile groups will be deployed, ensuring an effective 
cease-fire. Given that the financing of the Russian 
peacekeeping operation will in all likelihood be done at 
internal standards, the following comparison will be in place: 
in South Ossetia, where a similar operation is under way, the 
commander of the Russian contingent receives less in a month 
than CSCE mission members make in a day. 
  The maximalist position is that the CSCE, if it wishes to 
play a more active role in the settlement, should provide not 
only its "front" but also the requisite maintenance for it. And 
it has no intention to incur such expenditures. Therefore 
Russians, for their own beggarly compensation, will throw 
themselves "into the thick of it" while CSCE observers will 
arrive under more comfortable conditions and only if the 
situation is calm. 
  Meanwhile, Moscow allows that the signature by a CSCE 
representative may be put under the "big" political agreement 
proposed by the Russian intermediary. Even so the geopolitical 
game continues. The military-technical document drafted by 
Pavel Grachev's office has been signed, apart from him, by 
Armenia and Karabakh, with Azerbaijan taking a wait and see 
attitude. Azerbaijan agreed to put its signature under the 
"Eliasson document" and Armenia and Karabakh are still pondering.

<F P=106> [Vitaliy Denisov and Aleksandr Pelts report: "Deputies </F>
Refused To Send Peacemakers Immediately. However, Vice Premier 
Sergey Shakhray Believes This Is Essential"] 
  [Text] The Federation Council debate over the immediate 
introduction of Russian peacemaking forces into the 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone was pretty stormy. Even after 
deputies had been addressed by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister 
Boris Pastukhov, they were unable to adopt a decision and 
continued the discussion "behind closed doors." Ultimately the 
parliamentarians backed the viewpoint put forward by Petr 
Shirshov, chairman of the Federation Council Committee for 
Security and Defense Issues, who believes that the president's 
appeal for the immediate introduction of peacemakers into the 
conflict zone lacks an adequate legal base. Petr Shirshov said 
that the Federation Council does not have the requisite 
documents to enable it to approve the introduction of Russian 
peacemakers there. 
  Despite this, Russian servicemen's participation in settling 
the conflict is rather the question of the day. Russia has to 
send peacemakers into the conflict zone. That was the opinion 
voiced by Vice Premier Sergey Shakhray. He believes that lack 
of information, notably about the sources of funding for these 
forces, was the reason why the Federation Council deputies were 
unable to adopt a decision regarding the introduction of troops. 
"The executive and the legislature must work on this question 
together," Shakhray stressed during a conversation with a RIA 
correspondent. 
  The Georgian Defense Ministry press service reported that 
during the night of 2 June Abkhazian formations breached the 
cease-fire agreement by firing artillery shells at Georgian 
positions in the Dalskoye Gorge for 40 minutes. The Georgians 
refrained from retaliating. 
  Meanwhile, the Abkhazian Defense Ministry reported that for 
two days now Georgian formations have been methodically 
bombarding Abkhazian positions in the Kodor Gorge with all 
manner of automatic weapons. 
  It is worthy of note that mutual accusations are being 
exchanged ahead of the adoption of a definitive decision 
regarding the introduction of CIS peacemaking forces into the 
conflict zone. Experts and observers think that each side is 
thus trying to create a certain image that will enable it in the 
future to actively influence the essence and substance of the 
peacemaking mission in Abkhazia.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Akimov] </F>
  [Text] Alma Ata [Almaty] 6 June TASS -- Kazakh President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev has completed a draft document outlining 
the mechanism for establishing a Eurasian union, the KAZTAG news 
agency said on Monday [6 June]. 
  The full text of the document will be published in the local 
mass media on Tuesday. 
  The news agency said that the document does not bury the 
idea 
of the Commonwealth of Independent States and offers yet another 
scheme of integration which will function alongside the CIS. 
  The union is expected to bring together only those republics 
of the former Soviet Union which are ready for this kind of 
cooperation and integration. 
  The principles of and mechanism for establishing the union 
must be based on their results of "national referendums or 
parliamentary decisions on joining the Eurasian union" as well 
as "equality, non-interference in internal affairs of each 
other, territorial integrity and inviolability of state borders." 
  All this will "provide the legal and organisational 
framework 
for furthering integration in order to set up an economic, 
currency, and political union." 
  The draft does not provide for associative membership. 
Decisions will be considered adopted if they are supported by 
four-fifths of the total number of member countries. 
  The admission to the union is strictly conditioned. The 
terms include "strict observance of the signed inter-state 
agreements, mutual recognition of the existing political and 
state institutions in the union member states, recognition of 
territorial integrity and inviolability of borders, denunciation 
of economic, political and other pressure in inter-state 
relations, as well as cessation of fighting with each other." 
  For the union to function effectively, Nazarbayev suggests 
setting up a number of supranational bodies, including the 
council of heads of state and heads of government which will 
have the supreme authority. Each country will preside in the 
council for six months and will take turns in alphabetical order. 
  The union's parliament will be the highest consultative 
body. 
The council of foreign ministers will coordinate foreign 
policies of the member countries. 
  Nazarbayev believes that Russian should be made the official 
language of the union, which will be headquartered in a city 
lying on the border of Europe and Asia, for example Kazan or 
Samara. 
  The idea of a Eurasian union proposed by the Kazakh 
president 
is not the return to the past. It draws on the experience of 
the European Union, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries and other international alliances, which have proved 
viable. 
  This opinion featured prominently at a news conference in 
the 
Kazakh capital of Alma Ata on Monday. The participants in the 
press conference said that Nazarbayev's idea is often distorted 
by the mass media, which causes inadequate reaction from some 
political circles considering the union as the return to Soviet 
rule. 
  The idea is based on world experience, the existing economic 
ties between the CIS countries and the effective use of their 
economic potential, they said.

  [Text] Dear listeners, we now present a report on the 
latest situation in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] and the 
border between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 
  Although the mediation effort to find a peaceful solution to 
the NKR problem is being maintained, Azerbaijan's military 
forces have continued to fire on the Armenian positions at the 
NKR front lines with various types of arms every day. We 
already reported in our previous broadcasts that the Armenian 
side wishes to remain committed to the agreement that has been 
reached on a cease-fire. In fact, the Armenian defense units 
have not returned the fire and refrained from retaliating 
against provocative activities in Martuninskiy Rayon today. 
  Meanwhile, no incidents occurred on the border between 
Armenia and Azerbaijan during the past day. 
  Azerbaijan's military forces attacked an area on Armenia's 
border, which is only five km from Noyemberyan, the night before 
last. An enemy battalion, supported by armored vehicles, 
attacked the defense positions in the vicinity of [place name 
indistinct]. A wave of artillery shelling preceded the 
onslaught. The enemy units tried to approach the 
Noyemberyanskiy Rayon center. They managed to advance in a few 
areas. However, the Armenian border units repulsed their attack 
at 0300 the next day. Azerbaijan's units were forced to retreat 
after losing many men and military equipment. The Armenian side 
also suffered casualties. 
  The Azerbaijani mass media organs claimed several days ago 
that the Armenian military units penetrated up to five km into 
the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic. The objective behind the 
dissemination of such unfounded reports is to justify the 
Azerbaijani Military Headquarters' aggressive intentions. 
However, the enemy side must realize that it will not be able 
to achieve its objectives through aggression. Armenia's border 
guards are capable of appropriate retaliation against the enemy 
units. 
  Azerbaijan has been reluctant to relinquish its inauspicious 
intentions. Consequently, innocent people have been killed or 
wounded. How will the Azerbaijani Military Command Headquarters 
account to the families of the troops who have been killed in 
the latest clashes?

<F P=106> [Weekly interview with Georgian State Council Chairman </F>
Eduard Shevardnadze by correspondent Nato Oniani; place and date

  [Excerpts] Batono [honorific title] Eduard, last week the 
CIS executive secretary [Ivan Korotchenya] visited Tbilisi, and 
it was said that all the CIS republics have agreed in principle 
to the deployment of peacekeeping forces [in Abkhazia]. 
However, Russia's Federation Council rejected the idea. Also 
last week, you had a telephone conversation with President 
Yeltsin. Should we prepare for some unexpected developments as

  Another question. How would you comment on the following 
statement from [Russian State Duma] CIS Affairs Committee 
Chairman Zatulin: There is an alternative plan to the Russian 
initiative; it envisages the introduction to Abkhazia of troops 
of foreign states; if the Russian initiative fails, Russia will 
lose its reputation not only within the CIS but also in the 
entire world; as long as Russia is capable of carrying out 
peacekeeping operations, it will be a key factor in the world; 
the introduction of non-Russian forces to Georgia will result in 
Russia losing its influence. 
  [Shevardnadze] Thank you and good morning. The introduction 
of peacekeeping forces to Abkhazia has practically been decided. 
This was reaffirmed by Russian president Boris Yeltsin in a 
telephone conversation a couple of days ago. The details are 
being worked out now. Some aspects of this operation were 
discussed on television by Mr. Jaba Ioseliani [chief Georgian 
negotiator at the talks with Abkhazia] yesterday. He stressed 
some very important points. 
  Events will develop according to plan. At least, that is 
what Mr. Yeltsin confirmed during our conversation. A failure 
of this peace mission, if it happens, would seriously undermine 
the CIS's reputation as a major inter-regional organization. I 
think this would not be acceptable to any state, and, of course, 
this would be a serious blow to Russia. Peacekeeping, 
particularly in Abkhazia, is in Russian national interests. I 
am thinking here of the stability of the expanses of southern 
Russia. At the same time, this peace mission will reaffirm 
Russia's international standing. Therefore, while a successful 
completion of this mission is primarily in the interests of 
Georgians and the Abkhaz, and in the interests of the state of 
Georgia, at the same time it serves the interests of all CIS 
countries, and primarily of Russia. 
  I welcome Mr. Zatulin's comments, which are realistic and 
well- balanced. 
  [Oniani] The conflict in Abkhazia is only one of the 
conflicts which have developed on former Soviet territory and 
which were sparked off by aggressive separatism. These 
conflicts have long since become a regular matter and their 
number is, unfortunately, rather large. This has been for some 
time, and now a conflict has developed in Ukraine in connection 
with Crimea. 
  [Shevardnadze] I would say the following about this. Since 
the late 1980's, when the disintegration of the Soviet Union 
began, and especially in the 1990's, I have spoken publicly on 
more than one occasion about separatism and about the threat 
posed by aggressive separatism in post-communist times. One 
such example is my address to the UN General Assembly in 
September 1992. 
  Unfortunately, nothing was done in practice by either world 
or regional organizations to avert the threat of aggressive 
separatism or to create guarantees for a normal and peaceful 
life of the planet's citizens as the cold war was drawing to its 
historic end. The world has failed to recognize this threat and 
its scale. Those who did recognize it did little to carry out 
tangible measures. This is very unfortunate. Because of this, 
we are now dealing with unpleasant events in Europe and 
elsewhere which may turn into an even bigger threat in the 
future. 
  This general remark also applies to Crimea. I am sure that 
the Crimean problem will be solved within the framework of a 
single and indivisible state of Ukraine and with Russian 
assistance, which will have crucial importance. I want to 
stress that the Russian factor in settling the Crimean issue 
cannot be ignored. 
  Another point I would like to stress is that a confrontation 
between Russia and Ukraine cannot be allowed to happen. Such a 
confrontation would be a great disaster not only for the two 
great states, which are our friends, but also for other 
countries in Europe and Asia, including Georgia. Such a 
confrontation would inflict serious and irreparable damage on 
Georgia, the Caucasus in general, and the whole Black sea region. 
  [Oniani] Last week you hosted a meeting of representatives 
of law-enforcement bodies. After this meeting, the Interior 
Ministry carried out a major operation in Rustavi. Will such 
operations be carried out again in the future, and how 
successful do you think they are? 
  [Shevardnadze] We cannot be pleased with the present state 
of public order. However, we must remember what state our 
country was in a year ago, or even five or six months ago, and 
we should compare that with the present situation in the 
capital, in western Georgia, and in several other regions. 
  It is very important to recognize that there have been 
certain changes and that a tangible improvement has occurred, 
otherwise we will scare off our foreign partners who have a 
great desire to come to Georgia and work here, for example, in 
oil recovery, oil processing, gas recovery, and so on. We have 
created conditions for these people to come and work in safe 
surroundings. Such conditions exist in Tbilisi, Rustavi, and 
regions of western Georgia. Unfortunately, the way we behave 
often creates the impression among public opinion in Europe and 
throughout the world that it is impossible to enter Georgia. 
  I would also like to say that public order is the main 
factor 
which will enable our country to emerge from the crisis. We 
should be guided by this factor. 
  As I told you, a lot has changed. It happened primarily 
because the role of internal affairs bodies has increased and 
their organization, mobilization, and professionalism have 
improved. Of course, they are getting assistance from the 
Defense Ministry, the security forces, and others. However, the 
main burden should be borne by the police. 
  Despite all this, these are only the first steps, since many 
very serious crimes and terrorist acts which have plagued the 
country remain unsolved. 
  The meeting you mentioned agreed that the Security Service 
has to take on the difficult job of struggling against 
terrorism. I said that all responsibility for the struggle 
against terrorism should lie with the Security Service. Of 
course it needs assistance and all of us should help it, but it 
should bear the brunt of responsibility itself. 
  In a few days I will submit to parliament draft laws which 
must be adopted if we want the struggle against crime to be more 
efficient. Life has changed, and new types of crime have 
emerged requiring new approaches and new laws. Therefore, 
parliament should by all means complete this job before going 
into recess. The draft laws are now being prepared. 
  Finally, I would like to tell our listeners that the 
struggle 
against crime will not slow down. On the contrary, it will be 
stepped up every day, with more levels of society becoming 
involved in this struggle. 
  [Oniani] Since we have mentioned Rustavi, let me ask you a 
question about the election which will he held there on 12 June. 
As you know, there are many rumors about these elections. Do 
you view these elections with the perspective of head of state 
or of chairman of the Citizens' Union? In other words, can you 
express your preference for a particular candidate? 
  [Shevardnadze] I would not like to separate the two, and I 
want the position of chairman of the Citizens' Union and that of 
head of state to be compatible. 
  As for the specific issue of Rustavi, my preferences may not 
mean much. I am just stating facts. 
  Several days ago I met with Rustavi Mayor (Soso Areshidze). 
The meeting took place at the initiative of (Sergo 
Doprotsashvili), a candidate for deputy [of the Georgian 
parliament], who accompanied the mayor. 
  Their first request was that I help the people of Rustavi 
establish and consolidate public order. The candidate for 
deputy painted a truly bleak picture. I decided to give 
instructions to Interior Minister Shota Kviraia, who promptly 
prepared this operation, which, as you know, was carried out 
successfully. The people of Rustavi have expressed sincere 
gratitude for this. 
  I do not think that this operation should be a one-off 
measure and part of a (?election) campaign. The interior 
minister has promised me that the Interior Ministry will focus 
its attention on Rustavi, that such operations will continue, 
and that order will be established in Rustavi. [passage omitted] 
  If my opinion matters at all, I would say that the candidate 
for deputy made a very good impression. He is a hard-working, 
modest, cultured, and competent person. He is also a native of 
Rustavi and is familiar with all problems of its inhabitants. 
My impression is that he is not trying to gain popularity by 
making ostentatious and cheap effects. He is a businesslike 
person. That is my opinion, but of course it is for the people 
of Rustavi to decide whom to elect. 
  [Oniani] And the final question. Last week parliament gave a 
lot of attention to issues relating to the struggle against the 
mafia and corruption. Political parties and the mafia, 
officials and the mafia -- unfortunately, these issues are now 
being discussed among the public. Despite all the talk, there 
are few tangible results. There are reports that 
law-enforcement bodies have a lot of evidence concerning the 
involvement of officials and political leaders with the mafia. 
Some of this evidence has been published. It would be natural 
to ask what the authorities are waiting for. Are the situation 
and events unfolding today the reason for the authorities' delay 
in taking appropriate measures? 
  [Shevardnadze] When Georgia was in a state of civil war, 
which lasted in effect for several years, including the last few 
months of 1993 and the complex beginning of this year, it was 
difficult to speak about a struggle against corruption and 
organized crime. You know full well that these negative 
phenomena accompany wars. This dirty business comes to the 
surface during wars and sucks in a large proportion of the 
public. As soon as they were given the slightest chance the 
authorities emerged in the forefront of this struggle. A lot 
has been discovered, and there is still much more that remains 
to be revealed. Everything needs to be done in its own time and 
in appropriate circumstances. The struggle against the mafia 
and corrupt groups has to be dealt with by the whole of society 
and this will be achieved. 
  You may have noticed that in the last month -- or, rather, 
one and a half months -- a lot of material has been published in 
the press concerning the mafia, organized crime, and criminals 
in the economy, finance and so on. This is not the end of the 
story; on the contrary, even more material will be published in 
future. However, it will be published at a time when it can be 
published. 
  As regards parliament's active role in this, naturally, such 
a role by the supreme legislative body should be welcomed. 
Without it, there can be no talk of finally overcoming 
corruption as a phenomenon. However, parliament should work 
using methods that are appropriate for it. For parliament to 
take over the functions of the law-enforcement bodies and their 
operational services could lead to a further disaster. We could 
end up in a terrible situation of no return. 
  Therefore, I stress that parliament should work and exercise 
its right to control and check. However, when some deputies 
want classified information to be ... [pauses] How could that 
happen if classified information were to be obtained by special 
means and methods. Only employees serving this cause should 
have access to such information. If parliament were to look 
into it, advertise it, and make it public, not a single case 
would be solved in Georgia. As I told you, I know that there 
would be very bad results if the functions of legislative bodies 
and those of law-enforcement bodies were mixed up. As I told 
you, this would mean disaster. 
  [Oniani] Thank you for the interview.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 4/6/1994 -- General Aleksandr 
Lebed, 14th Army commander, stated in a recent interview, that 
he is in favour of settling certain political conflicts through 
force. "I passed through the battle schools of Afghanistan, 
Azerbaijan, and Armenia and I understood very clearly that in a 
crisis situation tough and unexpected measures should be taken. 
This is a guarantee that there will be no bloodshed for a long 
period. You can fight two-three years and lose every day 5-10 
soldiers. In a year the number of deaths will rise to 3,650. 
On the other hand, it is possible with a single strong strike 
to lose only 100 people and settle the problem once and for all. 
I followed this principle here, in Dniester, and succeeded in 
proving its validity." Chisinau is ready to make compromises to 
settle the problem, but Lebed believes that the process of 
conciliation and establishment of good relations between the two 
sides might take a long period. "After the war in Dniester 
(because a real war took place in Dniester) a deep rupture 
between Chisinau and Tiraspol emerged. It can be removed only 
by time and the trust between the sides will be recovered very 
slowly. The fact that realistic people have come into the 
Moldovan Parliament is a first step in this direction," said 
Lebed.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Maryukha report: "Petr Velikiy Should Join the </F>
Russian Fleet in Time for Its 300th Anniversary"] 
  [Text] On the eve of its 300th anniversary the Russian 
Navy has been beset by economic adversity like a "wolf pack" (a 
tactic employed by German submariners during World War II -- 
author's note). Large surface ships with powerful arms enabling 
them to perform a broad range of tasks have ended up the most 
vulnerable and, as is the case in any war, the most tempting 
"targets," albeit only financial. 
  At one time there were not even the funds to finish 
construction of the last in a series of four ships -- the 
nuclear-powered missile cruiser Petr Velikiy. The hull of the 
fifth ship in this class was cut to "ribbons" shortly before the 
scheduled commissioning of the Petr Velikiy. Thus, the ship 
bearing the name of the founder of the regular Russian Navy has 
turned out to be the last cruiser that the Navy hopes to receive 
in the coming years. 
  Instead of taking to the seas back in 1991 the Petr Velikiy 
was "frozen" in the waters of the Neva until last spring. Then 
in April 1993 First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin 
personally took charge of the allocation of funds for the 
cruiser's completion. Certain representatives of Russia's 
business class also displayed commercial patriotic sentiments. 
Thus, the leadership of "Inkombank" expressed the desire to 
donate 10 million rubles to the ship's construction -- free of 
charge -- reviving the traditions of Russian patronage and 
sponsorship of science and the state's defense programs. Just 
over a year later, last May, the State Duma Committee for 
Defense took charge of the Petr Velikiy's completion. At 
working level -- according to the Russian Defense Ministry Press 
and Information Directorate -- the work is being monitored, in 
light of the extremely limited military budget, by the Defense 
Ministry leadership, the Navy command, Viktor Glukhikh, chairman 
of the Russian Committee for the Defense Sectors of Industry, 
and other officials who have been aboard the ship. 
  What is the significance of the ship, completion of whose 
construction the Russian Defense Ministry describes as the 
priority in shipbuilding in recent years? Conceived in the late 
sixties, the nuclear-powered missile cruiser first took concrete 
shape in 1980. Since then the state maritime interests of first 
the Soviet Union and then Russia have gained a major defensive 
tool -- with unlimited range, autonomy, and highly powerful 
armaments. But Russian construction schedule overruns are 
unknown to foreign navies, and the United States now regards its 
Navy as the only one to hold sway in the oceans of the world. 
The Petr Velikiy is necessary today in order to talk to them on 
an equal footing and in order to ensure that Russia's 
shipbuilding industry does not break up once and for all. 
  For three years now KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has been keeping a 
careful eye on the fate of the cruiser, on which the "Baltiyskiy 
Zavod" Joint-Stock Company, under the direction of chief 
construction worker Gennadiy Starshinov, is completing the 
installation of equipment and arms. Regrettably, we did not in 
the past succeed in inducing our rich fellow citizens to provide 
material assistance in the completion of the Varyag, although 
the poor were willing to give their last cent to produce the 
Navy's last aircraft carrier. But international relations 
intervened then and the Varyag ended up outside Russia. The 
Petr Velikiy is within Russia's borders and the schedule for the 
completion of the work on it has stabilized, although the pace 
of the work is slower than what is desirable. Nevertheless, the 
cruiser can be expected to start mooring trials and a shakedown 
cruise this year and it should certainly be commissioned in time 
for the 300th anniversary of the Russian Navy. However, it 
would still be in order for entrepreneurs to help with its 
completion. This tradition -- patronage of new ships -- is 
worthy of revival, just as a powerful ocean-going Russian Navy 
is worthy of revival.

  [Text] The Chechen authorities have denied ex-speaker of 
the Russian parliament Ruslan Khasbulatov the right to live in 
their republic. During a joint meeting of the Chechen 
government, parliament and security council, the residence right 
was also denied to some Chechen opposition leaders engaged in 
illegal activity. 
  The Chechen Foreign Ministry told Interfax that the list of 
people accused of anti-Chechen activity and collaboration with 
the Russian imperial forces included Doka Zavgayev, the last 
Chechen-Ingush Communist Party leader who lives in Moscow, and 
Yaragi Mamadayev, the head of the Government of People's Trust 
he has established on his own. 
  The joint session adopted a resolution which says that the 
leaders of the opposition, in conjunction with the Russian 
leadership, had drafted plans for the elimination of independent 
Chechnya. 
  It also says that these plans included the introduction of a 
state of emergency in a part of Ingushetia's Sunzhen and 
Malgobek regions bordering on Chechnya, and the attempted 
assassination of President Dudayev. 
  The Chechen Foreign Ministry also alleges that on the eve of 
the opposition congress, which was to be held last Saturday in 
Chechnya's Nadterechnyy Region, Russian troops were concentrated 
near the Chechen borders, and 26 helicopters were put in a state 
of combat readiness in North Ossetia. 
  "The aggressive plans were a failure because the congress 
was 
not held in the absence of the quorum," said a representative of 
the Chechen president's staff.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Andronaki under the rubric "Island of </F>
Crimea": "Leisure in the Crimea has Become Suspiciously Active"] 
  [Text] On Saturday [4 June] V. Nedrigaylo, Ukrainian first 
deputy minister of internal affairs, unexpectedly made an 
appearance on Crimean television to explain that the Crimean MVD 
[Ministry of Internal Affairs] has finally been disbanded, 
transformed into a Main Directorate of Internal Affairs, and 
placed under the jurisdiction of the department in Kiev. But 
within an hour Vyacheslav Lebedev, the Crimean president's press 
secretary, and and Valeriy Kuznetsov, the autonomous formation's 
minister of internal affairs, appeared on television and stated 
that nothing of the kind had happened and that Mr. Nedrigaylo's 
speech was bogus and a piece of disinformation. 
  Meanwhile, Ukrainian television described how in Lvov the 
leaders of the Ukrainian People's Self-Defense are busily 
turning some of their thugs into "active leisure groups," which 
will be sent to the Crimea. Since the Don cossacks have gone to 
the peninsula as "tourists," they say, we have found our own way 
of assembling forces to protect national interests. 
  Since not one of the Supreme Council's three decrees on the 
suspension of the Crimean Supreme Council's decisions has been 
fulfilled, on Wednesday the Ukrainian parliament intends to 
discuss more effective measures to pressure the autonomous 
formation's power structures. 
  Kiev cannot tear itself away from the idea of a unitary 
state 
that it proclaimed three years ago and cannot fully come to 
terms with the experience provided by relations between Russia 
and Tatarstan. 
  Of course, Ukraine is far removed from the popular image of 
a 
land of jaunty gopaks and fruit dumplings. But since achieving 
statehood it has come to grief over what was not the greatest of 
all stumbling blocks and cannot restore equilibrium, confirming 
yet again the shortsightedness of the present politicians and 
the weakness of the idea of nationalism as a state doctrine. 
This also explains the Ukrainian parliament's indecisive 
hesitation over one thing, namely, the dangerous choice of which 
direction to take; either to push Kravchuk into introducing 
direct presidential rule in the Crimea, or to declare a state of 
emergency there and disband the local Supreme Council, or to 
abolish the autonomous formation completely. Any of these 
decisions will be a call to action for both the Lvov "active 
leisure groups" and the Don cossacks. God knows what will 
happen then. 
  Incidentally, there has been a considerable increase 
recently 
in the number of people at prayer in the Republic's Orthodox 
churches....

  [Text] North Korea rejects pressure as a tool to solve the 
nuclear problem of the peninsula. Its Foreign Minister Kim 
Yong-nam said so in Ukraine where he arrived on 6 June. 
  He said that direct talks with Seoul were the only way to 
have the problem solved and that North Korea wanted to make the 
Korean peninsula a nuclear-free zone. 
  Kim Yong-nam expressed the hope that the third round of 
talks 
between Pyongyang and Seoul would bring about positive results 
in that field. 
  He welcomed Ukraine's desire to become a nonnuclear country. 
  Kim Yong-nam and his Ukrainian counterpart Anatoliy Zlenko 
will have talks Monday afternoon.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Pavel Spirin and Vyacheslav </F>
Tomilin] 
  [Text] Beijing June 6 TASS -- China intends to "seriously" 
study the Russian proposal on holding an international 
conference on the nuclear problem of the Korean peninsula, but 
believes it is better to solve it through talks between 
Pyongyang, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the USA and 
South Korea, according to a spokesman of the Chinese Foreign 
Ministry. 
  "We have taken into consideration the Russian-proposed 
idea", 
he told TASS on Monday, but added that, according to the Chinese 
Government, "the most efficient and practical variant of solving 
the problem is to hold bilateral consultations in three 
directions: North Korea - the IAEA, North Korea - the United 
States, and Pyongyang - Seoul". 
  Beijing is conducting an active dialogue with the North 
Korean leadership on its nuclear programme, according to sources 
close to diplomatic circles. It strives to preserve "special 
relations" between the two countries and at the same time to 
exert influence on its partner in order to settle the conflict 
without any sanctions. 
  It is noteworthy that last Saturday the North Korean 
ambassador in China has resolutely rejected the Russian idea 
about the international conference. The nuclear free status of 
the peninsula should be discussed only in a close circle - 
between North Korea and the United States. 
  However, the Hong Kong-based "TA KUNG PAO" newspaper is sure 
that China can join economic sanctions against Pyongyang. It 
believes Beijing can cease shipments of food and oil.

  [Text] Moscow, 7 Jun -- China does not support the 
imposition of economic sanctions on the DPRK because this 
measure "can only lead to an escalation of tensions on the 
Korean peninsula." This was said today in an interview with the 
ITAR-TASS correspondent by Sui Tsin, minister-counsellor at the 
Chinese embassy in Moscow. He described reports in the Hong 
Kong press about the possibility of China joining the sanctions 
as untrustworthy. 
  China has limited influence on the DPRK, the diplomat added, 
and it depends on the Koreans themselves whether North Korea 
finally accepts the IAEA's demands concerning its nuclear 
program. 
  The Chinese diplomat spoke in favor of continuing 
negotiations and looking for compromises.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vasiliy Golovnin] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo, 7 Jun--An executive staff member of the 
Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs told an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent today that Tokyo does not think that it makes any 
sense in the current situation to seriously study Russia's 
proposal on holding an international conference on the Korean 
peninsula with the participation of the two Korean states, 
China, the Russian Federation, the United States, Japan, the 
United Nations, and the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
  He noted that Tokyo now intends to achieve a solution to the 
problem of Pyongyang's nuclear program primarily on the basis of 
close consultations with the United States and South Korea. The 
Government of Japan, the member of the Foreign Ministry staff 
stated, also places hope in the upcoming session of the UN 
Security Council relating to this issue. On Monday, Tokyo 
officially announced that it is prepared to join in the 
sanctions against the Korean People's Democratic Republic, 
within the framework of its Constitution, if the United Nations 
agrees to this measure. 
  Earlier, Pyongyang itself did, in fact, reject Moscow's 
proposal that an international conference should be held to 
settle the tension on the peninsula, having confirmed its 
intention to discuss with the United States alone the issue of 
its nuclear program and the possible complete withdrawal from 
the system of the treaty on the nonproliferation of nuclear 
weapons. 
  To all appearances, Washington is also taking a passive 
attitude toward Russia's initiative, although President Bill 
Clinton has also stated that it would possibly make sense to 
implement it if events were to develop in a certain way.

  [Excerpt] [No dateline as received] DPRK Foreign Minister 
Kim Yong-nam accused the West of applying "double standards" in 
its approach to nuclear problems. "When there is a question of 
countries which Washington regards as docile, it turns a blind 
eye to everything. If, however, insubordinate and defiant 
countries are involved, the United States spreads false rumors 
and disinformation, claiming they have seen and discovered 
things even when they have not seen anything at all," he told 
newsmen in Kiev. 
  The North Korean minister made this statement in the context 
of international pressure on the DPRK because of its nuclear 
program. 
  Pyongyang contends that it is only at talks with the United 
States that a comprehensive solution can be found to problems of 
the Korean peninsula. Only dialogue with Washington can help 
the DPRK rejoin the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, the DPRK 
says. 
  Kim Yong-nam said his government is looking into Russia's 
proposal to hold an international conference on security and on 
the nuclear-free status of the Korean peninsula. [passage

  [Text] Kiev, 7 Jun -- "It is too early to talk about an 
international conference on the subject of the North Korean 
nuclear program. We are still studying the Russian initiative," 
PDRK Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam said today in an exclusive 
interview with ITAR-TASS. The minister was reluctant to make 
further comments. He said that he will speak about this 
question in more detail at a news conference that will take 
place in Kiev tomorrow afternoon. 
  As is known, Russia had recently come forward with an 
initiative for solving the crisis in the Korean peninsula by 
convening an international conference to be attended by the two 
Korean states, the United States, Japan, China, Russia, the 
United Nations, and the International Atomic Energy Agency.

Cooperation and Development (OECD) is a representative body, 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev who has come to Paris to 
attend the organization's session told correspondents here today. 
  The OECD was created by a number of industrially developed 
states to exchange experience and assistance in consolidation of 
economies, said the Russian minister. An equal dialogue with 
the OECD Russia is joining will help Russian efforts to create 
efficient market economy, he added. 
  A package of cooperation documents will be signed by Russia

meet OECD heads and ministers. 
  According to Andrey Kozyrev, another set of actions to 
consolidate the Russian status as a full-fledged member of the 
world leaders' club will soon be carried out. Russia is on the 
verge of an important agreement with the European Union. The 
agreement may be signed already this month. 
  The Russian participation in the Naples meeting of the G7 
will be a major event, said Andrey Kozyrev. One can say that 
the meeting will witness the G7's turning into the "eight" in 
the part of political dialogue.

<F P=106> [Report by RIA NOVOSTI correspondent Vladimir Bibikov </F>
specially for ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI: "Electronic `Threads' To Link 
CIS Enterprises"] 
  [Text] An interstate electronic system of information 
cooperation among industrial enterprises has been ratified 
within the CIS. This decision was reached at a routine 
conference of the council of CIS industrial enterprise chief 
designers. 
  "Some 5,000 plants in six of the biggest Commonwealth 
countries will be able to pass their customers information on 
the parameters, cost, and terms for selling their output, and to 
obtain similar information on other producers' materials and 
products," Leonid Gancharik, chairman of the chief designers' 
council and general director of the "Tsentrsistem" Science and 
Production Association in Minsk, said. "Subscription to the 
service will make it possible to obtain regular thematic 
information without any additional request being made, along 
with an analysis of the market situation regarding availability 
of goods and their price. Above all, shipments of output under 
intergovernmental agreements will be placed under operational 
control." 
  The creation of this global information network is very 
important today. Simply reducing crosshauls and "freeing up" 
middlemen will have enormous benefits -- accurate knowledge of 
the market situation plays a fundamental role in the fate of 
enterprises. Similar information structures have long been in 
operation in many industrially developed countries. 
  Any enterprise with ordinary telegraphic communications, a 
phone line with a modem, or a fax can link up with the system. 
These information "nerves" will join up at republic and 
regional centers. For instance, there will be 12 of them in 
Russia, linked by high-speed modems. There will be no "main" 
center in the system -- all of them will have absolutely equal 
rights and technical capabilities. Nor will any country have 
priority in obtaining, processing, and transmitting important 
production and economic information.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 8 TASS -- ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI carries an 
article by State Duma Deputy Vladimir Lysenko under the headline 
"What Prevents Russia From Becoming a Full-Value Federation". 
  Lysenko's opinion is that the Constitutions of republics 
should accord with Russia's fundamental law which is "the 
cornerstone of the strengthening of Russian statehood and the 
development of federative relations". "This is, of course, not 
to the liking of all political forces and their leaders. But we 
all should move on from words to deeds to create a powerful 
Russian state," Lysenko pointed out. 
  In ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, writer Yuriy Chernichenko, member of 
the Federation Council and chairman of the Peasants' Party of 
Russia, describes the current agrarian reform in the country as 
a slack one. He says it has no proclaimed goals, a manifest, or 
an ideology. It has, instead, a lot of purely Russian and 
"Soviet" peculiarities which determine its slack nature and 
immediate and distant prospects. 
  The writer's detailed reflections on the subject are to be 
published in one of future issues of the newspaper. 
  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA interviewed Sergey Belyayev, general 
director of the Federal Directorate for Insolvency (bankruptcy). 
He describes the importance of a new concept of the relevant 
legislation which is being prepared by his organisation. 
  "Then, we shall have a clear idea of how many enterprises 
are 
really insolvent and are potential bankrupts or, on the 
contrary, can restore their paying capacity". 
  As of now, he said there are about 1,200 large insolvent 
enterprises in Russia. Pointing out that most people are 
psychologically unprepared to seek protection under 
circumstances unexpected for them, Belyayev draws the following 
conclusion:" "there is no detonator more dangerous for a social 
conflict than a quiet self-liquidation of insolvent enterprises". 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (Red Star) raises the question of the need 
to 
enhance social protection of the military, which is essential, 
first of all, to uphold Russia's interests. 
  The Army does not ask for something extra. It needs firm 
social guarantees backed up financially, not lamentations that 
these are hard times for everyone, the newspaper points out. 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carries an interview with Igor Puzanov, 
first 
deputy commander of the troops of the Moscow Military District, 
who points out the importance of a rise in the professionalism 
standards in the forces, which is hindered, he said, by the 
"scarcity of resources". 
  "It is possible and necessary to economise but there is the 
limit below which one should not go in arrangements for combat 
and operation training of troops and officer personnel. This 
would be dangerous for the state and would threaten with 
irreversible consequences", Puzanov said. 
  TRUD runs an interview with Fyodor Prokopov, director of the 
Federal Employment Service. He points out that as of May 1, 
there were 1,180,000 officially registered unemployed in Russia. 
He predicts that their number will grow to about 12 million 
towards the end of the year but that six million of them will be 
able to get new jobs quickly: commercial entities and 
small-business enterprises gain in scope. 
  Prokopov urges the jobless to learn to acquire skills that 
the country needs, monitor the labour market situation and try 
their hand in new lines of business. 
  PRAVDA, referring to the data of the Federal Employment 
Service, writes that the number of unemployed in Russia has 
grown by 40 percent since the beginning of the year. The 
highest unemployment rate was observed in the Jewish autonomous 
region, Evenkia, Karachai-Cherkesia, Amur region and Khabarovsk 
territory as well as in central regions of Russia. 
  The newspaper quotes Vice-Premier Yuriy Yarov as stating 
that 
mass unemployment threatens with such a social outburst, 
compared to which hyperinflation consequences would pale into 
insignificance. 
  PRAVDA carries an interview with Leonid Filatov, a merited 
artist of Russia, an actor, stage director and writer, who 
criticises the country's reform process. In his view, the 
reforms lead "in a wrong direction". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA runs the full text of a project for the 
formation of a Euro-Asian union of states. This has been done 
at the request of Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who 
sent the text out to the heads of state of CIS countries. 
  The document points out that all CIS countries experience a 
deep crisis. Their development is determined by two trends. 
There is a further formation of national statehood, on the one 
hand, and there is a tendency towards CIS countries' 
integration, on the other. 
  TRUD interviewed Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk who 
pointed out that Ukraine and Russia had lived "within a single 
power" for 340 years. No one ever took up arms to fight each 
other, he said. 
  "When I am asked whether there will be a war between Russia 
and Ukraine, I answer `no' without hesitation," Kravchuk said. 
"I want relations between Russia and Ukraine to be built with an 
eye to long-term development", he emphasised. 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA singles out a report that Ukrainian 
nationalists' leader Dmitriy Korchinskiy issued an order to 
paramilitary units "to be prepared to go to the Crimea". An 
article to this effect is headlined "They Are Already Prepared 
To Resort to Killing in the Crimea".

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 108 598] </F>
  [Text] About 40 bills will be soon submitted to the State 
Duma by the president to sustain the recent presidential 
economic decrees. 
  The Duma speaker Ivan Rybkin told Interfax that the problem 
was discussed during his meeting with Russian President Yeltsin 
on Tuesday. 
  Rybkin said under discussion was the upcoming debate in the 
State Duma of the country's federal budget for 1994 because, as 
he said, the country's finances are the main component part of 
the reforms. The budget will be debated in the second reading on 
Wednesday. 
  Asked whether President Yeltsin made proposals concerning 
the 
budget, Rybkin said that the president and he agree that the 
budget should be balanced and the interests of everybody should 
be taken into account. 
  Earlier in an interview Rybkin said that the bill on the 
Russian federal budget will be adopted in the second reading in 
June. 
  Rybkin said that it is planned to increase subsidizing 
research work in line with the conversion program, as well as 
science, education, culture and the social sphere and channel 
for the purpose eight trillion rubles. 
  Rybkin said that the Duma together with the government is 
searching for additional sources of profit, including from the 
arms exports. 
  Asked how he assesses the recommendations on the need to 
increase expenditures for defense from 37 to 55 trillion rubles, 
Rybkin said that everyone may have a dream, but everyone must 
see the reality. 
  IF Note: Chairman of the committee for budget of the 
Federation Council, Nikolay Gonchar on Tuesday asked deputies to 
support the proposal on increasing allocations for defense 
purposes. He said that late in April the Duma speaker Ivan 
Rybkin sent to President Yeltsin a letter where he explains the 
need to increase military spendings up to 55 trillion rubles. 
According to Gonchar, on May 6 the letter with Yeltsin's words 
on its "I consider it expendient to agree to defense amendments 
for the budget" was sent to Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.

  [Text] In the Russian State Duma the New Regional Policy 
group is going to vote for the federal budget in the second 
reading on condition the spending on defence is increased from 
37 to 55 trillion rubles and subsidies to territories from 18 to 
23 trillion. This was reported to Interfax on Monday by the head 
of the group Vladimir Medvedev. The group of 64 deputies is the 
second biggest in the lower house of parliament following 
Russia's Choice. Most members of New Regional Policy supported 
the federal budget during the first reading on May 11. 
  Yabloko group does not support the draft budget submitted by 
the government on the whole because it does not reflect an 
economic policy the country would need today. This was told to 
Interfax by the head of the group Grigoriy Yavlinskiy. He said 
his group voted against the budget in the first reading and it 
would be strange, he said, if it changed its approach by the 
second reading. Still Yavlinskiy said his group would support 
certain amendments to the budget. 
  The Liberal-Democratic Union of December 12 will support the 
draft budget, if it does not exceed the deficit named during the 
first reading. The leader of the group, former finance minister 
Boris Fedorov told Interfax that his group would agree to 
increase spending on defence research by no more than 3.5 
trillion rubles as the budget committee suggests. 
  Russia's Choice did not meet on Tuesday and intends to 
define 
its attitude to the draft on Wednesday before the Duma session. 
  The heads and experts of the Communist, Agrarian and 
Democratic factions intend to agree on a common stand during the 
budget debate planned for Wednesday. This was reported to 
Interfax by Yevgeniy Krasnitskiy (Communist). He said his group 
will also insist on increasing the revenue by improving 
tax-collecting as well as spending. It plans to support the 
proposal of parliamentary committees for defence to increase 
defence spending from 37 to 55 trillion. He denied claims that 
Communists would vote against the budget. "The budget proposed 
by the government is rotten, of course, but even a bad budget is 
better than none", he said. 
  The leader of the Liberal-Democratic Party Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy and a considerable part of his faction will 
evidently be absent from the Wednesday session because on 
Tuesday they began a tour of Krasnodar region. However, on 
Monday Zhirinovskiy told Interfax that economists from the 
faction would take part in the discussion of amendments to the 
budget. The lower house is go [as received] discuss some 300 
amendments. 
  Yevgeniy Nikonov of the Party of Russian Unity and Concord 
expressed the opinion that his faction would support the idea of 
increasing budget spending.

  [Text] Moscow June 7 TASS -- The Russian Government should 
use the 1994 budget revenue reserves to solve the most acute 
social and economic problems, Chairman of the State Duma 
Committee for Budget, Taxes, Banks and Finances Mikhail Zadornov 
told a news conference here today in view of the Duma's second 
reading of the draft 1994 budget. 
  These problems include financial support to Federation 
subjects, defence spending, fundamental science, education and 
preservation of cultural monuments, said the deputy. In his 
opinion, such distribution of budget means will help to preserve 
the defence, scientific and cultural potential of Russia. 
  The money can be found as the "Russian Government has 
envisaged a number of reserves in the draft budget," he said. 
At the same time, the reserves should not exceed the limits of 
the Duma-approved spending, revenues and the budget deficit. 
  For instance, 1,500,000,000,000 rubles can be received from 
cuts of the domestic debt payment. Another 3,000,000,000,000 
rubles can be taken from the reduced amount of foreign drawings. 
It is also necessary to cut by 15 per cent the spending on 
state management structures, whose size has increased by eight 
times as compared to last year, said Zadornov.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Kuznets report in the "Budget" column: "The Duma </F>
Intends To Increase Military Spending. Mikhail Zadornov 
Believes This Is `Profanation of the Budget Process'"] 
  [Text] Mikhail Zadornov, chairman of the Duma Budget, 
Banks, and Finances Committee, will recommend to the lower 
chamber at its session today not to consider amendments to the 
budget involving a change of its basic indicators: revenues, 
expenditures, and deficit. According to Zadornov, the Duma is 
bound to such a decision by the budget procedure it has itself 
approved. Under it, Mikhail Zadornov's committee has singled 
out all amendments that affect the basic indicators so that "the 
Duma rejects them automatically." Zadornov allows, however, 
that "some factions" today are going to return to the discussion 
of the main indicators "with a view to increase military 
spending to 55 trillion for populist considerations." A return 
to the adopted figures of the main budget indicators, according 
to Zadornov, "will turn the budget process into profanation." 
  According to Zadornov, the committee, "in spite of 
multiplying rumors about the idea of raising military spending 
being supported by the president," so far has only an amendment 
on this score by Sergey Glazyev. Zadornov said that "neither 
the president nor the government has submitted any amendments on 
increasing military spending to the Duma." Zadornov made the 
following supposition: "Possibly the president himself or 
through his representative will submit his proposals on defense 
needs to us at the plenary session itself." 
  A similar recommendation by the Federation Council was not 
executed as an amendment and was not even adopted in principle, 
which does not allow to consider it formally. Even so, Nikolay 
Gonchar, chairman of the Federation Council Budget Committee, 
speaking at yesterday's session of the Duma New Regional Policy 
faction, stated that "the senate will never approve a budget 
that places the economy of Russia's 33 regions, which is made up 
by military industrial complex enterprises, on its knees." 
  The committee also rejected Glazyev's proposal to increase 
budget revenues with receipts from privatization because "nobody 
knows what the system of selling property will be after 1 July." 
Zadornov considers it possible to create a targeted 
extra-budgetary fund for defense needs if money from 
privatization is generated in the volumes promised by Glazyev. 
The committee does not advise the Duma to include these 
revenues in the budget, however, unless it wants the 
government's indebtedness to the Defense Ministry, "which will 
be inevitable even with the military spending level as 
envisioned under the original draft budget," to become really 
catastrophic. 
  According to information in SEGODNYA's possession, in spite 
of the budget committee's opinion, the communists, the Party of 
Russian Unity and Accord, New Regional Policy, the agrarians, 
and the Democratic Party of Russia are ready to vote for a 
return to the basic budget figures. The Communist Party of the 
Russian Federation, the Agrarian Party of Russia, and the 
Democratic Party of Russia yesterday summoned a special joint 
conference on this issue. If the agro-communist coalition fails 
to get the Duma to return to the consideration of the main 
indicators, they can vote against the budget. The Yabloko 
faction, with which Zadornov is affiliated, will vote against 
both increasing military spending and against the budget as a 
whole. Russia's Choice and Women of Russia will in all 
likelihood support the committee. The majority of deputies from 
the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia together with their 
leader will go on a trip around the country and will not take 
part in the budget process.

  [Excerpt] The State Duma Budget Committee on Budget, Taxes, 
Banks, and Finances' fears about the dynamics of production this 
year have proved to be right, Committee Chairman Mikhail 
Zadornov told the media today. The results of the first four 
months of the year are depressing. The fall in production is 
still 25 percent. Only 9 percent of taxes were collected instead 
of 11 percent. As a result, revenues covered only about half of 
budget spending, namely 49 per cent. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Andrey Ishchenko: "In Moscow They Are Asking the </F>
President for Money"] 
  [Text] Tamara Zlotnikova, deputy chairman of the Russian 
State Duma Committee for Ecology, has yet again urged the 
president to intervene personally in the state's ecological 
policy. "For the first time men's life expectancy has dropped 
below pension age, deformed children are being born, and 
Russians are on the threshold of irreversible changes beyond 
which the collapse of the state and the death of the peoples are 
possible," Zlotnikova wrote in her letter to Yeltsin. 
  Less than 0.6 percent of the expenditure section of the 
budget, or 0.15 percent of the gross domestic product, is 
earmarked for ecological programs. That has never happened in a 
single civilized or even not very civilized country, although 
the troubled and in places catastrophic nature of the ecological 
situation is obliging people to increase financing for 
environmental conservation at least to some extent. According 
to some figures, the ecological damage throughout the country in 
1993 totaled 15 trillion rubles, and this year it is forecast at 
43 trillion, which is over 40 times the expenditure envisaged on 
ecology in the budget.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>
  [Text] President Nursultan Nazarbayev has sent to the 
leaders of CIS countries a draft document on the formation of an 
Eurasian Union, a new integrating association of post-Soviet 
countries. 
  The plan INTERFAX has at its disposal implies that potential 
members of the union should sign a treaty forming the legal and 
organizational prerequisites "for deepening integration with the 
purpose of forming an economic, currency, and political union." 
According to the plan, associated membership in the union is not 
permitted. The termination of hostilities is one of the 
preliminary conditions for entering the union. 
  The preamble of the document says that the potential of the 
CIS has not been exhausted. The Commonwealth plays a positive 
role in offering a legal framework for relations between its 
member-countries. However, according to the Kazakh leader, the 
existing structure of CIS bodies does not allow to fully benefit 
from the potential of integration. Nazarbayev believes that 
economic integration prompts the need to develop political 
institutions having sufficient powers. 
  Among such supernational political structures of the future 
union Nazarbayev named the Eurasian parliament -- the supreme 
consultative body formed of an equal number of MP's from 
member-countries or through direct elections. The main purpose 
of the parliament would be the coordination of laws of 
member-countries guaranteeing the development of a common 
economic space, social security and human rights. Under the 
plan the decisions of parliament would come into force after 
their ratification by member-countries of the union. 
  Nazarbayev also suggested forming a permanent executive 
committee. He feels that a ministry for the Eurasian Union 
should be set up in each country for better coordination and 
more effective joint activities. 
  The plan sent to CIS leaders also implies the formation of 
several supernational economic bodies such as the economic 
commission of the Council of the Heads of State that would work 
out the strategy of economic reforms, a commission for raw 
materials that would coordinate and approve prices and quotas of 
exported raw materials and fuel as well as gold and other 
precious metals. An international investment bank would be set 
up as well as a commission for a common unit for settlements. 
Nazarbayev also suggests setting up a commission for 
international financial and industrial groups and joint ventures 
and economic arbitration. The latter would settle disputed 
matters and impose fines. 
  In keeping with Nazarbayev's plan the Eurasian union would 
have a common defence space and coordinated defence activities. 
For the purpose a treaty on joint efforts to strengthen the 
armed forces of member-countries and on the protection of the 
common borders would be signed. A collective peace-keeping 
force would be formed and the UN Security Council would be asked 
to give the contingent an appropriate status. "All union 
members, except Russia, would keep their nuclear-free status," 
the document says. 
  Nazarbayev favors the formation of an environmental fund of 
member-nations. The plan also speaks of the need for an 
international treaty on dumping nuclear wastes. Among the 
long-term joint programs for restoring the environment 
Nazarbayev named the Aral sea, Chernobyl, and the Semipalatinsk 
nuclear test ground. 
  Under the plan, if a citizen of a union member-country 
chooses to move to another Eurasian country, he or she will 
automatically become citizen of the new country of residence. 
  It is suggested to make Russian the official language of the 
union and a city near the dividing line between Europe and Asia, 
for instance Kazan or Samara, the capital of the union. 
  IF [INTERFAX] Note: Nazarbayev came out with the idea of a 
Eurasian Union during his Moscow visit last March. CIS leaders 
have regarded the idea with reserve, except the Kyrgyz President 
Askar Akaev who welcomed it. It was not discussed at the latest 
CIS summit in April. In a recent statement for newsmen the 
press secretary of the Kazakh leader Nurlan Danenov said 
Nazarbayev's idea became the subject of an incorrect political 
debate which is allegedly aimed at driving a wedge between CIS 
leaders due to their different approaches to Nazarbayev's 
concept. 
  Analysts believe that Nazarbaev's plan will hardly become 
the 
subject of an official discussion of CIS leaders in the nearest 
future. Neither do they foresee great changes in the attitude 
of most Commonwealth leaders to the plan despite Nazarbayev's 
assurances that the union would be only an additional 
integration structure, not an alternative to the CIS.

  [Text] Almaty, 7 June -- "The main goal of my visit is to 
speed up the implementation of the accords between the two 
states which were attained earlier," Salman Khurshid, India's 
minister of state for external affairs, said at a press 
conference here today after completing his visit to Kazakhstan. 
  "We have seen once again," the minister said, "that 
Kazakhstan leadership adheres to the strengthening of ties with 
India and the development of mutually beneficial cooperation of 
businessmen from both countries." He noted with satisfaction 
that a business council to coordinate joint activity had been 
set up. A solemn ceremony to inaugurate an Indian cultural 
center will be held in Almaty soon, and an Indian restaurant 
will open. By late June, regular Almaty- Delhi flights will 
start, something to boost bilateral relations even further. 
  "During the visit," Salman Khurshid stressed, "mutual 
understanding of the need to sign accords on avoiding double 
taxation of exported goods and providing firm guarantees for 
investments took shape." He expressed the confidence that 
Kazakhstan and India would actively cooperate in many 
international organizations to secure peace and stability on the 
Asian continent. 
  The Indian delegation left Almaty for Bishkek today.

  [Text] Today a news conference was held at the Kazakhstani 
Foreign Ministry on the outcome of Foreign Minister Saudabayev's 
visit to Russia. Deputy Minister Konstantin Zhigalov told 
correspondents about the main problems of the visit, which took 
place on 2-3 June. The main aim of the visit was to monitor the 
implementation of agreements signed at a summit level during the 
first official visit by President Nazarbayev to Moscow, as well 
as to prepare Yeltsin's visit to Kazakhstan. 
  The foreign minister met Russia's First Vice Prime Minister 
Soskovets, State Duma Chairman Rybkin, Moscow Mayor Luzhkov, and 
Yakovlev, head of the federal service for teleevision and radio. 
Talks were held with the foreign minister of Russia. During 
these meetings, problems related to the economy, defense, and 
the Caspian Sea were discussed, taking into account social and 
legal norms. Particular attention was paid to the problem of 
citizenship. Kazakhstan's proposals on the problem met 
understanding and support from the Russian side. 
  It is worth noting that the stance of Kazakhstan on dual 
citizenship is unequivocally negative. In the context of 
further deepening the integration processes, Nazarbayev's ideas 
on a Eurasian union was discussed during the meetings. The 
Russian side gave a positive assessment of this concept. 
However, not everybody had a detailed knowledge of the 
document. Today its draft was published in the republican press. 
  Great attention was paid to international problems, in 
particular participation of the two states in the NATO 
Partnership for Peace program. As is known, Kazakhstan has 
signed this document. The situation in hotbeds of war was 
discussed. By the way, in the draft of the Eurasian Union, in 
state where civil war is occurring, they will not be accepted as 
members of the union. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Zhigalov answered questions and said 
that the correspondents could acquaint themselves in full detail 
with the documents signed during the visit.

  [Text] Almaty 7 June TASS -- An overwhelming majority of 
experts do not believe in the reforming ability of the Kazakh 
Parliament and many do not rule it out that it will be dissolved 
soon, according to an opinion poll taken by the Almaty Centre 
for Humanitarian Studies among Kazakh political scientists, 
leaders of public movements and political parties, ranking civil 
servants and prominent journalists. 
  The findings of the poll, published on Tuesday [7 June], 
indicate that 61.8 percent of respondents believe that the 
Kazakhstan parliament in its present composition will not be 
able to act as a catalyst of reforms in society, 44.1 percent of 
experts maintain that the deputies corps has a low level of 
political culture, and 41.2 percent explain their attitude by 
the parliamentarians' estrangement from the electorate due to 
various kinds of irregularities during the parliamentary 
elections and the imperfection of the electoral system. 
  The opinion of 61.8 percent of experts is that the election 
campaign was of an utterly undemocratic nature, and 44.1 percent 
of respondents do not rule out the probability that the Kazakh 
Parliament will be dissolved soon.

  [Text] The World Bank is to extend Kyrgyzstan a loan of 
$1.5 billion for implementing a three-year program for economic 
restructuring. In 1994-95 it will also receive $550 million to 
cover the balance of payment deficit and back up social programs. 
  The agreement on the loan was signed during the consultative 
conference of the World Bank and Kyrgyz representatives in Paris 
on 2 and 3 June, Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev told a press 
conference in Bishkek. 
  The program for economic restructuring envisages measures to 
lower the inflation rate to 3 percent (it stood at 7.5 percent 
last May) and to 2.5 percent by the middle of 1995. By the end 
of 1997, the annual rate of inflation is to stand at 4 percent. 
  Akayev said that, to date, Europe did not offer any 
significant assistance either to Kyrgyzstan or to Central Asia. 
  The U.S. and Japan are playing the biggest role in promoting 
the economic reform in Kyrgyzstan. 
  Akayev said he was disappointed with the results of 
cooperation with the European Commission and said that the 
credits extended last year were "the plunder of the poor." To 
quote the president, in Brussels he expressed disappointment 
with the program for technical assistance, proposed by the 
European Commission. 
  He said that this program was absolutely useless, because it 
benefitted only the European Commission's bureaucrats, so 
Kyrgyzstan no longer needed proposed consultations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Akmatbek Nanayev, Kirghiz ambassador </F>
extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Russia, by Pavel 
Shinkarenko; place and date not given: "Treaty With Russia 
Opens New Chapter in Kirghiz History"] 
  [Text] [Shinkarenko] Over the last few years Kyrgyzstan 
has concluded dozens of interstate agreements. Nevertheless, 
people in your country celebrate 10 June -- the date that the 
Treaty on Friendship and Cooperation With Russia was signed in 
1992 -- as an event of national importance. What is the reason 
for that? 
  [Nanayev] Let us recall the events of the time. Kyrgyzstan 
had just proclaimed its independence. The wholesale process of 
its diplomatic recognition may be said to have begun. These 
were worrying times. But our country was only really conscious 
of its independence after Askar Akayev and Boris Yeltsin signed 
the Treaty on Friendship and Cooperation Between the Kyrgyz 
Republic and Russia. This event was the point of departure from 
which the current history of our state began. The treaty with 
Russia is the foundation of cooperation between our countries 
based on equality, respect, and support for our peoples. 
  [Shinkarenko] The foundation of cooperation.... 
Construction schedule overruns and unfinished construction are 
associated with this word. What a lot of that we can remember! 
But what has it really proved possible to accomplish on this 
"foundation?" 
  [Nanayev] I can say with confidence that the first stories 
have already been built. Needless to say, the greatest progress 
has been made in the political sphere. Our presidents have 
really displayed political will here. Thanks to this the Treaty 
on Friendship has been supplemented by dozens of other 
agreements and protocols, strengthening the international-legal 
base of our bilateral ties. 
  We fully understand the ways of further developing 
Kyrgyz-Russian relations, strengthening cooperation within the 
CIS framework, and coordinating actions on the international 
arena. Cooperation between our foreign ministries, in the 
military-political sphere, and in peacemaking operations has 
been comprehensively developed.... 
  [Shinkarenko] The special relations of trust between Boris 
Yeltsin and Askar Akayev are well known. However, there are 
plenty of problems on which they do not have time to work. 
  [Nanayev] You're right. It would be unjustified to depict 
all aspects of our relations solely in a rosy light. In the 
political sphere a great deal is determined by the leaders of 
the states. Cooperation in other spheres is strongly influenced 
by many factors. This applies particularly to trade and 
economic relations. Production is continuing to decline in both 
countries. The fall in the standard of living of the bulk of the 
population has not yet been halted. Many major enterprises that 
were created to meet all-Union needs, particularly in the 
military-industrial complex, have been left without orders. And 
this means tens of thousands of workers and specialists have 
lost their livelihood. We cannot resolve this problem without 
Russia's aid. 
  In Moscow and Bishkek there is shared understanding of the 
difficulties that have arisen. For instance, an accord has been 
secured on Russia providing credit and on the creation of an 
investment fund and joint production units, including some based 
on defense enterprises capable of producing output that Russia 
also needs. However, the accords are slow to be implemented. 
  But there have been improvements here, too. Both in 
Kyrgyzstan and in Russia it has proved possible to bring down 
inflation considerably. The national currency is being 
strengthened.... Thus light can already be seen at the end of 
the tunnel. 
  [Shinkarenko] Many people in Russia are talking about the 
difficulties that have beset Russian-speaking residents of the 
former Soviet republics and about a Russian exodus. How are 
things in Kyrgyzstan? 
  [Nanayev] Following the breakup of the USSR the fate of 
their compatriots became a pressing matter for virtually all the 
former Soviet republics. Like homing pigeons many people 
reached out for their historic roots and origins -- and that is 
quite natural. The instinct of self-preservation is always the 
first to come into play in critical situations, but there is 
also a countermovement. Raisa Fedorovna Kazanina, who now lives 
in Volgograd, wrote recently to a Bishkek newspaper that she is 
homesick for Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan], which she considers her 
second home. She wrote that only illness prevents her from 
returning home. 
  Our president is fully determined to support this endeavor 
on 
the part of the country's Russian-speaking citizens and create 
favorable living and working conditions for them, and thus halt 
migration. The Republic has formulated a concrete action 
program. It has been discussed with the Russian president and is 
bolstered by corresponding measures on both sides. 
  But people have spiritual as well as material needs. In 
particular, a great deal has been done to ensure that the 
Russian language continues to operate in the Republic as before 
and the interests of the Russian-speaking population are not 
infringed upon. In 1993 a Slav University where teaching is 
conducted in Russian opened in Bishkek. Funding of the 
university's activity is shared by Kyrgyzstan and Russia. 
  There are, of course, many farfetched fears and prejudices 
in 
the sphere of interethnic relations, and the Republic's 
leadership is doing everything it can to dispel them. For 
instance, a reasonable approach has been found with Russia to 
the so-called dual citizenship problem. I think that this 
solution will prove quite acceptable to all the Republic's 
inhabitants. 
  [Shinkarenko] Are there any other events or things that you 
would like to point out on the eve of the treaty's second 
anniversary? 
  [Nanayev] First, President Askar Akayev's official visit to 
Moscow in February, his meeting with President Boris Yeltsin. 
During this summit they discussed the most topical problems in 
our contacts, including the sphere of credit and financial 
relations, the prospects for the creation of joint ventures, the 
position of Russian-speaking residents, ways of strengthening 
the CIS, and promoting a settlement in Tajikistan. 
  I cannot help but underline the following. During the 
difficult days this spring a number of regions of the Republic 
were beset by gigantic landslides (mountain torrents). Dozens 
of people died and the country sustained tremendous material 
damage. The Russians, the relevant services of the Russian 
Federation Ministry for Affairs of Civil Defense, Emergency 
Situations, and Elimination of Natural Disasters were the first 
to respond to the disaster. Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of 
Russia's Federation Council, visited the scene of the disaster. 
  Lastly, here is another interesting point. We are currently 
preparing for a major event -- the Chuy Valley Days in Moscow 
Oblast. This festival is in return for a visit that we were 
paid by a delegation from Moscow Oblast. This event, as it may 
appear, is of by no means local significance and does not date 
from the time of stagnation. Familiarization with our friends' 
affairs shows that in the new conditions, our people still have 
a tremendous need for contacts with one another and have similar 
interests and aspirations. The Chuy Valley Workers' Cultural 
Days coincide with the second anniversary of the Treaty of 
Friendship and in this respect are particularly symbolic. 
  [Shinkarenko] Good news and positive emotions are always 
beneficial. But what particularly alarms you today, Mr. 
Ambassador? 
  [Nanayev] By the strictest criteria, apart from the 
difficulties that I have already mentioned, I do not foresee any 
difficulties in either the short or the long term. On the 
contrary, there is reason to think that our relations will 
continue growing and bear increasingly rich fruit. But one must 
not forget that these are relations between real partners linked 
by thousands of strands. And, as you know, there have always 
been, are, and regrettably will remain problems in our affairs 
that we must work on, especially now, when our countries are in 
the throes of a profound economic crisis. But unraveling these 
"knots" is a matter for the political leadership and for us 
diplomats.

  [Text] Dushanbe 8 June TASS -- "Full merger of the Russian 
and Tajik monetary systems can be achieved no sooner than by the 
end of this year," said Tajik Economics and Planning Minister, 
Rustam Mirzoyev, in an interview with ITAR-TASS. Mirzoyev 
pointed out that not only a political decision to this effect 
was adopted by the heads of the two countries, but a package of 
documents, concerning the second stage of the merger, was worked 
out and submitted to Russian colleagues. 
  The minister pointed out that there are no serious opponents 
to the unification of the two monetary systems either in Russia, 
or in Tajikistan. The process of the monetary merger is very 
complex both technically and organizationally, he said. At the 
same time, Tajik manufacturers should work hard to step up the 
process. It is necessary to earn Russian roubles ourselves by 
increasing supplies of industrial products and raw materials, 
i.e. to give priority in exports policy to Russia, the Tajik 
minister said. 
  According to Mirzoyev, Tajikistan faces severe cash 
shortages 
and the government is 170 billion roubles in debt to the 
population. The remaining 25 billion roubles expected to arrive 
from Russia as part of the 120-billion credit to Tajikistan will 
not be enough even to pay pensions and social allowances, he 
said. 
  Asked by ITAR-TASS if Tajikistan intends to introduce 
temporary money for internal payments, the minister declined to 
answer, saying that such problems are in the competence of the 
Tajik parliament.

  [Text] Yerevan ("LRAGIR", "AZG" Dailies, Past), 06/07/94 -- 
Special Envoy of the Russian President Vladimir Kazimirov has 
visited Baku, Yerevan and Stepanakert, negotiating with the 
sides regarding the new Russian peace project. He reported to a 
"TURAN" correspondent, they are trying to find formulations and 
topics based on mutual concessions. 
  According to Kazimirov, maximalist aspirations of both sides 
are not supportive to the progress, since the other side would 
clearly not accept them. "Unfortunately, the sides are not used 
to trade yet, but are fixed on their demands", said Russian 
President's Envoy. 
  Kazimirov noted the haste of the Azeri side, which is not 
supportive for successful solutions. "In order to start 
withdrawal of troops from the occupied territories, we should 
not waste days and weeks but we should reach a Great political 
agreement", noted Kazimirov. He also referred to stationing 
peace-making forces and said they would be something inbetween 
peace-making troops and observers. "This forces wouldn't have 
disengagement functions", he noted, "these are observers with 
corresponding control and security bodies." According to 
Kazimirov, their structure is not defined yet, but financing 
will be shared equally by the three sides. 
  Kazimirov said that the Azeri side made a proposal on 
liberating Shushi and Lachin, but this problems should be 
discussed only in two weeks after the current agreement is 
signed. 
  Russian President's Special Envoy criticized Karabakh's 
demand of "status against territories", saying this is an 
attempt of resolving the problem by force. 
  Having finished the negotiations in Baku, Kazimirov arrived 
to Yerevan late in the evening on June 4, and met his Armenian 
counterpart Davit Shakhnazaryan. The sides have been 
negotiating on several topics of the Russian project on peaceful 
resolution of the Karabakh problem. 
  RA [Republic of Armenia] President Levon Ter-Petrosyan met 
Kazimirov on June 5. On the same day Russian President's Envoy 
left for Stepanakert. 
  Kazimirov met Chairman of the RMK [Republic of Mountainous 
Karabakh] State Department of Defense Robert Kocharyan and the 
RMK Foreign Minister Arkadiy Gukasyan. The sides discussed 
problems relating to peaceful resolution of the Karabakh 
conflict and the recent Russian project. The RMK leaders 
expressed their worries about the non-constructive stance of 
Azerbaijan, which rejects the peace projects one after another. 
Kazimirov left Stepanakert on June 6.

<F P=106> [Report by Gulsafa Ahmedova from a meeting between President </F>
Geydar Aliyev and UK Ambassador to Azerbaijan Thomas Young in 
Baku on 7 Jun--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Ahmedova] Republic President Geydar Aliyev 
today received UK Ambassador to Azerbaijan Thomas Young at the 
latter's request. During the meeting, the ambassador presented 
to Geydar Aliyev a number of photographs that reminded the 
president of his contacts in London. 
  In reminding him that the birthday of Queen Elizabeth II has 
coincided with such a pleasant occasion, the Azerbaijani 
president conveyed his sincere wishes to the UK people. 
  [Aliyev] Today is the birthday of your queen. I have sent a 
letter of congratulations to the queen of Great Britain. Our 
meeting fell on this day. You had requested a meeting some days 
ago. Unfortunately, I had no opportunity, and maybe it was good 
that the meeting took place on the queen's birthday. I 
congratulate you; please convey my congratulations to the 
esteemed queen, and wish happiness and peace to your country and 
people. 
  [Young, in English with interpreter providing Azeri 
translation] I have received your letter of congratulations. We 
have sent it to the queen. I know that she will be most 
grateful for your good wishes. It is an indication of, I think, 
of the closeness between Azerbaijan and the UK that your own 
national day, the 28th of May, is separated by a small period of 
10 days from our own national day. I think we should work in 
future to bring the dates even closer together. If I may say, 
Mr. President, I was most grateful for the welcome and 
hospitality you gave to [UK Minister of Energy] Mr. Tim Eggar 
when he was here two weeks ago. He was very grateful to be 
accommodated in your best house and to be entertained by you 
personally for dinner. He benefited particularly from his 
discussions with you on Nagorno- Karabakh and on the oil 
question. The oil and gas exhibition showed that there are many 
areas where the UK and Azerbaijan can cooperate. [passage 
omitted] 
  You asked Mr. Eggar about discussions between Mr. [Douglas] 
Hurd and Mr. Kozyrev in Russia. They met in both Murmansk and 
in Moscow two weeks ago. Mr. Hurd urged Mr. Kozyrev to 
integrate the Russian peace plan into that of the CSCE. He said 
that the UK Government did not want a separate Russian force 
outside CSCE control. He asked Mr. Kozyrev to make the Russians 
work with [Minsk Group chairman] Eliasson, with Mr. Eliasson, 
and to stop the confusion. The UK Government will continue to 
press for CSCE leadership of the peace effort. I am sure that 
other CSCE members, as well as ourselves, are keeping up 
pressure for CSCE political leadership of this effort. On the 
practical side, Britain is committed to provide a signals unit 
for the CSCE force. And we shall provide other army and 
diplomatic representatives in support of Mr. Eliasson. To 
enable us and the UK Government to work with the latest 
information, I wonder if you can tell me what has been happening 
in Baku in the last few days on this question. 
  [Aliyev] I again thank you for the photographs you gave me. 
They reminded me of my contacts in London and particularly my 
sincere and businesslike talks with your country's prime 
minister, Mr. John Major. I once more indicate that I was 
pleased with those talks. One of the photographs depicts the 
exchange of numerous agreements between Mr. Major and myself. 
The Azerbaijani society and people warmly welcomed the signing 
of these agreements. However, the task of our two countries now 
is to implement these agreements. 
  Our meetings with Mr. Eggar here were also very fruitful 
and beneficial. This [oil] exhibition organized with your 
country's private oil company BP was a major event in 
Azerbaijan's life. I think that this exhibition will help 
develop ties between Azerbaijan and the Western oil companies 
and with firms active in other industrial sectors, specifically 
with UK firms. Therefore, I reiterate my favorable opinion of 
this exhibition and I ask that you inform Mr. Eggar that I was 
very pleased with our meeting. 
  The information you gave me about the meeting between Mr. 
Hurd and Kozyrev in Murmansk is of great interest to me. The 
principled stance of the UK on this important problem will 
greatly help in its solution. The continued support to be given 
on this issue by the UK to the Minsk Group, and to Jan Eliasson 
personally, I hope will, as you already indicated, help stop the 
war between Azerbaijan and Armenia and peacefully settle the 
Karabakh problem. Therefore, send my regards to Mr. Douglas 
Hurd. I now recall my very substantive and fruitful meetings 
with him in London. I would like you inform him that I would 
hope that he continues with his efforts to further develop the 
ties between Azerbaijan and the UK on the basis of our London 
talks and particularly to extricate Azerbaijan from its present 
war condition. I believe that after my visit to your country, 
to London, ties between Azerbaijan and the UK are developing 
quite fast. I invited Mr. Major and Mr. Douglas Hurd to 
Azerbaijan. I hope with your effort these invitations will 
materialize. Cooperation on oil between Azerbaijan and the UK 
has a great future. As you already noted, there is also 
favorable opportunities for cooperation in other fields, with 
other firms such as (?Kaizerin) Engineering Company, (?GBP) in 
the communications sector, and in aluminum production. 
  I want to inform you again that I will personally take the 
necessary measures to develop these economic ties. 
  I also want to say a few words on the continuing talks on 
cooperation in the oil sector between the Western firms and 
Azerbaijan. A regular meeting between the representatives of 
the Azerbaijani state oil company and representatives of the 
Western oil companies opened in Istanbul today. I received the 
representatives of our oil firm two days before their departure 
to Istanbul. We held a detailed discussion. They informed me 
in detail on issues they were going to raise during the upcoming 
talks and received the necessary instructions from me. I hope 
that the talks that opened in Istanbul today will yield very 
positive results. 
  In this connection, I want to draw your attention to a 
problem. Of late, the Western companies felt a certain 
uneasiness in connection with an insignificant incident. You are 
aware that the Russian Foreign Ministry submitted a brief note 
to the UK Embassy in Moscow in connection with our cooperation 
in the oil sector. Purportedly, this note calls for caution on 
this subject because the status of the Caspian Sea has not yet 
been established. However, what I told the reception of the 
heads of the Western firms during the exhibition is that no 
attention should be given to such insignificant information. 
The Azerbaijani oil men have been extracting oil from the 
Caspian basin since 1949. The discovery and exploitation of the 
oil fields in the Caspian sea has a great history, and all this 
is linked to the Azerbaijani oil men and scientists. Therefore, 
no one, no force, no country can deprive us, the Azerbaijani 
Republic and people, from this right. Secondly, so far no 
question of the status of the Caspian sea has been raised. 
There was no such issue on the agenda. If any state has a say 
on the oil extraction by anyone, in this case oil extraction by 
Azerbaijan, in a certain sector of the Caspian, then that state 
should make its views known to Azerbaijan. If the Russian state 
and government has a say or objection on this issue, then it 
should contact Azerbaijan, they have nothing to do with the UK. 
This shows that if there was a really serious matter, a letter 
or note would have been sent to Azerbaijan. No such note or 
letter has come to Azerbaijan. In addition, I can say that 
Russia's Lukoil firm is participating in our consortium. We 
consented to its participation. That is, we included it in the 
consortium because it concluded an agreement with us. The 
essence of this is that the oil fields in these sectors belong 
to Azerbaijan, and Azerbaijan has sovereignty over them. 
  Despite all this, seeing that certain firms are somewhat 
uneasy, I held a telephone conversation with Russian Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on 31 May. I informed him that the 
Russian Foreign Ministry--actually I have seen that note and it 
had no signature-- has taken such an action. Russian Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin informed me that he had no 
knowledge about this affair and that the Russian Government had 
no such problem, that the status of the Caspian is on the agenda 
of neither Russia nor other countries. He informed me that 
Azerbaijan's oil fields in the Caspian basin are known to 
Russia, and we know that Azerbaijan is exploiting its own oil 
fields and is holding talks with the Western firms for their 
future exploitation. Therefore, he told me that Russia had no 
problem on this issue. He told me that I could officially 
announce this in the name of the [Russian] prime minister. 
  I instructed Natik Aliyev, president of the Azerbaijani 
state 
oil company, to formally announce this statement of the Russian 
prime minister during the Istanbul meeting today, and to declare 
that this is the view of the head of the Russian Government. 
However, it is not known who wrote that note, maybe it was 
anonymous. 
  In giving this information to you, I hope that you will 
inform London, your government, and your Foreign Ministry about 
this. I want to repeat that there is no reason for concern on 
this issue. We are going ahead with our own work and we are 
continuing the talks with the Western oil companies. I repeat 
that I have instructed our delegation to see that the talks lead 
to the signing of the contract.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 7 Jun -- So far not a single subunit of the 
CIS or the UN peacekeeping forces has entered Abkhaz territory. 
Some media reports that such subunits have started to arrive at 
the Georgian-Abkhaz line of confrontation are not true. The 
ITAR-TASS correspondent has learned this at the press office of 
the Abkhaz Supreme Soviet today. 
  As everyone knows, the legislative bodies of the CIS states 
have not yet made any decision on the introduction of 
peacekeeping forces into the zone of conflict. 
  In accordance with the Georgian-Abkhaz agreements on a 
cease-fire and separation of the forces, which were signed in 
Moscow on 14 May, the peacekeeping forces will be deployed in 
the 12-kilometer-long strip of the security zone. The agreement 
also provides for the opposing sides to deploy armed formations, 
except for heavy combat machinery, in the zone where a limited 
range of arms is permitted. The peacekeeping forces will be 
expected to patrol the Kodor gorge as well. 
  As the press office has noted, following the arrival of the 
peacekeeping forces, the UN observers can leave the security 
zone, if necessary, provided they agree on this with the leaders 
of the opposing sides. 
  [Tbilisi CONTACT INFORMATION AGENCY in Russian at 1310 GMT 
on 
7 June carries a similar report stating the following: "Russian 
mass media reported today, quoting Abkhaz sources, that the 
deployment of CIS peacekeeping forces in the conflict zone in 
Abkhazia has already begun. However, this was not confirmed by 
the Georgian Defense Ministry."]

<F P=106> [Unattributed NEGA report in the "Georgia" column] </F>
  [Text] On 12 June elections to the Georgian republic 
parliament will be held in another three hitherto explosive 
areas of western Georgia -- Zugdidi, Tsalendzhik, and 
Tskhorotskusk. Each district will elect one deputy. (In 
October 1992, when Georgia-wide parliamentary elections were 
held, they did not take place in these areas owing to a 
complicated sociopolitical situation. At that time the 
districts were controlled by armed supporters of Zviad 
Gamsakhurdia). 
  Among the six deputies running for one seat in the Zugdidi 
district is Georgian Prime Minister Otari Patsatsiya. Born in 
Zugdidi, he held responsible economic and state posts in the 
district for several years. Many observers believe that Otari 
Patsatsiya will win these elections in the Zugdidi district, 
where his efforts to stabilize the situation in November 1993 
are well remembered. 
  On 12 June, elections will also take place in the city of 
Rustavi in eastern Georgia. Zhiuli Shartava, Georgian 
parliament deputy from this city, was assassinated on 27 
September 1993 by Abkhaz militants during the storming of 
Sukhumi. At the time he was chairman of the Council of 
Ministers of the Abkhaz Autonomous Republic. 
  Generally, the issue of elections in Georgia is very acute. 
Some political parties propose that early parliamentary 
elections be held, considering it important to renew the 
parliament composition. Other parties believe that there is no 
need to hold elections to the Georgian parliament until 
Georgia's jurisdiction has been established over the territory 
of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladislav Ardzinba, chairman of the </F>
Abkhazian Supreme Council, by HOLOS UKRAYINY special 
correspondent Lyudmyla Kokhanets in Abkhazia; date not given: 
"We Were Ready To Die in Order To Live" -- first paragraph 
published in a box] 
  [Text] The Chairman of the Abkhazian Supreme Council 
Vladislav Ardzinba is 48 years old. In the West, he is 
considered to be a sensational politician. He is 
historian-ethnographer by profession and an expert in ancient 
history, doctor of historical sciences. Incidentally, he also 
heads the Abkhazian Institute of History, Ethnography, Language, 
and Literature. In fact, the institute no longer exists: 
During the time of the war, its building and the extremely rich 
resources were almost completely destroyed. 
  [Kokhanets] They say that history repeats itself: First as 
a tragedy and then -- as a farce. What we see in Abkhazia 
indicates that history has repeated itself as a tragedy. From 
the point of view of a historian, why, do you think, the past 
has not taught people anything and why could the tragic analogy 
not be avoided? 
  [Ardzinba] History did, in fact, repeat itself in Abkhazia. 
A similar situation took shape in May 1918, right after the 
Georgian Democratic Republic was created. Its troops occupied 
our land, and the occupation lasted until 1925, when the 
sovereign Soviet Socialist Republic of Abkhazia was born. Then 
there was the year 1992. The Georgian invaders again want to 
teach the unruly Abkhazians a lesson with their weapons and 
remind them, at gun point, that they are "not a people, but an 
ethnic minority," so they should not press for rights. It is 
true that, this time, the "reminding" with tanks did not last 
too long -- just one year. Why does history not teach people 
anything? Perhaps because a new generation is growing up, a 
generation that has a poor knowledge of history and which was 
brought up in the atmosphere of the propaganda asserting that 
Abkhazia has always been an integral part of Georgia. As you can 
see, there is nothing original about the style of our "big 
brothers." 
  [Kokhanets] Excuse my poor knowledge of history, but the 
majority of our people draw an analogy between Abkhazia and the 
Crimea and not between Abkhazia and Ukraine.... 
  [Ardzinba] They are deeply mistaken. One should not accuse 
a people that has a long history of statehood, of separatism. 
Back in the sixth century, the early feudal principalities of 
Abkhazians, Apsylians [apsyly], and other Abkhazian tribes 
united into the Abkhazian Kingdom with Leon I at the head. 
Following the dynasty marriage between Leon I and daughter of 
Georgian King Mirian, who found asylum in Abkhazia after 
escaping from the persecution by cruel Murvan "the Deaf," the 
kingdom also included lands of the present western Georgia. One 
thinks sometimes that had Leon I known what that noble gesture 
would cause to his descendants, he would not have been in any 
hurry to warmly hug the persecuted neighbor.... However, these 
are lyrical digressions. If one proceeds from historical 
scientific facts, the assertion that "Abkhazia has always been 
an integral part of Georgia" only makes one wonder how competent 
its authors are. 
  Of course, there has been much in the long history of our 
mutual relations: Joint struggle against various conquerors and 
confrontation. However, I will not burden you with lessons in 
Abkhazian history. I will say one thing: When somebody tries 
to suppress a people, the latter develops immunity to that 
force. This is confirmed by facts of recent history. During 
the last decades of the existence of the [Soviet] Union, 
Abkhazia remained one of the most turbulent regions. 
Practically every decade, there used to be mass popular unrest: 
Abkhazians painfully reacted to the suppression of their 
national culture and language, mass resettlement, and 
destruction of the national elite. The well- tested method that 
Stalin and Beria had used to deal with the hated people -- 
assimilation -- nearly destroyed our people's roots, but when 
there appeared tanks on the streets, the patience of the 
Abkhazians was exhausted. They achieved freedom and 
independence. You know, in many Abkhazian families, people even 
raise toasts to invaders: Thanks for waking us up.... 
  [Kokhanets] The Georgian-Abkhazian conflict is looked upon 
as a war of Christianity against Islam. 
  [Ardzinba] This is ridiculous. Abkhazia is one of the 
oldest Christian countries: The spread of the Christian 
religion to our land started as early as the second century. At 
present, Orthodox faith and Catholicism develop very actively in 
our country. There is a synagogue and a Buddhist temple, 
but..., unfortunately, not a single mosque. This is Islamic 
expansion for you. I used the word "unfortunately," because I 
believe that in any civilized society, all religious faiths must 
coexist, and people must decide for themselves where to pray to 
the Creator. 
  [Kokhanets] There exists a medical notion -- "the narrowing 
down of consciousness." A person becomes fixed on a certain 
thought or action and does not perceive anything beyond that. 
War is also characterized by the "narrowing down of 
consciousness." What do you think was the reason for the 
"disease" in those who raised weapons against civilians? I 
looked through the chronicle of the first days of the war -- 
bullets fell on beaches and streets of the town.... Not only 
Abkhazians perished.... 
  [Ardzinba] Not only. The war unleashed by Tbilisi was not 
only a crime against the Abkhazian people, but also against 
other people residing here, especially against those Georgians 
who lived in Abkhazia. The cause of the "disease" is known, we 
have already discussed it with you: Massive propaganda imposed 
upon Georgians over many years: Abkhazia is ours and Abkhazians 
are also Georgians, but only second-rate ones. When one is 
exposed to the hypnotic action of such propaganda, one tends to 
develop such a "narrowing down of the consciousness." 
  [Kokhanets] Another version of the reason for Tbilisi's 
conflicts with its autonomous republics is the following: As 
soon as a war among Georgians themselves starts in Georgia, the 
cunning politicians transfer the center of tension to provinces 
-- Abkhazia, Adzharia, or South Ossetia. It is as though the 
march on Abkhazia was an attempt on the part of Tbilisi to 
quench the fire of its own civil war with the gasoline of the 
Abkhazian conflict. Do you agree with such a version? 
  [Ardzinba] I believe that this is one of the main reasons 
why Georgian troops were sent to Abkhazia. Every time, when it 
is necessary to distract the people's attention from the 
internal political struggle, a slogan is put forward: 
"Everybody get ready to march on...." This can even be 
followed by numerous examples of the recent period. I think 
that, with a sensible approach, it was possible to avoid 
bloodshed both in South Ossetia and in Abkhazia. This is also 
possible today, if the leaders had enough courage to tell their 
own people the truth. 
  [Kokhanets] Do you believe in such courage? 
  [Ardzinba] You know what particularly disturbed me during 
this war? That there was not a single person who would question 
the need to bring troops to the territory of unarmed Abkhazia as 
a just settlement of tension in our relations. Not a single 
voice, can you imagine? Not a single protest -- what are you 
doing, stop! That aggressive silence simply killed me. 
However, this is perhaps the state of our society. The events 
that recently took place on the territory of Georgia, once again 
confirm this distressing diagnosis. A president was elected in 
Georgia -- whether good or bad is another question. I am not, 
personally, a supporter of Gamsakhurdia. However, he was elected 
by the people, and he should have been deposed in a lawful 
manner. Instead, a coup d'etat took place. Its main initiator 
was, of course, Shevardnadze, who seemed to have found himself 
on the fringes of politics, but did not lose strength. As a 
result of that coup, Shevardnadze came to power in an iniquitous 
way. Yet, the international community recognized it as a lawful 
procedure and enabled Eduard Amvrosiyevich [Shevardnadze] to 
conclude that he could clear his path toward the goal by force. 
That force showed itself in Abkhazia. 
  [Kokhanets] Did it not occur to you, when you saw tanks on 
the streets of Sukhumi, that Shevardnadze could not, on his own, 
adopt the decision to bring in troops? 
  [Ardzinba] No, it did not. I am convinced that he had 
received full consent to that. Obviously, leaders of the most 
powerful states had discussed that issue. I can assume that 
Shevardnadze had assured them that the troops were brought in to 
guard the railroad and they pretended that they believed him. 
So he did not have to wait too long for permission. We are not 
naive: We understand very well that one phone call was 
sufficient to halt the tanks. Judging by everything, there was 
no such call. On that day, 14 August 1992, I tried to get 
through to Tbilisi, but nobody picked up the receiver. I 
realized that the "big brothers" were demonstrating: Abkhazia 
is a graphic example of how others will be punished if they 
contemplate seceding with their age-old territory. 
  Shevardnadze later asserted that the Abkhazian leadership 
and 
I in particular had given permission to bring in the troops. 
This is blasphemy. The day before, on the 13th, when we 
learned that the troops of the State Council were heading for 
Mingrelia, I telephoned the Georgian leader and asked him what 
was the purpose of that and whether the tanks would proceed 
further to Abkhazia. Mr. Shevardnadze assured me: No, by no 
means! On the 14th, the tanks appeared on our streets. 
  [Kokhanets] The state of transition from peace to war is 
accompanied by the feeling of irrationality in what is going on. 
I felt that throughout the week of my stay in the land, where 
there only remain traces of war. What I see around me is 
incomprehensible. Where is that boundary between war and peace? 
  [Ardzinba] One can only comprehend and feel this in full 
measure if one experiences all of this. When we look back to 
August 1992, we realize how naive we were. I remember a 
colleague of mine tell his family by telephone: Stay at home, 
do not go into the street, they will not come to the house.... 
Awful. We still hoped that it was possible to come to an 
agreement through negotiations, that it was possible to convince 
them: Take away your troops and tanks. Unfortunately, too 
late, only after we became sure that those people had come to 
kill us and kill us in our own homes, did we proceed to active 
defense. We had no other alternative. That process of 
transition from the state of peace to war was very difficult. 
However, I admit, the opposite process -- from the state of war 
to peace -- was even more difficult. 
  [Kokhanets] With whom, on the other side, do you think it is 
possible to hold a dialogue? To whom is it possible to turn, at 
a simple human level, for informal conciliation -- Georgia, for 
example, has always been famous for its wise intellectuals. 
  [Ardzinba] We are ready to talk with anyone who looks at 
things soberly and is prepared to critically analyze everything 
that happened. Unfortunately, I do not see signs of growing 
sobriety. If only their leaders tried to tell the truth -- not 
to us, but to their own people that the bringing in of troops 
and the war that was unleashed were a mistake and that they are 
ready to take the responsibility upon themselves. Attempts to 
mislead everybody are continuing. This is also attested to by 
Eduard Shevardnadze's last speech at the UN Security Council 
session. Again the same crafty political tricks: We guarded 
the railroad, we fought against terrorists.... It is impossible 
to conduct a policy through deception. Although I am sure that, 
deep in his heart, the Georgian leader realizes that he 
miscalculated. 
  As regards intellectuals.... I am sure that such people 
exist. I know them. However, I would not like to name them, as 
I do not want to bring disaster upon them. The only way to save 
the hurt ambition of the Georgian people is, I reiterate, to 
tell them the truth. 
  [Kokhanets] In Tbilisi, I met with refugees from Abkhazia. 
It was difficult for many of them to grasp the truth -- they 
tell of terrible things -- torture, persecution, and murder of 
women and children. Just recall at least the forced escape 
through the snow- covered mountains of Svanetia.... 
  [Ardzinba] Unfortunately, war is always associated with 
violations of human rights and with large numbers of innocent 
victims. I could quote thousands of cases of similar violations 
of human rights by our adversary. Besides, the Georgian side is 
deliberately stirring up passions. You were probably told about 
mass atrocities at the stadium in Gagry, about dismembered 
corpses and severed heads.... People do not know that, at the 
worst time of the war, we sent our soldiers to guard Georgian 
villages, so that nobody would try to take revenge upon the 
population for the relatives who had been murdered. One more 
fact. Whereas during the war, Abkhazians could not speak their 
native language in the street for fear of death, just go to the 
market place today -- Georgians freely sell their merchandise 
there, and they work in the town and speak Georgian, and nobody 
threatens them with death for that. One must simply stop being 
biased and try to understand that if, some day, tanks had 
entered Tbilisi, Georgians would have reacted in exactly the 
same way. Of course, there are incidents of persecution against 
Georgians. It would be a lie to deny this. However, 
authorities decisively condemn this. Dozens of criminal cases 
have been initiated in our country to investigate facts of 
violation of human rights. Even sentences have already been 
announced -- the death penalty. 
  [Kokhanets] Does the fact that individual UNSO [Ukrainian 
National Self-Defense] fighters participated in the war on the 
Georgian side affect your attitude toward Ukraine? 
  [Ardzinba] Ukraine is a great power, and we should not spoil 
relations with it on the basis of just one fact. I think that, 
by fighting for the territorial integrity of Georgia, the UNSO 
members did not antagonize Russia, but supported its imperial 
encroachments upon Ukraine. However, forget about them.... 
  Representatives of Western powers told me that in Geneva an 
organization exists called "Friends of Georgia," which is 
represented by the most powerful world powers. Is it really a 
worthy occupation for the whole world to fight against such a 
small people? On the contrary, it must be protected. Moreover, 
if somebody really wants good for Georgia and strives to play 
the role of a peace-keeper, let him create the committee 
"Friends of Georgia and Abkhazia." This will really be a 
struggle for establishing peace in the Caucasus. However.... 
Unfortunately, the one-sided position still marks international 
diplomacy. 
  We are interested in developing most friendly relations with 
Ukraine. There are two sanatoriums on the territory of Abkhazia 
and they will continue to be the property of Ukraine. Let your 
people come and have rest in our country. Tension will not 
prevail here forever. Ukraine provided humanitarian aid for us, 
and we will always be grateful for that to its great and 
beautiful people. 
  [Kokhanets] Things are clear with Ukraine. How can you 
comment upon the statements by the Georgian side to the effect 
that Russia helped Abkhazia win this war? 
  [Ardzinba] I think that this is the fantasy of the Georgian 
politicians, who are ashamed to admit that small Abkhazia 
defeated them. The defeat from strong Russia is much less 
painful for their pride. On the contrary, one of the reasons 
for unleashing the war was the fact that, in accordance with the 
Tashkent agreement, Russia transferred to Tbilisi those weapons 
that had been deployed on the territory of Georgia (this was 
forbidden with regard to those countries where there were 
interethnic conflicts). When Tbilisi acquired tanks, aviation, 
and artillery -- and there was an unarmed people nearby -- it 
was difficult to resist the temptation to resolve all problems 
by armed force. Therefore those who gave the weapons to the 
aggressor bear much of the responsibility. 
  Of course, there are different forces in Russia. I am 
convinced that the people are very well disposed toward us. 
With regard to leaders, I will not make a secret out of the 
fact that there are forces interested in maintaining tension in 
Abkhazia. We know what these forces are. 
  We have two alternative ways: Abkhazia's complete 
independence and a possible search for compromise with Georgia. 
However, we will not allow our further relations to be based 
upon the principle of relations between the center and a colony. 
Of course, this must be discussed at a negotiating table and, 
possibly, through a referendum, but not by pressure or physical 
annihilation. 
  [Kokhanets] You are speaking about the possibility of a 
referendum? 
  [Ardzinba] Yes. The main form for determining our future is 
through studying public opinion. However, now, we cannot hold a 
referendum: That part of the Georgian population, which, in 
accordance with the agreement, must return to the territory of 
Abkhazia, has not yet returned. All those people who did not 
fight against us, did not kill Abkhazians, and did not plunder 
our homes, will have such a possibility. 
  [Kokhanets] What are the criteria for determining guilt or 
innocence? 
  [Ardzinba] In the course of military actions, we seized 
lists of those who had belonged to armed formations of Georgians 
and participated in the war on the Georgian side (many 
Georgians, like also, incidentally, local Ukrainians, fought on 
the Abkhazian side). We have testimonies of victims and a whole 
card-index of documents and statements. Of course, the gate on 
the Inguri [River] will not be opened to war criminals or 
bandits. 
  [Kokhanets] Do you have problems with Abkhazia's Russian- 
speaking population? 
  [Ardzinba] Unfortunately, we do. Quite a number. 
Incidentally, when Russia declared its economic blockade of 
Abkhazia, this primarily affected local Russians. In words, the 
present Moscow politicians promote the protection of Russians 
throughout the world, but in fact, they do everything so that 
those Russians have problems. 
  [Kokhanets] I will ask you an indiscreet question, Vladislav 
Grigoryevich. During these days, I became convinced that the 
people -- from the very old to toddlers -- love you very much: 
Without exaggeration, they almost idolize you. Will not yet 
another personality cult result from such nationwide adoration? 
Are you not alerted by this? 
  [Ardzinba] Perhaps much depends upon the person. However, 
you exaggerate about nationwide adoration. Even if it had been, 
it is possible to avoid the personality cult: It is very 
important to build the structure of the state apparatus in such 
a way that the people would be able to control any power. It 
seems to me that this is precisely what will happen in our 
country. I will tell you honestly, I am not afraid of creating 
my own cult, because it is not supreme power or omnipotence that 
I am dreaming about, but my return to the Institute of History, 
Language, and Literature. My place and my destiny are there. I 
will, in every way, take advantage of favorable circumstances in 
order to go back to my favorite occupation.... 
  [Kokhanets] Tell me, are you afraid of death? 
  [Ardzinba] Simply stated, during the time of the war I 
became convinced that life is much better. We were ready to die 
in order to live.

  [Text] Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin said 
at a news conference, which he gave before departing from 
Tallinn today, that he is very pleased with the present 
atmosphere of talks and that goodwill on the Estonian side was 
much in evidence. In addition to talks with Raul Malk, the 
Estonian Foreign Ministry's deputy chancellor, Churkin had a 
meeting yesterday [7 June] with President Lennart Meri and 
Foreign Minister Juri Luik. 
  Churkin opined that both parties genuinely wish to resolve 
all the problems as quickly as possible in order to close a 
chapter in Estonian-Russian relations and open a new one. 
Taking into account the agreements reached in the course of 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's visit to Tallinn at 
the end of May, Churkin thought that talks are nearing the 
finishing line. 
  The next meeting between Churkin and Malk will evidently 
take 
place next week in Moscow.

  [Text] Go-between in controversial $60 million arms deal 
between Estonia and TAAS Israel Industries Ltd., Leonid 
Apananski, had in 1992 sponsored the election campaign of three 
prominent members of the ruling Fatherland Party, former Defence 
Minister Indrek Kannik told the Estonian Radio on Tuesday. 
Kannik said Apananski had sponsored present Foreign Minister 
Juri Luik, MP Mart Nutt and himself with 9,000 kroons ($692). 
  "I am sorry that those documents from Fatherlandos 
election-time archive should have come out now," Kannik said 
while adding that the archives had stayed with Tiit Pruuli, the 
former adviser to Prime Minister Mart Laar. Kannik also said 
Laar and Pruuli had advised them to ask Apananski for campaign 
funds. Kannik's interview came a day after MP Aivar Kala had 
accused Kannik of accepting Apananski's funds.

  [Text] Tallinn, June 06, BNS -- The problems in the field 
of textiles connected with a free-trade agreement between 
Estonia and the European Union remain unsettled, Foreign 
Ministry Chancellor Priit Kolbre, who led the Estonian 
delegation at the latest round of talks in Brussels June 2-3, 
said at a press conference in Tallinn today. 
  Kolbre said the talks proceeded in the fishing, farming, 
customs and textile groups, and that the plenary session 
discussed the basic text of the free-trade agreement and 
problems concerning the working groups. "We took a long step 
forward, but failed to wind up the negotiations," he said, 
adding that big problems persisted in textile issues. 
  Signe Ratso, the deputy head of the Economics Ministry 
foreign trade department, told reporters Estonia's opposition to 
a double control system was the stumbling block. The European 
Union wants Estonia to introduce a license system to establish 
control over the export of clothing and textiles, whereas the 
Baltic nation claims licenses are inconsistent with its 
principles of liberalization of trade and cause considerable 
expense to both the state and enterprises. 
  The fishing group, on the other hand, made good progress, 
Director General Lauri Vaarja of the Fishing Administration 
reported. Estonia was able to justify the need for bigger 
import quotas than those offered by the European Union. 
  Agriculture Ministry Deputy Chancellor Ruve Sank said the 
rules for applying farming produce quotas exclude Estonian 
enterprises from the European Union market and they can market 
their produce in Europe only through local companies. The 
meeting reached agreement on increasing the quotas for some 
goods, including cheese and alcohol. 
  The customs group focused on rules of origin. Here, too, 
some problems remained open. Estonia proposed changes in rules 
applied to coffee, cigarettes, and handpainted porcelain and 
silk. Agreement was reached on coffee but not on cigarettes. 
The reply on rules of origin for handicrafts will be 
forthcoming in the next few weeks. 
  The working groups of the two sides coordinated the general 
principles of a bilateral free-trade agreement in February. It 
has been agreed in principle that the agreement steps into force 
at the beginning of the next year. Unlike Latvia and Lithuania, 
Estonia's agreement with the European Union is not going to 
provide for a transition period.

electoral commission to determine that candidate deputy of the 
Way of Latvia union who would assume the place of Andrejevs. I

of minister of foreign affairs since 10 November 1992.

  [Excerpt] In the Latvian sea resort of Jurmala on Tuesday, 
the Lithuanian and Latvian prime ministers, Adolfas Slezevicius 
and Valdis Birkavs, discussed border delimitation issues. 
Pollution of the sea border with Latvia is a very sensitive 
point, which is related to the construction of an oil terminal 
on the Baltic Sea coast. The two prime ministers also dealt 
with issues of the export and import of farming produce, 
population, and environmental protection, as well as between the 
parliaments and governments of the two states. 
  Unofficial sources say that if Latvia's position on the sea 
border is not acceptable to Lithuania, Prime Minister Adolfas 
Slezevicius is not going to sign any agreement on that issue. 
  Also on Tuesday, the negotiating delegations of Lithuania 
and 
Russia opened a new round of talks. Two expert groups 
coordinated their positions on the issue of border checkpoints 
between Lithuania and the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. Three 
transit points are planned to be opened; one of these in Nida in 
[words indistinct], a narrow strip of land jutting out into the 
Baltic Sea north of the Kaliningrad Region, and as far as the 
Lithuanian sea port of Klaipeda. Another two border crossing 
points of [words indistinct] will be used only by citizens of 
Lithuania and Russia. [passage omitted]

    [Editorial Report] Vilnius Radio Vilnius Network in 
Lithuanian at 0725 GMT on 8 June broadcasts a report on 
Lithuanian Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius' meeting with his 
Latvian counterpart, Valdis Burkavs, in Jurmala, Latvia, 
yesterday. The unidentified correspondent states that the main 
objective of the meeting was to discuss a draft agreement on the 
maritime border and the maritime economic border between Latvia 
and Lithuania. 
  The correspondent goes on to say that the Lithuanian prime 
minister, speaking on Lithuanian radio, said: "We are close to a 
possible agreement. However, I must say that again yesterday we 
failed to adopt the solutions. A 2.5 km economic maritime zone 
with Sweden still remains in dispute. We think that next Monday 
[13 June] we will be able to discuss this issue again." 
  The correspondent motes that the prime minister also said 
that an agreement on the state maritime border will be prepared 
and signed in Tallinn next Monday. Speaking about cooperation 
between the Lithuanian and Latvian customs services, the 
correspondent says, the prime minister said that "the situation 
on the Lithuanian-Latvian border causes concern to everybody. 
The problem can be solved if both sides take a benevolent stand 
on the matter." However, the correspondent adds, he did not 
specify what exactly the problem is that is causing concern. 
  The report ends with the correspondent noting that when the 
prime minister presented his view on the interpolation to his 
government, the prime minister said that "this is an important 
political event in the political life of our country. We regard 
this fact as a constitutional norm, as a normal process," adding 
that the government is prepared to stand its ground and to give 
answers to all the issues raised in parliament next week when 
the vote of no confidence in the government will be discussed.

  [Text] The right to use mandatory deposits by the Ateitis 
and Nida commercial banks was suspended yesterday by the 
Lithuanian Central Bank. This was reported by Egle Valyte, 
press spokesman for the Lithuanian Central Bank. 
  The statement disseminated by the Lithuanian Central Bank 
today stresses that this decision is aimed at protecting the 
interests of the creditors. The decision was made after the 
Lithuanian Central Bank administration made amendments to the 
rules on mandatory reserves of commercial banks on 3 June. The 
use of mandatory reserves deposited at the Lithuanian Central 
Bank are restricted if the banks violate their obligations and 
are not able to settle accounts in full with their creditors. 
  We have already reported that the Apus, Express, and 
Lietukis 
commercial banks had their right to use the mandatory reserves 
suspended by the Administration Board of the Lithuanian Central 
Bank on 3d June.

  [Text] Deputy Finance Minister Mikalay Lisay held a 
meeting with representatives of Belarusian commercial banks. 
The participants in the meeting discussed the implementation of 
the Supreme Soviet Presidium resolution on allocating 400 
billion rubles in credit to the government by commercial banks. 
There are reasons to believe that the above-mentioned 
resolution was met by commercial banks without enthusiasm. Some 
bankers fear that the allocated money can be used for holding an 
election campaign by one of the candidates. Representatives of 
several banks expressed their willingness to allocate credits, 
but the total sum is very small -- less than 10 billion. It is 
expected that the rest of the banks will present their proposals 
regarding this issue on 8 June.

  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 6/6/1994 -- The 9th round of 
Russian-Moldovan negotiations on the status and terms of 14th 
Army's withdrawal will begin tomorrow in Moscow. BASA learned 
from the Defense Ministry Press Secretariat that Nicolae 
Turtureanu, head of the military experts' group of the Moldovan 
delegation, will not take part in the negotiations due to an 
illness. According to some sources from the Defense Ministry, a 
new head of the military experts' group has not been appointed 
yet. Moldovan delegation is headed by Nicolae Osmochescu, prime 
vice minister of foreign affairs. A Dniester delegation is 
taking part in the negotiations. A representative of the 
Moldovan Government stated to BASA that Tiraspol representatives 
by no means can be regarded as a third side in the negotiations. 
"According to an agreement between the Moldovan and Russian 
delegations, Tiraspol was allowed only to be present at the 
negotiations without a right to make statements," said the 
quoted source.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: By Correspondents </F>
Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] If the process of settlement in Trans-Dniestria 
develops favorably, the need to keep Russia's 14th Army there 
will disappear, a member of the Russian delegation to the talks 
with Moldova told INTERFAX on Tuesday [7 June]. 
  According to the diplomat, participants in the ninth round 
of 
talks between Russia and Moldova, which opened in Moscow on 
Tuesday, will focus on issues connected with the status of 
Russia's 14th Army and the time of its withdrawal. 
  The Russian delegation is led by the Ambassador at Large 
Vladimir Kitayev, and the Moldovan by the First Deputy Foreign 
Minister, Nicolae Osmokescu. 
  A document on the legal status of the 14th Army may be 
drafted during the present round of talks, the diplomat said. 
"If events in Trans-Dniestria develop favorably, only purely 
technical problems connected with troops withdrawal will remain 
to be resolved. It's true, though, that such a process may take 
a long time," he said. 
  During the previous round of talks, INTERFAX's interviewee 
said, the Russian side submitted a number of proposals aimed at 
fixing "technically possible times" for the Army's withdrawal. 
"We cannot take our servicemen to the open spaces. Three to 
four years are required to organize the withdrawal of personnel, 
military equipment, ammunition, etc. Properly. As far as we 
can judge, Kishinev agrees with this on the whole," he said. 
  The diplomat drew Interfax's attention to another "extremely 
important aspect." "On 15 May 1993 in Moscow President Boris 
Yeltsin and his Moldovan counterpart, Mircea Snegur, signed a 
joint communique on the need to synchronize the withdrawal of 
Russian troops from Moldova with the process of peaceful 
settlement in Trans-Dniestria," he said. 
  "Lately bilateral contacts on this issue became more 
productive. Besides, a dialogue between Kishinev and Tiraspol is 
gradually taking shape," he said. "It's indicative that the 
Moldovan leadership has postponed the implementation of the bill 
on official language, which served as a detonator of the 
conflict, and rejected the idea of joining Romania." 
  The diplomat drew attention to the circumstance that some 
Moldovan politicians began to speak in favor of giving up the 
principle of synchronization. "It's quite possible that this 
issue will be raised at the present round of talks," he noted. 
  Under the communique of 15 May 1993 Moldova is not in a 
position to abandon the principle of synchronization 
unilaterally. "We believe that such an approach is premature to 
say the least," he concluded.

  [Text] Tiraspol, BASAPRESS, 6/6/1994 -- Today, Tiraspol 
Radio made public the letter written by Colonel Bergman [chief 
of staff of Dniester forces] forwarded to the Russian Defense 
Minister Pavel Grachev. The letter was intercepted by the 
Tiraspol Security. It states that "Dniester faces a crisis 
situation affecting the economy, especially the industry, and 
the state administration. The shortage of cash made the 
revolted citizens take streets demanding the resignation of the 
corrupt government and Russian aliens who are to be blamed of 
people's impoverishment. A lot of employees of administrative 
and juridical organs are resigning. The 14th Army is not able 
to assure them with jobs. It can only morally support them. 
Firm measures taken by us would allow us with minimum effort to 
achieve the awaited settlement of the relations with Moldova. 
Regardless of all my reports on the situation, General Lebed 
[head of 14th Russian Army] refused my requests to take 
measures. Obviously, this is a underestimation of the 
situation." Bergman demands Lebed "the permission to take 
control over the situation in Dniester." Sources from the 
Security Committee say that "it is unlikely that the letter was 
written by Bergman, as its form and style do not correspond to 
the Chancellery norms of the Russian military units." However, 
the same sources say that the signature belongs to Colonel 
Bergman. Colonel Bergman denied that he wrote the letter. He 
called this provocation instigated by the Dniester Security 
Council. He pointed out that "such a letter could not be sent 
to the Russian Defense Minister by avoiding the 14th Army 
command."

  [Text] In Moscow on Tuesday Russia and Moldova began the 
ninth round of their talks on determining the status of Russia's 
14th Army and fixing the time for its withdrawal from 
Trans-Dniestria. The adviser to the president of the 
self-proclaimed Republic of Trans-Dniestria, Stepan Kitsak, is 
taking part in the talks as an observer. 
  Trans-Dniestria's Secretary of State, Valery Litskay, told 
Interfax's correspondent that the status of observer will not 
allow the adviser to Trans-Dniestria's president to interfere in 
the process of talks, but his stand remains unchanged -- the 
14th Army can be withdrawn from Trans-Dniestria only when the 
region's political status is determined. 
  The leaders of Trans-Dniestria believe that the decree 
issued 
by the president of the self-proclaimed republic, Igor Smirnov, 
to place the 14th Army under Trans-Dniestria's jurisdiction will 
not hinder the process of talks; it will only remind members of 
the official delegations that there is a third party. 
  "Solution to this problem will require a lot of time and 
many 
rounds of talks yet. The trouble is that Russia, Moldova and 
Trans-Dniestria are seeking to accomplish different strategic 
tasks. They must join their efforts in the main direction -- 
determine Trans-Dniestria's political status -- and only after 
that begin to speak about withdrawing the 14th Army in concrete 
terms. The talks on removing the Russian army from the area 
will remain just talk without taking a cardinal decision on the 
status of Trans-Dniestria," Litskay told INTERFAX's 
correspondent.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Shalnev report: "President's Directive Signed </F>
But Still No Clarity. Appointments of 20 Russian Ambassadors 
Delayed"] 
  [Text] According to informed sources, the other day 
President Boris Yeltsin signed an internal directive on the 
procedure for appointing and approving Russian ambassadors 
abroad. 
  This process came to a standstill without even starting, 
literally after the entry into effect of the new Russian 
Federation Constitution, whose provisions regarding the 
procedure for appointing ambassadors caused friction in 
relations between the Foreign Ministry and the Federal 
Assembly's international committees, which aspire to the role of 
active participants rather than passive observers of the 
consideration and solution of questions of this kind. The 
Constitution prescribes that appointments are made by the 
president by agreement with the appropriate parliamentary 
committees. The term "by agreement" has become a stumbling 
block: Does it mean that, for example, committees can block a 
particular nomination proposed by the head of state, or is it 
merely the case that the president will acquaint himself with 
the opinion of the committee members but will make the final 
decision exclusively at his own discretion? 
  Behind-the-scenes disputes have turned into a situation 
whereby for the last five months or so not a single nomination 
has been submitted to parliament for agreement. Consequently, a 
number of key ambassadorial posts -- first and foremost in the 
United States -- remain unfilled. On the whole, according to 
information from informed sources, around 20 appointments are 
currently "pending." 
  Without going into the substance of the president's 
directive 
in detail, in conversation with IZVESTIYA Deputy Foreign 
Minister Sergey Krylov gave an approximate outline of what the 
appointment process will be: Submitted nominations will be 
discussed in closed parliamentary hearings and only in closed 
hearings so that, the deputy minister said, "ethics are not 
violated and future ambassadors' names are not publicized before 
these ambassadors have received the host country's agreement." 
The Constitution, Krylov stressed, does not place limitations 
on the president in his final choice of a particular ambassador. 
In other words, even if the nomination is rejected by 
parliamentary committees the president is nonetheless fully 
entitled to approve it. 
  Similarly citing diplomatic ethics, Krylov refused to say in 
which specific countries changes will take place in the near 
future, merely observing that, because a Russian ambassador had 
recently died in a Latin American state, there would naturally 
be a new appointment there. 
  Meanwhile, in the State Duma I was informed that there could 
be talk only of open hearings, which will be closed to 
unauthorized persons only when it is necessary to consider 
confidential information. But the parliamentary committees' 
decisions, submitted directly to the president, will in fact be 
secret. 
  "Can the president," I enquired, "insist that the hearings 
be 
closed?" 
  "No," the Duma sources replied, "because the nature of the 
hearings is determined by internal parliamentary regulations 
which have already been approved." 
  After talking to representatives of the Duma, Foreign 
Ministry, and presidential staff you are unlikely to conclude 
that even now, with the signing of the directive, all problems 
have finally been solved and the process of filling vacancies 
and "rotating" ambassadors will get into full swing, although 
this is what Russia's foreign policy interests demand.

  [Text] Several hours ago, a terrorist act was perpetrated 
in Moscow. Our correspondent D. Matyushin has just returned 
from the location. 
  [Matyushin] There was a powerful explosion this afternoon at 
about 0500 hours, near Paveletskiy railway station, alongside 
the famous Logovaz company. Eyewitnesses stated that as Logovaz 
General Director Boris Berezovskiy was driving his car out of 
the gates, a nearby car stuffed with explosives blew up. The 
driver was killed and the director general's bodyguard was badly 
wounded. Boris Berezovskiy himself received burns to his face. 
He was in a state of shock and was taken to the hospital. A 
driver who was passing by at the time of the explosion was also 
hurt. The exploded empty car had Lithuanian license plates and 
a remote control device had been placed in it. According to 
Yuriy Kolpakov, head of the department of city procuracy, it was 
a planned attempt on the life of the director of Logovaz. 
  In Moscow alone in the past six months there have been 10 
such assassination attempts. [Video shows badly damaged car,

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Larisa Kislinskaya] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 8 TASS -- ITAR-TASS has learned about 
some details of an explosion, which occurred at 17.20 Moscow 
time on June 7 near the Paveletskiy railway station in Moscow, 
opposite the restaurant "Vityaz." It was informed by officials 
of the Moscow criminal investigations department today that an 
explosive device of an unknown design was planted in an Opel 
passenger car, parked next to house no. 40 on Novokuznetskaya 
Street, where the office of the Logovaz joint-stock society is 
located. 
  A Mercedes car, carrying Logovaz President Boris 
Berezovskikh, was damaged by the explosion when it drove out of 
the gates of the Logovaz office. The driver died on the spot. 
Berezovskikh, his bodyguard, and three passers-by were wounded 
and had to be hospitalised. 
  Chief of the Moscow Criminal Investigations Department 
Vasiliy Kuptsov believes the terroristic act was directed 
against the Logovaz president. But this is only one of the 
versions. In any case, the owner of the blown-up Opel car with 
licence plates of one of the Baltic republics has still not been 
found. The explosion was very powerful. 
  Experts have still not established the type of the explosive 
device, but one thing is clear -- it was distant-controlled by 
radio. The investigation is being continued. 
  The board of the All-Russia Automobile Alliance and the 
Logovaz joint-stock society has called for immediate vigorous 
measures to find and punish the criminals, who had attempted on 
the life of director-general of the All-Russia Automobile 
Alliance and President of the board of directors of the Logovaz 
joint-stock society Boris Berezovskikh. 
  "The attempt on the life of the initiator of Russia's first 
private investment project, who had earned the trust of millions 
of Russian citizens and who enjoyed the support of the president 
and the government clearly shows that there are forces in our 
society who are vigorously striving to prevent by brutal 
criminal methods the development of civilised entrepreneurship 
in the country, to preclude its economic revival," ITAR-TASS was 
told today at the board of the All-Russia Automobile Alliance 
and Logovaz. 
  The board and share-holders of the All-Russia Automobile 
Alliance and Logovaz believe that the attempt on the life of 
Berezovskikh, member of the leadership of one of the country's 
largest financial-industrial groups, can be qualified as a 
terrostic act and calls for the most serious attention of the 
Russian law enforcement bodies and the public.

  [Text] The number of crimes committed in Russia with the 
use of fire arms has increased from 4,000 to 22,500 (more than 
five times) over the past three years, Head of the Interior 
Ministry's Public Order Department General Vyacheslav 
Ogorodnikov announced during a briefing on Tuesday. Last year 
alone, 3,000 murders were committed and almost 9,000 attacks 
made with the use of fire arms. 
  Ogorodnikov announced that this tendency persisted in 1994. 
Given this, the Interior Ministry has drafted proposals on 
amending and enlarging the laws on the circulation of weapons, 
and proposed measures to toughen punishment for crimes involving 
fire arms. 
  According to the ministry, fire arms get into the criminals' 
hands as a result of improper control during the withdrawal of 
troops from the former Soviet republics and foreign countries. 
Over the past three years, more than 38,000 fire arms have been 
stolen. To quote Ogorodnikov, the openness of the Russian 
borders and instability in North Ossetia, Ingushetia and 
Chechnya also facilitate the inflow of fire arms to the central 
part of Russia.

  [Text] Moscow June 8 ITAR-TASS -- A monthly poll conducted 
by the Association of Political and Economic Experts on order 
from "THE NEW DAILY" has revealed that President Boris Yeltsin, 
Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov, and First Vice-Premier Oleg 
Soskovets are at top of the list of the most influential 
politicians in Russia in May. 
  These leaders scored 54.5, 52.625, and 50.25 points 
respectively. They are closely followed by Premier Viktor 
Chernomyrdin (49.75), Central Bank Governor Viktor Gerashchenko 
(48.125), Yeltsin's body-guard chief Aleksandr Korzhakov 
(47.75), State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin (47.625), National 
Security Council Secretary Oleg Lobov (46.75), Federation 
Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko (44.5), and the president's 
first aide Viktor Ilyushin (44.125). 
  The list published in today's issue of THE NEW DAILY 
comprises 50 names. The newspaper explains that they are the 
names of the leading politicians, including the leaders of 
parties and political movements, executive and legislative 
bodies of power, information and commercial structures in 
command of considerable resources and opportunities for making 
political and state decisions and ensuring their realization. 
  According to experts, regional leaders and officials of the 
military-industrial complex "are now on the offensive". 
  "The modest and quiet Rybkin is today's real alternative to 
the president," they say. "Unless, of course, the left-wingers 
and the patriots agree to support a common candidate, as 
proposed by the Communist Party leader Gennadiy Zyuganov. The 
largest faction in the State Duma is controlled not by the 
Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia (50 deputies), and not by 
Russia's Choice (70), but by the coalition of Communists and 
Agrarians (100 deputies). 
  "Sergey Shakhray's rating has not declined as expected" 
after 
his dismissal from the post of the minister of nationalities and 
regional policy, the newspaper says. "Shakhray is an 
independent figure and his time is not past," the newspaper 
concludes.

  [Text] Moscow June 8 TASS -- The Liberal Democratic Party 
of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, whose programme and tactics were often 
compared to that of Adolf Hitler, fired back on Wednesday 
branding the "Democratic Russia" movement as "fascist" and 
demanding to ban it. 
  Vyacheslav Marychev, a member of Zhirinovskiy's faction in 
the State Duma, proposed to discuss the issue of "banning the 
anti-popular fascist movement `Democratic Russia'" because, 
according to him, it is to blame for the current economic plight 
of the country. 
  The "Democratic Russia" was the major movement which helped 
Boris Yeltsin come to power. 
  The Duma rejected the proposal and Speaker Ivan Rybkin 
stressed that such a question is outside the powers of the lower 
chamber.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report in the "Non-Stop Around the Clock" </F>
column: "Rutskoy Faces a Poor Outlook in Israel"] 
  [Text] Recently a theoretical conference was organized at 
the Central Travelers House entitled "The Ideology of State 
Patriotism and the Struggle Against International Zionism." 
  The conference was initiated by the State Party [Derzhavnaya 
Partiya] led by Terekhov, the Communist Party of Russia, the 
Officers Union, and the Public Committee for Legality and 
People's Power. Apart from politicians, the `struggle' class 
was attended by AL-QUDS publisher Sha'ban, who rented the 
Central Travelers House. Various points of view were aired at 
the meeting but Dr. Sha'ban left everybody else behind. He 
stated that he had personally recruited Russian guys to send to 
Israel on a reconnaissance mission. And now he has 
incontestable evidence that in the south of Israel there are 
secret bases with chemical and bacteriological weapons. 
Allegedly, tests on humans are also conducted there. Another 
speaker explained to the audience that Rutskoy's mother is 
Jewish. In Israel, therefore, he would never be elected even to 
a lousy municipality, let alone the vice presidency. 
  Officers Union leader Stanislav Terekhov explained to 
MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS's correspondent that the aim of the 
conference is to work out a political course and an ideological 
program for the State Party. Terekhov does not intend to 
affiliate with Rutskoy's State [Derzhava] political movement. 
His decision is final and irrevocable.

<F P=106> [Gleb Cherkasov report in the "Project" column: "Rank and </F>
File Democrats in the Regions Are Accustomed to Working 
Together. A United Democratic Center Has Been Formed"] 
  [Text] On 4 June a conference was held in Moscow by 
activists of regional branches of the Party of Russian Unity and 
Accord [PRES], the Russian Social Democratic People's Party, the 
Democratic Party of Russia, Russia's Choice, the Russian 
Democratic Reforms Movement, and other parties and movements 
that are or were part of the democratic political spectrum. 
Furthermore, State Duma deputies and Duma faction and political 
party experts also took part in the conference. 
  According to the conference organizers, the need for holding 
such a meeting was conditioned by the crisis currently unfolding 
in regional democratic organizations, and also the results of 
elections to the Federal Assembly and local representative power 
bodies. Thus, organizing committee representative Vladimir 
Zharikhin (PRES apparatus) noted that conflicts "at the top" 
between Moscow leaders negatively affect the activity of 
provincial primary cells. According to Zharikhin, the reason for 
the centrist associations' relative failure in the elections was 
the fact that their leaders did not manage to come to agreement 
among themselves, while the activists of various regional party 
branches are accustomed to working together, under "one roof." 
Irina Zubkevich, deputy chairperson of the Duma Committee on 
Public Associations and Religious Organizations (Democratic 
Party of Russia faction); and Vladimir Komchatov, the 
president's representative in Moscow, confirmed their 
colleague's point, noting that the "provincials," who have 
worked together for many years, often do not understand the 
reasons for disagreements in Moscow. At the same time, some of 
the "regionals" said quite openly that elections to the Federal 
Assembly destroyed democratic blocs that had existed for several 
years. It was no accident that the new organization's first 
statement says that "the leaders' interests are isolated from 
the interests of individual people, voters, and rank and file 
members of political parties." The conference participants 
virtually unanimously recognized the need for a new association. 
In this context one of the participants observed that "unless 
we hang together, we shall all hang separately." 
  Judging by the organizers' plans, the United Democratic 
Center will not necessarily acquire the form of an election 
association or independent political party. At least, the 
majority of the conference participants did not express the wish 
immediately to leave their parties' ranks. The new organization 
intends to promote "a new political wave that would bring up new 
leaders and create new organizational forms of democratic 
activity." To accomplish these aims, the United Democratic 
Center plans to create an information network and organize 
political workshops inviting foreign experts. The creation of 
financial groups to support regional democratic organization 
activities is not ruled out.

<F P=106> [Gleb Cherkasov report under the "Continuers" rubric: "`New </F>
Names' Casts Off `Russia's Future'"] 
  [Text] The electoral association "Russia's Future -- New 
Names," which failed to clear the 5-percent hurdle in the race 
for deputy seats, now has a successor. The other day the 
Justice Ministry registered an interregional movement calling 
itself "New Names," which has been joined by some participants 
in the electoral bloc of the same name, including federal ticket 
leaders Vladimir Mironov, director of the Institute of Politics; 
and Oleg Sokolov, chairman of the youth organization of the 
Russian Social Democratic People's Party. At the same time, 
Vyacheslav Lashchevskiy, chairman of the Russian Youth Union, 
who used to head the electoral bloc, will not take part in the 
forming of the new organization. "New Names" intends to adhere 
to a social democratic trend and keep in touch with all public 
political associations far removed from extremism. 
  To date, "New Names" has six regional organizations in 
Tataria [Tatarstan], Bashkiria [Bashkortostan], and Tambov, 
among other places. According to "New Names" spokesman Artem 
Smolyannoy, primary organizations were set up in those regions 
where the electoral association managed more than 5 percent of 
the vote. Mr. Smolyannoy pointed out that although many 
activists of "Rutskoy's Party" participate in the work of the 
new organization, most of the participants in the project have 
nothing to do with the Russian Social Democratic People's Party. 
This perhaps explains why "New Names" is quite ready to accede 
to the Treaty on Accord. (Their signature is not there yet 
because they have not been invited to add it).

<F P=106> [Viktor Chemodurov report under the "Furors" rubric: "Where </F>
There Is a Bribe There Will Be a Song"] 
  [Text] Passions are seething in Orlikov Lane, the site of 
Minselkhozprod [Ministry of Agriculture and Food], following the 
arrest of Ivan Romakh, chief of the Main Administration for 
Financial Regulation. Staff at the headquarters of the 
department that provides the country with its grub are playing a 
guessing game: Who will be next to go? 
  A conversation with one Minselkhozprod staffer on the topic 
of current morals at the ministry yielded information which 
sheds light on a number of things. 
  According to this specialist (he asked us not to reveal his 
name), Ivan Romakh merely "allocated" concessionary credits from 
the state budget on self-interested terms; the credits were 
actually released, that is to say approved, by Deputy Minister 
N. Averyanov, who handles finances. It might be a coincidence, 
but a fact remains a fact: Following Romakh's arrest, Deputy 
Minister Averyanov was urgently admitted to hospital. 
  In light of this, the interest displayed by I. Gridasov, 
chief of the Agriculture Main Administration, in the affairs of 
the "Rostok" private firm is becoming increasingly apparent. He 
knows, of course, that in the spring of 1992 R. Kozhenkova, the 
firm's general director, signed a contract with Finland's state 
grain storage organization to supply her firm (which at that 
time was called "Russian-Serbian Seeds") with 20,000 tonnes of 
Finnish selected oat and barley seed worth $5 million. The firm 
received the seeds from the Finns but has still not paid for 
them. 
  Even with this knowledge, Gridasov still respects the 
"Rostok" firm. Last summer, as a member of a delegation from 
this firm, he even visited the former Yugoslavia. And then, 
needless to say, he sowed Yugoslav seeds on Russian fields, 
having secured a state subsidy to do so. 
  "Rostok's" interests are also championed by Ye. Zozimovich, 
chief of the Seed Production Administration. In addition to the 
interests of another firm -- the "Roskukuruza" firm. Meanwhile 
we have reliably been informed that there are documents at 
Petrovka Militia Station which prove that A. Taratushka, 
"Roskukuruza's" deputy director, took cash bribes worth 
thousands of dollars from a specialist in the Kalmyk Ministry of 
Agriculture in order to "encourage" Ministry of Agriculture 
staff. 
  "Roskukuruza," incidentally, has obtained Ministry of 
Agriculture apartments in Dayev Lane, and now the firm's 
directors spend whole days in Gridasov's or Zosimovich's office. 
  The source of our information is convinced that 
Minselkhozprod staff are feeding state loans to private firms, 
only the scale of the corruption is more extensive that appears 
at first glance.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lilia Kuznetsova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 7 TASS -- The international conference 
on problems of refugees and displaced persons on the territory 
of the former USSR, which opened here today, is to discuss the 
reasons and consequences of forced migration, the legal status 
of refugees, and the role of public organisations in the effort 
to alleviate the lot of Russian citizens, who are compelled to 
seek asylum in Russia. 
  In his greetings to the participants of the conference, 
President Boris Yeltsin noted that "a tight knot of 
contradictions" was created by the problem of refugees, and that 
it could be resolved only "on the basis of common sense, good 
will, sense of responsibility to the current and future 
generations, and through corresponding state agreements". 
Expressing the conviction that Russia's efforts in this 
direction would be crowned with success, the president wished 
the forum successful and fruitful work. 
  The speakers, who took the floor during the conference, drew 
attention to the problem of guaranteeing human rights and 
liberties, to the lot of national minorities in Russia, in the 
CIS countries, and in the Baltic states. They focused on the 
need to ensure the property rights of refugees, to settle their 
housing problems, to provide them with jobs, and to help them 
adapt themselves to the new places of residence. 
  The importance of the problem is borne out by the figures 
contained in the report delivered by head of the Russian Federal 
Migration Service Tatyana Regent. She said that there were 
already 500,000 refugees on the territory of Russia, in addition 
to one million displaced persons and half a million economic 
migrants, who are not of Russian origin. Four hundred thousand 
more people will arrive shortly from Transcaucasia, 
approximately the same number from the Baltic states, and about 
three million migrants from central Asia and Kazakhstan, 
provided the situation in Russia developed "smoothly". 
  "They can be accommodated in Russia," Regent believes, "only 
if the state, the public organisations, and the rank-and-file 
Russians pool their efforts to achieve this end." This view is 
shared by representatives from the national peace foundations of 
14 CIS countries and Baltic states, the Russian Federal 
Migration Service, the Department of the U.N. High Commission 
for Refugee Affairs, the International Migration Organisation, 
the Commission for Problems of Citizenship under the Russian 
president, the Russian Foreign Ministry, the Russian Orthodox 
Church, and other organisations taking part in the conference.

  [Text] The number of emigrants is decreasing in Russia. 
Over the past four months it has gone down by 20 percent 
compared to the same period last year, Head of the Moscow 
Interior Department's division for visas and registration of 
foreign citizens, Sergey Alpatov, announced during a briefing on 
Wednesday. 
  He said that Russian emigrants gave preference to the U.S. 
Out of the 2,757 Muscovites who have emigrated over the past 
our months 1,443 chose the U.S., 636 -- Israel and 445 Germany. 
Russian citizens are emigrating to a total of 37 countries. 
  About 500 people have applied for Russian citizenship; 1,457 
have already been granted Russian citizenship. Most of these 
people are residents of the former Soviet republics or 
individuals deprived of citizenship for emigrating to Israel. 
  To quote Alpatov, the Moscow authorities are re-registering 
refugees from foreign countries. About 700 refugees have 
already been re-registered. 
  Alpatov also announced that about 100,000 foreign citizens 
currently live in Moscow; 2,950 permanently.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Tereshchenko report: "Will Fascism and Erotica </F>
Get By?"] 
  [Excerpt] The Russian Federation Committee for the Press 
(Roskompechat) has set about working to expose newspapers of 
fascist orientation published in this country, Roskompechat 
Deputy Chairman Sergey Gryzunov reported to INTERFAX. In his 
words "it is essential to close off the routes by which these 
publications appear and, apart from this, establish who is 
financing and distributing them." 
  S. Gryzunov noted that Roskompechat is enlisting 
representatives of the Moscow Antifascist Committee, 
journalists, as well as foreign diplomats from countries where 
the problem of neofascism has been encountered, in its work to 
expose papers of fascist orientation. 
  "It is essential for us to work out our approach to state 
policy on this kind of publication," he said. He also noted 
that after those papers of fascist orientation existing in 
Russia have been exposed, a ban will be imposed on the 
publication of at least some of them. 
  The mayor of Moscow has banned the sale of erotic literature 
on the capital's streets, having given orders to immediately 
regulate the distribution of such products. Yu. Luzhkov has 
given prefects one month to identify the commercial outlets on 
each's territory which might be used to sell these particular 
goods. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Moscow June 8 TASS -- "We shall not prolong the 
voucher privatisation," head of the Russian state property 
committee Anatoliy Chubays told a press conference here today. 
This means that the ongoing voucher privatisation process will 
end on June 30. Chubays stressed that "it will be rounded off 
with flying colours by June." 
  He told the press conference that he signed an order today 
to 
auction off 63 enterprises, which will be sold for privatisation 
vouchers. They include the "Apatite" production society, the 
Leningrad "Svetlana" association, the "Beryozka" trade house, 
and the "Norilsk Nickel" concern". This will allow the future 
share-holders to make use of their remaining vouchers. As many 
as 126 million vouchers out of the issued 148 millions have 
already been used. Chubays noted that the actual size of 
dividends received for invested privatisation vouchers proved to 
be not as fantastic as initially expected. They fluctuate from 
10 to 200 percent a year.

canceled his instruction of April 1, 1994, which banned 
registration of joint stock societies in Moscow, the press 
service of the Russian State Committee for Property reports 
today. 
  Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin sent a letter to 
Luzhkov on May 27 to demand cancellation of the illegal 
instruction within three days. The mayor told a news conference 
on June 3 he does not plan to change his instructions and "will 
gladly go to the procurator's office" to prove the correctness 
and lawfulness of "special privatization" in the Russian capital. 
  "The cancellation proves that Yuriy Luzhkov has admitted 
gross violations of Russian legislation, presidential decrees 
and government resolutions on privatization. The Federal 
Committee for State Property Management is ready to help Luzhkov 
in restoration of lawful privatization in the city of Moscow," 
says a statement of the press service.

<F P=106> [Nikolay Gorlov report: "Debtors Should Be Bought By </F>
Tender"] 
  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin signed the edict 
"On the Sale of State Debtor Enterprises" 2 June. Sergey 
Belyayev, general director of the Federal Administration for 
Insolvency (Bankruptcy), comments on it. 
  "The new presidential edict marks the start of practical 
selective [selektivnyy] work to restructure industry. Let me 
say right away that it will not be a case of treating everyone 
alike. For instance, there are enterprises owed money by the 
budget. Naturally, an entirely different approach will be taken 
with them. 
  "Clearly, a general point will be that labor agreements with 
the leaders of insolvent enterprises will be torn up and 
management transferred to a newly created collective organ with 
the participation of state representatives. 
  "In principle the sales procedure laid down in the edict is 
aimed at preventing bankruptcies. I am confident that many 
enterprises and their leaders who receive insolvency notices 
will themselves try to get out of the danger zone. 
  "As I have already said, the measures stipulated by our 
legislation will be taken against those for whom this proves too 
much. Incidentally, apart from selling off enterprises, there 
could also be decisions on state support, reorganization, and so 
forth. 
  "Talking specifically about the sale of enterprises, this is 
a question of espousing the generally accepted world practice 
and moving to a fundamentally new type of privatization. Any 
corporate bodies or individuals will be able to take part in the 
tenders -- including foreigners, who are permitted to do so 
under existing regulations. 
  "A whole host of extra conditions -- on the procedure for 
repaying debts, on investment, the retention of jobs, and so 
forth -- may be stipulated when a debtor enterprise is being 
sold off."

<F P=106> [Mikhail Lantsman report in the "Insolvency" column: </F>
"Russian Bankrupts Will Pass Under State Trusteeship. Their 
Property Will Be Available for Purchase for One Ruble"] 
  [Text] By the end of this month the first decisions will 
be made on competitive sell-offs of state enterprises considered 
insolvent. This was announced by Sergey Belyayev, chief of the 
Federal Administration on Insolvency (Bankruptcy) under the 
Russian Federation State Property Management Committee 
[Goskomimushchestvo], at a press conference yesterday devoted to 
the presidential edict "On Selling State Debtor Enterprises." 
All decisions will made by a special commission created by the 
Administration, taking into account the opinion of sectoral 
ministries and regional authorities. 
  According to Goskomimushchestvo, approximately 100,000 
Russian enterprises can today be classed as state controlled. 
Federal Administration on Insolvency (Bankruptcy) experts made 
a preliminary analysis of the payment balances of medium-size 
and large enterprises with a staff of over 1,000. The results 
of the examination have shown that approximately 1,500 
enterprises with a state share in their incorporation capital of 
over 25 percent fall under the criteria of insolvency. The most 
difficult situation has developed in the textile industry, 
machine building, and the transport sector. 
  By 1 July, according to Belyayev, his department will 
prepare 
a list of potential bankrupts. As of now 30 enterprises have 
been officially ruled insolvent, 20 of which are in Moscow. 
Moscow's predominance, however, administration officials 
explained, is in no way related to the confrontation between 
Goskomimushchestvo Chairman Anatoliy Chubays and Moscow Mayor 
Yuriy Luzhkov. It is simply that the proximity of the Moscow 
industrial region to federal power bodies makes Moscow a 
convenient ground for testing bankruptcy procedures. 
  In spite of a large number of organizations that meet 
insolvency criteria under the presidential edict, Mr. Belyayev 
noted that the document's thrust is to prevent the real 
bankruptcy of state enterprises. The state legalizes its 
ownership rights in order to stop the spontaneous 
self-dissolution of enterprises, prevent latent unemployment, 
and in a civilized manner resolve the payments crisis, he said. 
  The entire process -- from deeming an enterprise insolvent 
to 
making a decision to sell it -- envisions a whole number of 
procedures. Experience -- limited so far -- has shown that the 
stigma of insolvency serves as a good incentive for enterprise 
directors to repay their debts as soon as possible. If the old 
management fails to cope, the enterprise will pass under the 
trusteeship of the Federal Administration on Bankruptcy which 
will decide which is economically more effective: to restore 
its balance of payment or take it out of the production sphere. 
The criterion of "economic effectiveness" in decisionmaking 
will, however, be substantially influenced by existing social 
realities. First of all this will bear on so-called 
town/enterprises that contain more than 50 percent of the town 
infrastructure. In any event, administration officials believe, 
the extra-juridical bankruptcy procedure stipulated in the edict 
is more advantageous to enterprises than dealing with creditors 
in arbitration courts would be. 
  The basic criterion in determining the bankrupts' selling 
price will be the sum of their unpaid debts. In this connection 
Belyayev did not rule out a hypothetical option whereby property 
can be acquired for a symbolic price of one ruble. Competition 
for bankrupt enterprises, Belyayev noted with optimism, will 
attract domestic and foreign investors because the edict allows 
them, in addition to debt obligations, to take control of the 
entire property at once. 
  An objective analysis of the reasons for insolvency, it was 
noted at the press conference, will identify the range of 
enterprises really needing state support. Nonetheless, the 
state 1994 budget envisions subsidies only to coal mines. Until 
next year Goskomimushchestvo hopes for wide solicitation of 
extra-budgetary funds. 
  By 1 September, the Federal Administration on Insolvency 
chief promised, a new bankruptcy law concept will be published.

<F P=106> [Sergey Razin report under "Our Commentary" rubric: "Major </F>
Reforms at the Starting Gate"] 
  [Text] Only bankruptcies will be able to do away with the 
nonpayments crisis. This is the radical conclusion arrived at 
by Yeltsin, having signed the edict "On the Sale of State Debtor 
Enterprises." 
  Will this edict work? There are no particular doubts about 
this, insofar as the bankruptcy mechanism, which is in the hands 
of Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee for the Management of 
State Property] and which, in point of fact, represents the last 
chance for Chubays and the entire Gaydar wing to triumph in the 
extremely difficult battle for real reforms in the economy, has 
been thought out precisely enough. 
  In line with the edict, debtor enterprises, having admitted 
bankruptcy, transfer to the Federal Administration for 
Insolvency Affairs under Goskomimushchestvo. In doing so, the 
question of dismissing the enterprise manager as being unsuited 
to the post occupied by him is fundamentally resolved. 
  Such a severe measure will, undoubtedly, discourage 
directors 
from "dragging their feet" on privatization, selling off plant 
property, awarding themselves huge salaries while the enterprise 
heads for complete collapse, and senselessly forcing up prices 
for their own output by including therein unbelievably inflated 
outlays. Taking the big picture, there is no nonpayments 
problem in our economy -- there is the problem of the 
inefficient state sector bequeathed to us from the communist 
past, and which, owing to political machinations, has yet to be 
eradicated once and for all. Now, it seems, the time has come 
to untie the hands of the reformists completely. 
  Such a drastic turnabout in the president's fairly cautious 
and flexible strategy in economic reform is attributable to at 
least three important circumstances: First, Russian industry is 
charging full steam ahead toward the Ukrainian version of total 
collapse. Second, the voucher-based privatization and the 
titanic efforts made by Chubays were not, for all that, in vain 
-- there are now so many joint-stock enterprises that 
market-oriented directors with the skill to stay afloat under 
the new conditions have begun to outnumber antimarket ones, who 
can quite simply be ousted now -- and not just from their jobs, 
but from the political arena too. Third, the "goundwork" of 
capitalist reform -- the stage of the primary accumulation of 
capital -- is nearing an end in Russia. Enormous sums of money 
deposited in commercial banks are ready to pour into our 
industrial sector, but on the basis of private business. The 
presidential edict is opening these financial floodgates, and, 
to all appearances, a new era which should soon enter the stage 
of industrial boom is beginning in the economy.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS analyst Igor Galkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 7 TASS -- Three major Russian banks are 
already working with the national currencies of former Soviet 
republics, including the "Rossiiskiy Kredit", "Menatep", and 
"Alpha". They are handling cashless settlements and 
transactions with the cash money of some republics of the former 
USSR. These banks are risking quite a lot, but their main 
purpose is to get a foothold on this promising market. 
  The Central Bank of Russia is constantly stressing that this 
is, indeed, a very promising business. It has issued an 
instruction, saying that the Russian commercial banks are 
permitted to carry out, without any special agreement, 
transactions with the national currencies which it quotes. 
Today, the Central bank fixes the exchange rates of the 
currencies of all the republics of the former USSR, except the 
Caucasian states and Turkmenistan. 
  The recent attempts to effect settlements among the former 
Union republics in freely convertible currencies and through 
bank correspondence accounts have proved futile. In the 
meantime, the need for the active financial interaction of the 
new sovereign republics is dictated by their cooperation links 
in production, trade, travel, and the need to remit money from 
one republic to another. This is why Russian experts 
persistently recommend the active use of national currencies in 
mutual settlements. What is preventing this? Assistant Head of 
the Foreign Transactions Department of the Russian Central Bank 
Andrey Vernikov told ITAR-TASS that the work of the national 
banks with local currencies was complicated by the high rates of 
inflation in the newly independent states, unpredictable 
currency regulations, restrictions and bans on export and import 
trade. Vernikov and his colleagues believe it is most important 
for surmounting these obstacles to guarantee the "smooth work of 
the currency market". 
  "This means," Vernikov explained, "that all the national 
currencies should be sold on the markets of each of the newly 
independent states. A bilateral union must be concluded to make 
our money sell freely in Kazakhstan and vice-versa. The union 
becomes multilateral if several such agreements are intertwined. 
It may be joined also by the east European states. Russia has 
already concluded agreements with the national banks of Bulgaria 
and Hungary, allowing their enterprises to effect settlements 
with Russian partners and make payments in national currencies. 
Poland, Mongolia and Slovakia are displaying interest in such 
agreements." 
  The concept of a payments union was received with 
understanding by a recent meeting of representatives from the 
central banks of the republics of the former USSR and their 
governments. Then it was approved by the heads of CIS 
governments, which authorised corresponding bodies to draw up an 
agreement on a payments union in accordance with this concept, 
which is to be a voluntary association of states, intended to 
ensure uninterrupted payments on the basis of mutually 
convertible national currencies. 
  "The implementation of the system of mutual convertibility 
of 
national currencies of the former republics of the Soviet Union 
must without doubt proceed stage by stage. The payments union 
may be joined by countries that deem themselves ready to accede 
to it and are prepared to assume concrete commitments," the 
representative of the Russian Central Bank believes.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Federation Defense Minister Army </F>
General Pavel Grachev by military observer Viktor Badurkin; date 
and place not given: "The Army: Duty and Debts"] 
  [Text] [Badurkin] Pavel Sergeyevich, the events of recent 
weeks -- the Black Sea conflict, the "games" with NATO, the 
spring draft, and the parliamentary hearings -- have intensified 
readers' interest in the Russian Army, its problems and 
concerns. Let us talk about how they are to be resolved, and 
what awaits our Army in the future. 
  [Grachev] Your fellow journalists often reproach me with the 
fact that military reforms are proceeding slowly and that very 
little is changing in the Army. Leaving aside their blatant 
malevolence, I agree with many serious and well-supported 
criticisms. I also want the painful process of shaping and 
reforming the Russian Armed Forces to be over and done with as 
quickly as possible. But wishes are one thing, and real 
possibilities are quite another. After all, we have to change 
the Armed Forces' structure and recruitment system, make 
reductions, withdraw our troops from abroad, rehouse them in the 
Motherland, constantly maintain combat effectiveness at the 
proper level, and resolve a host of legislative and social 
questions -- all at the same time. And all this with funding 
that it is more than modest. So that we have plenty of headaches. 
  Just look at the effort involved in the reduction alone -- 
by 
almost one-third. We have "pulled" back to Russia from abroad 
around 140 units and combined formations numbering 280,000 men. 
These are not just figures -- they represent human destinies, 
homelessness, lack of facilities, grievances, and 
disappointments.... 
  [Badurkin] And, as a consequence, a fall in the prestige of 
military service even in the officer corps.... 
  [Grachev] Naturally. Those who remain in the Army today are 
people who are are serving the Fatherland not for money but, so 
to speak, for the idea, in response to a spiritual urge. The 
monetary pay and allowances even of a senior officer who has 
spent 10 years in the garrisons is half that of a Moscow 
trolleybus driver. A fighter pilot earns a sixth of what a 
civil aviation pilot earns. And this despite the fact that in 
recent years both legislators and the government have been 
trying to meet the Army's needs halfway. The material situation 
of our officers, NOC's and enlisted men is in no way comparable 
with the income of servicemen in other countries -- including 
countries which are significantly behind Russia on the economic 
level. Though in Russia, if you recall history, the level of 
material support of "state people" has in all times been high 
enough. 
  The same applies to apartments. Last year we failed to meet 
the quota for commissioning apartment blocks owing to 
underfunding, and I am not confident that the situation will 
improve seriously this year. 
  [Badurkin] But, despite all the difficulties, the Army must 
remain the Army, Russia's defender.... 
  [Grachev] The main thing that we have achieved in the 
two-and-a-half years of the Russian Armed Forces' existence is 
to have created a combat-effective and controllable Army. The 
priority undoubtedly belongs to the strategic nuclear forces as 
the real guarantor of the country's security. Right now we are 
carrying out the provisions of the doctrine with regard to the 
general-purpose force groupings, and we have begun to set up a 
new operational-strategic formation -- the mobile forces. 
  In the transitional period -- through 2000 -- the Armed 
forces will retain their five-branch structure, although each 
branch will undergo significant transformations and reductions. 
The Air Force, for example, has already been reduced by 20 
percent; of the 15 air formations, nine remain. In the reform 
of the Air Defense Forces special attention is being paid to the 
creation of aerospace defense and a system for monitoring the 
airspace. In the Navy submarines, surface ships, and combatant 
crafts that are obsolete and have lost their utility are being 
actively decommissioned. The Navy's entire basing and support 
system is being brought in line with the new conditions. The 
most alarming problem in the Navy is the problem of salvage, 
since a significant number of ships -- almost two-thirds of the 
total complement -- are in the concluding phase of their service 
life. 
  We have managed to somewhat improve the traditional system 
of 
operations training, to make significant modifications to the 
organization of mobilization training, and to reduce the amount 
of manpower and resources diverted to exercises and training. 
Unfortunately, in combat training we have had to stop holding 
divisional and regimental exercises in the interests of economy. 
  Incidentally, the results of inspections show that the 
majority of regiments and ships, despite shortages of manpower 
and a host of other problems, are coping with their tasks. 
Thanks are due to the officers who are fulfilling not only 
their own duties but also soldiers' duties as well. Thanks to 
their self-sacrificing labor we are keeping "afloat." 
  [Badurkin] Nowadays everyone knows about the "joys" of 
military service and the officer's life. Many hoped that, with 
the adoption of the Law "On the Status of Servicemen," the dire 
situation of Russian officers would change. But yet again they 
were disappointed in their expectations. 
  [Grachev] Yes, implementation of the Law "On the Status of 
Servicemen" is proceeding with difficulty; only one-half of it 
is currently operating. The main reason is the absence of 
appropriations. However, in several cases the situation around 
this law is being aggravated artificially. We understand 
clearly that, at the present time, when the crisis in the 
economy and the financial and credit system has not yet been 
overcome, it is difficult for the state to ensure the immediate 
implementation of all the law's articles. Servicemen are 
prepared to wait. But I absolutely cannot agree with those who 
claim that servicemen have too many privileges. Many categories 
of citizens have advantages and privileges; this is aimed at 
attracting intellectual forces and specialists to one sphere of 
human activity or another, or to compensate for the special 
features of the professional activity. In view of the country's 
difficult economic situation we would not object to the 
suspension of certain "expensive" articles of the law, but we 
want this question to be resolved entirely openly, with the 
participation of our competent structures, and not to lead to a 
severe reduction in the already poor material living standards 
of Army and Navy personnel. 
  [Badurkin] Pavel Sergeyevich, throughout our conversation we 
have been touching willy-nilly on a very important problem -- 
money, or more accurately the lack of money to carry out the 
tasks facing the Armed Forces. How are you to succeed in making 
ends meet? 
  [Grachev] As is well known, the reduction of military 
expenditure has been going on since 1969. Our budget has been 
"trimmed" by 100 percent in comparable prices in the intervening 
years. In 1993 only 65-70 percent of the Army's minimum 
requirements were met. The Ministry of Defense has become a 
huge debtor. As of the beginning of the year the debt for 
supplies and services was over 2.2 trillion rubles [R]; today it 
has already grown to R6 trillion. But you cannot put a figure 
on the hidden debt which arises from combat and operations 
training events not been carried out, from exercises, marches, 
and flights postponed to a later date or canceled altogether, 
from the unresolved tasks in the improvement of military camps, 
the preparation of communal facilities for winter, and the 
transportation of basic necessities to the Far North regions and 
the Arctic. Poor funding inflicts irreparable damage on the 
Armed Forces. 
  The sum of R37.1 trillion, calculated by the Ministry of 
Defense as the level of the share of military expenditure in GDP 
last year (5.03 percent) and included without any analysis or 
appraisal in the draft federal budget under the article 
"National Defense," is significantly less than the sum that the 
Army now needs. In view of the fact that we have been on 
"starvation rations" for two years already, the R53 trillion 
approved by the president in the form of an amendment to the Law 
"On the Federal Budget for 1994" and supported by a number of 
State Duma Committees is still insufficient. However, this sum 
will still enable the tasks facing the Armed Forces to be 
performed at the minimum level and prevent the defense complex 
from being destroyed once and for all. 
  [Badurkin] Military expenditure is a difficult burden for 
any state, especially for Russia today. Perhaps the Ministry of 
Defense should devote more attention to saving, and not to 
"extorting" funds? 
  [Grachev] We understand perfectly that the reduction of 
military expenditure is a measure which is essential for our 
country. And we are ourselves looking for reserves. On my 
instructions everyone is tackling these questions: deputy 
ministers, commanders in chief, and directorate chiefs. All the 
plans and individual measures in the organizational development 
and training of the Armed Forces are subjected to economic 
expertise. Anything superfluous, irrational, or nonpriority is 
immediately discarded. In the interests of economy, tours of 
inspection among the troops by generals and officers of the 
central apparatus have been sharply restricted in the last year, 
and the number of assemblies has been reduced. We are taking 
stern measures against officials who allow mismanagement and 
waste. We are not leaving any incident of abuse unanswered. 
The sale of military property is being carried out 
energetically. We are gradually getting used to the market 
economy, and it is forcing us to seek unorthodox ways of 
obtaining the funds that are vital for the performance of urgent 
tasks. However, it should not be forgotten that the Army is not 
a commercial structure but a budget-funded organization, and our 
possibilities are extremely limited. 
  [Badurkin] A last question, Pavel Sergeyevich. You often 
meet your Western colleagues. How do they feel about Russia and 
our Army? 
  [Grachev] I will not speak about politicians; the tone of 
their statements depends on many factors. Military men, 
however, think in real categories and understand that Russia has 
not ceased to be a great nuclear power and must be treated 
seriously. I have formed good relations with the majority of 
Western defense ministers and the NATO command. They agree with 
us that firm security and stability in various regions can be 
ensured only on the basis of equality and by taking into account 
the interests of every state, including Russia.

  [Text] Moscow June 7 TASS -- A Cosmos-2,281 satellite was 
launched from Plesetsk cosmodrome by a Soyuz-U booster rocket by 
Russia's space defence forces at 11.20 moscow time (07.20 GMT) 
on Tuesday. 
  The launch was successful. This was the 415th launch since 
December 27, 1971 when the first booster rocket of this type was 
lofted into space, Major-General Anatoliy Ovchinnikov, director 
of the Plesetsk cosmodrome, told ITAR-TASS. Preparations are 
being finalised at the cosmodrome for the launch of a photon 
technological spacecraft which is to blast off in one week's 
time. 
  The photon is an automatic laboratory fitted out with a set 
of technical facilities to obtain organic and inorganic 
materials and substances with improved characteristics in zero 
gravity. Specialists from the French national space research 
centre take part in the preparations. 
  In view of the fact that the satellite, which was launched 
from Plesetsk on May 25, 1994, failed to reach orbit, its number 
was given to the satellite launched today.

  [Text] Moscow June 7 TASS -- Cosmonauts Viktor Afanasyev, 
Yuriy Usachev and Valeriy Polyakov opened on Tuesday an 
international conference on space biology and aerospace medicine 
by a reportage on research now conducted on board the orbital 
station Mir. Doctor Valeriy Polyakov offered to scientists a 
report containing the results of medical research for which he 
was the object. 
  Corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences 
Anatoliy Grigoryev, academician of the Russian Academy of 
Medical Sciences, director of the Institute of Medico-Biological 
Problems, then took the floor. He noted that 430 reports 
reflect all the aspects of the problems discussed. They sum up 
new results received from experiments on biological satellites 
and in prolonged space flights and after the studying the state 
of the organism in extreme circumstances during flights or 
diving. All these reports are of fundamental nature but also 
have practical importance. This data will be used for medical 
ensurance of flights and underwater work, including the 
selection, training medical checks, prophylactics and treatment 
of diseases and rehabilitation. 
  Questions of international medico-biological cooperation in 
space will also be discussed at the meeting attended by 
representatives of many countries, and also representatives of 
the European Space Agency.

  [Text] Employees of the St. Petersburg Department of 
Russia's Federal Counterintelligence Service (FCIS) to combat 
terrorism have conducted an investigation and detained a group 
of people who intended to sell more than three kilograms of 
uranium dioxide (the share of uranium-235 isotopes is 
90%). 
  The people involved in this case were detained early March 
after the first information was received by the FCIS. Leader of 
the Department's press service Yevgeniy Lukin underlined in his 
interview with Interfax that during this month employees of the 
service managed to reveal all places where this strategic 
material was kept and not to lose even a gram of this material 
which presents radioactive danger. 
  A total of 3.05 kilograms of powder were confiscated, part 
of 
it was kept under conditions presenting danger primarily for the 
life and health of the criminals and their relatives. They kept 
it in a glass pot and a metal retort. 
  Decontamination operations were conducted in one of the 
suburbs of St. Petersburg where the powder was kept. A butcher 
of a food shop and a plumber were among the people who tried to 
sell this strategic raw material. 
  Employees of the St. Petersburg Department established that 
the uranium was stolen from one of the enterprises belonging to 
the Automobile Industry Ministry and situated near Moscow. The 
case which was instituted in accordance with Article 223, part 3 
of the Criminal Code -- robbery of radioactive materials -- was 
transferred to the prosecutor's office to St. Petersburg for 
further investigation. 
  The FCIS does not rule out that the stolen uranium-235 can 
be 
sold abroad. According to some estimates, the price of one gram 
of this substance which is used in atomic industry is 300 
dollars. 
  The press service of the St. Petersburg department reported 
that the president was informed about this case by a special 
report.

  [Text] Moscow June 7 TASS -- Russian Minister for Nuclear 
Power Engineering Viktor Mikhaylov has voiced the creation of a 
close joint stock society Matech to process highly-enriched 
uranium extracted from Russian nuclear weapons into low-enriched 
to be sold to the United States as a fuel. 
  The society is the first joint venture in highly-enriched 
uranium technologies, sources at the Ministry of Nuclear Power 
Engineering's press and public relations department told 
ITAR-TASS today. It has been set up by the Russian Academy of 
Sciences, the Urals electro-chemical plant, the Siberian 
chemical plant and the U.S. Allied Fuel Energy Service Company. 
  In the opinion of the ministry, Matech will help nuclear 
arms 
reduction and creation of a special fund for conversion of the 
defence industries, increased safety of nuclear power plants and 
environmental protection in Russia.

<F P=106> [Report by V. Kornev (Federation of Independent Trade Unions </F>
of Russia Information Center): "Siren Will Call to Strike"] 
  [Text] At a meeting with journalists, Nikolay Zinovyev, 
secretary of the Russian Association for the Defense Sectors of 
Industry Executive Committee, confirmed the defense sector 
workers' readiness to conduct an all-Russia protest action 9 
June. 
  "In accordance with the draft budget," he stated, "the funds 
allocated by the treasury for the purchase of weapons and 
military hardware will be decreased by a factor of five and a 
half. The state order in this sphere is at present funded by 3 
percent, and the state's debt to the defense sectors this year 
was 1 trillion rubles." 
  A number of trade unions in the association have adopted a 
decision not to stop production for 10-15 minutes, as had been 
announced earlier. After all, strikes in the defense industry 
are banned by law. 
  Nevertheless, a protest action will take place. After a 
signal from the plant sirens, defense industry workers in the 
Russian regions held meetings and rallies between 1000 and 1300 
Moscow time.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Kosse: "Russia Recruits Mercenaries </F>
from Donbass"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The shortage of personnel in 
the Russian Federation's remote military districts has forced 
the commanders to seek nontraditional solutions. A telegram was 
dispatched from Maritime Kray to the Khartsyzsk, Donestk Oblast, 
city military commandant's office asking for experienced 
commanders and infantry fighting vehicle and tank drivers to be 
selected for extended service close to the Russian-Chinese 
border. Those who want to serve are promised every possible 
benefit -- from the provision of an apartment to the reckoning 
of one year's service as two. 
  The Russian Army, while not yet becoming professional, is 
becoming a mercenary one. And it is not ruled out that in the 
very near future the parliamentarians of the CIS countries will 
come up against the problem of mercenaries at the legislative 
level. After all, there is not a word on the subject in the 
current constitutions, but men roaming from country to country 
with assault rifles in their hands already exist....

  [Text] The incident involving an American Lockheed C-130 
that violated the Russian air space on Tuesday and was forced to 
land by Russian Air Defence in Adler near Sochi is being studied 
in Washington where all the necessary information was sent. 
This was reported to Interfax on Wednesday by a spokesman for 
the Russian Foreign Ministry Grigoriy Karasin. 
  In his opinion, Americans should be given time to study the 
circumstances. After that it would be logical to hold a meeting 
of high-ranking experts from Russia and the U.S. to prevent such 
incidents in the future, Karasin said. 
  As Interfax reported, the American plane was flying from 
Frankfurt-am-Main to Tbilisi. No requests were made for its 
flight across Russian territory. 
  On Tuesday evening the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister 
Anatoliy Adamishin sent a note to the American ambassador in 
Moscow Thomas Pickering. He hoped that the American side would 
apply disciplinary measures to those responsible. 
  Meanwhile, the main air traffic control center of Georgia 
has 
told Interfax that it is in no way responsible for the incident 
involving the American plane as it is does not belong to Georgia.

  [Text] Moscow, 8 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- Despite increasing 
pressure to impose sanctions against the DPRK which, allegedly, 
is developing its own nuclear weapons, Moscow maintains that 
this problem should be tackled by an international six-plus-two 
conference which has been suggested by Moscow. This was 
reiterated today by Russian Federation Deputy Foreign Minister 
Aleksandr Panov to an ITAR-TASS correspondent. 
  "Our position has remained the same as before: We are for 
the 
conference, which should tackle this problem," the high-ranking 
Russian diplomat said. "It should be considered multilaterally, 
since the dialogue on the bilateral level has failed." 
  The Moscow initiative, which was confirmed by Russian 
Federation President Boris Yeltsin at his recent talks with 
President of the Republic of Korea Kim Yong-sam, envisions the 
convening of an international conference on security and 
nuclear-free status of the Korean peninsula, with the 
participation of South and North Korea, Russia, the United 
States, China, and Japan, as well as the United Nations and the 
IAEA (the International Atomic Energy Agency). "We believe that 
this is the way out of the situation," said Aleksandr Panov.

conference. Andrey Kozyrev also noted that international 
measures should be introduced and lifted by the UN Security 
Council alone.

  [Text] Kim Yong-sam, president of the Republic of Korea, 
arrived in Vladivostok today after concluding bilateral talks in 
Moscow. He was met at the airport by representatives of the 
mass media of Russia and a number of foreign countries. Our 
correspondent, Oleg Padenko, was present at the meeting, and 
here is his report. 
  [Begin recording] The brief visit by Kim Yong-sam, president 
of the Republic of Korea, took place immediately after his talks 
with Boris Yeltsin and the signing of the joint Russo-Korean 
declaration on economic, political, and cultural cooperation 
between Moscow and Seoul. And here I will note that Kim 
Yong-sam is the first president of the Republic of Korea to 
visit Maritime Kray where 60,000 of his countrymen currently 
reside having, in one way or another, settled here after the 
Second World War. Thus, not only is Maritime Kray close to 
South Korea geographically, but it also has special historical 
significance for the Koreans. As was highlighted at this 
meeting, Korean immigration to the Maritime Kray began over 100 
years ago. Some settled here for reasons of poverty and war, 
others with the aim of continuing the struggle for national 
independence. For them, the Maritime Kray was the promised 
land, a firm base for the struggle for independence. 
  It was also noted that the Maritime Kray now is 
progressively 
turning into a center for Russo-Korean cooperation. 
Specifically, work on a joint fishing program is already being 
actively carried out here. Our kray is directly associated with 
the Yakutia, Republic of Sakha, gas project, and a new plan for 
the development of natural resources of the Russian Far East. 
Industrial cooperation is developing, evidenced as we know by 
the creation of the Nakhodka Technical Park, comprised of Korean 
enterprises; the establishment of sea routes connecting 
Vladivostok and the port of Pusan; the commissioning of the 
first direct Vladivostok-Seoul satellite telephone link here in 
Vladivostok; and finally, the opening of regular air services 
this year between Vladivostok and Seoul, the capital of South 
Korea. 
  Today, the South Korean leader visited the Pacific Fleet's 
combat ship Admiral Vinogradov, where he specifically noted that 
such a visit is also a demonstration of partnership and mutual 
cooperation in assuring international security, specifically on 
the high seas. 
  During the brief talks with the high-ranking guest, Yevgeniy 
Nazdratenko, governor of Maritime Kray, discussed the 
possibility of mutually profitable ties and guarantees from 
Seoul in attracting South Korean investment into the kray 
economy, primarily capital investment in the coal producing 
enterprises of the kray. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Platkovskiy report: "Pyongyang Meets Threat With </F>
Threat"] 
  [Text] Consultations are being held in the UN Security 
Council about how best to punish the DPRK for disrupting 
international monitoring of [kontrol nad] its nuclear programs. 
Meanwhile, Pyongyang is threatening to withdraw once and for all 
from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. 
  The majority of Security Council members no longer has any 
doubt that the introduction of sanctions against the DPRK is the 
best means of forcing the North Korean leadership to come to its 
senses. However, Moscow views such a development as extremely 
undesirable. 
  Trading interests aside, there is also the Russian Embassy 
in 
the DPRK, which the Ministry of Foreign Affairs fears would 
become the target of the "uncontrollable wrath of the Korean 
people" -- to use Pyongyang's terminology. Our diplomats and 
their families would feel this wrath directly were Russia to 
support any sanctions, whose introduction Pyongyang assesses as 
"a declaration of war." 
  Meanwile, our military experts are already analyzing the 
possible reaction of the North Korean leadership to the 
introduction of sanctions. A military specialist who worked in 
the DPRK for several years told IZVESTIYA that field commanders 
are in a state of constant stress. Especially those whose 
subunits are stationed in the region of the demilitarized zone. 
No one can predict what may prompt a salvo of fire on Seoul 
from the almost 10,000 North Korean guns stationed in this 
extremely dangerous region.

  [Text] Moscow June 7 TASS -- The Russian side "is striving 
for deepened partnership with NATO without mutual vetoes and 
surprises,". This is the essence of Russian approach to the 
elaboration of a Russia-NATO program and involvement in the 
Partnership for Peace Program, head of the Russian Foreign 
Ministry's Information and Press Department Grigoriy Karasin 
told a briefing here today. 
  The official commented on the upcoming meeting of foreign 
ministers from the North Atlantic Cooperation Council scheduled 
for June 10 in Istanbul. The Russian delegation will be headed 
by Andrey Kozyrev. 
  Moscow has noted recent statements of representatives of 
several NATO member-states about the readiness to account the 
Russian role in provision of European security and stability, 
said Karasin. 
  Speaking of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, Karasin 
said that Russia considers this organization to be important and 
useful, whose role in the system of European cooperation 
institutions will increase. In accordance with the Russian 
concept of European partnership, the council is bound to 
coordinate cooperation in the military-political sphere, namely 
peace-making, under the aegis of CSCE, he added. The council 
could also supervise the implementation of NATO's Partnership 
for Peace Program. 
  According to the Foreign Ministry's representative, the 
Istanbul meeting is expected to result in a political statement 
on topical issues of European and world politics. The ministers 
will also discuss and take into account a report on cooperation 
in peace- making prepared by the council's special group.

  [Text] Moscow June 7 TASS -- Satisfaction was evoked in 
Russia by statements of the Governments of the United States and 
Great Britain in connection with the implementation since May 
30, 1994, of arrangements between the leaders of the three 
states on detargeting of stategic nuclear missiles. Grigoriy 
Karasin, spokesman of the Russian Foreign Ministry, told this a 
briefing on Tuesday. 
  The Russian side again expresses the hope that 
implementation 
by Russia, the United States and Great Britain of the initiative 
for detargeting will precede further measures for 
confidence-building and strategic stability and will set an 
example to other nuclear powers, the spokesman said.

  [Text] Moscow, 7 Jun -- Russia has nothing against 
cooperation between Caspian states and third countries and firms 
from these countries to undertake exploratory work and process 
resources on their territory. Grigoriy Karasin, director of the 
Russian Federation Foreign Ministry's Press and Information 
Department, stated this at a briefing today in connection with 
the appearance in the Russian press of articles on matters 
connected with exploration for and processing of resources in 
the Caspian Sea. 
  However, he noted that with regard to resources in the 
Caspian Sea, there are extremely serious limitations on 
unilateral action because of the vulnerability of its ecosystems 
and the fact that issues concerning the extension of the 
national jurisdiction of the states on the Caspian coast have 
not been sorted out. "The danger that such action might damage 
the rights or interests of other Caspian states is too great. 
Foreign partners who reach agreement on activities of one kind 
or another in the Caspian should take this into account," 
G.Karasin stressed. 
  The Russian diplomat added that efforts were already being 
made now to draw up a mechanism for regional cooperation in the 
Caspian. All issues relating to the use of the Caspian and its 
resources would be resolved under mutually acceptable 
conditions, within its framework. "We hope that such a mechanism 
will be set up in the near future. Until agreement on this is 
reached, unilateral actions by any Caspian state will not lead 
to a change in the laws operating in the Caspian and will not be 
recognized by Russia," G.Karasin said.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: by correspondents </F>
Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others] 
  [Text] Russian foreign minister stressed in an interview 
with Interfax that the NATO Partnership for Peace program was no 
panacea for Russia. "We are not stuck on this program," he added. 
  Kozyrev announced that he was going to discuss the issue at 
the meeting of the NATO Cooperation Council (NACC) in Istanbul 
in which he would arrive from Paris. "We believe that the NACC 
is maybe of even more importance than the Partnership for Peace 
program," he pointed out. We do not agree that the role of the 
NACC be brought down to that of a NATO adjunct. The NACC has 
its own future. It lets NATO reorganize itself and launch 
multilateral cooperation. This is quite an independent direction 
making a part of pan-European partnership, Kozyrev said. 
  He also announced that in the near future Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin would put forward Russia's initiatives on 
development of pan-European partnership where the CSCE would 
play the key role. 
  Kozyrev stressed that Moscow regarded the Russia-NATO 
document recently introduced in Brussels by Russian Defense 
Minister Pavel Grachev as much more important than the 
Partnership for Peace program. Kozyrev stated that the Russian 
formula in the political sphere of cooperation would be made 
known in Istanbul. "Afterwards, we will calmly negotiate with 
NATO, sign the frame document they are proposing and reach an 
agreement on our Russia-NATO program which is certainly more 
comprehensive and serious. We take the Partnership for Peace 
program into account. It is not primarily important for us. 
However, it is not least important for either," Kozyrev 
emphasized.

Gennadiy Temnenkov] 
  [Text] Mainz, Germany, June 7 TASS -- "My official German 
visit may be held this year," Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin told a news conference here today. 
  He said they have such plans, but everything depends on 
certain circumstances. The prime minister visited Germany a 
year ago, and all programs the sides agreed on are being 
fulfilled. 
  A priority of the Russian Government is to create a legal 
basis for foreign investments, said Chernomyrdin. Russia is 
closely cooperating with Germany in this sphere. Germany ranks 
first in Russian-European trade and economic turnover. 
  At the same time, there were some changes and drops in 
bilateral relations. In the opinion of the premier, these 
things are temporary, as Russia and Germany have old traditions 
and many German firms have long been known on the Russian market. 
  Russia has changed, and there is plenty of possibilities to 
develop economic cooperation. The prime minister called on 
German businessmen for more active work on the Russian market. 
He said Russia has eliminated many obstacles on the way of 
economic cooperation. 
  Asked about the Russian attitude to NATO's Partnership for 
Peace initiative, Chernomyrdin referred to a recent visit of 
Russian Defence minister Pavel Grachev to the NATO Headquarters 
in Brussels. 
  "We have accepted the NATO proposal to participate in the 
program, and we are ready to cooperate. We are sure we have 
done right. I am convinced European problems cannot be solved 
without Russia, and we will participate in the program 
regardless any opinions about this. We should establish 
absolutely normal, partner relations between Russia and NATO," 
he said. 
  Asked to comment on Russian reports claiming the prime 
minister is writing memoirs and planning to publish them in 
Germany, Chernomyrdin said he writes no memoirs as he has much 
other work to do. 
  In conclusion the prime minister thanked German Federal 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl for assistance to his Mainz visit.

<F P=106> [Interview with Oleg Lobov, secretary of the Russian </F>
Federation Security Council, by Andrey Apostolov; place and date 
not given: "Oleg Lobov: Bulgaria Is Not Interested in Most 
Modern Russian Weapons Systems"] 
  [Text] [Apostolov] The issue of Russia's joining the 
Partnership for Peace program is current. The reactions of 
certain high-ranking Russian representatives show that there is 
not a uniform attitude toward this issue at the top. 
  [Lobov] The Security Council includes the president and the 
ministers of defense, foreign affairs, and internal affairs, all 
of whom participate in adopting important decisions, including 
the decision on the Partnership for Peace. One should not be 
hasty in anything related to this program. Russia is too big to 
be pressurized. Its power is equal to that of NATO. It is no 
accident that when one says that the United States could destroy 
the world 16 times over, one immediately adds that Russia could 
do it 24 times. However, this is not the most important issue. 
We must understand precisely what we would get out of the 
Partnership for Peace. If Russia has to scrap its arms -- this 
naturally is no partnership. One cannot rationalize in a 
simplistic manner: We offered our hand (to Russia), you 
rejected it, therefore you are the bad guys. All issues must be 
clarified -- this includes the arms systems issue, the rights 
that Russia will have, and so on. The document must be very 
precise and clear. When the documents will be signed is not the 
most important issue. 
  As far as the different attitudes are concerned -- this is a 
natural phenomenon. The minister of defense has his own 
opinion, and the same applies to the president and the foreign 
minister. It is precisely those different views and opinions 
that are being discussed at the Security Council, with a view to 
working out the most precise position and a uniform point of 
view. The Security Council still has not expressed its position 
on the Partnership for Peace program, and is preparing it now. 
  [Apostolov] Mr. Lobov, what attracted your interest in 
Bulgaria -- our weapons technologies or the possibilities of our 
military-industrial complex? Will you purchase, sell, or 
discuss joint production? 
  [Lobov] We were briefed on the possibilities of the military 
industry, and naturally, with its problems. We have no 
intention of purchasing anything. 
  [Apostolov] Would Russia sell Bulgaria its most modern 
weapons, for example, the SU-34? 
  [Lobov] The Bulgarian side did not express any interest in 
this aircraft. 
  [Apostolov] What about other systems that are more modern 
than the MIG-29? 
  [Lobov] No, the Bulgarians did not request such weapon 
systems. 
  [Apostolov] Mr. Lobov, the ratio between the Russian and 
Turkish naval forces in the Black Sea has changed in the last 
few years from 2:1 to 1:1. 
  [Lobov] Yes, this is so, and we must analyze this issue. We 
must think what could happen in the future against the 
background of a Black Sea Fleet that is divided between Russia 
and Ukraine. If the navies of Bulgaria and Russia must be 
strengthened -- then it must be done, and we are prepared to 
help Bulgaria as partners. After all, if we sign the Partnership 
for Peace we become partners, is this not so? Our navies must 
be strengthened. There is a war being waged near our borders.

  [Text] Moscow, 7 Jun -- The coming signing of a package of 
agreements with the Organization of Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD) will be a "major step on the road to 
implementing a strategy of creating political conditions for an 
equitable partnership between Russia and the leading Western 
powers". This was stated today by Russian Federation Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev before his flight to Paris. The head of 
the foreign policy department flew out to the French capital to 
take part in a special meeting with ministers of the 
member-states of the OECD which unites the most developed 
countries in the world. 
  The ceremony of the signing of a declaration on cooperation 
between the Russian Federation and the OECD and also an 
agreement on the OECD's privileges and immunities in the Russian 
Federation will take place in Paris tomorrow, 8 June. 
  Dwelling in this connection on Russia's relations with 
Europe, the minister announced that at the end of the month a 
big agreement might be signed with the European Union at summit 
level. "Thus," he added, "this summer we will already start to 
reap the economic harvest of our political partnership." 
  At the request of journalists, A. Kozyrev expressed his 
opinion on the "nuclear problem" on the Korean peninsula and the 
calls by some countries for economic sanctions to be introduced 
against the DPRK. "In the final count," he said, "it may come to 
a stage-by- stage introduction of sanctions. But before that 
all the other possibilities should be exhausted, including the 
possibility of holding an international conference." 
  Speaking of Russia's possible participation in the 
"Partnership for Peace" program, the Russian Federation foreign 
minister stressed that this program not regarded by the Russian 
side as a panacea. In Istanbul at the end of the week he is to 
take part in a session of the North Atlantic Cooperation 
Council. "This course of action is in keeping with our strategy 
for European partnership," A. Kozyrev said. He said that in the 
near future the Russian president will make initiatives on this, 
initiatives in which the central role in the coordinating the 
process of integration in Europe is allotted to the CSCE.

  [Text] Paris June 8 TASS -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev today signed a package of agreements with the 
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). 
It includes a declaration on cooperation between the Russian 
Federation and the OECD and an agreement between the Russian 
Government and the OECD on the organisation's privileges and 
immunities in the Russian Federation. 
  The documents were also signed by OECD Secretary-General 
Jean-Claude Paye and chairman of the OECD council session, 
Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister of Ireland Dick Spring. 
  The declaration on cooperation envisages, among other 
things, 
that Russia will now enjoy the status of observer in various 
OECD bodies, that it will get access to information possessed by 
the organisation. The OECD will draw up surveys of the economic 
situation in Russia, will make recommendations for the 
implementation of economic reforms, and will assess their 
effectiveness. The second document signed today lays down the 
terms for the work of OECD experts in Russia.

  [Text] Paris, 8 Jun -- Closer ties with the Organization 
for Economic Cooperation and Development [OECD], an organization 
embracing 25 of the world's most developed countries, will make 
a real contribution to Russia's integration with the world 
economy. This was stated today by Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev in his address at the signing of a declaration on 
cooperation between the Russian Federation and the OECD and an 
agreement between the Russian Government and the OECD on the 
granting of privileges and immunities for the organization 
within the Russian Federation. The ceremony was held today at 
the Paris headquarters of this international organization. 
  These documents "pave the way for the expansion of effective 
cooperation between Russia and the OECD in the long term and the 
mutually complementary interests of both countries," the 
minister said. "Thanks to its material and natural resources, 
Russia's involvement with the OECD will help to further enrich 
trade, economic, scientific, technical, and intellectual 
exchanges in the extensive Euro-Atlantic and Pacific region," 
the minister noted. He feels that these documents also provide 
"further important evidence of the world community's support for 
economic reforms in Russia."

  [Text] Moscow, 7 Jun -- The text of the agreement on 
partnership and cooperation between the Russian Federation and 
the European Union is finally agreed and the necessary 
procedures for it to be signed have begun. That is what 
Grigoriy Karasin, head of the Russian Foreign Ministry 
Information and Press Department, told today's briefing for 
Russian and foreign correspondents. He spoke about the results 
of the consultations held in Moscow yesterday. Heads of Foreign 
Ministry political departments from Greece, Belgium, and Germany 
took part in the talks. 
  Karasin said that no effort would be spared to ensure that 
the agreements are signed during the meeting of the European 
Council's heads of states and governments of the European Union, 
which will take place on the Greek island of Kerkira on 24-25 
June 1994. 
  The talks participants, the official spokesman of the 
Russian 
foreign policy department said, also discussed the problem of 
nuclear non-proliferation on the Korean Peninsula. 
Representatives of the European Union, he said, expressed 
concern at tension increasing there because of North Korea's 
unwillingness to achieve a comprehensive settlement. In its 
turn, the Russian side drew attention to the importance of 
working on the idea of convening an international conference 
with the participation of the Russian Federation, the United 
States, China, Japan, North Korea, the Republic of Korea, and 
also representatives of the United Nations, and the IAEA, so 
that it could discuss the problem of security in and a 
non-nuclear status for the Korean Peninsula. 
  During discussion of the situation in the former Yugoslavia, 
Grigoriy Karasin continued, it was noted that there was a 
coincidence of views on and approaches to the situation in 
Bosnia- Herzegovina. It was agreed that that there is a need 
for the Russian Federation, the European Union, and the United 
States to step up efforts with a view to moving closer to a 
political solution. 
  Other topical international problems were also thoroughly 
discussed. Among them were the situation in the Near East and 
the implementation of the Israeli-Palestinian agreement, the 
situation in the Republic of South Africa following the first 
general elections, relations between Russia and the Baltic 
region and Ukraine, and peace-keeping operations in Georgia and 
Nagorno- Karabakh. The representatives of Greece, Belgium, and 
Germany said that the European Union intends to assist in 
developing and strengthening the CIS.

  [Text] The agreement on partnership and cooperation between 
Russia and the European Union is "virtually ready to be signed," 
an aide to Russia's Deputy Premier Aleksandr Shokhin told 
INTERFAX on Tuesday. 
  Shokhin is in charge of preparations for signing the 
agreement. 
  As the aide said, the problems, that could hinder the 
signing 
of the agreement during the EU summit to be held on the Greek 
Island of Corfu on June 24-26, have virtually been resolved. 
  Only the insignificant differences with Greece concerning 
privileges for merchant ships remain to be settled. Greece 
wants such privileges to be spread to its ships going under the 
flags of other countries, such as Panama and Liberia. As for 
Russia, it insists that the privileges must be applied only to 
the ships going under their own nation's flag. 
  According to the source, these differences can be viewed as 
"technical issues". He said he is firmly confident that the 
agreement between Russia and the EU will be signed during the 
upcoming EU summit. 
  Earlier, during a visit to Moscow by France's Foreign 
Minister, Alan Juppe, and his talks with Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, Paris withdrew its reservations concerning 
Russia's trade in nuclear materials. It's common knowledge 
that, like Russia, France is a major supplier of fuel for 
nuclear-power plants in Europe.

  [Text] Moscow, 7 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- Russia is in favor of 
rigidly observing the appropriate resolutions of the UN Security 
Council which have established the regime of trade and economic 
sanctions against Iraq. However, the same resolutions allow 
supplies of goods and produce to Iraq in the form of 
humanitarian aid, provided permission exists from the Security 
Council committee for sanctions, said Grigoriy Karasin, director 
of the information and press department of the Russian 
Federation Foreign Ministry, speaking at a briefing today. 
  In this connection he said that the Russian side is 
seriously 
concerned over a number of Russia's humanitarian requests which 
are now going through the UN Security Council committee for 
sanctions. In particular, for several years now the Committee 
has been blocking Russia's request to supply Iraq with equipment 
in order to continue the construction of Iraq's "Yusufiyah" 
thermal electric power station . 
  "We have always believed that the purpose of our project is 
solely humanitarian. On no account does it contradict the well 
known resolutions of the UN Security Council, particularly 
considering that the special missions of the UN which at one 
time visited Iraq attributed the restoration and the 
construction of the power station in that country to 
humanitarian needs," he said.

  [Excerpts] Kuala Lumpur, 7 Jun -- Russia has entered the 
Southeast Asian arms market with the signing here today of a 
contract to supply Malaysia with 18 MiG-29 fighters. [passage 
omitted] 
  It is very important for Malaysia that, by starting 
wide-scale business cooperation with us, Russia is willing to 
hand over advanced technology to the Malaysians, [Deputy 
Malaysian Prime Minister] Anwar bin Ibragim stressed in an 
interview for an ITAR- TASS correspondent. For this reason, he 
said, Kuala Lumpur regards this present deal as a first major 
step in bilateral ties in the development of the industrial 
infrastructure, power engineering, and other spheres. With full 
justification one can call today's event historic, both for 
Malaysia and for Russia, Malaysian Defense Minister Najib Abdul 
Razak told an ITAR-TASS correspondent. "We are the first 
country in the region to begin defense cooperation with Russia, 
cooperation which is destined to open up broad new opportunities 
for business relations between us," the defense minister said. 
  In a speech at the signing ceremony, Oleg Soskovets [first 
deputy prime minister of Russia] pointed out that the contract 
is evidence of the start of a new stage in the development of 
bilateral relations. "The main thing now, from Russia's point 
of view, is to transform the extensive existing potential into a 
stable range of practical ties between the two countries," he 
stressed.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, 7 Jun -- "Since Malaysia has become 
the first country in Southeast Asia to acquire Russian weapons, 
we discussed the possibility of establishing in this country a 
center for their further promotion in the region." This was 
stated to an ITAR-TASS correspondent by First Vice Premier Oleg 
Soskovets after his meeting today with Malaysian Prime Minister 
Mahathir Mohamad. The Russian Government's representative is in 
Kuala Lumpur on an official visit, and was today present at the 
ceremony of signing the contract for the delivery to Malaysia of 
18 Russian MiG-29 fighters. 
  Malaysia needs new technologies, new scientific 
developments, 
and is displaying a practical interest in the sphere of 
telecommunications and space technology. "They are not 
wondering like some figures have started doing in Russia about 
whether to be in space or not, but they intend to get on with 
it," O. Soskovets said. Thus, during the conversation with the 
head of the Malaysian Cabinet, accord was reached "on 
large-scale and long-term scientific-technical cooperation and 
the transfer of individual Russian technologies to Malaysia." 
It was an "extraordinarily intensive conversation between two 
sides with an interest in cooperation," O. Soskovets stressed. 
  The new Malaysian-Russian relations are "called upon to 
serve 
the two countries for a minimum of 20 years," Malaysian Defense 
Minister Mohamad Najib Abdul Razak stated during today's 
meeting. The sides discussed the prospects for cooperation in 
military technology as a result of signing the contract on the 
MiGs. The war minister called the agreement "the biggest deal 
with Russia," and expressed "interest" in the development and 
expansion of such cooperation.

  [Text] The contract for export of 18 Russian MiG-29 
fighters to Malaysia is extremely advantageous for Russia, the 
Russian president's representative in the Rosvooruzheniye state 
concern, Marshal Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov told INTERFAX. 
  "Arms exports are always beneficial, particularly given the 
current state of Russia's arms complex and shortages of hard 
currency," he said. He also noted that the Russian-Malaysian 
contract was the first step towards the introduction of Russian 
weapons and other goods in this region. 
  He denied reports that the MiG fighters had been sold at 
dumping prices. "Simply, part of the MiG fighters' cost will be 
paid by supplies of Malaysian goods, including palm oil," he 
said. 
  He said that before the Rosvooruzheniye concern established 
its absolute control on the arms market, other agencies had 
wanted to sign this contract. So all these accusations came 
from the people who failed to get the deal, he said. 
  The latest contract could be followed by other ones with 
Southeast Asian and other countries, said Shaposhnikov. 
  According to unofficial sources, the contract is estimated 
at 
600 million dollars. Only 20 to 25 percent of the contract will 
be paid in palm oil supplies.

  [Text] As KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has already reported, there was 
a meeting in Moscow on 30-31 May between deputies of the Russian 
Federation State Duma and U.S. senators involved in defense 
questions. On the U.S. side the working groups were headed by 
Senators S. Nunn and J. Exon, on the Russian side by S. 
Yushenkov and A. Piskunov. 
  The U.S. legislators voiced extreme concern at the state of 
civilian control in the defense sphere in Russia. Special 
attention was paid to the need to monitor the observance of the 
regime governing the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and 
nuclear materials and of chemical and bacteriological weapons 
and their components. The Russian deputies accepted the need 
for civilian control within the framework of the approval of the 
federal budget and verification of its implementation as well as 
the ratification of international treaties, backed up by the 
functions of the parliamentary monitoring of their 
implementation. 
  During the meeting there was a broad exchange of opinions on 
the state of affairs in the sphere of strategic offensive 
weapons. The question of extending the Nuclear Weapon 
Nonproliferation Treaty in 1995 was regarded as a priority. The 
two sides agreed that in mutual relations with Ukraine special 
account is to be taken of the delay in the deadline for the 
latter's fulfillment of the obligations under the Lisbon 
protocol on affiliation to the Nuclear Weapon Nonproliferation 
Treaty, which is holding up the entry into force of the START-1 
treaty and the preparation of START-2 for ratification. 
  Despite the persistent attempts to find coordinated 
decisions, it has not yet proved possible to find common 
approaches on the possible levels of the further reduction of 
strategic offensive arms, even though the sides do not deny the 
need for that, or on the creation of the conditions for the 
testing im military theaters of ABM systems relating to the 1972 
ABM Treaty. 
  Considerable attention was paid at the meeting to the use of 
the U.S. resources allocated by the Nunn-Lugar initiative to the 
destruction and recycling of nuclear and other types of arms 
belonging to the Russian Federation. Attention was drawn to the 
fact that these resources are not being used effectively enough. 
Of the $432 million allocated in 1992-1993, the Russian side has 
used less than $100 million. In view of the slow rate at which 
the executive power structures are concluding the relevant 
agreements it was deemed expedient to hold joint hearings on 
this question in fall 1994. 
  It was noted that joint military exercises are an important 
measure for strengthening confidence between the two countries. 
Bearing in mind the complex domestic political situation in the 
Russian Federation, the U.S. side agreed to propose to its 
government that the initial stage of the joint exercises by 
peacemaking forces be switched to U.S. territory.

<F P=106> [Manki Ponomarev report: "Bill Clinton: Russia Is a Great </F>
Power"] 
  [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton, in Europe to celebrate 
the 50th anniversary of the landing of allied troops in 
Normandy, is being subjected to a concentrated assault by 
representatives of the mass media. They are taking the 
opportunity to interview the head of the White House, to 
ascertain his views on particular topical issues, and to make 
them known to the public. 
  In one such interview which Clinton granted to French 
television, he specially dwelt on relations with Russia and 
declared that he was "very satisfied" with their development. 
In this connection the President emphasized that Russia "really 
is a great power." At the upcoming G-7 meeting in Italy, he 
pointed out, Russia will take part at a "higher level than ever" 
and will participate fully in the discussion of political 
questions. 
  Touching on the problem of the Russian Federation Armed 
Forces' participation in settling conflicts in the former Soviet 
republics, Bill Clinton pointed out that "Russia can play a 
leading role in resolving certain problems in that region." But 
on condition, he remarked, that "the UN and other multilateral 
forces participate" in this process. "Thus it is not a question 
of restoring the empire. Great power -- yes; empire -- no," the 
head of the White House concluded.

<F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Rubtsov: "`Klaus File' Could Bring Closer </F>
Solution to Riddle of the Fate of Many Soviet Citizens Missing 
Abroad"] 
  [Text] A routine session -- the 10th -- of the 
Russian-U.S. commission for seeking U.S. citizens who have gone 
missing on the territory of the former USSR has been held in 
Moscow. According to its cochairman on the Russian side, 
Colonel General Dmitriy Volkogonov, doctor of philosophical 
sciences and historical sciences, the importance of the 
commission's work is increasingly obviously going beyond the 
framework of purely search tasks, becoming an important factor 
in the improvement of the climate in our two countries' 
relations. 
  But the practical results are also substantial. Thus, 
Americans have been handed reports extracted from Russian 
archives about 1,500 U.S. aircraft shot down by Soviet pilots 
and air defense gunners. Many testimonies from witnesses have 
been heard, in particular from former Central Aerohydrodynamics 
Institute staffer P. Kovalskiy, who once took part in the 
investigation of a U.S. F-86 aircraft sent to the USSR, and now 
firmly states that the crew was not on our territory at all. 
  The U.S. side, as Congressman Peterson stated at the press 
conference which took place, is satisfied with the level of 
cooperation. It has received access to previously secret 
documents which are advancing the search considerably. For 
their part the Americans have provided information about several 
Soviet citizens whose traces were lost in Afghanistan and other 
regions. 
  It should be noted that the emphasis in the work of the 
joint 
commission is shifting increasingly to establishing the fate of 
our compatriots. That cannot fail to cause satisfaction, as can 
the action of the U.S. side in this direction -- we have been 
presented with the so-called "Klaus file" which contains 
extensive confidential information from the U.S. special 
services on conflict situations involving Soviet citizens. 
  In general, the longer the commission works the clearer it 
is 
becoming how much the peoples need such search activity. The 
embassies of Britain, Italy, Australia, and other states have 
asked us for help, D.A. Volkogonov noted at the press 
conference. They are also concerned for the fate of their 
missing compatriots, and the experience of the Russian-U.S. 
commission will be useful to them. 
  Or here is one more example of the public response. During 
the press conference representatives of the Kuwaiti mass media 
asked whether the Russian-U.S. commission could not help the 
return home from Iraq of the Kuwaiti citizens still languishing 
there. The commission has no legal powers, was the reply, but 
if instances of the enforced detention of Kuwaiti citizens are 
indeed taking place, the commission is prepared to appeal to the 
world public to promote the humane solution of the question.

<F P=106> [Commentary by IZVESTIYA correspondent Aleksandr Shalnev </F>
from the "Itogi" program] 
  [Text] In Russia today the aid that is given by the United 
States to Russia for our economic reforms--and especially 
technical aid and technical assistance--comes from the United 
States via the so-called Agency for International Development 
[AID]. As was especially stressed recently at hearings of the 
U.S. Congress, only about 200 million dollars have been used of 
the 3.2 billion dollars that were allocated to us since 1985 
specifically for economic and technical aid. If we focus on 
Russia, that figure is 140 to 150 million dollars. 
  The scheme by which this money comes to us in Russia and to 
other countries of the former Soviet Union is fairly simple: the 
AID. The agency will earmark credits; to be more exact, it will 
give grants to appropriate U.S. firms. The latter will send 
their specialists and consultants here, who work with our 
organizations, departments, individual enterprises, lawyers, and 
other people. 
  In particular, a considerable bulk of such grants and 
credits 
has been sent to us as aid to develop our voucher privatization. 
The interesting thing is that, since most of this money is paid 
to U.S. firms, consultants, specialists, and technicians, it 
means that the money, in fact, remains in the United States. 
Say a consulting firm or some specialists arrive in Moscow or 
in another town of Russia. Incidentally, they have enormous 
perks and privileges since they have astronomic daily allowances 
by our standards. They will stay in a luxury hotel, paying 200 
or 300 dollars a night. They arrive on a first class or 
business class flight. In other words, the main bulk of the 
money--or a considerable proportion of the money allocated to 
us--stays in their pockets and is spent in these nonproduction 
areas. 
  The U.S. State Department recently evaluated the first 
privatization period in our country. It noted our successes and 
failures. It also noted where we have reserves [rezervy]. I 
would like to draw your attention to one particular shortcoming 
that was stressed by the State Department. From its point of 
view, too many shares of privatized enterprises remain in the 
hands of the workers and managers of these enterprises. Why is 
this bad? Because the workers and managers of these enterprises 
have no capacity any longer to improve production. They will 
primarily take care of themselves and will not resort to 
measures such as mass layoffs. Naturally, they will spare no 
effort to preserve their jobs and to ensure bearable living 
standards for themselves. 
  The second stage of privatization is going on now. As far as 
I understand it, the agency has already earmarked some credits 
and grants to U.S. consulting firms, including Price Waterhouse. 
These companies are already busy trying to accomplish what has 
not been accomplished during the first stage. What is now left 
for us to do is to wait until the State Department takes stock 
of this stage and tell us what we did well and what we did 
badly. I think, however, that we will be able to see this for 
ourselves quite soon.

  [Text] Moscow, 7 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- Russia today, perhaps 
as never before, needs interaction between its economy and the 
economies of neighboring states. It has sufficient resources at 
its disposal to move swiftly out of economic crisis, and this is 
the aim of its parliamentarians' daily work. State Duma 
Chairman Ivan Rybkin said this during a meeting with Ne'matollah 
Izadi, ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran in the Russian Federation. 
  New legislation is being drawn up in the Duma which will 
guarantee foreign investment in the Russian economy. In Ivan 
Rybkin's opinion, this will permit the scope of traditional 
Russo- Iranian cooperation to be extended. 
  The Iranian ambassador agreed with the State Duma chairman 
about the need to extend bilateral contact in various spheres. 
He noted that the Iranian leadership attaches great 
significance to interaction between the two parliaments in 
inter-state relations. 
  The State Duma press office reports that also today, the 
State Duma chairman met Rogelio Montenegro, ambassador 
extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the Republic of Cuba in 
Russia. 
  The two men held detailed discussions about the problem of 
the U.S. trade embargo on Cuba. Among other things, Ivan Rybkin 
said that he considers as unnatural any sanctions implemented by 
force or embargos in inter-state relations. "Such measures can 
only be justified if there are extraordinary reasons for them," 
he stressed.

<F P=106> [Report by Ferdinand Hennerbichler: "Security Center </F>
Vienna"] 
  [Text] In 1955 our neutrality brought us freedom -- also 
freedom from Soviet communism. Our country became a symbol of 
detente between East and West, a bulwark of peace against war. 
Since the demise of the Soviet Union, democratic Russia has 
shown great interest in preserving neutral Austria's traditional 
peace role. 
  "Stay as you are -- a neutral country in the heart of 
Europe, 
which, with its active policy of neutrality, has made an 
important contribution to peace in Europe for decades and will 
continue to do so. You are an asset for more security in 
Europe!" This conviction is advocated by one of Russia's great 
intellectual pioneers, Professor Vitaliy Churkin, director of 
the Europe Institute in Moscow. 
  In an exclusive interview for NEUE KRONEN-ZEITUNG Prof. 
Churkin appeals to us Austrians not to let ourselves "be 
persuaded by anyone" to give up our neutrality because it is 
outdated and does not have any value in peace times anymore. 
The opposite is true. In particular in the middle of Europe's 
gigantic upheaval our neutral Austria continues to play "a 
central role in Europe's newly developing security system." 
  In the interview with NEUE KRONEN-ZEITUNG, Russia's great 
European strategist cites three reasons why Austria should "keep 
its active neutrality policy": 
<H5>  Military Asset </H5>
  Neutral countries are states with low armament. Thus, they 
are "demilitarized zones" without super armament. They do not 
emanate any military danger. Neutral states with few weapons 
therefore do not pose any danger of war and mean more security 
for all Europeans in East and West. 
<H5>  Strategic Asset </H5>
  Neutral countries like Austria are also buffer zones. They 
are located like buffers between areas of tension, conflicts, 
and wars -- for instance on the fringe of the war hell in the 
Balkans. If the neutrals were taken out of the new Europe, 
enormous contradictions, which still exist on our continent, 
would threaten to clash directly -- without buffers, without 
safeguards, without brakes. The results would be the escalating 
danger of direct confrontations in Europe. 
<H5>  Diplomatic Asset </H5>
  "Europe still needs venues for meetings, for dialogues, and 
for mediation, such as neutral Austria," Prof. Churkin insists. 
If such diplomatic oases of neutrality did not exist, one would 
practically have to invent them to banish war in Europe once and 
for all. 
  Prof. Churkin also sees a central role for neutral Austria 
in 
the newly developing security system in Europe. Russia's 
intellectual pioneer for Europe stresses that the new peace 
system must be supported diplomatically above all by the CSCE. 
Even though it is lagging behind in development, it should play 
the main role. NATO should become the backbone, but is "still 
too highly armed" and must transform itself "more quickly than 
in the past" from a military alliance to the supporter of a new 
security system. 
  "Austria should become a center of the new global security 
system in Europe," Vitaliy Churkin told NEUE KRONEN-ZEITUNG in 
an exclusive interview. He does not yet want to commit himself 
to details. However, he advocates that Vienna become the seat of 
important institutions, such as a European Security Council or a 
military committee. Vienna is already the CSCE center for the 
prevention of conflicts, disarmament, security, and for more 
trust between East and West.

  [Text] A top-ranking official of the Russian Defense 
Ministry has said that reports on the start of the deployment of 
peacekeeping forces in the area of the Georgian-Abkhazian 
conflict on June 7 are not true. 
  The Russian general who spoke on condition of anonymity 
pointed out in an interview with Interfax Tuesday that President 
Yeltsin had given the Defense Ministry no instructions to start 
deploying peacekeepers along the border river Inguri to separate 
the warring sides. 
  The Interfax interviewee emphasized that the ministry was 
not 
entitled to independently make such decisions. At the same 
time, he did not preclude that the peacekeeping operation could 
start in the conflict area within the next few days. 
  With a majority of one vote, the Federation Council declined 
Yeltsin's request to send a 1,500-strong Russian contingent to 
the conflict area last week. The deputies decided that the 
Russian troops' legal status had not been worked through as 
thoroughly as it should have been done. 
  Moscow did not preclude that the Federation Council would 
return to considering the Russian peacekeepers' deployment along 
the Inguri at its regular session on June 21.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovsky; edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin has as yet sent to 
the Russian Defense Ministry no orders to begin the operation on 
separation of the Georgian and Abkhazian troops, a Russian high- 
ranking military official told Interfax. 
  The general asked not to disclose his name. He did not rule 
out that the peacekeeping operation in the conflict zone might 
begin in the next few days. However, he underlined that the 
Defense Ministry could not decide on this independently. 
  IF Note: Last week the Russian Federation Council rejected 
the request to send a 1,500-people Russian military contingent 
to the zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict, put forward by 
Yeltsin. One voice was lacking to send Russian peacekeepers to 
the conflict zone. Deputies considered the present legislative 
basis defining the status of Russian troops abroad to be 
insufficient. Moscow does not rule out that the Federation 
Council will go back to discussion of this issue at its next 
session on June 21. The leaders of the CIS states participating 
in the treaty on joint security have backed the decision to 
bring the peacekeeping forces to the zone of the 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict. Georgian leader Eduard 
Shevardnadze and Abkhazian leader Vladislav Ardzinba also 
supported this decision. 
  Officials close to Yeltsin have no doubt that for the second 
time the Federation Council will back the proposal made by 
Yeltsin. Some experts from the president's administration 
suggested that the president better not force the developments. 
Experts repeated that in accordance with the Russian 
constitution, only the Federation Council can decide on 
performance of Russian servicemen abroad. 
  Today well informed sources in the Georgian leadership told 
Interfax that the Russian peacekeeping forces could start 
implementation of the operation in the zone of the Georgian- 
Abkhazian conflict in the next few days. The same sources 
suggested that the peacekeeping operation could begin during the 
visit of Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev to the Caucasian 
republics on June 8-11. 
  IF Note: During his visit to the Caucasian republics Grachev 
intends to meet Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan, 
Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliyev and Georgian leader Eduard 
Shevardnadze. Grachev wanted to discuss with the leaders 
establishment of Russian military bases in these republics and 
implementation of the peacekeeping operations in Nagorno 
Karabakh and in the zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict. 
  The same sources told Interfax that at the first stage the 
peacekeeping operation might be carried out only by the Russian 
units stationed in Caucasus since the Federation Council had not 
approved of the decision to send Russian "blue helmets" to this 
region. Discussion of this issue by the Federation Council was 
put off till June 21. "However, the situation may deteriorate 
if we keep waiting by this term," the sources suggested. 
  Georgian Interior Forces Commander Vladimir Chikovani said 
that the first stage of the operation on separation of the 
troops in the zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict must begin 
within the next five days after the trilateral 
(Georgian-Abkhazian-Russian) working group on deployment of 
peacekeepers in this region completed its work. Chikovani 
emphasized that military units of practically all CIS countries 
would take part in the peacekeeping operation. However, in the 
very beginning battalions from only the Leningrad, Ural and 
Privolzhsky military districts of Russia will be used. 
  IF Note: A peacekeeping battalion has been composed from 
volunteers on the basis of the Ural military district. It will 
be brought to the zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict along 
with other Russian formations, well informed sources in the 
command of the Ural district announced to Interfax. Ural 
Military District Commander, Colonel-General Yuriy Grekov 
already checked the battalion. However, no exact term for its 
introduction into the conflict zone has as yet been established.

  [Text] Moscow June 7 TASS -- Russia canceled economic 
limits on Abkhazia on May 24, 1994, bearing in mind positive 
changes in the Sukhumi stand on Georgian-Abkhazian settlement 
and the grave economic position of the Abkhazian side resulting 
from the armed conflict, head of the Russian Foreign Ministry's 
Information and Press Department Grigoriy Karasin told a 
briefing here today. 
  "Certainly, corresponding issues should be settled with due 
account of our essential stand on recognition of territorial 
integrity of the Georgian republic," said Karasin. 
  In his words, the United Nations Security Council's 
secretariat held consultations on cooperation in peace-keeping 
in Abkhazia late in May in New York. The consultations were 
held in the presence of Russia. 
  "Their main result is the end to watchfulness as regards the 
Commonwealth plans of a peace-keeping operation in Abkhazia, and 
understanding of the need for close interaction between our 
peace- makers and the U.N. mission in the conflict zone," said 
the Russian Foreign Ministry's representative.

said it was quite reasonable since every traffic must be in

  [Text] Turkey will allot a 35 million dollar-credit for 
development of Gagauzia. President of the self-proclaimed 
Gagauz Republic Stepan Topal told Interfax in an interview on 
the results of the visit of Turkish President Suleyman Demirel 
that 32 million would be utilized for supply of the region with 
drinking water and 3 million would go for development of the 
infrastructure. 
  Topal hoped that the problem concerning the political status 
of the southern Moldovan region mostly populated by Gagauz, 
would be resolved in the near future. He suggested that this 
would help to stabilize the social-political situation in the 
region and to attract foreing investments. 
  Commenting on relations with the Transdniestrian leadership, 
Topal said they remained the same and were proceeding from the 
treaty on friendship and cooperation signed in 1992. 
  The fact that Gagauzia seeks cooperation with Turkey rather 
than with Transdniestria cannot hinder our relations. "Together 
with Transdnietsria we have stood for preservation of the USSR 
and we will not refuse from cooperation with the ex-Soviet 
republics, primarily with Russia," Topal pointed out.

  [Text] New Delhi June 7 TASS -- "Our delegation's visit to 
India was successful. In the course of our negotiations with 
the Indian leaders we were able to work out a mechanism for 
achieving mutual understanding between our young Russia and the 
renovated India, and for achieving mutually acceptable 
decisions," Vice- Chairman of the Russian Government Yuriy Yarov 
told a press conference here today. He is currently visiting 
the Indian capital at the head of a high-ranking Russian 
delegation. 
  "As a result of the scrupulous work done by the two sides," 
Yarov said, "we were able to draw up a package of documents that 
are expected to be concluded at the end of Prime Minister 
Narasimha Rao's official visit to Russia at the end of June and 
the beginning of July. The agreements are practically ready to 
be signed and they cover many areas of cooperation, including 
the protection of investments, development of tourism, business 
partnership in science and technology, implementation of joint 
ecological projects and measures to protect the environment, etc. 
  Yarov did not dodge some sharp questions put to him by 
journalists about the Russo-Indian relations. He stated, for 
instance, that the results of bilateral contacts over the past 
two years were unsatisfactory. "At the present time, the trade 
turnover between our two countries amounts to 25 billion rupees 
(about 782 million U.S. dollars), which is absolutely 
insufficient. This sum has to be at least doubled by the end of 
the year," Yarov stated. 
  Asked about the irregularity of Russian deliveries of spare 
parts to the Indian armed forces, the head of the Russian 
delegation said that this was a "feeble link" in Russo-Indian 
cooperation. 
  However, on the whole, Yarov sounded quite optimistic. Asked 
by ITAR-TASS to sum up the results of the Russian delegation's 
work in India, he said: "We were able to do a lot during this 
brief period, but there is still much work ahead. On the whole, 
we are satisfied with our results. Our relations with India 
were made more dynamic. We want to be friends with India and we 
shall do our best to promote this friendship." 
  Yarov said that agreement was reached on Premier Viktor 
Chernomyrdin's visit to India, which will take place in the near 
future. 
  Yarov will be received by Indian Prime Minister Narasimha 
Rao 
today, after which the Russian delegation will leave for home.

<F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The ninth round of Russian-Moldovan talks on the 
withdrawal of Russian troops from the republic is taking place 
in Moscow today. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Diplomats and military men from 
the two states are discussing clauses in the basic agreement on 
the legal status of, procedure for, and scheduling of the 
withdrawal of Russian troops from the territory of the Republic 
of Moldova, as well as six attached agreements. According to 
the agreement, Russia will withdraw all its 50 units and 
formations, the core of which is the 14th Army, in addition to 
the 15 military units already withdrawn since November 1992. 
The troops' withdrawal should, according to the Russian 
delegation's proposal, be synchronized with political settlement 
of the Dniester conflict. This proposal met no objection from 
the Moldovan delegation. 
  The main role in settlement of the conflict is, naturally, 
being given to the Moldovan and Dniester sides. Experts have 
effectively completed the talks on the handover of the remaining 
property to Moldova and on Moldova's participation in building 
housing for Russian officers, warrant officers, and their 
families. In essence, agreement remained to be achieved on just 
one issue: 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified Russian officer, in 
progress] 
...to determine the precise schedule for the withdrawal of our 
troops -- either a calendar schedule, by some date or other, or 
an overall one, over a specific period. We are now proposing a 
period of three years. 
  [Unidentified civilian] On this, we politicians should heed 
the view of the military, who decide the organizational and 
tactical processes, the scheduling, and so on. I think we'll 
find a compromise even on such a difficult issue. [end recording] 
  [Correspondent] The progress of the talks is giving rise to 
hopes that the package of documents could be agreed tomorrow at 
the expert level and passed to the governments for 
consideration.

<F P=106> [Yuriy Nikolayev report: "AL-QUDS Receives Guests"] </F>
  [Text] The start of the Palestine Days in Moscow and the 
festival of the AL-QUDS newspaper was marred by another 
provocation against this publication. On Friday night 
Muscovites and visitors to the capital who were heading for the 
Central Tourist Office in Leninskiy Prospekt were stopped by 
militia cordons and volunteer forces. The bewildered 
participants in the planned ceremonies were told: We have found 
out that an explosive device has been planted in the concert 
hall of the Tourist Office, and you are not allowed to go in 
there.... The plan was simple: Of course people would not go 
in if there was a bomb there, they would stand about at the 
entrance for a while, and then go away. However, the organizers 
of the provocation miscalculated. 
  Later, when it was established that there were no explosive 
devices there, the assembled company filled the capacious hall 
to overflowing.... 
  The festival went on for three days, and each of these days 
ended with soirees at the Central Tourist Office. And I can say 
with certainty that these soirees left the guests and the hosts 
with nothing but good impressions. From talking to the 
initiator of the festival, the publisher of the AL-QUDS (Holy 
City) newspaper, Doctor Shaaban Khafiz Shaaban. From the 
conversations and speeches of famous Russian politicians and 
public figures. Ruslan Khasbulatov, Ilya Konstantinov, Stanislav 
Terekhov, Yegor Ligachev, Sazhi Umalatova, Vladislav Achalov, 
and Valentin Chikin...were greeted warmly and sincerely by the 
meeting participants. Maybe Aleksandr Nevzorov got more 
applause than the others, but there is an explanation for this. 
First, the participants in the festivities greeted him as a 
State Duma deputy and then as a famous television journalist, 
and then they greeted his first movie, "Miracle-working," on the 
bloody events of October 1993.... 
  Artistes Aleksandr Vedernikov, Ivan Yakushin, Valentin 
Tsvetkov, Tamara Kartintseva, and Tatyana Filimonova, and 
amateur Palestinian and Russian ensembles certainly enhanced 
these soirees and gave people a lot of pleasure.

<F P=106> [Report by Viktor Belikov: "Small Business in the Capital </F>
Under the Guardianship of Moscow's Government"] 
  [Text] One quarter of all Russia's small enterprises are 
now concentrated in Moscow, and in the coming 18 months the 
local authorities intend to double their number. This is the 
aim of the citywide comprehensive program for the development 
and support of small business adopted by the capital's 
government. 
  Officially, a small business is deemed to be one which 
employs between 15 (trade, everyday services) and 200 
(construction, industry) workers. It might appear as if these 
mini production units and small firms have very few jobs to 
offer, but there are tens of thousands of them in the city -- 
and this constitutes a sizable part of Moscow's economy and a 
major factor of stability in the social climate. 
  The citywide program defines the priority spheres for small 
business in Moscow: Namely, the production and sale of 
foodstuffs and consumer goods, everyday services, health care, 
city amenities and garbage clearance, the development of the 
tourist sector, and services for visitors. In the first quarter 
of this year 3.5 billion [rubles] of the city's money was spent 
on supporting those who decided to take on these concerns. As 
of next year, the subsidy will make up 0.5 percent of the entire 
Moscow budget. 
  So where exactly will these considerable resources go? Over 
the next 18 months in virtually all municipal districts it is 
planned to set up 60 mini-bakeries, 35 new workshops for 
repairing household appliances, 14 breweries, 10 small meat 
processing plants, 6 timber processing plants, 6 knitwear 
production units, 9 construction units, and 10 garbage 
collection subdivisions. Apart from the city's money, resources 
are also being attracted from public associations of 
entrepreneurs. In return for assisting in setting up a small 
business, their senior colleagues will be granted concessions in 
payments for rented premises, power, heat, and water, and they 
will be exempt from certain municipal taxes -- all according to 
the "rules of the game" in a market economy. 
  A Moscow Fund for the Support of Small Business is being set 
up -- its tasks are as follows: To train skilled personnel 
(there is a dire shortage of competent accountants, economists, 
and legal experts!); to create databases; and to publish the 
information and analysis yearbook "Moscow Small Business." The 
fund has also been tasked with organizing a specialized science 
park [tekhnopark], possibly on the basis of the former 
Exhibition of National Economic Achievements, to elaborate 
promising projects which can then be realized by small 
businesses. 
  A great help to existing and newly created entrepreneurial 
structures is the Moscow Leasing Company, which acquires 
technological equipment and then rents it out to small 
enterprises in priority sectors and creates "turnkey" production 
units that are ready to roll.

  [Text] Vladikavkaz June 7 TASS -- "The Caucasus should be 
viewed as a single whole, local processes influence the 
public-political situation in the Russian south," Russian 
Minister for Nationalities and Regional Policy Nikolay Yegorov 
told a meeting here today. 
  The meeting was attended by North Ossetian President 
Akhsarbek Galazov, North Ossetian Government and Presidium 
members, head of temporary administration Vladimir Lozovoy and 
representatives of federal ministries currently in the state of 
emergency zone to discuss the implementation of presidential 
decrees and governmental instructions on the return of refugees 
and forced migrants to places of their permanent residence. 
  In the opinion of Yegorov, developments in the conflict zone 
influence the whole North-Caucasian region, and the refugee 
problem should be solved with due account of this situation. He 
stressed that the North Ossetian-Ingush relations should be 
settled only peacefully and without the use of force. 
  Yegorov, Lozovoy and members of the North Ossetian 
Government 
visited the state of emergency zone this morning to meet local 
residents. 
  The minister has left Vladikavkaz.

  [Text] Groznyy says that the only way to overcome the 
present stalemate is to hold "a well-prepared meeting between 
the presidents of Chechnya and Russia," a spokesman for the 
press service of President Dzhokhar Dudayev told Interfax on 
Tuesday. Preparations for such talks must be conducted "without 
political intrigues on the part of some aides to President Boris 
Yeltsin," he pointed out. 
  In comments on the statement by the head of the Russian 
president's office, Sergey Filatov, to the effect that after 
Dudayev's sharp anti-Russian pronouncements a further dialogue 
with Groznyy is impossible, the high-ranking member of the 
Chechen president's office said that Sergey Filatov "laid the 
blame for the disruption of negotiations on the wrong side." 
"It's no longer a secret that Russia had no intention of 
starting talks in earnest. It only wanted an excuse for 
launching another propagandistic ploy," he pointed out. 
  "In what other way, in Filatov's view, could President 
Dudayev react a few hours after an attempt on his life?" the 
official asked. 
  A statement released by Dudayev's press service on Tuesday 
says that "Filatov's explanations as to the reasons why the 
talks were delayed are so flimsy that comments on them are 
unnecessary." "They are designed to conceal Russia's 
unwillingness to enter into truly civilized talks" with 
Chechnya, the press service declared.

  [Text] The Chechen opposition, which understands that 
Chechnya's leadership will not voluntarily refuse from power, 
does not rule out that coercive methods can be used to solve the 
conflict, the headquarters of the opposition situated in the 
republic's Nadterechny region reported to Interfax Tuesday. 
They made it clear that the political forces opposing President 
Dzhokhar Dudayev would resort to coercive measures only in case 
that the official formations in Groznyy are the first to use 
arms. 
  A representative of the headquarters who preferred to stay 
anonymous declared that last Sunday the opposition manage to 
conduct its congress in the regional center of Znamenskoe. As 
many as 2500 delegates were present at the congress. 
  However, as Groznyy reports, the opposition's congress was 
disrupted because the majority of those invited to the congress 
boycotted it. 
  Meanwhile, the congress' delegate Ruslan Martagov told our 
Interfax correspondent that the congress took place despite a 
tough confrontation on the part of Groznyy. 
  In his words, the congress urged that Chechen President 
Dzhokhar Dudayev and Vice President Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev should 
immediately resign and the republic's parliament should pass a 
decision on democratic elections. According to the opposition, 
this decision should be adopted before June 15 and then the 
parliament should announce about its self-disbandment. 
  As the opposition believes, new elections should be held not 
later than August 1994. The authorities should release all 
political prisoners and transfer all authorities to the 
Temporary Council of the Chechen Republic being created by the 
opposition. 
  The resolution adopted by the congress underlines that the 
Temporary Council created in winter 1994 takes all the functions 
of the representative power until the time of the new elections.

  [Text] Russia must have only one president, said Yuriy 
Spiridonov, the recently elected head of the Komi Republic. He 
told Interfax in an exclusive interview on the eve of the 
inauguration ceremony that the Komi leaders had turned down the 
idea of instituting the post of president in their republic. 
"We are an inalienable part of the Russian Federation," he 
said. "Even if the leaders of the republics and regions are 
elected by the people, they must not be called presidents, he 
added. 
  To quote Spiridonov, the Constitution of the Komi Republic 
provides the local parliament with sufficient rights to control 
the head of the government. "A president does not head either 
the legislative or the executive bodies. He is above both, so 
it is not the president that we are electing. The head of the 
Komi Republic directly runs the government, the responsibility 
he bears is much greater than that of the president of any 
republic," he said. 
  He expressed regret that the new Russian Constitution does 
not contain the Federation Treaty. This makes the Center and 
the constituent entities conclude a bilateral agreement in each 
particular instance, said Spiridonov.

  [Text] At a parliamentary session Tuesday, Tatar President 
Mintimer Shaymiyev spoke in favor of the government's 
anti-crisis program and against its resignation. 
  "If until now the government has succeeded in easing the 
situation by half-measures, then radical steps are needed now 
necessitated by the Russian leadership's tougher line for 
keeping down inflation which puts the question of surviving 
before enterprises," he said. 
  Shaymiyev added that Tatarstan needed a long-term economic 
program which would be developed with the participation of 
foreign experts by this autumn. "While now the government should 
be allowed to implement its proposals which will give it a 
possibility to survive," he said. 
  In his opinion, the government should in the first place 
support the oil-extracting industry as lowering volumes were the 
main reason for a 30-percent production drop in the republic. 
  Among other top-priority measures to stabilize the economic 
situation, Shaymiyev indicated regulating the movement of 
capital, forming independent credit resources, refusing 
expensive credits of the Central Bank of Russia, promoting the 
circulation of bills of exchange inside Tatarstan, developing a 
program to support entrepreneurship and forming the market of 
real estate. 
  Shayiyev pointed out that the power-sharing treaty between 
Russia and Tatarstan was instrumental in solving existing 
differences rather than in completely removing them. During 
Boris Yeltsin's recent visit to Kazan, the republic had managed 
to draw Russia in such major federal projects as the renovation 
of KamAZ, the construction of a car-making plant in Yelabuga and 
an oil-processing plant in Nizhnekamsk as well as a number of 
military conversion programs, he said.

  [Text] Large-scale operations to combat organized 
crime will commence in Vladivostok in the first days of 
June. 
  This was stated at a news conference last Friday by Vladimir 
Ipatov, chief of the kray's Internal Affairs Administration. 
Additional forces of the militia will be pulled in from other 
cities and rayons of the kray. It is planned in the very near 
future to organize inspections of the gang "haunts" and secret 
addresses and the motor transport and papers of all suspects, 
which will last for several months. 
  So concentrated an assault on the city's crime is connected 
with the events that occurred at the end of last week and the 
start of this, when several militia officers were killed and 
wounded. In retaliation, 145 persons were detained and eight 
guns and seven radios were confiscated in literally a matter of 
days. The militia officers arrested 45 persons at a gathering of 
crime groupings, at which narcotics, weapons, $55,000, and 
approximately R50 million were confiscated.

<F P=106> [Financial Department report: "Paratroopers Are Sponsored </F>
by a Novosibirsk Bank"] 
  [Text] Large regional banks, persistently seeking to 
penetrate the Moscow market, are resorting to very unorthodox 
methods to assert themselves. Thus, Moscow branch directors of 
a leading Novosibirsk bank -- the Siberian Trade Bank -- on 5 
June signed an agreement with the Russian Paratroopers Command 
effectively establishing the bank's "sponsorship" of the 
paratroopers. 
  The agreement between the Siberian Trade Bank and the 
paratroopers envisions, in particular, preferential bank 
servicing and crediting of the paratroopers subdivisions and 
individuals as well as the provision of financial assistance to 
officers' families. The agreement establishes among the basic 
targeted programs "financing by the bank of house and apartment 
construction for officers transferred from neighboring states, 
civilian training courses for retired military, and also 
assistance to military servicemen, and their facilities, who 
have found themselves in extreme conditions." For their part, 
the paratroopers undertake to train personnel for the bank's 
security service. 
  This agreement with the paratroopers is the first action by 
the Siberian Trade Bank Moscow branch. Such an unusual 
beginning of the branch's activity is quite explicable. With 
tough competition on the Moscow financial market, regional banks 
are hard put to make a name for themselves here by confining 
themselves to providing "common" banking services to their 
clients.

<F P=106> [Yuriy Rytov report: "Food Prices. They Are Not Regulated </F>
at Federal Level, But Regional Regulation Exists and Is 
Producing Good Results"] 
  [Text] As is well known, the state now no longer sets 
prices for any goods -- be they industrial or consumer goods. 
(With the exception of energy prices.) But the regions are 
entitled to regulate food prices. 
  And, in my view, this rule has been very successful -- and 
entirely justified -- in many areas. Provided, needless to say, 
that the bare formula of reform is not followed, but is given 
some real content. 
  This April there was price regulation of foodstuffs in 104 
cities (out of the 132 surveyed by the Russian Federation State 
Committee for Statistics). 
  Needless to say, the level of influence exerted by the local 
administration on price regulation varied from region to region. 
Thus, in the cities of the Volga-Vyatka and North Caucasus 
regions prices of all the most important foodstuffs were 
regulated. In the Northern and Northwest regions this process 
was restricted to a few cities -- Cherepovets, Pskov, and the 
cities of the Komi Republic. 
  I would like to quote a few figures from the Russian 
Federation State Committee for Statistics which show just what 
foodstuffs were of particular concern to local administrations. 
  Milk prices were regulated in 69 percent of the cities 
surveyed by the Russian Federation State Committee for 
Statistics. Beef prices were regulated in 45 percent of cities, 
and cooked sausage prices in 42 percent. 
  The question naturally arises -- just how do local 
administrations manage to hold down price growth? 
  The most widespread form of price regulation (around 50 
percent of all price regulation) is to limit the size of trading 
organizations' markups. The profitability of food industry 
enterprises is controlled in approximately 5 percent of cities. 
  Consequently, there are some sharp difference in food prices 
in different regions. For instance, in mid-May the average cost 
of a basket of 19 of the most important foodstuffs was 51,100 
rubles [R] (over the month). The price of the same basket in 
Moscow was more than R55,000. The basket is still cheapest in 
Ulyanovsk -- at R30,000. It is slightly more in Chistopol 
(R35,000) and Lipetsk (R36,000).

<F P=106> [Lyudmila Bildyugina report under the "Regional Policy" </F>
rubric: "Buy and Sell, As Long As It Is Not Land. Letter to 
the Russian President"] 
  [Text] Stavropol Kray -- The Stavropol Kray State Duma has 
sent a letter to Russian Federation President B. Yeltsin and the 
Russian Federation Federal Assembly "requesting that legislation 
permitting the purchase and sale of land should not be 
implemented and that components of the Federation should be 
granted the right to independently determine the procedure for 
regulating land relations on sub-departmental territory." 
  In the letter, which was adopted unanimously, the deputies 
attribute their request to the fact that the State Duma is 
extremely worried about the sociopolitical situation prevailing 
in the kray in connection with the upcoming adoption of 
legislation regulating land relations in the purchase and sale 
of plots of land. 
  At present, representatives of over 200 nations and 
nationalities live on the kray's territory, and many of them 
have settled in ethnic population centers. The purchase and 
sale of land could lead to a change in the existing ethnic 
status quo and exacerbate already tense relations. Furthermore, 
peoples for whom land has never been in private ownership 
(Cossacks, Turkmens, Nogai, and others) live on the kray's 
territory in close-knit communities. 
  The implementation of the purchase and sale of land, the 
deputies are convinced, could lead to a loss of ethnic control 
of a priceless asset of the Russian people, that is, Mineralnyye 
Vody in the Caucasus. 
  The Stavropol Kray State Duma believes that land and other 
natural resources may be held in state, municipal, or private 
ownership. However, the right to buy and sell should be 
extended only to truck garden and dacha plots, as well as to 
land occupied by structures and buildings which are privately 
owned. 
  It can be said with a great degree of certainty that the 
State Duma deputies' view corresponds to the mass mood of the 
Stavropol population, almost half of which is rural. The basis 
for this conclusion is a kind of referendum on the question 
conducted among kray inhabitants by the popular newspaper 
STAVROPOLSKAYA PRAVDA, which has been publishing the most varied 
opinions over a long period of time under the "Land and Will" 
rubric, including those of ordinary private farmers, kolkhoz 
chiefs, agriculture specialists, leaders of administrations, and 
pensioners in the city and in the country.... The editorial 
office also familiarized its readers with the stance of 
supporters and opponents of private ownership of land living in 
other regions of the country. Statistics and the analysis of 
the opinions and readers' responses which the editorial office 
carried out make it possible to draw the simple conclusion. 
  Many specialists in Stavropol believe that the squandering 
of 
the land stock must be prevented, that it would be best of all 
to use plots of land as social shock-absorbers -- as a kind of 
compensation for the socioeconomic losses that Russians have 
suffered in consequence of the shock without therapy. This 
would ease social tension today in many respects and help 
compensate for the sharp depreciation in the population's 
financial investments and other securities.

<F P=106> [Valeriy Kornev report: "Private Radio Station Opens in </F>
Volgograd"] 
  [Text] Volgograd -- Volgograd has become one of the first 
of the province's major cities whose residents will now be able 
to listen to alternative radio every day -- broadcasts from the 
"Novaya Volna" [New Wave] radio station. Broadcasts are 
currently from 0700 through 2200, and in the near future they 
will be around the clock. 
  A powerful autonomous transmitter makes it possible to cover 
a number of rural areas as well as the oblast center. 
  "Although the bulk of the time is devoted to music 
programs," 
Aleksey Kuimov, general director of "Novaya Volna," says, "we 
are also devoting paramount attention to timely new reporting. 
There is a summary of the latest news every hour. Our 
correspondents phone in their reports from the scene. We will 
also be staging a kind of talk show, giving representatives of 
parties and entrepreneurs a chance to say their piece." 
  It is worth noting that the co-owners of the new radio 
station -- apart from the well-known "Tsaritsyn Dvor" trading 
and industrial firm -- include professional media journalists 
whom Volgograders know well from broadcasts on the local "South 
of Russia" cable tv.

  [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk today received 
DPRK Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] The Ukrainian president warmly 
greeted the DPRK's delegation led by Foreign Minister Kim 
Yong-nam. The DPRK was one of the world's first countries to 
recognize Ukraine's independence and to establish diplomatic 
relations with it. 
  During a conversation, Leonid Kravchuk informed the Korean 
guests of the present situation in Ukraine and stressed that it 
is stable. Out state's president noted that political battles 
are being fought in Ukraine, but added that there is no acute 
confrontation. On the issue of Crimea, Leonid Kravchuk 
reiterated it is being settled within the framework of 
constitutional methods. 
  The Korean side expressed interest in developing cooperation 
with Ukraine. Issues of mutual interest to both states were 
discussed. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko took part 
in the conversation. 
  The DPRK delegation, led by Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam, 
was today also received by Oleksandr Tkachenko, first deputy 
chairman of the Ukrainian Supreme Council, who told the guests 
about the activity of Ukraine's new democratically elected 
parliament. The quests were acquainted with the specialist work 
being carried out by the Ukrainian Parliament, which is 
fatefully entrusted with resolving many problems in order to 
pull the economy out of a crisis, and improve the social 
security of Ukraine's population at a hard time of market 
reforms. 
  I note that agreements on trade, economic, and scientific 
and 
technological cooperation were concluded between Ukraine and the 
DPRK last year. The Korean side today takes interest in signing 
such interstate documents as a treaty on friendship and 
cooperation, agreements on cultural relations, legal assistance, 
and other documents which would promote bilateral ties. 
  Anatoliy Zlenko and Borys Oliynyk, chairman of the Ukrainian 
Supreme Council Foreign affairs and CIS Relations Commission, 
took part in the conversation.

invitation to visit North Korea and said "the date of this visit 
will be coordinated in the near future."

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F>
Mikhail Melnik] 
  [Text] Kiev 8 June TASS -- During his official visit to 
Ukraine, North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam avoided 
assessing the initiative of Russia, which moved to settle the 
Korean problem at an international conference. 
  "It is premature to speak about an international conference 
on the nuclear programme of the Korean People's Democratic 
Republic [People's Democratic Republic of Korea]. Russia's 
initiative is yet in the state of examination," he told 
ITAR-TASS here on Tuesday [7 June]. The minister avoided further 
comments on this subject. He said that he would touch in 
greater detail on the problem during his rounding off press 
conference, which is to be held here on Wednesday afternoon. 
  In light of the crisis on the Korean peninsula, Russia has 
moved to call an international conference with the participation 
of the two Korean states, the U.S.A., Japan, China, Russia, the 
United Nations, and the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
  Dwelling on the state of Ukrainian-Korean relations, Kim 
Yong-nam noted during his talk with First Vice-Speaker of the 
Ukrainian Parliament Aleksandr Tkachenko that "the KPDR [DPRK] 
leadership was a dependable partner of Ukraine on the 
international arena. The Korean People's Democratic Republic 
wholly backs Ukraine's efforts to build up an independent and 
democratic state. It is sure that Ukraine will assume a worthy 
place in the world community." The North Korean foreign 
minister positively assessed the decision of the Ukrainian state 
to become a nuclear-free power. 
  The minister highly praised Ukraine's foreign policy, 
because 
it "comes out for the solution of all the existing problems 
through negotiations and on the basis of international norms." 
He thanked the Ukrainian side for its "support to the plan to 
reunify North and South Korea by peaceful means." Tkachenko 
described the visit of the Korean delegation as "a continuation 
of the efforts to strengthen friendship between the two 
countries and to consolidate the legal foundation for further 
mutually advantageous cooperation between the two countries." 
Thanking the minister for the invitation to visit North Korea, 
he said that "the date of the trip would be decided shortly." 
  Different aspects of cooperation between Ukraine and the 
Korean People's Democratic Republic were also discussed during 
Kim Yong- sam's meeting with Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk. The latter noted that Ukraine was making important 
steps towards the implementation of its nuclear-free status. He 
said the internal situation in the country was stable.

  [Text] Kiev, 7 Jun -- Volodymyr Kryzhanivskyy, Ukraine's 
ambassador to the Russian Federation, met with the director of 
the Russian Foreign Ministry cooperation department and handed 
him two notes from the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, drawing 
attention to the report by the head of the Russian delegation at 
the CSCE standing committee's plenary sitting in Vienna where 
the question of the situation in the Republic of Crimea was 
addressed. Ukraine's Foreign Ministry, in particular, pointed 
out that the report referred to the existence of the sovereign 
Republic of Crimea within Ukraine. The Ukrainian Foreign 
Ministry qualifies this as nothing other than a statement 
contradicting the Russian Federation's official position on the 
issue of respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and 
existing borders of Ukraine and regards it as interfering in 
Ukraine's internal affairs. This was a statement made by Yuriy 
Serheyev, head of the information directorate at Ukraine's 
Foreign Ministry at a briefing. 
  In connection with the Ambartsumov's deliberations published 
by LITERATURNAYA GAZETA, the Ukrainian Embassy in Russia issued 
another note pointing out that, according to the embassy's data, 
Mr. Ambartsumov has been appointed as an extraordinary and 
plenipotentiary ambassador of Russia. The following question 
arises: Do Ambartsumov's statements that the USSR's acts on the 
integration of Crimean Oblast in Ukraine are unlawful, that the 
Russian Federation Supreme Council's notorious decision on the 
status of the city of Sevastopol is incorrect and that the 
borders between our states are not final, correspond to the 
Russian Federation's official stance?

<F P=106> [Report by Konstantin Parishkura under the "Peninsula" </F>
rubric: "Sevastopol Will Remain Russian Naval Base"] 
  [Text] "The experts have managed mainly to complete work 
on dividing the water craft of the Black Sea Fleet into 
classes," said Vice Admiral Volodymyr Beskorovaynyy, commander 
of the Ukrainian Navy, upon the completion of talks between 
Ukrainian and Russian delegations on the problems of the Black 
Sea Fleet in Sevastopol. The experts' conclusions have not been 
officially formulated yet, while Vice Prime Minister Valeriy 
Shmarov, head of the Ukrainian delegation, told journalists that 
Sevastopol will definitely remain a base of the Russian 
Federation Navy following a corresponding legal procedure. The 
location where Kiev will receive ships after the division of the 
Black Sea Fleet is yet unknown, although Donuzlav is being named 
as the most probable port. 
  In the meantime it has become known that a joint working 
group of Ukrainian and Russian parliamentarians is supposed to 
submit proposals before 15 June on harmonizing the constitutions 
and legislation of both sides. The Ukrainian delegation and the 
working group of the Crimean Supreme Soviet have appealed to 
President Kravchuk and Ukraine's parliament to introduce no 
sanctions before this date for not acting on the decree calling 
for bringing Crimea's laws into line with those of Ukraine. The 
sides urged the presidents and parliamentarians of Ukraine and 
Crimea "not to take unlawful, uncoordinated actions in regard of 
the power structures responsible for the maintenance of law and 
order in Crimea." 
  On 6 June the presidium of Crimea's Supreme Soviet appointed 
Vladimir Karpov, adviser to the president of Crimea, head of the 
joint working group that will draft and submit proposals on 
bringing the republic's laws into line with those of Ukraine. 
His candidacy is supposed to be up for confirmation at today's 
session of the Supreme Soviet of Crimea when the deputies hear a 
report on the results of the talks with the Ukrainian delegation.

"`National Credit' Will Be Financing Black Sea Fleet"] 
  [Text] Valeriy Baranov, administrator of affairs of the 
Russian "National Credit" bank, and Viktor Semenov, head of the 
Sevastopol administration, agreed on 7 June to open in the city 
an agency of the bank which is to be turned into its permanent 
branch in a month. 
  A limited partnership, "National Credit" is an authorized 
bank of the Moscow government. Its founders are the "Olbi" 
concern, the "Interkoys" joint venture, the "Mezhdunarodnyye 
Otnosheniya" publishing house, the Savings Bank of Russia, and 
the "Industriya Service" bank. Its start-up capital is 37 
billion rubles. 
  The decision to open a "National Credit" branch in 
Sevastopol 
was made under the Russian-Ukrainian agreements on financing for 
the Black Sea Fleet. Mr. Baranov stated that the bank intends 
to introduce new types of services on the territory of Ukraine 
in line with the laws of Ukraine or Crimea depending on which 
will register it. "National Credit" is to function in Ukraine 
as a foreign bank whose chartered fund at the time of 
registration stands at 10 million European Currency Units. If 
the Russian authorities set the promised 52 billion rubles aside 
for Sevastopol, the start-up capital of "National Credit" would 
grow to match this figure. "National Credit" is expected to take 
the niche of the Dnepropetrovsk "Privat Bank," which up to 
recently acted as an intermediary in the transfer of Russian 
money to the Black Sea Fleet. 
  According to bank representatives, the opening of the branch 
does not signify turning Sevastopol into a ruble zone oasis. It 
is still not clear in which currency Black Sea Fleet sailors 
will be paid. 
  The same day a cable came to Sevastopol from Ukraine's 
Finance Ministry saying that Kiev has set aside for the city a 
preferential credit to the tune of 50 billion karbovanets.

<F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature, May 30-Jun 5 94] </F>
  [Text] A Russo-Ukrainian joint stock society expected to be 
set up in late 1994 to expand Ukraine's transit gas pipeline 
network. A tentative agreement to the above effect was reached 
as a result of negotiations in Kiev on 1-3 June involving 
Russia's Gazprom and the Ukrgazprom. 
  The decision is probably in perfect harmony with the Russian 
Gazprom joint-stock society's strategic program dubbed "Highly 
Reliable Pipe-Line Transport," which was discussed in Moscow in 
March with active participation of Ukrainian experts including 
academician Boris Paton himself, president of the Ukrainian 
Academy of Sciences and the world's top-notch authority in the 
domain of arc welding. Mr. Paton has been personally supervising 
the program's major section, which involves anti-corrosion 
agents and corrosion-resistant equipment (see UBN no. 14/1994). 
  In the meantime, on 27 April 1994, the Ukrainian State 
Committee for oil and gas made a decision to set up the 
Ukrgazprom (Ukrainian Gas Industry) joint-stock society, by way 
of an experiment, based on the existent Ukrgazpromstroi 
(Ukrainian Gas Industry Construction) and as the latter's 
affiliate, through a merger of the industry's construction 
enterprises in East Ukraine. 
  Obviously enough, Ukraine's jurisdiction over a part of the 
former USSR's integral gas pipe-line system does not relieve 
Russia, as the world's major natural gas exporter, from the 
burden of troubles involved in maintaining the gas piping 
system's technical standards and its improvement and expansion. 
  Russia's lawmakers continue hearings involving a law on 
pipe-line transport, which reportedly has triggered considerable 
controversy among the interested parties. Russia's strategic 
program was drafted and basically approved by the former USSR's 
government back in 1991. Its practical implementation started a 
year later. 
  However, after the USSR's disintegration, it was approved by 
both the Russian and Ukrainian governments on an governmental 
basis, though its financing by the Ukrainian party virtually 
discontinued, despite the fact that Ukraine accounts for the 
bulk of theoretical, R&amp;D and feasibility studies involved in 
the 
program. 
  Nonetheless, Ukraine intends to finalize and implement on 
its 
own a national program, which has been dubbed Ukraine's Highly 
Reliably Pipe-Line Transport, and which is based on recent 
intergovernmental agreements. 
  The CIS's major pipe-line system is 220,000 km.-long. Its 
compressor stations' aggregate capacity is estimated at 50 
million kW. According to Russia's Gazprom, 138,000 km.-long. 
pipe-lines are presently operational Russia-wide. Major 
pipe-lines' wear and tear status poses as a major environmental 
threat with 25 per cent of pipe-lines having been operational 
for over two decades, 5 per cent for over the critical 33 year 
period, and 38 per cent for periods between one and two decades, 
and thus in bad need of repair and reconstruction. 
  According to the Ukrainian State Committee for oil and gas, 
Ukraine's 35,800 km.-long pipe-lines are operational. Besides, 
the Druzhba (Friendship) and Samara petroleum export pipe-line 
systems are located in Ukraine, plus 70,000 km.-long pipe-lines 
of Ukraine's domestic distribution system and about 5,000 
km.-long petroleum and product pipe-lines (a total of five 
systems including two exclusively export ones). Ukraine's 14 
gas pipe-lines can transport 266 b. cu. m. of natural gas a year. 
  According to experts with the Ukrainian Research Institute 
for gas piping, Ukraine's national major pipe-line network does 
not require any sizable expansion. However, its domestic 
distribution system and major pipe-lines' branches should be 
developed to stabilize natural gas supplies primarily to 
Ukraine's three large industrial regions, to wit, the Kharkov, 
Donetsk and Transdnieprian regions. Besides, the existent 
network is not an integrated system, which would allow to 
optimally and efficiently redistribute fuel flows both within 
Ukraine and intended for exports. 
  Experts with the Ukrainian oil and gas industry are 
currently 
drafting feasibility studies and relevant legislative acts for 
the Ukrainian Pipe-Line Transport project.

<F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature, 30 May-5 Jun 94] </F>
  [Text] During the 27 May through 1 June period 311.9 
million cu. m. of Turkmen natural gas were piped to Ukraine 
instead of the planned 384.5 million cu. m. amount. 
  According to Ukrgazprom's maintenance-dispatching service, 
in 
this way 1,207.6 million cu. m. of natural gas failed to be 
piped to Ukraine, as of early June. 
  Meanwhile, Russia's natural gas exporter has kept piping 
extra amounts of natural gas to Ukraine. Thus, within the 27 
May-1 June period Russia exported 2,869.9 million cu. m. of 
natural gas, almost 42 million cu. m. of which were in excess of 
the agreed amount. All-in-all, 541.5 million cu. m. of extra 
natural gas amounts were piped to Ukraine, as of early June 1994. 
  According to Yevgeni Sukhin, first deputy chairperson of the 
Ukrainian State Committee for oil and gas, Russia's stable 
supplies allowed Ukrgazprom to store about 17 b. cu. m. of 
natural gas in underground facilities by late May, some portion 
of which stock will belong to Ukraine. As Yevgeni Sukhin 
maintains, if Russia and Turkmenistan continue their supplies at 
present rates, Ukraine will be able to catch up with its gas 
storaging schedule, currently keeping at an over forthnight's 
time-lag, which is about 25 per cent lower versus 1993's 
respective amount, though it will be a hard job. 
  Ukraine's domestic gas consumption has been much lower, than 
normally with late May's averaged daily consumption rate of 195 
million cu. m. versus April's 240 million cu. m. According to 
Mr. Sukhin, April's gas consumption cost Ukraine $7 million a 
day with 1,000 cu. m. of natural gas priced at $50, even 
considering Ukraine's domestic extraction of 50 million cu. m. 
of the above amount. Gas transit piping charges cost Ukraine 
additional $50 million. 
  January's daily consumption of natural gas was as high as 
320 
million cu. m. During the 27 May-1 June period of 1994, 
Ukrainian domestic consumers utilized 979 million cu. m. of 
natural gas versus the planned 1,319.5 million cu. m. figure. 
According to Ukrgazprom, 2,150.1 million cu. m. of natural gas 
was saved to be piped to reserve stocks, due to suspended gas 
supplies to debtor- enterprises.

  [Text] Kiev [no date as received] -- UNIAN reported 
yesterday that Valeriy Kuznetsov, Crimea's internal affairs 
minister, met in an isolation remand cell with Citizen Rayil 
Khayrov who is accused of the November 1993 murder of Crimean 
Tatar leader Yuriy Osmanov. 
  The main public relations center of Ukraine's Internal 
Affairs Ministry assessed these actions by Valeriy Kuznetsov, 
whom Ukraine's Internal Affairs Ministry does not recognize as 
head of the Crimean militia, as illegal. 
  Ukraine's Internal Affairs Ministry's official explanation 
stresses that "R.K. Khayrov, born in 1968, was previously 
sentenced to two years of corrective labor. He is presently 
being held criminally liable in accordance with Article 93 `A' 
(murder for mercenary motives) and Article 42 (robbery with 
assault) of Ukraine's criminal code for the murder of Citizen 
Osmanov Yu. B., committed on 6 November 1993. 
  Notwithstanding that the defendant committed the gravest 
crime against an individual and in disregard of existing norms 
and regulations, V. Ye. Kuznetsov issued an instruction to bring 
Khayrov out of the cell where he was in detention, into an 
individual office for a meeting with him. The employees of the 
isolation remand center were ordered to leave the premises 
immediately. The private conversation between V.Ye. Kuznetsov 
and the defendant lasted for six minutes. Thus, by his actions 
he grossly violated Article 12 of the law of Ukraine "On 
preliminary confinement," Article 162 of the Criminal Procedural 
Code of Ukraine, and also a number of clauses of the instruction 
on the procedure for detaining individuals taken into custody 
and defendants in isolation remand cells of Ukraine's Ministry 
of Internal Affairs. In accordance with these normative acts, 
V. Ye. Kuznetsov, even if he were a minister, did not have the 
right to such a meeting with Khayrov without written permission 
from the Republic of Crimea's Supreme Court, which is currently 
examining this matter. 
  In arranging a personal meeting with the defendant, V. Ye. 
Kuznetsov exceeded his official authority, which could lead to a 
leak of investigation secrets and other negative consequences. 
There is not a single doubt that this was done purposefully, 
consciously, and intentionally. The disdain and self-seeking of 
V. Ye. Kuznetsov in achieving his intentions are also undoubted. 
  While addressing occasional recommendations to the personnel 
of the Republic of Crimea's internal affairs bodies to abide by 
legality and the provision of law and order, in practice he is 
insolently disregarding the current laws of Ukraine."

  [Text] Kiev -- Volodymyr Butkevych, head of the working 
group of Ukraine's Supreme Council, which is in Crimea and head 
of the Supreme Council Commission of Human Rights, National 
Minorities, and Interethnic Relations, and a UN expert on human 
rights, has said at a news conference that during the joint 
Ukrainian and Crimean parliamentary working group's trip to 
Crimea, a base was created for the peaceful settlement of the 
current problems. He refused to qualify the situation with 
Crimea as a "conflict," a "dispute," or a "constitutional 
crisis," but only as a situation that has arisen because of the 
nonconformity of Ukraine's legislation with that of the 
autonomous republic. Volodymyr Butkevych gave assurances that 
there no particular claims and demands were made by either side 
during the talks. Difficulties only arose because both sides 
have a different interpretation of the same articles of the law. 
  In his words, the results of the working group's stay in 
Crimea are set out in a document which contains a provision on 
the nonconformity of some legislative acts of the Supreme 
Council of Crimea with Ukrainian legislation. The working 
commissions of both parliaments should, within two weeks (by 15 
June), submit proposals with regard to this for consideration by 
the two Supreme Councils. 
  The joint working group asked the parliaments of Ukraine and 
Crimea to refrain from actions that could influence the 
commission's work, and also asked president Meshkov of Crimea to 
contribute to the commission's work. 
  In the words of Volodymyr Butkevych, the working group, 
headed by Volodymyr Stretovych, chairman of the Supreme Council 
Commission for Issues of Legal Policy and Judicial and Legal 
Reform, left today for Crimea in order to continue coordinating 
the work. 
  In reply to a question whether Volodymyr Butkevych could 
foresee the possibility of a referendum in Crimea on its 
secession from Ukraine, he said that, according to international 
law, a change in the public power in Crimea is the prerogative 
of the entire Ukrainian people. A plebiscite of the whole 
Ukrainian population and not a referendum of just the Crimean 
population should be held on this. 
  Speaking about the possibility of recognizing the Majles of 
the Crimean Tatar people as a body of higher authority in 
Crimea, Volodymyr Butkevych noted that even the UN [United 
Nations] does not have a common viewpoint on whether an 
indigenous population has a right to self-determination on its 
historical homeland. Opponents of such a viewpoint argue that 
almost all conflicts in the world have erupted on these grounds. 
Volodymyr Butkevych noted that in Crimea this issue has not 
been discussed at an official level. 
  Replying to a question from UNIAN on the expediency of 
suspending Crimea's economic laws, which were passed by its 
parliament after 19 May, and also on a request to forecast the 
actions of Crimea's parliament after the end of the period of 
elaborating proposals with regard to making the legislation 
conform, Volodymyr Butkevych said that the Crimean MP's confess 
that the laws which they have adopted have not yet been 
implemented. He also stressed that the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine and not the Supreme Council of Crimea would have the 
last word after the end of the agreement period (15 June). 
However, he is convinced that every ground exists for consent to 
be reached between the parliaments. The only thing which could 
be an obstacle is the short time available (two weeks), during 
which proposals should be prepared. But he is convinced that in 
that case, there could be discussion on extending the period. 
  Volodymyr Butkevych said that during the talks, the Crimean 
side expressed the wish to form another commission, with the 
participation of Ukrainian economists Volodymyr Lanovyy and 
Viktor Pynzenyk, which would study economic relations between 
Ukraine and Crimea.

  [Text] Simferopol 7 June TASS -- A final document of the 
Ukrainian parliamentary delegation and the Crimean parliamentary 
working group adopted on 2-3 June in Simferopol has been 
described as a concession to the Ukrainian leadership by some 
Crimean deputies today. They demanded explanations who gave the 
working group the authority to sign the document. 
  Crimean Parliament Speaker Sergey Tsekov said the parliament 
had just forgotten to establish powers of the group at the 
negotiations, and objected to criticism. 
  In his turn, head of the working group Sergey Nikulin called 
the deputies' attention to the fact that every word of the 
document was well-considered and it carries no "wordings that 
impose obligations on any side." 
  The final document was taken into account, and the 
parliament 
decided to set up a new working group to continue the 
negotiations. This time the group's powers will be specified by 
the next parliament plenary scheduled for 14 June.

  [Text] The Crimean Supreme Soviet decided today to set up a 
new working group for further talks with Kiev and to define its 
authority. 
  The parliament's presidium will put forward candidacies for 
participation in the delegation by the next regular meeting 
which will take place in a week (on 17 June). 
  This decision was adopted after most of Crimean deputies had 
withheld their approval of the final document signed by the 
Crimean parliament working group and the Ukrainian Supreme 
Soviet deputy commission signed on 3 June and stating that 
Crimea was a part of Ukraine. 
  The working group on the coordination of Ukrainian and the 
Crimean legislation was established last week in Simferopol in 
order to put forward proposals on coordination of the Ukrainian 
and Crimean constitutions by 15 June. 
  Crimean Chief Negotiator Sergey Nikulin stated that some 
pro-Russian deputies though it was necessary to sign a document 
with more decisive formulas mentioning Crimea as an independent 
republic. 
  However, Nikulin said that the Ukrainian and the Crimean 
delegations had tried to prevent forceful methods of settlement 
of the discord in the legislation. 
  The present conflict between Kiev and Simferopol emerged 
after the Crimean parliament had restored the Crimean 
Constitution in its version of 6 May 1992, providing for a 
treaty basis for relations with Ukraine and for dual citizenship 
for Crimeans.

<F P=106> [Interview with Militia Colonel V. Chernyshev, Ukrainian </F>
deputy minister of internal affairs and chief of the Main 
Administration of Internal Affairs in the Crimea, by Oleg 
Mashchenko; place and date not given: "My Militias Will Keep Me 
Safe?"] 
  [Text] The proverb about too many cooks spoiling the broth 
is well known. We have not reached this number of law 
enforcement organs yet; for now there are just two of them. 
However, a common citizen may easily get a black eye on a dark 
street (or even a well-lit one). 
  Services that are called upon to protect our peace and quiet 
have ended up dragged into the "tug-of-war" between Simferopol 
and Kiev against their will. The position of the Crimean 
authorities with regard to the edicts of L. Kravchuk has been 
repeatedly covered in the mass media organs. 
  We suggest that the readers familiarize themselves with the 
opinion of Militia Colonel V. Chernyshev, Ukrainian deputy 
minister of internal affairs and chief of the Main 
Administration of Internal Affairs in the Crimea. 
  [Mashchenko] Apparently, it would be legitimate to first 
learn some more detailed information about you personally. 
  [Chernyshev] I, for one, am a native of Crimea. I was born 
and grew up here. I am an ethnic Russian. During the 22 years 
that I have served in the internal affairs organs, I have worked 
for 14 years on our native peninsula, in Bakhchisarayskiy and 
Belogorskiy Rayon departments, in various operational and 
command positions, including as chief of the rayon militia. In 
recent years, I have served as deputy chief of the department of 
Administration of Criminal Investigations and as first deputy 
chief of the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs [MVD] Main 
Administration of Criminal Search. 
  [Mashchenko] With a view to filtering out all manner of 
rumors and fantasies associated with the reorganization of the 
MVD of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, I would ask you to 
explain to the readers what the basis for the decisions in 
question was. 
  [Chernyshev] I would like to note right away that not a 
single violation of the legislative acts in effect in both the 
Republic of Crimea and Ukraine was allowed to occur in the 
process of creating the Main Administration of Internal Affairs 
in the Crimea. If we turn to specific documents then, on the 
basis of Article 114-5, Point 7 of the Constitution of Ukraine, 
the president of the state is entitled to establish, reorganize, 
and liquidate ministries, departments, and other organs of state 
executive power in the territory of Ukraine. This is precisely 
why a reorganization, rather than the breakup of the MVD as 
certain politicians paint it; the Main Administration of 
Internal Affairs is a prerogative of the president of Ukraine. 
The edict of L. Kravchuk dated 18 May of this year is an 
absolutely lawful document. 
  The crime situation that has remained extremely tense in the 
Republic of Crimea in recent years was the foundation for this 
step. Everybody is still talking about quite a number of bloody 
crimes committed here with the use of automatic weapons. The 
fact that some subunits, such as the waterway and railway 
militia that performed their official duties directly on the 
territory of the autonomous republic were actually managed from 
Kiev and other cities of Ukraine rather than by the Crimea MVD 
played quite a role in the reorganization of the Crimea MVD. The 
efforts of absolutely all Crimea law enforcement organs will now 
be coordinated by the Crimea Main Administration of Internal 
Affairs. The management of the militia will be in the strictest 
compliance with the letter of the law in view of the fact that 
previously the organs of internal affairs, obeying "pointers 
from on high," on occasion had to perform functions that are not 
characteristic of them. At the same time, the confirmation of 
Reserve Major General V. Kuznetsov in the nonexistent position 
of minister of internal affairs was conducted in gross violation 
of legislative acts currently in effect. According to Article 7 
of the Ukrainian Law on the Militia and Point 8 of the 
Regulations on the Republic of Crimea MVD, such an action must 
mandatorily be coordinated with the Ukrainian minister of 
foreign affairs. 
  [Mashchenko] Valeriy Serafimovich, how can you as a 
professional characterize the actions of Major General V. 
Kuznetsov in the course of leading the internal affairs organs 
on the peninsula? 
  [Chernyshev] Mr. Kuznetsov is certainly a strong-willed, 
decisive person. This is not just my personal opinion but also 
that of the leadership of the Ukrainian MVD. However, we should 
note in particular that top-notch specialists who have an 
excellent knowledge of their jobs have been valued the most at 
all times and in all positions, to say nothing of leadership 
positions. Reserve Major General V. Kuznetsov does not have the 
special training that is necessary even for the rank-and-file 
employees of the internal affairs organs. He is not a lawyer; it 
is hard for him to make the only correct, legitimate decisions 
commensurate with the existing situation without any experience 
in work in the law enforcement organs and without the knowledge 
of legal legislation. This is not his personal fault. 
Undoubtedly, the militia must not be politicized. Incompetence 
brings about, putting it mildly, ill-conceived steps. Let us 
look, say, at the directive of General Kuznetsov dated 21 May on 
arming the personnel of the reorganized ministry and the 
internal affairs organs of the Crimea with automatic weapons and 
issuing bulletproof vests to personnel. Later followed the 
command to capture the unarmed servicemen of the Ukrainian 
National Guard who were on patrol in the vicinity of the TV and 
radio center in Simferopol, provide reinforced guard details for 
the buildings of the Supreme Soviet of the Crimea, banks, 
executive committees, and other important facilities. Unverified 
(?), simply put false information was the basis for making this 
crucial decision. It is easy to guess what the consequences of 
the actions of "Berkut" combatants, armed with assault rifles in 
the downtown of the main city of the Crimea, could have been. 
  Irreparable events did not occur due only to the 
self-control of the militia personnel and servicemen of the 
National Guard of Ukraine. I would like to stress the need to be 
aware of the fact that the control of armed law enforcement 
units that continuously operate among the civilian population 
and accomplish the tasks of protecting public order and 
combating crime differs fundamentally from the rigid nature of 
commanding the troops whose most significant mission is to 
engage in combat. 
  [Mashchenko] As an official, you must trust only the facts. 
Nonetheless, allow me to ask you a question that derives from 
rumors. They are talking about the alleged discontinuation of 
funding for the internal affairs organs of the Republic of 
Crimea, the forthcoming reshuffle of the cadres, and cutbacks in 
positions. What is the actual situation? 
  [Chernyshev] I can state with the full weight of 
responsibility that these are instigative lies. The receipt of 
monetary funds from the Ukrainian MVD has not ceased. The 
account of the Crimea Main Administration of Internal Affairs 
has already been opened; the administration is being funded in 
amounts sufficient for ensuring its regular operations. This 
means that the payment of monetary allowances and other 
allotments to the personnel of the Crimean militia will be made 
in full, just as before. 
  No unsubstantiated replacements of any kind will be made in 
the cadre staff. I will personally prevent any reprisals against 
functionaries fantasies on whose account currently interfere 
with their regular work. 
  The objective of individuals who spread such disinformation 
is as clear as can be: to create an unhealthy, nervous situation 
within the ranks of the internal affairs organs. They are trying 
to set personnel against lawful decisions of the Ukrainian 
president, the Cabinet of Ministers, and the Ukrainian minister 
of internal affairs. A decision on these issues has also been 
made by the Ukrainian Collegium of the MVD. It says 
unambiguously that the staff positions of the reorganized 
Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Crimea will be 
kept in full within the structure of the Crimea Main 
Administration of Internal Affairs. The ranks and volume of 
position pay for our personnel will remain the same. 
  Only the positions of minister and deputy ministers of 
internal affairs are not envisioned on the staff of the Main 
Administration of Internal Affairs in the Crimea. Just as 
before, social protection guarantees envisioned by legislation 
in effect cover all personnel. 
  In summary, I would like to address all personnel of the 
internal affairs organs and residents of the Republic of Crimea, 
taking advantage of the present opportunity. I understand full 
well the complexity of the situation in which you are finding 
yourselves when they are trying to hold the militia hostage to 
someone else's political ambitions and confront it with the 
unnecessary choice of "who to obey?" Everything possible should 
be done in order to prevent the law enforcement organs from 
getting involved in political games; just as before, it is 
necessary for these organs to remain calm and restrained. 
  At present, our main task is to make a deliberate, offensive 
effort to step up the fight against crime, and to uncover and 
put the harshest end to the activities of organized groups of 
malefactors. Our citizens and the guests of the beautiful land 
of the Crimea should be confident of their security, which the 
militia must guarantee for them. I would like to ask my 
comrades-in-arms to remain faithful to your oath and the 
tradition of the internal affairs organs.

<F P=106> [Report by Tetyana Khomych: "Leonid Kuchma: `In Order To </F>
Overpower the Mafia, One Needs To Head It'"] 
  [Text] It is good to get registered as a presidential 
candidate in Chernihiv and forge one's political image in the 
east. This truth was recently once again proved by Leonid 
Kuchma, who paid a short, but rich visit to the Dnieper Region. 
The ex-prime minister and present leader of Ukraine's Union of 
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs and a claimant to the post of 
president of the state launched a decisive attack on the 
consciousness of his former fellow countrymen and associates, 
whose support at the forthcoming presidential elections he is 
seriously counting upon. 
  At the "conference," which was hastily convened by the 
Interregional Block of Reforms [MBR], those present were 
showered with not quite radiant forecasts. In this, the 
people's deputy and one of the MBR leaders may successfully 
compete with yet another fellow-countryman -- Pavlo Hloba [not 
further identified]. It is true, though, that the proponent of 
the strong hand and single power in the state, unlike the 
psychic, does not specialize in collapses in the city 
underground or similar trifles: Leonid Danylovych [Kuchma]'s 
line of business is economic and sociopolitical cataclysms. 
  However, this time, the former head of government and 
presently, according to him, a dissident Ukrainian politician 
("I said at the news conference in the United States -- I am not 
allowed to go anywhere...") failed to amuse the public. Old 
cliches were mainly played back -- that Ukraine on its own will 
not be able to emerge from the crisis, that it must urgently 
decide with whom it is going to side, that, without Russia, 
former USSR republics, or CEMA countries, we will not survive, 
and that as early as in June there will be a social explosion, 
not to mention economic paralysis (therefore, it is pointless to 
postpone the presidential elections), that contradictions 
between western and eastern Ukrainian regions are on the rise, 
and this may lead to unpredictable consequences.... However, a 
number of ideas voiced by him indicated that it is too early to 
brand Kuchma as a steadfast political dogmatist. Since he has 
not been in power and in view of the new realities, his views 
have undergone a gradual evolution. For example, perhaps for 
the first time in his numerous interviews, which have abounded 
in eastern Ukrainian newspapers over recent months, the advocate 
of Ukraine's federal-land structure came out against the 
immediate territorial revolution in Ukraine and explained that 
we can get "26 Crimeas" -- in the opinion of the ex-prime 
minister, federal-land structure is a long-term prospect for the 
state. 
  L. Kuchma also spoke harshly against elections to local 
councils. He argued his position with the circumstance that "due 
to the apparatus games of the leadership of the former Supreme 
Council, we tried to return the Soviet regime, but in a more 
monstrous form." Having destroyed the vertical structure and 
having thereby endowed leaders of regions with powers "similar 
to those of the president" in the sphere of resolving not only 
economic, but also political issues, the state, in the opinion 
of the claimant to the post of its leader, risks much. 
  With all the ardor of the former head of the Cabinet of 
Ministers, L. Kuchma also touched upon prospects of the 
Ukrainian economy. In his firm opinion, most radical reforms 
are imminent there, since "70 percent of everything that we 
manufacture takes the form of assembly parts for CIS countries." 
The general of the defense industry compared Ukraine with a 
huge base for the building up of the Russian military-industrial 
complex and emphasized that Ukraine neither did nor does 
manufacture a single type of weapon in its finite form, and that 
"somebody took good care of that." For many people, the 
following discovery made by Leonid Danylovych, an old-time and 
frank proponent of "a closer union" between Ukraine and Russia, 
came as a surprise. "I am not calling for the return to the 
Soviet Union, because it is impossible. This is because in such 
a situation, even if, tomorrow, we were suddenly to wake up in 
the Union, Moscow will never invest anything in provinces. Nor 
can Ukraine go back to the ruble zone, although such voices do 
sound today among the directorate -- for this is a single policy 
with regard to taxation and a single emission bank. This is 
really a complete loss of statehood...." 
  In short, there were enough political passages to succeed in 
confusing the audience on which was the true Kuchma and which 
the politician, counting on obtaining as many votes as possible 
at the elections and, in practice, constructing a pyramid of 
political autocratic rule in Ukraine. At that point, the 
audience was offered, on the rebound, a model of the following 
type of administration: Leonid Kuchma did not conceal either 
his admiration for the fact that [Yuriy] Andropov [former Soviet 
leader] established order in the country "without a single tank" 
or his disposition to "cruel" [zhorstoki] measures for 
establishing order in the state. "It is not a slip of the 
tongue," pointed out the politician, "not stringent [zhorstki], 
but precisely cruel" and explained that, by this, he implies 
unconditional fulfillment of current laws by everybody without 
exception. 
  The speech and the answers to journalists' questions 
generally attested to the well-considered nature of Kuchma's 
presidency program and also to the fact that the MBR leader is 
seriously counting upon this victory. However, Leonid Kuchma 
did not sound like a candidate for the post from this specific 
alliance, and, in Dnipropetrovsk, he does not stress his close 
affinity to it, thereby giving yet another reason to think that 
great politicians never remain lifelong friends with losers. 
Instead, Kuchma did not persist in denying that his program 
coincides with the program of left-wing forces -- he pointed out 
his readiness, whenever necessary and possible, to cooperate 
with Communists and even with National Radicals, however, it 
looks like this is also up to certain point, because he does not 
recognize coalition governments, or governments of confidence, 
or such things. 
  "I can say that I made the trip to the United States in 
order 
to ask what kind of Ukraine the Americans wanted to see," 
admitted the politician, having stressed yet another time that 
not only was he proceeding to power by the path beaten by the 
Russian president, but that he was also confident of victory in 
the elections. But will Leonid Danylovych have enough 
like-minded supporters?

<F P=106> [Report on a press conference held by Mykola Horyn, chairman </F>
of the Lvov Oblast Council, by Dzhemma Dobrovska: "They Say the 
Chessmen on the Chessboard Have Already Been Arranged"] 
  [Text] On 26 May, thanks to the consolidated effort by 
ultra right and left forces, the Ukrainian Supreme Council 
adopted a resolution rescinding the 23 May decision by the Lvov 
City Council "On Suspension of Commissions for the Elections to 
the Oblast Council." 
  "What the Bolsheviks hoped for so much has actually 
happened," was the comment of Mykola Horyn, chairman of the 
oblast council, at a press conference held yesterday. How will 
the the situation develop? 
  Given the present situation, the oblast council chairman 
said, the 26 June elections will definitely take place 
throughout Ukraine, and in Lvov Oblast in particular. Those 
elections will legally eliminate the presidential structure all 
across Ukraine -- something that the left forces fought for 
since the very first day after the last presidential elections. 
Another important fact produced by the elections, I believe, 
will be the consolidation of the old-style system of soviets in 
Ukraine which is becoming a communist reserve. In an 
unprecedented event in history of democratic development, we 
will have the elections to a government structure that is not 
legally defined or acknowledged by the country's highest 
legislative body. 
  This enables the left majority in the parliament, on the eve 
of the elections, to forge a power system well suited for the 
communist majority in Ukraine. If the present tendencies in 
parliament continue, one can only imagine what is awaiting us 
in the immediate future. 
  A number of questions arise here. Why did the communists 
care so much about legality and virtually unanimously vote to 
cancel our decision? I am also tormented by the question why 
did our "national hero" Stepan Khmara, who shook his fist in 
front of Moroz two days ago, ally himself with those people and, 
on top of it, demand that the Supreme Council resolution include 
a paragraph promising severe punishment for the oblast's 
leadership if it moves to torpedo the 26 June elections? Is it 
possible that none of our deputies wanted to take the rostrum to 
examine this important problem and, as of two days ago, raise a 
question of the communist coup and sovietization now under way 
in our country? 
  The decision by the oblast's council regarding suspension of 
electoral commissions was intended to attract massive puhlic 
attention to the situation in Ukraine. Unfortunately, it failed 
to receive this attention, and the media in Kiev practically 
blocked it for three days. 
  With tacit approval on the part of the group of democratic 
deputies, the Supreme Council managed to adopt this decision. 
This is another victory of the communist majority. 
  I do not understand the position of some political forces in 
Lvov Oblast. I appreciate efforts by the Ukrainian Peasant 
Democratic Party and Ukrainian Republican Party who supported 
the oblast council's decision. I am especially grateful to the 
Lvov Oblast Council which boldly kept its ground and saved its 
moral and political face, living up to expectations of the 
people that elected it four years ago. However, political 
haggling has already started in other political organizations 
staged by specific groups of people and interests. They also 
helped prevent this decision from becoming a political act. I 
am concerned about innuendoes spread by the media to attribute 
specific names to the decision by the oblast's council. Over 
time, everyone will realize what a big mistake we made by not 
transforming this even into a political action. 
  Stepan Davymuk, the Ukrainian president's representative in 
Lvov Oblast, noted: "Many of our politicians thought that 
proimperial and communist forces will resign from politics and 
power. It was naive to think that way. We see those forces 
forming their political organizations and rapidly gaining 
influence over certain levers in the economy and the hinterland. 
  ``We deal here with the restoration of the orthodox 
communist 
force in various options -- as the Socialist, Agrarian Party, 
etc. As a matter of fact, the idea of resuscitating the old 
Soviet Union is being restored. This is the most dangerous 
thing. Ukraine is being driven into a blind alley.'' 
  The journalists asked questions primarily about the recent 
events in the Supreme Council. 
  Mr. Horyn, do you think that this decision, even if 
canceled, 
can still wake up the consciousness of the electorate and 
politicians? [unattributed question] 
  I was expecting that at least the consciousness of our 
Supreme Council deputies would be awakened. I hoped this would 
be used as a serious chance of countering sovietization and 
communization of Ukraine, now under way. Unfortunately, thanks 
to the consolidation of the right and left forces, the decision 
was adopted. This revealed the parochial interests of certain 
political organizations. They say that chessmen have already 
been arranged on the chessborad, and [communists] decided to go 
all the way, no matter what the outcome of this game will be.

  [Text] A two-day operational meeting of Ukrainian military 
officials as well as leaders of other ministries and 
institutions, Cabinet of Ministers, and the military industrial 
complex is underway. Our correspondent Marat Pogorelov reports. 
  [Begin recording] [Pogorelov] This event is characteristic 
for any civilized state. [It is designed] to review the current 
situation in defense, exchange ideas, and work out a long-term 
strategy. Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, supreme 
commander in chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, read a report 
at the meeting. He said: 
  [Kravchuk] Let me stress that this meeting is very important 
for each participant, allowing him to determine his place and 
role in executing decisions regarding heightening combat 
readiness [words indistinct] strengthening the defense 
capability of our state. I think there is no need to prove how 
urgent and important (?this task is). We also need to acquaint 
ourselves [words indistinct] new weapons and military equipment, 
share experiences, and jointly devise relevant methods for 
managing the military. So, as you see, the goal of this meeting 
covers a broad range of issues that have one thing in common: to 
achieve fundamental improvement in and training of command units 
and [words indistinct]. Those who are attending this meeting in 
the first place are those upon whom the training and development 
of the Ukrainian Armed Forces depends. During this meeting, we 
expect active participation and creative approach from all 
participants, because -- and let me repeat this -- in many 
things, we begin [word indistinct] and make our first steps. 
  [Pogorelov] Army General Kostyantyn Radetskyy, Ukrainian 
defense minister, gave a report outlining the concept of 
building up and developing the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The 
operational meeting will end on 8 June at the "Desna" training 
facility in Chernigov Oblast.

  [Text] The Ukrainian Army should stay aloof from politics, 
according to Ukrainian President and Supreme Commander of Armed 
Forces Leonid Kravchuk. "Political feuds should not touch the 
Army," he told a conference of chief executives devoted to army 
issues in Kiev today. 
  "According to the requirements of the times, the armed 
forces 
and the state machinery must be permanently ready to defend 
Ukraine, its sovereignty and territorial integrity," Kravchuk 
said. He pointed out that the Army's main goal was to maintain 
the country's ability to defend itself and maintain the 
inviolability of its borders. 
  The Ukrainian Defense Ministry press service told 
INTERFAX-Ukraine that the conference had been attended by the 
leaders of government, Defense Ministry and the military complex. 
  The conference touched on a wide range of issues embraced by 
the single goal to achieve a qualitative change in the 
management of the Ukrainian armed forces.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 108 (598)] </F>
  [Text] President Leonid Kravchuk opposed the idea of 
forming unions based on ethnic or religious principles in the 
space of the former USSR. Addressing voters in Kharkov Region 
Monday evening, the Ukrainian president criticized the 
Belarusian Premier, Vyacheslav Kebich, for his call for forming 
a union between three Slav countries -- Ukraine, Russia and 
Belarus. 
  In Kravchuk's view, the forming of such alliance will lead 
to 
the emergence of "Asian, Muslim and other unions, to mass 
migrations and to war." 
  In answer to voters' questions the president said that he 
had 
no right to sign the treaty on Ukraine's full membership in the 
economic union of CIS countries, since the parliament had not 
authorized him accordingly. 
  IF Note: At the CIS summit held in Moscow on 15 April 
Kravchuk signed a document on Ukraine's joining the treaty as an 
associated member. He sees no fundamental difference between 
being a full-fledged and an associated member, he told Interfax. 
"The status of associated member does not prevent us from taking 
an active part in the economic union," Kravchuk said. He 
referred to the circumstance that Ukraine's parliament ratified 
the founding documents with reservations. "The reservations are 
still in force, and I cannot ignore them when signing 
documents," Kravchuk pointed out. 
  As Kravchuk said, Ukraine's activity on the world scene must 
not be confined to interaction with the former Soviet republics. 
Next Tuesday in Laxembourg he will sign an agreement on 
partnership and cooperation with the European Union, the 
president told voters. 
  IF Note: So Ukraine will be the first CIS country to sign 
the agreement, which was initialled by its Foreign Minister, 
Anatoliy Zlenko, during his visit to Brussels last February. A 
number of European Union members link their ratification of the 
agreement to Ukraine's joining the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty. The Ukrainian leadership is against such linkage.

  [Text] Kiev -- The visit by President Leonid Kravchuk to 
Kharkov oblast ended on 6 June. There, together with Viktor 
Yushchenko, chairman of the board of Ukraine's National Bank, 
Yuriy Karasyk, Ukraine's minister of agriculture and food, 
Industry Minister Anatoliy Holubchenko, Mykhaylo Kovalko, 
chairman of the state oil and gas committee, and others, he 
familiarized himself with the work of the Zmiyev vegetable 
processing plant and held talks with the president's 
representatives in the oblast rayons, the chairmen of local 
councils, and managers of agricultural enterprises, and also a 
consultation with representatives of Ukraine's gas industry. 
  "The most topical problems needing immediate resolution are 
agrarian issues, issues of foodstuffs, and power, the president 
of Ukraine said. We should support everything that works to 
produce food." As far as the issue of trade with CIS countries 
is concerned, Ukraine, according to Leonid Kravchuk, was the 
first to propose a treaty on free trade between these countries. 
This treaty should envisage equal conditions for the 
participants of a free trade zone. The Ukrainian position 
differs from the position of the Russian side, which insists 
that oil, gas, gold (approximately 100 types of goods), be 
excluded from the free trade zone, that is so that the Russian 
consumer can buy these goods 2.5 times more cheaply than the 
Ukrainian consumer. 
  According to information from Viktor Yushchenko, chairman of 
the board of Ukraine's National Bank, it is now necessary to 
refuse as much as possible an emission solution for rural 
problems [as heard]. It is also necessary to introduce normal 
pricing and a nonemission financial and credit mechanism, to 
improve settlements and currency regulation, change quotas and 
licenses in agriculture, and also to set up support funds for 
the sector by attracting investments. 
  According to Yushchenko, current seasonal inflation is 10-12 
percent compared to the 38 percent each month last year. 
  According to Yuriy Karasyk, Ukraine's minister of 
agriculture 
and food, 10 percent of our state's credit resources will in 
future go on agrarian projects, and a crediting mechanism will 
be elaborated at the expense of the state stabilization fund. 
  Leonid Kravchuk noted at the consultation with 
representatives of Ukraine's gas industry that a program is 
being prepared to develop Ukraine's own energy-carriers, which 
envisages the extraction of 25-30 billion cubic meters of gas 
per year. "We are capable of resolving these problems with our 
personnel and industrial level. All that remains is to find a 
source of finance and equipment, and to make scientific and 
technical plans. In future it may be about attracting foreign 
investments, especially when mastering the Black Sea Basin," the 
president of Ukraine said.

  [Text] President Leonid Kravchuk will be ready to sign the 
agreement on economic union between the CIS countries the day 
after Ukraine's parliament adopts its stipulations to the 
agreement. Addressing the leaders of collective and state farms 
of Kharkov Region on Monday [6 June], Kravchuk said that he had 
no right to sign the agreement, since the parliament had not 
authorized him to do so. 
  At the same time the president criticized Minsk for its call 
for forming a "Slav Union" between Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus. 
The call was made by a candidate for presidential elections in 
Belarus, Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich. 
  According to Kravchuk, the forming of such a union would 
lead 
to the emergence of "Asian, Muslim, and other unions, to a mass 
migration of people, and to war." 
  Kravchuk referred by way of an example to Trans-Dniestria, 
which would inevitably join the proposed Slav Union, while 
Moldova would join Romania.

<F P=106> ["Lvov Region's Agrotechnipark Starts Sort of Free Economic </F>
Zone in West Ukraine" -- UKRINFORM headline; from the "Business 
News Weekly" feature, 30 May - 5 Jun 94] 
  [Text] According to the Post-Postup weekly, on 13 May a 
presentation ceremony took place at the Agrotechnipark 
[ATP]-Brody experimental territorial innovative center, which 
was sponsored by the Lvov Regional State Property Fund, 
Lvov-headquartered Konza R&amp;D association, and the Center for 
R&amp;D 
potential and historical researches under the Ukrainian Academy 
of Sciences. 
  The Agrotechnipark's immediate participants are the local 
Stir, Pravda, Progress agrofirms, dairy, canning and alcohol 
factories, a sewing factory and the Brody forestry. The ATP's 
headquarters on the territory of a missile base, which was 
dismantled in 1993, is owned by Konza. 
  On 25 March, 1994, President Leonid Kravchuk issued an 
instruction involving "a technical-economic experiment" in 
Brody, which served as a legal foundation for setting up the ATP. 
  The ATP project, which extends to the year 2032, encompasses 
a series of economic subprojects, [word indistinct]: 

  -  A serving station for maintenance, repair and upgrading of 
agricultural equipment and machinery. The project involves 
Germany's Hagema, which will supply and service equipment and 
machinery against credits it has been granted. Hagema will be 
entitled to the ATP-Brody's stocks when the latter is converted 
into a joint-stock society; 
  -  The Brody canning factory's 
reconstruction (the project is estimated at $8 
million); 
  -  Optimized forestry in zones of intensive 
agriculture; 
  -  Upgrading of the Brody sewing factory (recently, 
imported equipment worth about $600,000 has been mounted at the 
factory, which has business ties with firms in Germany and 
Finland); 
  -  Application of food irradiation technologies 
($2,631,000). 

  In June the ATP-Brody expects to receive technical aid from 
the US Public Association of agrobusinesses. Similar aid is due 
to come from Canada's Association of agrobusinesses in the fall. 
  According to Yevgeni Pushchik, the Brody district 
presidential emissary, the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development is contemplating to invest about $50 million in the 
ATP-Brody project in 1995. 
  In the meantime, the Joint-Stock Society for the 
Agrotechnipark-Brody project is reported to have been 
established in Philadelphia, Pa. with a view of searching for 
partners and setting up the ATP- Brody's affiliates. 
  Such affiliates are envisaged for setting up in Germany, 
Hungary, Russia, China, Slovakia, and Czechia. In particular, 
Czechia's FDH and Slovakia's Milispol, whose representatives 
attended the presentation ceremony, are reported to have 
intimated their willingness to be involved in the ATP-Brody 
project. 
  A governmental decree is expected to be shortly issued, 
which 
will specify the ATP-Brody project's implementation terms and 
mechanisms to make the territorial innovative center functioning.

  [Text] The Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada (parliament) passed a 
law, which amended the Cabinet's decree on foreign investment 
procedures. The law changed Articles 3 and 4, which had provided 
for foreign investors' right to effect investment in Ukraine in 
the form of any movable or immovable property including land 
(Article 3), and their right to all types of investments, which 
involve six forms including the form of acquisition, not 
directly prohibited by Ukraine's legislation, of any movables 
and immovables including land plots (Article 4). The new law 
nullifies investors' right to land. 
  Besides, Article 42 on proprietorial rights to land and 
other 
natural resources now specifies that "obtaining by foreign 
investors of proprietorial rights to natural resources is 
regulated by Ukraine's legislation." The Cabinet's decree 
provided for more specific regulation of such rights, in 
particular, by the Land Code of Ukraine. 
  The Cabinet's decree was approved on 20 May 1993 (No. 55-93) 
and was based on the laws on foreign economic activities and on 
investment activities in Ukraine. 
  The law on making amendments to the Cabinet's decree on 
foreign investment procedures was signed by President Kravchuk 
on 2 February 1994. However, its text became available to the 
media only on 4 June 1994.

  [Text] Kiev -- As a UNIAN correspondent learned from 
confidential sources on 7 June, a special budgetary commission 
has been created in Ukraine's Cabinet of Ministers, which 
includes ministers and deputy ministers of the economy, 
statistics, and finance, and also the chairman of the board of 
the National Bank of Ukraine. Acting Prime Minister Yukhym 
Zvyahilskyy will confirm a draft of the commission's work. 
  The commission is to examine the deficit of the new budget 
until the end of the year (this budget is now being elaborated 
by the Ministry of Finance), discuss the possibility of reducing 
the expenditure part of the budget, and to submit proposals on 
reducing the budget deficit in accordance with IMF demands, 
which are also being adjusted. 
  As Viktor Yushchenko, the chairman of the National Bank of 
Ukraine said, as of today, the Ministry of Finance's debt to the 
state is 50 trillion karbovantsi and if the Ministry of 
Finance's debts are not confirmed in the new budget there could 
be an inflationary explosion in Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ukraine's Industry Minister Anatoliy </F>
Holubchenko by Lyudmyla Nikolaychuk; place and date not given: 
"Unless We Create an Industrial-Banking Union, the Banks Will 
Begin To Die Following the Industry"] 
  [Text] [Nikolaychuk] Anatoliy Kostyantynovych, what, in 
your opinion, must be the most urgent measures taken by the 
parliament? 
  [Holubchenko] Undoubtedly, the most important thing today is 
"to stir up production." A whole range of measures must be 
adopted, which would allow producers to work normally, would 
stimulate rather than choke them with taxes, and would defend 
them against the highhandedness of bureaucrats, corruption, and 
crime. 
  It is necessary to resolve the issue of working capital as 
well as the indexation of people's banking accounts. The issue 
of social protection of pensioners is also very acute, since, no 
matter how surprising it seems to be, pensioners and elderly 
people, who apparently have already done their job, are the most 
politically active sector of society, which, in particular, was 
confirmed by the elections. If normal living conditions were 
created for them, they would become less politicized, and their 
place would be filled by more reformist-minded people with the 
advanced views. People, who currently live as our elderly 
citizens do, cannot rest. What kind of rest can there be in 
poverty? To create conditions for a normal life of pensioners, 
which would allow us to conduct reforms, is also one of 
parliament's tasks. 
  Relations between bankers and industrialists are another 
very 
serious, and probably even a key problem. Industrialists are 
currently blaming bankers for all sins, and the latter are 
blaming industrialists. None of them, however, has ever sat at 
a negotiating table and discussed how to overcome the crisis. I 
believe that a union of bankers and industrialists holds the 
link, with the help of which one can pull out the whole chain. 
Bankers must understand that they will live better only if they 
are able to financially ensure normal work of industry. 
Industrialists will then see bankers as not their enemies and 
oppressors, but as friends and fellow champions. Clearing of 
payments will then not take three months, and banks will not use 
this money for credits, but they will want to quickly deliver 
payments to customers. One must help these two groups reach an 
understanding, and I believe that the parliament, the National 
Bank, the Cabinet of Ministers, and perhaps new nonstate 
industrial-banking unions can play a certain role in this. 
  [Nikolaychuk] As far as I know, you have been one of the 
first people in Ukraine to suggest that the main reason behind 
the crisis is the conflict between industrialists and bankers, 
and that their union will be beneficial for the state. You have 
built a whole concept around this issue. What is the main point? 
  [Holubchenko] Banks' profits have currently exceeded those 
of industrial enterprises by three or four times. Additionally, 
enterprises are being stopped and closed. But where are the 
banks' profits? Where have they been directed, where are they 
working, and where have they been invested? 
  Currently, our large industrial enterprises do not trust 
small commercial banks -- they go only to large ones. But when 
they need credits they ask small commercial banks, because they 
cannot obtain them from large ones.... Banks must also 
understand that when a customer comes to them and deposits money 
or collateral, they must make all possible efforts to deliver 
the money to the addressee within two or three days. A customer 
who has money in an account must have the confidence that, no 
matter what happens, when he orders a bank to transfer money, it 
will be done. A bank must work in a way to ensure that it 
always have these funds, and that a customer can receive a 
credit on working capital whenever he wants. This is what 
industrialists currently need. This is not someone's whim, but 
a current demand. A bank must also be interested in investing 
money in industry. 
  Of course, a bank must have the confidence that a customer 
will not leave it, that he will pay the interest rate for a 
credit received in time (since credit resources are essential), 
and that it will receive a part of profits for investing its 
capital in enterprises. This is an entire system that should 
have the form of an agreement between a bank and an 
industrialist. 
  For over a year and a half in my work in government, every 
day I have been hearing from industrialists how bad bankers are, 
and from bankers -- about bad industrialists. This is not 
normal. Yet, they all do the same thing. I believe that when 
bankers understand that their prosperity depends on industry's 
wellbeing, things will be put in order in our country. 
  [Nikolaychuk] Yet, one can also understand bankers: Given 
the current level of inflation, long-term credits are 
unprofitable, and profits are produced only by short-term 
credits, which, at best, can be used for purchasing ready-made 
goods for resale, not for developing, or all the more, for 
launching new production. 
  [Holubchenko] The point is that banks must give up huge 
profits. They must live very modestly, in order to not let 
industry die, and to help it overcome the crisis. If industry 
stops, banks will have no place to obtain money, and nobody will 
support them. Banks will begin to die following industry, 
whether we want this or not. Our government must be wise enough 
to conciliate the two forces and to convince them to work for 
each other. It must create conditions for friendly work of 
these two groups, so the search for guilty stops, and productive 
work begins. This, of course, requires an appropriate training 
of cadres, qualifications, skills, and talent. At least, I 
would like to see such a new government -- not a fiscal one, but 
creating normal relations and conditions for harmonious work. 
  [Nikolaychuk] Based on your theory, however, the government 
will have to force banks to accept small profits, even if this 
method of "carrot and stick" comprises much more of the second 
component.... 
  [Holubchenko] One must not force them! I am convinced that 
if bankers sit at "a round table" with industrialists and become 
aware of the state of affairs in industry, one will not have to 
force them -- they themselves will agree to establish such a 
union. 
  [Nikolaychuk] Who, in your opinion, can play the leading 
role on both sides? 
  [Holubchenko] These can be, for example, the Association of 
Commercial Banks and the Ukrainian Union of Entrepreneurs and 
Industrialists, led, of course, by the government. 
  [Nikolaychuk] Provided that your theory is implemented, when 
can we expect positive results? 
  [Holubchenko] The point is that we do not have time for 
long- term things and distant forecasts. Circumstances and the 
crisis are advancing so rapidly, that we have, perhaps, a few 
months to resolve such essential issues as, first of all, the 
problem of working capital and the payment crisis, which would 
allow the industry to rebound. By the way, a union of bankers 
and industrialists can become one of the primary measures aimed 
at overcoming the payment crisis. The payment crisis is a drag 
on the path to move forward -- on political resolution to all 
kinds of relations in Ukraine, on friendship among all parties, 
on parliament's work, and the people's mood. It does not let us 
breathe, it does not let us work, and it does not let us look to 
the future. If one cannot see any perspective, one cannot move 
forward.

  [Text] According to the Ukrainian Labor Ministry, 
Ukrainian employment centers registered 236,800 jobless persons 
in the first quarter of 1994. 123,400 of these were registered 
back in 1993. 
  However, hidden unemployment increased at industrial 
enterprises, particularly those under the Ministry of 
engineering, MIC [Military Industrial Complex] and conversion. 
  As tentative estimates by the Labor Ministry suggest, about 
2,200,000 workers were on unpaid leaves in the first quarter, or 
14.2 per cent of the total number of workforce. March's 
official unemployment rate was stated at 0.35 per cent. 
  However, as independent experts' data, which were made 
public 
at the International Conference on Economics in Kiev in late 
May, suggest, Ukraine's hidden unemployment minimal rate is in 
excess of 7 million workers. Meanwhile, some 120,000 jobs 
remain vacant. 
  The State's employment bodies and local authorities are 
reported as intending to step up implementation of the national 
and territorial employment programs, which involve, in 
particular, creation of new jobs at enterprises of all 
proprietorial forms. However, no one can tell how many of these 
or how soon they will be created, except 279,100 jobs reserved 
for citizens certified as unable to compete on par with others 
on Ukraine's labor market.

<F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature, 30 May-5 Jun 94] </F>
  [Text] Currently, domestic oil and gas are basically 
extracted in Ukraine's two large regions, one in East Ukraine 
(62 and 77 per cent of the total figures, respectively) and the 
other in West Ukraine (36 and 22 per cent), respectively, of 
Ukraine's total domestic oil and gas extraction). 
  As experts maintain, to comprehensively survey and prospect 
Ukraine's oil and gas promising regions (the Dnieper-Donetsk 
caldera, Transcarpathian arch, shelves of the Black Sea and the 
Sea of Azov), at least three to four seismic stations, three 
specialized stations with 10 vibration generators and other 
sophisticated equipment will be necessary to lay out the fields 
and pinpoint their deposits of carbohydrates. These will help to 
increase the discovery coefficient from its present 0.3 to 0.5 
value, which means that five in every 10 surveyed structures 
must be carbohydrate-bearing. 
  As B. Gotski, superintendent of the agency for oil and gas 
resources of the State Committee for oil and gas, disclosed to 
UKRINFORM, the State Committee is considering application of 
comprehensive extraction technologies (including the cycling 
process) involving 10 newly developed fields and exploited 
fields in Ukraine. 
  Besides additional expenditures, this will require 
application of the so-called 3D seismic equipment, which is not 
available in Ukraine. Hard currency shortages do not allow the 
State Committee for oil and gas and State Committee for geology 
to finance purchases of such equipment units, though prices for 
them are not too exorbitant and range from 25 to 35 million 
dollars apiece. According to B. Gotski, the Volyn-Podol lowland 
region is virtually unprospected, though it may contain 
carbohydrate deposits, too. 
  Presently, about 127.8 million tons (or 83.5 per cent) of 
prospected liquid carbohydrate deposits are exploited, according 
to the State Committee for oil and gas. The remainder is either 
surveyed or has been conserved. About 87.8 million tons of 
liquid carbohydrate deposits (or 57 per cent of the total 
amount) belong to the category of hard to extract ones. 
  In accordance with the National Program for oil and gas 
extraction in Ukraine, which extends to the year 2010, primary 
emphasis will be placed on development and exploitation of the 
Black Sea and the Sea of Azov shelves, which have been surveyed 
by meager 3 per cent by now. So, domestic and foreign capital 
investments for survey, prospecting, offshore deep drilling will 
focus on precisely this promising shelf region.

<F P=106> [By Tatyana Khudobina, Vesti presenter] </F>
  [Text] We have received an urgent report from the Russian 
Federation Foreign Ministry which says U.S. Ambassador Thomas 
Pickering was invited to the Russian Foreign Ministry, where 
[Anatoliy] Adamishin, first deputy foreign minister, told him 
the following: 
  On 7 June at 1328 hours Moscow time [0928 GMT], Air Defense 
Troops spotted a plane 150 km south-west of the town of Adler. 
The plane failed to respond to the relevant Russian services. 
  The Air Defense Troops informed the plane's crew that 
overflight of Russian territory was forbidden. However, 
ignoring the ban, the plane continued on its course and entered 
80 km into Russian airspace. 
  At 1410 the plane, accompanied by the Air Defense Troops' 
fighter planes, was forced to land at the airport in Adler. It 
was established that the plane belongs to the United States, 
flying the Frankfurt-am-Main - Tbilisi route. No flight plans 
involving overflight of Russian territory were filed. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry expects the American side to 
adopt disciplinary measures concerning those guilty of the 
incident, so as to prevent similar dangerous incidents from 
occuring in the future. The U.S. Ambassador promised to inform 
the United States leadership immediately of the Russian 
statement. He expressed gratitude for the fact that in this 
extraordinary situation the Russian authorities showed tact and 
understanding and that, once the situation was cleared, the 
plane was allowed to continue on its way to Tbilisi.

  [Text] Sochi June 8 TASS -- The severance of ties and 
communication between the republics of the former Soviet Union 
caused Tuesday's incident involving an American plane, according 
to a duty officer of Sochi's airport. 
  The plane en route to Tbilisi and Baku to deliver supplies 
for American diplomats in Georgia and Azerbaijan violated 
Russia's airspace and was landed at Sochi's Adler airport at 
14:37 on Tuesday. Three hours later, at 17:46, when the 
incident was settled the plane continued the flight. 
  "Before we had direct telephone lines with all nearest 
district centres and such an incident could have been settled 
much faster," Vyacheslav Isayev, duty officer of Sochi's 
airport, said. 
  "There are no flights from Adler to Sukhumi (capital of 
Abkhazia) -- neither civil nor military. There is no 
communication. It is extremely hard to work in such 
conditions," he said.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Payson report in the "Armaments" column: "Russia's </F>
Missile Technology Passes Under International Control. The 
Russian Federation Government Is Leaning Toward This Decision"] 
  [Text] Among the many peculiar things shaping the 
present-day picture of missile technology proliferation are a 
number of international protocols and memoranda which apparently 
have no legal force but which nonetheless are actively being 
used to bring pressure to bear on those "falling" out of this 
picture. It would seem a good cause to restrain the 
proliferation of missile nuclear technology, limit the number of 
states possessing means of mass annihilation, keep the so-called 
"threshold" states at the threshold.... Yet not infrequently 
proliferation control, with respect to its initiators -- 
primarily the developed Western countries and the United States 
-- becomes a kind of tool to maintain the competitiveness of 
their domestic high technology companies and limit infiltration 
of Russian and other firms into capacious arms/space markets. 
  At the Russian-U.S. Information Center in Moscow journalists 
met with participants in a session of the Missile Technology 
Control Regime (MTCR) Expert Group: B. Dluzhnetskiy, A. 
Pikayev, G. Pike, W. Potter, and Chen Yong-pin. 
  The missile technology proliferation control regime was 
established in 1987 by seven leading Western powers with the 
dominant role belonging to the United States. It primarily 
concerned limiting the export from developed countries of 
various know-how which could be used to create combat missiles 
and, naturally, also noncombat rockets, because it is quite an 
uphill task telling one from the other. 
  The MTCR was also tested on Russian rocket producers. In 
October 1993 Russia and the United States signed a bilateral 
memorandum on observing the basic control regime principles, and 
its results were not slow in coming. The contract between the 
Indian Space Research Organization and the Main Space 
Administration for the delivery of cryogenic missile boosters 
was in the end "revised" under U.S. pressure; true, the United 
States will partially compensate Russia for corresponding 
losses, but the damage to Russian-Indian relations and the 
commercial reputation of Russian firms has already been done. 
Moreover, the Salyut scientific and production association has 
been left without a lucrative order. At present the Russian 
Government, as mentioned earlier, is closely examining the 
question of full accession to the control regime. 
  Still, it is believed that the MTCR "pluses" for this 
country 
outweigh its obvious "minuses." On one hand, who knows where -- 
God forbid -- missiles sold in violation of the regime to more 
or less aggressive states will fly? Considering the "half-life" 
of the former Union's single air border control system, the 
consequences could prove catastrophic. Furthermore, it is 
thought that the signatories to MTCR agreements, having thus 
recorded their commitment to the regime's ideas, can enjoy 
certain export privileges and breaks -- "in the working 
process".... 
  "We are against," it was stated at the press conference, 
"the 
control regime's being used by certain states to obtain 
commercial advantages." In place of sanctions, expert group 
participants propose cooperation: primarily in creating an 
international orbital station (it is another matter that Alfa is 
not a panacea, and that the engine makers themselves will hardly 
find a worthy place in this international program). Meanwhile 
the U.S. AEROSPACE DAILY from time to time publishes selections 
of commercial propositions opening with such "teasers" as: "A 
Russian space scientific and research organization with 
extensive experience of work during the days of the Cold War 
offers...." -- and offers you name it. What about a strict 
technology control regime? Oh, come on! As long as 
achievements by scientists and designers remain unclaimed in 
their own country, no control regime will be able to stop 
"cooperation on the threshold." Except, perhaps, the personal 
responsibility and good will of the missile workers who 
understand what can and what cannot be offered to the new 
"tigers" and "dragons" seeking to supplement their economic 
accomplishments with missile-nuclear and space "toys."

<F P=106> [Report by Arkadiy Zheludkov: "Weekend Explosions in </F>
Central Moscow"] 
  [Text] Explosions are becoming increasingly common in the 
capital, which will not please Moscow Criminal Investigation 
Department No. 6, which investigates these crimes. The two 
latest "firework displays" took place in central Moscow, not far 
from IZVESTIYA. 
  Both explosions occurred at night, which, according to the 
experts, rules out the possibility of an attempted killing. 
More than likely, specialists from the Main Internal Affairs 
Administration say, they were warnings or attempts to 
intimidate. At the Main Internal Affairs Administration press 
center information was extremely thin on the ground, as ever: 
The first explosion took place in the early hours of Saturday 
in the branch of the "Stolichnyy" bank that is being constructed 
at 22/2 Chekhov Street: An explosive device of an unknown type 
went off at 0245 hours. Three windows were shattered, but there 
no casualties. 
  At 0125 hours on the next night, not far away, near 30/2 
Tverskaya Street, a Mercedes 230 car exploded. The bomb, of an 
unknown type, probably homemade, exploded under the rear right 
wheel of the Mercedes and the car was turned over by the blast 
onto the car next to it. The privately registered 6-series 
Zhiguli was burned out as a result. All that is known about the 
owner of the Mercedes is that he is 30, he does not work 
anywhere, and he lives on Bolotnikovskaya Street in Moscow. 
  According to established practice, there will be a long 
search for the bombers, with special crime investigation centers 
being set up at the Moscow militia's 108th and 64th stations. 
For the time being, Muscovites living in the center can only 
pray at night or go to their dachas for the weekend.

  [Text] St. Petersburg June 8 TASS -- "Peace is still too 
fragile and demands for the maximum results in the settlement of 
the six-year armed conflict are hardly acceptable," Russian 
Ambassador at Large Vladimir Kazimirov, who has been acting as 
the Russian president's special envoy to Karabakh, said at the 
session of the CIS inter-parliamentary assembly. He was 
speaking in the discussion of the Commonwealth's peace-keeping 
missions. 
  Kazimirov spoke after chairman of Kyrgyzstan's parliament 
Medetkan Sherimkulov reported on the work done by the CIS 
interparliamentary group led by him to promote the peaceful 
settlement in Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  Sherimkulov said in his report that since a cease-fire 
protocol was signed in Bishkek, the warring parties have 
observed its provisions in the zone of the Armenian-Azeri 
conflict in the past four weeks.

  [Text] St. Petersburg June 8 TASS -- In line with a 
decision taken on Wednesday by the council of the CIS 
interparliementary assembly, the CIS private law research and 
consulting centre will begin to elaborate a model civil code of 
CIS countries. 
  This is expected to lay groundwork to bring the national 
civil legislations of the CIS countries closer together on such 
key economic integration-related matters as the legal status of 
commercial organisations, freedom of goods traffic and 
transactions, the proteciton of foreign investors' interests, 
the development of legislation on contracts and guarantees of 
the discharge of obligations, and the establishment of a similar 
procedure to resolve economic disputes. 
  A model civil code is to be referred for adoption to the CIS 
interparliamentary assembly session in October.

  [Text] St. Petersburg June 8 TASS -- Vladimir Shumeyko, 
chairman of the council of the CIS interparliamentary assembly, 
and Admiral Aleksandr Mochaikin, representative from the 
headquarters for coordinating CIS military cooperation, 
recommended the participants of the session of the 
interparliamentary assembly's council, currently under way in 
St. Petersburg, to set up CIS peace- keeping forces. 
  Interviewed by ITAR-TASS, the admiral stressed the urgent 
need to set up such units. There are only Russian disengagement 
forces were on the territory of the CIS at present, but their 
status does not correspond to the U.N. mandate on peace-keeping 
forces. According to Mochaikin's forecast, not all the CIS 
nations will be ready to assign their troops for peacekeeping 
missions, but their contribution, he believes, could be 
financial or in the form of equipment deliveries. 
  In case today's appeal to the MPs to set up CIS 
peace-keeping 
forces is met, the question will have to be discussed at the 
level of the CIS council of defence ministers and council of 
foreign ministers so that corresponding proposals could be 
submitted to the next plenary meeting of the interparliamentary 
assembly.

  [Text] St. Petersburg June 8 TASS -- The council of the 
interparliamentary assembly has adopted a resolution today on 
the importance of providing legal and social guarantees to 
international servicemen and their families. 
  The resolution was adopted on the initiative of the Ingush 
president and chairman of the committee for affairs of 
international servicemen under the council of heads of CIS 
states, Ruslan Aushev. 
  "The resolution, which affects the fate of over 700,000 
people, was adopted by the council of the interparliamentary 
assembly practically without demur," said Vladimir Shumeyko in 
an interview with ITAR-TASS. He pointed out that the settlement 
of problems connected with legal and social aid to servicemen 
involved in wars and military operations in foreign countries 
encounter difficulties in the CIS. He came out for the 
improvement of the system of the realization of interstate legal 
acts of aid to veterans, adopted in the framework of the CIS, 
including control over their implementation by top legislative 
bodies of sovereign states. 
  Shumeyko expressed the hope that programmes, coordinated 
between countries of the CIS and connected with the welfare and 
health care of war veterans, will be given budgetary support.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 9 TASS--ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI carries an 
article about Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev's current 
three-day visit to Transcaucasian republics. The visit began on 
Wednesday. The article is headlined "Will Russian Peacekeepers 
Be Brought to Abkhazia?". 
  "Fifteen hundred Russian peacekeepers are supposed to be 
brought to the area of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict. 
Peacekeeping units from other CIS countries are to be brought 
to the region at subsequent stages of the operation to settle 
the situation there. 
  "Final decisionmaking is within the competence of the 
Russian 
president who chairs the council of the heads of state of CIS 
countries." 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA runs an article contributed by Russian 
Defence Minister Pavel Grachev under the headline "The Military 
Doctrine and Security of Russia". 
  Grachev explains the essence of the most important 
provisions 
of the military doctrine and peculiarities of the contemporary 
military-political and geostrategic position of Russia, 
determining basic approaches to ensuring her national security. 
  Touching upon nuclear weapons, Grachev pointed out as 
follows: "One of the paradoxes of the nuclear age is the fact 
that nuclear weapons while piling up in the arsenals of 
adversaries during the Cold War, assumed a new form of their 
existence as a political deterrent to a large-scale war". 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (Red Star) carries an article about the 
Russian Defence Ministry's special control service which 
monitored foreign nuclear tests. 
  "The main method to detect underground nuclear explosions is 
a seismic one. Over a span of 35 years, the ministry's 
monitoring service recorded more than 600 various nuclear 
detonations at foreign test sites. They were conducted by the 
United States, France, China, Britain, and India. 
  "After the Cold War ended, nuke test monitoring problems did 
not diminish. Countries began to conduct only underground 
nuclear detonations of low and very low yield. There also 
emerged countries which are potential possessors of nuclear 
weapons". 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA reports, referring to informed sources 
in the Russian Government, that "the question of Viktor 
Chernomyrdin's resignation from the premiership on health 
grounds and the appointment of Yuriy Skokov has been decided in 
principle in President Boris Yeltsin's entourage". 
  The newspaper's opinion is that Skokov's expected 
appointment 
is prompted by the fact that "the Russian parliament ceases to 
be controlled by the president. Therefore, most likely, Skokov, 
in exchange for his appointment to the premiership, promised 
Yeltsin to ensure the pilotage of the president-drafted bills 
through the State Duma". 
  TRUD runs an open letter by researchers from the Russian 
Academy of Medical Sciences to Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin. The researchers urge him "to keep the established 
procedure for financing the academy as a separate item in the 
federal budget". 
  Researchers point out that "research funding has ceased. 
Funds assigned for the payment of salaries to the research 
staff and attending personnel in April-May 1994 accounted for 65 
percent of the necessary amount. Russian medico-biological 
science, which once won world recognition, may be ruined and its 
restoration would take decades". 
  PRAVDA carries an interview with Olzhas Suleymenov, a 
prominent Kazakh poet and member of the republican parliament. 
  Touching upon the idea of establishing a Euro-Asian 
confederation, Suleymenov expressed the conviction that "a 
confederation or a union of independent states of Eurasia is a 
historical inevitability. The Commonwealth of Independent 
States is the threshold of such an entity". 
  The newspaper SEGODNYA (Today) comments on the incident 
involving the U.S. C-130 cargo plane which was forced to land at 
Adler by Russian jetfighters while on a flight from Frankfurt on 
Main to Tbilisi. 
  The paper points out that "in view of the break-up of the 
Soviet air defence system, Russia has to set up new air defence 
district boundaries, in the Caucasus in particular, which served 
as the subject of study by U.S. and NATO radio reconnaissance 
centres in Turkey. The presence of reconnaissance equipment on 
board the C-130 is not ruled out. According to onboard 
documents, the plane carried a diplomatic cargo, an inspection 
of which was scarcely probable".

  [Text] According to People's Deputy Syarhey Navumchyk, who 
is also the coordinator of the Belarusian Popular Front 
parliamentary opposition, Henadz Karpenka, a former contender 
for the presidential post, has agreed to join Zyanon Paznyak's 
presidential team. It is not ruled out, Navumchyk stated, that 
in the event of Paznyak's victory in the presidential elections 
Henadz Karpenka will be appointed prime minister. 
  The joining of Paznyak's team by this politician, in 
Navumchyk's opinion, is helpful in three ways: First, such a 
political personality would do credit to any democratic 
organization; this will also be helpful to the state in general. 
Second, this is an important step in unifying democratic forces 
in Belarus. Finally, Karpenka has good connections in Russia's 
political circles, which is also of great importance.

  [Text] What will the first presidential edict be? We can 
provide an answer to a certain degree because the candidates for 
president of Belarus -- as their public statements show -- have 
already specified their positions on the issue. When Vyachaslaw 
Kebich met with workers of the Minsk Margarine Factory, he 
stated that the first document to be signed by him in the 
highest post of the Republic will be an edict concerning 
combating crime. Alyaksandr Lukashenka intends to begin his 
office with a similar decision. According to Syarhey Navumchyk, 
campaign manager of Zyanon Paznyak, the first edict of the 
Belarusian Popular Front leader -- should he be elected 
president -- will sack ministers who are in charge of mass media 
in the Republic. As to Alyaksandr Dubko and Stanislaw 
Shushkevich, they wish to begin their careers with resolving 
economic issues. As it was declared at the first news 
conference by communist leader Vasyl Novikaw, his first edict 
will annul the presidential post in Belarus.

(?Krichev) Rayon -- of the 40th Russian Air Force Group has 
caused big problems for the local administration. To use this 
territory in the interests of the rayon, mine clearing, and land 
improvement should be carried out, and the housing of the small 
garrison should be repaired. The rayon executive committee 
addressed the command staff of this unit and the Belarusian 
Defense Ministry asking for help. However, foreign servicemen 
refuse to perform this work. Therefore, the rayon executive 
committee addressed the Mogilev Oblast Executive Committee to 
plead with the Belarusian Government to resolve this issue on an 
intergovernmental level.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 7/6/1994 -- "Moldovan 
leadership's decision not to insist on the 14th Army's 
withdrawal in the summer of 1994 during the ninth round of 
negotiations is without doubt a positive fact," told BASA 
Stanislav Khazheyev, defense minister of the self-proclaimed 
Dniester Republic. General Khazheyev mentioned that it is unreal 
for the withdrawal to take place by 1 July 1994. He said that 
several years are needed for the 14th Army's withdrawal. He 
also pointed out that Dniester representatives who take part in 
the negotiations will have the possibility to make public their 
position on this matter. Khazheyev said that he is confused 
that the Dniester representatives took part in the negotiations 
only as observers. "The Dniester Republic should take part in 
the talks with full rights," he said. Khazheyev pointed out 
that the Tiraspol Supreme Soviet's decision to pass the 14th 
Army's property to Dniester will not be annulled.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 7/6/1994 -- "The visit of the 
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel to the districts densely 
inhabited by Gagauzians to learn about the economic, social, and 
political problems of the south of the republic will not affect 
the relations of cooperation and friendship between the Gagauz 
republic and the Moldovan Dniester republic established 
according a bilateral agreement," stated Stepan Topal, president 
of the self-proclaimed Gagauz republic, at a press conference 
held last evening in Comrat. "Though the political situation of 
Gagauzia and Dniester differ, we will maintain the relations 
with this region and with all countries that support us. While 
the major states promote a large policy, we, Gagauzians, accept 
the foreign support and have the chance to develop strongly in 
the next 5-10 years. To prosper, Gagauzians need a 
sociopolitical stability in the region, which we hope will be 
achieved in the near future with the adoption by the Moldovan 
Parliament of the spectral juridical status." Referring to the 
$35 million credit offered by Turkey to Moldova, Topal said that 
there already exist concrete projects for its utilization. It 
is stipulated that $32 million will be allocated for water 
supply to the southern districts of Moldova, and the remaining 
$3 million for the creation of the respective infrastructure. 
Referring to Suleyman Demirel's opinion on the Gagauz problem, 
Stepan Topal stated that: "The President of Turkey has 
emphasized that this is a Moldovan internal affair. Suleyman 
Demirel is satisfied with the fact that his visit to Moldova 
laid the foundation to the settlement of this problem." 
According to Topal, Comrat is absolutely sure of the fact that 
"Turkey considers Gagauzia a means of penetrating the markets of 
Moldova, the Ukraine and Russia."

  [Text] Comrat, BASAPRESS, 6/6/1994 -- The Gagauz Supreme 
Soviet Presidium decided to summon on 9 June an ordinary session 
of the Gagauz Parliament. Vasili Neikovchin [name as received], 
spokesman of the Gagauz Parliamentary Presidium, stated to BASA 
that the deputies will examine the final variant of the 
"Gagauz-Eri-Gagauzia" project of special juridical status for 
Gagauzians. After the project is finalized it will be presented 
to the Moldovan Parliament. Peru Buzaji, chairman of the Gagauz 
Parliamentary Commission for settling the problem of juridical 
status, stated to BASA: "During the last four months of 
negotiations with the similar Moldovan Parliamentary Commission 
led by Ion Ungureanu and meetings between Moldovan and Gagauz 
officials, practically, a convenient compromise has been 
reached. This time it seems that the Moldovan Parliament has no 
reason not to adopt this project as a fundamental law for Gagauz 
people's autonomy." He pointed out that it is very important 
"that the future Moldovan Constitution will have an article 
recognizing the Gagauz people's existence." Buzaji also 
specified that there were disagreements between the Chisinau and 
Comrat leaders on the first two articles, Articles 12, 25, etc. 
Article 22, for example, states that Moldova will be responsible 
of security and defense in the region. Buzaji said that the 
Gagauz side insisted that the soldiers of the districts densely 
inhabited by Gagauzians be not involved in combat operations 
without the Gagauz Parliament's consent and the written consent 
of each soldier. "We made many compromises but we are not going 
to give in any more, because Gagauz people will not admit and 
not forgive this," said Buzaji. "We hope that the current 
Moldovan leadership is aware of the realities and that it will 
be the parliament's decision to offer Gagauzians the historical 
chance to self-determination, national rebirth and their 
development as a nation."

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 7/6/1994 -- "After Turkish 
President Suleyman Demirel's visit to Moldova, the draft law on 
spectral juridical status for the districts densely inhabited by 
Gagauzians has not been changed," stated to BASA Victor 
Greben-scicov, presidential counselor. According to him, the 
Turkish president gave no directives to the Comrat leaders in 
this regard. "The Comrat leaders had previously received several 
foreign delegations at a quite high level which, in my opinion, 
were useful for all sides," added Grebenscicov. He noted that 
the Turkish president insisted on preservation of Moldova's 
integrity. "I do not share the opinion of those who say that 
the law on status for the districts densely inhabited by 
Gagauzians would lead to Moldova's federalization," specified 
Grebenscicov. He pointed out that the draft law supposes 
decentralization. "This implies a broad autonomy and not a 
republic," he said.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 7/6/1994 -- "Though they follow 
different objectives, Suleyman Demirel [president of Turkey] and 
Mircea Snegur realized that they can attain them at the same 
chess table," states the newspaper of the Moldovan Christian 
Democratic People's Front (FPCD) TARA (THE COUNTRY). "The 
Chisinau authorities, which work hard to ruin our national 
prospect on this territory, would like someone to pay for their 
debts. They take advantage of Turkey's interests in this 
segment of the East European political space. At the same time, 
Turkey's intentions to use in its interests the situation, which 
was created by the process of creating the second Romanian 
state, are more than obvious. Turkey at last will set a strong 
control over this area." The strongest move the Turkish 
president has made in this political chess game is the use of 
the Gagauz problem, says the newspaper, adding that Suleyman 
Demirel considers Gagauzians "the representatives of a distinct 
branch of Turkish peoples," which "were the first to settle on 
this land." Thus, declaring that "Gagauzians will respect the 
territorial integrity of Moldova and welcoming the elaboration 
of the special juridical status for the southern Moldova, 
Suleyman Demirel is contributing to the annihilation of 
separatism, requesting in his turn the official recognition of 
Gagauzians as a native people of Bessarabia." Referring to the 
policy promoted by the present leadership, considered by the 
FPCD antinational, the article concludes: "Today this territory 
is mined with controversial geopolitical interests. We can soon 
live the frightening forecast of Mrs. Catherine Lalumiere, 
ex-secretary of the Council of Europe, who declared that 
Bessarabia, belonging a little to Russia, a little to the 
Ukraine and a little to Turkey, could be an area of interference 
of spheres of influence of these three states."

  [Text] The Moldovan Vice-Premier Ion Gutu told a news 
conference in Kishinev [Chisinau] on Wednesday [8 June] that in 
1994 through 1997 the priorities of the new cabinet will be the 
strengthening of the economy, reforms, social security and the 
expansion of foreign trade. He also said that the government 
program of action will be discussed by parliamentary committees 
and then by a plenary session of parliament. 
  Gutu said the country has made certain financial 
achievements: in May the inflation rate was only 4 percent. 
  Falling production remains the main problem. In the first 
five months industrial production amounted to 71 percent of last 
year's level. The number of employed in industry dropped by a 
third. Many factories are sending their workers on unpaid leave. 
  Gutu said the government wants to suggest to parliament 
making urban land an article of trade, which in his opinion 
could attract foreign investments in the Moldovan economy.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Akimov] </F>
  [Text] Almaty 9 June TASS--A regular plenary session of the 
parliament of Kazakhstan began here on Thursday [9 June] with a 
speech by President Nursultan Nazarbayev. 
  Prior to the session, the president had addressed the 
parliament in a message, advocating an acceleration of 
market-oriented reforms and suggesting a wide package of 
measures to take the country's economy out of the crisis. 
  The message was officially referred to the parliament 
secretariat on Thursday morning. In the afternoon the message 
is expected to be presented to the deputies for study and 
discussion. 
  According to competent sources, the message makes a 
political 
evaluation of the internal situation in the country and 
Kazakhstan's foreign-policy stand, and the reform process, and 
analyses the activities of state power bodies to implement the 
strategic policy of building a democratic state with a market 
economy. 
  At the same time the message defines key orientations of 
state policy consistently to carry out reforms in all spheres of 
economic and social life, strengthen Kazakhstan's statehood and 
the socio-political unity of the peoples inhabiting it. 
  The message formulates clearly political and economic goals 
and sets appropriate tasks to power and administration bodies 
for a subsequent period. 
  The presidential message is manifestly aimed at 
consolidating 
all branches of state power and all forces of society and at 
mustering the efforts of all political parties, movements and 
associations and all robust potential of the state with a view 
to taking the country out of the deep crisis, deepening reforms, 
contributing towards democracy and strengthening the Republic's 
sovereignty.

  [Text] Russia may pay as much as $115 million annually to 
Kazakhstan for using the Baykonur space launching center under a 
draft treaty which Kazakh officials submitted to Russian 
negotiators. 
  Kazakh National Space Agency Director Aisultan Kalybayev 
told 
INTERFAX that the draft complied with the agreement that had 
been signed by Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Nursultan Nazarbayev 
on 28 March. 
  In particular, the launching pads and the buildings in the 
town of Leninsk will be rented by Russia for a term of 20 years, 
which may be extended for 10 more years. 
  Kazakhstan had earlier intended to have the rent increased. 
  Kalybayev also said that the electricity and water supply 
bills would be paid separately as would be those for temporary 
seizure of land area where parts of booster rockets might fall. 
The energy rates, he said, will not be higher than those paid 
by Kazakh consumers. 
  Kalybayev said the draft, which he had submitted to his 
Russian counterpart Yuri Koptev, will be finalized in Almaty. 
Koptev is also deputy chairman of the bilateral commission on 
Baykonur. 
  Kalybayev expressed the hope that officials from the two 
countries would meet no later than in mid-June.

<F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Konovalov: "Just One Day in Paris -- and </F>
$0.5 Billion in His Pocket"] 
  [Text] Brussels-Paris -- The way this is done was 
demonstrated by last week's visit to Belgium and France by a 
Kyrgyz delegation headed by the president. 
  Approximately 40 Kyrgyz entrepreneurs and leaders of various 
firms and companies flew into Brussels and then into Paris from 
Bishkek in the presidential aircraft along with 10 officials. 
While the president was engaged in big-league politics, they 
insistently sought partners and tried to set up business 
contacts and to sign contracts. 
  The matter hardly got as far as contracts, however, although 
Akayev did bring the "new Kyrgyz" with him to no avail. In my 
view, he needed these fellow travelers for propaganda purposes 
above all. He wanted to show Europe the new form of the Kyrgyz 
economy in the flesh so as to convince it that reforms are 
taking place in the Republic not just in words but are giving 
rise to market structures and a stratum of entrepreneurs 
prepared to cooperate on equal terms. 
  Of course, this is just one of the arguments. The stability 
of the national currency -- the som -- and the lowering of the 
rate of inflation, which has now stayed below the 5-percent 
level for more than one month, proved no less important. 
  But the main trump card was the carefully elaborated 
three-year program for deepening economic reform, which has been 
rated highly by international experts. But the decisive 
assessment and, accordingly, the size of the funding had to be 
determined by a meeting of the World Bank's Consultative Group 
on Kyrgyzia, where the program was defended by Akayev himself. 
  According to preliminary estimates by Kyrgyz specialists, if 
that defense succeeded, the delegation could have collected 
$350-$400 million from various sources of funding. The result 
exceeded expectations. The preferential credits, investments, 
and free aid allocated totaled $550 million for the coming 
conventional fiscal year (it begins 1 July, so Kyrgyzia managed 
to enroll almost at the last moment). 
  Participating in the meeting, in addition to the organizer, 
were representatives of the IMF, the European Bank for 
Reconstruction, and Development, the Asian Bank, the Islamic 
Bank, and a number of other organizations and donor countries. 
The participants' contributions differ in size and terms. A 
sizable proportion of the credits, for example, has been 
allocated for 40 years with a 10-year deferment and at an almost 
symbolic interest rate. 
  In order to successfully realize the funds allocated and 
extend the reforms' funding, serious projects for cooperation 
with foreign firms are needed. A whole package of agreements in 
this regard was signed in Belgium and France. Kyrgyzia's 
proposals elicited considerable interest among businessmen here. 
  In particular, it is proposed to jointly work deposits of 
nonferrous metals, to extract rare-earth elements and bauxites, 
to deliver wool and cotton, to produce telecommunications 
equipment, to produce uranium, to process agricultural 
produce.... 
  In general, emphasis is placed on setting up joint ventures 
in Kyrgyzia, which would like to become a supplier of all sorts 
of output to Central Asian countries. "We are virtually on the 
Great Silk Road," Akayev remarked, "and this is a very 
convenient position for winning a market in a vast region." 
  But Kyrgyzia clearly will not be able to exploit this 
opportunity by relying only on its own efforts, and so it is 
opening the door wide to cooperation. Of course, potential 
partners need reliable guarantees. Many are still scared off by 
political and economic instability in the region. Agreements on 
mutual protection for investments are one such guarantee. 
Another, in Akayev's opinion, is the fact that Kyrgyzia has 
joined the "Partnership for Peace" program, which happened at 
NATO headquarters in Brussels. 
  Will Kyrgyzia's participation in the "Partnership for Peace" 
program not complicate its relations with Russia, which, as is 
known, takes a special, complex approach to this NATO 
initiative? This question hovered persistently in the background 
at the ceremony at NATO headquarters and was asked at the final 
news conference. S. Balanzino, deputy and temporary acting 
secretary general of NATO, at once specified that it was a 
question not of any terms advanced by Russia but of the 
parameters of its participation in the program, which are still 
under discussion. 
  Askar Akayev supported that wording and declared that he 
voices full solidarity with the position of Russia, which, in 
his opinion, must participate in the program on different 
parameters to, let us say, Kyrgyzia or any other CIS country. 
Only in this case, he said, will the program play a role in 
ensuring peace and security in the CIS. 
  As for Kyrgyzia, according to Akayev, it is now reckoning on 
certain material support from NATO, above all, in conversion. 
In his opinion, the possibility of consulting and cooperating 
with NATO countries in the event of a threat to the Republic's 
territorial integrity will be important.

  [Excerpts] Dushanbe, 9 June -- The commander of Russian 
border troops in Tajikistan, Lieutenant General Anatoliy 
Chechulin, has described the operational situation on a wide 
section of the Tajik-Afghan border as extremely complex. He 
said the situation had deteriorated seriously during the last 
few days. The general was speaking at a hurriedly summoned news 
conference to discuss the latest major provocation against 
Russian border guards in the zone patrolled by the Moskovskiy 
border detachment. [passage omitted] 
  These provocations, Anatoliy Chechulin stressed, are not the 
best prelude for the second round of inter-Tajik talks 
provisionally scheduled for 17 June in Tehran. The Russian 
general pinned the blame for the continued provocations both on 
the extremist wing of the Tajik opposition and on the civilian 
and military authorities in certain Afghan border districts, who 
pay lip service to stabilization of the Afghan border situation 
but, at the same time, directly facilitate the staging of these 
provocations. He declared that the most decisive measures would 
be taken against "the instigators and organizers of aggression," 
whom the general held entirely responsible for the possible 
consequences.

  [Text] Dushanbe 9 June TASS -- A border post of the Moscow 
unit on the Tajik-Afghan border came under heavy artillery and 
mortar fire from Afghan territory on Wednesday [8 June] morning. 
Twenty-six artillery shells and mines hit the post between 0610 
and 0915 killing one soldier and wounding another, according to 
Lieutenant General Anatoliy Chechulin. 
  General Chechulin told a press conference here that both the 
soldiers were from a unit of Tajikistan's Defence Ministry 
assigned to reinforce the protection of the Tajik-Afghan border 
at the place. 
  The general stressed that the Russian border troops, none of 
which was hurt in the attack, were returning the fire. 
  The Russian commander said all responsibility for the 
consequences of the action must be taken by the Tajik opposition 
leader and military authorities of the Afghan border region, 
whose silent connivance made the major armed act of provocation 
possible.

  [Text] Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan today 
received Russian Defense Minister and Army General Pavel Grachev 
and the delegation accompanying him. 
  The question of granting the status of a military base to 
the 
Russian Federation Army units stationed in Armenia, the 
prospects of implementing the current plan for the peaceful 
settlement of the Karabakh problem, matters pertaining to the 
organization of Armenia's air defenses, and a number of other 
issues were discussed during the meeting. 
  State Minister Vazgen Sargisyan, Defense Minister Serzh 
Sargisyan, and Interior Minister Vano Siradegyan participated in 
the meeting. 
  Russian Defense Minister and Army General Pavel Grachev 
granted an interview to an ARMENPRES correspondent. Replying to 
a question on the purpose of his visit, he said that he is 
visiting Armenia at the invitation of Armenian President Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan to conduct talks on a number of military-political 
matters, particularly on cooperation between the two countries 
within the framework of the collective security agreement. The 
minister said that the [word indistinct] conditions for the 
deployment of the Russian Army units in the Republic will be 
discussed. Grachev added that matters relating to the 
Karabakh-Azerbaijani conflict will also be discussed during his 
visit to Armenia and meetings with the Republic's leadership. 
In this connection, he specifically emphasized that Armenia and 
Karabakh have signed the agreement on peaceful settlement of the 
conflict worked out with Russian mediation, whereas Azerbaijan 
has so far refrained from doing so. Therefore, after his visit 
to Georgia on Saturday he will go to Baku to meet Aliyev to 
propose that Azerbaijan finally sign the agreement. 
  Commenting on whether the number of Russian troops could be 
increased in Armenia, Grachev noted that there could only be 
talk of reducing them. 
  After his meeting with Armenian President Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan, Mr. Grachev told reporters that he is satisfied 
with the results of his talks with the Armenian president. The 
president and the Armenian people desire to have Russian bases 
on Armenian territory within the framework of the collective 
security agreement and on a bilateral basis to jointly ensure 
the security of Armenia and Russia. The Armenian president 
reiterated support for the implementation of that agreement [on 
Nagorno-Karabakh], which we formulated in Moscow, said the 
Russian defense minister. He added that he will leave for Baku 
on 11 June with these impressions and will ask Aliyev to once 
more reassess the situation and sign the agreement. He 
expressed the hope that after that a real and stable peace will 
be established in Nagorno-Karabakh.

  [Text] The Estonian-Russian talks on troop withdrawal will 
be continued in Moscow "maybe even next week," Russian Deputy 
Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin announced in Tallinn today. 
  Commenting on the results of his two-day meetings with 
Estonian Foreign Ministry Vice Chancellor Raul Malk, Churkin 
hoped that the parties would agree that social guarantees be 
given to retired Russian servicemen living in Estonia. Churkin 
said there must be a special document for preventing possible 
tension between Tallinn and Moscow. The document must be 
realistic and conform with the highest standards in human 
rights, Churkin pointed out. 
  Churkin did not rule out that Russian troops could be 
withdrawn from Estonia by August 31, 1994. 
  Russia conditions the troop withdrawal with social 
guarantees 
for retired Russian servicemen in Estonia (there are about 
11,000 of them). There are currently about 2,300 acting Russian 
servicemen in Estonia. 
  Commenting on the recent statement by Estonian Defense Force 
Commander Aleksander Einseln saying that if the appropriate 
order were received, force might be used to push out Russian 
servicemen who would remain in Estonia after August 31, Churkin 
said, "We have absolutely no doubt that the position of Estonia 
consists in settlement of all problems by political means, 
through negotiations. The position of Russia is the same."

  [Text] Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin, who 
left Tallinn at lunchtime today, stated at a briefing he gave at 
the airport that, if the will is there, 31 August is not at all 
an unrealistic deadline for the withdrawal of Russian troops. 
According to Churkin, a firm basis by way of a firm agreement is 
required, however, to (?resolve) issues in such an energetic 
manner. According to Churkin, a realistic agreement on Russian 
military pensioners must be concluded so as to eliminate 
tensions in Estonian-Russian relations. 
  During his two-day visit to Tallinn the Russian deputy 
foreign minister continued talks begun in Geneva with Raul Malk, 
the deputy chancellor of the Estonian Foreign Ministry, on 
Saturday [4 June]. Churkin also met with Estonian Prime Minister 
Mart Laar, Foreign Minister Juri Luik, and President Lennart 
Meri.

withdraw its troops by August 31, spokesman for the Russian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs Vitaliy Churkin said today that his 
country judged about Estonia's position by "responsible 
statements of responsible officials" and was sure that Estonia, 
just as Russia, favoured political solutions to all problems. 
  Churkin was speaking after a two-day meeting with his 
Estonian counterpart Raul Malk, which was held in pursuance of 
the accord reached during Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev's recent meeting in Tallinn with Estonian President 
Lennart Meri. 
  Churkin said the problem of the Russian military pensioners 
residing in Estonia remained in the centre of negotiations 
between Estonia and Russia, and expressed the hope that "a new 
page, and probably even a new chapter" will open in 
Russian-Estonian relations thanks to this and other forthcoming 
contacts. 
  Churkin said his talks in Tallinn centered around the 
withdrawal of Russian troops and the dismantling of Russian 
atomic reactors in the training centre for Russian submarine 
power plant operators in Paldiski. Churkin expressed confidence 
that the sides would reach an agreement which would be 
"realistic and rule out any tension in relations between the two 
countries". 
  As concerns the Russian military pensioners residing in the 
republic, Churkin expressed the confidence that the agreement on 
their fate will "also be realistic and meet the world's highest 
standards in the field of human rights".

  [Text] JURMALA, Jun 08, BNS - Latvia's foreign policy must 
remain the same after resignation of Foreign Minister Georgs 
Andrejevs, Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs said Tuesday at 
a press conference. 
  Birkavs stressed that the Saeima's [parliament] Latvian Way 
faction and the leading coalition must consider the appointing 
of a new foreign minister. 
  The new minister has rights to appoint his state ministers 
and the parliamentary secretary, said Birkavs. 
  Presently Gunars Meierovics, Olgerts Pavlovskis and Martins 
Virsis still occupy their posts. 
  Birkavs refused to name any concrete candidate to the post 
of 
the foreign minister. 
  Birkavs noted that, while he is performing the duties of the 
foreign minister, he wanted to make several important steps in 
the ministry's work because coordination of the Foreign 
Ministry's activities with other ministries' work is needed.

  [Text] RIGA, Jun 08, BNS - The Latvian Cabinet confirmed 
Tuesday an agreement on cooperation among the Baltic states' 
governments and parliaments. The agreement provides for 
formation of the Baltic Council, Latvian Justice Minister Egils 
Levits said at a press conference. 
  The formation of the Baltic Council means that there will be 
institutional cooperation among the Baltic prime ministers, 
ministers and parliaments as to coordinating their policies in 
legislation, economy, foreign trade, culture, transport and 
communication, said Levits. 
  The Baltic Council will consist of the Baltic Assembly, 
which 
was founded in 1991, and the Baltic Ministers Council. The 
Baltic council's resolutions will refer to all the Baltic states. 
  Levits considers that formation of the new institution will 
promote cooperation among Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. 
  The agreement on formation of the Baltic Council will be 
signed on June 13 in Tallin, during the meeting of the Baltic 
ministers. 
  The Baltic Council will be formed after the model of the 
Nordic States' Council.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jun 08, BNS -- The heads of Lithuanian and 
Russian negotiation teams said they are satisfied with the 
results reached at a round of talks in Vilnius June 7-8. 
  Viktor Isakov, head of the Russian delegation for talks with 
Lithuania, said the progress made in Vilnius is "modest, but 
nevertheless a contribution" to the development of bilateral 
relations. The Russian negotiator said the deadlock over 
Russian transit through Lithuanian territory remains the main 
problem, which also concerns Lithuania's most favored nation 
trade status. 
  The Russian diplomat said the connection between transit and 
trade appeared last year when talks on Russian troop withdrawal 
from Lithuania were coming to an end, and was confirmed at all 
further meetings between negotiators, as well as by the 
agreements signed. 
  Virgilijus Bulovas, head of the Lithuanian working group for 
talks with the CIS, said the talks were "constructive" and added 
that "more time and efforts are needed" to resolve the remaining 
problems. Bulovas said both sides agreed that Belarussian 
representatives should take part in talks on transit. 
  Isakov implied that the status of the Kaliningrad region in 
Lithuanian-Russian talks does not differ from the status of any 
other Russian region. The Russian diplomat said Kaliningrad can 
be granted special status only if such a law is adopted in 
Russia. 
  At a joint press conference Wednesday, both delegation 
leaders confirmed that Russian military transit through 
Lithuania was not discussed in Vilnius and that both sides only 
exchanged views on the issue. The only document signed during 
the Vilnius meeting was an agreement on the basic principles of 
settlements between Lithuania and Russia. The accord was signed 
by representatives of Lithuanian and Russian central banks. 
Negotiators initialled an agreement on cooperation between 
customs and virtually completed preparation of an agreement on 
contract employees. 
  Isakov said the next round of talks is likely to be held 
before September. The exact date will depend on the work of 
experts, he said. Discussing issues that may be discussed at 
the next round of talks, Bulovas mentioned mutual travel, 
cultural values, nuclear energy, fishing and environment 
protection.

  [Text] VILNIUS, Jun 08, BNS - The two-day round of 
Lithuanian- Russian talks that started in Vilnius Tuesday is 
unlikely to produce as many results as were expected by the 
Lithuanian side. 
  Before the meeting, Russia did not comment on any possible 
results whereas the Lithuanian side said it expects to make 
progress in a number of issues, including Russian transit 
through Lithuania and implementation of bilateral economic 
treaties that have been signed earlier. 
  But according to unofficial reports from the Lithuanian 
Foreign Ministry, the number of issues on the meeting's agenda 
was considerably reduced and primary attention is paid only to 
several most important problems. 
  On Tuesday, Lithuanian and Russian negotiators initialed an 
agreement on contract employees. The accord mainly deals with 
social guarantees to people temporarily employed in one of the 
two countries. 
  The Russian delegation refused to discuss a draft agreement 
on additional border crossings between Lithuania and the 
Kaliningrad region, saying it has no such authorizations. 
  The Lithuanian side once again suggested to clear up the 
region's status in the process of Lithuanian-Russian talks. 
Russian negotiators said the problem can be resolved by a 
special Russian law.

  [Text] Mainz June 9 TASS -- All reports in the Russian 
press about possible changes in the leadership of the Russian 
Government, including allegations concerning Viktor 
Chernomyrdin's possible resignation as prime minister, are 
"absolutely at variance with reality and no more than 
inventions", according to sources close to the head of the 
Russian Government, who is now undergoing medical examination 
and treatment in the urological clinic of Johann Gutenberg 
University. 
  The sources said the medical consultations, which followed 
the preliminary medical examination in connection with the prime 
minister's nephrolithiasis, proceeded successfully. According 
to the same sources, some forces were obviously seeking to bank 
on the current situation.

"Chernomyrdin Will Soon Return to Moscow. German Specialists

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] According to the DPA agency, 
"seven specialists have examined Chernomyrdin but made no 
diagnosis. According to chief urologist Professor Rudolf 
Gogenfellner, Chernomyrdin's health condition is excellent." 
  The question arises: Is Chernomyrdin's unexpected trip to 
Germany a way of "setting the stage" for his resignation "for 
health reasons"? It is noteworthy that, according to a source 
in the Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry, people from the 
entourage of First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets, who are 
currently staying with him in Malaysia, indicated that their 
"chief" might soon become prime minister. Oleg Soskovets, who 
did not rule out such a possibility, seems to be further 
distancing himself from his boss. 
  Another likely candidate for the post of head of government 
-- Commodity Producers Federation Chairman Yuriy Skokov -- is 
behaving amazingly calmly in this situation. According to a 
source in the federation apparatus, the federation is working in 
a normal mode.

  [Text] Moscow June 9 TASS -- Confidence that "a single 
confederative state will appear with time on the territory of 
the former Soviet Union" was voiced by Federation Council 
chairman Vladimir Shumeyko during today's meeting with 
journalists in Moscow. Shumeyko added that "later, we shall 
probably live to see a federation, each member of which will 
remain free". 
  According to Vladimir Shumeyko, the former Soviet republics 
will never give up their freedom, but will continue to gravitate 
towards one another on the strength of their economic, cultural, 
and spiritual traditions. Shumeyko noted that the Baltic 
republics alone are not "seeking contacts with the former Union 
parts, while all the others are feeling the attraction". 
  In this connection, the head of the upper chamber of the 
Russian parliament expressed his belief that in Byelorussia 
[Belarus] and Ukraine "the people will vote in the presidential 
elections for those whose attitude to Russia they think correct". 
  Vladimir Shumeyko said the council of the heads of 
parliaments of the Commonwealth member-states, which met in St. 
Petersburg the other day, discussed strengthening economic ties 
in the framework of the Commonwealth of Independent States. 
Participants in the discussion said the creation of a strong 
union can be boosted by legislative acts and it is necessary to 
"provide a legal frame for the economic union". 
  The council adopted a resolution on CIS peacekeeping forces, 
which also calls for preparing a relevant regulation. Shumeyko 
noted that the CIS peacekeeping forces already exist de facto, 
but mainly at a cost to Russia. According to Shumeyko, this 
gives rise to rumours about Russia's alleged imperial ambitions. 
In order to avoid such rumours and ease Russia's economic 
burden in maintaining the forces, it is necessary to create CIS 
collective forces. 
  Shumeyko said that the participants in the St. Petersburg 
forum called for joining the Commonwealth summit on September 9 
to discuss this proposal, as well as preparations for the 
festivities marking the fiftieth anniversary of the victory in 
the last world war.

<F P=106> [Ilya Bulavinov report: "The Federation Council Speaker </F>
Will Take Care of Security"] 
  [Text] Recently there has been a series of edicts on 
including new state officials into the Security Council. But 
Boris Yeltsin's latest appointments stand out from this crowd. 
Two weeks ago it was announced that Ivan Rybkin has become a 
member of the Security Council. Now the other speaker -- 
Vladimir Shumeyko -- has been included into the council as a 
non-permanent member. With this appointment the president 
honors the terms of the national accord pact while the speaker 
gets the possibility to expand his presence on the Russian 
political Olympus. 
  The edict appointing Vladimir Shumeyko to the Security 
Council lay in the Kremlin exactly two weeks: It is dated 23 
May (on that day Ivan Rybkin was officially co-opted into the 
Security Council). An official in the presidential 
administration explained that the delay in promulgating the 
edict was due not to political but to "diplomatic" reasons: The 
Kremlin thought it unethical to publish the edict before the 
Federation Council speaker's return from his Latin American tour. 
  As far as Shumeyko himself is concerned, this course of 
events is very opportune. Expanded powers are vital at present 
for the speaker of the parliament's upper chamber. With all the 
importance of Shumeyko's position, and his authority in the 
Federation Council, his prospects as a politician are at best 
foggy. Under the Constitution, beginning in 1995 Federation 
Council members will not be elected but appointed: One 
representative from the legislative and executive branch of each 
component. And in accordance with the fundamental law, the 
career of Shumeyko the senator is to end (unless, of course, 
corresponding changes are made in the Constitution) in a year 
and a half. 
  Shumeyko's life shows that he is not among those who would 
be 
happy to continue his career as an ambassador or president of 
some foundation. Likewise, after his position as chairman of 
the parliament upper chamber, he will hardly be content with a 
mere deputyship. Perhaps the sole place acceptable to Shumeyko 
is the president's chair. But the play for the presidency 
involves a great number of dangers: Everyone remembers Sergey 
Shakhray's sad experience. Moreover, participation in elections 
as Yeltsin's rival not only reduces Shumeyko's chances to zero, 
but could also mar his relations with long-standing associates. 
Yet something else is also remembered. Boris Yeltsin once let 
drop a phrase to the effect that a new leader should be at least 
tall enough and that he, Yeltsin, intends to breed his own 
successor. Obviously such statements by the president could not 
but set Shumeyko thinking in a certain direction. 
  Therefore, if Yeltsin does not run for another term, 
Shumeyko's candidacy as "heir" will be quite in place. His 
connections with regional leaders and his contacts (in the post 
of chairman of the Interparliamentary Assembly) with the CIS 
state leadership will be to his advantage. Yet the seriousness 
of Shumeyko's intentions comes through especially clearly in his 
efforts to promote friendly relations with the army. On 21 
April Vladimir Shumeyko stated that he "intends to get 
acquainted with all branches of the Armed Forces and meet their 
commanders and personnel." Unlike the president, who has 
apparently forgotten about his monthly "military day," the 
speaker conscientiously visits military units. He accompanies 
these trips by loud statements about the need to increase the 
military budget and revise articles of military laws granting 
service deferments to too many -- in the military's opinion -- 
of those liable for conscription. Moreover, Shumeyko has taken 
such a liking to the Baltic Fleet sailors that he decided to 
"adopt" (of course, on behalf of the Federation Council) a 
missile carrier. 
  The speaker's rising influence cannot but be enhanced by his 
participation in Security Council sessions. The possibility of 
promoting good relations with the power ministers, participation 
in discussing the key aspects of national security, and finally 
the mere presence in the presidential "inner circle" should help 
Vladimir Shumeyko prepare a reliable bridgehead for subsequent 
maneuvers.

<F P=106> [Article by Vadim Viktorov: "Vladimir Shumeyko and Weapons: </F>
Is There a `Bridge' Between Them?"] 
  [Text] The star of the former general director of the 
Krasnodar measuring instruments plant started to be in the 
ascendant on the political horizon in November 1991 when he was 
elected deputy chairman of the Russian Supreme Soviet. In June 
of the following year he joined the government -- immediately as 
first vice premier. And early this year there was V.Sh.'s 
"second coming" on the field of legislative power -- he was 
elected chairman of the upper chamber of the new Russian 
parliament -- the Federation Council. 
  It cannot be said that V.Sh. has outstanding professional 
abilities. Outwardly there is no sign that he relies on any 
influential political or economic forces. He has always stood 
alone in the "democrats" camp but not, like some, by belonging 
to B. Yeltsin's closest entourage. Coming from the directors' 
corps, V.Sh. is not an expressor of the interests of the 
military-industrial complex, and he is also a stranger to the 
"raw material" and "agrarian" lobbies. Nor does he have any 
authority in the "new business" milieu. What secures such 
"tenacity" for V.Sh. on the political Olympus? 
  We do not want to draw conclusions, but some facts are 
interesting in themselves. 
  An attentive observer may have noticed the regular proximity 
of events connected with V.Sh. on the one hand and the "Most" 
["Bridge"] financial group on the other. Perhaps this is 
fortuitous but it is a case of lightning striking more than once 
in the same place. 
  The first example is connected with the NTV television 
company created and financed by the "Most" holding. In the 
summer of last year V.Sh. supported NTV's plans, speaking also 
of presidential support for the idea of handing over the fourth 
television channel "most likely to the 'Most' financial group 
and several commercial banks which do not belong to it." 
  After the 3-4 October events V.Sh. was put at the head of 
the 
Ministry of Information and the Press -- and in October NTV 
broadcasting on the St. Petersburg channel began. In late 
December the decision to transfer the fourth channel to the 
television company belonging to "Most" was finally made -- and 
V.Sh. leaves this post (in connection with the ministry's 
abolition). And a little later he leaves the government too. 
On 17 January 1994 NTV began broadcasting as the owner of the 
television channel, "timed" precisely for the moment when V.Sh. 
won the hard struggle for the post of Federation Council 
chairman. 
  A second example. In November last year the president signed 
an edict on the creation of the "Rosvooruzheniye" state company 
which monopolized all operations for the export and import of 
arms and military equipment. The company swallowed up all three 
relevant foreign trade associations and received the nickname 
"Rosvor" ["vor" element of the name means "thief" in Russian] 
perhaps from military-industrial complex enterprises 
dissatisfied with its creation. V.Sh. was involved in this 
edict, which is proved by his signature on the document. The 
weekly KOMMERSANT even awarded V.Sh. the title of "founding 
father" of the company. Moreover, V.Sh.'s former military 
adviser -- Lieutenant General Viktor Samoylov -- was put at the 
head of "Rosvooruzheniye." The principle of having "his own 
man" operated in this appointment since Samoylov has 
professional experience in a rather different field: Before 
becoming an adviser V. Samoylov worked for nearly 10 years in 
the Defense Ministry Main Cadres Directorate. 
  And after a while "Most" appears here -- as one of 
authorized 
banks of the "Rosvooruzheniye" company. 
  Analysts have drawn attention to the fact that the choice of 
authorized banks is rather strange: They did not include those 
who had any experience of cooperating with official arms 
dealers. Not even the Foreign Trade Bank of Russia 
[Vneshtorgbank]. Obviously the "top brass" had some reasons of 
their own for this decision. Of course they did, for the status 
of authorized bank imparts great responsibility. It was 
KOMMERSANT again which reported that "Rosvooruzheniye" had been 
allocated free credit for three years worth 1 trillion (!) 
rubles for purchases of arms and military equipment from Russian 
producers and that in April the money had already been 
transferred to the accounts of the company, that is Most-bank. 
You can understand yourselves that keeping such a sum involves 
a lot of responsibility. What is interesting is that the next 
month the government actually repealed the arms export monopoly 
to establish which "Rosvooruzheniye" was created. 
  But let us return to the main subject and not a couple more 
coincidences. One is serious: V.Sh. (he is also chairman of 
the CIS countries' interparliamentary assembly) only had to 
persuade the Azerbaijan leaders in Bishkek to sign peace 
agreements on Nagorno-Karabakh and a week later the newspaper 
SEGODNYA (also financed by "Most") reported that "Most-bank has 
been authorized by the Azerbaijan Government to carry out 
clearing operations between the two sides' enterprises." 
  There is another, simpler, coincidence (it could be 
considered purely fortuitous were it not for all the preceding 
information): The not unknown D. Yakubovskiy, who was also one 
of V.Sh.'s advisers, after the noisy corruption scandal had died 
down, registered a legal firm in Moscow whose clients include 
among others the "Most" group. 
  Let us add a further series of "coincidences" (perhaps 
fortuitous). 
  The middle of last year proceeded in Russia under the banner 
of the struggle against corruption, at whose epicenter there 
were two top officials -- Vice Premier Shumeyko and Vice 
President Rutskoy. One half of the "fighters" poured "suitcases" 
of compromising material onto the other, the other responded in 
the same vein. A large part in kindling the conflict was played 
by the figure of Yakubovskiy, whose importance was excessively 
"inflated" but this made it possible within the tentacles of the 
SEABECO "octopus" a certain trust contract allegedly signed by 
the vice president. Eventually on 1 September 1993 by a 
presidential edict A. Rutskoy and V. Shumeyko were both relieved 
of their duties in connection with the investigation which was 
being conducted into the "corruption case." It is well known 
how all this ended. Why have I said all this? The point is that 
former military pilot A. Rutskoy at the time had a marked 
"weakness" for the sphere of military-technical cooperation with 
foreign countries. During some of his visits there were 
discussions of questions of supplying arms, and it cannot be 
said this was without results. 
  Yet incidentally the potential for Russian arms exports in 
monetary terms is billions of dollars (it can be measured in 
rubles -- the figure of R1 trillion has already been mentioned 
above and it is clear it is not the only figure) 
  Next, in the summer of last year Sergey Glazyev, the then 
minister of foreign economic relations, only had to engage in 
the introduction of order into the system of military-technical 
cooperation resulting in the dismissal of the leaders of the 
"Oboroneksport" all-Russia association for Glazyev to be struck 
a "blow" whose initiator was V.Sh. A directive from the latter 
caused the return of the aircraft on which a delegation headed 
by the leader of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations was 
setting off 20 August on an official visit to African countries. 
The cancellation of the visit in this form is a fact 
unprecedented in world practice and was an ostentatious insult 
to S. Glazyev. As a result he tendered his resignation. It is 
true that his resignation was not accepted and the minister 
worked for a further month and resigned on his second attempt 
when on 21 September at the same time as the publication of the 
notorious edict no. 1400 the president brought back V.Sh. who 
had been "temporarily suspended from his duties." 
  We cannot fail to note V.Sh.'s "talent" in the form of his 
ability to put forward and use his "own" people. V. Samoylov 
and D. Yakubovskiy are not the only examples. One more former 
adviser -- Igor Shurchkov -- now heads the Russian Federation 
state committee for industrial policy. And quite recently 
V.Sh.'s fellow countryman -- Nikolay Yegorov, head of the 
Krasnodar Kray administration -- was appointed minister for 
nationalities affairs and regional policy in place of S. 
Shakhray. 
  Everything that has been said above can be interpreted in 
various ways but it is clear at least that V.Sh.'s "rear" is 
reliable and he knows how to keep it well covered, and this 
enables him skillfully to wage a behind-the-scenes struggle in 
the corridors of power. And if V.Sh. is thinking of entering 
the struggle for the post of president, then he can secure quite 
good support -- both financial and organizational. And the post 
of head of the Federation Council may very well be used for the 
advance forming of the image of the "gatherer of Russian lands" 
(which V.Sh. began to do in the middle of May). He has 
virtually everything, he merely has to "play and win." 
  One wonders whether "Most" is not creating its information 
"empire" with this game?

column: "Gaydar Has Breached an `Iron Curtain'"] 
  [Text] The day before yesterday Boris Yeltsin and Yegor 
Gaydar had an eye-to-eye meeting. MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS asked 
Yegor Timurovich for details. The Russia's Choice leader said 
that they had discussed the general political situation in the 
country and problems related to the package of economic edicts 
both already signed by the president and those that will come 
out shortly. During their confidential meeting they also 
discussed the formation of the Russia's Choice party, in which 
the president is taking an "interest." Chances are that Yeltsin 
will not attend the Choice founding congress on 12 June but, 
according to Gaydar, he relates positively to Russia's Choice, 
and the formula "Russia's Choice is the party the president 
leans on" is still in force. 
  Just a few months ago democratic leaders were complaining 
about the Yeltsin apparatus, which "closed" the president to 
contacts. Now, however, Yegor Timurovich noted, "the situation 
is developing in an extremely positive way."

  [Text] Speaking at a news conference in Moscow today, 
leader of the communists in the Russian State Duma Gennadiy 
Zyuganov did not rule out the possibility that in 
September-October 1994 the authorities will launch what he 
called another blitzkrieg: presidential elections. 
  Speaking of his recent tour of the Volga region and Russia's 
far north he said he had seen a sharp economic decline and a 
sharp rise in crime. He said that if this trend continues, the 
introduction of extraordinary measures by any government is 
inevitable within the next few months. 
  Zyuganov also spoke of what he called favorable symptoms: 
All the regions he visited have swung to the political left and 
the position of the Communist Party has strengthened greatly. 
He said that what is called the democratic government has no 
prestige in these regions. 
  He said that the best next move before the introduction of a 
state of emergency would be that suggested by the Accord for 
Russia movement: To work out a common opposition program, 
propose a team capable of carrying it out, unite political 
efforts and win over industrial circles and trade unions.

  [Text] Moscow June 8 TASS -- Russian communist leader 
Gennadiy Zyuganov described the economic situation in Russia as 
catastrophic. 
  Speaking at a news conference in Moscow on Wednesday, 
Zyuganov said that the country has become completely 
ungovernable and social tension continues to grow. Social and 
economic ties are falling apart. 
  Summing the results of his trip to several Russian regions, 
Zyuganov said that local officials called for a strong and 
capable government whose powers must be separated from the 
powers of presidential structures, which, as they claim, 
"interfere in the economic management" and get in the 
government's way. 
  To solve the food problem, Zyuganov suggested "establishing 
the minimum consumer basket and returning to state regulation of 
prices of basic necessities, including rationing." 
  He stressed the need for changing the liberal economic 
policy 
which has failed. "We will have to use measures of state 
regulation, primarily in power engineering, transportation, 
communications and agriculture," he said. 
  Zyuganov also believes that Russia should offer Ukraine, 
Byelorussia [Belarus] and Kazakhstan to set up a body to 
coordinate economic management and restore the severed ties. 
Another task is to fight crime and corruption and restore law 
and order in the country. 
  Zyuganov noted that no one will support the idea of a 
general 
political strike in Russia, adding that the question of early 
presidential elections -- in September-October -- "may emerge 
within the presidential structures themselves."

  [Text] Yekaterinburg June 9 TASS -- Ex-Procurator General 
of the Russian Federation Aleksey Kazannik, sacked by President 
Yeltsin after the amnesty of the latter's political rivals, and 
his supporters in the Urals and Siberia are now working to found 
a new political party, which they call "The Party of People's 
Conscience." 
  The party's founding congress is due to take place in 
Yekaterinburg on Friday. 
  According to prepared documents, the party seeks to bring 
together Russia's intellectual potential and concentrate on 
implementing a theoretically-based reform policy and forming 
competent governing structures, including the federal government. 
  The party intends to announce that it would form 
"constructive opposition" to the present authorities, reject the 
ideology of the Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia and Russian 
National Unity. 
  At the same time, the Kazannik party will be ready to team 
up 
with all sound- and patriotically-minded associations.

<F P=106> [Igor Spiridonov report under the "Party Organizational </F>

Former Russian General Prosecutor Creates Party of a New Type"] 
  [Text] Aleksey Kazannik, professor of the state and 
municipal law department of Omsk University, has already 
registered the oblast organization of a Party of People's 
Conscience [PPC]. The new movement sets itself the task "to 
formulate conditions to guarantee society against an inflow of 
dishonest people into the power structures, and against the 
making of incompetent decisions," as well as to create a system 
for the selection of personnel and a mechanism of control over 
the formulaic passing and retraction of decisions at all levels. 
Only highly moral and law-abiding citizens can join the party. 
The PPC counts on support from broad sections of the population, 
from workers to peasants to entrepreneurs, who identify their 
future with the prosperity of Russia. 
  According to Mr. Kazannik, he has already received requests 
from representatives of 47 regions in the country for the PPC's 
program documents so as to set up branches of the party in the 
regions. The founding conference of the PPC may be held as 
early as the fall, and the new party will be registered on the 
federal level.

  [Text] Moscow June 8 TASS -- Six defectors from 
Zhirinovskiy's faction in the Russian State Duma have announced 
the creation of their own parliamentary group called "Derzhava" 
(Great Power). 
  The ex-Zhirinovtsi, who earlier voiced their intentions to 
join far liberal "Union of December 12" faction, this time 
declared that they would contribute to the realisation of the 
idea to set up the nation-wide patriotic "Derzhava" movement 
proclaimed recently by former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy. 
  Rutskoy's camp seems to be not happy with such allies. 
Chairman of Rutskoy's Russian Social-Democratic People's Party 
[RSDPP] Vasiliy Lipitskiy told TASS today that the statement of 
Zhirinovskiy's defectors "is in no way in line with the 
interests and objectives of the RSDPP". He said that they have 
made "a false step" by using the name "Derzhava" for their own 
purposes. 
  "I really doubt whether the deputies who have not yet 
displayed any solid principles would be able to represent 
interests of any public movement", Lipitskiy said. 
  According to the State Duma's regulations, a new 
parliamentary group needs to enlist at least 35 MPs to be 
officially registered.

<F P=106> [Roman Ukolov report under the "Statistics" rubric: </F>
"Criminals Increasingly Prefer To Shoot"] 
  [Text] Militia Lieutenant General Vyacheslav Ogorodnikov, 
head of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs Public Order 
Directorate, made public yesterday some of the statistics on the 
illicit arms trade as well as statistics on the dynamics of 
crimes involving the use of firearms. 
  In the last three years, in his words, the number of such 
crimes has risen from 4,000 to 22,500. One in every nine 
murders is committed involving firearms. Last year, 1,366 
handguns and revolvers, 1,946 automatic rifles, 140 machine 
guns, six missile launchers, and 33 grenade launchers were 
seized from criminals. 
  Participants in the news briefing noted that there are 
several avenues through which weapons reach the "black market." 
The first, and the most massive, is the smuggling of weapons 
from "hot spots" in the CIS states. The second avenue is the 
stealing of weapons from factories producing firearms. Recently 
14 groups of criminals who were stealing the main product have 
been discovered at the Tula firearms plant alone. In Izhevsk, 
the activity of a group of "Izhmash" production association 
employees, who carried out thefts of automatic weapons which 
they later sold, was cut short. Thefts are committed also at 
Defense Ministry installations located on the territory of 
Russia. As in the case of the plants, the reason for arms 
"leaks" consists in unsatisfactory arrangements for storing them 
and unreliable guards.

Rubles In Compensation"] 
  [Text] The Perovskiy district court in Moscow passed a 
decision yesterday under which the General Prosecutor's Office 
should pay Vil Mirzayanov 20 million rubles (R) for causing 
damage to his moral and physical state, and for illegal 
prosecution, while the Organic Chemistry Research Institute, 
where the scientist was earlier in charge of the department for 
counteracting foreign intelligence services, should pay him a 
further R10 million. The court rejected Vil Mirzayanov's suit 
against the Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS] on the 
grounds that the FCS -- after the Security Ministry was 
abolished and primary investigation functions were transferred 
to the Prosecutor's Office -- is no successor to the Security 
Ministry. "This is the first case in which the court has 
defended the interests of a citizen who suffered from the 
state's high-handedness," said Aleksandr Asnis, the scientist's 
lawyer.

  [Text] Vice-Premier Anatoliy Chubays in an exclusive 
interview with the Financial Information Agency today said that 
after the deadline for using privatization vouchers (July 1) 
Russians might still have about 5 million unused vouchers (over 
three percent of the 148 million vouchers distributed among 
Russian citizens). 
  "Inevitably a part of the vouchers will remain unused. 
However, those five million amount to only three percent of the 
total number and the fact that 97 percent of Russians will have 
used their vouchers by July 1 is an indication of the 
large-scale success of privatization", Chubays said. 
  At a Wednesday news conference in Moscow Chubays said that 
by 
June 6, 126 million vouchers had been invested. The State 
Property Committee will auction 63 very promising companies for 
vouchers this month, among them platinum producer Norilsk Nikel, 
the oil company Megionneftegas and the Beryozka chain of stores. 
  Chubays said that this unprecedented drive will allow 
Russians who have not yet invested their vouchers to exercise 
their right to purchase a share of former government property. 
He denied rumors about the prolongation of privatization for 
vouchers, stressing that July 1 was the deadline. 
  Commenting on the results of privatization, Chubays said 
that 
by June Russia had turned 18 out of 22 thousand big and 
medium-sized companies subject to privatization into joint-stock 
companies. Over 50 percent of industry is now privately owned, 
by July 1 the figure should grow to 70 percent. Over 250 major 
manufacturing facilities have been sold through national 
auctions held in 86 regions. Since the beginning of the year 
government property worth 45 billion rubles was sold for 
vouchers at auctions. Chubays said he believed the figure in 
June would be 93 billion. 
  Chubays said that most of the 600 voucher investment funds 
had held the first meetings of share-holders over the past two 
months and paid small but acceptable dividends. 
  He added that the State Property Committee has serious 
complaints against 15 funds and their operations will be 
investigated. 
  Speaking of privatization after the expiry date for 
vouchers, 
Chubays said that by June 15 amendments to the draft program 
will be collected and after that the program will be submitted 
to the government for final approval. He said that after July 1 
it is expected that some 20 percent of government property be 
sold for cash.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Prime Minister Anatoliy Chubays and </F>
Moscow City Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov by Itogi announcer Yevgeniy 
Kiselev -- date and place not given; from the "Itogi" newscast 
-- recorded] 
  [Text] [Kiselev] It seems that none of last week's events 
has evoked such an intense interest in the media as a sharp 
aggravation of the conflict between Deputy Prime Minister 
Anatoliy Chubays and Moscow's Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov. It is known 
that Yuriy Luzhkov maintains that privatization in Moscow should 
be implemented taking into account the capital's individual 
characteristics. Luzhkov sharply criticized the Chubays-style 
privatization. Anatoliy Chubays has his own arguments and 
position. You will get more details from interviews with both 
sides of this dispute about fundamental principles. 
  [Luzhkov] We have made our decision on all the conditions of 
privatization in Moscow proceeding from the city's interests, 
and I see no need to change anything in our attitude to what is 
taking place in the sphere of privatization. 
  [Kiselev] Even despite Anatoliy Borisovich's [Chubays'] 
appeal to the procuracy demanding that not only this decision 
but a number of others, too, should be cancelled? 
  [Luzhkov] I can say that Chubays' appeal to the Russian 
procuracy has no legal grounds, it is nothing but a 
demonstration and a wish to intimidate the Moscow government and 
myself. I think that the procuracy will draw an unequivocal 
conclusion regarding the way we comply with Russian Federation 
laws. We have not violated Russian laws. We are speaking about 
our attitude to privatization, the results of its first stage 
and the failings and failures of the first stage of 
privatization. The state budget has not received anything, 
there are no property owners, there is no middle class and 
territorial individual characteristics are being neglected. 
Now, when speaking about the shaping of the second stage Mr. 
Chubays says that the second stage will be based on the 
achievements of the first step in privatization. What 
achievements? There is a total failure, a complete mess! What 
achievements can we talk about? 
  [Chubays] My position is very simple. After all, I am not 
discussing the advantages and disadvantages of privatization 
with Luzhkov. I am not discussing with Luzhkov whether it is 
good or bad. I am not discussing with Luzhkov whether he likes 
it or not. I am speaking about something completely different. 
I am not debating. I demand that Luzhkov comply with the 
Russian legislation, Russian laws, the decrees signed by the 
Russian president, the government decisions signed by 
Chernomyrdin... 
  [Kiselev interrupts] Anatoliy Borisovich, excuse me for 
interrupting you but do you not think that your tough attitude 
toward Moscow Mayor Luzhkov on privatization issues is 
indirectly affecting the president, his political prestige and 
authority? After all, at the time the president instructed you 
to take into account Moscow's individual characteristics while 
implementing the privatization program. 
  [Chubays] I think that what does affect the president very 
strongly and is directed right against the president is not my 
stand on the issue but the blatant violation of presidential 
decrees currently in force by Mr. Luzhkov who continues to 
regard himself as a supporter of the president. 
  [Kiselev] Yuriy Mikhaylovich [Luzhkov], considering that the 
president has given Chubays his political support, are you not 
afraid to incur the president's displeasure because of your 
criticism of Anatoliy Borisovich? 
  [Luzhkov] I am not afraid and I will tell you why. First, 
because as early as last December I told Boris Nikolayevich 
[Yeltsin] that we had arguments against Chubays' methods and 
asked him to receive us. Boris Nikolayevich met with Chubays 
and myself and after listening to both of us, made a decision. 
He instructed Mr. Chubays to prepare a draft decree which would 
consolidate the individual characteristics of privatization in 
Moscow, because in his view privatization issues should be 
solved in a somewhat different manner while preserving the goals 
and the main principle of reforming the economy. 
  Well, one must say that Chubays failed to comply with the 
instruction, despite the fact that an absolutely unequivocal and 
clear instruction was given to prepare a relevant draft decree. 
Following this, a couple of months later I sent Boris 
Nikolayevich a letter saying that his instruction was being 
ignored. So he [Yeltsin] gave instructions again, this time to 
Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin, to take into account Moscow's 
individual characteristics and prepare relevant documents which 
would ensure a legal right to implement these characteristics. 
So another few months passed but no decision has been made. I 
therefore believe that in this situation I have a free hand to 
act in order to protect the city's interests. 
  [Chubays] In fact, I am not at all against a compromise with 
Moscow. I am truly prepared to design compromise plans 
applicable to Moscow. But excuse me, as soon as these plans 
have been approved I will observe them as much as I observe all 
other presidential instructions. Until such a plan has been 
designed, as long as the presidential decree on privatization is 
in force, Luzhkov must comply with it in exactly the same way as 
all other heads of administration. 
  [Kiselev] But where is the obstacle to designing such a 
compromise plan? Who is to design it, you or Luzhkov or jointly? 
  [Chubays] I think that Mr. Luzhkov's obvious ambition is the 
obstacle. As you know, we have put forward a concept of 
post-voucher privatization. Luzhkov's main demands are as 
follows: First of all, property must not be sold for vouchers 
because the vouchers have no value, nobody needs them, so 
property should be sold for money. But the concept of 
post-voucher privatization envisions selling for money. 
  Second, Luzhkov used to say that one must not sell so 
cheaply, much higher prices should be set, property costs much 
more and it should be revalued. In our concept of post-voucher 
privatization we proposed that the value of property should be 
increased at least 12-fold. 
  Third, Luzhkov said heads of administration should be 
invested with the right to alter the value of property taking 
into account local conditions. The concept of post-voucher 
privatization says in black and white that heads [of 
administration] are allowed to alter the value of property 
within a range of up to 200 percent. I could comment on the 
list of demands in greater detail. Look, in this situation 
Luzhkov should have become, I do not know, chairman of a 
movement in support of Chubays' post-voucher privatization, 
leader of the movement if he had been really interested in the 
matter and the essence of arguments and not the emotional and 
political layers enveloping them. 
  [Luzhkov] We do not like the second stage for quite 
understandable reasons -- the same ones which accompanied the 
failure of the first steps toward privatization. We are saying 
again that the individual characteristics of the regions need to 
be taken into account. And with the second stage of 
privatization Mr. Chubays and the State Property Committee are 
again saying: No, everything must progress only as the State 
Property and as Mr.Chubays instructs. 
  And this privatization is not always needed and is not 
always 
useful, for the City of Moscow, for example. With regard to the 
privatization of markets, for example. How can we privatize 
markets today when criminal bodies may buy them up? And if we 
find it difficult to fight these criminal bodies today when they 
don't own the markets, imagine the conditions under which our 
law enforcement bodies will be working when the markets belong 
to these criminal bodies. Or with the privatization of hotels, 
for example, the same reason applies, and in addition to this 
hotels pay a decent amount into the city's budget. 
  As far as privatization is concerned, we probably need to 
discuss the fact that privatization should primarily be carried 
out for economic reasons. If it is advantageous, if the city 
and the city authorities think that things should be sold, that 
it cannot manage the property effectively, that the property is 
not profitable enough, then there is no problem. It should be 
sold. But if it is of benefit to the city then the city should 
probably work out for itself what to do with the property. This 
does not mean we wish to keep property for ourselves, not at all. 
  Our main aim is to emphasize the problem of the economy and 
the problem of economic expediency. Chubays, the proponent of 
the market, says you do not have the right to auction and to 
sell real estate in the City of Moscow at the price fetched at 
the auction itself. You are limited to the value of two years 
rent. Well, please, is this really a market? Is Chubays, the 
democrat and proponent of the market, really offering a 
democratic approach to the state? It is a monopoly. It is 
arm-twisting, which does not allow the city to solve its 
problems in the economic sphere as the city considers expedient. 
  [Chubays] It is not the actual problem which is important 
but 
the political game-playing in which Mr. Luzhkov is engaging here. 
  [Kiselev] What exactly are these political games? 
  [Chubays] That is quite simple. You probably remember that I 
made a statement about six months ago that Yuriy Mikhailovich 
Luzhkov had begun his presidential campaign. This provoked a 
very skeptical reaction from many people and very few people 
took it seriously. They thought that Chubays had just decided 
to make all kinds of accusations against Luzhkov. No serious 
expert has any doubt today that Mr. Luzhkov is conducting an 
active election campaign, an election campaign for the post of 
Russian president. And that is what has triggered all of this. 
  [Kiselev] Yuriy Mikhailovich categorically denies any 
intention to start a presidential campaign. 
  [Chubays] Yes, I heard one of his denials. It is traditional 
for many politicians to deny things until the last minute, to 
make people beg them to agree and then agree. 
  [Kiselev] Excuse me, Anatoliy Borisovich, but do you not 
think that in accusing Luzhkov of presidential ambitions, you 
are putting him at loggerheads with Yeltsin? 
  [Chubays] Well, first the word accusing is inappropriate 
here. I think that... 
  [Kiselev interrupts] You did make an accusation. 
  [Chubays] What do you mean? It is the right of any 
politician -- and incidentally Boris Nikolayevich has himself 
said many times that he thinks it quite allright for people to 
want to be presidential candidates. 
  [Luzhkov] First, I think that it is quite absurd to talk of 
a 
presidential campaign now when we have a living president, a 
president who is working energetically. It is absolute 
nonsense. We need to deal with the economy now. That is the 
main thing for the Russian state today. And I would also like 
to say secondly -- and this is perhaps a lot more important from 
the personal point of view -- I have no intention of putting 
myself forward for high- ranking posts. I have no far-reaching 
aims. I have already stated many times that my main and only 
aim is to work in Moscow, for Moscow, and for the people of 
Moscow. And I do not want to go anywhere, I do not want to go 
anywhere. I want to do something decent if I can for this city, 
for my city. 
  [Kiselev] In your view, does Mr. Chubays have some kind of 
political ambitions in this dispute with you? 
  [Luzhkov] Of course he does. You know, when the person in 
charge of a system has failed in his work, he has to find 
explanations for society or he has to find a scapegoat to blame 
and point the finger at him as the guilty party. 
  [Kiselev] This is the last question that I want to ask you 
today, Anatoliy Borisovich. You recently appeared on the 
"Details" program on the second channel and complained that our 
journalists are often not critical enough of Yuriy Mikhailovich 
Luzhkov, that they are afraid of the mayor of Moscow. Do you 
not think that the existing practice of placing paid 
advertisements in the Russian mass media, in the newspapers and 
on television -- in which a great deal of money is invested -- 
actually restricts the freedom of Russian journalists to 
criticize Chubays and the privatization program? 
  [Chubays] You know, I'm sorry but I cannot agree with you 
that people are stopping journalists criticizing me personally 
or the privatization program. I can compete with anyone on the 
number of critical remarks tossed in my direction, which I have 
actually received. And as concerns the funds which we spend on 
propaganda and on information about privatization, I think we do 
very little on this. I am convinced of this and this is one of 
the areas we still need to work on. We have not given people 
enough explanations of the nature, meaning, or aims of the 
program. That is the absolute truth. And when the funds which 
we spend on privatization and informing people meet their aims 
we are sincerely pleased about this. 
  [Kiselev] But there is an important detail here which is not 
widely known by the public. This money is not, in the main, 
Russian, it comes from America. The money was allocated by an 
American agency, a government agency for international 
development, for privatization advertisements among other 
things. Do you not think we have a paradoxical picture here -- 
American taxpayers' money is being spent more or less on 
investment in the Russian mass media to support certain economic 
and political programs? 
  [Chubays] You only need to go one step further to accuse 
Chubays of having been bought out by the CIA. [words indistinct 
due to Chubays and Kiselev talking over one another] Let us not 
look at this with stereotypes from the 1930's but in a common 
sense manner. Some of the funds for information and propaganda 
about privatization actually do come from Russian money, some of 
the funds come from international aid to Russia. Moreover, I 
can tell you that we intend to continue to be active in this 
sphere. We will gladly accept support from the world community 
for Russian privatization, especially when it is a matter of 
free investment from various organizations. I will therefore 
give an unequivocal answer to your question. Yes, of course we 
have used them and will use them, and my view is that these 
funds should be put to even greater use. It would be wasteful 
to refuse these funds and try to squeeze additional resources 
for information on privatization from our budget, which is not 
very generous anyway.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Isakov under the "Parliamentary Diary" </F>
rubric: "Chubays' Grandmother (Article One)"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Devoted to the End of Voucher Privatization... </H5>
  A restaurant was opened on the Arbat recently. There was the 
usual noise, fuss, shouting, and free refreshments. Frenzied 
crowds of people -- it was nearly a job for the mounted police. 
A launch! 
  Privatization itself, unlike an individual restaurant, 
entered our lives quietly and unnoticed. Three versions of the 
law on privatization were submitted for discussion. The Supreme 
Soviet voted for the draft submitted by S. Krasavchenko -- the 
then chairman of the committee for economic reform and 
ownership. And that was that -- no noise, no shouting, no 
applause. The big launches started later. 
  Was a blueprint for privatization in Russia formulated? I 
can testify that it was, I have kept in my archives a copy that 
was prepared for the press. But Krasavchenko himself persuaded 
the leadership that wide public discussion would be detrimental 
to the cause, so the "blueprint" never saw the light of day. 
Russia was pushed into privatization without a rudder, without 
sails, and blindfold. 
  The privatization check -- the voucher -- made an even more 
modest and unassuming entrance. When parliament was on its 
summer recess, the president brought forth the voucher by means 
of a presidential edict, dispatching to oblivion the Law "On 
Nominal Privatization Accounts and Investments." The deputies, 
on returning from their vacations, naturally made a fuss, got 
indignant, and instigated an investigation. But it was too late 
-- the voucher privatization machinery had already begun to turn. 
  This summer the voucher celebrates its birthday -- it is two 
years old. Its time is up, voucher privatization is ending, and 
monetary privatization is beginning. A good time to sum up the 
results and survey the prospects. 
<H5>  Fond Memories of the Central Statistical Administration... </H5>
  The results, in brief, are as follows. By 1 January 1994 
88,577 enterprises had been privatized, or 56.5 percent of 
autonomous enterprises. The proportion of privatized 
enterprises in ferrous metallurgy and chemical and petrochemical 
industry was in excess of 50 percent, in light industry -- 98 
percent, and in trade -- 70 percent. Of 71 million people 
employed in the national economy, 29.5 million work in the 
nonstate sector of the economy. 
  Mr. Chubays and some of his supporters draw a hasty 
conclusion from these figures: Privatization has taken place in 
Russia and its results are irreversible. And the formal 
quantitative results appear to confirm this. But the situation 
is by no means so unequivocal, if you look at how ownership 
"works" and what proportion of the volume of industrial 
production it accounts for (Table 1). 
  As you can see, the real results of privatization are by no 
means as impressive as "Messrs. Privatizers" would wish. State 
enterprises still hold a leading position in the economy, and it 
is they that produce the vast bulk of gross domestic product.

  Privatization and capitalization have produced lamentable 
results in the agrarian sector of the economy. Here are some 
results of economic activity in the countryside by enterprises 
under various forms of ownership -- Table 2. 
  [In the following table, column A represents "Number of 
farms 
(thousands)"; column B: "Gross output (billion rubles)"; column 
C: "Proportion of production (percentage)"; and column D: 
"Proportion of land occupied"]

  One can add to this sorry picture the fact that the 
intolerable conditions, lack of equipment, and the authorities' 
indifference and complacency have resulted in the mass collapse 
of private [fermerskikh] farms: 5,000 in 1992, 14,000 in 
1994.... 
  The only sphere in which privatization can be considered 
more 
or less to have worked is the trade sphere and retailing. You 
can see from Table 3 what the proportion of various forms of 
trade looks like in terms of the total volume of trade turnover.

  Those are the basic economic "parameters" of privatization. 
As you can see, neither fundamental changes in ownership 
relations nor major structural changes have yet taken place. 
Nor have new incentives to labor emerged. That is why it has 
not been possible to halt the decline in production, which in 
recent months has become disastrous. But what does 
privatization look like in its "social aspect"? What are its 
social parameters? Have the "architects of privatization" 
achieved the much-publicized goals enshrined in the 
privatization program? 
<H5>  "Formation of a Class of Private Property-Owners..." </H5>
  The formation of a class of private property-owners was seen 
in the privatization program as the main priority objective of 
reform and the guarantee of its irreversibility. According to 
the country's chief "privatizer," A. Chubays, this task has been 
successfully resolved. "Nobody has disputed, not even our 
fiercest opponents, that there are at least 40 million private 
property-owners in Russia today," he stated proudly at the 
parliamentary hearings in the State Duma. Is it really 40 
million? Nearly one-third of the country's population and 
almost half its working citizens! Where do these figures come 
from? 
  On closer examination it emerges that all those who have 
taken part in the process of conversion to share ownership are 
classed as "private property-owners." If you have just one 
share you are a property-owner, a capitalist, an active 
supporter and champion of "market reforms." 
  But that, if you will forgive me, is...cheating. The facts 
about the rapidly progressing property stratification of Russian 
society are well known. According to State Committee for 
Statistics reports, in January 1994 52.6 million people were 
living below the minimum survival wage level and 26.3 million 
below the poverty line. (Incidentally, the government 
immediately "drew its conclusions": The State Committee for 
Statistics was given a dressing down, and by February the 
unseemly picture had changed strikingly: The number of those 
below the minimum survival wage level had fallen to 24.8 million 
and those below the poverty line to 8.5 million. What success 
-- and for virtually no effort!) 
  The country's internal market is shrinking rapidly. 
Television sets, refrigerators, and sophisticated household 
equipment is gathering dust in the warehouses -- not because 
people do not want to buy them. They would be happy to buy 
them! They would snap them up! But they do not have the money. 
Consumption of basic food products has fallen below all limits, 
by virtually 50 percent. 
  The Chubays privatization has not created, but destroyed, 
the 
middle class -- the natural bulwark of democracy, ownership, the 
rule-of-law state, and the centrist policy. Cultural figures 
(with the exception of those who serve the regime), doctors, 
teachers, scientists, and workers and employees at state 
enterprises have sunk into an abyss of poverty. The Chubays 
privatization has not created, but destroyed, the 
property-owner. The role of the rank-and-file share-owner in 
the management of production is even less today than at the 
earlier "socialist" enterprise. The distance between the worker 
and the product of his labor has not lessened, but increased. 
  The famous "grandmother" for whom Chubays shows such 
touching 
concern has certainly discovered what a "dividend" is -- the 
word is on everyone's lips. What a great discovery! Why should 
she have known, before, that 3 percent annual interest on her 
savings bank investment was a dividend too? But how was she, an 
old woman, supposed to guess, when she went off to vote for 
Yeltsin and Chubays, that they would deceive her so shamelessly? 
  The predatory privatization casts an entirely different 
light 
on the universally slandered and despised Soviet "bureaucrat" -- 
the manager. Why? As a rule he knew his job, he was afraid of 
the boss, and he strove to forge a career. He received a wage 
"no higher than the wage of a skilled worker" and he took bribes 
in moderation (if at all). Nowadays they know nothing, do 
nothing, and are afraid of nobody. I say nothing about bribes. 
  Despite the dense curtain of lies and "market" demagoguery, 
it is gradually getting through to people that they were robbed. 
True, under socialism they were not called "shareholders," but 
everyone, if you think about it, was a share-owner in that giant 
enterprise called the "Soviet Union." Everyone received a 
guaranteed wage of not less than the minimum established by the 
state, he was guaranteed free education, health care, travel 
passes, benefits.... Just imagine for a moment that back then, 
"under stagnation," an entire enterprise's wages had been held 
back for three or four months. 
  Unfortunately, our giant enterprise was not always well 
managed and it lost out in the worldwide competition with the 
West in the sphere of technical progress. Infringements of 
human rights occurred in it, and the press trumpeted them across 
the world. Today it is silent. Because you could hardly find 
another country where human rights are infringed the way they 
are in Russia today. 
  In order to rectify matters, it was certainly not necessary 
to knock the "enterprise" down to its foundations and leave it 
to the four winds. First of all the traitors and sons of 
bitches wrecked the Soviet Union, contrary to the people's will, 
and now, like squirrels, they are dragging into their holes 
whatever remains from the wreckage. The onlookers who were 
present were rewarded with a piece of paper -- the voucher -- so 
as to maintain as long as possible the illusion that in the 
shareout of the stolen goods, you too will receive some little 
crumb.
