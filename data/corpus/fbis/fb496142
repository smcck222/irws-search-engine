<F P=106> [Viktor Khamrayev report under the "Revelations" rubric: </F>
"Grigoriy Yavlinskiy Analyzes Reforms Failures. In His Opinion, 
`Further Reforms Are Only Possible From Below' in Russia"] 
  [Text] Grigoriy Yavlinskiy gives Russia another three to 
four years to make the final choice: Either it is a civil 
society working for its own benefit in an economy suited for it, 
or it is a "super-monopolized economy serving only a mafia-like 
government." Today, the leader of the "Yabloko" Duma faction 
stated at a meeting with students and teachers of Moscow State 
University, "The threat of the second option is great." 
  Mr. Yavlinskiy sees the reasons for that in our "most unique 
system formed over the recent 80 years" -- it has manifested a 
"staggering capacity for reproduction." The uniqueness of this 
system, according to Yavlinskiy, lies in that it was conceived 
as a super-monopoly and "was supposed to work without money, 
whereby it placed itself outside the law and therefore was 
sustained by connections, injunctions, and intimidation." "We 
have made the main error," the author of the "500-Days" concept 
went on to analyze the reform effort, "by freeing this 
essentially mafia-like system, whereas it was society that had 
to be freed from it." 
  The possibilities of "reforms from the top," Mr. Yavlinskiy 
pledged, have become limited to "a feeble liberalization of 
prices and decentralization of their control." In unison with 
the voucher privatization liked "only by those who got their 
checks for free," these measures have helped the old system take 
on a new form. Now it "is seeking to strike its own internal 
balance," in order to preserve unaltered the new situation, 
"unique in world experience," which provides a material and 
technical base for the mafia's final accession to power. "I did 
not realize this at once," admitted Mr. Yavlinskiy, "but if 
neither the president nor the government do not think it 
necessary to talk about a program of further reforms, only one 
conclusion suggests itself: No programs are needed, all reforms 
have already been carried through." 
  Further reforms, in the view of "Yabloko's" creator, are 
possible only "from below." To enable them, Russia would need, 
for the next five to seven years, "a professional, competent, 
not self-centered government which, having sensed the needs of 
society, would stop interfering in its work." The financial 
support for the new stage of reforms, Mr. Yavlinskiy thinks, can 
only be the dollars that Russian businessmen have transferred 
abroad: "Conditions should be created so that businessmen would 
start bringing back their accumulations with no fear or 
misgiving." 
  Grigoriy Yavlinskiy spoke against early presidential 
elections and vouched that he would run for the presidency only 
if there are going to be "lawful elections rather than 
mafia-like shoot-outs."

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Yegorov, president of the Association </F>
of Russian Banks, by Yelizaveta Volgina: "Competition in the 
Banking Sphere Must be Sensible"] 
  [Text] A great deal has been said about foreign banks' 
penetration of the Russian market. The arguments for and 
against are well known. Only the circumstances and the mood 
among state officials change. Despite the Russian Federation 
president's edict restricting foreign banks' activities in 
Russia until 1996, the Central Bank leadership is making its own 
plans: To start issuing licences to foreigners this very June. 
Russian bankers are protesting... Sergey Yegorov, president of 
the Association of Russian Banks, gives his account. 
  [Volgina] Sergey Yefimovich, one of the most awkward 
questions for Russian bankers at the moment is the penetration 
of of our market by foreign banks with their potential. You 
used to take a negative view of foreign capital coming into 
Russia. What is your view of this problem today? 
  [Yegorov] In principle the Association of Russian Banks is 
in favor of foreign investments and foreign banks in Russia. We 
would not want foreign banks to be barred from the Russian 
economy and banking system forever. But we believe that the 
influence of foreign capital should be temporarily restricted, 
so that we are not prevented from establishing our own banking 
system. This is a very important point, because economic 
reforms are simply impossible without a well organized national 
banking system. This system is a key component of the market 
reforms. The creation of it is a very painstaking task, which 
no one is going to do for us, no foreign states, no foreign 
banks. If we look at it from the viewpoint of the state, the 
question now is as follows: Do we need a national banking 
system and what does that entail? 
  [Volgina] And what is the answer to this question? 
  [Yegorov] It is necessary and it is being actively created. 
But we must look at the question from the other angle: How 
important is international banking practice to us and how active 
should we be in encouraging the establishment of foreign banks 
in the Russian economy. We must also bear in mind the fact that 
since our banking system is just finding its feet at the moment 
and is not yet ready for serious competition, what we have to 
create first is favorable conditions for national banks. Even a 
country like Spain, a country with a developed market economy, 
let foreign banks into its economy only recently -- two years 
ago. Hitherto it has been extremely difficult to open a foreign 
bank in Japan. All countries try to protect national interests. 
So we must use -- wisely, of course -- a system of 
protectionism, bearing in mind that all sectors of the national 
economy must be under state tutelage. In particular, such a 
delicate instrument as the banking system. 
  [Volgina] In what way is foreign banks' active penetration 
of the economy damngerous? 
  [Yegorov] Money is an instrument with which you can command 
an entire economy. The entire capital of our young banks may be 
smaller than the capital of some foreign bank... It is 
perfectly clear that our banks will be taking up the rear and 
will be unable to compete in equal terms with foreigners. 
  [Volgina] But it is competition that should be the basis of 
all banking... 
  [Yegorov] Yes, but it must be sensible. Now is not the time 
to give foreign banks extensive access to the Russian economy. 
It is not a matter of fear. It is a real awareness of the 
situation that prevails in the banking sphere. Therefore the 
president issued an edict stating that the issuing of licences 
to engage in banking activities in the Russian economy must be 
delayed for a while -- until 1 January 1996. This edict is 
absolutely correct. It enables us to grow stronger, to equip 
ourselves, and to train staff. Then we will be ready to compete 
with foreign banks. Remember Solzhenitsyn's "The Calf and the 
Oak Tree"? Well, foreign banks are an oak tree we could break 
our horns on.

<F P=106> [Interview with Doctor of Economic Sciences, Professor </F>
Nikolay Shmelev by unnamed ITAR-TASS Correspondent: 
"Treasury-Funded Enterprises -- A Means of Softening the Blow" 
-- first paragraph is introduction] 
  [Text] The Russian President's recent edicts remain a 
topic for discussion among economists and politicians. Your 
ITAR-TASS correspondent met with Doctor of Economic Sciences, 
Professor Nikolay Shmelev. 
  [Correspondent] What is your assessment of the package of 
"economic" edicts that the president has signed? 
  [Shmelev] I do not know about the "mini economic revolution" 
that some newspapers have been talking about, but the very fact 
that these edicts have appeared attests to the desire of the 
country's leadership to move forward and not merely stand still. 
  Take taxation policy, for example. Perhaps I am 
oversimplifying things but for a long time I have wondered why 
our leadership just cannot understand that the lower a tax is, 
the higher the tax yield to the treasury is, and not vice versa? 
But our age-old tradition is to live by "jacking up prices" 
rather than by increasing turnover, a practice which we did not 
change in the period of liberalization. Let us recall, for 
example, the fuss that the first congress of people's deputies 
made about the progressive tax on personal incomes but the 
result was that if you earned just slightly more than a nurse 
there was no point in working, you had to resort to theft... 
Gaydar introduced some incredible taxes, which he justified 
with a single moral argument: I know that this is bad, he said, 
but the budget has to be balanced somehow and the gaps have to 
be plugged: Just as soon as things get a little easier we will 
have a normal taxation system. In our country, however, 
everyone has known for a long time that there are no 
difficulties more permanent than the temporary ones. 
  These edicts seem to reflect the philosophy that President 
Reagan pursued with such success: He cut taxes to a little over 
30 percent, freed investments from tax, and as a result the 
treasury received more than it had done beforehand. If we 
really start to be guided by the same principles -- if we reduce 
the infamous value-added tax, finally exempt investments from 
tax, give tax breaks to new investors, including foreigners, cut 
the rate of profits tax, and so forth -- the situation will be 
encouraging. 
  In the final analysis there is a political interest to all 
this. Just look at the pressure from taxation in Russia on 
industrial enterprises and on private business, in particular. 
The tax system drives private initiative out onto the street, 
into "back alleys," into street stalls, or at best into 
commercial banks -- fine, just so long as that doesn't mean into 
mafia structures. There are not many people who want to engage 
in the business of production because that is known to be a 
loss-making venture. And if we are finally beginning to 
overcome this tendency, it means there is the likelihood that 
the Russian economy will become more efficient. Second, even 
though there is a certain naivety in these documents -- they 
contain all sorts of fines and penalties for nonpayment and so 
forth -- an attempt by the state to take control of the tax 
sphere can only be welcomed. 
  [Correspondent] But how do you regard the idea of creating a 
new category of production units in state ownership -- the 
so-called "treasury-funded [kazennyy] enterprises"? 
  [Shmelev] In principle this is a good attempt to begin the 
scrapping of production units that are not viable by means of 
direct adinistrative pressure on them. We have not yet made up 
our minds to resort to the normal and natural market method of 
bankruptcy even though it is clear that in the end we cannot 
avoid this. But you can understand this indecision. It is due 
to the fear of unemployment, the next social catastrophe after 
the confiscation of savings and the fall in the living standard. 
"Treasury-funded enterprises" are the means whereby we hope to 
soften the blow. 
  [Correspondent] What about the edict on abolishing export 
licenses and quotas? 
  [Shmelev] I know that some businessmen do not see this as a 
particular improvement because the export sales outlets have 
still been carved up by monopolists. Nevertheless, we should 
consider the fact that Russia is still virtually the only 
country in the world which pursued the absurd policy of curbing 
its own exports. Not encouraging them, but curbing them! 
  Of course, there were objective reasons for that, the main 
one being that domestic prices, primarily for raw materials, lag 
behind world prices. Now prices are evening out and the 
potential for making a fortune through export speculation is 
being nullified. Another reason is the massive exodus of capital 
abroad. Nevertheless, restrictions on the export of 
non-strategic goods, not MiG's or nuclear technologies but the 
most ordinary goods, is the height of absurdity. The fact that 
we are doing away with it, that we are moving in our economic 
philosophy away from the absurd ("Beware! They Are Selling 
Russia Off!") toward common sense is an undoubted blessing.

<F P=106> [Yelena Berezneva report: "Private Storehouse in </F>
Motherland's Granaries. `Roskhleboprodukt' Promises Impending 
Drastic Rise in Price of Bread"] 
  [Text] The statement by Leonid Cheshinskiy, president of 
the "Roskhleboprodukt" Joint-Stock Company, came like a bolt out 
of the blue. It concerned Russia's granaries, which are 
allegedly empty. Grain reception enterprises, according to 
Cheshinskiy's rumors, have already bought all the Russian 
peasants' grain surpluses at the former extremely low price of 
90,000 rubles [R] a tonne on average. Wheat from state 
resources is now being used. And since it costs R200,000 a 
tonne owing to spending on storage, transport cost, and "jacked 
up" interest rates, you can expect a rise in the price of your 
daily bread. 
  Arkadiy Gurevich, director of the "Roskhleboprodukt" 
Joint-Stock Company's Market Conditions and Pricing 
Analytical-Information Center, confirmed the planned rise by the 
end of the year in the price of Russians' basic food -- to at 
least 1,000 RUBLES A LOAF. He based this sorry idea on the fact 
that prices of fuel and energy resources are "rocketing" in turn 
as a result of which reception, cleaning, and drying of grain 
are more costly. Plus storage costs.... 
  But, according to Gurevich, the Ministry of Agriculture is 
still taking on a great deal. When he made his statement 
Cheshinskiy was evidently taking into consideration the fact 
that the ministry had informed agrarian specialists at local 
level of so-called advised rough prices for harvest 1994 grain. 
And these guidelines are over twice as much as last year's. 
For instance, peasants will be demanding R220,000-250,000 per 
tonne of food wheat. Insofar as beginning this coming fall, 
grain that is more costly from the outset will be coming in for 
processing, "Roskhleboprodukt" considers it its duty to prepare 
Russia for the new prices of the finished bread. 
  This stance on the part of "Roskhleboprodukt" leaders has 
caused indignation within the Ministry of Agriculture. People 
there categorically deny giving agricultural enterprises any 
advice about the specific prices of this harvest's grain. 
  What is more, some of the ministry's leading specialists 
view 
Cheshinskiy's move as gross indiscretion on the part of a 
commercial agent who regards a Russian peasant's tractor as a 
free ride. They think that grain farmers will naturally sell 
the new harvest's grain at a higher price than in previous 
years. But Cheshinskiy intends to give them only a fourth of 
the 1,000-ruble loaf of the future. And that is daylight 
robbery. Incidentally, of this R1,000 the cost of processing 
accounts for at most R100, delivery accounts for another R100, 
and R50 is the trading outlet's share.... Together with the 
cost of the raw material, that is to say the actual grain, the 
above expenditure on bread production totals, according to 
Agriculture Ministry economists' rough estimates, not R1,000 but 
merely R500. And it is clear who will get the other R500 
demanded from the customer and where it will go. I am talking 
about "Roskhleboprodukt," which has a fortune of its own. 
Nothing to do with the state. 
  Many people in the ministry are puzzled as to why this 
commercial and essentially private structure has been accorded 
the function of state buyer for grain procurement. 
"Roskhleboprodukt" is moreover being given the role of 
monopolist agent between the grower and the miller and then the 
customer. Were this and other middlemen to be taken out of the 
picture, Russian foodstuffs, bread included, would be 40 percent 
cheaper. 
  The picture looks strange. Leonid Cheshinskiy hinted that 
the motherland's granaries are already empty. Some other 
sources of information attest that there is nonetheless almost 
18 million tonnes of grain in these granaries -- almost six 
months' supply. Yet the silos and, even more so, the barns out 
in the countryside are brimming with grain, and, being last 
year's grain it is consequently cheap. 
  Why then is "Roskhleboprodukt" scaring us today with the 
thought of tomorrow's prices of our main foodstuff? There is 
the view that the firm wants to get preferential loans from the 
state for the coming procurement campaign without waiting for 
the harvest. 
  In all self-respecting countries grain production and the 
grain question in general is an area of state policy. Apart 
from perhaps present-day Russia where the state has given up the 
"palm" in this business to a commercial structure. But what if 
our motherland's granaries become a private storehouse? Then 
you will really see what prices will do. And do not grumble 
about it.

  [Text] Russia intends to increase its gold production 
substantially in the very near future, says Yevgeniy Bychkov, 
the head of Russia's Committee for Precious Metals and Precious 
Stones. This year the country has increased gold production from 
149.5 to 157 tons. Gold reserves currently amount to 307 tons. 
Of this total 157.2 tons are held by the Committee for Precious 
Metals. The rest is under the jurisdiction of the Central Bank.

  [Text] The Russian Sea Transport Department might soon 
submit to the government a proposal on the introduction of 
strict quotas on the transportation of Russian oil by Russian 
tankers. 
  A spokesman for the department Dmitriy Kokorin said that at 
the end of last month the leadership of the country's only 
tanker fleet Novoship (Novorossiisk) asked the department and 
the State Oil Company Nafta to give priority to Russian tankers 
in transporting export oil. 
  Novoship and the department account the steady decline in 
the 
share of export cargoes transported by Russian tankers to the 
fact that most oil contracts between Russian exporters and 
foreign customers are on FOB (free on board) terms. 
  Under such contracts exporters deliver oil to the port of 
dispatch while the importer is responsible for the rest of the 
transportation. At the moment most Western oil importers are 
using their own tanker fleets while Novoship tankers are 
standing idle. 
  Novoship has 45 tankers with a combined payload of 2.1 
million tons, 16 oil and ore ships with a payload of 1.4 million 
tons and 5 oil and ore ships working for the Russian-Norwegian 
shipping line Novoklav.

<F P=106> [Andrey Ishchenko report: "President Informed That Butcher </F>
and Plumber Are Trading Uranium"] 
  [Text] Usually the reports of the arrest of Russian 
citizens attempting to earn foreign currency from trading in 
radioactive materials arrive from abroad -- from Germany, 
Hungary, or Poland. But it turns out that our own special 
services do not always allow wrongdoers to cross the state 
border freely. As transpired just the other day, back in March. 
Showing exceptional vigilance, staffers from the Russian 
Federation Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS] St. 
Petersburg Directorate's Antiterrorist Service arrested a group 
of people intending to sell more than three kilograms of highly 
enriched uranium dioxide (Yevgeniy Lukin, chief of the St. 
Petersburg FCS Public Relations Directorate, reported that the 
mole fraction of the uranium-235 in the mixture of isotopes was 
90 percent). The FCS believes that this time too the stolen 
uranium-235 was destined for foreign buyers. 
  In February St. Petersburg's counterintelligence officers 
received their first information on the planned deal. In order 
to locate all uranium storage sites and not miss a single gram 
of this strategic raw material, the FCS operatives "played 
along" with the dealers and rounded up all those involved in 
March. They confiscated 3.05 kg of uranium powder, which had 
been stored in a half-liter glass jar and metal flask -- the 
dealers were clearly not too worried about their own health. 
  But that is not the most important point. The fact is that 
until recently most of the "unorganized" traders in radioactive 
material (one of the people arrested turned out to be a butcher, 
another was a plumber) had been trying to sell as strategic raw 
materials radioactive waste, or even real uranium, but minimally 
enriched -- turning it into dangerous bomb material would 
require huge amounts of money and a highly complex production 
process. But this time, if the St. Petersburg FCS directorate's 
information is to be fully believed, we are dealing with real 
weapons-grade raw material. It was stolen "from an enterprise 
near Moscow" (presumably the cities of Bolshevo, Elektrostal, or 
Noginsk -- Ed.). This was where the butcher, the plumber, and 
co. removed three whole kilograms of highly enriched uranium (in 
gloves, they claim) without being stopped. 
  All the arrested men are now in St. Petersburg, where they 
are being interrogated. A case under Article 223 Note 3 (theft 
of radioactive materials) is being brought in the place where 
the crime was committed -- the Moscow area. The president has 
been notified of the incident in a special report. 
<H5>  Instead of Commentary </H5>
  We would recall that last fall our newspaper published the 
results of an investigation which resulted in our journalists, 
posing as buyers of fissionable materials, acquiring 
weapons-grade (highly enriched) plutonium and uranium from 
illegal traders. We had also come across an SS-20 warhead in 
private hands. People tried to refute the results of our 
investigation until the NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA Editorial 
Office received a document from Ministry of Security experts 
fully confirming that our correspondents had indeed obtained 
weapons-grade plutonium. 
  When the RTV program "Eks" broadcast some of the results of 
our work, V. Mikhaylov, minister of atomic energy, issued an 
angry letter through ITAR-TASS categorically denying that it was 
possible to steal uranium and plutonium from the enterprises 
under his jurisdiction. 
  But now there is today's case.... We are not gloating, it is 
simply that in our reports of last year we cited Elektrostal as 
a city where uranium was being filched from a plant in milk cans. 
  The NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA investigative service and 
science department will henceforth be conducting joint 
investigations into the ways in which strategic materials and 
nuclear weapons are being lost. We would recall that there are 
two days to go until subscription closes.

<F P=106> [Oleg Volkov article under "Government Debts" rubric: "It </F>
Seems That the Atom Is Ceasing To Be Peaceful"] 
  [Text] Representatives of the nuclear power industry 
workers' trade union are preparing to participate today in the 
"Rosenergoatom" concern's traditional monthly conference of 
nuclear electric power station [AES] directors -- they intend to 
ask the leadership bluntly: Either use any means to attempt to 
rescue the sector, or stop kidding people and shut down the 
reactors. 
  The point is that the majority of rank and file turbine and 
reactor operators, engineers, and even cleaners at the nine 
Russian AES's have already forgotten what regular wage 
statements look like, and do not intend "to put up with this 
appalling situation any longer." The ordinary nuclear power 
industry workers have no one left on whom they can depend: The 
many months of maneuvering by the "Rosenergoatom" president, his 
deputies, and the AES directors in Russia's vast corridors of 
power, the entreaties to the government, and the undisguised 
threats to abandon all work on improving the reactors' safety 
systems -- all this did not change the situation in the sector 
as a whole. The indebtedness of the main consumer of the 
electric power generated by the AES's, the "YeES Rossii" Russian 
joint-stock company, has doubled since the beginning of the year 
and stood at 650 billion rubles [R] 1 June. It's a long time 
since nuclear power workers gave a thought to profit: They 
would just like to survive and pay off their own debts (for 
fuel, new equipment, construction, and repairs -- amounting to 
R574 billion). So as to at least stay afloat, the AES directors 
have been forced to economize on everything, but even this is 
not saving them. Only a handful of fuel assemblies and spare 
parts for planned repairs remain, and at several power stations 
it is time to enlist psychotherapists en masse to calm down the 
seething work force. 
  Just recently the union of nuclear power engineering and 
nuclear power industry workers had completely peaceful 
inclinations: There was the good-natured picket at the White 
House, the calm talks with the government and at the Duma, the 
not too insistent requests to the new deputies to be, to put it 
mildly, more attentive to the AES's -- the reactors, they said, 
don't burn wood. (The only exception was the Bilibino AES in 
Chukotka, where several power station workers staged a protest 
hunger strike and threatened, in contravention of the law on 
resolving labor conflicts, to go on strike.) 
  However, after the latest high-level document -- on this 
occasion a report on the proceedings of a conference on 
normalizing the situation in the sector hosted by First Vice 
Premier Oleg Soskovets -- proved not to be worth the paper it 
was printed on, the trade union decided to reject any form of 
subordination. Now for the most important question: Will the 
directors succeed in maintaining strict discipline at the power 
stations in the coming months? (And it is so surprising how, in 
a constantly nerve-racking situation, the AES's have managed to 
get through six months without any serious emergencies?) 
  The union recently sent a letter to the State Duma 
containing 
a proposal to immediately appropriate R574 billion to cover AES 
debts or to reach a decision to close all the stations down, 
paying for all expenditure on the reactors' shutdown, cooling, 
and unloading, as well as on maintaining them in a safe 
condition for the next five years. (The nuclear power workers 
calculate that this will run up a bill of more than a trillion 
rubles). The nuclear power workers would, of course, like to 
avoid the latter option, as well, incidentally, as "vigorous 
actions" in the event their demands are ignored yet again. By 
law, nuclear power workers cannot strike at all, but Vladimir 
Koshkin, deputy chairman of the trade union's central committee, 
stated yesterday in a telephone interview for your NOVAYA 
YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA correspondent that AES workers are 
"prepared for any form of protest." So on this occasion it is 
possible that the situation will end not only in group hunger 
strikes -- and then the government will not get away with 
handing out crumbs.

  [Text] North Ossetia -- A meeting has taken place in 
Vladikavkaz between republic President Akhsarbek Galazov, 
parliament head Yuriy Biragov, and Provisional Administration 
chief Vladimir Lozovoy. The focus of attention was on matters 
related to the rehabilitation of housing and communications 
destroyed in the course of the tragic events of October and 
November 1992, as well as socioeconomic problems in the state of 
emergency zone. Also taking part in the discussion were members 
of the government and parliament of North Ossetia, as well as 
representatives of federal ministries and departments on a 
fact-finding mission in North Ossetia and Ingushetia. 
  According to Vladimir Lozovoy, a large group of Russian 
Federation ministry and department chiefs arrived in the 
conflict zone to organize preparation for the return of refugees 
and forced resettlers to four populated areas in Prigorodnyy 
Rayon, in line with the Russian Federation president's 30 May 
1994 edict On Introducing a State of Emergency in Parts of the 
Territory of North Ossetia and Ingushetia. The meeting 
pinpointed the main lines of activity by the republic leadership 
toward adjusting the situation. North Ossetia is ready to 
implement the Russian president's edict and a corresponding 
resolution by the Russian Federation Government, but the refugee 
problem should be resolved in a comprehensive manner, on the 
basis of the agreements signed in Kislovodsk. A decisive say 
here belongs to conciliation commissions that were set up in all 
populated areas of Prigorodnyy Rayon. Their activity is already 
yielding some results. Thus, residents in the village of 
Kurtat at their meeting ruled that six Ingushi families return 
to their former homes, specifying them by name.

  [Text] Moscow June 8 TASS -- The forum of public 
organisations of the people of northern Caucasus and Cossack 
troops from Russia's south is prepared to take tough and 
efficient measures if six Ingush hostages earlier detained in 
North Ossetia are not released until June 10. 
  An appeal to the North Ossetian president, which came to 
ITAR-TASS from the Ingush permanent mission in Russia today, 
says that if the hostages are held any longer, the forum of 
public organisations reserves the right to hold up traffic from 
North Ossetia to the territories of the Stavropol, Kuban and the 
Don region as of June 11. Other protest actions and sanctions 
will be taken in future, the appeal said. 
  Representatives of the north Caucasian people and Cossack 
troops from Russia's south come out for strict implementation of 
the Russian president's decree of May 30, 1994, including in 
part concerning the immediate release of hostages, the appeal 
said.

<F P=106> [Interview with V.N. Likhachev, vice president of the </F>
Republic of Tatarstan, by Shamil Khammatov, date and place not 
given: "Visit of Serious Intentions"] 
  [Text] TATAR-INFORM's special correspondent met with V. 
Likhachev, vice president of the Republic of Tatarstan, and 
asked him to comment on the results of the visit to Tatarstan by 
B.N. Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation. 
  [Khammatov] Vasiliy Nikolayevich, I think that you can 
assess the Russian President's visit not only as a politician 
but also as a major specialist in the field of international law 
and a doctor of legal sciences. In this connection, what 
comment can you make on Boris Nikolayevich's visit to our 
republic in terms of its international significance? 
  [Likhachev] This visit is of interest to the international 
public in the sense that it confirms the very serious intentions 
of the two sides to reform Russia on the new democratic 
principles of a true federation. I believe that the Russian 
president came here not for a purely protocol visit so as to 
shake hands with the leadership of Tatarstan but in order to 
emphasize the consistency of his course and his readiness to 
abide by international standards, in particular the generally 
acknowledged right of the peoples to self-determination. 
  In 1990, B.N. Yeltsin said: "Take as much sovereignty as you 
can." In 1994 he signed a treaty with Tatarstan and I, as a 
direct participant in that signing, can confirm that there would 
not have been a treaty had it not been the will of the Russian 
president himself, who overcame resistance to it even within his 
own entourage. Yeltsin acted not just as a strong-willed figure 
but also as one characterized by political pragmatism. 
  Finally, the Russian President's visit to our country gave a 
powerful impetus to the implementation of the treaty between 
Russia and Tatarstan on the demarcation of terms of reference 
and the mutual delegation of powers. By this visit and the 
accord with Tatarstan, Boris Nikolayevich was displaying his 
democratic image to the public of Russia, the CIS, and 
undoubtedly the rest of the world. New models of mutual 
relations were refined and, in particular, support was given to 
the idea expressed by Tatarstan President M.Sh. Shaymiyev back 
at the beginning of this year on the decentralization of the 
administration of Russia -- decentralization in the sense of 
ensuring a balance of the interests of the center and the 
regions, not in the sense of anarchy, disorder, and destruction. 
  [Khammatov] Vasiliy Nikolayevich, I believe that I am right 
in saying that during the visit there was a fruitful discussion 
of questions connected with the life of the diaspora and with 
the spiritual and cultural development of the peoples of Russia 
and Tatarstan in general. 
  [Likhachev] Yes, I was very pleased that the Russian 
president firmly supported the implementation of questions of 
aid for the Tatar diaspora, important domestic and foreign 
policy questions as far as we are concerned. The discussion 
centered on the idea that Kazan should become a real coordinator 
of all Russian policy regarding the diaspora. A coordinator in 
the best and most positive sense. It is important to stress 
this so that the leaders do not think that Shaymiyev is going to 
phone up every day to ask how the Tatars are getting on over 
there, whether they have been provided with housing, work, and 
so on. It is important that it is by the joint efforts of all 
the regions of Russia, and I repeat the word "all," that an 
intellectual, methodological, scientific, and financial center 
is created to give the Tatar diaspora help because what we are 
talking about here is the second largest nation in Russia. 
Because in essence the work which is being carried out is 
currently reliant on our internal resources. And today, on the 
eve of the 21st century, when it is not only general human 
values which are being developed in a new way but when our own 
national culture and national languages are to be developed, the 
vectors of these will be the vehicles of world civilization. 
  The path to world civilization runs through national 
cultures 
and the national perception of life. There must be coordinated 
joint efforts to realize the idea of the smooth and civilized 
integration of Tatarstan and Russia into the spiritual and 
cultural world community. It is very important, the relevant 
documents have been prepared on the initiative of the 
presidents, and Boris Nikolayevich gave the corresponding 
instructions to a number of ministers, to O.N. Soskovets 
directly, to implement this plan. During this visit the Russian 
president spoke on behalf of all Russians as a man who has a 
fine appreciation of the psychological side of the country's 
life. Incidentally, in the near future I am due to have talks 
with Russian Federation ministers Kozyrev, Sidorov, and Yegorov 
on the implementation of these ideas and on their translation 
into the language of concrete edicts and directives of the 
Russian president and government. 
  [Khammatov] Does that also include the implementation of 
your idea on the creation of a children's folk art center in 
Kazan under the auspices of UNESCO and the Russian and Tatarstan 
presidents? 
  [Likhachev] Yes, this idea received the presidents' support. 
Children are the source of the spiritual rebirth of Russia and 
Tatarstan and of all the nations which inhabit their 
territories. And I think that we will be able to set an example 
of a state approach in the education of the rising generation, 
who are the future of both Tatarstan and Russia.

<F P=106> [Yadviga Yuferova report: "Moscow: It Is Dangerous to Life </F>
Not To Fight for Life"] 
  [Text] The capital's government has approved the program 
"Moscow Safety." Not that much money has so far been allocated 
to implementing it over the next two years -- 2.6 billion 
rubles. The program's scientific and technical council is 
headed by B. Nikolskiy, first deputy mayor of Moscow. 
  The last time the piercing alarm sirens were sounded in 
Moscow was more than half a century ago, signaling enemy air 
raids. Today there are over 800 of these devices located 
throughout the city -- may fate spare every one of us from 
hearing that alarm. 
  Leading scientists and practical experts headed by N. 
Makhutov, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences, have spent more than six months substantiating 
possible actions in emergency situations: First, what to do 
when it has all happened and, second, what to do to prevent a 
tragedy. 
  The program is of a scientific-organizational nature. Its 
purpose is to "reduce the risk of emergency situations, lessen 
their consequences, ensure efficient actions to eliminate them, 
and create conditions for accident-free work at industrial 
enterprises and municipal service installations." 
  Given our talent for closing the stable door after the horse 
has bolted, this is a serious psychological step. Having cast 
off the decrepit clothes of the old principles of civil defense, 
society must work out and inwardly adopt the principles of 
mutual collective safety. Because not only malicious but also 
negligent actions by just one person can pose a threat to the 
lives of millions of people, and so man-made [tekhnogennyy] 
accidents come to the fore in terms of the gravity of their 
consequences. 
  In Moscow today there are 66 dangerous installations, but do 
not think that the nine nuclear reactors head this list. 
Extremely toxic poisons (ETP's, as the professionals say) are 
concentrated at food enterprises, cold combines, and 
water-purification stations. The scientific and technical 
program provides for a search for new coolants and a strict 
regime for servicing those workplaces where it used to be hard 
to find a sober fitter. The government also expects from the 
specialists a substantiated list of particularly harmful 
production processes which it would be less painful to close 
down than to continue operating. 
  One more important point. Dangerous freight frequently 
passes through Moscow. The program also provides for a system 
to license such transit. 
  Epidemics, explosions, accidents, fires, and natural 
cataclysms, against which it is impossible to insure, demand 
efficient work by all the city's rescue services. A single 
control center will very soon be created for all of Moscow's 
emergency services. It is a pity that today it is still not 
possible to announce this telephone number. 
  In March, in the article "Revolt in Moscow More Terrible 
Than 
Nuclear War," I wrote about the big city's most vulnerable 
spots. In particular, in the capital today there are more than 
8,500 high-rise blocks, but the ladders the firemen have had at 
their disposal reached only to the 16th floor. If something 
were to happen higher up, hope would have to be placed in the 
Highest [as published]. Here is today's comforting news: 
Creation of a helicopter service in Moscow is vigorously under 
way, and in an emergency help will come literally from the sky. 
Also, three extra-length ladders which can reach the 22nd floor 
have been purchased abroad to fight fires in high-rise 
buildings. It would, of course, be better for those who live on 
the 23rd floor not to catch fire.... 
  In 1995, for the first time in the city's history, an annual 
report "On the Safety of the Population" will be submitted to 
the Government of Moscow. 
  The recently deceased writer Ales Adamovich liked to repeat: 
Only one person can save the world, and that person is you.

  [Text] The edict issued by Mikhail Nikolayev, president of 
the Sakha Republic, Yakutia, establishes special rules for entry 
into the republic. They concern citizens of foreign states and 
CIS countries, as well as those republics of the Russian 
Federation which have not signed the federal agreement. To 
enter Yakutia from now on, it is necessary for them to have 
special invitations approved by the local authorities. In a 
number of instances, citizens in given categories could be 
refused permission to enter the republic of Sakha, or be 
expelled before the expiration of their stay. The grounds for 
this specifically are actions which go against the interests of 
state security or public order, established traditions and 
standards of moral behavior, as well as breaches of customs, 
currency, and other laws of the Russian Federation and Yakutia.

<F P=106> [Valeriya Ochinyan report: "Changes in Sverdlovsk Oblast </F>
Administration. Sverdlovsk Governor Gets Rid of `Old Guard'"] 
  [Text] It has taken Sverdlovsk Oblast Governor Aleksey 
Strakhov five months to finally decide on a reshuffle in the 
administration. He announced the move in yesterday's sitting of 
the oblast government. Despite the many expectations, however, 
the fired officials were not the men of former governor Eduard 
Rossel, but rather members of the "old guard" who used to work 
in Sverdlovsk with Boris Yeltsin and Oleg Lobov. 
  The shakeout, the possibility of which Aleksey Strakhov 
warned about back in his first days as governor, has affected 
the positions of importance for the oblast: Having been 
relieved of their positions are Aleksandr Nebesnov, deputy 
administration head for transport and communications; Sergey 
Turunovskiy, administrator of affairs; Anatoliy Tarasov, head of 
the foreign economic relations administration; and Galina 
Ivanina, head of the organizational department. Incidentally, 
Mrs. Ivanina is the only "casualty" whose dismissal was 
explained by the administration's head himself; he accused her 
of "working for the Duma." The cause of Mr. Tarasov's dismissal 
is also clear, however, for he is being identified with the 
abuses by the oblast's special exporters of strategic raw 
materials who were recently exposed by a commission of the 
Control Administration under the president. 
  According to informed sources, so protracted a hiatus 
between 
Mr. Strakhov's appointment as governor and the start of the 
personnel "purges" is attributed to the difficulties of 
selecting personnel to fill key positions in the oblast. One 
can still suppose that the governor will not draw the line at 
parting with the mentioned officials, and the administration is 
in for new waves of dismissals. At the same time, observers 
think, the fired officials cannot be identified at all as 
"Rossel's people" because most of them had been working in the 
oblast [Communist Party] executive committee ever since Boris 
Yeltsin was secretary of the oblast committee, and Oleg Lobov 
chairman of the oblast executive committee. Experts who predict 
Mr. Rossel's comeback as governor think Strakhov's reshuffle 
would stand any of his successors in good stead because 
discernible behind the current change is the desire to replace 
the old-style administrators with younger ones, capable of 
flexible methods of work.

  [Text] Syktyvkar, 9 Jun -- The Komi Government resigned en 
masse on Tuesday [7 June] as Yuriy Spiridonov has taken up the 
post of head of the Republic of Komi, which, under the new 
Constitution, is also head of the government. He will have five 
deputies and it is thought there will be 17 ministries, as well 
as the administration of the head of the Republic of Komi, 
working as a single body ensuring the operation of the 
government he heads. 
  At a session of the republic's Supreme Soviet, Spiridonov 
warned that in his government the number of civil servants would 
be cut back considerably, although the professionals would 
remain on the job. 
  A special parliament resolution passed on Wednesday made 
provision for appropriations for the material-technological and 
financial working of the head of the Republic of Komi, setting 
the salary for the post at 50 times the minimum monthly salary 
set by Russian legislation.

  [Text] Komsomolsk on Amur June 9 TASS -- The primary 
organisation of the Russian National Unity Movement formed in 
Komsomolsk on Amur distributes newspapers and leaflets. The 
organisation is in opposition to both democrats and communists. 
On matters of national policy it holds an even tougher stand 
than the Zhirinovskiy party. The movement's credo is "revival 
of the Russian nation". 
  Members of the local organisation of the Russian National 
Unity Movement strive to enlist support among workers, the 
military and youth. The movement has supporters among Cossacks 
and the local patriotic society RUS. The organisation's leaders 
have contacts with Moscow and receive from Moscow newspapers and 
booklets, specifically "The Russian Order", "Russian World", 
"Our Fatherland". These publications are blatantly 
nationalistic. The authorities of Komsomolsk on Amur try not to 
notice the new organisation that has not been registered 
officially.

  [Text] The Duma passed a federal budget bill for 1994 after 
its second hearing on Wednesday without introducing amendments 
to the planned budget revenue, expenditure, and deficit. A 
total of 227 lawmakers voted for the bill (a quorum requires 
226), 40 voted against, and 32 abstained. 
  The draft of the 1994 federal budget provides for 194.4 
trillion rubles in expenditure and 124.4 trillion rubles in 
revenue with the deficit planned at 70 trillion rubles or 9.6 
percent of the GDP. 
  Legislators approved without debate the Duma Budget 
Committee's proposal to boost defense spending from 37.1 
trillion rubles to 40.6 trillion rubles by redistributing budget 
allocations. The bill also envisages raising additional funds 
for defense and other purposes. 
  Speaking before the vote First Deputy Finance Minister 
Vladimir Petrov declared that his ministry was dropping its 
demand to reserve 1.5 trillion rubles to pay off internal 
currency debts. He said talks will be opened to discuss ways of 
rescheduling the debts repayment to January 1995. 
  Under the law the government must take the Duma's budget 
comments into account and submit the bill for the final third 
hearing within two weeks.

  [Text] [Announcer] The State Duma devoted the whole of 
today to discussing the second reading of the 1994 federal 
budget. Here is our correspondent Aleksey Venediktov. 
  [Venediktov] The passing of the second reading of the budget 
was replete with dramatic situations. The parliamentary speaker 
Ivan Rybkin delayed the opening of the evening session by 42 
minutes and assembled the heads of all the political groupings 
in the presidium room. He proposed adopting all the amendments 
put forward by the budget committee as a single package without 
voting on each one separately. 
  Communist leader Gennadiy Zyuganov demanded that Sergey 
Glazyev should be allowed to speak on one amendment on setting 
up a non-budgetary fund into which would go the money from 
privatization and from which the money would be used for the 
needs of the army. The leader of the Yabloko group, Grigoriy 
Yavlinskiy, stated that if Glazyev was allowed to say anything 
at all, then he would demand that all 275 amendments should be 
voted on separately. As a result of such slight blackmail, all 
the amendments were grouped together for a single vote. 
  [Announcer] The document was then passed by a majority of 
two. 
  [Correspondent Ivan Trefilov] The State Duma's deputies had 
the wisdom to leave unchanged the main figures of the budget 
which were adopted in the first reading. In 1994 expenditure 
will be 194.5 trillion rubles [R] and revenue will be R124.5 
trillion. The budget deficit is fixed at R70 trillion which is 
36 percent of the expenditure section. 
  Thanks to the efforts of the budget committee, some 
corrections have been made within various articles. There has 
been a reduction of R4.5 trillion in expenditure on foreign 
economic activity and a reduction of R1.5 trillion in 
expenditure on servicing the internal debt. The total savings 
amounted to R8.5 trillion. These monies will be used to add 
R3.5 trillion to the defense budget. The subjects of the 
Russian Federation have received just under R3 trillion. The 
rest of the savings has been directed to supporting the social 
and cultural sphere, to scientific and fundamental research and 
to law enforcement activity. Support was also given to the 
proposal of the budget committee to create a special 
non-budgetary fund to support the army. Ivan Trefilov for Ekho 
Moskvy from the State Duma. 
  [Announcer] Those who voted for the budget were primarily 
the 
Communists and Agrarians. In an interview to our correspondent 
[Communist leader] Gennadiy Zyuganov stated: 
  [Begin Zyuganov recording] This is the logic of common 
sense. 
Any government, regardless of its ideology, if it is going to 
operate, will be obliged to tackle these questions regardless of 
what its overall basic views are. Everyone wants to eat, work 
and have social protection and adequate security. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] Parliament's democratic wing came out against 
the 
budget. In an interview with journalists [Yegor] Gaydar, leader 
of Russia's Choice said: 
  [Begin Gaydar recording] I would like to point out that the 
very idea of creating a non-budgetary fund with monies from 
privatization for financing defense is an obvious delusion. The 
budget was one small weakness: It is clearly unrealistic. It is 
clearly out of touch with the possibilities of Russia's economic 
development in 1994. It has many things which are not at all 
correct. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, leader of the Yabloko 
grouping, holds a position which is similar in principle. 
  [Begin Yavlinskiy recording] The voting just now concerned 
the redistribution of 10 percent within the budget. This is not 
a fundamental issue. In those places where, say, 70 percent of 
our amendments were adopted it was somewhat improved, but this 
did not alter the overall situation. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] The budget will now be sent to the Federation 
Council. Nikolay Gonchar, chairman of the Budget Committee of 
the upper chamber, told our correspondent: 
  [Begin Gonchar recording] It has evidently been suggested to 
the leadership of the Federation Council that the Federation 
Council should be convened earlier than planned, that is, 
perhaps, next week because, I believe, the situation is rather 
tense. I think the Federation Council will come under very 
strong pressure and the Federation Council deputies will find 
themselves between the pressure put on them from above and the 
pressure put on them from below. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] However, before the document can be examined by 
the upper chamber it must undergo its third reading. In 
accordance with the law, the government should, within a period 
of two weeks, take account of the observations which the Duma 
made today and, after this, put it forward for the final vote.

  [Text] To begin our news bulletin, we have a report by our 
parliamentary correspondent Yevgeniy Zherebenkov. 
  [Zherebenkov] The State Duma has passed at a second reading 
the draft law on the federal budget for the current year, 
submitted by the government, with account taken of amendments 
added by the Duma's budget committee and the creation of special 
extrabudgetary funds for defense. The draft law was passed by a 
very narrow margin. A number of factions, including Russia's 
Choice and Yabloko, abstained from the vote. This is how 
Russia's Choice leader Yegor Gaydar explained his faction's 
position. 
  [Begin Gaydar recording] Russia's Choice believes that many 
of the budget committee's amendments make sense. Happily they 
included a number of Russia's Choice amendments. At the same 
time, the version submitted still contains a number of items 
that we find categorically unacceptable. 
  We draw attention to the very idea of creating an 
extrabudgetary fund to finance defense at the expense of 
privatization, which is obviously a fraud, because any person 
with common sense knows very well that Russia will not be able 
to obtain this money earmarked for defense out of privatization 
in 1994. 
  We are categorically opposed to the fact that a system of 
transfers that continues to subsidize the south at the expense 
of the north has been retained in the budget. We believe that 
the agreement on managerial expenditure was inadequate. We draw 
attention to the fact that our amendments to cut outlay on 
agriculture, in particular on subsidies and central investments 
and to redistribute expenditure on the needs of education, 
science, and culture were not accepted. 
  That is why the faction decided to abstain. [end recording]

  [Text] The government has no clear budget policy today, 
while the draft budget it has submitted is simply a statement of 
expenses, Federation Council chairman Vladimir Shumeyko told 
journalists today. He believes the draft budget has no purpose. 
Shumeyko compared it to porridge spread thinly on a plate. 
Answering a question about the Federation Council's proposal to 
increase military expenditure, Shumeyko said that this is a 
demand put forward by life itself.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Glazyev, chairman of the State Duma </F>
Committee for Economic Policy: "Everything Is Fine, Beautiful 
Marchioness. Today the Second Readings of the Draft Federal 
Budget for 1994 Begin"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The first version of the 
draft federal budget was submitted to the Federal Assembly 18 
March. [passage omitted] 
  The draft federal budget immediately generated sharp 
criticism in several significant spheres. First of all, 
it was submitted without the necessary accompanying 
documents, the main one of which is a forecast of economic 
and social development for the year and a preliminary report on 
the implementation of the budget in the previous year. 
  Second, the realistic nature of the 
draft federal budget and the forecast based on it 
generated a great deal of doubt. The findings of the Committee 
for Economic Policy noted that attempts to meet the figures for 
the average annual deficit incorporated in the forecasts by 
further squeezing the real money supply could cause a 
continuation in the reduction in production by 25-30 percent as 
compared with last year, which, in its turn, will generate a 
sharp increase in the state budget deficit, and, as a 
consequence, a growth in inflation, whose rate far exceeds the 
forecasted scale. [passage omitted] 
  Third, the question of the correspondence of 
the draft federal budget for 1994 with the priorities 
of the state socioeconomic policy arose. [passage omitted] 
  Fourth, important potential income was not taken into 
account in the draft federal budget. [passage omitted] 
  Fifth, the prevailing practice of forming funds outside 
the budget was subjected to serious criticism; these are 
formed out of quasi-tax payments, but are not taken into account 
in the budget. [passage omitted] 
  Sixth, a lot of contradicting information and basic 
arithmetical mistakes were discovered in the draft budget 
and the attached materials, the form of the presentation of the 
budget makes it impossible to assess allocations for many 
spheres, and the absence of a breakdown of expenditure for 
programs makes funding and supervision of the implementation of 
ratified federal programs difficult. [passage omitted] 
  A large part of the criticism of the budget being adopted 
remained unanswered, and the insignificant changes which the 
government made to the draft did not lead to a fundamental 
improvement. The income, increased by 3,776.5 billion rubles 
[R] and the deficit, by R6.4 trillion, were mainly targeted at 
the needs of agriculture, which increased the disproportions in 
the funding of priority spheres of structural policy even more. 
  Amplifications were not made to the forecast of the 
development of the Russian economy, which was evidently at 
variance with reality. Proceeding from this, the Committee for 
Economic Policy adopted a decision -- to recommend 
that the State Duma should reject the draft Federal 
Law "On the Federal Budget for 1994" given the amendments 
presented by the government 26 April 1994. 
  The majority of deputies disagreed with this proposal and 
voted for the adoption of the budget at the first reading. 
Although practically all factions made a negative assessment of 
the draft federal budget and stated the need for its cardinal 
improvement. Curiously, the opposition parties, which had 
sharply criticized the economic policy which remains unchanged 
under the approved draft federal budget, voted in favor of the 
ratification of the draft federal budget. 
  It is hard to understand the logic of this decision. 
Everyone was hoping for the improvement of the draft federal 
budget during its revision for the second reading, but they were 
deceiving themselves. 
  It is impossible to improve the draft budget 
within the framework of an economic policy conducted on the 
condition of "collective irresponsibility." Behind every entry 
for items of expenditure in the draft federal budget which has 
already been approved at the first reading lie opportunist 
interests which have already proved their supremacy in respect 
of the approach to the national economy. 
  Obviously, it will scarcely prove possible to reduce 
expenditure following the adoption of the draft federal budget 
in the first reading with such an approach toward forming it. 
Consequently, it is only possible to improve the draft budget 
by increasing its income part. And increasing this presupposes, 
first of all, a repeat examination of the draft federal budget 
in the first reading, and, second, the need for a serious change 
in the economic policy being conducted; if only in accordance 
with the directions of the president's message to the Federal 
Assembly, which was supported by the Duma. 
  But that is what the government evidently does not want to 
do. It is no accident that the proposals of the Committee for 
Economic Policy to increase income from the privatization and 
commercial use of state property were given a hostile reception. 
This is a troublesome matter, requiring long and painstaking 
work and the implementation of mechanisms for State Committee 
for the Management of State Property organs to carry 
responsibility for the use of the state assets they have been 
entrusted with controlling, strict accountability for income 
received, and so on. It is far more convenient to continue the 
policy of the uncontrolled pulling apart of state property on 
the pretext of building national capitalism. The program of 
so-called post-voucher privatization is based on the previous 
mechanism of spontaneous privatization "from below," geared to 
privatization for the sake of privatization at the fastest 
possible rate, without taking into consideration the criteria of 
economic efficiency. 
  The same goes for restoring order in the sphere of foreign 
economic activity. Further increasing income by R6.65 trillion 
proves to be a less attractive task than the shady 
redistribution of state income in favor of privileged 
structures. The adoption by the prime minister of new decisions 
on granting privileges in violation of legislation was a kind of 
reaction to the Duma's demand for the revocation of unlawfully 
distributed privileges and the Edict of the President No. 1007 
(once again ordering the government to revoke the unlawful 
privileges). These include privileges for the purchase of 
foreign airplanes (and this in a situation in which domestic 
aircraft builders cannot sell finished airliners amid the acute 
need to renew the fleet of airplanes, and the program for the 
development of civil aircraft is being underfunded), privileges 
on the import of goods for the Goodwill Games in St. Petersburg 
(although usually the organizing parties try to use 
international rivalry to stimulate internal demand), and also 
privileges for the export of oil to Tatarstan (which is in fact 
a subsidy and should be reflected in the distribution of 
transfers in the federal budget). 
  No response has been received to the requests of the 
Committee for Economic Policy that the government should present 
some kind of justification for the privileges that have been 
granted. The same has happened with the inquiries concerning 
the number of shares of privatized enterprises retained in 
federal ownership and the dividends received on them.... 
  The answer the Ministry of Finance gave to the proposals 
made 
by the Committee for Economic Policy to increase budget income 
by revoking unlawful privileges is curious. It rejects this 
proposal because the government has planned to reduce the export 
tariff rate, which will entail a reduction in income under the 
heading of foreign economic activity. Obviously, no 
calculations are cited here. There is no reasonable explanation 
for this latest unplanned change in the income base of the 
budget in the process of its examination, either. The aim of 
such actions is to raise enterprises' income from the export of 
raw materials, which have gone up in price in relative terms as 
a result of the growth in domestic prices, which outstripped the 
fall in the rate of the ruble by 8 percent in the first six 
months of the year. But after all, bringing the dynamics of the 
ruble rate into line with price dynamics is an obvious measure 
in this situation -- the correct policy for the exchange rate 
should actually be geared to settling tasks relating to support 
for the competitiveness of domestic output and stimulating 
exports of it. Instead of this, an obviously damaging decision 
is being adopted -- to reduce the export tariff rate, which will 
lead not only to a significant and unplanned reduction in budget 
income, and consequently, to the underfunding of planned 
expenditure and an ensuing increase in nonpayments, but also to 
the raising of the domestic prices of raw materials. 
Correspondingly, the competitiveness of domestic output will 
continue to fall, the structure of exports to worsen, and its 
volume to decrease, home-produced goods will inevitably be 
squeezed out by imported ones, and domestic production will be 
steadily reduced. The income base of the budget will also 
undoubtedly be reduced. 
  The most surprising thing is that the proposal to reduce 
export tariffs comes from the Ministry of Finance, which, by 
virtue of its functions, should be concerned about increasing 
the income base of the budget. It is paradoxical but true that 
the State Committee for the Management of State Property is 
pursuing a line of spontaneously giving away the property it has 
been entrusted with, without even being interested in the income 
it brings, and the Ministry of Finance is proposing to reduce 
the income part of the budget, and is spending state funds 
without conforming to the economic effectiveness of this 
expenditure. And the government is approving and supporting 
this strange policy, assuring citizens that things are going 
well and that there will soon be an upturn, whereas even the 
forecasts made by government research centers inexorably testify 
to the catastrophic fall in industrial production. As the 
famous song goes: "Everything is fine, beautiful Marchioness, 
everything is fine..." 
  The second reading of the draft federal budget, for which 
the 
Committee for Economic Policy has prepared detailed amendments, 
will take place this week. Their adoption will make it possible 
to solve the most acute problems of preserving the country's 
scientific-industrial potential, developing long-term spheres of 
scientific research, effecting conversion of the defense 
complex, preventing the degradation of the education system, and 
implementing the necessary investment programs. This will not 
have to be paid for by an increase in inflation and a growth in 
social tension. And responsibility for the management of state 
property must be reestablished and violations of legislation in 
foreign economic activity must be ended as soon as possible.

<F P=106> [Report by Pavel Anokhin: "They Found a `Stash.' And </F>
Immediately Shared It Out"] 
  [Text] Yesterday the State Duma began to examine the draft 
federal law "On the Federal Budget for 1994" at its second 
reading. 
  However, the previous day, Mikhail Zadornov, chairman of the 
State Duma Committee on Budget, Taxes, Banks and Finances, 
briefed journalists on his colleagues' stance. The deputy 
stated that they had received about 300 amendments to the draft 
law and studied them all carefully. The committee recommended 
that the State Duma and government find reserves in the sum of 
8.5 trillion rubles [R], mainly from foreign economic activity 
and state administration. Mikhail Zadornov proposes that this 
money be channeled into defense (R3.5 trillion for the purchase 
of arms and equipment on a targeted basis), into the financing 
of programs for the transfer, in Federation components, of funds 
from the balances of enterprises and departments into the local 
authorities' balances, and into research and development. There 
was also some for the development of fundamental science (R600 
billion) and for public education and the preservation of 
cultural monuments (R130 billion). 
  Mikhail Zadornov believes that the development of the 
economic situation in the first four months of this year 
confirms the worst fears -- the decline in production is 
continuing, collection of taxes is declining, and the deficit is 
already equivalent to approximately half the expenditure side of 
the budget. "The situation regarding nonpayments in a number of 
respects is worse than in summer 1992, when the nonpayments 
problem was at its peak," Mikhail Zadornov stressed. "That 
means that the income side of the budget as a whole is in 
jeopardy." According to the deputy, the committee refused to 
pledge income that is not realistic. 
  Journalists recalled the words of Russian Government 
Chairman 
Viktor Chernomyrdin, to the effect that there are no "secret 
stashes." And they inquired pressingly: Who is deceiving whom? 
The chairman of the budget committee avoided giving a direct 
answer and blamed the government for having no clear budget 
policy concept itself yet failing to accept the legislators' 
wishes.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Yermolin: "State Duma's June Schedule. </F>
Great Deal of Space Given to Army Topics"] 
  [Text] Our readers want to know what draft laws relating 
to defense and army life parliamentarians will be examining in 
June. Before naming some of them, announced in the June 
schedule, I have to say that the mention of a particular draft 
law (even when a specific date is given for the discussion) does 
not necessarily mean that the deputies will actually get round 
to it. 
  For instance, the draft State Duma decree "On Amendments to 
the 19 May 1993 Russian Federation Supreme Soviet Decree `On 
Some Measures Connected With the Implementation of the Russian 
Federation Law "On the Military Service Obligation and Military 
Service"'" is scheduled for discussion on 10 June. Let us 
remember that this decree was about reducing or suspending the 
effect of the preferential articles giving entitlement to 
deferment of conscription for military service. The 
conscription situation today is such that adjustments in the 
direction of further reducing the list of "privileged persons" 
are simply inevitable. 
  An examination of the draft federal law "On Amendments to 
the 
Russian Federation Law `On Defense'" is planned for 17 June. A 
whole range of amendments is envisaged, connected with the 
military doctrine that has been adopted and the further reform 
of the Russian Federation Armed Forces. 
  On 22 June the deputies may adopt on second reading the 
draft 
law "On the Procedure for Providing Russian Federation Military 
and Civilian Personnel for Participation in Operations to 
Maintain or Restore International Peace and Security and Other 
Types of Peacemaking Activity." The first reading was on 16 
March and the second was planned for the end of April. We are 
now in June. And our peacemakers are already moving up into 
position in Abkhazia... 
  The draft law "On Amendments and Additions to the Russian 
Federation Law `On the Russian Federation State Border'" is 
slated for its first reading on 22 June (how symbolic!). 
  The draft law "On the Defense Order," which has been a long 
time in gestation, will be submitted for the supreme assembly's 
perusal on 24 June. 
  The State Duma Council is to discuss in June draft laws "On 
Alternative Service," "On Military Courts," "On Russian 
Federation Counterintelligence Organs," "On Social Services for 
the Elderly and Infirm," and "On Veterans." The latter draft 
law, strangely enough, since it concerns our old people, is a 
contender for the "longest playing" title. This law has been 
gestating for an amazingly long time, considering that it had 
its first reading back last fall in the Russian Federation 
Supreme Soviet.

  [Text] The speaker of the Russian State Duma Ivan Rybkin is 
satisfied that the lower house of the Federal Assembly approved 
the federal budget for 1994 in the second reading. However, he 
is very critical about the attempt of the Federation Council to 
considerably increase defense spending. 
  In an exclusive interview with Interfax on Wednesday evening 
Rybkin said the swift approval of the budget by the Duma was no 
surprise for him. "I believed that the Duma would have the will, 
reason and endurance to do that", the speaker said. For the 
first time in three or four years the parliament tried to pull 
together the scattered financial resources of the country. 
  The speaker said that certain figures in the Federation 
Council did not want this to happen and they might attempt to 
tear up the budget. If anyone in the Council of the Federation 
tries to destroy the budget, Rybkin said, he is ready to tell 
the public who they used to be and why they have been 
undermining the budget for four years. 
  Last week the Federation Council spoke in favor of 
considerably increasing spending, in particular earmarking 55 
trillion rubles instead of 37.1 for defense. 
  On Wednesday the Duma approved in the second reading the 
federal budget without making any changes to the revenue, 
spending or deficit. 
  The Duma accepted the proposal of its budget committee to 
increase defense spending from 37.1 to 40.6 trillion rubles 
through a redistribution of resources in the budget.

  [Text] This morning the Russia's Choice faction in the 
State Duma decided to back the draft federal budget in the 
second reading if 3.5 trillion rubles more are allotted for the 
needs of defense structures, Russia's Choice member Sergey 
Yushenkov told Interfax. 
  He stressed that as the Chairman of the State Duma Committee 
on Defense he thought that the Army must be given 55 trillion 
rubles instead of the 37 trillion rubles stated in the draft 
budget. Yushenkov said he would vote for the proposal of the 
parliamentary Budget Committee providing for the increase in the 
funds for defense needs by 3.5 trillion rubles and for the 
amendment put forward by the Committee on Defense demanding that 
18 trillion rubles more be allotted for these purposes.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary under the "Quotation" rubric] </F>
  [Text] "... The former Supreme Soviet made a similar 
decision three years after the elections and died there and 
then. This is a sure road to death. Let the Duma set up its 
own channel. I will not be taking part in this...." 
  Aleksandr Yakovlev, head of the federal television and radio 
service, said this apropos of the well-known decision by the 
Duma to "flush" its debates and decrees through television 
channels. 
  Many politicians and journalists have since spoken in the 
same vein. But the Duma, despite the ominous precedent, seems 
to be bent on going whole hog. Freedom is for the free, as they 
say. Why is it, then, that the majority of the Duma should be 
taking chances so recklessly? Most probably because past 
illusions die hard. Too many politicians are still under the 
impression that television is a magic wand. That if you own it, 
you just have to whisper to it: Make me a deputy for another 
term, and your wish will be granted. 
  The "next term" is also the imminent presidential elections 
-- that's what eggs on the deputies to accost television. It is 
the experience of the Supreme Soviet that urges them to make 
haste. The disaster that hit the previous parliament can also 
be explained not by the fact that the then deputies created 
docile television three years after the elections, but that they 
did not create it three months after them. 
  In this case, though, the current deputies from various 
factions do not realize one thing: That doing so would win only 
one deputy, and only one faction -- Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and 
the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]. 
  The precedent is too fresh in our memory. As far as the LDPR 
leader is concerned, television is not an improved version of 
the megaphone, but really and truly a magic wand. This is what 
his friends-rivals have handed to Mr. Zhirinovskiy.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Ivanov incorporating interview with </F>
Colonel General of Aviation Viktor Prudnikov, commander in chief 
of the Russian Air Defense Forces: "Russia's Skies Are Not a 
Passageway. Air Defense Forces Forced American Plane To Land" 
-- date, place of interview not given] 
  [Text] There have been increasingly frequent instances 
recently of foreign aircraft ignoring the procedure for crossing 
the state border and for the use of airspace, penetrating deep 
into Russian territory and refusing to fulfill the demands of 
air traffic control organs. In the past two months alone, there 
have been seven such instances. The Air Defense Forces are 
obliged to take resolute measures against the violators. 
  And that is what happened on 7 June this year. At 1354 hours 
a Lockheed C-130 aircraft belonging to the U.S. airline "Rapid 
Aerotrans" entered Russia's 25-km border zone. It has emerged 
that the plane was on a flight from Frankfurt-am-Main to Tbilisi 
and had not filed the appropriate application. 
  The integrated air traffic control system's Main Center 
forbade the violator plane to fly over Russian Federation 
territory, but the Lockheed's crew ignored this order and 
penetrated 80 km into our airspace. Two Su-27 patrol fighters 
then took off from the Krymsk military airfield. But they did 
not get within 50 km of the target. On learning that the patrol 
forces had taken off, the U.S. violator plane declared its 
readiness to land at the nearest airport, and 16 minutes later 
it made a landing at Adler. 
  Our correspondent asked Colonel General of Aviation Viktor 
Prudnikov, commander in chief of the Air Defense Forces, to 
comment on the situation. 
  "Certain regions have emerged," the commander in chief 
stressed, "where violations of rules for the use of airspace 
have become frequent. First and foremost this is true of the 
North Caucasus. It is surprising, because everyone knows that 
before crossing a border, a plane must make contact with the 
relevant air traffic control organs and confirm its intention to 
enter the country's airspace. And that can only be done with 
permission. It is also well known that the appropriate 
applications have to be filed the day before the flight in 
accordance with the established procedure. 
  "The cases that have been occurring recently indicate that 
nobody is notifying anyone and that random incursions into 
Russia's airspace are taking place." 
  [Ivanov] What are the reasons why foreign aircraft fail to 
carry out the orders of the air traffic control services? 
  [Prudnikov] Some people have the impression that the former 
Union has broken up into independent states which are not yet 
quite ready to exercise proper control of their airspace. There 
are also elements of contempt for the existing rules. People 
sometimes think it will all pass off with impunity. So that 
nobody forms the desire to test our air borders or behave like 
hooligans in the air, I will say that these opinions should be 
refuted by actions. In some regions recently, where the 
situation so requires, we have stepped up our monitoring of the 
air. In order to establish visual contact with a violator plane 
we are obliged to bring our fighters to within a short distance 
of it, which could lead to complications regarding compliance 
with safety measures. I hope that appropriate measures will be 
adopted in the near future, first and foremost in the CIS 
countries, to prevent violations of the laws and ensure safe 
flights for all the aircraft using our airspace. 
  [Ivanov] In the present situation our state has to count 
every kopek. Additional measures by patrol forces against 
violators are costly. Is it not time to demand compensation for 
the economic loss sustained due to unlawful actions in Russia's 
skies? 
  [Prudnikov] Bringing in additional resources and sending up 
patrol fighters is certainly costly. We do the calculations and 
draw up an account for payment. But at a certain stage, 
apparently, there is insufficient insistence on the payment of 
compensation. I suppose if our state organs took a firmer 
stance on this, not so many people would be willing to commit 
violations. After all, intercepting every such flight costs the 
Air Defense Forces tens of millions of rubles. [interview ends] 
  [Ivanov] So the Air Defense Forces have shown that nobody 
can violate Russia's air borders with impunity. Defense 
Minister Army General Pavel Grachev has given a high appraisal 
of their patrol crews' actions.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Kudakayev report in the "Incident" column: </F>
"Russian Fighter Aircraft Force Landed a U.S. Air Force Plane"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] On the evening of 7 June a 
Pentagon spokesman stated that the chain of events connected 
with the U.S. aircraft incident has not been accurately 
recreated yet. U.S. Ambassador to Moscow Thomas Pickering 
thanked the Russian side for "the tact and understanding" shown 
during the plane incident. 
  Some time ago an Israeli private plane was forced to land 
under similar circumstances. Some experts doubt that such 
frequent incidents in the same area are accidental. Rather this 
is a deliberate violation of the established procedures for 
activating the air defense system in this region. Following the 
disintegration of the Union system, Russia had to create new 
border lines, in particular in the Caucasus, which have become a 
subject of study by U.S. and NATO electronic surveillance 
centers in Turkey. The presence of reconnaissance equipment 
aboard the C-130 is not ruled out. According to flight 
documents, there was a diplomatic cargo aboard the plane, and so 
its inspection was unlikely.

<F P=106> [Sergey Zavorotnyy report: "U.S. Hand Has Not Grown Weary </F>
of Striking. U.S. Plans for Invasion of Haiti"] 
  [Text] Buenos Aires -- A specter is haunting Latin 
America. The specter of a U.S. military invasion. The head of 
the U.S. Administration has dusted it down and set it in train. 
Bill Clinton seems to need to show his compatriots and the 
world at large that he is a real man and not just an accidental 
"occupant" of the White House apartments. How can the United 
States claim to rule the world if it cannot cope with the 
insolent Haitian dictator General Raul Cedras, who is refusing 
under any circumstances to return power to Haiti's legally 
elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide? 
  Pentagon specialists have already elaborated a plan for the 
occupation of Haiti. It is envisaged that the U.S. Marines 
would land first and carry out "surgical" strikes on and 
neutralize the Haitian Army. Having performed their mission, 
the Americans would leave and their place would be taken by 
inter-American forces created on the basis of contingents from 
the Latin American armies. Flying the flag of the United 
Nations and the OAS, they would be responsible for the main task 
of keeping the peace on Haiti and ensuring cooperation between 
the president as he returns to the country by foreign force of 
arms and the local bureaucracy. 
  Exiled President Aristide has long advocated the U.S. plan. 
Senor Caputo, UN and OAS representative on Haiti, is in favor of 
the invasion. But what about the Latin American countries? 
Will they agree to pull Washington's chestnuts out of the fire? 
At the moment only one country -- Argentina -- has given its 
assent. Its President Carlos Menem has long hankered after 
exploits in the Caribbean in company with Washington. An 
Argentine frigate is already off the coast of Haiti. The other 
states in Latin America still remember former U.S. expeditions 
to Grenada (1983) and Panama (1989). Following the U.S. 
occupation of Grenada little changed there. Poverty and 
corruption in the top echelons of power are still the most 
striking feature of the incumbent democratic regime. The 
Americans promised Panama they would liberate it from the 
domination of the international drugs mafia. Some 4,000 
civilian lives were sacrificed to these promises. However, 
General Noriega has long been in jail yet Panama still remains a 
paradise for the drug barons' operations. 
  But who remembers that today when the occupation of Grenada 
boosted Reagan's popularity and the Panama operation turned Bush 
into one of the most popular of U.S. presidents? Today others' 
laurels are giving Clinton no peace.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov, Nikita </F>
Yermakov and Igor Shchegolev] 
  [Text] Paris June 8 TASS -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev said on Wednesday that the Partnership for Peace 
programme has a role to play in building a unified Europe. 
  Meeting journalists at the Russian Embassy in Paris on 
Wednesday, Kozyrev said Russia wants to see cooperation with 
NATO without mutual vetoes and surprises. "Our cooperation with 
NATO has certain peculiarities because Russia differs from other 
countries in size, army strength and influence and is a nuclear 
power," he continued. 
  He said that military problems must not dominate the world 
agenda any more, otherwise it could lead to the 
re-militarisation of political relations in Europe. 
  The Russian minister called for holding a new meeting of the 
foreign ministers on Bosnia as soon as possible. It is 
necessary to hold it "within the next week or two" as proposed 
by President Boris Yeltsin in order to move closer to a 
political settlement of the conflict. 
  On the domestic front, Russia said it would send a 
peace-keeping contingent to Abkhazia within the next few days. 
Kozyrev said this decision has nothing to do with the imperial 
policy or irresponsibility. This is a normal policy of a 
responsible country which closely cooperates with the United 
Nations and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe 
(CSCE) to settle regional conflicts, he added. 
  Seeking to play a greater role in world politics, Russia has 
been actively engaged in the preparations for the upcoming G-7 
summit meeting to be held in Naples in July. Kozyrev said that 
the dialogue in Naples will consist of two parts. One will deal 
with Russian economic reforms and Russia's relations with G-7. 
It will be held in the seven plus one format. 
  The other one to be held in the G-8 format will allow the 
leaders of eight countries to discuss jointly, on equal terms, 
large problems of world politics, particularly Bosnia, the 
construction of a united Europe and the upcoming session of the 
CSCE heads of state and government to be held in Budapest at the 
end of the year, Kozyrev said. 
  The Russian foreign minister has already met with U.S. 
Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown to discuss bilateral 
cooperation between Russia and the United States. He called for 
the soonest possible elimination of the vestiges of the cold war 
hampering business partnership between Russia and the United 
States. The meeting was part of the preparations for a session 
of the Russian-U.S. joint commission on trade and scientific 
and technical cooperation to be held in Washington. The 
commission is co-chaired by Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin and U.S. Vice-President Al Gore.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Vyacheslav Yelagin: "Metamorphoses in </F>
European Policy"] 
  [Excerpts] After the Russian defense minister's visit to 
Brussels it became absolutely clear that Russia is going to join 
the Partnership for Peace program. In Pavel Grachev's words, 
this position was confirmed to him by Boris Yeltsin on the eve 
of the trip to NATO headquarters. NATO's leading circles 
breathed a sigh of relief, not least because Russia does not 
intend to put forward any prior conditions about the program. 
What is left now is to wait for the signing of the framework 
agreement, then, apparently, the presentation document will be 
elaborated and after that, possibly, will come the adoption of 
the Statement of Intent enshrining the desire of Russia and NATO 
to conclude a large-scale agreement on strategic partnership 
outside the framework of the program. 
  In that case the question of Russia's special role, as the 
West is signaling, will apparently not meet with any objections. 
I would like to hope that this viewpoint will be adhered to in 
those countries which have been reacting extremely sensitively 
to the problem of Russia's mutual relations with the North 
Atlantic Alliance. After all, Russia has every justification 
for such a role. In the first place it is a major European 
country with a mighty economic potential. Second, Russia is a 
nuclear power which moreover is not pursuing narrow, selfish 
aims with regard to its neighbors near and far. Consequently, 
Russia and the North Atlantic bloc simply cannot but cooperate 
closely in the discussion of topical European problems. That 
factor is increasingly beginning to be understood by 
sober-minded Western politicians. Many of them realize that 
Russia, despite the difficulties it is experiencing, remains a 
most important factor of regional security on the continent. 
  That was confirmed by the speech by Czech Defense Minister 
A. 
Baudys at an international seminar in Prague entitled "Security 
in Central Europe -- Public Opinion." The speech expressed the 
idea of the need to take into account Russia's balancing role in 
Europe. Well, such an understanding deserves attention. 
  Unfortunately, by no means all politicians obey commonsense 
logic. At the same conference in Prague Czech Deputy Foreign 
Minister P. Bratinka, apparently in pique at his defense 
minister, spoke again about Russia's attempts to restore its 
"sphere of influence in Central and Eastern Europe" which, in 
his words, should be resisted by a firm NATO and EU policy 
toward Russia. In short, what we see here are diametrically 
opposed approaches by two leading figures in the Czech Republic, 
and furthermore, members of the executive structures. [passage 
omitted] 
  Varying assessments of Russia's policy are characteristic of 
other international meetings recently. That was clearly shown 
by the North Atlantic Assembly session in Oslo. For example, 
the representatives of the West European states and the United 
States finally expressed understanding for Russia's 
participation in peacemaking operations on the territory of the 
CIS countries. Meanwhile, their colleagues from Estonia and 
Latvia, who even there distinguished themselves by their attacks 
on Russia, still called such participation "neoimperialism." 
  New extremes have appeared in our as yet unbuilt common 
European home. It is primarily in Central and Eastern Europe 
that they are causing apprehension. This is the fear that the 
small countries might again become a target in a "geopolitical 
game" among the great and large powers. Is that not the reason 
for the extremely nervous reaction to the activation of 
Russo-German ties? The revived dialogue between Moscow and Bonn 
was yet again the reason that some familiar expressions from the 
times of bloc confrontation have begun to appear in the 
vocabulary of certain politicians. 
  Only one piece of advice can be given to such "strategists": 
Do not inflame unnecessary passions. Moscow is not weaving any 
intrigues or hatching any treacherous schemes against other 
countries. It would like to be integrated into Europe as an 
equal partner. But such integration presupposes a consideration 
of Russia's interests, too, for example, access for Russian 
experts to work on the new "COCOM" and the renunciation of all 
forms of pressure regarding Russia's export of arms to third 
countries. Then, you see, that would also remove some of 
Moscow's "imperial ambitions" which various foreign politicians 
and the mass media are so fond of expatiating about today.

  [Text] Paris June 8 -- Russia will send a peace-keeping 
contingent to Abkhazia within the next few days, Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev said. 
  Meeting journalists at the Russian embassy in Paris on 
Wednesday, Kozyrev said that no other country is ready to follow 
Russia's suit so far. The decision to send peace-keepers to the 
war zone has nothing to do with the imperial policy or 
irresponsibility, he added. This is a normal policy of a 
responsible country which closely cooperates with the United 
Nations and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe, he said.

  [Excerpt] Two or 3,000 Russian blue helmets in Abkhazia and 
more than 1,500 in the Armenian-Azeri conflict zone may be 
introduced by Russia in the near future. They will help the 
cease- fire and the disengagement of the combatant sides. This 
is primarily what Defense Minister Grachev will talk about. An 
informed source in the Georgian leadership does not rule out the 
possibility of the peacemaking operation in Abkhazia starting 
during Grachev's visit to the republic. [passage omitted]

  [Text] In an interview with Georgian radio, Georgian head

peacekeeping forces into Abkhazia is decided. This has been 
confirmed once again by Russian President Boris Yeltsin in a 
telephone conversation, and details are now being finalized for 
this operation, which will unfold just as planned. Any 
breakdown in the peacekeeping operation would undermine the 
authority of the Commonwealth of Independent States as a 
regional organization and would be a great blow to Russian 
policy, the Georgian head of state stressed. 
  Shevardnadze noted that a breakdown in the peace process 
would affect Russia deeply, as Russia's ethnic interest has 
preserved its status as a peacekeeper in the former USSR.

  [Text] Today Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev left 
for the Caucasian republics on a working visit in order to 
discuss with the Armenian, Azerbaijani, and Georgian leaders 
issues on the establishment of Russian military bases on the 
territory of their countries, Grachev's aide Yelena Agapova told 
INTERFAX. 
  Grachev will first stop in Yerevan and meet Armenian 
President Levon Ter-Petrosyan. Subsequently, Grachev will meet 
Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze in Tbilisi. 
  The Azerbaijani leadership has asked Grachev to come to Baku 
in order to speak to Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev. 
  Russia intends to have about thirty military bases and 
facilities in neighboring countries, namely, three in Georgia, 
two in Armenia and a station for warning against a military 
attack in Azerbaijan. 
  During his meetings with the Caucasian leaders Grachev is 
expected to discuss peace-keeping operations in Nagorno-Karabakh 
and in the zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict. 
  Well-informed sources in Tbilisi suggested in an interview 
with an INTERFAX correspondent that during Grachev's visit to 
Georgia the peace-keeping operation may begin in the zone of the 
Georgian- Abkhazian conflict. The same sources said that at the 
first stage the conflicting parties would be separated by the 
Russian units stationed in Caucasus.

  [Text] Paris, 8 Jun -- Russia proposes the holding of 
another foreign ministers' meeting on a settlement in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina should be moved up. This was stated today by 
Andrey Kozyrev, head of the Russian foreign policy department, 
speaking to journalists at the Russian Embassy in France. 
  Today's exchange of opinion with French Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe and other colleagues on the efforts of the "contact 
group" on Bosnia convinces one that the difficulties in its work 
should not serve as pretext for postponing the meeting of 
ministers, he pointed out. On the contrary, "in the next week 
or two" a second meeting of ministers on the Bosnian problem 
should be held. "It is clear that a political level is needed, 
first of ministers, and then also of the leaders of the 
countries in keeping with the initiative of President Boris 
Yeltsin, in order to bring forward a political resolution of the 
conflict," the head of Russian diplomacy stressed. "The `contact 
group' was able to do some important preparatory work, but it 
cannot replace the ministers." So, in his opinion, a ministerial 
meeting should not be postponed. 
  The first such meeting was held in Geneva on 13 May with the 
foreign ministers of Russia, the USA, and five countries of the 
European Union participating.

  [Text] Moscow hopes that the United States and Russia's 
other western partners will exert their influence on the Bosnian 
Moslems and Croats in order to reach a ceasefire agreement in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, a top-ranking Russian diplomat in charge 
for the settlement in the former Yugoslavia said in his 
interview with Interfax. 
  In his words, the Geneva meeting between the special envoy 
of 
the UN General Secretary Yasusi Akasi and representatives of the 
confronting Bosnian parties was fruitless. "Moslems and Croats 
agree only to a quadripartite ceasefire with its possible 
prolongation for four weeks. The Bosnian Serbs are ready to 
cease fire at least for four months," the diplomat indicated. 
  As he said, "fears that the Serbs would try to preserve the 
status-quo and to fix themselves on 70 percent of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina stand behind the obstinacy of the Moslems and 
Croats." "One cannot say that these fears are groundless. The 
threat of "an ethnic cleansing" in Bosnia and Herzegovina is 
still preserved and all confronting parties are the source of 
this threat, noted Interfax interlocutor. But it is quite 
obvious that nobody will let the Serbs violate the proportion of 
division which was coordinated at the ministers' meeting in 
Geneva; in accordance with this agreement the Serbs will receive 
49and the Moslem-Croatian federation -- 512000060100f the territory 
of this former Yugoslavian republic." 
  According to the diplomat, "one cannot permit that the fears 
of one of the parties would "suspend" the process of peaceful 
settlement in Bosnia." "In an adverse case the world community 
will be forced to begin everything from the very beginning," he 
said.

  [Text] Moscow, al-Sayf [June] 8 (JANA) -- Russia commended 
the execution of the decision of the International Court of 
Justice regarding Aozou between the Great Jamahiriyah and Chad. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the 
implementation of the ruling will open up a new era for Africa. 
  Observors believe that the wide international commending of 
the stance of the Great Jamahiriyah which responds to all 
international conventions and decisions did not come out of 
vacuum but it showed the firm and principled commitment which 
became clear through the way the Great Jamahiriyah dealt with 
some issues between herself and other countries including the 
continental shelf case with sisterly Tunisia and the republic of 
Malta and recently with Chad through the implementation of the 
ruling of the International Court of Justice regarding Aozou.

  [Text] Moscow, 8 Jun -- Russia favors the unconditional 
observation of the provisions of the UN Security Council 
resolution of 1 June this year on banning weapons' supplies to 
Yemen. The ITAR-TASS correspondent was told this today by 
Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Russian Foreign Ministry's 
department of information and the press. He said that it was in 
the common interests of the world community "to deprive the 
internecine conflict of fuel." The warring sides, he said, 
should finally heed the voice of reason, cease the senseless 
destruction of their own country, and return to the path of 
political dialogue. 
  Despite the efforts to stop the bloodshed, the official 
spokesman of the Russian foreign policy department said, reports 
are continuing to come from Yemen about large-scale combat 
actions and more deaths and destruction. In this connection, he 
stressed, Russia welcomes the efforts to achieve a normalization 
of the situation by the UN Security Council, the League of Arab 
States, the countries of the Persian Gulf, and other 
international mediators, and Russia confirms its readiness to 
coordinate actions toward the soonest possible cessation of the 
fratricidal conflict.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Shalnev: "Russia Has Become a Proving </F>
Ground for `Exotic Intelligence Services'"] 
  [Text] The Russian authorities are concerned about the 
espionage activity being conducted against us by Asian 
countries, in particular China and North Korea. Yuriy Baturin, 
national security adviser to the Russian president, told foreign 
journalists this. 
  As he put it, "this problem has arisen comparatively 
recently 
and is capable of being solved. We have discussed it at various 
levels with various departments. And now measures are being 
adopted to prevent the leakage of technologies, in particular 
dual-purpose technologies." 
  To illustrate the espionage problem, Baturin reported that 
"in the past five months" Russian counterintelligence has caught 
red-handed a North Korean spy who was operating under diplomatic 
cover. No theft of technologies by the Chinese has been 
observed this year, he said, although he added that there have 
been cases where the competent organs have discovered 
"approaches to top secret facilities." In these situations, 
preventive measures have been adopted. 
  Informed sources in Russian counterintelligence, commenting 
on the presidential adviser's remarks, confirmed that "Russia 
has today become a proving ground for all kinds of intelligence 
services, some of them exotic. The intelligence services 
operate in a brazen and barefaced manner." The sources declined 
to comment on the detention of the North Korean or to cite 
examples of operations against Russia by the Chinese. "As 
regards the Chinese," the sources stressed, "we are especially 
concerned about the spread of Chinese criminal structures, in 
Maritime Kray in particular. [no closing quotation marks as 
published] It was also stressed that the existing system in 
China enables Beijing to make use of any citizens, whatever 
their status, in the interests of intelligence work. 
  On the subject of espionage, Baturin explained the problem, 
in part, in terms of the economic situation in Russia. "I am 
convinced," he observed, "that if our specialists were 
guaranteed more appropriate living conditions, there would be no 
need for more active counterintelligence activity, nothing would 
find its way to China via these specialists, and they themselves 
would never leave for China." 
  The president's adviser also noted the wide scale of illegal 
immigration by Chinese people to Russia, taking place mainly via 
the former Union republics (in particular Kazakhstan), which are 
not capable of property controlling their borders with China. 
As Baturin stressed, the Kremlin is interested in an agreement 
with Kazakhstan that would enable Russia to organize tougher 
security measures on the borders.

  [Text] Moscow, 9 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- Russia is taking steps 
aimed at unblocking the situation around the DPRK by political 
methods. This was stated at a briefing today by Grigoriy 
Karasin, director of the department of information and press of 
the Russian federation Foreign Ministry in connection with the 
recent deterioration of the DPRK's nuclear problem. 
  "This approach," he noted, "envisions the need for Pyongyang 
to ensure the IAEA has access to the relevant facilities and 
information by the agreed deadlines and the convening of an 
International conference for a comprehensive examination of the 
problems of security on the Korean peninsula. If these 
diplomatic efforts are not successful the sanctions proposal 
will have to be examined." 
  Replying to a question regarding relations and economic 
cooperation between Russia and North Korea, Grigoriy Karasin 
said that "relations with the DPRK are developing in a normal 
way, cooperation is continuing, including on the question of the 
work of the lumberjacks on Russian territory." During the talks 
which were held between representatives of the Russian and DPRK 
Foreign Ministries it proved possible to settle a number of 
questions, he added.

  [Text] Deputy Russian Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov 
believes the matter will not get to international sanctions 
against North Korea. He made the statement on Thursday in an 
interview with INTERFAX. 
  According to Panov, Russia's stand concerning the 
possibility 
of international sanctions is unchanged: Moscow stands for 
political methods to be used first. If the talks between the 
United States and North Korea have deadlocked, let's come to an 
international multilateral consultations. If it fails, there 
first should be a warning on the possible introduction of 
sanctions, and only after that sanctions, said Panov. 
  He said that during the telephone talk on Wednesday between 
Presidents of Russia and South Korea, Boris Yeltsin confirmed 
the position, which was told to Kim Yong-sam during his recent 
visit to Moscow. Panov believes the introduction of sanctions 
now that North Korea began to show a more favorable attitude to 
the Russian proposal on the convocation of an international 
conference, would be illogical. 
  The diplomat said the interests for the conference was 
growing since this is a realistic way out of the situation. Now 
practically no one stands against the conference. The 
differences are only in time limits, he said. Some people 
believe the conference should be held after sanctions are 
introduced against Pyongyang. But this is a strange approach. 
What conference could we talk about after the sanctions are 
introduced? 
  Panov believes that the initial stage of the conference 
could 
be held swiftly. First we should reach a consent in principle. 
If so, it would be possible to come to agreement on what 
conditions the conference will assemble. North Korea and the 
United States, for example, could assume some commitments after 
which experts would start working over the conference program 
and procedure items, he said. 
  He said that the question on the conference venue had been 
discussed. We believe the conference could gather in Geneva and 
later pass in turns in Pyongyang and Seoul, he said. 
  According to Panov, Russia stands for the convocation of a 
conference not because it is against the talks between the 
United States and North Korea. We stand for the use of all 
means. It is possible to use the Moscow-Pyongyang talks if it 
is still possible, if it will really be fruitful. Now the 
channel is blocked, said the diplomat. 
  According to him, Beijing believes otherwise and continues 
staking on further talks between North Korea and the United 
States. We do not rule out the importance of the channel. We 
believe it works no longer, said Panov. 
  He said that no one confirms yet that North Korea has a 
nuclear bomb. The International Atomic Energy Agency has not 
yet concluded that North Korea created nuclear weapons. 
According to the statement by the Agency it cannot guarantee 
that North Korea did not take steps to develop Plutonium. This 
is the essence of the problem, said Panov. 
  He said of principle for Russia is the preservation of the 
nuclear weapons non-proliferation. It is outside our interests 
that in the Far East, near Russian borders, there appeared 
another nuclear power, said the diplomat. 
  To the question about the treaty between North Korea and the 
former Soviet Union, of which Russia is the successor, Panov 
said that now the treaty does not exist in full measure. The 
treaty must change depending on the situation and circumstances. 
Now we unilaterally interpret the first article of the treaty. 
Now Moscow must not help North Korea under any circumstances, 
he said. 
  The diplomat answered favorably to the question on the 
possible unification of the two Koreas. This has always been a 
single state and a single people. The unification is possible, 
of course. It is quite another matter how things will pass and 
how much time this will take. Much time, I believe, said Panov.

  [Text] The United States, Japan, and the ROK have suggested 
that the UN Security Council hold urgent discussions over the 
issue of imposing sanctions against the DPRK. 
  Our station commentator (Grichevsky) has written the 
following: 
  The situation surrounding Korea's nuclear facilities is 
worsening. It has been directly caused by the following: 
  At the moment, North Korean experts are quickly removing 
nuclear material used at the atomic reactor in Yongbyon. 
  If this work proceeds at such a pace, the International 
Atomic Energy Agency inspectors will lose all chances of 
(?inspections) and will not be able to guarantee that the DPRK 
has not diverted nuclear materials for military purposes. 
Therefore, the issue of imposing sanctions against the DPRK has 
been raised again. 
  The United States, Japan, and the ROK are calling for an 
immediate imposition of sanctions. Also joining them are other 
countries such as Australia and France. 
  By the way, another storm surrounding the DPRK's nuclear 
facilities seems to be largely connected with another factor, 
that is, Russia's position. This position was (?expressed) 
during the Russia-ROK summit held not long ago. 
  President Yeltsin said Russia would join in the imposition 
of 
sanctions only in the extreme case that all possibility for 
talks was completely gone and that the DPRK withdrew from the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. President Yeltsin's remark has 
already been distorted by many mass media as an agreement to the 
imposition of sanctions. 
  The solution to the Korean peninsula nuclear issue depends a 
lot on Russia. Some people even emphasize that Russia has the 
key to the very solution of the issue and knows how to use such 
a key. 
  Nothing can be said about that mysterious key but, as far as 
Moscow's position is concerned, we can definitely state that 
Moscow is going to find a peaceful, steady solution to the 
issue. We would like to point out that only in an extreme case 
would Russia join in the imposition of sanctions. 
  In fact, as all possibilities have now been used, Russia has 
put forth a proposal for holding an international conference 
over this issue, a matter of concern of many countries. 
  The ROK agrees to the holding of an international 
conference. 
  U.S. President Clinton has emphasized that it is good to 
hold 
such a conference (?at an early date). The expression is very 
vague, and a question is arising soon as to whether the time 
will come when sanctions will be imposed on the DPRK. 
  Beijing is also very concerned about the situation on the 
Korean peninsula. But, the remarks by Chinese leaders express 
the hope that Korea's nuclear issue will be peacefully settled. 
  China's support to Russia's proposal for an international 
conference will undoubtedly be able to play an important 
stabilizing role. 
  It surprises us that Pyongyang is rejecting the idea of 
holding an international conference. They are also calling for 
talks between the DPRK and the United States, while saying that 
they are trying to settle the dispute by way of talks. The 
United States does not agree to this. 
  Therefore, the prospect for a peaceful settlement of the 
situation of the Korean peninsula is that the situation is going 
further into a deadlock. It is needless to say how dangerous 
this is to the whole Asian and Pacific region.

<F P=106> [Commentary by (Anatoliy Botakov) from the "Today's World" </F>
program] 
  [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency's [IAEA] 
letter to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali is being 
discussed by the UN Security Council. 
  The United States, Japan, and the ROK are vigorously trying 
to impose economic sanctions against Pyongyang. Considering 
that the PRC might veto the decision, the United States is 
evaluating the possibility of so-called sanction measures to 
apply economic pressure. First, the measure bans all contracts 
related to weapon sales. The embargo does not include coal and 
petroleum. The economic sanction measures are another means to 
obtain UN Security Council approval. 
  Russia reminds them of the fact that gradual and phased 
sanctions by an international organ would not be opposed when 
all other measures have failed. Considering the PRC position, I 
think making a decision on an embargo by the UN Security Council 
would be impossible at the moment. 
  Therefore, it is urgent to convene an international 
conference for the security and denuclearization of the Korean 
peninsula as proposed by Russia. The conference may be attended 
by the representatives of the DPRK, South Korea, Russia, the 
United States, the PRC, Japan, the United Nations, and the IAEA. 
The conference should be an authoritative conference that 
contributes to ending the dangerous confrontation on the 
peninsula and enables the DPRK to express its concerns during 
the progress. 
  U.S. President Clinton had a telephone conversation with 
Boris Yeltsin last week and said that the conference may be 
appropriate at a certain time. I would like to ask him what is 
the appropriate time? Is it after sanctions are imposed? I 
doubt anything could be achieved at that point. 
  In addition to its proposal, Moscow is prepared to evaluate 
other coordination measures. However, all possible political 
measures should be taken. 
  There are reports that the United States, Japan, and South 
Korea are preparing three-party sanctions against Pyongyang 
without a UN decision. They should not forget that Russia has 
great economic and trading interests in the DPRK. 
  When independent three-party sanctions are imposed, Russia 
will be in a position to consider its own legal interests.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Morozov commentary: "Korean Bomb Gives Whole World </F>
a Headache"] 
  [Text] Almost 10 years has gone by since the concept of 
the "Korean nuclear problem" was invented, which, to the man in 
the street, means the possession of a bomb by the "unpredictable 
regime in North Korea." In that time both international 
organizations, including the United Nations, and the press have 
talked sometimes of a bomb that has already been created, and 
have sometimes said that it is on the point of being 
manufactured. However, so far no one has produced evidence of 
the bomb -- neither the Americans, nor the Koreans themselves. 
Pyongyang is continuing to insist that it is not even dreaming 
of having its own nuclear cudgel. Meanwhile, the United States 
is preparing to implement economic sanctions against the DPRK 
and persuade the rest of the world to do the same -- the 
Americans themselves have never had trade dealings with the 
DPRK. There has even been some talk of a military solution to 
the problem. 
  It is hard to object to sanctions, which could solve the 
problem, although they threaten the emergence of yet another hot 
spot on Russia's borders. But will sanctions provide the answer 
to a number of very important questions? 
  First of all, why has Pyongyang taken such a long time to 
furnish itself with a nuclear bomb (the first nuclear reactor in 
the DPRK was started up in 1965)? Why, by analogy with the 
"Korean nuclear problem," does the world not know about the 
"Israeli," the "Pakistani," or anyone else's problem? No one 
can guarantee the absence of a bomb in those states. How much 
will it cost Russia to suddenly discontinue economic relations 
with the DPRK as a trade partner of many years' standing? The 
wise Chinese will most likely refuse to participate in the 
sanctions. Why at the time was there no such concern about the 
acquisition by Pyongyang of MiG-29 aircraft? After all, it is 
clear to the most pathetic expert in distant France or Great 
Britain that the use of these airplanes (with conventional 
weapons) against the nine nuclear electric power stations in 
South Korea is no less dangerous than the detonation of a 
nuclear munition. 
  It is also unclear why all the "interested" parties, 
including the DPRK, have unambiguously failed to support the 
Russian idea to convene an international conference to break the 
"deadlock," while the United States is moving increasingly 
toward the use of coercive methods. Is not the present massive 
pressure on the DPRK connected with the U.S. President's 
statement that the campaign for freedom which began with the 
landing of the allied troops in Normandy in 1944 did not end 
with the demise of the USSR? You get the impression that the 
United States, Japan, South Korea, and indeed Pyongyang itself 
are not worried by the problem as such of the nonproliferation 
of nuclear weapons, but that each of these countries is 
exploiting it merely to achieve its own political ends.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Varlamov] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo, 8 Jun -- Russia and Japan have confirmed the 
common policy of the two countries of developing bilateral 
relations and continuing talks on the territorial problem and 
also their readiness to coordinate efforts in the matter of 
settling the crisis situation regarding the DPRK nuclear 
programme. An ITAR-TASS correspondent was informed at the 
Russian department of the Japanese Foreign Ministry that this 
was discussed at a brief meeting between Andrey Kozyrev, the RF 
[Russian Federation] foreign minister, and Nobuo Matsunaga, 
special representative of the Japanese Government to the 
international talks, which were held in Paris today. They are 
taking part in a session of the Organisation of Economic 
Cooperation and Development, which is being held in the French 
capital. 
  The Japanese representative noted that a certain amount of 
progress has been achieved in advancing the political and 
economic dialogue between the two neighbouring countries since 
the visit by Boris Yeltsin, the RF president, to Tokyo and 
stressed the need for the further development of 
Russian-Japanese ties on the basis of the "Tokyo declaration" 
which was signed on the results of the summit in October 1993. 
  The Russian minister confirmed the invitation for Tsutomu 
Hata, the Japanese prime minister, to make an official visit to 
Moscow this year. However, according to the Japanese Foreign 
Ministry staffer, the sides did not touch on the issue of 
specific dates for the possible trip.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the news segment of </F>
the "Dalniy Vostok" program] 
  [Text] Japan could have begun construction of a maritime 
complex for the storage and processing of liquid radioactive 
waste from the Pacific Fleet in Maritime Kray in June [sentence 
as heard]. A corresponding intergovernmental agreement has been 
concluded and construction will be financed from the $100 
million which Japan has earmarked as aid for Russia and the CIS 
countries for dismantling nuclear weapons. 
  Selection of a maritime waste storage system was conditioned 
by the Maritime Kray people's opposition to storage of 
radioactive substances on land. In this way Tokyo will 
contribute to speeding up the stalled process of nuclear 
disarmament in the Far East, particularly where nuclear 
submarines are concerned, since only the unsolved problem of 
liquid radioactive waste is hampering their dismantlement. 
Presently the tanker TNT-5 [on which liquid waste is stored] 
has been moved from the bay near Bolshoy Kamen village further 
south to Pavlovskogo Bay.

  [Text] Poachers tried to enter the Russian waters off the 
isle of Kunashir in the Russian Far East on 14 occasions from 
June 1 to 6. They approached from the Japanese island of 
Hokkaido without identification signs or navigation lights in 
poor visibility. 
  The Russian border guards had to fire warning shots, 
Lieutenant General Vitaliy Sedykh, commander of the Pacific 
border guard district told the Japanese consul in Vladivostok 
Wednesday. 
  The Russian border guard press office reported that the 
poachers did not respond to all demands to stop. As they 
escaped, they cut off the nets in which large amounts of fish 
died. 
  Sedykh said that warning shots were fired in the early hours 
of June 4 and 6 when two poaching schooners and six schooners 
respectively were sighted. 
  The border guards fired over 300 30 mm and around 10 76 mm 
shells.

<F P=106> [Igor Yavlyanskiy report: "The Russian Premier Is a Little </F>
Tired but Right on Form"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Viktor Chernomyrdin, a patient at the 
university clinic in Mainz, southern Germany, held a news 
conference Tuesday. The Russian head of government was wearing 
not a hospital gown but a severe suit. He looked somewhat 
tired, but he was right on form. 
  The prime minister said that he had come to Germany on an 
unofficial, private visit in order to consult local medics on a 
kidney stone [kamenno-pochechnyy] disorder. "The diagnosis has 
already been made in Russia, but I would like to have a second 
opinion." 
  Professor Rudolf Khoyenfellner, under whose direction 
medical 
tests were conducted, refused to go into medical details: "We 
are obliged to observe medical confidentiality. There are no 
grounds now for breaking this rule. We regard illness as a 
personal problem." 
  [Yavlyanskiy] Is this an ordinary case of kidney stone 
disease? 
  [Khoyenfellner] Stones are, in general, something abnormal. 
Although we do frequently encounter this ailment. It is just 
that in this case we are dealing with a somewhat unusual form of 
the disorder. 
  Questions to Chernomyrdin: 
  [Unidentified journalist] What is of most concern to you 
now, taking a global view of the world? 
  [Chernomyrdin] Affairs in Russia. Our country is going 
through a difficult period. Much depends on the government for 
which I am responsible. We are now proposing a number of 
additional measures to accelerate the reforms. I am in no doubt 
that a turning point will come. I am taking the opportunity to 
work here as well. One of the chief issues is to attract 
foreign investments. 
  [Unidentified journalist] Are you planning to pay an 
official visit to Germany this year? 
  [Chernomyrdin] To be honest, both countries need such 
contacts. There are plans for such a trip. But it has not yet 
been decided exactly when. 
  [Unidentified journalist] It is said that you are writing 
your memoirs and intend to publish them in Germany.... 
  [Chernomyrdin] I have already answered this question in 
Krasnodar recently. I am not writing anything. I am not in the 
mood for these things now. I am no writer. I do not regard 
myself as one. That is not even in my thoughts. It is 
incredible! Does this mean that people are saying I traveled 
south to write my memoirs? In fact I spent three days sitting 
in a helicopter, dashing about the region. 
  [Unidentified journalist] What if you are offered an 
operation? 
  [Chernomyrdin] It is not very complex, the way I understand 
it. We will get it done here and complete the treatment in 
Russia.

<F P=106> [Report by Ole Mathismoen: "European Financial Aid for the </F>
Kola Peninsula"] 
  [Text] The European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (EBRD) will give 185 million kroner to make the 
nuclear power station on the Kola Peninsula safe. 
  Yesterday the board of the bank approved a detailed 
investment plan for the Kola power station and two other Russian 
nuclear power stations. A decision in principle to give money 
was reached last year. 
  Certain negotiations with Russian authorities remain before 
the work can start. In return the EBRD wants the Russians to 
shut down some of the oldest and most dangerous reactors. On 
the Kola Peninsula one possibility is shutting down one of the 
two old reactors earlier than planned. Russian authorities have 
announced that they will shut it down in the year 2000. 
  The money will come from the special fund for making safe 
nuclear power stations in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union 
which the G-7 countries set up in 1992 and which has since grown 
to sizeable proportions. Last year the Nordic area, 
Switzerland, the Netherlands and the EU [European Union] 
Commission joined the fund. The fund currently contains around 
1.2 billion kroner. Norway has paid in 16.5 million. 
  The largest and most important of the planned investments in 
Polyarnyye Zori on the Kola Peninsula is an emergency cooling 
system. Today the power station would only be able to stand a 
cooling system breakdown of an estimated six hours before the 
reactor core in one of the four reactors would melt. 
  "The danger of accidents would be reduced as a result. The 
employees would have much longer time for repairs," assistant 
director Torbjorn Norendal of the Foreign Ministry said. He is 
Norway's representative on the board of the bank. 
  Other elements in the investment plan are new and better 
fire 
equipment, instruments which are able to give operators more 
rapid warning that an accident is taking place, equipment for 
measuring radioactive emissions outside the power station 
itself, a number of safety values, and other surveillance 
equipment. Everything will go out to international tender. The 
board bank will decide on the final allocation of funds at its 
July meeting. 
  Norway has already donated equipment worth 20 million kroner 
to the power station. It is Norendal's view that the money from 
the EBRD will increase the safety of the power station 
considerably. 
  It is planned that the investments will be made in the 
course 
of 1995 and 1996. The other two power stations which will 
receive similar help are Sosnovyy Bor near St. Petersburg and 
Novo-Voronezh south of Moscow. 
  Bellona [Norwegian environmental organization] was among the 
first to raise the alarm about the state of affairs at the 
nuclear power station only a few miles from Norway. Expert 
Frederic Hauge is skeptical toward the EBRD's investment plan. 
  "This money does not solve the biggest problem. The main 
threat is that the workers at the power station are not being 
paid. It is now a month and a half since they were paid, and 
last week there was a phone call with an anonymous threat that 
reactor 4 would be set on fire if wages were not paid," Hauge 
said. 
  He believes that it would have a great effect if Finland 
stopped importing electricity from the power station. 
  "I would also have liked to have seen how much progress 
would 
have been made if the 180 million had been spent on energy 
saving measures and the development of local gas power," he said. 
  A united Nordic area in the EU could mean large-scale 
economic and expert support for the nuclear cleanup in the 
north, Bettina Lorz of the EU's Environmental Directorate 
(DG-11) said. She has played a central role in the EEA 
[European Economic Area] negotiations and the negotiations on 
membership for the Nordic countries. Yesterday she took part at 
a seminar in Oslo on the EU and the environment. 
  She received the support of the EU's ambassador to Norway, 
Aneurin Rhys Hughes: "As yet the EU has not allocated money to 
the Kola Peninsula problems. This is something that will change 
radically when Norway becomes a member," he said. 
  Bettina Lorz told AFTENPOSTEN that there are some 
significant 
funds in the EU which are to be used for important environmental 
measures in Eastern Europe. Today they are being used to make 
safe nuclear installations, primarily nuclear power stations, in 
the immediate vicinity of today's EU countries. 
  "Even though the EU is of course already involved in what is 
happening in the Barents Sea region, its involvement would 
increase dramatically if Norway, Sweden, and Finland join. The 
Kola Peninsula would then become the EU's closest neighbor in 
the north," she said.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Golts: "Celebration in Normandy: </F>
Grand Spectacle Or Missed Chance?"] 
  [Text] It seems that the organizers of the celebration of 
the 50th anniversary of the allied landing in Normandy have 
expended on its organization almost as many resources as they 
did half a century ago on the actual operation. Judging from 
press reports it was indeed a grand affair. Up above, World War 
II aircraft, including the legendary Spitfire, gave way to 
modern fighters; while demonstration airborne assaults gave way 
to amphibious landings. Fifteen warships took part in the naval 
review, including the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier George 
Washington. Amphibious vehicles put ashore bearing the colors of 
the units which took part in the landing. There were also 
grateful speeches addressed to the veterans by leaders of the 
states whose soldiers stormed the beaches of Normandy, along 
with parades and wreath-laying ceremonies. 
  Yet for all the solemnity of the celebrations and the 
genuine 
enthusiasm of their participants, what took place prompts the 
feeling that something extremely important was left unsaid and 
undone. The country -- Russia -- without which neither the 
Normandy landing nor victory would have been possible took no 
part in the celebrations. Unfortunately, the Cold War has also 
cast its shadow over our common victory (let us recall that it 
was then that the actual "united nations" concept appeared). 
For many years our former allies, who had become our enemies, 
kept silent about the other side's role in crushing fascism. 
  Now that confrontation has become a thing of the past, a 
chance has appeared to break the habit of dividing the great 
victory into "ours" and "not ours." So far this chance has not 
been taken. What a great pity. After all, what is the point of 
organizing such celebrations? Above all, of course, it is to 
pay due respect to those who achieved this feat. 
  But something else is important: Such celebrations are 
necessary to remind us of the unity of mankind in opposing the 
forces of evil. And today are not fascism, aggressive 
nationalism, and dictatorships of various types and sorts not 
throwing down a challenge to freedom? Today is there no need to 
oppose these challenges with combined efforts? Nowadays, when 
East and West -- with considerable difficulties -- are trying to 
create a new European and global security architecture by 
overcoming their own prejudices and fighting other people's, 
many people are seeking a historical linchpin for new 
cooperation. The brotherhood-in-arms of World War II could be 
such a linchpin. The chance to demonstrate this was missed in 
Normandy. The 50th anniversary of victory presents another 
chance to show that the division of the world has been done away 
with. Let us hope that the politicians are perspicacious enough 
not to miss that one as well.

<F P=106> [Aleksey Bausin report: "Anniversary: Are We Outsiders at </F>
These Celebrations?"] 
  [Text] Russia was not invited to the celebrations of the 
50th anniversary of the Allied forces' landing in Normandy. 
That is, a Russian delegation is nonetheless staying in one of 
the towns where the celebrations will be held. But the Russian 
president did not turn up at the "summit meeting" to mark 6 June 
1944. 
  Many commentators believe that whereas the Normandy landing 
was for Britain and the United States a belated attempt to start 
having some kind of real effect on the course of the war, the 
Red Army offensive was in essence not only a crusade of 
liberation but also the expansion of communism. Admittedly, 
this does not take into consideration the fact that Russia now 
seems to be a democratic country. But it seems that the 
destruction of communism alone is not enough to join the 
amicable family of European peoples.... However, as President 
Yeltsin remarked, the fact that we are not invited is no reason 
to take umbrage and perceive this as evidence of mistrust of 
Russia on the part of its former allies in the anti-Hitler 
coalition. 
  A situation where "you have your celebrations and we will 
have ours" would have been more appropriate during the previous 
Berlin Wall era. But you increasingly get the impression that 
the destruction of this notorious wall has not made Europe truly 
united. We can argue at length that Russia is a European 
country and that we should finally take up a proper position on 
the continent. However, just as nothing came of the idea of a 
"common European home," so nothing is coming of Russia's stately 
"entry" into Europe. Our partners periodically hint that Russia 
can be described as a European power only in the geographical 
context. But not in the political context. The celebration of 
the Allied forces' Normandy landings -- like, moreover the 
ceremony marking the withdrawal of the Allies' troops from 
German territory -- has shown us that once again....

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Correspondents </F>
Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others] 
  [Text] Moscow does not see any serious problems in 
relations with Turkey. "Individual anti-Russian statements by 
Turkish representatives should be viewed as a reflection of the 
inner political game," director of the Russian Foreign 
Ministry's 4th Asian Department Valeriy Yegoshkin told Interfax. 
  He said that the recent statement by Chief of the Turkish 
General Staff Dogan Gyuresh to the effect that Russia continued 
to pursue an imperial policy in the region must not be perceived 
as a symptom of cooling in Russian-Turkish relations. 
  To quote Yegoshkin, this statement was made in a complicated 
inner political context and was intended for inner use. Anti- 
Russian statements had been made in Turkey before. However, the 
statement in question went far beyond the limits of the 
admissible, which caused a sharp response in Russia, he said. 
  The Ankara officials have isolated themselves from this 
statement. General Gyuresh also asserts that he was 
misunderstood, he continued. In his opinion, Russia and Turkey 
had good prospects for cooperation. Although various Turkish 
quarters have a different attitude to Russian-Turkish 
rapprochement, it is early yet to talk about the deterioration 
of bilateral relations, he said. 
  Yegoshkin doubts that a serious clash may occur between the 
Russian and Turkish interests during the division of spheres of 
influence in the Black Sea region and the Turkic republics of 
the former Soviet Union. "The Turkish representatives we are 
dealing with try to isolate themselves from the pan-Turkic 
moods. They say that Ankara recognizes Russia's legitimate 
interests in the Turkic world and does not try to assume a 
dominating role. We have no reasons for treating them with 
misgiving," he said. 
  Speaking about free navigation through Bosporus and 
Dardanelles which Turkey is trying to limit, Yegoshkin expressed 
hope that Ankara will not disregard the opinion of the world 
community. "If it does, it may find itself in complete 
isolation. Not a single country has supported the introduction 
of new rules. Moreover, Turkey's strongest critics are its 
neighbors, who are against barriers complicating the passage of 
their ships through Bosporus and Dardanelles, he said. 
  Commenting on the utilization of the resources of the 
Caspian 
Sea by all countries of the region, Yegoshkin said the position 
of Azerbaijan created certain problems. 
  The countries of the Caspian region have equal access to the 
Caspian Sea which not divided into territorial waters or 
economic zones, he said. 
  To quote Yegoshkin, Baku has a different opinion. Azerbaijan 
would like to own a large part of the Caspian Sea and attract 
foreign companies for developing the Caspian oil deposits. 
Azerbaijan's unilateral moves may damage the interests of other 
Caspian countries. Such problems must be tackled at a 
negotiating table by all the countries concerned, he said.

  [Text] Russian spokesmen have categorically denied reports 
from Beijing that the crashed Tu-154 aircraft had supposedly 
undergone two major overhauls before it started operating in the 
PRC. 
  Feliks Myasnikov, general director of the "Aviaeksport" 
Foreign Economic Association, has reported that a new aircaft 
was supplied to China under contract in 1986. Since then the 
airliner, in full accordance with the recommended norms, has 
undergone one planned overhaul, which was carried out at the 
repair plant at Vnukovo in 1992. According to Feliks Myasnikov, 
the Chinese side has not submitted data on the aircraft's 
operation, but there can be no question of its operating life 
having been exceeded with regard to any of the parameters. 
  The Main Aviation Industry Administration of the Russian 
Federation State Committee for Defense Sectors of Industry has 
reported that at the time of the aircraft's handover to the PRC 
it had flown for 32 hours within the framework of control tests.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 8 Jun--The newspaper OBSERVADOR 
ECONOMICO, which is published in Montevideo, reported on Tuesday 
that the Uruguay firm "Imaribo" has purchased Ka-32 all-weather 
helicopters, which are being manufactured in the town of 
Zhukovskiy in Moscow Oblast, for ice reconnaissance and for the 
transportation of cargo. Under a contract with the firm, a group 
of Russian engineers in Uruguay is fitting these helicopters 
with weapons; they are a civilian version of the mass-produced 
combat helicopters. Afterwards, they will be resold to other 
countries. The first helicopter has already been purchased by 
Peru's Armed Forces. 
  The Ka-32 helicopters are being delivered from Russia by sea 
to Uruguay's free economic zone, to the town of Florida, 90 km 
north of the Uruguayan capital. Each helicopter costs no less 
than 2.5 million dollars. The newspaper notes that these 
helicopters are one of the most promising models in Russia, 
which are noted for their high degree of maneuverability. 
During the war in Afghanistan, these helicopters, fitted with 
weapons, proved their combat effectiveness. In addition to 
this, they have a spacious cargo compartment and equipment for 
the transportation of suspended cargo. The Ka-32 helicopters can 
be used to assemble equipment, lay power lines, and also to 
carry out operations to rescue people and equipment during 
natural disasters. 
  The Uruguayan newspaper notes that the intention in Peru is 
to use the helicopter to fight the drug mafia. Contracts for 
the sale of the military version of the Ka-32 helicopters have 
already been concluded with a number of other Latin American 
countries.

<F P=106> [Viktor Zamyatin report: "Russian-Brazilian Arms Trade. </F>
Russian Missiles To Emerge on Banks of Amazon"] 
  [Text] It was announced yesterday that Brazil will buy 
from Russia 110 "Igla" surface-to-air missiles (analogue of the 
"Stinger"). Russia has emerged on the Brazilian arms market for 
the first time. 
  Under the contract, the weapons will be delivered to Brazil 
by the end of this year. Brazilian authorities narrowed down 
their choice to the Russian missiles having become convinced 
that despite the low price tag (they are the cheapest in the 
world -- KOMMERSANT- DAILY), "Iglas" are not only a match for 
"Stingers" but are even superior to them in a number of 
parameters. The missile purchase is part of the $2 billion, 
four-year trade agreement signed in 1993. The cost of the 
missile contract has not been given. It is only known that $100 
million was earmarked to buy missiles from Russia for Brazil's 
army with some money remaining to effect some other payments. 
This means that the contract to buy "Iglas" would be followed 
by some others (Brazil, among other things, is showing interest 
in Russian helicopters). One cannot at this stage speak 
seriously about Russia's competing against the main suppliers of 
arms to the region -- the United States and France -- because 
the size of the deal concluded is too small. Incidentally, 
Brazil recently bought a batch of accoutrements in the United 
States. 
  Concurrently with the signing of the missile contract, 
Russia 
and Brazil also decided to exchange military attaches in their 
embassies. An agreement to this effect was signed by Georgiy 
Mamedov, Russian deputy foreign minister.

<F P=106> [Nikolay Musiyenko report: "Crimea: A View Through the </F>
Prism of the Civil Code"] 
  [Text] Aleksey Manannikov, deputy chairman of the Russian 
Federation Federal Assembly International Affairs Committee, has 
come up with a proposal to hold a session of the Russian 
Federation Federation Council in Sevastopol, Simferopol, or in 
any other Crimean city. 
  In his letter to Vladimir Shumeyko, speaker of the upper 
house of the Russian parliament, he rationalizes the need for 
such a session by the fact that the former Supreme Soviet of 
Russia, which paid much attention to studying whether the power 
organs of the former USSR and the RSFSR observed in 1954 all the 
casuistic subtleties in turning Crimea over to the Ukrainian 
SSR's subordination, did not study at all the question of 
whether those organs were competent at all to complete such a 
transaction. 
  "It is a well-known fact that the Crimean Autonomous 
Republic 
existed before World War II," A. Manannikov writes. "In 1945, 
the ranking officials, who did not bother even to honor the laws 
and the generally recognized rights and freedoms of their 
citizens, made a decision abolishing the Crimean republic. The 
criminal decision entailed the exiling from Crimea of a great 
number of citizens of Tatar, Greek, German, Armenian, Bulgarian, 
and other nationalities...." 
  The author of the letter thinks that the decision on 
abolishing the Crimean Autonomous Republic as part of the USSR, 
and on a transfer of the territory thus "freed" from its 
legitimate owners to someone else, should be deemed invalid, 
signifying that "taking account of the opinion of the majority 
of the population of the Crimean Republic, measures should be 
taken toward an amicable agreement on restoring it to its lawful 
master, that is to Russia." 
  Drawing an analogy with civil legislation, A. Manannikov 
quotes from Part III, Article 152 of the Civil Code: "If some 
property should be acquired without payment from a person who 
had no right to give it away, the owner shall have the right to 
claim it in all instances." And he concludes: "Authorities of 
the Ukrainian state have no more rights to claiming legitimacy 
for owning Tavrida [Crimea] than does a citizen who receives as 
a present from a thief some stolen property (fur coat, necklace, 
etc.)."

<F P=106> [Alisher Niyazov report under the "They're Shooting All </F>
Around" rubric: "Tajik Opposition Settling a Score"] 
  [Excerpt] Lieutenant General Anatoliy Chechulin, commander 
of the Russian border troops in Tajikistan, has charged the 
extremist wing of the armed opposition with unleashing terror 
against the Russian military contingent in the republic, as well 
as against ethnic Russian officers serving in the national Armed 
Forces. 
  He made this statement at an extraordinary press conference 
for Russian and foreign correspondents. To all appearances, the 
patience of the Russian command has become exhausted in the wake 
of yet another killing, this time involving a senior officer of 
the Russian border troops staff, Lieutenant Colonel Sergey 
Leontikov. He was shot and killed, according to eyewitnesses, 
outside his garage by three unidentified persons. All in all 
eight Russians, including six servicemen, were killed between 31 
May and 4 June. 
  In A. Chechulin's words, those well-organized and directed 
terrorist acts are nothing else but the carrying out of threats 
by leaders of the Islamic Rebirth Movement of Tajikistan. A. 
Chechulin promised that the Russian military would no longer 
tolerate the bandit threat from whoever it comes, and that 
authorized weapons and equipment would be drawn upon to protect 
Russians. Mechislav Senkevich, who took part in the press 
conference, stated toughly that Russia would take all measures 
to protect both the Russian servicemen and the Russian-speaking 
population in Tajikistan. [passage omitted].

  [Text] On 7 June Colonel General Andrey Nikolayev, 
commander in chief of Russian Federation Border Troops, received 
from Tajikistan a telegram from Imamali Rakhmonov, chairman of 
the republic's National Assembly. In it the head of Tajikistan 
expressed his sincere condolences in connection with the tragic 
deaths of Russian border guards -- Lieutenant Colonels 
Borisenkov and Leontikov. "The criminals," the telegram says, 
"who have encroached on a most blessed thing -- the lives of 
Russia's sons who, answering the call of duty and conscience, 
were protecting the Tajik soil that had become their own -- will 
not go unpunished. Some of them are already in the hands of the 
law, the others will be found and punished with all the severity 
of the law...." 
  Meanwhile, in Tajikistan everything is being done to get 
control of the acute criminogenic situation. On 7 June 24-hour 
joint patrols of Tajik and Russian servicemen began. Areas 
where Russian servicemen and their families live have been put 
under special guard.

Mikhail Melnik] 
  [Text] Kiev 8 June TASS - "If sanctions are imposed on 
North Korea, its leadership will have to act adequately to the 
situation," North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam said. 
  Speaking at a news conference in Kiev on Wednesday [8 June], 
Kim Yong-nam said that "we will choose the concrete form of 
self-defence when we know what measures the countries demanding 
`punishment' for North Korea intend to take." 
  The minister stressed that the "nuclear problem is 
artificial. It was created by certain circles in the U.S. and 
IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) in order to strangle 
socialism in the country." "The nuclear crisis on the peninsular 
must be solved by the United States and North Korea through 
negotiations," he said. 
  "The participation of other countries is out of the 
question," he added. 
  Commenting on Russia's initiative to convene an 
international 
meeting on North Korea, Kim Yong-nam described it as 
"interesting," adding that "we are studying it." 
  The minister expressed the confidence that "the intention of 
the U.S. and IAEA to inspect nuclear reactors is closely 
connected with the opening up of the country's military 
facilities." He termed it as an "interference in the internal 
affairs of the state." "We are not against inspections, but only 
there where there are nuclear reactors," he added. 
  Speaking about Pyongyang's position, Kim Yong-nam said that 
"until the United States fulfills its obligations in full, North 
Korea will not join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty." 
"These obligations call for an end to hostile policy and nuclear 
threat to the state, and for preservation of peace and security 
on the peninsular, impartial policy and assistance in converting 
the reactors working on light water," he said. 
  "We are in such a position that we cannot trust the United 
States unless our conditions are met," the minister said.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow 8 June TASS -- According to information 
received from Russian naval sources, the main problem of the 
two-day negotiations between the Russian and Ukrainian 
delegations, which began today in Kiev, is to divide the bases 
and coastal infrastructure of the Black Sea Fleet. 
  The Russian delegation is led by roving Ambassador Yuriy 
Dubinin. He arrived in the Ukrainian capital together with 
Admiral Feliks Gromov, commander-in-chief of the Russian Navy. 
The admiral told ITAR-TASS on the eve of the trip, that the 
sides were able to switch over during their talks in Moscow and 
Sevastopol from verbal declarations to the concrete discussion 
of the difficult problem of drawing up a complete list of all 
the warships and other surface craft, and deciding where the 
Black Sea Navy and the Ukrainian naval forces should be based. 
This work will be continued in Kiev. He noted that the 
parameters, according to which the warships should be divided 
between the two sides, were already been determined. Working 
parallel with military experts are economists and financiers, 
who are estimating the cost of the ships and of the fleet's 
infrastructure. Their conclusions will be submitted to the two 
delegations. 
  Gromov believes that both sides will table their own drafts 
during the negotiations. He does not rule out differences on 
individual matters, but believes that it is necessary to do 
everything to achieve mutual understanding.

  [Text] Relations between Ukraine and Russia should be build 
on a long-term basis. The head of our state, Leonid Kravchuk, 
declared this in an interview for the Moscow-based newspaper 
TRUD. According to him, relations between the two countries 
should be sincere and those of partnership, truly friendly and 
equal. Leonid Kravchuk flatly denied a possibility of any 
military clash between Ukraine and Russia. He devoted a 
significant part of his interview to the Crimean issue. It was 
again emphasized that he comes out against any force methods of 
solving it.

  [Text] Sevastopol, 8 Jun--The coordinating council of the 
Black Sea Fleet officers' meeting assessed the emergence of a 
battalion of the National Guard of Ukraine in the city as an act 
of moral and psychological pressure against the people of 
Sevastopol. As was reported by Yuliya Syrotynska, a staff 
member of the public relations center at the Sevastopol 
Department of Internal Affairs, the National Guardsmen arrived 
in Sevastopol last week to help local militiamen maintain public 
order. The joint patrolling of the city streets allows better 
coverage of the areas to be patrolled. 
  In their letter, addressed to the chairman of the local 
administration, the leaders of the coordinating council of the 
Black Sea Fleet officers' meeting voiced their protest against 
the introduction of additional troops at a time when 
contradictions between the leadership of Crimea and the 
leadership of Ukraine are aggravated.

  [Text] Kiev, [no dateline as received] -- During the 
division of the Black Sea Fleet, Ukraine can receive 18.3 
percent of each class of ships, give or take 5 percent depending 
on the importance of a particular class of ships for Ukraine. 
This proposal satisfied both sides at the Ukrainian-Russian 
negotiations on the Black Sea Fleet on 8 June. 
  Experts on both sides also agreed on the division of 
warships. The list now has to be approved by members of 
Ukraine's and Russia's state delegations. 
  The talks on 9 June will concern the thorniest issue of 
dividing the coastal infrastructure. Russia proposes that the 
main base of the Russian part of the fleet should be Sevastopol. 
But the Ukrainian side proposes that the final document puts it 
in a different way: not "the main base of the Black Sea Fleet is 
the city of Sevastopol" but "the main base of the Black Sea 
Fleet is in the city of Sevastopol." 
  Commenting on the course of negotiations, Russia's 
ambassador 
to Ukraine Leonid Smolyakov said: "There are breakthroughs, and 
the talks are held in a balanced manner." Asked by UNIAN 
whether an agreement on the Black Sea Fleet could be signed 
before the presidential election in Ukraine, Leonid Smolyakov 
said no. In his opinion, "the problem of coexistence and 
interaction between two large military structures cannot be 
solved in a short space of time." According to the ambassador, 
"the problem of the Black Sea Fleet will continue to exist after 
26 June."

  [Text] On 2 June, the Ukrainian Navy Odessa Garrison, 
instructed by the Ukrainian Navy General Headquarters in 
Sevastopol, disconnected the Mars-75 navigation system, which 
had been ensuring safe navigation of the Black Sea Fleet vessels 
in waters near Odessa. 
  As Captain First Rank Dmytro Ukrayinets, Odessa senior 
maritime commander, explained, this step was taken in response 
to the Black Sea Fleet Command's refusal to cooperate with the 
Ukrainian Navy on various issues. 
  Henceforth, Russia will independently resolve problems of 
safe navigation in the Odessa zone of the Black Sea.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with presidential candidate Leonid </F>
Kuchma by Valeriy Pavlenko; place and date not given: "What We 
Need Is Self-Confidence and Vigor..."] 
  [Text] Leonid Kuchma, chairman of the Ukrainian Union of 
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs [USPP], has a lot of business 
to handle. Having delivered a report at the sixth congress of 
the USPP, he set out on the road again. It was an overseas 
trip, but only for five days. However, he managed to do a lot 
during this trip. The list of U.S. high officials, with whom 
Kuchma met, is rather impressive. I would like to decipher this 
list by not only listing names, but also reporting on opinions, 
assessments, and proposals. Naturally, my first question was 
about this trip. 
  [Kuchma] I was invited to the United States by the 
International Fund for Democracy and Development, of which Nixon 
was honorary chairman until his death. My first talks were with 
P. Rosenblat, acting chairman of the Fund. Next, I met with 
U.S. Vice President A. Gore; E. Leica, U.S. presidential 
assistant for national security; and N. Burns, U.S. presidential 
special assistant for Eurasian affairs. Moreover, there were 
meetings with Deputy Secretary of Defense E. Carter and Deputy 
Secretary of Finance L. Summers. 
  There were also meetings with the presidents of 
international 
funds -- M. Camdessus of the IMF and Z. Brzezinski of the Soros 
Foundation. The following must be taken into consideration. The 
secretary of finance was quite frank: If financial assistance 
continues to be pumped into accounts in foreign banks or sticks 
to hands of dodgers, no further aid to Ukraine will be planned. 
In his turn, Camdessus stated that he come to Ukraine to help 
with our reforms without delay if a strong executive power is 
launched along with a realistic program for overcoming economic 
crisis. 
  [Pavlenko] Apart from assistance, can we see any U.S. 
readiness to participate in Ukrainian economy on the basis of, 
say, new investments? 
  [Kuchma] There were such proposals. Here is an example. 
The president of the Onasisas [name as transliterated] Company, 
owner E. Kulukundis, is ready to invest large sums in the 
development of our freight fleet. However, a barrier in the way 
toward the implementation of this project is the lack of 
legislation guaranteeing investments and a clear system of 
mutual obligations. The contact with Ukrainian immigrants was 
also satisfying -- the immigrants believe that the relations 
with Ukraine should be multilateral, in particular, on economic 
basis as well. 
  [Pavlenko] Have you discussed the well-known missile 
problems? 
  [Kuchma] This was the main topic of my conversation with 
U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Carter. My opinion about this is 
clear: Ukraine alone is not able to deal with the entire complex 
of missile problems. Dismantling main parts is only the tip of 
the iceberg. In order to carry out the entire project, even 
according to modest estimates by U.S. experts, Ukraine needs no 
less than $3 billion, whereas only a tenth of this sum was 
allotted. Of course, Ukraine does not have such funds. Nor do 
we have the technology for using liquid and solid rocket fuel. 
I think that even U.S. assistance will not suffice here. We 
will apparently be forced to involve the entire world community. 
Otherwise, we will not avoid another large-scale environmental 
disaster. It is necessary to apportion the allotted funds 
taking into account not only the consultations by U.S. experts, 
but also the needs of Ukrainian enterprises. 
  [Pavlenko] Prevailing opinion holds that there are no people 
in Ukraine who are capable of working out and implementing an 
effective program for leading the economy out of the total 
collapse of production. Do you share this opinion? 
  [Kuchma] The extraordinary fourth congress of the USPP was 
convened due to no more than the acute aggravation of the social 
and economical situation in Ukraine. During the first quarter, 
industrial production decreased by one-third, while in machine 
building, light industry, and metallurgy -- by 40-45 percent. 
Hundreds of enterprises were halted; over half of the total 
number work for only two-three days a week. Construction, 
transportation, and communication are in breaking down. 
Marketability of the agricultural sector --its grain complex -- 
is under threat. Reduction of investments in all spheres of 
production is fraught with tragic consequences. The same can be 
said about the disintegration of science, education, medicine, 
and culture. A general indicator of the total disintegration 
can be seen in the crisis of payments and paralysis of financial 
system. Exports are dwindling, hard currency incoming is 
decreasing, whereas domestic and foreign debts of the state have 
arisen to an astronomical sum. 
  The living standard of the majority is well below the 
poverty 
line, while the wage guaranteed by the state in the amount of 
60,000 karbovanetses, equivalent to slightly over $1, is simply 
cynical mockery. Logic dictates that the government, beginning 
1 January, should have increased the minimum wage and pensions 
by at least three or four times. At the same time, corruption, 
embezzlement of public funds, violence, bribery, and robbery 
have become mass plagues. Central and local state authorities 
only pretend that they are fighting this common evil. 
  I am sure that the main reason for this tragedy is the 
inability of current ruling structures to work out and implement 
a realistic policy in social and economic sphere. Instead of 
clear objectives and mechanisms for their achievement, we have 
slogans about market economy, reforms, privatization, farming, 
and destatization. In reality, robbing the country and 
transferring its wealth abroad by various operators continues. 
Official actions are not systematic or adequate to the needs of 
today's situation in the economy and community in general. 
Everywhere there are a flood of command administration methods 
in management and a swelling management apparatus with a low 
level of professionalism. Moreover, the central authorities are 
trying to evade responsibility by loading it on the shoulders of 
regions and producers. 
  Possibly, I am too harsh, but you know -- it boils not only 
within me alone... 
  [Pavlenko] However, you did not mention ways out of the 
crisis... 
  [Kuchma] During the last six months alone, the USPP, the 
Ukrainian Union of Independent Entrepreneurs, and other 
organizations, national as well as regional, which represent 
various forms of ownership, repeatedly proposed to the president 
and Cabinet of Ministers packets of measures regarding this 
question. There were among others: changes in hard currency 
regulations, taxation, and external economic relations as well 
as the determination of the priority of these relations; issues 
of utilizing working capital, repaying mutual indebtedness, 
restoring ties with CIS countries on a qualitatively new basis; 
revision of the scope of ministries and departments with the 
purpose of broadening the prerogatives of enterprises; 
introduction of state contracts; and many other measures. 
However, there was only silence. And they do not even try to 
take some measures by themselves... 
  [Pavlenko] By the way, how are your relations with the 
present Cabinet of Ministers and its head? 
  [Kuchma] I will answer by citing a passage from the 
resolution of the USPP sixth congress: "To declare that the 
activities of the government and its Acting Prime Minister 
Zvyahilskyy caused extremely negative consequences, deepened 
chaos and economic ruin, and aggravated tension in the 
community, what can bring unforeseen consequences..." 
  [Pavlenko] While prime minister, you made a threatening 
statement that was addressed to those structures mired in 
corruption. 
  [Kuchma] In my time as prime minister, the Cabinet of 
Ministers prepared materials for 1,500 cases, which were later 
submitted to the General Prosecutor's Office. However, they 
have not been instigated. Just as it was with the Black Sea 
Steamship Company managers -- our commission worked out and 
prepared a document and submitted it to the former Supreme 
Council, but the Steamship Company manager was a people's 
deputy. And for what? The document got stuck somewhere in the 
corridors of the former legislative power. 
  [Pavlenko] How do you see the present geopolitical and 
internal situation of Ukraine from the perspective of the 
cochairman of the Interregional Bloc of Reforms [MBR]? What are 
the tasks of the Bloc? 
  [Kuchma] The MBR unites pragmatic people that are apparently 
distant from politics. Yet even they have understood that 
unless a political course for Ukraine is formulated today, that 
is, unless new and, above all, cardinal resolutions are adopted, 
it will be impossible to implement any economic reforms or 
programs. In essence, Ukraine's economy has become hostage to 
politics. What we see is geopolitical bankruptcy with national 
romanticism as the pivot of the entire political course. The 
lack of pragmatism in the approaches to geopolitics, an 
erroneous estimate of geopolitical scenarios, and a bolshevist 
desire to raze everything and start anew, have led to a 
situation in which Ukraine has become virtually an international 
castaway. 
  In our internal policy, for all practical purposes, we have 
anarchy; we see an incompatibility of interests of ruling 
central bureaucracy and regions. The creation of an 
equalitarian system for every region without taking into account 
their characteristics and contribution to the national economy 
objectively provokes the development of separatist tendencies 
aimed at the disintegration of Ukraine. 
  I also think it inadmissible if the June elections fail or 
be 
rescheduled -- due to strategic reasons, first of all. World 
practice shows that overcoming a crisis is possible only by 
having a rigid and consolidated executive power headed by the 
president who possesses the highest level of legitimacy. The 
president should be a pragmatic man who is supported by the 
majority and who is capable of opposing any influence from 
various groups and lobbies. 
  [Pavlenko] Your presidential candidacy is supported by the 
USPP. Do you think that your chances are higher than those of 
your rivals? 
  [Kuchma] All rivals are worthy opponents; every one of them 
is good in his own way. Therefore, I do not overestimate my own 
chances. 
  [Pavlenko] Is it prudent to hold presidential elections 
simultaneously with local ones? 
  [Kuchma] I am against the simultaneous elections. If this 
happens, then we will elect absolutely independent presidents 
for 48,000 settlements, 560 rayons, and 24 oblasts. Ukraine, as 
a state, will cease to be. If hamlets become sovereign, then 
how will the president govern the state? Unfortunately, it is 
too late to change the situation -- the elections must be held. 
  [Pavlenko] As a journalist, I have been working in Kharkiv 
Rayon for a long time. I can say that the people there treat 
you ambiguously. You impressed the working collectives when you 
were prime minister. However, managers' corps does not support 
you fully. Here is one of the objections: You call for 
friendship and cooperation with Russia, but you do not back it 
with concrete steps. This is not a general opinion, but it 
exists... 
  [Kuchma] Let my colleagues, the managers, strain their 
memory and remember that it was in Kharkiv that I signed a 
package of documents on customs cooperation at the meeting of 
representatives of 10 oblasts on the borders of Russia and 
Ukraine in June 1993. And who signed the declaration on the 
creation of economic union? And who proposed to lease the Black 
Sea Fleet and to pay the earned money for energy resources in 
order to get a respite for structural rebuilding? I will say 
also this. Today, Ukraine alone is not able to stabilize its 
economy, regulate finances, and invigorate investments even 
partially. I have said it many times and I repeat: Nobody can 
survive on his own. Neither Russia nor Kazakhstan nor Belarus. 
This has already been realized by the Balts, too. Only people 
in Ukraine seem to be incapable of realizing this in any way. We 
propose the creation of a mechanism of mutual assistance and 
mutual support with all the CIS countries and, in the first 
place, with Russia; we propose to attain common geopolitical and 
economic interests with our joint efforts. I emphasize: This 
step is expected by all the CIS countries. 
  Nikolay Ogarev, Hertsen's friend, said once: "What We Need 
is Self-Assurance and Vigor, While Despair Leads to Idleness." 
These are the very qualities -- self-assurance and vigor -- 
which we need so badly now! Away with despair! 
  [Pavlenko] Would you say a few words about yourself? Your 
biography is not widely known, because until recently you have 
not belonged to the people who were much discussed. 
  [Kuchma] I was born in the village Chaykyno, 
Novgorod-Siverskiy Rayon, Chernigov Oblast in 1928. I am 
Ukrainian. My father died defending Leningrad, my mother worked 
on a collective farm all her life and died several years ago. 
My elder brother was a drift miner who died at the age of 56 of 
silicosis, a professional disease. My sister who also worked in 
a mine, died at the age of 48. 
  I conclude my report on the meeting with Leonid Kuchma, a 
candidate for the high post of Ukrainian presidency, with a few 
brief notes from my notebook. After graduation from 
Dnipropetrovsk University, Kuchma worked for 32 years at the 
world's largest rocket complex (the Pivdenne design office and 
the Pivdennyy Mashzavod production amalgamation), moving through 
all the production stages -- from a designer to the general 
director of the Pivdenmash production company. By the way, in 
the spring of 1966, at the age of 28, he became the youngest 
technical supervisor of tests at the Baykonyr launching site in 
the whole history of rocket production of the former USSR. His 
was lucky -- he worked with such legendary creators of space 
technology as Yangel, Glushko, Utkin, Pilyugin, and Sergeyev. 
Kuchma is a Lenin prize winner for the creation of space 
technology. 
  He is married. His wife, Lyudmila Mykolayivna, an engineer, 
retired after 30 years of work at the Pivdenne design office. 
His daughter Olena, an economist, is 24 years old. His 
grandson, Roman, is three years old. His daughter and 
son-in-law live and work in Simferopol. Kuchma is very fond of 
ballads and likes to sing accompanying himself on the guitar. 
  These are only general features. A full portrait will be 
painted by the election campaign, by life itself.

  [Text] In an INTERFAX interview today Vladimir Karpov, aide 
to Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov, said that Meshkov must be 
granted extra powers to carry out economic reforms and that the 
president has no time to push laws through parliamentary 
commissions. 
  Last week Meshkov called on members of parliament to adopt a 
law giving legal authority to presidential decrees on matters, 
which are not currently subject to Crimean legislation. 
  Karpov said that at the talks between Kiev and Simferopol, 
at 
which he was a participant, the Ukrainian side was very well 
prepared while the Crimean delegates were not sufficiently 
qualified. For this reason the leadership had decided to change 
the composition of the delegation to include experienced lawyers 
and economists. 
  Karpov said that the Ukrainian delegation had begun by 
looking for a purely political solution to the problem. 
However, at the insistence of the Crimean side, both political 
and economic aspects had been considered. He added that the 
Crimean side had suggested concluding a treaty on the basis of 
that which exists between Russia and Tatarstan. 
  Karpov said that this would cause problems relating to the 
Ukrainian constitution, which maintains Ukraine is a unitary 
state, unlike Russia which is a federation. 
  He added that during the discussions both sides had agreed 
that there was a need to make changes to both the Crimean and 
Ukrainian constitutions. 
  Asked what changes they had in mind, Karpov said that Crimea 
needed more political and economic powers. If this happened, he 
said, the Crimean experience of economic reforms would be 
transferred to the whole of Ukraine. 
  "We do not want to be burden for Kiev, we can and we want to 
earn our own money," Karpov said. 
  On the question of the Black Sea Fleet Karpov said that the 
fleet "is a Russia fleet on Crimean territory. For this reason 
it should pay rent. It should be based at Sevastopol and the 
Ukrainian Navy should be based outside Crimea in Odessa and 
Nikolaevo."

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Crimean Economics Minister Andrey </F>
Chernyavskiy by announcer Igor Gavrilov in Moscow on 8 June; 
first in a series of features on Crimea entitled "The Last 
Frame" -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Chernyavskiy] When in February we came for our 
first acquaintance with Crimea, with Simferopol, we were taken 
aback by the Crimean people's exceptionally poor standard of 
living, although this is apparently the same for all of Ukraine. 
The Crimean economy has been drawn into the general economic 
crisis that has gripped all the former CIS countries, but this 
crisis is particularly dramatic in Russia and Ukraine. 
Inflation is galloping ahead in Ukraine; it is a particular 
feature of the Ukrainian economy, a particular feature of its 
leadership because of specific stances taken by the leaders and 
senior officials in the Council of Ministers and the bank, the 
people who make these kinds of decisions. 
  Last year, as you know, the Russian ruble depreciated to 
one-tenth of its value and the karbovanets to one-hundredth of 
its value. When you have this kind of depreciation of the 
currency, you get a very rapid drop in the standard of living 
for workers in the public sector, first and foremost, and the 
pensioners. Social tension increases sharply. The incomes of 
Crimean people have diverged from, and not overtaken, those of 
their neighbors across the Kerch strait, from Krasnodar Kray. 
All of this has given rise to great discontent with Crimea 
being part of Ukraine, to calls for Crimea to join the ruble 
zone and so on. 
  Analysis of the situation of Crimea demonstrates, moreover, 
that Crimean industry and agriculture were set up first and 
foremost to trade with Russia and Crimean industrial 
enterprises. Crimea has a lot of top-class enterprises that 
received large sums of capital investment even in the stagnation 
years and are now lying idle. These enterprises were oriented 
towards trading with Russia and obtaining materials from Russia. 
As economics minister, I have already had several trips to Kiev 
for consultations with the leadership of Ukraine on the reforms 
in Crimea. It is clear to us that any steps we might take can 
only be done with the good will of Ukraine. Moreover, certain 
steps were very well received by Ukraine, not well in the sense 
that somebody approved these steps in themselves, but in the 
sense that there was a view that these kinds of things needed to 
be done in Ukraine -- in particular, currency regulation. The 
fixed rate of the karbovanets is a colossal obstacle to getting 
Ukraine out of crisis. And now, as far as I know, Ukraine 
itself has made a decision to move to a floating exchange rate. 
  Crimea is a unique region in terms of its natural resources 
and its geographic situation, and we certainly need bolder 
economic solutions for Crimea, in my view. 
  [Gavrilov] That means you're saying there could be a free 
economic zone set up here, like many that have been set up. I 
believe such proposals have, in outline, been made? 
  [Chernyavskiy] Yes, we have come across such projects. You 
couldn't really make the whole of Crimea a free economic zone, 
because these zones are set up in areas where there are open 
spaces away from the inhabitants. Well, Crimea has developed 
industry and developed agriculture cooperatives actively with 
Ukraine and we are therefore not looking to set up a free 
economic zone. We are talking about the possiblity of 
implementing economic reforms more rapidly than Ukraine in the 
areas of currency regulation, of having a more active program of 
attracting foreign capital into Crimea. Many investors say they 
would put money into Crimea, but the stability question wipes 
out their intentions. 
  Crimea and Ukraine have a difficult relationship on the 
question of allocating central credit resources to Crimea. One 
could generalize and say credit allocation in Ukraine is not 
quite normal and is reminiscent of Russia at the start of 1992. 
All in all, everything in Ukraine reminds me of our Russian 
history of two or three years ago. However, in the area of 
finance and credit, Russia has made tangible steps forward in 
those years and has to some extent succeeded in setting up and 
stabilizing a new finance and credit system. I see that in 
Russia now there is no great difference between the Central Bank 
of Russia bank rate and that of commercial lending rates. In 
Ukraine there is this difference. 
  [Gavrilov] A lot of people are now talking about the Saburov 
team, Saburov's Moscow team, and you're a full member of that 
team. Can you tell me, please, what this team is? Is it people 
who just happen to be there or are they all people of like mind 
who knew each other before? 
  [Chernyavskiy] This idea arose because President Yuriy 
Meshkov invited Saburov in effect to be prime minister of 
Crimea, and Saburov then decided to invite in several people 
from Moscow to be able to implement a certain agreed policy. 
  [Gavrilov] Do you notice the effect that people say that 
Moscow invaders are coming in to get Crimea's economy to pick 
up? One hears rejoinders that "they" have lived in Moscow with 
their offices of economists and academics. 
  [Chernyavskiy] Professionally, I don't personally believe 
anybody is pushing me in Crimea, and it has always been the case 
that there have been a lot of people in the natural sciences 
coming here. If you're talking about economic centers, economic 
institutions, one's own economic school, there is none of that 
in Crimea. 
  [Gavrilov] Tell me, is it going to be hard for you and your 
Moscow friends to come here and work? 
  [Chernyavskiy] Yes, of course, it has been quite a drastic 
step and, of course, it is very difficult work. Moreover, we 
have taken a very big drop in income because officials are 
poorly paid in Crimea by Russian standards. For the time being 
I still see my mission in Crimea as interesting. 
  [Gavrilov] You won't run away? 
  [Chernyavskiy] That's a good question. When we came to 
Crimea in February, I and probably all members of the team 
started to look at Crimean problems from the standpoint of 
Crimea and... [broadcast of interview ends] 
  [Gavrilov] That was Crimean Economics Minister Andrey 
Chernyavskiy.

  [Text] It is usually said: "dry figures." On the other 
hand, they are objective. In this respect, no verbal description 
can compete with them. As they say, you cannot add or take away 
anything. So of course it is interesting to see how the year 
1993 looks against the backdrop of the previous one. 
  The numeric picture of both years is painted in the short 
report by the Crimean State Committee on Statistics. As one 
should have expected, many data indicate the deepening of the 
socioeconomic crisis in our republic. 
  First, the demographic data. As of 1 January of this year, 
the population of Simferopol numbered 356,200, 
Sevastopol--374,400, Kerch--181,500, and Yevpatoriya--115,000. 
The urban population comprised 68.3 percent, and rural--31.7 
percent of the total. Men comprised 46.7 percent, and 
women--53.3 percent. 
  In 1992, the number of births was 28,400; last year--25,700; 
the number of deaths--29,800 and 32,600, respectively. Infant 
mortality increased. Blue- and white-collar workers numbered 
853,700 and 803,600 respectively; 100,500 and 95,200 persons 
worked on collective farms. 
  Industry decreased the output of most categories of 
products. 
The per capita output by year amounted to: electric power--327 
and 242 kW/hr; oil (including gas condensate)--7 and 5.8 kg; 
natural gas-- 188 and 187 cubic meters; iron ore--3.8 and 0 kg; 
mineral fertilizer--21.6 and 12.4 kg; sulfuric acid--95.6 and 
91.1 kg; cement--173 and 147 kg; meat--33.1 and 23.7 kg; 
butter--4.8 and 4.5 kg; whole milk products (recalculated as 
milk)--94.5 and 76.1 kg; canned food--240.2 and 204 standard 
cans; bread and bakery products--107.9 and 103 kg. 
  The situation in agriculture was grave. It was characterized 
by shortages of fodder for public animal husbandry, as well as 
fuels and lubricants, and price disproportions. The yield of 
grain over the last two years amounted to 32.9 and 27.3 quintals 
per hectare, respectively; corn for grain--37.5 and 30.6 
quintals; potatoes-- 137.5 and 138.6 quintals; and 
vegetables--143 and 132.9 quintals. 
  The livestock herd is declining. Horned cattle numbered, 
782,700 and 730,700 heads, respectively, , including 
cows--253,800 and 248,300. Swine numbered 427,800 and 370,000; 
sheep and goats 1,007,600 and 995,600; and horses 13,400 and 
13,600. 
  Production of agricultural output per capita of rural 
population amounted to 700.5 and 565.2 kg of grain, 140.4 and 
161 kg of potatoes, 56.1 and 48.8 kg of meat, 270.1 and 257.1 kg 
of milk, and 362 and 319 units of eggs. 
  The average wages of blue- and white-collar workers in the 
national economy amounted, respectively, to 5,690 and 131,503 
karbovantsy, and those of kolkhoz members--3,735 and 82,170 
karbovantsy. Of course, it is hard to judge the well-being of 
the population by these indicators, because the purchasing 
capacity of money is not the same--it declines quickly. In any 
case, last year prices grew faster than wages. 
  The State Committee on Statistics also provided us with 
figures on the average income level of workers in the national 
economy in April of the current year. It amounted to 879,200 
karbovantsy. The average wages in banking was 3,147,132 
karbovantsy; in air transportation--1,449,935; in 
construction--1,311,944, agriculture-- 470,542, and 
industry--975,601. As compared to March, the average wages in 
April increased by 6.6 percent.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Negotiations Are Over. The </F>
Negotiations Are Ahead"] 
  [Text] When the meeting between the delegations of the 
Crimean and Ukrainian Supreme Councils started, observers were 
convinced that representatives of the Crimean Parliament were 
fundamentally not ready to cooperate. According to one of the 
members of the Ukrainian delegation, the Crimeans saw nothing 
but military stratagem in all proposals on the part of the 
Kievans. This is not surprising though, since, among the 
participants in the negotiations on the Crimean side, only N. 
Bekyrov, a member of the Majlis, was not a military man, while 
the rest were colonels and lieutenant colonels, both in the 
active army service and retired. Notwithstanding that, following 
lengthy and difficult discussions that ended late in the evening 
on 3 June, the Kiev and Simferopol leaders reached an agreement 
and adopted a summing up document in which the sides "reached an 
understanding of the fact that the Constitution of the Crimean 
Republic adopted on 6 May 1992 contains some clauses, which do 
not conform to Ukrainian legislation, in particular, on the 
definition of the status of the Crimean Republic as an 
autonomous constituent part of Ukraine." In order to resolve 
the constitutional and legislative collision that had taken 
shape, the delegations favored the creation of a joint working 
group, which would, by 15 June, "advance proposals for 
coordinating the Constitution and legislation of the Crimean 
Republic with the Ukrainian Constitution." Both delegations 
appealed to President L. Kravchuk and called upon him not to 
introduce, until 15 June, the mechanism provided for by the 
corresponding Ukraine's Supreme Council decree and to Crimean 
President Yu. Meshkov and the local parliament not to take 
measures that might disrupt interaction between the state power 
bodies of Ukraine and the Crimea. 
  Just like in Simferopol, the negotiations in Sevastopol were 
also difficult. Russian and Ukrainian groups of experts on the 
Black Sea Fleet met there. However, certain progress was 
achieved there, too. According to Commander of Ukraine's Naval 
Forces Vice Admiral Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy, experts managed to 
specify the list of the Black Sea Fleet ships and vessels that 
will be allocated to each side after the division, even though 
the Russian representatives insisted that those ships and 
vessels that were given to Ukraine in 1991 as sailing means for 
military schools and had never been a part of the Black Sea 
Fleet be included in the general list. However, this problem 
could also be settled. The negotiations on the problems of 
dividing the Black Sea Fleet will continue at a higher level in 
Kiev on 8-9 June.

  [Text] Kiev ordered that the Crimean Military Commissariat 
stop sending Crimean conscripts to Sevastopol to perform their 
military service in the Black Sea Fleet, INTERFAX was told by an 
anonymous spokesman for the Crimean Military Commissariat in 
Simferopol. 
  He said that in 1994 the Crimea was to send 236 conscripts 
to 
the Black Sea Fleet. As of 1 June the Crimea sent 126 
conscripts. 
  The spokesman said that some of the conscripts from Crimea 
were sent to central and western parts of Ukraine. 
  On 20 May, the Crimean parliament took a decision according 
to which the Crimean Military Commissariat was ordered that the 
inhabitants of the Crimea undergo military service mainly on the 
peninsula. 
  At the same parliament session, the Crimean Military 
Commissar said that the Black Sea Fleet will not be able to 
accept all conscripts. 
  Commenting on the statement in an interview to INTERFAX, the 
head of the section responsible for the strength of the Black 
Sea Fleet said that the fleet is able to accept all men 
conscripted from the territory of the Crimea.

  [Text] A battalion of 350 Ukrainian guards has been 
transferred to Sevastopol from Simferopol in line with a decree 
issued by President Kravchuk in November of 1991. The National 
Guards Commander in Crimea Aleksandr Kostyukov explained the 
redeployment by the fact that an army compound has become vacant 
for the unit in the outskirts of Sevastopol. The armed guards 
have armored vehicles at their disposal. Their main task, in 
Kostyukov's words is to defend the Ukrainian constitutional 
system, its integrity and frontiers and to maintain public 
order. He stressed that there were no separate assignments for 
the battalion in Sevastopol. 
  Meanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Black Sea Naval 
Officers has sent to the Ukrainian president's ambassador in 
Sevastopol a letter, asking him on what legal grounds the 
battalion was brought into the city and for how long it would 
stay in the port. 
  Kostyukov also reported that there currently is a regiment 
of 
over 1000 guards in Crimea's capital Simferopol.

following the withdrawal of nuclear weapons, the Ukrainian army 
will be equipped with high-precision weapons, which are not 
weapons of mass destruction. 
  He told the cadets of the Zhitomir military school that 
Ukraine, Russia, the U.S. and other countries were working on 
this type of weapon. 
  The acquisition of high-precision weapons is provided for in 
the Ukrainian military doctrine, approved by the Ukrainian

  [Text] Ternopol [no dateline as received] -- Meeting the 
local electorate on 7 June, Leonid Kuchma, presidential 
candidate and leader of the Ukrainian Union of Industrialists 
and Entrepreneurs, was accused of looking to "the Northern 
neighbor" and trying to "pull Ukraine back into Moscow's 
bondage." The candidate replied: "I have never, not even in my 
sleep, ever said anywhere to anyone anything about a political 
union with Russia. As for economic ties, ask people on the shop 
floor, would they reject that?" 
  Meanwhile, Kuchma said he opposed Ukraine's accession to the 
ruble zone: "This would lead to loss of sovereignty." He spoke 
in favor of strong authority which world practice had proven to 
be the only force capable of implementing economic reforms. 
"Only one person should take the responsibility," he added. 
"That's why if I win I will initially act as prime minister as 
well as perform full presidential duties."

<F P=106> [Speech by Ukrainian Supreme Council Chairman O. Moroz at </F>
the Supreme Council Session on 31 May 1994] 
  [Text] Esteemed deputies. We have completed an extremely 
difficult and unspectacular portion of deputy functions -- the 
forming of the Supreme Council's working bodies. They have for 
the most part been formed and their heads elected. 
  Despite all the hardships that we endured in the recent days 
we have managed to take a step toward a totally different 
democratic structuring of the Supreme Council that accounts for 
the actual multiparty nature of society's political sphere. We 
have laid the foundation for the Supreme Council's steadiness, 
which gives hope that deputies will have no time for political 
feuds. On the one hand, the makeup of the commissions does not 
allow for deviating toward conflicts. On the other hand, the 
burden of responsibility for the performance of official duties 
and the observance of commitments for the electorate will demand 
accord and compromises at all the stages of the lawmaking 
process. 
  Of course there is hardly a deputy in the session hall who 
would like the entire presidium. This is good, for it is a 
confirmation of the high potential of the session hall, a 
reserve of this potential. This does not close the road toward 
the improvement of the council's working bodies. 
  In recent days, after we made a mistake at the beginning, we 
realized the importance of the procedure. Had we spent three 
days discussing the regulations, this would have saved us two 
weeks. 
  I believe that now hardly anyone has doubts regarding the 
necessity to discuss regulations so that once a quality draft is 
prepared by the commissions, we pass it approximately within a 
month, and never resume the tactics of political battles in 
which there can be no winner. 
  On what should we concentrate our efforts in the near 
future? 
I repeat, do not consider this lingering. A wise start is a 
guarantee of a successful finish. 
  First, we have to complete the manning of commissions soon, 
as stipulated by the temporary regulations that we passed and 
the statute of groups and factions. We must select specialists 
among commission members for the division of functions within 
the commissions and the forming of their bodies. No one should 
be afraid of a situation where a commission comprises only one 
specialist, for you have the right to engage specialists who are 
not deputies. The main issue is to make good use of their 
knowledge, patriotic feelings, and healthy ambitions. I think 
that the Supreme Council leadership will provide the best 
material and technical conditions. 
  Second, all the commissions should meticulously plan their 
work and envision in their plans urgent, long-range, and 
perspective goals. This should be done approximately in a week 
-- drafts approved in the commissions, and, by means of the 
secretariat, passed over to one of the legal commissions for 
generalizing and forming a kind of genealogy of the legislative 
process, approval by the presidium, the coordinating council, 
and the session. 
  I believe it appropriate to entrust one of the deputy 
chairmen with organizing this work and exercising control over 
it. 
  Third, urgent tasks should be regarded as supplements to the 
already determined issues and placed on each deputy's desk by 
next Tuesday's session. 
  A large group of urgent issues is comprised of laws that 
regulate economic relations. It would take much time to simply 
enumerate these. We should unblock production and create normal 
conditions for the functioning of enterprises through taxes, 
credits, investments, and currency regulations. We must protect 
the people from further growth of prices, the threat of mass 
unemployment, the decline in wages, unavailability of goods and 
transport, impossibility of providing for their own and their 
children's summer vacations. 
  Complex problems arise with regard to preparation for 
harvesting and quite soon for the winter as well. 
  However if we turn into a "fire brigade" again, then, 
despite 
all attempts to professionally resolve emerging problems, our 
efficiency will be minimal, because we will face unresolved 
strategic problems every time. I will take the liberty of 
reminding you that in accordance with Clause 6 of Article 97 of 
the Ukrainian Constitution, it lies within our jurisdiction, the 
jurisdiction of the Ukrainian Supreme Council to determine the 
principles of state regulation and social development in Ukraine. 
  This is currently our primary and most important task. Only 
under the condition of this issue's positive resolution can we 
hope to stimulate the deputies' productive work, clear the 
existing legislative field, and create a solid footing for 
stabilizing Ukraine's economy and launching actual reform. Only 
a complex of well-planned, purposeful, interrelated measures 
will facilitate a civilized resolution of the most acute 
problems in our lives -- resume the work of our enterprises, 
simultaneously stimulating their structural and technological 
reshaping; put tax and credit policies in order and free 
entrepreneurs, mediators, and banks from the criminal 
environment; improve our currency regulations and encourage an 
increase in the state's export potential; put in order imports; 
support the creation of a reliable monetary-financial system, 
without which there can be no market reform of which to speak. 
  Then we will be able to meet all other demands of our 
electors -- index all their savings (we will have to pass an 
appropriate law prior to this); provide for people's large-scale 
participation in privatization; fix low prices for textbooks 
designated for schools and higher educational institutions, as 
well as for children's nutrition at kindergartens, summer camps, 
sanatoria, and schools; and finally, reimburse expenditures on 
burying the dead. These and a number of other burning social 
measures must be taken this year. We should expeditiously 
prepare a legal footing for this. 
  We are going to take these steps not for the sake of 
populism, not to put a new patch on an old one. We are going to 
target our reform toward a social orientation, make it 
inevitable, all-encompassing and able to serve the interests of 
the people of Ukraine. 
  This goal was set for the people drafting "The Basic 
Principles of the State Regulation of Ukraine's Economic and 
Social Development." Several groups of scientists, economists, 
and managers have intensively worked on this document over the 
last couple of months. The work is to be completed this week 
and it would be good if the document could be passed to the 
Supreme Council next week. Other options should also be 
discussed. I know how the groups of deputies, represented in 
this hall, worked; I am more or less familiar with their work, 
and believe that it is very interesting and useful. We should 
also hear a report on the results of their work. These results 
may help coordinate various aspects of understanding certain 
issues. They may also be regarded as alternative plans. We 
should submit to indepth analysis the long- range plans 
regarding the activities of the Cabinet of Ministers. Those 
plans exist and they are quite interesting. I had a talk with 
the acting prime minister yesterday; he is ready to submit those 
proposals (drafted earlier) for discussion by the Supreme 
Council. 
  It will be logical to form the new government and elect the 
new prime minister following adoption of this document. However 
this is not connected with presidential elections and thus, 
there is neither the need nor the time for a delay. After we 
have realized and adopted strategic directions that correspond 
to the Ukrainian people's system of values (given that the 
people have empowered us to protect their interests), we will 
choose a prime minister to implement this course, and approve 
his candidacy here at the session. 
  Through the prism of this strategy we will assess the 
government's program and our numerous laws -- both the existing 
ones and those that will be drafted. Such conscious constructive 
work by the Supreme Council will indubitably produce positive 
results and will be properly assessed by the people of Ukraine. 
  We, both participants and observers, should quietly respond 
to all kinds of feuds within the Supreme Council. We should not 
stray from the painstaking creative work; we will later sort 
things out among ourselves. The Supreme Council must not be 
discredited; incidentally, such discredit amounts to paying bad 
service to President Kravchuk. Those who fail to understand 
this are actually blocking vital reforms, encouraging the 
continuation of the looting and selling of our state, the 
impoverishment of a majority of people and the strengthening of 
the existing parasitic groups. 
  I am convinced that a majority of deputies will support the 
proposals regarding the organization of such work in 
commissions, constituencies, and at plenary sessions. 
  From a perspective of strategic tasks we should consider a 
number of national programs toward which foreign investors have 
displayed interest. Supreme Council commissions should acquaint 
themselves with these programs and determine their role in 
speeding up the implementation of the latter. 
  Among the entire range of these issues I would single out 
two 
groups that warrant special attention. 
  One of them is the coordination of the acting laws to 
facilitate their normal functioning. For instance, a series of 
laws on enterprises and entrepreneurship have been distorted by 
sublaws, norms, and departmental instructions. The same 
concerns laws on land relationship, lease, privatization, 
freedom of thought, and especially laws on local administration 
and the forming of vertical structures in the administrative 
branch. The budget issue also belongs here and cannot be 
postponed any further. We are completing the second quarter of 
1994 without an approved budget. 
  Fourth, we will not be able to avoid resolving urgent 
current 
tasks, which will partially ruin the legislative system. I mean 
issues like the Crimea, preparations for the elections, and the 
formation of the Cabinet of Ministers. Thus those are the 
issues that will have to be discussed simultaneously. 
  Fifth, we should step up control activities of the Supreme 
Council's working bodies, demanding that the provisions of laws 
and resolutions be unconditionally observed. 
  I know that this stance is different from that of some 
deputies. This has been said on television and discussed here in 
the session hall. However no group of 10 deputies, even 
comprising the best lawyers, will be able to provide control 
over the efficiency of certain laws. This can be done solely by 
all the deputies working in the commissions, and performing a 
control function to the extent envisioned for the given 
commission. For special cases we can set up deputies' groups on 
a different basis. Everybody will then understand that one 
should not only draft laws but also control their observance. 
  I repeat once again -- this is every commission's business, 
however, general coordination and analysis of this work should 
be supervised, I presume, by [Deputy Chairman] Oleksandr 
Tkachenko. At the initial stage we should analyze how the 
privatization program, passed by the Supreme Council, was being 
implemented after its adoption and has been implemented in 1994. 
This is the basic issue of reform and that is why the general 
outcome of privatization, in particular the leasing of property, 
would be interesting to both the Supreme Council, as the owner 
of national wealth, and to every citizen. We should also 
receive precise information regarding the use of money acquired 
through privatization, the privatization of partially 
constructed facilities (as compared to the general volume of 
privatization), and determine the state's profits. 
  I believe that discussion of this issue in a month or so 
would facilitate the specification of the program and the 
mechanism for such change in ownership relations. 
  The Commission for Deputy Ethics, along with the 
Administrative Office and the secretariat should help establish 
the normal work of bodies and individual deputies in Kiev and in 
the constituencies. Completion of the selection of advisers, the 
scientific-methodological and material provision of the 
lawmaking process -- everything should be organized for the 
deputies to realize that their desire to be absorbed in work 
meets with both understanding and a responsible attitude on the 
part of all the services and officials, no matter where the 
latter are employed. This, undoubtedly, primarily concerns the 
appropriate services of the Supreme Council, and these will be 
requested to treat deputies' work in an appropriate manner. 
  You should not consider this dilettantism. We must initiate 
the collective work of all the Supreme Council structures, 
wisely task all the deputies, so that everybody, including the 
state, sees the results of our work. 
  Excuse your opponents' harsh words and claims. Good luck!

<F P=106> ["Excerpt" from speech by Ukrainian President Leonid </F>
Kravchuk at the Ukrainian Supreme Council plenary session in 
Kiev on 2 June 1994] 
  [Text] Esteemed people's deputies! 
  In my address to the Supreme Council, to you, I outlined my 
arguments regarding the June elections. Today, as well as 
yesterday, while analyzing the debate held here, I had the 
impression that the emphasis was only on the first argument, 
namely, the one concerning the need to postpone the elections. 
However, another important argument, that if the Supreme 
Council adopts appropriate laws, clarifications, the elections 
will have to be held, was not analyzed. I am not calling from 
this rostrum not to hold the elections. I have said, and I am 
still saying, and my viewpoint is that the elections should be 
held. They should be held, however, only if the legislative 
basis is adjusted to them. This is my position, and it is based 
on my conviction that otherwise we will completely lose control 
over the authorities. 
  If the elections are held without changing and amending the 
Constitution and laws, if the powers of local authorities are 
not precisely defined, we will have an uncontrolled situation, a 
total disarray of the Executive Branch. This is not simply a 
threat, but based on the experience of happened in 1990. 
Regarding the presidential office, it was introduced not simply 
because someone wanted it, but because the situation demanded 
it. This is first. 
  Second, if you carefully read the law on reforming local 
authorities and self-government, adopted by the previous Supreme 
Council, you will find a definition of the presidential office. 
I recall how your predecessors were cleansing this law, and how 
they did not want that such an office exist. 
  Suddenly, later, there was talk that the president must be 
elected. 
  Thus, I am asking you one simple and clear question: If this 
law entrusts the government with everything, what role is 
assigned to the president? 
  If the president is elected universally with these powers, 
and I see that there will be no other case, we will have in Kiev 
the president, the head of the state and the head of the 
executive authority, and we will lack of any presidential 
influence in the regions. 
  I am saying this to coordinate these issues. 
  If the Supreme Council really wants Ukraine to remain an 
independent, manageable, sovereign, and democratic state, as has 
been stated here, then, while adopting the resolution regarding 
the 26 June elections, or confirming it, the parliament must 
assume responsibility for preparation and adoption of the 
appropriate documents by 26 June. This should be written down 
in a resolution, the draft of which envisions that documents 
defining, in particular, the powers of the Ukrainian president, 
will be submitted by 12 June. 
  The powers of the Ukrainian president are defined by the 
Constitution, and you will not change them by any law, whether 
you want this or not. The Constitution must be changed. Is 
this realistically possible? If such a possibility do exist, 
let us do that. I support this. Moreover, I was the first to 
support a clear division of powers. The draft constitution, at 
my proposal, was amended with this very provision concerning the 
division of powers of the head of state and the head of 
Executive Branch. Yet, this must now be added to the current 
Constitution. 
  I would therefore like to refute any insinuations that 
someone wants to preserve himself in office, that the president 
signed the electoral law alone. But after that, the president 
submitted to the Supreme Council draft legislation concerning 
reorganization of governmental power. 
  You, speaking from this rostrum, insisted that it was not 
expedient to adopt them. Everything was written down clearly: 
Who is the president, what is the government, what is the 
judicial authority, and what is the Supreme Council. Nobody 
would have played a game of war anymore. You did not want it! 
A very interesting thesis recently appeared: Apparently, there 
is only one thing to be done, the law has to be changed that an 
oblast head be elected by deputies, and seemingly, everything 
will be fine. 
  But I am asking you, if an oblast head is elected by 
deputies, will the government be able to dismiss him? No. Will 
the president be able to do that? No. I have currently three 
times as much power vis-a-vis the Crimean president, as the 
newly elected president will have regarding an oblast or rayon 
head. 
  I am asking these questions, being led by my current 
feelings. Someone does not like the president standing here. I 
would like the president to be elected without ruining the state 
and the executive authority, that he be elected legitimately, 
consistently, and without insinuations that, apparently, we are 
currently resorting to legal cases because, apparently, people 
want this. Tomorrow, when everything collapses, the same people 
will come here, to the Supreme Council, and they will say that 
there are no pensions and other things, because there will be no 
money for the budget. Who will answer these questions and how? 
  I am saying, if we are to establish authorities, if are to 
establish new authorities, then let us establish it in a manner 
enabling it to work. 
  I repeat, the authority we are to elect will not work, and 
if 
it does work, it will have no control, given these laws. I do 
not want to be a prophet, as the saying goes, "in my own 
fatherland," but you will see a situation within a certain 
period. You will see and then speak out. Thus, I want us to 
approach this issue in a responsible manner. 
  If the Supreme Council drafts the appropriate laws, if it 
places all emphasis on the law adopted by your predecessors, 
there will be no doubt: I will support the elections, I will 
support holding such elections. 
  Thus, my position on the local elections is clear. 
  Here is my second position, on the presidential election. 
The current status of the president is defined in the 
Constitution. If the president is elected according to this, 
then, believe me, no Supreme Council will be able to strip him 
of any power after he goes through all that torment. There is 
talk that these issues can be resolved in a referendum. This is 
interesting logic. We will first elect the president with 
powers in June, and in September we will hold a referendum on 
the question of which powers should we take away from him. So, 
what do we finally want? We only want to voice slogans. This 
is unrealistic. 
  Once again, I am calling on you, for you will bear the 
greatest responsibility. I want everyone to know that, because 
the presidential campaign has already begun. I am a 
presidential candidate, you were elected by the people. There 
is a legitimate, constitutional Supreme Council, though 
incomplete, since a third of deputies are not here, 9 million 
voters are not represented in the Supreme Council. 
Nevertheless, you are the legitimate, constitutional Supreme 
Council, and you bear the greatest responsibility for a way we 
will form the government. History must know of this. What sort 
of government we will form is the exclusive provenance of the 
Supreme Council. Any political passions, any insinuations -- 
who wants what and how -- must be rejected if we really love 
Ukraine. 
  I want us to establish strong executive authorities, 
legitimate legislative authorities, and the president with 
precise and clear powers. If we do that, there will be a need 
to go to the polls on 26 June. It does not matter who will win. 
I have never objected to that.

  [Text] Kiev 8 June -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk 
confirmed on Wednesday that he has not changed his mind to run 
for presidency in the presidential elections to be held on 26 
June. 
  "Many good things have been done during my presidency," 
Kravchuk told ITAR-TASS. He admitted, however, that there were 
also mistakes, both subjective and objective. 
  "If I do not embark on the path of building and 
strengthening 
the state and pursuing the course of peace and accord, I would 
not be able to tell the people and myself why I did not do what 
I could," he continued. 
  "That's why the participation in the elections is the 
continuation of my desire to do everything possible so that 
Ukraine could continue to develop," Kravchuk said.

  [Text] Comrat, BASAPRESS, 6/6/1994 -- Turkish President 
Suleyman Demirel's visit to Comrat and Ceadar-Lunga districts is 
of historic importance. He was the first Turkish president to 
visit the region inhabited by Gagauzians, stated to BASA Stepan 
Topal, president of the self-proclaimed Gagauz Republic. 
According to him, "this visit will strongly foster Gagauzians' 
national rebirth in many areas as well as the parliamentary 
settlement of the problem regarding Gagauzians' 
self-determination." The credit worth $32 million, which Turkey 
granted Moldova to develop the Southern districts will 
accelerate the social-economic development of these districts, 
said Topal.

  [Text] [Correspondent] Lt-Gen Vardiko Nadibaidze, minister 
of defense of the Republic of Georgia, held a news conference 
devoted to issues relating to the building of a regular national 
army. 
  In the opinion of the minister, the Georgian Army should be 
mobile and small, numbering between 10,000 to 15,000 people. A 
military doctrine on army construction is to be examined by the 
Defense Ministry Collegium in the next few days. 
  Regarding the Defense Ministry, its administrative apparatus 
should be reduced by 50 percent. Savings resulting from this 
reduction should be used to help soldiers, veterans of the 
Abkhazian war, and the families of the war dead. It was said at 
the news conference that special consideration would be given to 
problems facing servicemen who had returned from Abkhazia. The 
minister decided to meet each serviceman individually and find 
out in person what kind of assistance they need. 
  The minister stressed that everything must be done to create 
normal conditions of military service for soldiers. The 
provision of food for soldiers and other routine problems they 
must deal with every day should be addressed from the center. 
  On the issue of the military police, the defense minister 
recalled how selflessly its members fought in the Abkhazian war 
and said it had been reorganized to take on the new duties of 
[word indistinct]. A new system of military police service is 
to be introduced. 
  Georgian Defense Minister Vardiko Nadibaidze discussed the 
deployment of Russian peacekeeping troops in Abkhazia, stressing 
that the security zone had become considerably wider [as heard]. 
It was decided the joint headquarters of peacekeeping troops 
will be based in Sukhumi. There will be two more headquarters, 
one in Gali and another in Zugdidi. 
  In connection with the current situation in Gali Rayon, the 
defense minister stated the following: 
  [Begin Nadibaidze recording, in Russian] The situation has 
stabilized. I am receiving reports from there literally every 
day. Gen Kurashvili, who is the commander in charge of that 
direction, returned from there today. No deterioration in the 
situation has been registered there. The situation is stable 
and everyone is anticipating the introduction of peacekeeping 
forces. [end recording] 
  [Correspondent] At the end of the news conference, Lt-Gen 
Vardiko Nadibaidze said he regards as extremely important a 
visit to Georgia by Russian Defense Grachev, who is to arrive in 
Tbilisi tomorrow.

  [Text] Visiting Sweden's Prime Minister Carl Bildt on 
Wednesday pledged aid to nuclear fuel removal from a former 
Soviet nuclear training base at Paldiski in north west Estonia 
saying obstacles to be passed in order to start with the process 
were of political, not technical nature. 
  "We have some possibilities of helping," Bild told the press 
after visiting the reactors together with his Estonian 
counterpart. Bildt said that prospective aid included both 
technical and social assistance referring to aid to residents 
who might want to leave Paldiski. He did not, however, specify 
the amount of resources Sweden was willing to allocate for that 
purpose. 
  Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar also said that technically 
everything was ready for the removal and Russia only had to pass 
a decision on starting dismantling of the reactors. 
  "Technically, everything is ready and we could see that with 
our own eyes," Laar said while adding that the date remained 
uncertain as even the head of the Russian training centre in 
Paldiski, Admiral Aleksandr Olkhovikov, could not tell the exact 
date. 
  Bildt expressed hope that dismantling would be started 
within 
a couple of weeks adding that, fortunately, his fears on high 
radiation near to reactors had proved groundless. 
  On answering the question on Russian military pensioners, 
the 
issue where Latvia made concessions to Russia, Bildt said he had 
discussed it at his meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev in St. Petersburg in early May saying Latvia and 
Estonia were completely different and that Estonia could not 
copy Latvia. 
  "... any agreement that must be reached must be reached 
within the framework of Estonian legislation," Bild said. 
  Talking on prospective troop pullout, Bildt said: "That will 
be a very important day to Europe, because the Russians will be 
leaving Germany, they will be leaving Latvia and, of course, 
they must leave Estonia as well." 
  Bildt also met President Lennart Meri expressing his 
country's support to unconditional troop pullout by August 31 
deadline. Foreign Minister Juri Luik also attended the meeting.

<F P=106> [Report by Stas Stremidlovskiy: "`Skokov Is Real "Shadow" </F>
Prime Minister Whom I Always Seemed To Have in Mind' (Boris 
Yeltsin, `President's Notes')"] 
  [Text] Informed sources in the Russian Government and in 
Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin's entourage report 
that the question of Viktor Chernomyrdin's resignation for 
health reasons from the post of prime minister and the 
appointment of Yuriy Skokov to this post has been resolved in 
principle. Viktor Stepanovich himself allegedly agrees with 
this formulation. And that is obviously what explains 
Chernomyrdin's unexpected departure to Germany, where he 
underwent investigation and a course of treatment for a kidney 
stone illness. 
  According to unofficial reports, last Monday Boris Yeltsin 
had already had a meeting with Yuriy Skokov as a result of which 
only Boris Yeltsin's signature is lacking to the necessary draft 
presidential edicts. 
  Yuriy Skokov is now public chairman of the federation of 
Russian commodity producers and entrepreneurs and before that he 
held the post of Security Council secretary, and since October 
1992 has engaged in earnest in the affairs of the regions, where 
he has acquired considerable popularity. 
  Yuriy Skokov tries not to expatiate on his political 
activity, calling himself a "politically homeless person." His 
recent contacts have included those with people from the 
entourage of Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov and leaders of the "New 
Regional Policy" deputies' group. In addition, Yuriy Skokov did 
not sign the "Social Accord Treaty," which put him on a par with 
Communist Party leader Gennadiy Zyuganov and Agrarian Party 
leader Mikhail Lapshin. 
  So far we can only guess whether Boris Yeltsin will appoint 
Skokov as acting head of the cabinet or will try to submit his 
candidacy to the Federal Assembly for approval as a full prime 
minister. 
  In the opinion of a number of experts, the decision to 
appoint Yuriy Skokov was prompted by the fact that the Russian 
parliament is ceasing to be controlled by the president. A 
parliamentary majority has not been successfully formed on the 
basis of the democratic parties in the State Duma. The 
Federation Council has also proved disobedient. That was shown 
by the situation involving the approval of Aleksandr Ilyushenko 
for the post of general prosecutor. 
  Therefore, experts believe, it is most likely that Yuriy 
Skokov, in exchange for his appointment as head of government, 
has promised Boris Yeltsin to ensure the passage of presidential 
draft edicts in the State Duma. If you consider that Skokov 
recently signed an agreement on cooperation with the State Duma 
"New Regional Policy" deputies' group, which includes 65 
deputies, he will obviously be able to fulfill that promise.

  [Text] It is known that Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin interrupted his holiday in Sochi and flew to 
Germany on Sunday to undergo a medical investigation for kidney 
stones. Chernomyrdin's trip to Germany appears to be a rather 
strange one, if one takes into account the fact that the best 
medical institutions in Russia are located in the resort where 
he was vacationing, Reuters considers. 
  It was reported by the DPA agency that all the experts 
examined Chernomyrdin and acknowledged his state of health as 
excellent. 
  According to a correspondent of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, the 
question arises as to whether the unexpected trip to Germany by 
Chernomyrdin is window-dressing preparation for his resignation 
due to the state of his health. 
  It is interesting that, according to a report from Russia's 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, people surrounding First Deputy 
Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets have unambiguously given it to be 
understood that their boss may soon become prime minister. 
  Another probable candidate for the post of head of 
government 
is Yuriy Skokov, chairman of the Federation of Goods' Producers. 
  This is what KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA writes. According to 
reports from informed sources in the government of Russia, the 
issue of the resignation of Viktor Chernomyrdin from the post of 
prime minister due to his state of health and the appointment of 
Yuriy Skokov has fundamentally been decided among those 
surrounding Boris Yeltsin. Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin 
himself allegedly agrees with this formulation. According to 
unofficial information, Yeltsin already met with Yuriy Skokov 
last Monday, as a result of which the necessary draft 
presidential decrees only need to have Yeltsin's signature added 
to them.

  [Text] Moscow June 9 ITAR-TASS -- "Allegations about Viktor 
Chernomyrdin's resignation are an invention and a lie from 
beginning to end," the Russian president's press secretary 
Vyacheslav Kostikov announced today. 
  The press secretary reacted to a report in the KOMSOMOLSKAYA 
PRAVDA daily, which cited "informed sources in the country's 
leadership" as saying that "the question about Viktor 
Chernomyrdin's resignation from the post of prime minister for 
reasons of health has been decided in principle, as has the 
appointment of Yuriy Skokov to the post". 
  The report said "Viktor Chernomyrdin has reportedly agreed 
with the formula, which accounts for his unexpected departure 
for Germany for medical examination and treatment for 
nephrolithiasis". 
  The newspaper cited unofficial data about the president's 
meeting with Yuriy Skokov last Monday, "as a result of which, 
the relevant draft presidential decrees are awaiting Boris 
Yeltsin's signature". 
  Yuriy Skokov is the chairman of the federation of commodity 
producers and entrepreneurs of Russia. Earlier, he was 
secretary of the Security Council and since October 1992 was 
closely involved with the affairs of the regions, where he won 
considerable popularity, KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA reported.

  [Text] The pressure on Chechnya by Russia can seriously 
aggravate the situation in the North Caucasus and result in 
widescale armed clashes, believes Chechen President Dzhokhar 
Dudayev. "The policy pursued by Russia has absolutely no 
prospects and can lead to a global military confrontation 
between Russia and the Caucasus which can finally develop into a 
new Russian-Caucasian war," Dudayev declared in his interview 
with Interfax. 
  As Dudayev asserts, young people from other North Caucasian 
republic who are concerned over the worsening situation around 
Chechnya are coming to Groznyy. In Dudayev's words, they 
express their wish to serve in the armed forces of the Chechen 
republic. 
  Being interviewed by Interfax the day before, Sergey 
Filatov, 
head of the president's administration, accused Dudayev, who has 
repeatedly voiced sharp anti-Russian statements, of actual 
disruption of the negotiating process between Moscow and 
Groznyy. Having recognized that Dudayev possesses the real power 
in Chechnya, Filatov expressed his hope that the Russian-Chechen 
dialogue would be resumed in the near term.

  [Text] Paris June 8 TASS -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev met with U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown in Paris 
on Wednesday to discuss bilateral cooperation between Russia and 
the United States. 
  The meeting was part of the preparations for a session of 
the 
Russian-U.S. joint commission on trade and scientific and 
technical cooperation to be held in Washington. The commission 
is co-chaired by Russian Prime Minister viktor chernomyrdin and 
U.S. Vice President Al Gore. 
  The Russian side calls for the soonest possible elimination 
of the vestiges of the Cold War hampering business partnership 
between Russia and the United States, Kozyrev's adviser Galina 
Sidorova said. 
  There are grounds to believe that these barriers may be 
removed by the United States in the near future. For its part 
the united States stressed the need to streamline customs 
tariffs and taxes in Russia. The two sides expressed the hope 
that Russia will create a favourable climate for foreign 
investors. 
  Kozyrev also met with Japanese Government representative 
Nobuo Matsunaga to discuss the situation on the Korean 
peninsula. Kozyrev pointed out that the world community should 
first use diplomatic means, including an international meeting, 
to solve the nuclear problem before imposing sanctions on North 
Korea.

<F P=106> [Report by Viktor Litovkin: "`American' Behaved Impudently"] </F>
  [Text] As the electronic mass media have already reported, 
on 7 June fighters from the Russian air defense forces forced a 
Lockheed C-130 aircraft belonging to the United States which had 
violated Russian air space to land at Adler Airport (Sochi). 
  Colonel General Viktor Prudnikov, commander in chief of the 
Russian air defense forces, confirmed this report. he said that 
the U.S. transport aircraft was detected by forces under his 
command at 1328 hours Moscow time in the center of the Black 
Sea. It was flying at an altitude of 6,000 meters in the 
direction of Russian territory. At a distance of 100 km from 
the country's state border the crew, as stipulated under 
international rules, was warned of the potential violation and 
was asked for its destination and flight course. 
  The "American" was silent. 
  The duty officers at the South Russian air defense command 
point put the reserve forces under their subordination on combat 
alert and reported the incident to the center, asking it to 
ascertain the situation, but the center knew nothing about this 
flight. It was not on the plan, no one had asked our 
specialists for air corridors. Moreover, the crew of the U.S. 
aircraft did not respond to signals from our central command 
point and, continuing to fly along its former course, was 
already 80 km inside Russian air space. 
  The air defense command decided to ban the Lockheed aircraft 
crew from flying over our territory. A flight of Su-27 fighter 
interceptors took off. 
  At the Russian Defense Ministry information and press 
directorate we were told that the Russian air defense forces 
fighters did not come any closer than 50 km to the U.S. 
aircraft. Nonetheless the foreign crew was warned that unless it 
fulfilled the orders from our military, prescribed by 
international rules, "the forces on duty would take action" 
against it. 
  IZVESTIYA was told by Colonel General Prudnikov, commander 
in 
chief of the air defense forces, that "the U.S. aircraft was 
forced to land." It made the landing at 1410 hours Moscow time 
at Adler civilian airport. 
  Russian competent organs have established that the Lockheed 
C-130 aircraft was intended to service the U.S. diplomatic 
missions in the Caucasus. It was flying from Frankfurt-am-Main 
(FRG) to Tbilisi. 
  The crew was unable to explain why it had violated our 
border. 
  After all the charges had been explained and the necessary 
documents had been compiled the crew was given permission to 
take off and at 1745 hours they left Russian territory. 
  First Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin has, as we 
know, made a statement to Thomas Pickering, the U.S. ambassador 
in Russia, in connection with this incident. 
  Ambassador Pickering has promised to inform the U.S. 
leadership of the incident immediately and thanked the deputy 
minister for the fact that the Russian military did not shoot 
down the aircraft. 
  Circles close to the Russian Defense Ministry leadership 
have 
called the Lockheed crew's behavior "impudent." 
  Indeed, each day at Russia's Northern and Eastern borders, 
in 
direct proximity to its borderline, there are five or seven U.S. 
combat aircraft loitering on the verge of a "foul," carrying out 
surveillance and on combat duty, and, of course, keeping the 
Russian air defense duty forces in a state of heightened tension. 
  Our aircraft have not flown close to U.S. shores for a long 
time and do not come close to U.S. state borders. The Russian 
military believe that this situation does not help to strengthen 
the trust we so need.

<F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM correspondent Aleksey Trotsenko for </F>
TASS] 
  [Excerpts] Kiev 9 June TASS -- Ukraine and North Korea 
signed a consular convention and several other inter-state 
agreements on Wednesday [8 June]. 
  North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam who is on an 
official visit in Ukraine and his Ukrainian counterpart Anatoliy 
Zlenko also signed a protocol on consultations between the 
Ukrainian and North Korean foreign ministries. 
  After the signing ceremony Kim Yong-nam met with journalists 
to answer their questions. 
  He said that his talks with Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk, Deputy Parliamentary Chairman Aleksandr Tkachenko and 
Foreign Minister Zlenko helped him understand better the 
processes going on in Ukraine. 
  Speaking about the nuclear problem, the minister stressed 
that it is "artificial. It was created by certain circles in 
the U.S. and IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) in order 
to strangle socialism in the country." "The nuclear crisis on 
the peninsular must be solved by the United States and North 
Korea through negotiations," he said. [passage omitted] 
  He emphasised that the peaceful settlement of the conflict 
will largely depend on the successful outcome of the talks with 
the United Nations and IAEA. He expressed regret that the first 
two rounds of talks did not bring the desired results and noted 
that North Korea pins hopes on the third round. [passage omitted] 
  Asked about what nuclear weapons North Korea could afford 
today, Kim Yong-nam replied that "we have no any nuclear 
weapons. Moreover, we have neither possibilities, nor equipment, 
nor funds to make them." 
  Speaking about prospects for reunification with South Korea, 
the minister said that only peaceful reunification is possible, 
without interference of other countries. The two countries 
should form a confederation, while preserving their systems and 
governments, he said.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS analyst Vladimir Gondusov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow 8 June TASS -- While Russian, Ukrainian and 
Crimean politicians are busy debating the fate of the Crimean 
peninsula and of the Black Sea Fleet based there, Ukrainian 
nationalists are acting to destabilise the situation in the 
region. 
  Groups of volunteers from the Ukrainian National Assembly 
(UNA- UNSO) [Ukrainian National Self-Defense] are reportedly 
getting ready for a massive landing in the Crimea on 17 June, 
causing alarm not only in the Crimean capital of Simferopol but 
also in Ukraine's Kiev. 
  Assistant to the president of the Republic of Crimea Aleksey 
Baksheyev said the threats of Ukrainian nationalists are quite 
substantial. He told ITAR-TASS that he did not rule out the 
possibility that some of the groups had already penetrated the 
peninsula and added that he has information about the possible 
activity of the nationalists among the population. 
  Aleksey Baksheyev's information about the possible acts of 
provocation in the Crimea is confirmed by the press centre of 
the Black Sea Fleet. The centre on Wednesday circulated 
information about forming a volunteer group for "an active 
recreation" in the Crimea by the nationalist forces in Lvov. 
The volunteers intend to "propagate the ideas of Ukrainian 
statehood and nationalism in the peninsula." Tens of 
self-styled "propagandists" will be accommodated in the 
recreation centres around Alushta. They travel to the peninsula 
with vouchers worth 2.5 million karbovanets, 90 percent of the 
price being paid by the UNA-UNSO organisation. 
  The UNA-UNSO volunteers include many people with warfare 
experience acquired in the flashpoints of the Commonwealth, 
including Transdniestria. As concerns their motives, they said 
it was primarily the desire "to protect the interests of the 
Ukrainians residing in the Crimea." 
  Sources in the Crimea said that Lvov nationalists are the 
most active in choosing the Crimea for "summer vacationing". 
But groups of nationalists are being formed also in other 
regions of Ukraine. Their advance guards are already in the 
peninsula, where they arrived in pairs or individually in order 
to avoid provoking suspicions. Their task is to reconnoiter and 
prepare for the arrival of the main force. 
  Deputies of the Ukrainian and Crimean parliaments told 
ITAR-TASS that they were against such moves. In their view, 
against the background of positive developments in the 
negotiating process involving Moscow, Kiev and Simferopol, 
nationalist activity can only build up more tension but is 
unable to exert any positive influence on the situation.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 10 (ITAR-TASS) -- "Historians and 
politicians will probably describe the epoch we are living 
through, as a period of `minor stagnation'," the NEZAVISIMAYA 
GAZETA writes. 
  "Apathy and indifference to the present-day developments are 
rapidly spreading to growing numbers of Russians. They are 
losing respect for any form of power: for the reformer 
president, for `tough economically-minded' premier and for 
legislators who now know `their place' well. 
  "What can be expected after the end of the summer interval 
in 
the Russian political life? According to the most optimistic 
forecasts, both politics and economy will gradually sink into a 
state of stagnation which can continue for long months. 
  "The president will pay no attention to permanent 
parliamentary wrangles and the government -- to trade union 
ultimatums and pickets. If such a situation will stabilise, it 
may turn advantageous (due to some reasons) for most political 
forces. Nobody will want to take the risk of upsetting the 
balance." 
  The same newspaper writes the following in another article: 
"Everyone sees now the vital need for setting up a `flexible' 
centre for pooling all social democrats and socialists to 
exchange information and for discussions. 
  "Mikhail Gorbachev's participation would be also desirable 
in 
such a centre: His name has become a double symbolic borderline 
of a kind, dividing the centre-left space from communists, on 
the one hand, and from liberals, on the other. 
  "This structure would become not only a discussion club for 
Russian social democrats. It would enable us, at long last, to 
participate in the international movement on a regular basis, 
including the socialist international, contacts with which 
convince Russian politicians that, until Russia has only 
disunited parties and groups, nobody will speak with them 
seriously." 
  NEZAVISIMAYA also claims that "head of the president's 
office 
Sergey Filatov who remained at his post only thanks to a 
ballyhoo raised concerning his possible resignation, decided to 
prove his worthiness to Boris Yeltsin in the recent past. 
  "According to Filatov's plan, it is necessary to have a 
subdivision (some 120 staffers) in the president's office, which 
will launch even now a campaign for a new Russian president 
--Boris Yeltsin." 
  According to information available to the newspaper, many 
former legislators of "democratic" orientation received 
proposals to join this subdivision. Some of them refused, not 
in a very proper form at that. 
  Referring to a statement by deputy chairman of the state 
statistics committee Aris Zakharov, the ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA 
newspaper writes that "industrial production in Russia dropped 
by 26 per cent over the past five months. 
  "While the fall amounted to 12 per cent in the fuel and 
energy complex, its figure stood at 22 per cent in the food 
industry, 45 in machine-building and 35 per cent in the chemical 
and petrochemical industries. 
  "Every fourth major or medium industrial enterprise in 
Russia 
stood idle for more than one shift in may. Whereas a shortage 
of material resources was the main reason for the drop last 
year, difficulties with marketing and the problem of 
non-payments were to blame this year." 
  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA also reports that "former Russian 
Prosecutor- General Alexey Kazannik and his supporters from the 
Urals-Siberian region are establishing a party of people's 
conscience. Its first congress will be held in Yekaterinburg on 
Friday. 
  "Preparatory documents say that the party intends to direct 
its efforts at conducting a scientifically substantiated policy 
of reforms and forming competent governing structures, including 
the government. The party intends to announce right away their 
`constructive opposition' to the present authorities of the 
country." 
  The same newspaper runs an interview with Komi Republic 
President Yuriy Spiridonov who regards struggle against 
bureaucratic omnipotence as his main goal. "Small and big 
bureaucrats are our main enemies as well as the enemy of all 
Russia," he said. 
  "The most spectacular projects and initiatives are scrapped 
at the level of a bureaucrat. Mr. or Mrs. Smiths often have 
powers incomparable with the power of minister or president." 
  The ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI newspaper informs its readers that 
7,948 people fell ill with diphtheria between last January and 
April, or 3.5 times more than over the corresponding period last 
year. The incidence of the infectious disease in Moscow is two 
or four times higher than the country's average. 
  The same newspaper reports that the last terrorist out of 
four who captured hostages at a prison in Yekaterinburg 
surrendered to law enforcement officers. All hostages were 
freed. One terrorist was killed during the operation, and 
another escaped. 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI reports that law enforcement bodies 
exposed 
eight serious crimes over the past 24 hours. According to the 
public relations centre of the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service (FCS), the Moscow FCS department completed a multi-stage 
operation to bust a gun-running mob which supplied the Moscow 
region with firearms. 
  The same newspaper expresses an opinion by chairman of the 
Russian Social Democratic Party Anatoliy Golov about former 
Vice- President Aleksandr Rutskoy's party. "I'd like to remind 
our new colleagues that social democrats are reformers in their 
essence rather than revolutionaries," he notes. 
  "Regrettably, `popular' social democrats are closer, in 
spirit, to Pamyat (eds: nationalist organisation). I'm afraid 
that they will want to call themselves a national social 
democratic party with time." 
  Despite a refutation from Presidential Press Secretary 
Vyacheslav Kostikov, the KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper, 
referring to reliable sources in the Russian Government, 
continues to assert that "quarters close to President Boris 
Yeltsin decided, in principle, the question of Premier Viktor 
Chernomyrdin's resignation for health reasons and the 
appointment of Yuriy Skokov to this post". 
  The PRAVDA newspaper features an interview with Dmitriy 
Olshanskiy, director of the Strategic Analysis and Forecast 
Centre and co-chairman of the Russian Patriotic Movement 
"People's Alliance", who says: "People got tired of politics and 
stopped treating it seriously. 
  "The time of rallies has passed. It is time to come to 
agreement inside the political elite. Zyuganov's communists 
understand this. Indeed, neither Yeltsin, nor Yerin nor still 
anybody else stand at the helm of the state but elite 
forces--analysts, financiers and politicians--they rule the 
roost." 
  Some 100 enterprises will be offered at voucher auctions in 
St. Petersburg till the end of June, including two huge shopping 
centres and munitions factories, reports the SANKT-PETERBURGSKIE 
VEDOMOSTI newspaper.

  [Text] Moscow June 9 TASS -- Process of peaceful settlement 
in the former Yugoslavia is nowadays in need of urgent 
activization, Grigoriy Karasin, spokesman for the Russian 
Foreign Ministry, told a Moscow briefing on Thursday. 
  Though "the Contact Group", which communicates with the 
belligerents directly, has made an important preparatory 
contribution, it is still unable to supplant a meeting of 
foreign ministers, he said. 
  "Moscow considers it necessary to accelerate preparations 
for 
holding a new meeting of foreign ministers. We believe the 
meeting could take place within a week or two," the spokesman 
said. 
  Moscow hails the fact that the warring parties in Bosnia 
have 
agreed through the mediation of the United Nations to suspend 
offensive operations and other provocative acts for a month, he 
said. The agreement comes into force tomorrow at noon (local 
time). 
  "The most important thing at present is the fact that the 
parties involved in the military conflict in former Yugoslavia 
are actually prepared to carry out the reached agreement. The 
vitality of the truce depends on their position, self-restraint 
and political will," Karasin added. 
  Aleksandr Belyayev, a Russian soldier of the UN Protection 
Force, who was fatally wounded in the beginning of this months, 
died on June 7. A close investigation into the tragic accident 
is now under way, Karasin told the briefing.

  [Text] Russia wants the next "ministerial" meeting on 
settlement in Bosnia and Herzegovina to be held in a week or 
two, a high-ranking Russian diplomat said in an interview with 
INTERFAX on Thursday. 
  He said that the exact time-frame for this meeting could be 
defined before the end of the week. The foreign ministers and 
secretaries of Russia, the U.S.A., Great Britain, France and the 
EU troika (Germany, Greece and Belgium) will discuss these 
issues in Istanbul where they will take part in the meeting of 
the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC). 
  Russia seeks to invite representatives of the parties to the 
conflict in Bosnia to the "ministerial" meeting, to tell them 
about the results of the work of the contact group on the map of 
the demarcation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. After this the 
parties must have two or three weeks to think everything over 
and to settle the disputed issues. Thereafter, a long-term 
agreement putting an end to hostilities must be signed, the same 
sources told INTERFAX.

  [Text] The visit of Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic to 
Moscow will be of non-official nature. He will come in order to 
receive the Sholokhov literature award, Russian Foreign Ministry 
Spokesman Grigoriy Karasin told Interfax on Thursday. 
  Karasin said that Karadzic had informed the Russian Foreign 
Ministry on his visit and had asked to arrange for him several 
meetings with Russian officials. "We will see how it will be. 
The issue has not been solved yet since we do not know the 
schedule of the officials who Karadzic wants to meet," Karasin 
emphasized. 
  Karasin did not rule out meetings at the official level.

  [Text] Moscow, May 9 (TANJUG) -- President of the Bosnian 
Serb Republic (R.S.) Radovan Karadzic's visit to Moscow has been 
postponed probably until early next week, as he has not received 
the necessary travel papers from the U.N. sanctions committee, 
TANJUG learned here on Thursday. 
  The U.N. Security Council imposed in late May 1992 the 
comprehensive and mandatory sanctions on the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) for its alleged involvement in 
the civil war in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Grigoriy Karasin, senior official of the Russian Foreign 
Ministry, said on Thursday that Karadzic's visit to Moscow would 
be private, but he did not rule out the possibility of the R.S. 
president's meeting with officials. He is coming to Moscow to 
receive the `Mikhail Sholokhov' award for literature, but the 
posssibility is not ruled out that he might meet with some 
officials. This will depend also on the schedule of the 
officials with whom Karadzic wants to hold talks, said Karasin. 
  In Moscow, Karadzic is to receive the award which was 
conferred on him by the Russian Writers' Association in 
acknowledgment of his literary work. The `Mikhail Sholokhov' 
award was instituted two years ago at the initiative of the 
Russian Writers' Association and the Russian writers' STMCK 
Company. 
  Karadzic is the first foreigner to receive the award which 
has so far gone to six Russian writers.

  [Text] Moscow, June 9 (TASS) -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin signed a decree "on the participation in peacekeeping 
operations for maintenance of peace in the zone of the 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict." 
  The decree, which came to ITAR-TASS from the presidential 
press service, says that this decision was adopted following the 
deterioration of the situation in the zone of the 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict and proceeding from the support 
given by CIS states to a proposal to carry out a peace-keeping 
operation in the zone of the conflict and taking into account 
repeated requests made by Georgian and Abkhazian leaders to 
deploy peace-keeping forces without delay. 
  Yeltsin decreed: "To take part in carrying out a 
peace-keeping operation by the Commonwealth of Independent 
States for the maintenance of peace in Abkhazia." (point 1) 
  The Russian Government has been instructed to ensure the 
formation of the necessary military contingent on the basis of 
Russian troops having a status of a peace-keeping force, with 
the use of the infrastructure of the Russian Armed Forces 
stationed in the Caucasus, with its possible subsequent 
reinforcement after the federation council adopts a 
corresponding decision. 
  The decree goes into effect since the moment of signing, 
except point 1, which will come into force after the federation 
council adopts a decision on the use of the Russian military 
contingent as part of the CIS peace-keeping force in Abkhazia. 
  The decree has been submitted to the federation council for 
consideration.

  [Text] Moscow, 9 Jun -- Yevgeniy Ambartsumov, a member of 
the Russian State Duma who chaired the foreign policy committee 
in the former Supreme Soviet, has made a strong appeal against 
the Russian parliament's ratification of a Russo-Georgian 
treaty. In his words, Armenia has already become Russia's 
strategic ally in the Caucases; therefore, there is no need to 
make any concessions to Georgia.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Vladimir Solntsev] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 10 TASS -- "Russia's idea to hold an 
international conference on the Korean peninsula's security and 
nuclear-free status are meeting with increasing understanding 
and support", Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov 
told ITAR- TASS. The diplomat met North Korean Ambassador to 
Russia Son Sung- pil on Wednesday [8 June], and Chinese 
Ambassador Wang Jinqing -- on Friday. 
  According to the deputy foreign minister, "nobody objects in 
principle" to an international conference, which should be 
attended, in Moscow's opinion, by representatives from North and 
South Korea, Russia, the United States, China, Japan, and also 
the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
  Panov noted that "the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
is now calling much more persistently for such a conference". A 
sufficiently positive assessment of the Russian initiative was 
made by the North Korean Ambassador and somewhat earlier, in 
Kiev, by North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam. "They said 
that they regard our idea with full understanding, because it 
pursues the purpose of achieving a peaceful settlement of the 
problem. They are prepared to study it carefully," Panov stated. 
  According to the deputy foreign minister, "some people 
believe that first it is necessary to impose sanctions on North 
Korea and then to hold such a conference. We believe that this 
is a strange approach. There will most probably be no 
conference if the sanctions are clamped down". 
  Panov recalled that the procedure proposed by Russia was 
determined by President Boris Yeltsin. He believes that "the 
conference should be held first in order to make full use of all 
the available political opportunities, including talks. After 
that North Korea could be warned about the sanctions and then 
subjected to them. However, we think that things will not go to 
such length." 
  "At present," the Russian diplomat said, "we regard the 
conference as the only alternative, because the bilateral talks 
between the United States and the Democratic People's Republic 
of Korea have landed in an impasse". He recalled that Moscow 
"did not object to the bilateral format, but since it has been 
exhausted, we must try to use the international version". "We 
proceed from the premise that it is necessary, first and 
foremost, to try this approach," the deputy foreign minister 
stressed.

<F P=106> [Igor Petrov article: "Russian Commercial Banks Ready for </F>
Competition. But Only Among Themselves"] 
  [Text] The disputes on the activity of foreign banks in 
Russia which were on the point of dying down seem to be about to 
flare up again with renewed force. It cannot be ruled out that 
is connected with the request of the French bank subsidiary 
"Societe Generale Rossiya" and the Moscow branch of the 
"Austria" bank for admission to the Association of Russian 
Banks, one of the most influential banking organizations. 
  Let me remind you that the "Austria" bank was licensed by 
the 
Central Bank of Russia to set up a branch in Moscow without the 
right to provide services to Russian residents back on 5 October 
1992. The "Societe Generale Rossiya," with an incorporation 
capital of $35 million, was given broader powers by the Central 
Bank of Russia, but because it did not begin working with 
residents before 15 November 1993 it fell under the effect of 
the President's "restrictive" edict and has now formally lost 
that right for two years. 
  Local Russian bankers look so self-assured and respectable 
in 
their TV advertisements but almost in unison plead poverty when 
it comes to competing in the banking services market with 
well-known Western financial institutions. So far they have 
successfully used the banner of judicious protectionism to 
justify raising a solid barrier against their foreign 
counterparts' penetration of Russia. For example, Sergey 
Filatov, director of the President's Staff, has officially 
confirmed that there is no draft presidential edict on expanding 
the operations of foreign banks on Russian territory in 
preparation. 
  At the same time, Vice Premier Aleksandr Shokhin has stated 
that if bilateral agreements are signed between Russia and the 
European Union [EU] or any other country on mutual preferences 
in the granting of access to each other's market, the government 
will ask the president to lift the prohibitive effect of his 
edict on those countries' banks. 
  In A. Shokhin's words, the Russian Government will work for 
the "gradual extension of the national regime to foreign banks." 
But there are quite a few exclusions of a protectionist nature 
in agreements with the EU right now. For example, foreign 
banks' capital must not exceed 12 percent of total Russian bank 
capital, there is a three-year restriction on their dealing in 
securities, and the minimum residue in their accounts must be at 
least 50,000 ECU's. 
  Russia's commercial banks have been given a considerable 
head 
start. But will they be able to use it to the benefit of their 
clients?

  [Text] Russia intends to secure from the Paris Club a 
deferment for the repayment of 20 billion dollars, a 
high-ranking representative of the Finance Ministry told the 
Financial Information Agency, commenting on the recent agreement 
on the deferment of the repayment of 7 billion dollars. 
  By agreement with the Paris Club, Moscow will repay the 7 
billion dollars over a period stretching till the year 2010. To 
quote this representative, the talks held in Paris on June 2 and 
3 were based on the March agreement between Moscow and the 
International Monetary Fund on the extension of the second part 
of the 1.5 billion dollar systematic transformation credit. 
  To reach an agreement on deferment, Russia is to secure the 
International Monetary Fund's approval and receive reserve 
credit from it of about 4 billion dollars. 
  Talks between the Central Bank and Finance Ministry on the 
one hand, and the International Monetary Fund on the other are 
to begin next autumn.

  [Text] Russia and Malaysia intend to continue their talks 
on military cooperation, Interfax was informed by Sergey 
Chumachenko, head of the Rosvooruzheniye state company's foreign 
economic relations department, told Interfax. The company 
signed a contract worth 600 million US dollars on June 7 for the 
supply of 18 MiG-29 fighter planes to Malaysia. 
  Chumachenko said that the two countries would, "after a 
short 
breather," continue talks on a broad range of issues, which 
could include upgrading Malaysia's navy. 
  He denied that Moscow had sold the fighters on the cheap. He 
said representatives from the Dementiyev Aviation and Industrial 
Association, which manufactures the aircraft, had been present 
at the talks and when the contract was signed and they would 
hardly have agreed to under-price their own products. 
  The contract with Malaysia also provides for the supply of 
facilities to service the aircraft before the end of the year, 
training for staff, and spare parts both during and after the 
guarantee period runs out. Approximately 75 pct of the total 
cost of the contract will be paid off in hard currency, and the 
remainder in supplies of palm-oil for sale by Moscow to other 
countries. 
  Rosvooruzhheniye, Russia's leading exporter and importer of 
arms and military hardware, was set up at the end of last year 
after a decree by Russian President Boris Yeltsin.

  [Text] The Indonesian Foreign Ministry's Public Affairs 
Director (Abid) said in an interview with ITAR-TASS on 9 June 
that, as the chair state of the nonaligned movement, Indonesia 
is making quiet diplomatic efforts to peacefully resolve the 
serious nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula. Indonesia is 
relying on the dispatch of special envoys to countries directly 
concerned of the dispute, including the DPRK, the United States, 
the PRC, and Japan, and the contact with the International 
Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. These are aimed at peacefully 
solving all the problems, he said. 
  The Foreign Ministry spokesman pointed out that the nuclear 
issue of the Korean peninsula had been discussed in depth during 
the meeting of the foreign ministers of nonaligned countries 
held in Cairo some time ago. The participants agreed that 
problems concerning the Korean peninsula should be solved 
through peaceful means and that contacts between all parties 
concerned should continue.

  [Text] Russian First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets commented 
on the details of the contract for selling 18 Russian MiG-29 
jets to Malaysia. He said that the contract costing 550 million 
dollars will ensure employment for 100,000 people on Russian 
industrial military enterprises over the next two years. There 
will also be more jobs at enterprises producing spare parts for 
military jets until the contract expires. 
  Soskovets emphasized that other ASEAN (Association of South 
East Asian Nations) countries had also showed interest in 
Russian military equipment. Soskovets stressed that the 
contract with Malaysia was even more important since in 1994 the 
Russian Air Forces had ordered only 17 military jets from the 
military industrial enterprises. 
  Speaking on the contacts with Russian diplomats in Kuala 
Lumpur and Delhi where the Russian governmental delegation had 
stopped on its way from Malaysia, Soskovets regretted that 
Russian diplomats hardly knew the realities of life in Russia or 
bilateral economic relations and just kept complaining about the 
conditions of living and working in the country where they were 
sent. Soskovets announced that he had asked Deputy Foreign 
Minister Igor Ivanov to make a report on the performance of the 
Russian embassies in India and Malaysia.

<F P=106> [Anatoliy Veslo report under the "Cadres" rubric: "Yeltsin </F>
Has Been Asked To Disclose Agents"] 
  [Text] Forty-eight Radio Liberty employees are waiting for 
President Yeltsin to answer a letter they sent from Munich. The 
letter was delivered through registered mail to the address: 
Sergey Filatov, c/o the President, Moscow, the Kremlin. 
Therefore, one would have thought, it is at the disposal of 
Boris Yeltsin's staff. 
  This missive is an open letter, that is to say it is 
intended 
for public consumption. Which is why we feel free to disclose 
its contents. Having reminded the president that in August 1991 
he lauded "Liberty," several of its employees complained that 
this radio station "has been in past years one of the targets of 
the KGB," which had infiltrated its agents there. They asked 
Boris Yeltsin to emulate Vaclav Havel who "has submitted 
information on the agents who worked at one time or who still 
continue to work for the Czechoslovak service," and "to 
declassify the list of KGB agents infiltrated (or recruited) in 
Radio Liberty. 
  One can appreciate the radio station's employees' anxiety -- 
that any of their colleagues may turn out to be a secret enemy. 
Among those who signed the letter, there are not many names 
known to listeners -- but then this too is understandable 
because an average employee is often in no position to see who 
is who, and some help from the president of Russia, who is known 
for his ability to work in the realm of personnel, could be 
useful to such an employee. 
  In the meantime, according to some information, the staff of 
the radio station financed by the U.S. Congress may be cut, 
especially in the process of the possible move of its 
headquarters from Munich to Prague. Most certainly, when 
personnel cuts are inevitable, employees not too certain of 
their future cannot but do their best to show their political 
loyalty while at the same time fingering those bosses who should 
be fired in their stead. 
  Incidentally, some sources report that being discussed in 
Moscow is the following version of a reply to the letter -- to 
propose to President Clinton to declassify the lists of CIA 
agents at Radio Liberty, first in order to compare them with the 
Russian list, and second in order that the radio station's 
chiefs could see who of their employees are regarded by special 
services as pros.

  [Text] Moscow, 9 Jun -- The rules of using Russia's air 
space have been violated 109 times in the past year. This was 
done 22 times by aircraft of the former USSR states, and 27 
times by planes belonging to other foreign states. The air 
defense troops have been forced to take decisive measures with 
regard to transgressors. Forty five aircraft were forced to land 
en route or to return to their place of departure. 
  These figures were cited in an appeal by the command of the 
air defense troops to all ministries and departments, as well as 
to the management of Russian commercial and foreign airlines. 
The document, which ITAR-TASS received today from the press 
service of the air defense forces main command, requests that 
the rules for the use of Russian Federation air space be 
strictly observed, and stresses that only concerted action can 
prevent emergency situations, including those involving human 
losses.

  [Text] Brasilia June 9 TASS -- The text of a speech made by 
Georgiy Mamedov, leader of the Russian delegation and deputy 
foreign minister, at the 24th session of the General Assembly of 
the Organisation of American States (OAS) in the Brazilian city 
of Belem, was circulated as an official document on Wednesday. 
  Russia, which was granted the status of permanent observer 
at 
the OAS in 1992, comes out in favour of "in-depth dialogue with 
American states sharing common democratic values and the 
striving for security and peace", the document emphasised. 
  The economic reforms experience gained in Latin American 
countries can be of much benefit to Russia. There are real 
prerequisites for broader trade, economic, scientific and 
technical cooperation between Russia and countries in the 
region. The establishment of contacts in the field of advanced 
technology, in space research and the uses of nuclear energy, in 
particular, can be of great importance, the document pointed out. 
  In his speech Mamedov also stressed the importance of 
cooperative action in combating drug trafficking. 
  The OAS, which brings together the United States, Canada, 
and 
32 Latin American countries, was founded in 1948 and is the most 
widely-representative and authoritative hemispheric organisation.

  [Text] Slovakia is the first of the "Visegrad group" of 
countries to agree to visa-free travel for its citizens and 
citizens of Russia in both directions. An intergovernmental 
agreement was signed here today which introduces liberal 
conditions for travel under a general civil passport. This 
applies to all people who travel to Russia or Slovakia with an 
invitation for private or official business and for tourism or 
medical treatment for a period of up to 30 days. Visas will 
only be needed by those people who intend to look for work or 
change their permanent place of residence. 
  "The agreement which has been signed," Foreign Minister 
Eduard Kukan stated in an interview with your ITAR-TASS 
correspondent, "will help to deepen mutual contacts and 
cooperation between the two countries' citizens. This is 
dictated by the mutual interests of Slovakia and Russia but is 
not evidence of a new emphasis in Slovakia's eastern policy."

  Karasin also said that at its emergency meeting the Tajik

Russians. Investigation teams in which military prosecutors are

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Knyazkov: "New Deadline -- Three Years </F>
Hence. Moldavia Agrees That Withdrawal of Russian 14th Army in 
1994 Is Unrealistic"] 
  [Text] The ninth round of the Russian-Moldavian talks on 
the status of and deadline for the withdrawal of the Russian 
14th Army from the territory of Moldavia [Moldova] took place in 
Moscow on 7-8 June. Unlike previous rounds, so special envoy 
Vladimir Kitayev, head of the Russian delegation, announced, the 
talks took a more constructive course. The Moldavian side 
abandoned its demand for the withdrawal of the 14th Army by 1 
July 1994 and suggested that it be done over a period of three 
years. Clearly, the more realistic approach to the deadline for 
the withdrawal of Russian forces is connected with the change in 
the political climate in Kishinev [Chisinau] following the 
Moldavian parliamentary elections. 
  The Moldavian delegation included four representatives of 
the 
Dniester region as observers. On 7 June a statement was issued 
in their name to the effect that Tiraspol is totally against the 
withdrawal of the 14th Army. But if it is decided nonetheless 
to withdraw it, the Dniester region intends to insist that all 
the Army's property and armaments remain in the Dniester 
Moldavian Republic. This statement further emphasizes that the 
"Dniester problem" is still as acute as ever, despite the fact 
that confidence has begun to grow of late in relations between 
Kishinev and Tiraspol. But it was pretty obvious at this round 
of the Russian-Moldavian talks too that the withdrawal of 
Russian subunits from the territory of Moldova can be 
implemented only if the safety of civilians on both sides of the 
Dniester is secured. 
  The information from the Russian Federation Ground Forces 
press center (I would point out that Colonel General Eduard 
Vorobyev, deputy commander in chief of the ground forces, heads 
the group of military representatives in the Russian delegation) 
is that progress has been made on a main agreement on the legal 
status, procedure, and deadline for the withdrawal of our forces 
from Moldavia. The delegations discussed agreements on Russian 
military aircraft's flying activities in the Republic of 
Moldavia, on the use of the airfield in Tiraspol by Russian 
Federation Defense Ministry transports, and a number of other 
topics. 
  Seven agreements between Russia and Moldavia have been 
concluded and implemented since 8 August 1992, when the first 
round of talks took place. 
  An agreement on equivalent exchange for the 189th Missile 
Brigade is in the implementation stage: Russia has bought 
transport and loading systems from Moldavia and is supplying 
noncombat military equipment and property in exchange.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Koretskiy report: "Draft Treaty on Baykonur </F>
Ready. Moscow Has Yet To Ponder Kazakh Draft"] 
  [Excerpts] The Russian-Kazakh wrangle over Baykonur is 
nearing denouement. Pointing to this is a draft treaty on 
leasing the space center worked out in Alma-Ata [Almaty] and 
passed on to the head of the Russian Space Agency [RSA]. It 
does not transcend the framework of the March understandings 
between the presidents of the two countries as regards its 
principle positions. Kazakhstan's confidence this document will 
be signed soon, however, is clearly premature. [passage 
omitted] 
  The draft leasing agreement received by RSA head Yuriy 
Koptev 
from his Kazakh counterpart Aysultan Kalybayev contains, in 
addition to general, "non-negotiable" -- as Mr. Kalybayev put it 
-- terms of the lease -- the sum and the duration (20 years with 
a possible extension for another 10 years) -- also contains 
terms that the men in Moscow decline to comment on for the time 
being. For example, Alma-Ata intends to charge extra for water 
and electricity supply to the space center and for temporary 
right-of-way status for territories in the path of falling 
separating parts of booster rockets. True, Mr. Kalybayev 
promises, the cost of these services "will not exceed the level 
envisioned for internal consumers." Neither has the question of 
including in the cost of leasing the additional "space-related" 
services (doing research on commission, flights by Kazakh 
cosmonauts and many other things) been decided. These costs, 
experts believe, may amount to 50 percent of the proposed 
leasing sum. 
  In this connection, the hopes nurtured in Alma-Ata for the 
signing of the treaty as early as end of June are so far 
premature. More so because, as your KOMMERSANT-DAILY 
correspondent has managed to learn, at the moment the RSA is not 
even talking about looking at the Kazakh version. Considering 
the fact that Russia, as they have advised at the RSA, "has its 
own ideas" about the leasing pattern, as well as a mechanism for 
making such decisions, one can say in full confidence that the 
signing cannot take place before two or three months from now. 
If no new snags develop.

<F P=106> ["Theses" of speech by Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich </F>
delivered at the inauguration of the Center of Ethnic Cultures 
on 3 June 1994: "There Will Never Be Second-Rate People in 
Belarus"] 
  [Text] Dear compatriots! 
  I want to use today this simple and, at the same time, 
meaningful phrase that unites us all -- citizens of the Republic 
of Belarus! 
  All of us in our young sovereign state should aim for a 
single goal and desire -- to realize ourselves and become 
forever a single nation of Belarus. 
  While looking in the statistical data, one may easily see 
that Belarus is a multinational state. Almost one-third of its 
population is comprised of Russians, Ukrainians, Jews, 
Lithuanians, Poles, Tatars, and other nationalities. 
  Our policy is based on respect with regard to all 
nationalities living in the territory of the Republic. Creating 
the model for our new statehood, we have laid fundamental 
principles of the relations between the state and all 
nationalities. These are: civic equality, social equality, 
economic, and political guarantees for every resident of the 
Republic, regardless of nationality, rights to national cultural 
development, and many others. 
  Now, inaugurating our cultural center, I have remembered an 
idea from ancient philosophers: "A nation is strong because of 
its people!" 
  It is a great happiness when the social and historical 
foundations of one nation is interwoven with the cultures and 
traditions of many ethnic communities. This enriches the 
intellectual life of the entire society. 
  As a matter of fact, we cannot put artificial national 
barriers between us today. 
  In our Republic, over half of the marriages are mixed; past, 
present, and future generations are closely joined by blood and 
cultural affinity. 
  However, every one of us has an undeniable right (and a holy 
right, as well) to preserve his or her national heritage, 
historical culture, and spiritual values. 
  The guarantor of all this is the state -- sovereign and 
multinational in its essence. 
  These guarantees are set forth in our Constitution and laws. 
  They include the right to education in native language, the 
right to follow one's national cultural tradition, and the right 
to national and political equality. 
  All this is important, not only in a physical aspect. We are 
faced today with the difficult task to find a way out of the 
economic crises. This task can be resolved only by our joint 
efforts. Only a nation that holds together the best sources of 
various national cultures, common intellectual life, and civic 
accord, is capable of resolving such a problem. 
  I, being one of the state leaders, can see all these 
problems 
very clearly. Therefore, the government continues to render 
assistance to all ethnic cultural associations. 
  Yes, I am a supporter of dual citizenship. Not everything is 
simple in this issue. However, I think that one will feel 
oneself more stable socially if the issue is resolved this way. 
This is a very democratic and civilized norm. Yet there are 
opponents. You know who they are. 
  One more argument. Over 3 million Belarusians are living 
outside of our Fatherland. They are true sons and daughters of 
Belarus. They have the right to possess the citizenship of their 
Republic. 
  I also rule out a possibility of the partition of our 
society 
due on the principle of the indigenous nation and national 
minorities. 
  Dear fellow-citizens! 
  We undoubtfully need a network of such centers, as this one 
being inaugurated today, in other regions of the Republic. We 
must render governmental assistance to multinational system of 
publishing. It is necessary to broadcast special programs for 
the nationalities on radio and television. 
  It is necessary to create kindergartens, classes, and 
schools 
namely for the nationalities. This is not an infringement on 
Belarusian language, education, and culture. 
  This is a logical and natural process in the life of a 
civilized and multinational state. 
  These days, one may often hear that there is nothing wrong 
in 
the word "nationalism." Is it a good word? The point is not in 
the ideas themselves, but in that what is behind these ideas 
historically. We know very well, and remember, that this means 
woe, tears, interethnical conflicts, human blood... 
  I did not even mention fascism. 
  There is, and will ever be, no roots of nationalism in 
Belarus. Here live different peoples -- of great spirit and 
philanthropy. 
  This is a country where nobody will be able to impose on the 
people the shameful norm of taking on employees according to the 
percentage of nationalities; there will also never be 
second-rate people in Belarus. Our people are capable of 
cutting off any shoots of nationalism and put them into 
historical rubbish! 
  National cultural problems also include those of religions. 
We have over 20 religions today. Understandably, there are 
numerous religions, as well as small ones. 
  The matter is in something else. The issues of national 
accord go well back to the high principles of divine morals. It 
is not important what your religious beliefs may be. It is 
important how you honor those principles. I would not like 
discuss politics today. The best politics -- I am sure that you 
will agree with me -- is to accomplish a concrete business. 
  For example, the creation of our cultural center is a good 
foundation for future business. 
  The center will be visited by both adults and children. It 
will be a source of what can be called by one good word -- the 
Motherland. 
  We have a custom of giving presents on such momentous days. 
As a matter of fact, this center is a present from the 
government and our good-willed veterans who amiably agreed to 
make room for the cultural center in their place. 
  However, I am of different stock. I prefer to feel myself a 
debtor, in the good sense of the word, with regard to the 
development of ethnic cultures and interethnic relations -- it 
opens a permanent perspective for resolving new tasks and 
problems in this direction. 
  Thank you for your attention and I wish you every happiness 
in your new home!

  [Text] Prospects for development, privatization, price 
formation, and other issues were discussed at a Republican 
seminar- conference on trade issues. Head of the Belarusian 
Government Vyachaslaw Kebich delivered a report. Speaking about 
prices for goods, the prime minister stated that the government 
failed to stabilize them thus far. The key reason is an 
exterior factor, however, the minor reason is that trade also 
had its own expenditures. Many middlemen -- boosting prices -- 
have emerged. Their numbers can and should be minimized. 
According to the prime minister, the government should bridle 
price formation through the Department for Prices. 
  The head of the government also met yesterday with the 
working collective of the Kirov factory.

  [Text] Beginning today, the Cabinet of Ministers' 
resolution has decreased prices for certain foodstuffs by 15 
percent. By issuing this resolution, the Cabinet of Ministers 
took control over mark ups and reduced all of them to (?10) 
percent which enables customers to save a small sum of money. 
  For example, the price for sausages, which stood earlier at 
28.700 rubles [R], decreased by R4.500. Beef became cheaper by 
R3,000 and pork -- by R3.500. Beginning today, prices for bread 
and flour products, meat offals, and butter --which were sold at 
market prices -- have also been changed.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F>
Nikolai Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovsky; edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] Former chairman of the Belarusian parliament 
Stanislav Shushkevich promised that if he were elected 
president, the country would overcome the crisis in early 1995 
and an economic recovery would start in 1996. 
  His electoral platform says that he would initiate reforms, 
which should cut the monthly inflation rate to 7 to 10 percent 
against the present over 40 percent. 
  Under a plan his team have developed, within six months the 
average citizen would earn $100 to $150 a month against the 
present $3. 
  Shushkevich and his supporters want to create as soon as 
possible a private sector and to improve the management of the 
state sector. The platform says that the private sector would 
put the economy on its feet, create competition, lead to a 
restructuring and modernization, make the economy work for the 
people and create jobs. 
  Shushkevich promised he would use to the maximal advantage 
of 
the Republic's geographical position of a bridge between Russia 
and Western Europe, Ukraine, and the Baltic countries. He 
thinks that it is necessary to carry out a national program of 
encouraging the export that would facilitate transformation of 
the traditional markets in CIS member nation into those where 
international competition is welcome. 
  Once he became president, Shushkevich would reduce the 
import 
of fuels and grain and use customs tariffs to encourage the 
import of technologies and equipment. 
  The platform offers free choice between the kinds of land 
ownership such as collective farms, state farms, individual 
farms, cooperatives and farm product processing society. It 
says that mechanisms had to be developed under which state-owned 
land would be rented and efficiently operating collectives or 
citizens could take it over from bankrupts. Only a land tax 
would be levied, eventually. The platform calls for 
demonopolization and privatization of the agrarian service and 
the processing industry with the participation of agricultural 
producers in the process. 
  Shushkevich also intends to change radically the budgetary 
and taxation policy. He is convinced that heavy taxes are the 
outcome of government overspending. He would have the state 
expenses cut by one third but would maintain if not increase the 
expenses for education, science, culture, public health, and 
elimination of the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. 
  Shushkevich would also increase the real estate tax, transit 
tariffs and duties on import of luxury goods and resolve the 
payment crisis by introduction of promissory notes which would 
become securities. 
  The reforms would enable the private owner to become the 
engine of the economic growth and stability. Thousands of 
small- and medium-size companies engaged in production of 
foodstuffs and consumer goods would spring to existence within a 
year, the platform argues. It expects the economic freedom to 
trigger an investment and construction boom in the manufacturing 
industries. New roads and communication lines as well as 
cottages would be built. As a result, the building material 
industry would flourish. The investment policy and the 
possibility to use the privatization money locally would step up 
business activities in every part of Belarus. The tax and 
subsidy reduction would enable redistribution of the cash in 
favor of the consumers with a significant increase of grants, 
pensions and wages concurrently with production increase. 
  Shushkevich promised he would immediately stop inflation and 
set up a working financing system using a convertible currency. 
If Russia did not agree to an equitable merger of the monetary 
system, Belarus would introduce its own currency. A strong 
currency would put a stop on the price rises, provide stability 
and confidence in the future.

  [Text] The Savings Bank of Belarus issued a report for 
Supreme Soviet consideration concerning [word indistinct] the 
indexation of individual deposits. This document is a reply to 
Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich's statement regarding the 
necessity to issue 100 percent compensations for people's 
depository losses prompted by inflation. 
  According to experts' estimates, over 1 trillion rubles is 
required to cover the losses -- caused by the devaluation of 
individual deposits -- by 100 percent. It goes without saying 
that it is necessary to repay the population what it lost not 
through its own will, believes Alyaksandr Barkun, deputy 
chairman of the Savings Bank of Belarus. However, two issues -- 
by exactly what sum the deposits will be increased and who will 
pay -- remain unresolved.

first five months of this year. The Border Troops Main 
Directorate informed KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's correspondent that during 
this period 948 violators had been detained, contraband goods

225 tonnes of nonferrous metals had been prevented, and 276 
weapons and 81 kg of drugs had been seized. The border guards 
have returned $750,000 to the state treasury. This sum,

allocated to the border guard department from the state budget 
for the current year. So the republic's "green caps" are 
earning their keep.

  [Text] Kishinev, 9 Jun -- The Dniester Republic leaders 
have accused the Moldovan leadership of dragging out the talks 
on a settlement to the Dniester region issue, said a statement 
issued today in Tiraspol by the Dniester Republic president's 
and government's press service. The document claims that "the 
attempts made by Tiraspol to speed up the negotiation process, 
which was started with Russia's mediation, has again run into a 
silent blockade by Moldova, and President Mircea Snegur has in 
fact withdrawn from further talks." 
  In this regard Igor Smirnov, head of the Dniester Republic, 
has appealed to Ambassador Vladlen Vasev, plenipotentiary envoy 
of the Russian president, to exert all his influence on Mircea 
Snegur. The statement also underlines that the inhabitants of 
the left bank of the Dniester river have postively assessed the 
joint statement by the leaders of Moldova and the Dniester 
Republic on finding a settlement to the aftermath of the armed 
conflict, which was signed at the end of April. 
  At a time when President Igor Smirnov is complaining about 
the lack of progress at the talks, State Secretary Valeriy 
Litskiy, chief coordinator at the talks from the Tiraspol side, 
discussed today with the CSCE mission in Moldova prospects of 
resuming the dialogue. They agreed that the talks could be 
continued in the near future following the return to Kishinev of 
Richard Samuel, head of the CSCE mission. The arrival of 
Vladlen Vasev, the special Russian envoy, is also expected then.

  [Text] Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev believes that 
the Republic has no other alternative but to pursue the policy 
of market reforms and democratizing of society. 
  Speaking in the Kazakh parliament on Thursday [9 June], he 
emphasized that the country had to face a very heavy economic 
and social crisis. Nazarbayev suggested that reforms in the 
credit-bank sphere were the guidelines of the economic policy. 
He said that the key task was to fight down the run-away 
inflation and to strengthen the national currency unit. 
  Nazarbayev underlined that to carry out the policy on 
investments it was necessary that the inflation rate did not 
exceed 10 pct per month. He said that the inflation rate might 
decrease in autumn to 9 pct or 10 pct if a tough credit policy 
be carried out. 
  In March, the inflation rate in Kazakhstan was 17 pct. In 
April, it went up to 31 pct. 
  Nazarbayev insisted that all state expenditures be reduced 
except for the vitally important ones and that there be no more 
direct or hidden subsidies to enterprises. 
  He also considered it necessary to free prices for all goods 
and services, and for bread. 
  "The budget must be tough in what concerns its 
implementation," the Kazakh president pointed out. 
  Nazarbayev was against resignation of the Kazakh Government 
led by Sergei Tereshchenko. "All of us can be changed. However, 
there is no way to fool the natural laws. We will just defer 
the agony and waste the time," he suggested. 
  Nazarbayev announced that the government had worked out a 
new 
program of anti-crisis measures. The president is expected to 
confirm it in the near future. Over 15 months the government 
may have a carte blanche for implementation of its program. 
  Nazarbayev proposed that a coalition of supporters of the 
reforms be established, in which all powers and public and 
political organizations would participate. He stressed that an 
atmosphere of stability and national accord was required for 
realization of the planned reforms. 
  Nazarbayev demanded that the government work out a special 
program in order to put an end to migration from Kazakhstan for 
ethnic reasons. He suggested that a new law on languages must 
be adopted and the status of the Russian language be reviewed. 
The Russian language in Kazakhstan is that of inter-ethnic 
communication but not the second state one. The policy on 
personnel issues must also be improved. 
  The Kazakh president said that the issue on citizenship was 
still pressing. He believes that all handicaps for acquisition 
of citizenship when moving from one country into another should 
be eliminated. 
  However, Nazarbayev stressed once again that Kazakhstan 
would 
not accept dual citizenship since its introduction could 
deteriorate the situation with inter-ethnic relations in the 
country. 
  Commenting on his initiative on establishment of the 
Euro-Asian Union, Nazarbayev emphasized that the CIS must be 
transformed into a more efficient formation -- "from the old 
irresponsible forms of integration to a totally new union." He 
suggested that the CIS peoples sought this but were hindered by 
the political elite. 
  Nazarbayev thought that the Euro-Asian Union could help to 
overcome the economic crisis and would be a guarantor for 
security of its member-states in the background of instability 
in the southern CIS. 
  Nazarbayev said that putting an end to military actions 
between the member-states of the future union would be one of 
the obligatory condition for those countries, which would like 
to join the Euro-Asian Union.

  [Text] Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev believes that 
the republic's capital should be transferred from Alma-Ata 
[Almaty] to Akmola before the end of the decade. On Thursday he 
called on the Kazakh parliament to adopt such a decision. In 
Nazarbayev's opinion, the capital should not be situated near 
the border but rather in the center of the state. He also 
justified his proposal by the fact that Akmola is located at a 
point where the major ethnic groups meet (in Kazakhstan Russians 
live predominantly in the north and Kazakhs -- in the south). 
In addition, Alma-Ata is situated in a seismic zone and is 
suffering from severe environmental problems.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 110 (600): </F>
Compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by 
Vladimir Shishlin] 
  [Text] Sergey Tereshchenko's government will receive "a 
carte blanche" from the head of the state for the near 15 months 
to implement a tough program of anti-crisis measures, President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev declared to the parliament Friday and 
stressed that he does not support the demand of the deputies 
corps on the Cabinet's resignation. 
  IF Note: Late May the Kazakh parliament voiced a statement 
on non-confidence in the social-economic and legal policy of the 
government. The document said that while declaring the course 
for the market economy, the Cabinet actually blocks it and this 
has resulted in an economic chaos in Kazakhstan. The Supreme 
Soviet also believes that until now the government failed to 
work out a national program for consolidation of the society. 
Commenting the demarche of the Supreme Soviet in his interview 
with INTERFAX, head of the Cabinet called the parliament's 
statement "unconstitutional." He emphasized that in accordance 
with the Constitution, the government is responsible only in the 
face of the president. 
  Nazarbayev reported to deputies that in the near term he 
intends to confirm a renewed program of anti-crisis measures 
prepared by the government. 
  He said that the country confronts the hardest economic and 
social crisis. In his opinion, reformation of the credit and 
bank system is the major direction which will ensure an optimal 
development of the economy, "stoppage of the running inflation 
and strengthening of the national currency" is the key task of 
the present moment. 
  Nazarbayev underlined that inflation should not exceed 10 
pct 
a month in order the state could implement its investment 
policy. He deems it possible to lower inflation rate this 
autumn to 9-10 percent under a tough credit policy. 
  According to available information, inflation rate in 
Kazakhstan this March was 17 percent and in April it raised to 
31 percent. 
  Nazarbayev insists to reduce all expenditures of the state 
"excluding the vitally important ones," to stop direct and 
indirect donations to the enterprises. He believes that it is 
necessary to recognize bankrupts the republic's unprofitable 
enterprises and to speed up privatization process. 
  In his opinion, it is also necessary to release prices for 
all kinds of goods and services and for bread. 
  "The budget should be tough in implementation," Nazarbayev 
underlined. 
  Nazarbayev commissioned the government to prepare a special 
program to stop migration from Kazakhstan due to national 
reasons. As he said, it is necessary to adopt a new decree on 
languages and to revise the status of the Russian language (in 
Kazakhstan it is the language for inter-ethnic association but 
not the second state language), and to remove drawbacks in the 
staff policy. 
  As Nazarbayev said, the issue on citizenship is as pressing 
as before. He thinks that it is necessary to remove all 
restrictions for citizenship in case of a transfer from one 
country to another one. 
  At the same time he reiterated that the dual citizenship is 
unacceptable for Kazakhstan because its introduction can make 
inter-ethnic relations in Kazakhstan more difficult. 
  Speaking about his idea to create the Euro-Asian Union, 
Nazarbayev pointed out that he deems it necessary to transform 
the CIS into a more efficient association -- "from an old form 
of integration to a qualitatively new union." He indicated that 
all peoples of CIS countries strive for this but the political 
elite prevents integration. 
  Nazarbayev believes that the Euro-Asian Union will assist in 
surmounting the economic crisis and will become the guarantor of 
outer security for the members of the union against the 
background of instability on CIS southern boundaries. 
  Nazarbayev specially emphasized that cessation of 
hostilities 
between members of the union and creation of common peacekeeping 
forces are among obligatory conditions providing for entering 
the Euro-Asian union. 
  Nazarbayev proposed to create a coalition of reforms 
supporters which will unite all branches of power and 
public-political movements. Nazarbayev emphasized that it is 
necessary to create an atmosphere of stability and national and 
civil accord in order to implement the scheduled reforms.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Mainayev] </F>
  [Text] Bishkek 9 June TASS -- Indian Minister of State for 
External Affairs Salman Khurshid expressed satisfaction with the 
results of his working visit to Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan]. 
  The minister said that all agreements, which are to be 
signed 
during Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's forthcoming 
official visit to Kirghizia, are almost ready or in the final 
stage of completion. The Indian premier is scheduled to visit 
the Republic in the first half of July. The agreements will 
cover a wide range of bilateral relations between the two 
countries, from trade, economic, cultural ties to working out 
fast coordinated actions in fight against international 
terrorism and drug trafficking. 
  A group of Indian businessmen, who are accompanying the 
minister, finalized their priorities in cooperation with their 
Kirghiz counterparts. The Indians are interested in the 
possibility of setting up joint enterprises to produce medicine, 
process agricultural produce, dress leather, manufacture paper, 
extract minerals and create infra-structure and 
telecommunications networks. 
  Salman Khurshid said that the two sides have almost agreed 
to 
allot a supply quota of mercury, antimony, rare-earth metals and 
dressed leather and pelts to India. According to the minister, 
India intends to review the agreement's clauses about making 
investments in Kirghizia and crediting specific branches of its 
economy. This is being done to find a compromise and satisfy 
both parties, he said.

  [Text] Dushanbe 10 June TASS -- The leadership of 
Tajikistan informed military authorities of the Afghan province 
of Kunduz bordering on Tajikistan the Republic's profound 
concern of the attempts of extremists from among the Tajik armed 
opposition located there to prevent by force the repatriation of 
Tajik refugees from Afghanistan. 
  The refugees willing to return home are subjected to threats 
and acts of terror are also threatened against representatives 
of international peacekeeping organisations in the Afghan port 
of Shirkhan on the border with Tajikistan. 
  On Wednesday, 8 June, the compound of the mission from the 
U.N. supreme commission for refugees and a car were damaged by 
the explosion of a mine planted by the militants. Also on 
Wednesday, Russian border guards found and defused and explosive 
device on board a barge which was bringing 242 Tajik refugees 
home from the Afghan port, ITAR-TASS was told by Chairman of the 
Tajik Parliament's working group for the repatriation of 
refugees from Kunduz Takhir Akhmedov. 
  Akhmedov stressed that during a meeting with the deputy 
security chief of the province, Mr. Majidkhan, Tajik officials 
made it clear that they want the local Afghan authorities to 
detain and punish those guilty of the acts of terror, and ensure 
security of more than 200,000 Tajik refugees who are now in 
transit camps near Shirkhan and of employees of international 
missions. 
  Akhmedov said an official representative of the Kunduz 
military authorities assured the Tajik authorities that relevant 
measures would be taken to suppress acts of provocation. 
  As concerns the process of repatriation of Tajik refugees 
from Afghanistan, Takhir Akhmedov said that despite attempts by 
Tajik armed opposition in Afghanistan at preventing the return 
by force, the process is becoming irreversible. One thousand 
and fifty hundred refugees returned from Afghanistan to 
Tajikistan in the past two days alone. The total number of 
people who have returned home has exceeded 30,000.

"Turkmenia Revises Tactics Toward Foreign Investors. Now They 
Cannot Participate in Developing Old Oil and Gas Deposits"] 
  [Text] Mamed Beknazarov, Turkmenian [Turkmenistan] deputy 
oil and gas minister, has announced Ashkhabad's [Ashgabat] 
intention to revise the tactic of inviting foreign investors to 
exploit the country's oil and gas deposits, POSTFACTUM reports. 
According to Beknazarov, in the next few years foreign firms 
will be able to participate only in developing new, not 
exploiting old, oil and gas deposits, as has been the case up to 
now. 
  This August, he said, a tender will be organized in 
Ashkhabad 
for the right to set up a joint venture to prospect and develop 
oil deposits on the right-hand bank of the Amu-Darya and in the 
northern part of the Caspian. In the fall, a tender will be 
announced for the license to prospect and develop oil deposits 
on the shelf of the South Caspian basin. Beknazarov reported 
that more than 20 different companies have shown an interest in 
these projects, including Japanese, U.S., and British ones 
(Chevron, Arco, Exxon, and Enterprise Oil). 
  The Turkmenian side intends to offer tender participants 
"model contracts," i.e., agreements with unchangeable terms. In 
all likelihood, they will be concluded for 31 years and envision 
the payment of a bonus in the amount of $5 million for 
prospecting an area of 4,000 sq km, profit sharing between the 
joint venture and the state in the proportion of 65 percent and 
35 percent respectively, and the payment of a profit tax of 25 
percent and an export tax of 10 percent. 
  Furthermore, if over six years the company does not begin 
development of an area, then under the contract it will be 
returned to the state without any compensation. 
  According to Beknazarov, as the requisite geological 
materials are prepared, seven blocks will be presented for 
international tenders with overall resources of 12.64 trillion 
cubic meters of gas and 5.735 trillion tonnes of oil.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature, compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovskiy and edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] President Levon Ter-Petrosyan favours plans to set 
up Russian military bases in Armenia. This has been told to 
journalists by Russia's Defence Minister Pavel Grachev at the 
end of his private talks with Armenian leaders on Wednesday [8 
June]. 
  In Grachev's words, it will finally decided on Thursday how 
many military bases will be set up, and what personnel they 
would employ. 
  As INTERFAX has learned from a negotiator, Russia is looking 
forward to creating two military bases in Armenia: one for a 
motorized infantry regiment at Erevan, the other for a motorized 
infantry division positioned at Gyumri. 
  In Grachev's view, an appropriate agreement with Armenia 
will 
be signed by 1 September. "By then, Army officers must decide 
for themselves who will stay in Armenia and who will return to 
Russia," Grachev said. 
  Military experts believe that the issue on funding was 
crucial to the talks between Ter-Petrosyan and Grachev. 
According to a spokesman for Grachev, the Armenian leadership 
wish that Russia would pay for leasing the sites for its Army in 
Armenia. However, the Russian side insists on the free use of 
Armenian lands in military purposes. 
  Negotiations on that continued on Thursday. 
  During his tour of Caucasian republics, Grachev also plans 
to 
meet with Georgia's leader Eduard Shevardnadze to discuss with 
him the possibility of Russian military presence in that 
republic (presumably at Tbilisi, Akhalkalaki, and Batumi -- IF). 
Besides, Grachev intends to discuss peace-keeping activity in 
the zone of Georgian-Abkhazi hostilities. 
  As he reported to journalists, at a meeting with President 
Geydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan slated for June 11, he would raise 
the issue on the need for that republic to adhere to the 
agreement on a Karabakh settlement, signed in Moscow on 17 May. 
Otherwise, he said, Russia would halt all mediation in 
resolving this conflict. 
  "If the conflicting parties want to stop the war, the 
signing 
of the Moscow accord is the best chance for that," Grachev 
stressed. 
  IF Note: On 17 May, Russia's Defence Minister Pavel Grachev 
mediated the signing by the leaders of Armenia and Karabakh of 
an agreement on a stage-by-stage settlement in Karabakh. Only 
the Azerbaijani side refused to sign the accord. Stage one 
provides for a ceasefire to be followed by a disengagement of 
hostile troops by 10-15 km, and by setting up mixed observation 
posts. During stage two and three, negotiators are to focus to 
ways of liberating the captured Azerbaijani territories and 
determining a status for Karabakhs. 
  Searches for a Karabakh settlement through Russian 
mnediation 
began in Kyrgyzstan's capital Bishkek in early May when 
lawmakers from Russia, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia, and Karabakh signed 
a protocol to cease-fire and disengage the troops. Azerbaijan 
refused to join the accord then. 
  Only one month later, on 8 June, at a session of the 
Interparliamentary Assembly in St. Petersburg, did the 
Azerbaijani Parliament's Speaker Rasul Guliyev put his signature 
under the Bishkek agreement. However, he argued that the 
document "does not solve all Karabakh problems." 
  In his opinion, since the protocol "only provides for a 
cease-fire, documents are required to work out a comprehensive 
settlement." He reported at the session that essential papers 
were being drafted with help from CSCE, CIS through Russian 
mediation." 
  "Azerbaijani is ready to negotiate these issues and 
determine 
a status for Karabakh but only after all Azerbaijan lands have 
been freed by political means," Guliyev remarked. 
  In his words, some Azerbaijani forces are trying to 
aggravate 
the conflict. They regard the Bishkek accords as a provocation 
from neighboring states. 
  Nonetheless, Guliyev advocated an early deployment of 
peace-keepers in Karabakh to operate under UN and CSCE control 
there. 
  The Armenian Parliament's Speaker Babken Ararktsyan claims 
that a shaky truce in Crabs [as received] can be breached any 
time, if the Bishkek protocol is not backed up by legal 
documents to be signed by heads of state. 
  He is convinced that without such signatures, the document 
"is incomplete in terms of the law." At the same time, he 
stressed that the Bishkek accord "has played its peace-keeping 
role."

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>
  [Text] Yerevan, 9 Jun -- The issue of the Russian base in 
Armenia has been settled in principle. It is planned to have 
one efficient military base installed in two localities on the 
Republic's territory. The main installation is to be in the 
Gyumri locality, where a Russian motorized infantry division is 
currently quartered, while part of the base's subunits will be 
stationed in Yerevan, where a Russian motorized infantry 
regiment is based at present. This opinion was shared by the 
members of the Russian military delegation at the summing-up 
conference held today by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. 
He noted that Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan was 
sympathetic toward the proposed Russian military base. 
  According to Grachev, the bases in Armenia should be set up 
by 1 August 1994. The minister noted that it will be quite a 
powerful body of troops and that there are plans to include 
antiaircraft and air force -- with the exception of 
long-distance aircraft -- elements alongside ground troops. "It 
will be a powerful air mobile force," Pavel Grachev said, "which 
can be deployed in any danger area at short notice should the 
need arise." 
  Apart from this, the question of creating a joint 
Russian-Armenian antiaircraft defense system within the 
framework of the collective security treaty was also discussed. 
The extent of the Russian and Armenian contributions in terms 
of materiel and personnel was established. In particular, 
Russia plans to station additional air defense subunits in 
Armenia to cover certain sections and control the Armenian 
airspace. These will be missile complexes and a squadron of 
interceptor planes. The final decision on the whole complex of 
questions concerning the Russian military base in Armenia will 
be made at the presidential level. 
  As one of the participants in the talks said to an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent, Russia intends to take legal posession of its 
military base for the period of 25 years. At the same time the 
Russian side hopes that "conditions do not mean that the base is 
being rented." Besides, the Russian side proposed that Moscow 
exercise direct control over the base. 
  According to Pavel Grachev, the Armenian side promised to 
assist in funding and provision for the Russian military base.

  [Text] Yerevan 10 June TASS -- Russian Defence Minister 
Pavel Grachev flies to Tbilisi this morning, where he will have 
a meeting with Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze. Later in 
the day, he plans to go to Gudauta, Abkhazia, where the Russian 
345th airborne regiment is stationed. 
  Turning to a dispatch of Russian peace keepers to Abkhazia, 
Grachev, now on a working tour of Transcaucasia, said in Yerevan 
that the military part of the problem on sending a Russian 
peace-keeping force to Abkhazia has been fully resolved. 
  The Russian Defence Ministry prepared for this purpose three 
motorised battalions out of two peace-keeping divisions deployed 
in the Leningrad and Volga Military Districts. They will be 
ready for air-lifting within three days, the minister said. 
  The 345th airborne regiment stationed in Gudauta is also 
ready for the peace-keeping mission. 
  Besides, the minister gave orders to the commander of the 
Russian Army group in Transcaucasia to prepare another three 
battalions for peace-keeping functions. 
  According to Grachev, the question of the dispatch of troops 
to Abkhazia can be resolved only at the political level. Troops 
are ready to fulfill the peace-keeping operation.

  [Text] Armenian Defense Minister Serzh Sargsyan maintained 
today that the republic's parliament would ratify the 
Russian-Armenian inter-governmental agreement on the status of 
Russian forces in the Republic this summer. "We must sign the 
treaty on the setting up of Russian bases on the Republic's 
territory by 1 September," he said in an exclusive interview 
with INTERFAX. 
  The inter-governmental agreement on the status of the 
Russian 
forces in Armenia was signed in 1992 and ratified by the former 
parliament of the Russian Federation in February 1993. 
  Sargsyan pointed out that the Republic's leadership is not 
insisting that Moscow pay rent for the land for these bases and 
for communal services. In his words, the Armenian leadership 
proposed that Russia's military department train Armenian 
citizens in Russian military colleges also "free of charge." 
  In addition, it was proposed to grant an opportunity to a 
contingent of Armenian servicemen to serve in the Russian 
military bases to be created in the Republic. 
  Commenting on the upcoming trip of Russian Defense Minister 
Pavel Grachev to Baku, Sargsyan said he thought it unlikely that 
Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev would join the agreement on 
the settlement of the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  Representatives of Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh, and Russia, 
which acted as mediator, signed a document on this issue on 17 
May in Moscow. 
  "After the statements of the Azerbaijani leaders stating 
that 
there will be not a single Russian soldier on the territory of 
the republic there can be hardly any progress on peaceful 
settlement of the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh," said Serzh 
Sargsyan. "They have burnt all their bridges by their 
statements," he added.

<F P=106> ["Transcript" of statements by Raul Malk, Estonian Foreign </F>
Ministry vice chancellor, and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister 
Vitaliy Churkin at Tallinn airport on 8 June -- received via 
Internet E-LIST] 
  [Text] The Russian Deputy Foreign Minister spent 24 hours 
in Estonia, meeting primarily with his counterpart from the 
Estonian Foreign Ministry, Raul Malk. Yesterday evening he had 
dinner with President Lennart Meri and this morning met with 
Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik. The following has been 
transcribed and translated by Juri Arusoo and Mari-Ann Rikken of 
the Press and Information Department of the Estonian Foreign 
Ministry. 
  Raul Malk (in Estonian): Over the course of two days we have 
had good talks. There is nothing concrete to announce at this 
stage. We have just agreed that we will continue as soon as 
possible. And now I hope you hear about the same. Meaning from 
Mr. Churkin. 
  Vitaliy Churkin (in Russian): This is my first press 
conference where I can't understand my colleague's language, but 
it is not a problem because I'll say about the same. First of 
all we are very satisfied with the atmosphere and character of 
the discussions which took place in Tallinn and which began a 
few days ago in Genevea. We are grateful to the Estonian side, 
and Mr. Malk. I had an opportunity as well to have a 
substantive discussion with the foreign minister and yesterday 
an informal, but long, interesting, and substantive meeting with 
President Meri. We are thankful to the Estonian side for 
providing such good conditions, for creating such an atmosphere 
of goodwill for these negotiations. It seems to me that we can 
say that we didn't talk only in a spirit of goodwill, but with a 
sincere attempt on both sides to solve as quickly as possible 
those questions which still remain, in order that we can turn 
the page, perhaps even finish an entire chapter in the history 
of our relations. To begin to write a new chapter starting with 
a new page, having solved completely those complicated problems 
which we have spent the last few months discussing. Now, 
however we have reached, as we hope, the final stage as concerns 
the understandings and agreements which were achieved by Russian 
Minister Kozyrev during his recent stay in Tallinn. 
  ITAR-TASS (in Russian): What were the concrete problems 
which 
were discussed? 
  Churkin (in Russian): The same which has been under 
discussion by the Estonian-Russian state delegations over a long 
period of time. First of all, the problems of the completion of 
the withdrawal of Russian troops from the territory of the 
Republic of Estonia and here primarily the issues which are not 
yet agreed upon. The issue connected with military pensioners. 
Also the issue of dismantling the installation at Paldiski. 
Well, and we also touched on other questions -- general 
political questions which concern Estonian- Russian relations. 
  Rhohtuleht, Ille Gruen-Ots (in Russian): What do you think, 
is the deadline August 31 realistic? 
  Churkin (in Russian): I believe there is nothing unrealistic 
about it. But there must be a firm basis, there have to be 
agreements. And then we can energetically do that which is 
necessary to complete withdrawal. 
  ITAR-TASS (in Russian): The Estonian side does not rule out 
use of force if the withdrawal is not completed by August 31. 
How do you react to this? 
  Churkin (in Russian): I do not think it is so. Regarding 
Estonian positions, then we analyze and draw conclusions based 
upon statements by responsible individuals, Estonian state 
officials. And we do not have the slightest suspicion that the 
Estonian position consists of the need to solve problems 
politically, via negotiations. I want to emphasize that the 
official position of the Russian leadership position is exactly 
the same. These questions must be solved via dialogue, not in 
any other way. 
  Q (in Russian): Did you discuss a possible meeting between 
Presidents Yeltsin and Meri? 
  Churkin (In Russian): Concretely this was not discussed. 
  Rhohtuleht (in Russian): When will you meet again? 
  Churkin (in Russian): Yes, we invited Mr. Malk and his 
colleagues -- thank you for asking this question -- to Moscow in 
the near future, as soon as this can be arranged. We believe 
that such a meeting may take place already next week. 
  Baltic Independent, Tarmu Tammerk (in English): What kinds 
of 
agreements should there be on military pensioners between 
Estonia and Russia? 
  Churkin (in English): I'd rather not go into details of our 
discussions because these are -- this is -- an on-going issue 
between us. We hope that this will -uh- be a realistic 
agreement which will remove any possibility of tensions in our 
relations and - uh- would also be up to the count very high 
international standards of human rights. 
  Lisa Trei (in English): Can you be specific about what you 
mean by realistic agreement? 
  Churkin (in English): No, I cannot. (Laughter) 
  Tammerk (in English): Will it be the point of the pull-out 
agreement? 
  Churkin (in English): I'd rather not be specific at this 
time. Thank you very much. In Russian: Thank you.

  [Text] Riigikogu Speaker Ulo Nugis made a statement at a 
news conference today, and said that he is ready to run for 
premier. The Riigikogu speaker acknowledged that the present 
crisis within the Fatherland party has transported itself to the 
Cabinet, and that there is a serious danger that this may turn 
into a constitutional crisis. Now some of his fellow thinkers 
in the republican group within the Fatherland Party have 
recommended that he should stand for the Fatherland's chairman 
and take it upon himself to form a new government, as a 
candidate for premier. According to Nugis, he sees this as a 
task from his fellow thinkers. Shirking one's responsibility 
can only be seen as a betrayal of one's ideals, said Nugis. 
  According to him, the Riigikogu has now formed the opinion 
that the Government led by Mart Laar cannot stay. In the 
opinion of the Riigikogu speaker, parliament is ready for a vote 
of no confidence in the present government, regardless of the 
outcome of the elections at the Fatherland meeting. According 
to Nugis, the government coalition is also of the same opinion.

  [Text] Tallinn, June 09, BNS -- Estonian parliament 
Chairman Ulo Nugis, who today announced his readiness to take 
over as new head of the government, also said he would not keep 
for current Prime Minister Mart Laar a post in his cabinet. 
  "I don't consider it possible that Mart Laar would be a 
minister in my government," Nugis said. 
  But, he said, adding a mellow tone, Mart Laar is a young man 
for whom the heights of life are still ahead. "I still think 
that when the current government is replaced, Laar will not be 
lost for Estonia as a politician," Nugis said. He mentioned 
that a place for Laar could be found in one of the country's 
future governments. 
  The parliament chairman said that if the president now 
proposes to him to set up a new Cabinet, it is possible that he 
will include the rest of the current ministers in his Cabinet 
list. 
  "To become a prime minister is not my ultimate goal, but it 
is a means with which I wish to resolve the government crisis 
that has energed in Estonia and avoid splitting of Pro Patria," 
Nugis said at a press conference today. 
  "Fellow members from the Republican faction of Pro Patria 
have made a proposal to me to stand as candidate for the post of 
Pro Patria chairman and, as a prime minister candidate, take 
upon myself the formation of a new government," Nugis said in 
his personal written statement released today. "Let my personal 
feelings be left aside at this point, but I take the proposal 
made by the Republicans as a task from persons with whom I share 
views," he said, adding that shirking responsibility could only 
be interpreted as an act of treachery to his ideals. 
  Nugis said a notion had emerged in the parliament that a 
government under Mart Laar cannot continue in power. In his 
words the parliament is ready to fail the current government in 
a confidence vote regardless of the outcome of the Pro Patria 
congress. He said this was also the position of the governing 
coalition. When asked how he could be so sure about this, Nugis 
said that he as the speaker of the parliament knows well his 
fellow MP's. 
  Article 97 of the Estonian Constitution gives the president 
the right to call a new general election at the government's 
proposal within three days after a vote of no-confidence in the 
government or the prime minister. Observers say it is in 
Nugis' interests that no such proposal would come from the 
current government, as this would add uncertainty to his 
prospects of becoming prime minister.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jun 09, BNS -- The head of the Russian 
delegation for talks with Lithuania confirmed that "Russia links 
the problem of transit and normal functioning of the Kaliningrad 
region to Lithuania's most favored nation trade status." 
  Viktor Isakov noted that "this is not a trap of officials or 
the (Russian) Foreign Ministry," but "the line of the country's 
leadership." 
  In an interview with the Vilnius-based Russian-language ECHO 
LITVY newspaper, Isakov commented on a round of 
Lithuanian-Russian talks that was held in Vilnius June 7-8. 
  Discussing Russian military transit, the Russian diplomat 
said Russia "is not asking anything from Lithuania,...,and does 
not demand to create some uncontrolled corridor." Isakov noted, 
however, that Russia has some things to complain about. In his 
words, "entire tank-cars of fuel disappear during transit 
through Lithuanian territory." The Russian diplomat said 
"explanations that cargos are redirected and even that mafia is 
involved are not convincing." 
  Commenting on accusations that Russia pressurizes Lithuania, 
Isakov said "not a single example of such threats and statements 
was presented by the Lithuanian side. On the contrary, threats 
to "shut in" the Kaliningrad region are already heard from the 
Lithuanian side." In Isakov's view, difficulties in talks on 
sea borders are "completely natural yet possible to overcome." 
  Isakov said assertions that Kaliningrad poses a military 
threat is a fiction, "just another card in the game of those who 
do not want improvement of relations" between Lithuania and 
Russia.

  [Text] The President of Azerbaijan Geydar Aliyev left for a 
brief working visit to Turkey today at the invitation of Turkish 
President Suleyman Demirel. The Azerbaijani president gave an 
interview to our program before staring his visit. 
  [Begin recording] [Aliyev] To answer your questions simply, 
I 
can say that the real purpose of this visit is clear. Turkey 
and Azerbaijan are very close to each other, they are friendly 
countries. We have a friendship and cooperation agreement with 
Turkey, and we are in constant touch. Many agreements were 
signed during my official visit to Turkey in February. Both we 
and Turkey are working to implement these agreements. On my 
return to Baku from Belgium, I stopped over in Ankara for a few 
hours and held talks, conversations, and consultations. 
  Our friendship and fraternal ties with Turkey are developing 
under conditions that require meetings, talks, and consultations 
from time to time. That is why Turkish President Suleyman 
Demirel invited me to Turkey. He requested that I visit him in 
Istanbul to examine various issues necessary for the continued 
cooperation between us. I accepted this invitation with 
pleasure because both Turkey and Azerbaijan need such a meeting 
at present. Therefore, I am now going to Istanbul to visit the 
Turkish president, my esteemed friend and brother Suleyman 
Demirel. I will meet him there and hold talks, and then we will 
do some other work as well. Such meetings take place not only 
in capital cities but in various cities and foreign countries. 
  As for the oil issue, the talks between the Western 
companies 
and the Azerbaijani state oil company have resumed. These talks 
are being held in Istanbul at the desired level. There is no 
need for me to go into this matter at this moment, because I 
already met with and held detailed talks with the delegation of 
the Azerbaijani State Oil Company before its departure for 
Istanbul, during which Azerbaijan's principal positions on this 
issue were established. The delegation is holding talks on the 
basis of those positions. 
  Regarding the NATO meeting, our Foreign Minister Gasan 
Gasanov has been invited there. Only foreign ministers are 
taking part in that meeting. Gasan Gasanov will represent 
Azerbaijan at that meeting, and will convey our view to it. 
  [Correspondent Seyyat Agababali] Mr. President, I want to 
ask 
a final question. You will receive Russian Defense Minister 
Pavel Grachev Saturday [11 June] morning. In the meantime, the 
Russian press has been disseminating certain views on Azerbaijan 
for the last two days. Also, in his statement today, Pavel 
Grachev said that if the Russian-sponsored plan is not signed 
during his meeting with you they will walk away from this issue. 
  [Aliyev] As you know, Pavel Grachev will arrive in Baku on 
11 
June. His statements are his own personal affair. However, the 
actual aim of his visit to Azerbaijan -- and we have held talks 
on this issue, I also held a telephone conversation with Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin -- is linked to the huge air-defense 
object in Azerbaijan--in Russian they call it radiolocatsyone 
stantsia. This is an extremely important facility, which was 
built by the Soviet Union to defend against strategic missiles. 
This is now enormously important for Russia, and it is in 
operation. 
  However, its status in Azerbaijan has not yet been 
clarified. 
That is because it is located on Azerbaijani territory, which 
means that it belongs to Azerbaijan; it is Azerbaijan's 
property. At the same time, Russia is using it. Despite the 
fact that the Soviet Union collapsed two and half years ago, 
regrettably this matter has not yet been resolved. Although 
Russia benefits from it, Azerbaijan's rights to it have not yet 
been established. Therefore, I have raised this problem to the 
Russian leadership, both to Russian President Boris Yeltsin and 
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. Grachev is coming here to 
discuss this matter. Undoubtedly, once he is here, many other 
problems will also be discussed, but one cannot comment on them 
beforehand. [end recording] 
  The Azerbaijani president was seen off at Bina airport by 
Prime Minister Suret Guseynov, Deputy Chairman of the Supreme 
Soviet Afiaddin Dzhalilov, deputy prime ministers, ministers, 
company presidents, and other officials.

  [Text] Negotiations conducted in Tehran among 
representatives of oil companies of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
and Azerbaijan Republic ended with the signing of two contracts. 
According to them, Azerbaijan oil producers must perform 
engineering-research and seismographic-exploratory work in the 
southeastern part of the Caspian Sea valued at a total of more 
than $3 million. 
  As Azerbaijan State Petroleum Company Vice President 
Khoshbakht Yusuf-zade, Doctor of Geological-Mineralogical 
Sciences, announced, business relations with the National 
Petroleum Company of the neighboring state began to develop at 
the end of the 1960's when Azerbaijani geophysicists did 
research needed by the Iranians for studying the geological 
structure of minerals in the southern part of the Caspian Sea. 
  The Azerbaijani special ships Zokhrab Veliyev and Rezonans, 
which are equipped with everything necessary for performing the 
entire complex of work under the new contracts between the oil 
companies of the two neighboring Caspian states, will soon 
depart for the southern shores of the Caspian Sea.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS special correspondents Albert Kochetkov </F>
and Mikhail Shevtsov] 
  [Text] Tbilisi, 10 Jun -- Russian Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev says that the peace-keeping mission of the Russian 
forces in Abkhazia can start immediately, if the conflicting 
sides agree to this. This will become possible if he receives 
an agreement from the Tbilisi and Gudauta leaders, with whom he 
will hold consultations throughout today. 
  In the first part of the day Grachev discussed this 
possibility with Eduard Shevardnadze, the head of the Georgian 
state, in Tbilisi, and in the afternoon he will hold similar 
talks with Vladislav Ardzinba, the Abkhazian leader, in Gudauta. 
  Incidentally, the minister added that the airborne regiment 
of the Russian Armed Forces, which is stationed in Gudauta and 
which has been officially included in the composition of the CIS 
peace-keeping forces, can be brought in for the beginning of the 
peace-keeping mission. This decision will be in keeping with 
the latest well-known edict by Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
on rendering assistance in settling the Georgian-Abkhazian 
conflict, and at the same time it does not run contrary to the 
decision of the Federation Council, which for the time being is 
holding back from carrying out a peace-keeping mission in the 
conflict zone.

<F P=106> [Unattributed NEGA report in the "Georgia" column] </F>
  [Text] Eduard Shevardnadze has signed a special edict 
whereby within the next few days a reorganization in the 
Georgian head of state's apparatus is to begin. On 8 June, 
Chief of Staff Vazha Lordkipanidze told a news conference that 
the number of apparatus staff will be cut by one-third, with all 
the subdivisions moving over to a contract system. At present 
approximately 130 people work in the apparatus. Cadre selection 
is done in accordance with two main criteria: high 
professionalism and moral integrity, regardless of affiliation 
with any political party or public movement. Lordkipanidze 
denied allegations by a number of parliamentarians that the 
apparatus' hard currency spending for foreign trips is double 
that of analogous parliament bills. "In accordance with a 
memorandum by the Georgian Finance Ministry," he said, "in 1994 
the apparatus spent $11,000 for these purposes, while parliament 
spent $12,600." The Georgian head of state's chief of staff 
also stated that contrary to some perceptions, the apparatus has 
never been bloated but corresponded to international standards 
and proportions. Moreover, Lordkipanidze said the presidential

<F P=106> [Report by Viktor Vachnadze under the "NEGA Reports" rubric: </F>
"Georgia"] 
  [Text] On 7 June Vice Prime Minister Teymuraz Basiliya 
submitted the Republic of Georgia's state budget for the second 
quarter of 1994 for parliamentary approval. The deputies 
thought the submitted budget scandalous. Deputy Bakur Gulua 
described the very attempt to propose such a budget for 
parliament's consideration as immoral and insulting. Bitter 
dissatisfaction greeted the point in the budget that speaks 
about parliament's needs -- as little as 0.3 percent is set 
aside for them. Dissatisfaction was also expressed with regard 
to the sum reserved for the head of state's staff -- 0.7 
percent. Little more than that was allowed for the entire system 
of education. "We have no use for a government that counts 
already worthless money in such an original manner," the 
parliamentarians said in almost one voice. The din in the room 
rose a notch when Basiliya gave even more totally unacceptable 
figures for the deputies: 6 percent of the budget was earmarked 
for the needs of governing the state and not more than 4 percent 
toward the Defense Ministry's enormous demands. 
  "Enough of deceiving each other," Deputy Tengiz Kitovani 
stated, and moved that discussion of the budget be postponed so 
that the head of state, the prime minister, the vice prime 
ministers, as well as the president of the National Bank and the 
finance ministers, who are away on trips at the moment, could be 
present. 
  The discussion of the budget will continue today.

  [Text] There was a report in the press yesterday to the 
effect that it had been "decided in principle that Viktor 
Chernomyrdin should resign on health grounds and Yuriy Skokov 
should be appointed to the post." It was also reported that the 
president had actually met with Yu. Skokov and the relevant 
draft edicts had now been prepared. 
  But senior officials in the Russian presidential and 
government apparatuses denied these reports. "Someone was very 
keen to destabilize the situation in the country and cause 
trouble on the threshold of the election race," I was told by 
Valeriy Grishin, deputy chief of the Russian Federation 
Government Press Service, who, incidentally, had been cited in 
the press. "I did not talk to anyone on this subject. This 
false report has reverberated worldwide. For example, we are 
being telephoned and quizzed by anxious staff of foreign 
banks.... It is just another `scenario,' which could cause the 
country material as well as psychological damage..." 
  Vyacheslav Kostikov made a very strong statement on the 
Russian president's behalf, describing the rumors as "downright 
lies. Let all the conjecture and speculation on this subject be 
on the conscience of the unscrupulous journalists and the 
politicians who are behind reports of this kind," Kostikov said.

<F P=106> [Articles by Stas Stremidlovskiy and Sergey Mashtakov under </F>
the rubric "Rumors" and the general heading: "Can There Be 
Smoke Without Fire, Or What Will Come of the Talk About 
Chernomyrdin's Resignation?"] 
  [Text] [Stremidlovskiy] Informed sources in the Russian 
Federation Government reported this week that it has been 
decided in principle by those close to Russian Federation 
President Boris Yeltsin that Viktor Chernomyrdin should resign 
as prime minister on health grounds and Yuriy Skokov should be 
appointed to the post. 
  Analysts note that this is really a natural step for Yuriy 
Skokov. Back in 1991 he occupied the post of chairman of the 
Supreme Economic Council, and then he was secretary of the 
Russian Federation Security Council. In his book Notes of 
a President Boris Yeltsin said that "Skokov is really a 
prime minister in waiting [`tenevoy' premyer-ministr]" and noted 
the great contribution he made during the August events of 1991. 
  According to the experts, the price Yuriy Vladimirovich 
would 
have to pay for the appointment as government head would be the 
guaranteed passage of the president's draft laws through the 
State Duma. When you recall that the other day Skokov signed an 
agreement in cooperation with the major deputies' group "New 
Regional Policy," which comprises 65 deputies, this would 
present no big problem. 
  [Mashtakov] The rumors that are rife about Viktor 
Chernomyrdin's possible resignation as prime minister are 
improbable for two reasons. 
  In the first place, Viktor Stepanovich has not yet had a 
major quarrel with anyone. Moreover, if you look at what his 
immediate subordinates (for example, Andrey Illarionov, head of 
the premier's analysis group, who resigned in February) have 
said, Viktor Stepanovich is held in high esteem by Boris 
Nikolayevich. 
  Second, Chernomyrdin has real political forces behind him. 
Above all, you have the military-induistrial complex, the fuel 
and energy complex, and the agro-industrial complex, whose 
leaders are linked to the premier not only by similar views but 
also by personal friendship. 
  Yuriy Skokov, who, according to the rumors, is to succeed 
Chernomyrdin as premier, is a less significant figure on the 
Russian Olympus. At best what he might have behind him is the 
support of the "New Regional Policy" parliamentary faction.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 10 Jun -- "Russia is not threatened with the 
fate of the USSR, which disintegrated. The fourth anniversary 
since the day that the declaration on the state sovereignty of 
the Russian Federation was adopted on 12 June, 1990, confirms 
that the Russian Federation, in acquiring its independence, has 
been preserved as an integral state and is continuing to grow 
stronger." This was the stand expressed by Sergey Filatov, head 
of the Russian President's administration, on the eve of the 
state holiday. 
  Filatov attributes great significance in the strengthening 
of 
the Federation to the working out of a new regional policy, 
which still has not been reinforced by the constitutions of the 
Russian republics, by the regulations of the krays and oblasts, 
and by the law on local administration, which the State Duma is 
scheduled to adopt in June. According to Filatov, the efforts 
of the state legal administration and the directorate for work 
with the territories under the Russian president, as well as of 
the Ministry for Nationalities and Regional Policy Affairs, will 
be aimed at equipping the subjects of the Federation with their 
own legislation. 
  In Filatov's opinion, adopting the bilateral treaty between 
Russia and Tatarstan -- a document that became the prologue to 
establishing new relations between the center and the subjects 
of the Federation -- was an important landmark in strengthening 
the Russian Federation. Similar agreements will be signed in 
the near future with Kabardino-Balkaria, Bashkortostan, and 
Kaliningrad Oblast, and in the future with all subjects of the 
Federation. 
  Filatov said that it was the purpose of state policy to 
achieve a "wealthy and uniform standard of living for all the 
citizens of Russia," which is only attainable in conditions 
where there is accord in society. 
  To implement the treaty on public accord, to which 854 
state, 
political, and public figures put their signatures to last 
month, a decree from Boris Yeltsin on the transformation of the 
public chamber supervised by the Russian president into a 
conciliatory coordinating body is expected in the near future.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Shalnev: "More Important Than </F>
Generals. Yuriy Baturin on the Inside of the Kremlin"] 
  [Text] When Boris Yeltsin sets off for his regular 
vacation this summer -- or fall -- Yuriy Baturin, the 
president's national security adviser, will be left "in charge" 
of the Kremlin apparatus. One aide always remains in the 
Kremlin during the vacation period, while the others all take 
the opportunity to take a breather while the president is away 
from Moscow. 
  Why Baturin exactly? Because the job description of his 
post, which was created at the end of last year, could not be 
better suited to the problems which almost traditionally arise 
when Yeltsin is on vacation. 
  Baturin, if I am not mistaken, has never yet publicly 
outlined the range of his functions and the duties which the 
president has imposed on him. 
  Conversations in the Kremlin and in a number of government 
and nongovernmental organizations and departments, however, now 
permit us to form a definite impression of what the national 
security adviser does. 
  Parallels with the United States, where national security 
advisers have automatically belonged for many decades now to 
what we call the presidential staff, would in this case be 
considerably strained. 
  For at least two reasons. In the United States the status of 
such aides is enshrined in law. In our country neither Baturin 
nor any other other presidential aide has such a status. 
Though, as it turns out, work on a Statute on Aides, which will 
subsequently be formulated as a presidential edict -- but once 
again without legislative ratification -- has been going on for 
several months now. True, the scheduled deadline for the 
preparation of the draft statute, it is said, has already 
passed, but in point of fact there is no special reason for 
haste. Everyone knows anyway that, as one high-ranking official 
told me, "the president forms his apparatus as he sees fit, and 
he is fully entitled to do so" and that, in addition, the leader 
of each department and each level of authority understands that 
the aides are the president's right-hand men, and, if anyone 
refuses to fulfill a request or requirement from an aide, "he 
will be in hot water the next day." 
  And second: Unlike the United States, where threats to 
national security, whether real or potential, stem mostly, if 
not 100-percent from without, danger to Russia's national 
interests is bounded by quite different parameters -- internal 
or peripheral. 
  Hence Baturin -- who has not, incidentally, been relieved of 
the duties linked with his previous position of adviser on legal 
questions, from which he was transferred to national security -- 
is concerned first and foremost with internal situations. 
Naturally, conflict and potentially explosive situations, 
whether it be the situation in, say, Tajikistan, or the latest 
hostage crisis in Ossetia. 
  His sphere of influence is the power structures. True, 
Baturin himself is categorically against his post being seen as, 
let alone being called, that of coordinator of the power 
ministries and departments. He prefers another term -- adviser 
[pomoshchnik]. An adviser to these structures on their contacts 
with the president, and -- not without importance -- on 
resolving the problems which these structures encounter. 
  Relations with the power structures are various. With some 
-- particularly with the Federal Counterintelligence Service, 
the Foreign Intelligence Service, the Border Guards, and the 
government communications service -- contacts are very close and 
productive. 
  Contacts with other departments are marked by problems. None 
of those with whom I spoke went into detail, still less spoke 
about the difficulties in such a way as to make it possible to 
give a direct reference to the source afterward. 
  But without direct quotations I will remark that the lack of 
enthusiasm over the creation of the post of national security 
adviser which was initially typical of all power structure 
workers, virtually without exception, and which Baturin managed 
to overcome in his relations with some of them, still remains in 
his work with the defense minister and, in particular, with the 
foreign minister. 
  Both these ministers, as is well known, are very close to 
the 
president and are accustomed to direct access to Yeltsin. 
According to certain information, Boris Yeltsin, clearly 
understanding the delicacy of the situation, is himself not 
inclined to accelerate Baturin's transformation into a broker in 
his contacts with Kozyrev and Grachev. Baturin, according to 
the comments of people who are well acquainted with his style 
and methods, is also not keen on the idea, preferring to operate 
gradually, step by step, not throwing his weight around but 
simply giving others the chance to see that he is really useful 
and necessary precisely as a connecting link with the president, 
as a man vested with the powers to resolve many questions -- 
including extremely problematic questions -- independently, 
without pestering Yeltsin. 
  Are there exceptions to these powers? Of course. The 
exceptions are situations requiring a political solution, or 
when two or three directly contradictory opinions are expressed 
on the same question. Then recourse to the president is 
inevitable; these polar options are placed on his desk and he, 
and only he, chooses the one which he considers correct and 
acceptable. 
  As if illustrating the delicacy of his relationship with the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Baturin refused outright to name 
even one foreign country whose problems -- in particular 
problems connected with these countries' relations with Russia 
-- the president has instructed him to tackle directly. To a 
certain extent, understandably, the same delicacy characterizes 
relations within the presidential apparatus itself, where, as is 
well known, the post of foreign affairs adviser, occupied by 
Dmitriy Ryurik, has existed for a long time. 
  Nevertheless, the geographical or strategic range of 
Baturin's "foreign" functions can be calculated approximately 
from the fact that, for example, the national security adviser, 
who often accompanies the president on foreign trips so as to 
"avoid confusion," intends to go with Yeltsin to Naples in July 
for the meeting of G-7 heads of state and government. 
  Continuing the theme of the difficulties which can be 
explained by purely personal factors and the traditions of 
interdepartmental bureaucratic friction, it is impossible not to 
touch on the situation, in some ways paradoxical, whereby 
alongside the president's adviser tackling national security 
problems and endowed with a small, but nevertheless his own 
staff of assistants a similar structure operates in parallel -- 
the legislatively enshrined Security Council, headed in everyday 
practical functions by Oleg Lobov and having, naturally, its own 
apparatus. 
  Relations between these two structures -- and no one has 
sought to deny this -- are strained. Lobov, considered by some 
as "Yeltsin's man," found out about Baturin's appointment, it is 
said, only from newspaper reports. However, the appointment was 
so sudden that the Security Council secretary was not the only 
one left in ignorance until the last minute. 
  But the problem, it seems to me, is not so much in possible 
personal grievances and suspicions that someone wants to 
undermine someone else. The problem is different; genetic, 
perhaps. A situation has arisen whereby two structures handling 
in principle the same questions and to some extent duplicating 
one another are forced to coexist. Competition, and all that 
competition entails, cannot be avoided. 
  For example, competition over such an apparently banal 
question as who has what access to the president. Baturin meets 
Yeltsin almost every day, Lobov -- once a week; saying, it is 
true, that such meetings are sufficient, but at once adding: "I 
would like to meet more often." 
  Or the problem of keeping informed. Baturin, all the reports 
suggest, possesses far more information possibilities than the 
Security Council, even though in theory the sources are the same 
for both. But I was told that departments and ministries share 
information, mostly of an operational nature, with the 
president's adviser even in cases when he does not specifically 
request it. The Security Council, however, informed people 
testify, mainly receives information in response to requests, 
and sometimes in the form of weighty analytical documents. But 
clear and succinct information is needed -- there is no dispute 
here -- bearing in mind in particular that the president prefers 
to deal with documents numbering two or three pages, and 
frequently just one page. 
  Incidentally: According to sources, Baturin intends to 
institute the preparation of a daily report for the president -- 
a kind of "list of threats to Russia's national security." It 
will be exactly one page in length with, it is true, more 
lengthy fact sheets appended, so that the president, if 
necessary or if he so desires, can turn to them for details. 
Relevant places in the fact sheets will be underlined and 
highlighted in advance. 
  Kremlin sources intimate that the Security Council sometimes 
looks "an unwieldy, not very resourceful organization akin to an 
academic scientific research institute, preparing rather too 
facile documents from which -- as was the case, for example, 
with Russia's military doctrine -- it is difficult to calculate 
practical tasks and, for instance, budgetary directives." The 
sources do not rule out that the same could happen with national 
security strategy, which is currently being elaborated and 
"whose adequacy cannot be vouched for." 
  Sources which, I would say, reflect the opposite side's 
opinion do not hide the fact that, if certain problems and 
situations had been passed through the Security Council and its 
apparatus, it would have been possible to avoid certain major 
blunders and miscalculations of recent times, as was the case -- 
I am quoting the sources -- with the release of the Lefortovo 
prisoners, or the furor that arose over the Russian military 
bases in the Baltic. "The decisions in that case might have been 
different," they told me. 
  Can the problem of the collaboration between these two 
structures, so similar in their functions but intrinsically 
different in their methods and the nature of their activity, be 
solved? I confess, I felt no confidence in my interlocutors' 
answers that, without radical interference from the president to 
clearly divide rights, duties, and functions between the 
Security Council and his national security adviser, spelling 
them out in detail, their coexistence will not continue to be 
marked by behind-the-scenes friction and mutual reproaches, 
which, whichever way you look at it, reflect on the efficiency 
and impact of the performance of common tasks. 
  An almost ideal option is probably the American set-up, in 
which the president's national security adviser and the National 
Security Council are an integral unit, with a single apparatus 
and combined functions. 
  Let us return, however, to Baturin's daily activity. Apart 
from everything else, this includes questions of the arms trade 
and, at the same time, weapons destruction laid down in 
international agreements and accords; questions of the 
development and consolidation of the production of those high 
technologies in which, the president's aide says, "we must in no 
event concede primacy, since otherwise we will be left 
hopelessly behind"; and problems of the defense sector. 
  Finally there is the elaboration of the doctrine, strategy, 
and concept of Russia's national security. As far as I was able 
to understand it, Baturin will finish the preliminary work at 
least by the end of the year and -- it is not ruled out -- will 
share its results with the public, in the form of a newspaper 
article, for instance. 
  In principle Baturin does not believe that the concept 
should 
be formulated in the form of some sort of signed document, 
referring, sources say, to the fact that Britain gets by 
perfectly well without a written constitution. But the 
definition and recognition of what the aide calls "Russia's 
permanent interests," which can be outlined, agreed, and 
officially recorded at a closed session of the Security Council 
and to which future generations of Russian statesmen can refer, 
is essential. 
  What are these interests? From conversations with people who 
are well acquainted with the president's aide's theoretical 
"kitchen," two areas can be seen clearly enough: "Closely 
binding together Ukraine, Belorussia [Belarus], Russia, and in 
the remote long-term Kazakhstan,"; and second, "Russia must not 
leave Central Asia; otherwise serious threats to Russia's 
security could arise there." 
  These are the elements of the basis on which strategy for 
the 
next 10 to 30 years is to be elaborated, with definitions, in 
particular, of the methods and means of achieving set tasks, and 
also the doctrine of national security for the next 50 years, 
including intelligence, military, counterintelligence, and other 
doctrines. 
  ...June 2nd was the first anniversary of Baturin's 
appointment as the president's adviser on legal questions. He 
hardly suspected then what he would be involved in by this 
anniversary, or that he would be left "in charge" during the 
president's regular vacation, since "all sorts of unpleasant 
things begin" precisely at such a time. These things are now, 
it appears, his main speciality.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Olga Semenova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 9 TASS -- All kinds of inventions 
concerning "the decisive contribution of nuclear spies, 
including agents from among Western nuclear scientists, to the 
development of nuclear weapons in this country are, to put it 
mildly, at variance with the historical truth," according to 
deputy director of the Russian external intelligence service 
Colonel-General Vyacheslav Trubnikov. 
  Trubnikov said in an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS 
about 
the place of the intelligence service in ensuring Russia's state 
sovereignty and its role in a democratic state that "the 
development of nuclear weapons in our country was a result of 
the efforts of our scientists, such as Kurchatov, Khariton, 
Zeldovich, and many others. The atom bomb is not a simple device 
that could be seen in one place and then copied at home. If our 
science had not come up close to the understanding of the secret 
of the atomic nucleus, it would have been simply unable to 
understand and evaluate the information gleaned by our 
intelligence in the nuclear field". 
  "It is now history, and when history is recorded mistakes 
are 
often made due to deliberate omissions of some things or 
deliberate highlighting of other things. The intelligence 
service does not claim other people's achievements. It has 
enough of its own. The achievement of the intelligence service 
in this case consisted in sensing in good time the important 
trend in the development of science and technology which had a 
colossal military potential and succeeded in obtaining 
information which enabled us to accelerate -- I repeat, 
accelerate -- work in the development of nuclear weapons in our 
country," Trubnikov said. 
  He said the external intelligence service is playing a 
considerable role in ensuring Russia's security, although this 
role is not always made visible. He stressed that "on the whole 
the trends in the global development are favourable for our 
country, but the spectrum of threats remains quite extensive". 
  The general said that the Russian intelligence service can 
compete quite effectively with the recognised leaders of world 
espionage as the CIA, Mossad, and the British secret service. 
"We have always been in the same league and, I want to believe, 
will remain in it always," he said. 
  General Trubnikov added that "should the personnel of our 
competitor services find themselves in conditions similar to 
those in which the Russian intelligence service is finding 
itself now, few would be able to stand it. As regards our 
people, they are serving and will continue to do so".

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report under the "Special Services" rubric: </F>
"Russian Intelligence Service in Top League"] 
  [Text] All sorts of conjectures about the decisive 
contribution made by "nuclear spies" -- which include "agents" 
from among Western nuclear scientists -- to the creation in our 
country of nuclear weapons do not correspond with the historical 
truth. This was stated by Colonel General Vyacheslav Trubnikov, 
first deputy director of the Russian Foreign Intelligence 
Service [FIS]. 
  "In reality the creation of nuclear weapons in our country 
came as a result of the efforts of our science, of such 
outstanding representatives of which as Kurchatov, Khariton, 
Zeldovich, and many others. The atomic bomb is no simple device 
you can steal a look at somewhere and then copy it back home. 
Had not our science come close to unraveling the secrets of the 
nucleus, it would simply not have been able to understand and 
appreciate the information on the range of nuclear problems that 
our intelligence service was obtaining," the general underlined. 
  Vyacheslav Trubnikov pointed out that the role of the 
Foreign 
Intelligence Service in assuring Russia's security is very 
appreciable although it is not always in the public eye. He 
also thinks that "the tendencies of world development are on the 
whole favorable for our country, while the spectrum of threats 
still remains rather broad." In his words, the Russian 
intelligence service stands up well to "competition" from such 
recognized leaders of world spying as the U.S. CIA, the Israeli 
Mosad, and the secret service of Great Britain: "We have always 
been in this league and, one would like to believe, will always 
remain in it." There he stressed: "Were the personnel of our 
"competition" in the sort of conditions the Russian intelligence 
service is at the moment, few would stand up to them. Ours 
carry on serving and will serve!"

<F P=106> [Ivan Zasurskiy report in the "Russia" column: "Luzhkov Is </F>
Not Going To Give In. He Still Considers Voucher Privatization 
a Disaster"] 
  [Text] It seemed that the battle of giants has come to 
naught: The triumphant statement by the State Property 
Management Committee [Goskomimushchestvo] Press Center, filled 
with the bombast of struggle in the course of which a revolt has 
been suppressed, speaks no more about Goskomimushchestvo's going 
to the Prosecutor's Office. The response note by the Moscow City 
Hall Press Center and Yuriy Luzhkov's statement yesterday also 
leave the mayor sticking to his anti-Chubays positions. 
  Yesterday the Moscow City Hall Press Center circulated two 
statements by Yuriy Luzhkov, one of which was devoted to 
Chubays, and the other to security (in connection with the 
attempt on Berezovskiy's life). The statement devoted to 
privatization problems reads as follows: "I must calm 
Muscovites and those Russians who are still hoping to stop the 
catastrophe initiated by Mr. Chubays' foreign experts. I state 
officially that I not only have not stopped my struggle for a 
genuinely people's privatization but, in view of new facts 
coming to light, am going to intensify it." 
  The last part of the document is an apotheosis of struggle 
for the rights of the down-and-outs: "For these and many other 
reasons I declare that a departure from our principles in this 
situation would be treachery with respect to the Muscovites." 
  The Moscow mayor's sharp statement was backed up by an 
interview in the latest issue of ARGUMENTY I FAKTY. 
  Observers have considered the battle in two dimensions: As a 
reflection of the actual economic interests of Moscow, aimed at 
addressing concrete tasks, and also as the first act in Yuriy 
Luzhkov's election campaign for the Russian presidency. 
  Therefore, if we are to sum up the objective results of the 
multi-round battles, it becomes clear that the Moscow mayor has 
failed to stand up for the interests he had in mind when issuing 
the 1 April order. Moreover, according to sources in the 
presidential entourage, Luzhkov has even found himself in a 
somewhat weaker position with respect to the president. The 
Moscow mayor apparently officially had to abandon his claims to 
the presidency. But now Luzhkov will go to the very end, while 
the next Russian president will be either Boris Yeltsin himself 
or a person who receives power from his hands. (Scenarios for a 
tough political struggle and/or coups is a subject of separate 
conversation). 
  So, what has Yuriy Luzhkov won? I venture to say that 
politically he has made considerable gains. In fact we have 
witnessed the Moscow mayor's first step from the position of a 
regional leader to the status of a national leader concerned not 
only about city problems. Any division of property in the end 
leads to its concentration in the hands of the minority, while 
the majority gets rich only in the process of steady economic 
development. Yuriy Luzhkov opposed voucher privatization in a 
loud and scandalous way, combining TV appearances with 
interviews circulated in 6.26 million copies. His arguments are 
simpler and more clear-cut than the positions of many opposition 
leaders who have not reached a common opinion and have weak 
publicity. Is there any need to say how this is important to a 
future contender in an election campaign, especially if the 
Moscow mayor's newly found charisma does not prevent him from 
remaining the president's trusted person? Should Yeltsin 
recognize that Luzhkov is right, Anatoliy Chubays, at the end of 
privatization, will be left one to one with the vouchers and 
their holders.

<F P=106> [Abridged Statement by A.B. Vengerov, chairman of the Court </F>
of Appeal for Information Disputes: "Court of Appeal for 
Information Disputes Under the Russian Federation President 
Ruling No. 15 `On the Violation of Legal and Ethical Norms in 
ZAVTRA Articles,' dated 2 June 1994, Moscow"] 
  [Text] The Court of Appeal for Information Disputes under 
the Russian Federation President, after examining the contents 
of a ZAVTRA article entitled "World Roguery" (Nos. 15-16, 1994), 
and having heard the expert conclusions of M.A. Melnikov and 
S.A. Modestov, the statement by the Russian Federation Ministry 
of Justice, the warning to the newspaper ZAVTRA from the Russian 
Federation Committee for Printed Materials [Roskompechat], the 
speech by S.P. Gryzunov, deputy chairman of the Russian 
Federation Committee for Printed Materials, and explanations 
from ZAVTRA's Deputy Chief Editor V.G. Bondarenko, has 
established: 
  That the Court of Appeal has already issued a statement on 
articles in ZAVTRA which violate legal and ethical norms, 
particularly the item by I. Andronov entitled "Secrets of the 
Kremlin" in which the chamber noted an abuse by the ZAVTRA 
editorial team of the freedom of mass information, and a 
violation of Paragraph 4 of the Russian Federation Law "On the 
Mass Media." (See Court of Appeal Statement No. 1 of 4 April 
1994, published in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, 13 April, 1994....) 
  ZAVTRA's editorial team ignored the Court of Appeal's 
statement of 4 April 1994 and it continues the publication of 
materials consituting a gross violation of legal and ethical 
norms. 
  The interview with A. Zinovyev, carried under the heading 
"World Roguery" (Nos. 15 and 16, 1994), contains direct calls 
for unleashing war, the violent overthrow of constitutional 
order, the inflamation of social and national intolerance and 
hostility.... 
  An analysis conducted by the Court of Appeal into the item 
"World Roguery" concludes that ZAVTRA violated a number of legal 
and ethical norms: "The Declaration of Human Rights and 
Freedoms" (Article 4), the Russian Federaion Constitution 
(Article 29), the Russian Federation Law "On the Mass Media" 
(Article 4). The application for ZAVTRA's registration is at 
notable variance with the actual content of many of the 
newspaper's items. 
  Considering the aforestated, and guided by Articles 4, 9, 
and 
20 of the Statute on the Court of Appeal, the Court of Appeal 
has decided: 
  1. To recognize that the article "World Roguery" published 
in the newspaper ZAVTRA constitutes an abuse of the freedom of 
mass information: It contains calls for the physical removal of 
a number of state figures, advocates war, inflames social and 
ethnic enmity, insults the Russian Federation president, and 
denigrates and humiliates persons mentioned in the article, 
which constitutes a gross violation of Article 4 of the Russian 
Federation Law "On the Mass Media." 
  2. To take cognizance of the fact that the Russian 
Federation Committee for Printed Matter has submitted an 
official warning to ZAVTRA in respect of the article "World 
Roguery," while the Russian Federation General Prosecutor's 
Office has instigated criminal proceedings pertaining to 
evidence of crimes which entail liability for calls for the 
forcible alteration of the constitutional order and for the 
propaganda of war. 
  3. To recommend that the Russian Federation Committee for 
Printed Matter return to the question of adopting measures 
provided for by law in respect of the article by I. Andronov 
entitled "Secrets of the Kremlin" in the newspaper ZAVTRA (No. 
11). 
  4. To propose that the Russian Federation Committee for 
Printed Matter review the correlation between the application by 
the newspaper's founder for its registration and the actual 
content of the articles in line with Article 15 of the Russian 
Federation Law "On the Mass Media." 
  [Signed] A.B. Vengerov, Chairman of the Court of Appeal.

Yeltsin signed a decree on Friday lifting certain limitations 
earlier imposed by him on the activities of foreign banks in 
Russia. 
  Yeltsin made the announcement at a press conference on 
Friday 
admitting that the decree would cause sharp criticisms of 
Russian bankers who fear foreign banking giants can swallow them 
up. 
  He did not provide any details, but said it is necessary to 
ensure a gradual access of foreign banks to Russia in order to 
stimulate the necessary competition. 
  It is no longer possible to tolerate the 185 per cent 
discount rate offered by Russian banks, according to the 
president, who added that the presence of foreign banks would 
bring the rate down.

  [Text] Moscow -- An initiative group has been created in 
the State Duma to formulate a law on compensation of Savings 
Bank deposits made by the population before the freeing of 
prices in January 1992. Grigoriy Bondarev, a "Yabloko" faction 
deputy and one of those who first formed the idea for the future 
law, has said the possibility of compensation in stocks, 
enterprises, apartments, and even service facilities up for 
privatization, rather than in money, is being considered. 
Well-known jurists from the Moscow Private Law Center have been 
asked to draft the law. Bondarev said, however, that the 70 
million affected depositors "should not celebrate victory yet." 
According to him, the idea for such compensation is being 
worked on at the State Committee for the Management of State 
Property but "with no special enthusiasm."

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Chernyshova, with recorded comments </F>
by O. Soskovets, first deputy chairman of the Russian Council of 
Ministers, from the 9 June government session; from the 
"Novosti" newscast] 
  [Excerpts] [Chernyshova] Russian enterprises' output 
between January and May this year was depressingly low. 
Production in real terms declined in comparison with the same 
period last year by 26 percent. One can only wonder what was 
then the general decline in production for the whole period of 
reforms, for example, since 1991. 
  [Soskovets] In some enterprises production fell by up to 80 
percent, in some by 50 percent. 
  [Chernyshova] Out of 406 of the most important categories of 
products only 20 types have shown some progress. Production of 
the rest, which make up the other 94 percent, is badly declining 
by more than a third. The machine-building industry is the 
worst hit. Production here declined by 45 percent. Many 
enterprises stand still and their number increases every month. 
In May there were 5,500. 
  [Passage omitted: Some of the problems are explained by the 
seeming unwillingness of the Russian manufacturers to improve 
their products so as to successfully compete with imported goods] 
  [Soskovets] The positive discrimination against the imported 
machines does not make sense. We have somehow overlooked this 
important aspect of industrial relations during our reforms -- 
that is, discipline -- not only at the enterprises and in 
industry but in the government as well. I think the work should 
begin here.

  [Text] First Vice Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets believes 
that the word "crisis" should be prevalent while describing the 
current situation in Russian industry. He made this statement 
at a government meeting in Moscow Thursday. 
  Soskovets harshly criticized the leaders of some federal 
ministries and agencies, including the Machine-Building 
Committee and the Atomic Energy Ministry, for poor discipline 
and feeble control over the situation in specific branches. 
Commenting on the performance of a number of federal executive 
bodies, he said "We are doing our job very badly." 
  Soskovets said the government meeting had summed up the 
results of its performance in the first half of the year. "There 
are no outstanding success in the sphere of industrial 
production, an unbiased assessment is needed," he said, adding 
"the movement of reforms will depend on how we use the executive 
power we are entrusted with." 
  Soskovets said Russia had lost its positions on the world 
arms market. Soviet arms exports totalled 30 percent of the 
world market compared to the USA's 35 percent. 
  Now the situation has thoroughly changed, he said. Russia's 
exports amount for a mere five percent, while the U.S.A. 
controls 65 percent of the world arms market. "We have suffered 
great losses in this area, it is necessary to restore our 
positions gradually, step by step," Soskovets said.

  [Text] Moscow, June 9 (TASS) -- "Privatisation in Russia 
has been carried through," said chairman of the Russian 
committee for state property, Anatoliy Chubays, an interview to 
the "Publicist" studio broadcast by the First Television Channel 
on Thursday. 
  According to Chubays, "the privatisation has been carried 
out 
despite numerous experts' forecasts and stormy political 
developments around it." 
  At the same time, Chubays believes that as far as the state 
property committee is concerned, and for him personally, the 
goal of privatisation goes far beyond the framework of 
privatisation itself. He described privatisation as a very deep 
process "which modifies processes taking place in an economic 
organism at a molecular level." 
  According to Chubays, a total of 70 percent of Russian 
enterprises will be auctioned for vouchers, 20 percent for money 
and 10 percent will not be subject to privatisation at all. 
According to Chubays, enterprises excluded from monetary and 
voucher privatisation include those connected with the 
production of nuclear splitting materials, cipher equipment and 
special kinds of armaments.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Velichko] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 9 TASS -- The bill "on the state support 
of small businesses in the Russian Federation," which was 
discussed by the Russian Government today ahead of its 
consideration in the parliament, is designed to give more 
freedom to the Russian people in the use of their 
entrepreneurial abilities. This was said by Chairman of the 
Russian Anti-Monopoly Committee Leonid Bochin during the 
government meeting on Wednesday. 
  The number of employees of a small business in the industry 
and construction was fixed at 200 people, in agriculture and 
other branches of production, wholesale trading, science and 
scientific services at 50, and in retail trading and the 
non-production sphere at 15. 
  Natural persons engaged in entrepreneurial activity without 
obtaining the status of a legal person are also regarded as 
small businesses. 
  Leonid Bochin said the state support of small businesses 
will 
take the form of a simplified procedure for registering and 
licencing their activity, support for their foreign economic 
activity, the organisation of training and retraining, as well 
as the provision of easy access to financial, material, 
technical and information resources. 
  The new law stipulates that no state support will be 
extended 
to small businesses in which one or several legal persons hold 
shares of the authorised capital in excess of 25 percent. 
Annually at least 0.5 percent of the total spending from the 
federal, regional and local budgets will be alloted to support 
small businesses. Taxes will be levied on small businesses in 
the five first years of their activity, but some tax breaks are 
envisioned. 
  The government approved the bill on the whole and decided to 
send it to the State Duma after putting final touches to it, 
taking into account critical remarks and proposals made during 
the discussion.

  [Text] In Friday's opening address to a national conference 
on housing policies under free-market relations Russia's First 
Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets said that in a bid to stabilize the 
sphere of housing construction with the help of private 
investment, President Yeltsin has signed a packet of new 
decrees. The conference opened in the State Palace of the 
Moscow Kremlin. President Yeltsin is attending its sittings. 
  Soskovets said Yeltsin signed a decree on housing loans, a 
decree on construction certificates and a decree on the sale of, 
and commercial investment in, unfinished construction projects. 
  According to Soskovets, the national budget revenue in the 
first five months of 1994 fell 5.2 trillion rubles short of its 
target. He felt economic recovery depended, in great measure, on 
investment in housing construction. He said the government must 
offer private entrepreneurs reliable, including state, 
guarantees for investment in that field. 
  A second packet of legislation on more economic reform is in 
the making and legal moves are being made to reduce, as of 1996, 
basic, including profit and value added, taxes by 10 to 20 
percent, Soskovets said. The government, he said, also intends 
to hold tenders among those wishing to sell products to the 
state and intends to sell part of unfinished construction 
projects to private entrepreneurs in a bid to lure more private 
investment into the industry.

  [Text] Moscow June 9 -- The favorable balance in Russia's 
foreign trade continued to grow in January-May this year and 
amounts now to 9.7 billion U.S. dollars, a spokesman for the 
ministry of foreign trade relations of the Russian Federation 
told BUSINESS-TASS on Thursday. 
  The total volume of export in five months of 1994 was 16.8 
billion U.S. dollars which is 9 percent higher than at the 
similar period in 1993. 
  Export to industrialized countries also continued to 
increase 
and totaled 10.3 billion U.S. dollars, 8.6 percent more as 
compared with the similar period of the past year. Export to 
developing countries was 2.2 billion U.S. dollars, to the former 
Comecon countries -- 2.7 billion U.S. dollars and to other 
countries -- 1.6 billion U.S. dollars. 
  The trend towards the growth in export of main raw materials 
remained. For instance, oil export in five months of 1994 rose 
10 percent, oil products -- 17 percent and natural gas -- 14 
percent. 
  Deliveries of fish, iron ore, ammonia, methanol, 
fertilizers, 
timber, cast iron and non-ferrous metals exceeded the last 
year's level. Aluminium export almost doubled as compared with 
1993. 
  Russia's import in January-May of 1994 amounted to 7.1 
billion U.S. dollars which is 28 percent less than at the 
similar period of the last year. 
  Especially sharp fall -- 44 percent was registered in the 
volume of purchases in developing countries. Import from 
industrialized countries was 4.7 billion U.S. dollars, 18 
percent down as compared with the first five months of 1993. 
Grain import reduced by 94 percent and only 411,000 tons were 
imported in five months. 
  Import deliveries of flour and macaroni reduced 75-90 
percent. Foreign purchases of vegetable oil, coffee, tea, 
rubber, sugar and clothes fell 25-50 percent as compared with 
five months of 1993. At the same time import of butter, dry 
milk, meat, including poultry somewhat grew. 
  Import of aluminium raw materials, alloy steel, steel pipes, 
furniture and some other commodities remained above the last 
year's level.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Agricultural Products Purchase </F>
Prices May Rise"] 
  [Text] Purchase prices for 1994 agricultural produce in 
the Russian Federation may almost triple, Ministry of 
Agriculture price policy board experts believe. Calculated on 
the basis of current market prices and on the expected level of 
inflation, purchase prices will amount to: about 220,000 rubles 
[R] per one tonne of wheat; R350,000 per one tonne of sunflower; 
R70,000 per one tonne of sugar beet; and R200,000 per one tonne 
of potatoes. According to the experts' count, these prices will 
ensure profitability of wheat and sunflower (121 and 125 percent 
correspondingly). Potatoes (with profitability at 24 percent) 
and sugar beet (at 8 percent) are proving to be unprofitable. 
The document underlines that prices of agricultural produce 
will be determined by those who sell and buy it, and their 
regulation by state organs is not permitted.

<F P=106> [Article by Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian Federation </F>
minister of defense, under the "At First Hand" rubric: 
"Military Doctrine and Russia's Security. Nuclear Weapons Are 
a Means of Deterring Any Aggression Against the Russian 
Federation"] 
  [Text] From the moment of their adoption, the "Basic 
Provisions of the Russian Federation Military Doctrine" have 
been actively discussed in various political circles and on the 
pages of the Russian and world press. 
  Given this constant interest, I deem it expedient to explain 
to the public in more detail the essence of the most important 
doctrinal provisions and the characteristics of our state's 
contemporary military-political and geostrategic position, which 
determine the fundamental approaches to ensuring Russia's 
national security. 
  As we know, following the collapse of the Soviet Union and 
the formation of a number of independent states on its 
territory, Russia's state-legal status has changed radically. 
It has become an autonomous subject of international relations, 
the USSR's successor as permanent member of the UN Security 
Council, and one of the five world nuclear powers. 
  The cardinal changes in the geopolitical and military 
strategic situation in the world, the new nature and system of 
international relations, and the creation of Russian Armed 
Forces have put before Russia the task of elaborating and 
adopting a fundamentally new national military doctrine. 
  On the one hand, the end of the confrontation which had 
proceeded under the sign of the struggle between two systems, 
with its projection onto all aspects of international life, has 
not only reduced the threat of global war but has laid down the 
preconditions for establishing constructive cooperation between 
states which were previously confronting each other and for a 
fundamentally new relationship between Russia and the world 
around it. 
  However, it must be clearly understood that these new 
relations do not by any means rule out the emergence of 
differences and contradictions, which at times are quite sharp. 
  The main thing, in our view, is that they should be resolved 
and settled within the framework of normal collaboration between 
states, with the specific nature of national interests taken 
into account. 
  On the other hand, attention must be paid to the relatively 
high level of tension in individual regions of the world. The 
probability of local and regional wars continues to exist, as 
well as of armed conflicts within individual states on the basis 
of national-ethnic, territorial, religious, and other 
contradictions. A particularly dangerous challenge to regional 
and international stability is the presented by the growth of 
aggressive nationalism in various regions of the world. 
  From the very beginning of work on the military doctrine it 
was absolutely clear that what had to be done was not simply to 
amplify military-doctrinal views which existed in the Soviet 
period but to elaborate fundamentally new stances and approaches. 
  Essentially for the first time we stated that we would 
protect not the ideology but the vitally important interests of 
the country, which do not affect the security of other states in 
any way and are ensured within the framework of mutually 
advantageous interstate relations based on equal rights. 
  The cornerstone of our military doctrine is the provision 
that Russia does not regard any state as its enemy. This has 
brought about the need for a radical review of approaches to the 
entire spectrum of problems of military-organizational 
development. 
  During the elaboration of the doctrine's provisions and the 
determination of the Armed Forces' tasks the country's real 
possibilities at the current phase of its development were taken 
into account to the maximum degree, as well as Russia's 
international commitments to the reduction of nuclear and 
conventional weapons and its participation in peacekeeping 
operations. 
  All this taken together has exerted a considerable influence 
on the formation of Russian military doctrine. 
  In accordance with concepts which exist in our country, the 
military doctrine represents a system of views, officially 
adopted in the state, on wars, armed conflicts, their 
prevention, military-organizational development, the preparation 
of the country for defense, the building and training of the 
Armed Forces and other Russian Federation troops, and the 
procedure and methods for using them to protect the vitally 
important interests of the Russian Federation. 
  Naturally, the listed questions are reflected in the 
country's Constitution, laws, decisions, and decrees of the top 
organs of state power and are fleshed out in concepts and plans 
for the organizational development of the Armed Forces, 
regulations, manuals, and other documents. 
  The "Basic Provisions of the Russian Federation Military 
Doctrine," which are of a most general and conceptual nature, 
have made it possible to unite all these legislative acts and 
departmental documents in a single whole, a kind of "military 
constitution." For the first time in our country's history, 
this document was thoroughly examined at a number of sittings of 
the Russian Federation Security Council and ratified by Russian 
President B.N. Yeltsin. Thus the "Basic Provisions of Military 
Doctrine" are an official normative-legal document, a 
constituent component of the Concept of Russian Federation 
Security, and represent a "document of the transitional 
period -- the period of the formation of Russian statehood, the 
implementation of democratic reforms, and the formation of a new 
system of international relations." In other words, the 
adopted Basic Provisions of Military Doctrine constitute not 
dogma but a document open to relevant revision as the 
military-political situation develops. It is intended to ensure 
the implementation of a minimum of two basic functions. 
  The main function is normative. The Basic Provisions of 
Military Doctrine are very close to and in a number of spheres 
coincide with the category of juridical law, since they are 
binding on all organs of state power and administration which 
take part in ensuring the country's defense capability. The 
doctrinal provisions determine the state's tasks in the sphere 
of ensuring military security, the aims and tasks of using the 
Armed Forces, and other questions. Apart from that, they aim 
the country's economy, particularly its defense sectors, toward 
providing for the needs of the Armed Forces and other troops and 
determine the priority spheres for developing science and 
technology in the interests of defense, the preparation of the 
population and the state as a whole to repel aggression, and 
also a number of other measures relating to this sphere. 
  Another function, the informative function, is also highly 
significant. The military doctrine enables the peoples of our 
country and the world community to correctly understand Russia's 
aims and tasks in the sphere of the struggle to avert possible 
armed conflicts and wars and in preparations for repulsing 
possible aggression against Russia and protecting its vital 
interests. 
  Structurally speaking, the Basic Provisions of Military 
Doctrine are made up of a preface, political, military, 
military-technical, and economic sections, and also a concluding 
section. 
  The political principles of the military doctrine reflect 
two 
interconnected tasks -- the prevention of war, and readiness to 
repulse an aggressor. 
  Russia rejects any war, use of military force, or threat of 
force as means of achieving political, economic, and other aims. 
It advocates the adoption of commitments by all states not to 
use military force first and adheres to the principles of the 
inviolability of state borders and noninterference in the 
internal affairs of other states. All questions under dispute 
should be resolved only by political and diplomatic means. 
  As I have already noted, the political principles of the 
military doctrine indicate for the first time that the Russian 
Federation sees no state as its enemy. I will say 
frankly that for us the professional military, who have gotten 
used to having the most specific of guidelines, this turn of 
events has created a lot of additional difficulties. Primarily 
we had to retune ourselves psychologically, but there were also 
difficulties of what I would call a technical nature. This 
primarily concerns questions of strategic planning, the 
instruction and training of cadres, and, finally, the 
determination of the defense budget. Today we are building our 
defense policy, gearing ourselves to taking existing and 
potential threats into account. These are expounded fairly 
fully in the doctrine. While Russia has no enemies, like any 
state, it has its vitally important interests. We are capable 
and prepared to protect them. 
  Now, something about nuclear weapons. This 
section, as might have been expected, has generated heightened 
interest and the greatest number of opinions. 
  It must be noted that one of the paradoxes of the nuclear 
age 
is the fact that nuclear weapons, accumulated in the arsenals of 
the opposing sides in the Cold War, have transferred to a new 
form of existence as a political instrument of mutual 
deterrence against the unleashing of large-scale war. The 
inevitability of a world catastrophe occurring if the 
accumulated nuclear arsenals are put into operation is 
universally recognized. But imposing certain rules in the game 
of nuclear weapons on each other, like their selective, group, 
or demonstrational use, has proved to be an insoluble task for 
political strategies. Nuclear deterrence itself is 
essentially based on the scale of uncertainty concerning a 
nuclear response to aggression. 
  Following the end of the Cold War, when significant changes 
occurred in the disposition of geopolitical forces in the world, 
particularly in the Eurasian area, the policy of nuclear 
deterrence has been gaining new substance for Russia, and indeed 
for the United States and NATO. 
  The military confrontation between East and West, vastly 
inflated by the arsenals of strategic and operational-tactical 
nuclear weapons that were among those formed in the course of 
the Cold War years, has objectively been cancelled out. With 
the destruction of the bipolar geostrategic structure of the 
world, the question arose for Russia on the one hand and the 
United States and NATO on the other hand of transforming their 
own nuclear concepts and strategies. 
  Furthermore, in the present conditions the problem of 
preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other types 
of mass destruction weapons has also arisen sharply. At 
present, apart from the five nuclear states which have 
officially enshrined their status as possessors of nuclear 
weapons in the Nonproliferation Treaty, there are somewhere in 
the region of 10 countries in the world which are on the 
threshold of producing them. As a rule, they are countries 
which are located in regions with an unstable military-political 
climate. The advance of these countries toward nuclear weapons 
is accompanied by the concentration of their efforts on the 
acquisition of rocket and aviation technologies with the aim of 
creating delivery vehicles. If this process is not stopped, 
then soon we may see real rather than potential possessors of 
nuclear arsenals who are seriously impressive by regional 
yardsticks. 
  In this connection I consider it necessary to stress that 
the 
countries of the unpublicized "nuclear club" form a fairly dense 
half-circle, embracing, from the south, the geostrategic space 
occupied by Russia and its closest neighbors, creating a vague 
zone of "nuclear risk." That is why Russia's policy of nuclear 
deterrence must fully meet this circumstance. 
  Furthermore, it is necessary to bear in mind that with the 
contemporary development of means of armed struggle, including 
precision weapons, even with the use of conventional weapons our 
nuclear potential could be reduced in warfare to a level whereby 
it could not carry out its deterrent role. 
  This was reflected in the section of the doctrine devoted to 
nuclear weapons, where it says that "the aim of the 
Russian Federation's policy in the sphere of nuclear weapons is 
to eliminate the danger of a nuclear war by deterrence against 
the unleashing of aggression against the Russian Federation and 
its allies." 
  In full accordance with the aforementioned aim, we do not 
view nuclear weapons as a means of conducting military actions, 
but as a means of deterrence against the unleashing of 
aggression. Russia has not resolved to confirm the commitment on 
non-first use of nuclear weapons which the Soviet Union had 
declared in the past. This commitment contradicts the task of 
deterrence. I would like to stress once again that a rejection 
of no-first use of nuclear weapons in no way means a switch to 
the concept of the preemptive use of nuclear weapons but 
demonstrates a resolve to avert the unleashing of a large-scale 
war against the Russian Federation and its allies. I quote: 
"The Russian Federation will not use its Armed Forces and 
other troops against any state except for individual or 
collective self-defense if an armed attack is carried out 
against the Russian Federation, its citizens, territory, Armed 
Forces, or other troops, or its allies." That is why there can 
be no question of any first use of a preemptive nuclear strike, 
since the strategic nuclear forces are a constituent component 
of the Armed Forces. 
  The military doctrine also contains the following 
provisions: 
  "The Russian Federation will not use its nuclear weapons 
against any state participating in the Treaty on the 
Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons dated 1 July 1968 which does 
not possess nuclear weapons except in the following cases: 
  a) an armed attack by that state, linked by an alliance 
agreement with a state possessing nuclear weapons, against the 
Russian Federation, its territory, Armed Forces, and other 
troops, or its allies; 
  b) joint actions by such a state with a state possessing 
nuclear weapons to implement or support an invasion or an armed 
attack on the Russian Federation, its territory, Armed Forces, 
and other troops or allies." 
  What do we have in mind here? First of all, when adopting a 
decision to begin aggression against Russia it is necessary for 
any state, including a non-nuclear state, to think about the 
possible consequences of this step. 
  Second, it is necessary to restrict to the maximum degree 
the 
possibility of an expansion in the scale of aggression against 
Russia, including doing so by means of the participation of 
nonnuclear states in it. 
  References to states possessing nuclear weapons are included 
in both cases because at present and in the foreseeable future 
there is not a single nonnuclear state in the world whose 
autonomous aggression would constitute a serious danger to 
Russia. 
  In a number of countries there are concerns that Russia may 
make first use of nuclear weapons even in a very restricted 
conflict. This is not true! Russia is categorically opposed to 
any use, even the restricted use, of nuclear weapons in warfare 
even by one of the sides, which "may provoke the mass use 
of nuclear weapons and cause catastrophic consequences." 
Furthermore, the document stresses that Russia "aspires to a 
reduction in nuclear forces to a minimum level, which would 
guarantee the prevention of a large-scale war and the 
maintenance of strategic stability and, in the future, to the 
complete elimination of nuclear weapons." From the 
political viewpoint, the principle of the use of nuclear weapons 
expounded in the document places Russia on an equal footing with 
other nuclear countries and will serve as an incentive for the 
further reduction and nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. 
  In respect of other types of mass destruction weapons, 
Russia's policy remains unchanged and is aimed at promoting the 
full implementation of the Convention Prohibiting Chemical and 
Biological Weapons as well as at preventing the production of 
new types of mass destruction weapons. 
  In accordance with the doctrine, the Russian Federation's 
military security is ensured by the totality of the means at its 
disposal. And although, as I have already said above, priority 
is given to political-diplomatic and other peaceful methods, the 
Russian Federation deems it necessary to possess Armed Forces 
and deems it lawful to use them for the protection of the 
Russian Federation's sovereignty, territorial integrity, and 
other vitally important interests in the event of aggression 
being committed against it or its allies. In the present 
conditions, in our opinion, political efforts can be effective 
only if they are supported by a military might that is 
sufficient for defense. 
  According to our assessment, there is practically no direct 
military threat today. But a military danger remains. This is 
confirmed by an analysis of the existing and potential sources 
of it and reasons for it. 
  The basic spheres and principles of ensuring the Russian 
Federation's military security are determined on the basis of 
the given analysis. 
  They are: 
  -- the development of a system of bilateral and multilateral 
agreements between states, and Russia's membership in collective 
security structures, or the establishment of cooperation 
relations with such structures; 
  -- the improvement of existing international mechanisms for 
the monitoring of the proliferation of mass destruction weapons 
and delivery vehicles and the creation of effective new 
mechanisms; 
  -- the creation of conditions for the permanent action of 
the 
Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons and also the 
adoption of measures to expand the number of participants in 
that treaty; 
  -- the expansion of confidence-building measures in the 
military sphere, including the exchange of information of a 
military nature on a mutual basis and the coordination of 
military doctrines and plans for military organizational 
development with allies and partners. 
  Special attention is being paid to implementing the Treaty 
on 
Conventional Armed Forces in Europe dated 19 November 1990 and 
giving assistance to the inclusion of Asian states and states in 
other regions in the world in the process of restricting and 
reducing armed forces and weapons. 
  I particularly want to talk about the latter problem. Let me 
remind you that the CFE Treaty was formulated in conditions of 
inflexible confrontation between two systems. That is why 
provisions regarding regional partition and flank restrictions 
on weapons and hardware were incorporated in it. 
  The main idea of the treaty was geared toward reducing the 
dangerous concentration of weapons along the line of contact 
between the Warsaw Pact and NATO groupings. However, with the 
breakup of the USSR the situation changed dramatically owing to 
the distribution of weapons levels stipulated by the treaty 
among the successor states. Now the terms of the treaty dealing 
with flank restrictions have not only lost their political and 
military significance but have in fact taken on a discriminatory 
character with respect to Russia. For example, they directly 
affect the state's security interests in the south. 
  Instability in the Caucasus and neighboring regions and the 
growth of separatism and extremism necessitate a significant 
Russian military presence in the North Caucasus region in order 
to prevent and deter potential conflicts and insure against 
destabilization of the situation on the European continent as a 
whole. At the same time Russia needs flank restrictions in 
order to concentrate the bulk of its weapons and military 
hardware along an "East-West" line, as during the Cold War and 
the confrontation between the two blocs. 
  Russia's proposals to resolve the problems of flank 
restrictions do not prejudice the security of any European 
state, and they are in keeping with the treaty principle of 
equal rights and responsibilities for all signatories. 
  I believe that Russia is entitled to expect a different 
attitude to Paragraph 5 of the CFE Treaty. However, the lack of 
a solution to the problem of flank restrictions can be viewed as 
evidence that by no means everyone has yet jettisoned the 
bloc-style thinking of the Cold War era. 
  Russia believes that the main principles for resolving its 
military security problems are the maintenance of stability in 
the regions adjoining its borders and compliance with 
international commitments. At the same time the doctrine 
indicates that Russia's security should be protected without 
prejudice to other countries' security or the security system as 
a whole. 
  Regarding the matter of maintaining international peace and 
security and preventing wars and armed conflicts, the Russian 
Federation views as partners all states whose policies do not 
prejudice its interests or contradict the UN Charter. A 
priority for us is to establish cooperation within the CIS -- 
cooperation with its members in resolving problems of collective 
defense and security and coordinating military policy and 
defense building. 
  At the present time we are formulating a blueprint for 
collective security within the CIS framework. The basis for 
this is the Collective Security Treaty. It is becoming 
increasingly evident that no state in the Commonwealth can 
develop normally in various spheres without close integration. 
And there is no sense in looking for the notorious "hand of 
Moscow" or a new "imperialist thinking" on Russia's part. This 
is an objective assessment of present realities. We favor an 
equal pooling of efforts by all CIS member states in order to 
resolve problems that arise. 
  On a regional level, Russia is implementing cooperation 
with CSCE member countries and other states and 
military-political structures in adjacent regions which have an 
existing or nascent collective security system. But here too 
there is a major peculiarity. Russia is not just a European but 
also an Asian state. Consequently, in order to protect our 
security and vital interests we cannot retire into Europe alone; 
we must make efforts to establish collective security systems in 
other regions too, including the Asia-Pacific region. 
  On the global scale, Russia cooperates with all UN member 
states, primarily within the framework of the UN Security 
Council, on the basis of the principles and norms of 
international law. 
  The doctrine also confirms that Russia is carrying out its 
international commitments as regards providing military 
assistance to allied countries and participating in peacekeeping 
operations. The Russian Federation believes that implementing 
the actions of the UN Security Council and other collective 
security organs with regard to maintaining or restoring 
international peace is an important task. It is in Russia's 
interests that armed conflicts which flare up in the world 
should be averted by political means or halted at the earliest 
possible stage of development. Here it is apposite to note that 
we are keen to formulate a contractual and legal basis for 
relations with NATO in the spheres of averting crises and 
peacekeeping, primarily with regard to the problem of adopting 
coordinated decisions to use peacekeeping forces, and also 
regarding other aspects of practical military cooperation with 
the alliance. 
  And now to the actual military side of the doctrine. At the 
present time and for the foreseeable future, the likelihood of a 
nuclear war or conventional world war breaking out has been 
significantly reduced. But the possibility of armed conflicts 
and local or regional wars flaring up not only remains but is 
unfortunately growing. Under certain circumstances such 
conflicts could escalate into a large-scale (world) war. 
  The military doctrine therefore defines it as the main 
objective of the use of the Russian Federation's Armed Forces in 
armed conflicts and local wars to rapidly localize a source of 
tension and stop hostilities at the earliest possible stage in 
the interests of creating prerequisites for settling a conflict 
by peaceful means in line with Russia's interests. 
  We are particularly concerned by the continuing possibility 
that wars waged merely with conventional weapons will escalate 
into wars where nuclear weapons might be used. Factors which 
could exacerbate this danger are first and foremost premeditated 
actions by an aggressor designed to destroy or disrupt the 
functioning of strategic nuclear forces, missile attack early 
warning systems, nuclear power industry installations, and 
nuclear and chemical facilities. Apart from the strategic 
significance, the destruction of such targets could have 
irreparable environmental consequences. This could mean not one 
but hundreds or thousands more Chernobyls. 
  The tasks of the Armed Forces and other Russian Federation 
forces are set out in the fundamental principles of the 
doctrine. It is important to note at this point that alongside 
traditional tasks such as participation in averting wars and 
armed conflicts, deterring potential aggressors from starting 
wars, and repulsing aggressors, for the first time the document 
formulates a number of new tasks. 
  These are, first and foremost, carrying out peacekeeping 
operations in line with decisions by the UN Security Council and 
other collective security organs, or under other international 
commitments if these do not contradict the interests of the 
Russian Federation. 
  Responsibility for future peace and the success of the 
economic and political reforms that have been initiated is 
prompting the Russian Federation to step up its participation in 
the process of settling crisis situations. The political need 
for this aspect of Russia's activity stems primarily from its 
interest in developing into a sovereign, independent, democratic 
state. Russia also recognizes its own special responsibility 
for ensuring peace and security, imposed on it by its permanent 
membership of the UN Security Council. Russia fully endorses 
and supports the Security Council recommendation that all states 
should view their participation in international operations 
designed to maintain peace as an element of their foreign and 
national security policy. 
  In accordance with this, the main objective of Russia's 
peacekeeping activity is to protect its national security 
interests through encouraging the establishment and maintenance 
of peace and stability both on the planet as a whole and in 
various regions. 
  In realizing this objective, Russia firmly adheres to the 
generally accepted norms and principles of international law as 
well as the specific norms and rules for carrying out 
peacekeeping activity. The latter category includes: 
  -- matching the form and content of peacekeeping steps to 
the 
situation to be resolved; 
  -- giving priority to political over military ways and means 
of settling a situation; 
  -- strictly observing and protecting human rights; 
  -- using military contingents of peacemaking forces only 
with 
the consent of the opposing sides and with the approval of the 
international community. 
  In the context of the said norms and principles the leading 
areas of the Russian Federation's peacemaking activity are: 
  -- mediating in settling crisis situations and preventing 
the 
escalation of conflicts; 
  -- influencing the conflicting sides by diplomatic means 
above all but also, in extraordinary circumstances, by military 
means with a view to ensuring the fair and peaceful resolution 
of disputed issues; 
  -- taking measures to preserve peace by disengaging the 
conflicting sides by using military contingents of the Russian 
Federation Armed Forces operating under UN auspices or sent into 
the crisis zone with the consent of the conflicting sides within 
the framework of the Collective Security Treaty; 
  -- determining and supporting structures which seek to 
strengthen peace and to prevent the emergence or the 
continuation of a conflict. 
  Thus it is possible to maintain that there is nothing in 
Russia's peacemaking activity or in the tasks entrusted to its 
Armed Forces that runs counter to the fundamental, universally 
recognized norms and principles of international relations. 
  All this confirms once again Russia's desire to be a full 
and 
equal member of the world community in the resolution of 
international peacekeeping questions. 
  The second fundamentally new task for us is to assist 
internal affairs organs and internal troops of the Russian 
Federation Ministry of Internal Affairs in localizing and 
blocking regions of conflict, ending armed clashes, and 
disengaging opposing sides and also to defend strategically 
important installations according to the procedure laid down in 
existing legislation. 
  The possibility of fulfilling such tasks is provided for in 
the legislation of many countries. It is not a question of the 
Armed Forces' assuming any special internal functions but of the 
possibility of additionally involving forces and equipment in 
halting bloodshed. It must be realized here that it is just as 
legitimate to come between, let us say, Ossetians and Ingush who 
have taken up arms as between Serbs and Muslims in Bosnia. 
  What is new is the provision that "the security 
interests of the Russian Federation and other CIS states might 
require the stationing of troops (forces) and means outside the 
territory of the Russian Federation". 
  This provision has elicited a highly ambivalent response 
abroad, particularly in certain "near" countries and in East 
Europe. Such a reaction, however, is, rather, nothing but an 
attempt at political speculation. Because the same paragraph 
unequivocally states that "the conditions for such 
stationing and manning are defined in the appropriate 
international legal documents". In other words, these 
questions are in full accordance with the universally recognized 
norms of international law. 
  The need for military bases outside Russia's territory is 
dictated, above all, by the interests of maintaining stability 
in individual regions. Their deployment is initiated primarily 
by those states that are in need of additional stability factors. 
  As regards military installations, the need for these 
outside 
Russian territory is determined in some cases by their purpose 
(for example, missile attack early warning system radar 
stations) and in other cases by their technical uniqueness and 
by the impossibility of creating a replacement of equal worth on 
Russian territory in the very short term. 
  In all cases military bases and installations are deployed 
outside Russia by mutual agreement between the sides. 
  Here I would like to dwell on the thesis, which is being 
greatly exaggerated by certain people, that Russia is 
supposedly ready to interfere in its neighbors' internal 
affairs. I will cite from the doctrine: "The 
Russian Federation abides by the principles of the peaceful 
settlement of international disputes, respect for a state's 
sovereignty and territorial integrity, noninterference in its 
internal affairs, inviolability of state borders, and other 
universally recognized principles of international law." 
This is set forth in the military doctrine's political 
fundamentals, which take priority over its other constituent 
parts. 
  But the military doctrine's military part proper 
is the basis for the military building of Russia as a whole, the 
elaboration of the concept of building the Armed Forces, the 
strategic planning of their use, and the planning of the use and 
organization of cooperation among other troops in the interests 
of ensuring security. 
  The chief aim in building the Russian Federation Armed 
Forces is to create and develop troops (forces) capable of 
ensuring the defense of the country's independence, sovereignty, 
and territorial integrity, the security of citizens, and other 
vital interests of society and the state in keeping with the 
military-political and strategic situation in the world and with 
the Russian Federation's actual potential. 
  The Basic Provisions record the principles of building the 
Armed Forces. I will venture to draw attention to just a few of 
them: 
  -- organs of military management and officials are under the 
control of the top organs of state power and the Russian 
Federation Council of Ministers-Government; 
  -- general civil political rights and freedoms are observed 
and social protection is provided for servicemen in accordance 
with the specific nature of military service; 
  -- the organizational structure, effective combat strength, 
and numerical strength of troops (forces) correspond to the 
tasks entrusted to them and to the legislation, international 
commitments, and economic potential of the Russian Federation; 
  -- regard is paid to the country's geopolitical and 
geostrategic position; 
  -- Russian and world experience of military building are 
utilized. 
  These basic principles reflect modern conditions and 
determine the thrust of the building of Russia's Armed Forces. 
  The building and development of the Russian Federation Armed 
Forces are conducted in accordance with the concepts of their 
building according to coordinated and concerted programs and 
plans. At the same time the doctrine defines for the Russian 
Federation Armed Forces the following main tasks for the period 
through the year 2000: 
  through 1996: 
  -- the creation of groupings of troops (forces) on the 
territory of the Russian Federation in accordance with their 
purpose and tasks; 
  -- the improvement of the troops' branch structure; 
  -- the completion of the withdrawal of the troops stationed 
outside Russia to its territory; 
  -- the continuation of the switch to a mixed system of 
manning which combines voluntary service -- under contract -- 
with service based on the drafting of citizens for military 
service in accordance with the principle of extraterritoriality 
[voyennaya sluzhba po eksterritorialnomu]; 
  -- the reduction of the Armed Forces' numerical strength to 
the prescribed level. 
  During the period 1996-2000: 
  -- the completion of the reorganization of the Armed Forces' 
structure, the switch to a mixed system of manning, and the 
creation of groupings of troops (forces) and the military 
infrastructure on the Russian Federation's territory. 
  It cannot be ruled out that these tasks and their number and 
timing will be corrected in accordance with the actual 
development of the situation in the country and in the world. 
  The military-technical and economic fundamentals of the 
military doctrine set forth the aims and tasks of 
military-technical support for the Russian Federation's military 
security. They formulate the main areas of development of the 
country's defense industry potential and also of 
military-technical cooperation with foreign countries. 
  The chief aim of military-technical support for the Russian 
Federation's military security is the timely equipping of the 
Armed Forces and other troops of the Russian Federation and 
their material provision with efficient arms systems, military 
and special hardware, and property in quantities necessary and 
sufficient for the guaranteed defense of the vital interests of 
society and the state. 
  At the same time the doctrine defines for the first time 
that 
the needs of the Armed Forces and other troops for armament, 
military hardware, and property will be met with due regard for 
the country's scientific, technical, and economic potential. 
  A few words about military-technical cooperation with 
foreign countries. 
  Whereas military-technical cooperation in the former Soviet 
Union was aimed at supporting welcome regimes and, as is known, 
was more ideological in nature, today Russia regards it as, 
above all, a constituent part of the balanced support for its 
own economic interests. Therefore continued trade in arms and 
military hardware will be one of the elements of activity in 
this sphere. But, at the same time, what is new is the 
emergence in the military doctrine, as one of the basic 
principles of Russia's policy, of the following: "The 
inadmissibility of deliveries of arms and military hardware 
which might exacerbate a crisis situation, undermine regional 
stability, or violate embargoes or other corresponding 
international accords to which the Russian Federation is a 
party." 
  In addition to sales of weapons, it is also planned to 
expand 
contacts with regard to training foreign servicemen, above all 
from CIS countries, in Russian educational institutions. 
  The final section of the "Basic Provisions of Military 
Doctrine" states that the Russian Federation guarantees the 
fulfillment of the provisions of this document. At the same 
time it will strictly abide by the UN Charter and by universally 
recognized international legal norms and principles. 
  This is a brief resume of the crux of the main doctrinal 
provisions aimed at ensuring Russia's security and the defense 
of its vital interests. 
  Like the whole world, Russia is now going through an 
extremely difficult and crucial historical period. It is a 
period of the creation of a new world order. To all 
appearances, its character will predetermine the destiny of 
mankind in all countries and peoples for many decades. It is in 
precisely this world-historical context that the search must be 
made for the role and place of the Russian state in the 
still-evolving and largely contradictory and impermanent 
geopolitical balance of forces and interests.

  [Text] Yerevan, 9 Jun -- Russian Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev, in the Caucasus region on a working visit, has 
described the vote held on [the budget] on Wednesday by the 
Russian State Duma as sad. 
  This budget, in his words, can only guarantee the payment of 
the wages and salaries of military servicemen and civilians 
employed by the military establishment. He expressed hope that 
the Army would get some extrabudgetary funding. If we do not 
get additional extra budgetary funds, then there can be no talk 
of ordering new equipment or arms, Pavel Grachev said. 
  He also said that problems would arise with the funding of 
scientific research and design work. This budget will have a 
negative effect on the future of Russia's armed forces, Pavel 
Grachev said.

  [Text] Moscow, 9 Jun -- Russia's military budget is to be 
revised, Major General Vladimir Osadchiy, a high-ranking 
spokesman of the Russian Defense Ministry, told Itar-Tass today. 
  According to him, the 40.6 trillion rubles allocated for 
military spending by the State Duma represents a threat to the 
national security of the armed forces. "The defense budget will 
not find support in the upper chamber of parliament, and 
discussion of this pressing problem will be continued," Major 
General Vladimir Osadchiy noted. In so doing, he cited public 
remarks made on this issue by Vladimir Shumeyko and the 
statement by Petr Shurshov, chairman of the Federation Council 
security and defense committee, who said the upper chamber would 
not approve a military budget of less than 55 trillion rubles.

  [Text] Mass rallies organized by the association of 
defense workers' unions were held in a number of Russia's cities 
in protest at the destruction of the defense industry. 
  The chairman of the association's central committee, Sergey 
Shuklin, told Interfax that only representatives of the aviation 
industry had failed to take part in the rallies. 
  Shuklin said a number of St. Petersburg enterprises kept 
their sirens on and held shop-floor meetings. Their workers 
also picketed the administrative building. Similar actions were 
also held in Novosibirsk, Barnaul, Kirov, Perm and Moscow. 
  In particular, defense workers demanded their salaries be 
paid, jobs preserved, a mechanism to reconcile mutual debts be 
set up and state control over fuel prices established.

  [Text] At the government's sitting Thursday first Vice 
Premier Oleg Soskovets spoke in favor of gradual restoration of 
Russia's positions on the world arms market. 
  "We have lost too much in this sphere and we must restore 
our 
positions step by step," he underlined. Soskovets reminded that 
in the time of the USSR the Soviet arms export was 30 percent of 
the world one and the share of the United States was 35 percent. 
The situation has radically changed now. As of today, the 
share of the Russian Federation in arms export is five percent 
and the United States controls almost 65 percent of the world 
market. 
  Addressing the sitting of the Cabinet, Soskovets was 
critical 
of several leaders of federal ministries and departments due to 
a low executive discipline and weak control over the situation 
in some concrete branches of industry. In particular, the 
question concerns the Russian Federation committee on Machine- 
Building and Atomic Energy Ministry.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 10 TASS -- Russia is developing new 
regions of the world market of arms. Brazil and Malaysia began 
to import Russian arms. Russia signed agreements with them in 
early June. The Russian military-industrial complex is able to 
restore its prestige of a reliable exporter of arms and military 
equipment, ITAR-TASS was told in the main agency for 
international cooperation of the Russian Defence Ministry. 
  In the 70's-80's, the USSR ranked first in the world for the 
sale of conventional armaments. The peak of the Soviet export 
of arms was reached in 1987 when armaments worth 22.6 billion 
dollars were sold by the USSR. The USSR then accounted for 38 
percent of world trade in arms. 
  According to foreign sources, Russia's share now amounts to 
17 percent. From 1990 Russia reduced arms export to almost 
one-fifth of the volume, yielding the lead to the United States 
which now controls almost 60 percent of the world export of arms. 
  Russia's positions weakened in markets of Eastern Europe it 
once dominated. East European countries now consider purchasing 
NATO armaments. Russia's arms export to Nicaragua, Cuba, Laos 
and Vietnam petered out. Joining United Nations sanction 
banning arms sales to troubled areas, Russia discontinued the 
export of arms to a dozen countries. 
  Russia now sells arms to some 50 countries. According to 
military experts, the Russian military-industrial complex can 
sell up to 30 billion dollars worth of arms a year, earning 
10-12 billion dollars on new armaments. 
  Russia began to sell arms to Brazil from June 3. Under the 
contract, Russia is to deliver to Brazil before the end of the 
year a consignment of antiaircraft missile complexes "Igla" with 
110 ground-to-air missiles. These missiles are regarded in 
Brazil to be the cheapest missiles in the world market of arms. 
They have proved their effectiveness. 
  The possibility of buying other military equipment from 
Russia, including armoured carriers, is considered in Brazil. 
The contract for Brazil's purchases of "Igla" complexes was 
signed in the framework of the trade agreement between Russia 
and Brazil concluded last year. The agreement will be effective 
for four years. The total volume of deals for this period is 
envisaged at two billion dollars. Under the agreement, Brazil 
supplies to Russia coffee, sugar, soybeans in return for Russian 
goods, including arms. 
  With the conclusion on June 7 of a contract to deliver 18 
MiG-29 fighter planes Russia entered armaments market in 
South-East Asia. MiG planes, for which there was a demand abroad 
and Kalashnikov submachine guns accounted for 20 percent of the 
Soviet export of arms. The deal with Malaysia is valued at 
550.5 million dollars. The first plane of the batch will be 
delivered next April. The other planes will be supplied within 
eleven months. There are plans to perfect the plane. 
Refuelling in mid-air will be made possible. The planes will be 
armed with "air-to-air" missiles. The bombing load will be 
increased from two to three tonnes. Russia will help Malaysia 
train pilots. A centre for maintenance of MiG planes will be 
set up. Russia will also help Malaysia develop the airospace, 
defence and other industries. Under the contract, 25 percent of 
the planes' cost will be repaid wilh palm oil products. 
  The Middle East market of arms remains the biggest market 
for 
Russian armaments. Saudi Arabia and the Arab Emirates are 
interested in purchasing new kinds of arms from Russia. Russian 
aircraft, tanks, antiaircraft and antitank complexes, personnel 
carriers and naval ships sell well abroad.

  [Text] Ivan Rybkin, speaker of the State Duma, expressed 
his hope that the upper chamber of the Federal Assembly, the 
Federation Council, will confirm the federal budget for 1994 if 
it receives comprehensive information about the changes 
introduced into its initial version. 
  During his conversation with journalists Thursday he 
reminded 
that while working over the draft the State Duma and the 
government found an internal reserve in the budget totaling 8.5 
trillion rubles. The funds have been primarily channeled to 
support the Army (3.5 trillion rubles) -- for the construction 
of houses for servicemen and for conversion. Rybkin underlined 
that this article is viewed as "a protected one", that is, it 
will not depend upon the level of revenues collection. 
  The amount intended to finance the transfer of social 
facilities from the budget of enterprises to the budget of RF 
[Russian Federation] constituent members has been doubled. 
Rybkin noted that they had found an opportunity to increase 
financial support for science and education. 
  He also reminded that the State Duma passed a decision to 
create a special supra-budget fund into which additional incomes 
from privatization will be forwarded (from July 1 privatization 
will be done with money as opposed to cheques). The government 
foresaw that a total of 1.2 trillion rubles received from 
privatization would be channeled into the budget, meanwhile 
experts of the State Duma Committee on Economic Policy estimate 
that this sum should be no less than 15 trillion rubles. All 
money from this supra-budget fund will be forwarded to build 
houses for servicemen, Rybkin stressed. 
  "If the Federation Council has this information at its 
disposal and if they want to participate in the law-making 
process then the success will be ensured," believes Rybkin. "The 
nation has no more money than there is in the country in 
reality, one should cut one's coat according to one's cloth," 
Rybkin said. 
  He expressed the supposition that "someone wants to destruct 
[as received] the budget in order to spend when and how much he 
wants, including both the currency incomes and foreign economic 
activity." At times, according to his estimate, "somebody 
skillfully exploits the dissatisfaction of the deputies" and 
this is "disgraceful politicizing," he believes. 
  At the same time Ivan Rybkin has no doubts that the State 
Duma will vote for the draft budget in its third reading which 
will probably take place in a week. This will be a formal 
voting, he said, because the third reading implies only 
juridical clarification of the law's wording.

  [Excerpt] Moscow, 9 Jun -- Russian State Duma chairman Ivan 
Rybkin thinks Boris Yeltsin's decrees on economic reform 
appeared because of "the known backwardness of Russian 
legislation." This is what he stated today while opening 
parliamentary hearings on the strengthening of cooperation 
between the federal authorities and local state administrative 
bodies. 
  Ivan Rybkin reported that the important gap in the 
legislation should be overcome as soon as possible and key 
legislative acts needed to be adopted for this to happen, 
including civil and land codes as well as a number of laws on 
legislation. [passage ommitted]

<F P=106> [Petr Karapetyan report: "The Federation Council Will Be </F>
Consistent and It Will Not Let the Figure 37 Slip Through -- 
This Was Declared at a Meeting With Journalists by Federation 
Council Security and Defense Committee Chairman Petr Shirshov"] 
  [Text] With the expenditure level of 37.126 trillion 
rubles [R] stipulated by the draft budget, Shirshov said, the 
systematic process of replacing obsolescent and worn out combat 
and technical resources will, in practice, grind to a halt, 
while training (studies and drill) will be cut. This, in turn, 
will make it impossible to ensure that the combat readiness and 
manageability of the Armed Forces will be maintained at the 
requisite level. The training of someone in handling an assault 
rifle alone, according to Shirshov's calculations, sets the 
state back some R130,000, while that of tank gun operators 
requires some R7 million, and company level tactical exercises 
"cost" R137 million. 
  Apart from anything else, increasing the defense budget to 
R55 trillion will open the way for the budgets of the 33 
Federation components to be topped up significantly. To 
compare: The amounts expounded in the draft Federal budget, the 
committee chairman noted, allow for six or seven federation 
components to "make a living." For instance, one 
military-industrial complex enterprise "supports" a region's 
population 5-10 times bigger than the number of workers at the 
enterprise. Up to 30 percent of the cost of military hardware 
and arms for the Russian Army constitutes expenditure by 
enterprises on the social sphere.

  [Text] The Federation Council, the upper house of the 
Russian parliament, will find it extremely difficult to approve 
the federal 1994 budget as it was passed by the State Duma, the 
lower house, in second reading Wednesday, Budget Committee 
Chairman Nikolay Gonchar told journalists. 
  In particular, he described the increase of the military 
expenses by 3.5 trillion rubles rather than by 18 trillion as 
proposed by the Federation Council as insufficient. This 
decision, he said, will bring the manufacturing industries of 
Russia's 33 regions to their knees. 
  Gonchar was critical of the Duma decision to set up an 
extra-budgetary army support fund where finances obtained from 
privatization would be channeled. He said that if cash were 
available, it had to be included in the budget. 
  He also thought that the financing of regions was 
insufficient. 
  Gonchar thought that the upper house could not confine its 
functions to approval or disapproval of what the Duma decided 
about the budget. He did not rule out the possibility that 
conciliation procedures could be used to have the budget 
endorsed by the upper house.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 110 (600): </F>
Compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; Edited by 
Vladimir Shishlin] 
  [Text] The leader of the team of experts under the 
president Alexander Lifshits believes that the bill on the 
federal budget for 1994 which was approved on Wednesday in the 
second reading reflects the maximum possibilities of the State 
Duma. It is better to have this version of the budget than none 
at all, he said. 
  IF Note: The State Duma approved on June 8 in the second 
reading the bill of a federal budget for 1994 without any 
changes into the past of revenue and of expenditures and its 
deficit. The deputies approved proposals of the budget 
committee of the lower house abut more expenditures for defense 
purposes (from 37.1 trillion to 40.6 trillion rubles) at the 
expense of the internal redistribution of means in the budget. 
The Duma Defense Committee insisted on more money for defense 
purposes (up to 55 trillion rubles). 
  Lifshits stated that the problem was still topical. He 
believes there is a need to search for mechanisms to resolve the 
issue on additional financing of the defense order and other 
needs of the "power" structures. The proposals for the use for 
this purpose of part of the privatization campaign should, 
believes Lifshits, be formed as a concrete legal act. This 
spells serious restrictions for the process of post-voucher 
privatization, he believes. 
  According to the leader of the group of experts, now is the 
time to start thinking on the ideology of the budget for 1995, 
which should be principally different from the present one. 
Lifshits believes that the process should be built from above, 
not from below. First determined should be the principles of 
the structural policies, the concept or the strategy of the 
budget and later it should be considered by the Finance Ministry. 
  Meanwhile, the speaker of the upper house of parliament 
Vladimir Shumeyko criticized the budget approved on Wednesday by 
the State Duma. The Federation Council will not agree to such a 
budget, at least me, said Shumeyko on Thursday speaking with 
journalists in Moscow. 
  He believes the budget has no political orientation. It 
seems that the Duma believes like this: The worse the better. 
The Duma creates grounds for the change of power, said Shumeyko. 
  The current budget indicates that the country has no budget 
policy. He favored the need for greater expenditures for 
defense purposes. 
  In an exclusive interview for Interfax, the Duma speaker 
Rybkin expressed concern over the fact that the upper house of 
parliament, the Federation Council, may not approve the budget. 
He warned that if someone in the Federation Council takes an 
attempt to destroy the budget, he was prepared to make a public 
speech to tell the people of Russia who they were earlier and 
why they destroyed the budget for four years. 
  IF Note: If the upper house does not approve the federal 
budget, it will be returned to the Duma which should collect 
two-thirds of votes for the second approval. If the Duma fails 
to collect the necessary number of votes, the document will have 
to voted again at all levels. According to the chairman of the 
Duma Budget Committee, Mikhail Zadornov, there will be needed 
2-3 weeks for coordination of new budget version. If so, the 
parliament will consider the budget of the 3-4 quarters of the 
year, said Zadornov.

<F P=106> [Yelena Afanasyeva report: "Duma Passes Budget. Who Would </F>
Have Thought It...."] 
  [Text] It would have been hard to call the deputies' mood 
on the eve of the plenary session (it had been planned to devote 
Wednesday and Friday this week entirely to the budget) 
optimistic. For even the mechanical procedure of voting on the 
250 amendments to the budget would take four hours. And then 
only on the basis of a 10-second vote without the slightest 
interruption, discussion, dispute, or break. 
  Many deputies knew from their experience of working in 
previous parliaments that it would not be possible to discuss 
more than 70 amendments in a day. 
  But journalists have noticed a new feature after five months 
of the Duma being at work -- the more vexed a problem is, the 
more unexpectedly and sharply the new parliament cuts through 
these tangles. And this is what happened. 
  After some debate during the closed session Vladimir Isakov 
spontaneously proposed moving straight to a vote to adopt the 
budget on second reading as a whole, bypassing the tedious 
matter of the amendments. This "sharp move" did not get through 
(171 deputies -- 38 percent -- voted for it), but Ivan Rybkin 
managed to tone down the formula to: "passing the budget on 
second reading, taking account of the amendments adopted by the 
Budget Committee, including those on the creation of a special 
nonbudgetary fund for defense needs." 
  The idea behind this interpretation is that the Army will 
immediately receive 3.5 trillion rubles [R] of the R18 trillion 
already ratified from on high by redistributing expenditure 
within the already ratified basic parameters of the budget. The 
Army will get the rest of the money from the special fund, which 
will collect the proceeds from post-voucher privatization, from 
state apparatus spending cuts, and from the abolition of foreign 
trade benefits. How much this income will come to is unknown, 
since nobody knows how much privatization -- the procedure for 
which has not yet been ratified -- will raise, and we all know 
how we usually go about cutting our apparatus. Consequently, 
the sums which the Army may receive for use on social needs are 
unknown, as is the procedure for their distribution. 
  The toned-down formula suited the deputies, all the more so 
as the government, as Deputy Finance Ministry Vladimir Petrov 
put it, has withdrawn its last objection (the demand for R1.5 
trillion to service domestic debt) and has totally supported the 
Budget Committee's amendments. 
  The vote was 228 in favor and 40 against, with 32 
abstentions. And...the budget, unexpectedly for many people, was 
adopted. The coordination of the faction leaders' positions 
bore fruit. Whereas such different people as Rybkin, Burbulis, 
and Nevzorov voted in favor, "Yabloko" mostly did not vote. The 
Zhirinovskiy faction was almost entirely absent -- accompanying 
their leader in Krasnodar Kray. 
  The budget has been passed by the Duma. But this does not 
mean that Russia now has a budget for this year. The budget now 
has to be ratified by the Federation Council, which is 
categorically insisting on allocating the entire requested sum 
of R55 trillion to the Army and is demanding R23 trillion on its 
own behalf for Federation components. The upper house's 
disapproval of the lower house will have to be overcome by a 
two-thirds vote -- which, given the "marginal" [pogranichnyy] 
vote yesterday (51 percent in favor) will be very problematic. 
  Later the budget (after passing the Duma and the Federation 
Council) will reach the president. And he, if you recall, has 
already stated that he will not allow himself to fall out with 
the Army. 
  Here is a riddle -- in what month of what year will Russia 
finally get the ratified 1994 budget? 
  P.S. It transpired at the end of the day that the Duma will 
have to vote once again on the draft budget. This time -- 
according to the procedure approved by it for the adoption of 
the federal budget -- "as a whole."

  [Text] Moscow June 10 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin will submit 17 most important bills to the State Duma 
(lower chamber of the Russian Parliament) in June. They are 
intended to help implement the social concord agreement. Their 
list was today handed out to Duma members. 
  The package includes bills "On the Government of the Russian 
Federation", "On Combatting Organised Crime", "The Criminal Code 
of the Russian Federation", "On General Principles of State 
Power in the Russian Federation", "On Federal Executive Bodies", 
and also on the flag and coat-of-arms of the Russian Federation. 
  The bill on the "Criminal-Procedural Code of the Russian 
Federation" will be the last to be submitted to the State Duma 
-- on June 30. The first ones to be discussed will be two 
bills: "On the Procedure for Adopting and Putting Into Force the 
Federal Constitutional Laws and Federal Laws" and "On Amendments 
to the Law on the State Border". The documents also include a 
bill "On the Right to Information". 
  Yeltsin has instructed his plenipotentiary representative in 
the Federal Assembly to agree with the State Duma and the 
government on their joint work to finalise the bills, which the 
lower chamber of the parliament is to discuss. He also 
instructed the head of the presidential administration to 
appoint the people who will be personally responsible for 
drawing up the bills in conformity with the fixed plan.

  [Text] Sergey Baburin, MP, a leader of the Russian 
All-People's League, officially left the opposition movement 
Concord for Russia. 
  Vasiliy Lipitskiy, chairman of the Social-Democratic Popular 
Party of Russia, told journalists that Baburin had made his move 
following the State Duma's vote Wednesday on the 1994 budget. 
Communist Party and Agrarian Party leaders Gennadiy Zyuganov and 
Mikhail Lapshin voted for the budget draft while Baburin 
rejected it. 
  Baburin jointly with former Russian vice-president Aleksandr 
Rutskoy, Zyuganov, Lapshin, Constitutional Court Justice Valeriy 
Zorkin and the Duma's Economic Policy Committee Chairman Sergey 
Glazyev founded the Concord for Russia opposition movement and 
attended last May's session of the movement's National Council. 
  A week later he said in Novosibirsk, however, that the 
Russian All-People's League would not support Rutskoy, who could 
become the opposition candidate in the coming presidential 
elections.

"Council on Entrepreneurship Being Set Up Under Duma. Two 
Similar Councils Already Exist Under the Government"] 
  [Text] The leaders of the "Russian Business Roundtable" 
[RBR] association of entrepreneurial unions and movements are 
pressing on with the campaign to create systems for interaction 
of business circles with power structures. RBR Chairman Ivan 
Kivelidi met the other day with Speaker Ivan Rybkin. The 
discussion was devoted to questions of cooperation between 
parliament and entrepreneurial circles. 
  Mr. Kivelidi and Mr. Rybkin agreed on the need to form a 
special independent organ that would coordinate the RBR's 
relations with the Federal Assembly on the one hand, and with 
the government on the other. Also, the need to hold 
consultations between Duma committees and RBR representatives on 
all matters pertaining to entrepreneurial activities was 
recognized. 
  At the same time the "Roundtable" made a statement voicing 
bewilderment at the fact that "there exist in the structure of 
the government two parallel councils on entrepreneurial matters 
-- a Council on Industrial Policy and Entrepreneurship, and a 
Council on the Development of Entrepreneurship." The statement 
points out that "the making of an artificial distinction between 
managers and businessmen of Russia may entail consequences that 
could hold up the natural development of the economy." The RBR 
proposes to the government to create a unified "State Council on 
Entrepreneurship" whose members must be confirmed with the 
opinions of public associations of entrepreneurs being taken 
into account.

<F P=106> [Vasiliy Ustyuzhanin report: "Where Is Our Share?"] </F>
  [text] The State Duma yesterday supported an appeal from 
chief editors of papers and magazines published by the "Pressa" 
publishing house. What do journalists of KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, 
SELSKAYA ZHIZN, OGONEK, KRESTYANKA, PRAVDA, ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA 
-- around 20 publications in all -- want? In short -- justice. 
  The publishing house had been expanding for many years, 
including on the money of newspapers and magazines. Through 
collective efforts a unique publishing complex was created. But 
following the well-known August events the publishing house 
received state-owned status, while the newspapers got the status 
of juridical entities and...no shares in the property. As a 
result, every editorial collective was forced to conclude a 
lease contract separately with the publishing house on -- let us 
be blunt -- disadvantageous terms. 
  State Duma deputies deemed the demands of the journalists' 
collectives to be well-founded, and proposed that the government 
adopt the necessary measures.

  [Text] Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov has called on the 
president, government and parliament to take immediate measures 
to fight crime. He supported the need to grant the police, 
prosecutor's offices and the Federal Counterintelligence Service 
extra powers which would enable them to impose order both in the 
capital and provinces of Russia as soon as possible. 
  If this does not happen in the near future, Moscow as a 
subject of the Russian Federation will have to make an 
independent decision, according to Luzhkov's statement published 
Thursday. 
  In Luzhkov's opinion, the main reason impeding the ultimate 
resolution of the issue is entirely obsolete legislation. 
  "Today laws protect criminals and tie the hands of the 
law-enforcement bodies," the statement runs. 
  In particular, Luzhkov expressed concern over the attempt 
upon the chairman of board of the joint-stock company LogoVAZ, 
Boris Berezovsky, on June 7 and other terrorist acts in Moscow 
this week which lead to the loss of life. 
  Luzhkov said he had instructed the law-enforcement bodies to 
use the tightest and harshest measures while investigating these 
crimes. "The chaos on the streets of our city must be stopped," 
Luzhkov stressed.

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Leskov: "Amplification of Stories About </F>
Those Responsible for Explosion at `LogoVAZ' Office"] 
  [Text] As everyone saw on "Ostankino," Boris Berezovskiy, 
chairman of the "LogoVAZ" Board of Directors and general 
director of the All-Russia Automobile Alliance, was wounded on 
the evening of 7 June at the "LogoVAZ" company's reception 
center as the result of a massive explosion. An explosive 
device planted in an unoccupied car parked by the side of the 
road detonated the moment the Mercedes-600 containing 
Berezovskiy emerged though the gates of the reception center. 
The driver of the Mercedes was killed on the spot by fragments 
of the device, while Berezovskiy and his bodyguard, as well as 
several passersby, were injured. 
  Late in the evening Berezovskiy, who received severe burns 
to 
the face and hands, was sent home from the hospital but is under 
the constant observation of a doctor. The bodyguard is in a 
very serious condition: He has lost his sight, and the lower 
part of his face has been badly affected. It was only at midday 
on 8 June that it became clear that his condition had, as the 
doctors put it, "stabilized." 
  An official statement put out by the "LogoVAZ" board 
describes the incident as a terrorist act aimed at killing 
Berezovskiy. The version of events which maintains that this 
was a chance occurrence, an attempt on the life of the owner of 
the car containing the bomb, is being refuted. The grounds for 
this are as follows. The explosive device was directional and 
the mechanism itself was filled with many metal balls and 
splinters which were spread over a distance of 150-200 meters. 
  It is most likely that the owner of the car which was blown 
up, who was allegedly in the neighboring casino, does not exist. 
Several witnesses claim that the car, which was completely 
destroyed by the blast, had Lithuanian license plates. 
  The interpretation that it was linked to the allocation of 
spheres of interest is denied in just as categorical a manner. 
Indeed, "LogoVAZ" does not have any competitors in Russia in 
terms of volumes of sales. However, last year a series of 
explosions shook "LogoVAZ" parking lots in Moscow which the 
company itself tried to investigate. As we were told in private 
conversations, they succeeded in ascertaining who the terrorist 
was. He turned out to be a half-crazy lone blackmailer 
unconnected to any criminal groupings. Following the recent 
incident, doubts about this verdict have only intensified. 
  At the same time, people at "LogoVAZ" maintain that neither 
Berezovskiy nor "LogoVAZ" have recently been the victims of 
intimidation. Unofficial sources assert that, considering the 
realities of life in this country, the company could long ago 
have reached a peace agreement with the capital's major mafia 
structures. However, it is not really possible to monitor all 
groups making money out of automobiles. 
  One interpretation of the attempt on Berezovskiy's life says 
that recently this entrepreneur has significantly broadened his 
range of activities and begun to pay greater attention to 
politics. Berezovskiy, 47, is a corresponding member of the 
Russian Academy of Sciences and the author of many scientific 
works on the theory of management. It was he who was the 
inspiration behind the first private industrial investment 
project in Russia, "AVVA," to build a new giant automobile plant 
in Tolyatti. That aside, Berezovskiy is the founder of 
Russia's largest charitable foundation -- "Triumf."

  [Text] It is very likely that on 21 June St. Petersburg 
will be left without water and light. On that date the 
Lentransgaz Association will halt gas deliveries to all the 
city's power stations. The reason is the usual one--debts. 
This year the Lentransgaz joint-stock company has not received 
60 billion rubles. With sums like that, the system of mutual 
accounts is no longer working, the Lenpromgaz [as heard] chief 
engineer said today in an interview to the Sankt-Peterburgskiye 
Vedemosti Agency. A cardinal solution has to be found. Simply 
patching up the budget will just lead to the water and light 
problem returning closer to winter.

  [Text] The pressure on Chechnya by Russia can seriously 
aggravate the situation in the North Caucasus and result in 
widescale armed clashes, believes Chechen President Dzhokhar 
Dudayev. "The policy pursued by Russia has absolutely no 
prospects and can lead to a global military confrontation 
between Russia and the Caucasus which can finally develop into a 
new Russian-Caucasian war," Dudayev declared in his interview 
with Interfax. 
  As Dudayev asserts, young people from other North Caucasian 
republic who are concerned over the worsening situation around 
Chechnya are coming to Groznyy. In Dudayev's words, they 
express their wish to serve in the armed forces of the Chechen 
republic. 
  Being interviewed by Interfax the day before, Sergey 
Filatov, 
head of the president's administration, accused Dudayev, who has 
repeatedly voiced sharp anti-Russian statements, of actual 
disruption of the negotiating process between Moscow and 
Groznyy. Having recognized that Dudayev possesses the real power 
in Chechnya, Filatov expressed his hope that the Russian-Chechen 
dialogue would be resumed in the near term.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Mashtakov under the general heading "Who </F>
Is Kicking the Chair From Under President Dudayev?": "The View 
From Moscow"] 
  [Text] It would appear that the situation in Chechnya is 
beginning to acquire the hallmarks of a farce. The local 
authorities' decision on Sunday to deprive Ruslan Khasbulatov, 
the former speaker of the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet; 
Doku Zavgayev, the last head of the Checheno-Ingushetia party 
apparatus; and Yaraga Mamadayev, who heads the 
"government-in-exile of the people's trust"; of the right to 
reside on the republic's territory, is "an exclusively defensive 
action." This colorful company is united, in the opinion of the 
Chechen Republic's law-enforcement organs, by "activity against 
the Chechen people and a pact with the Russian imperial 
authorities." In practice this expressed itself, according to 
the same sources, in elaborating "plans to dismantle the 
independent Chechen state" with the Russian Government. 
  Meanwhile, Moscow's official refusal to sit down at the 
negotiating table with the Chechen delegation, delivered last 
Tuesday by Sergey Filatov, will evidently make the Groznyy 
leadership still more nervous and suspect Russia even more of 
hatching "occupation plans." In Yaraga Mamadayev's words, it 
cannot be ruled out that Dudayev's administration could stage an 
armed provocation on the Russian-Chechen border in order to whip 
up internal political tension in Chechnya and torpedo the 
elections to the federal parliament. 
  At the same time, according to Sergey Shakhray, despite the 
deterioration of relations between Groznyy and Moscow, the 
Russian Government is holding consultations with interested 
representatives of Chechnya in order to resolve a whole range of 
problems between Russia and this North Caucasus republic. 
Although the Russian vice premier does not clarify with whom 
these consultations are being held, there is every reason to 
suggest that it is the same "persona non grata" deported from 
Chechnya by President Dudayev last week. 
  Of course, the right to play the first violin for the 
Chechen 
side in the consultations by no means belongs to Ruslan 
Khasbulatov -- after the events of last October it would be 
naive to think otherwise. Yaraga Mamadayev, who today is well 
in with Sergey Filatov and Viktor Yerin, has more considerable 
chances of reaching agreement with the Russian authorities. 
However, the black spots in Mamadayev's biography -- for 
example, the support for his political activity from Chechen 
commercial structures -- and his personal friendship with Ruslan 
Khasbulatov -- cause the federal authorities to treat this 
figure cautiously as well. 
  Strange as it may seem, the Kremlin believes the most 
probable candidate for the post of the next leader of Chechnya 
to be Doku Zavgayev, who currently works in Boris Yeltsin's 
staff. Despite his defeat in September 1991 (following the 
August events he was forced to resign his post as chairman of 
the Checheno-Ingushetia Supreme Soviet), Zavgayev is today 
effectively the only Chechen politician who appeals both to 
Moscow and his own compatriots. 
  No one, it would appear, knows today how the Chechen card 
will be played. One thing only is known: In the next stage of 
the historical cycle the farce will inevitably slide into a 
tragedy. Whether it can be avoided is another question.

<F P=106> [Video report by A. Abonosimova from Vladivostok; from the </F>
"Vesti" newscast] 
  [Text] The administration in Maritime Kray considers it 
necessary to introduce direct presidential rule on the region's 
territory. Asking for privileged economic conditions in 
taxation, customs duties, subsidies, and compensation for two to 
three years, the governor Ye. Nazdratenko believes that it is 
necessary to introduce a state of emergency on the territory of 
the Maritime region in order to fight gangsterism and crime. 
Discipline and a tough executive authority are needed. 
  Insofar as the kray's economy and management cannot be 
separated, the head of administration believes that it would be 
very appropriate for the kray to switch to direct state rule, at 
the same time as a resolution on the special economic situation 
of the kray is signed in September after the arrival here of 
Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin. A system for the compulsary 
implementation of presidential decrees has been drafted. He had 
the following to say about this. 
  [Nazdratenko] The government should take action on all of 
these matters. Maybe even, in many cases, without the agreement 
of parliament because of the inefficiency of the enterprises on 
the territory of our country. 
  [Abonosimova] Sure of the support of the president and the 
tendency of parliament to put a brake on matters, Nazdratenko, 
asked who would make the decision to introduce emergency rule, 
said: 
  [Nazdratenko] The Federation Council, of course -- that 
would 
be the ideal choice.

<F P=106> [Valeriya Ochinyan report: "Changes in Sverdlovsk Oblast </F>
Administration. Sverdlovsk Governor Gets Rid of `Old Guard'"] 
  [Text] It has taken Sverdlovsk Oblast Governor Aleksey 
Strakhov five months to finally decide on a reshuffle in the 
administration. He announced the move in yesterday's sitting of 
the oblast government. Despite the many expectations, however, 
the fired officials were not the men of former governor Eduard 
Rossel, but rather members of the "old guard" who used to work 
in Sverdlovsk with Boris Yeltsin and Oleg Lobov. 
  The shakeout, the possibility of which Aleksey Strakhov 
warned about back in his first days as governor, has affected 
the positions of importance for the oblast: Having been 
relieved of their positions are Aleksandr Nebesnov, deputy 
administration head for transport and communications; Sergey 
Turunovskiy, administrator of affairs; Anatoliy Tarasov, head of 
the foreign economic relations administration; and Galina 
Ivanina, head of the organizational department. Incidentally, 
Mrs. Ivanina is the only "casualty" whose dismissal was 
explained by the administration's head himself; he accused her 
of "working for the Duma." The cause of Mr. Tarasov's dismissal 
is also clear, however, for he is being identified with the 
abuses by the oblast's special exporters of strategic raw 
materials who were recently exposed by a commission of the 
Control Administration under the president. 
  According to informed sources, so protracted a hiatus 
between 
Mr. Strakhov's appointment as governor and the start of the 
personnel "purges" is attributed to the difficulties of 
selecting personnel to fill key positions in the oblast. One 
can still suppose that the governor will not draw the line at 
parting with the mentioned officials, and the administration is 
in for new waves of dismissals. At the same time, observers 
think, the fired officials cannot be identified at all as 
"Rossel's people" because most of them had been working in the 
oblast [Communist Party] executive committee ever since Boris 
Yeltsin was secretary of the oblast committee, and Oleg Lobov 
chairman of the oblast executive committee. Experts who predict 
Mr. Rossel's comeback as governor think Strakhov's reshuffle 
would stand any of his successors in good stead because 
discernible behind the current change is the desire to replace 
the old-style administrators with younger ones, capable of 
flexible methods of work.

  [Text] Komsomolsk on Amur June 9 TASS -- The primary 
organisation of the Russian National Unity Movement formed in 
Komsomolsk on Amur distributes newspapers and leaflets. The 
organisation is in opposition to both democrats and communists. 
On matters of national policy it holds an even tougher stand 
than the Zhirinovskiy party. The movement's credo is "revival 
of the Russian nation". 
  Members of the local organisation of the Russian National 
Unity Movement strive to enlist support among workers, the 
military and youth. The movement has supporters among Cossacks 
and the local patriotic society RUS. The organisation's leaders 
have contacts with Moscow and receive from Moscow newspapers and 
booklets, specifically "The Russian Order", "Russian World", 
"Our Fatherland". These publications are blatantly 
nationalistic. The authorities of Komsomolsk on Amur try not to 
notice the new organisation that has not been registered 
officially.

  [Text] The edict issued by Mikhail Nikolayev, president of 
the Sakha Republic, Yakutia, establishes special rules for entry 
into the republic. They concern citizens of foreign states and 
CIS countries, as well as those republics of the Russian 
Federation which have not signed the federal agreement. To 
enter Yakutia from now on, it is necessary for them to have 
special invitations approved by the local authorities. In a 
number of instances, citizens in given categories could be 
refused permission to enter the republic of Sakha, or be 
expelled before the expiration of their stay. The grounds for 
this specifically are actions which go against the interests of 
state security or public order, established traditions and 
standards of moral behavior, as well as breaches of customs, 
currency, and other laws of the Russian Federation and Yakutia.

South Korea will face a calamity if a war breaks out because

  Kim Yong-nam said North Korea has the will and sufficient 
capability to defend itself from sanctions. Kim Yong-nam also 
stressed that North Korea will continue to pursue missile 
launching tests.

  [Text] Kiev [no date as received] -- An agreement setting 
up a joint Ukrainian-Korean commission for trade and economic 
cooperation was signed on 8 June at the Ministry of Foreign 
Economic Relations. It was signed by Petro Kaban, deputy 
minister of foreign economic relations for the Ukrainian side, 
and Han Su-kil, deputy chairman of the Commission for External 
Economic Affairs of the DPRK. 
  Kaban said the agreement would promote trade and economic 
cooperation between the two countries on the same scale as when 
Ukraine was in the Soviet Union. Deputy Minister of Industry 
Hryhoriy Osaulenko has been nominated to head the Ukrainian 
staff at the commission who are to be approved by the Cabinet of 
Ministers. 
  Han Su-kil said that the DPRK was mainly interested in 
importing equipment from Ukraine for its mines, generators, and 
rolled metal plates, and in Ukraine's assistance in the 
development of oil fields and oil extraction. 
  Anatoliy Kolos, Ukraine's deputy minister of foreign 
economic 
relations said Ukraine had already set up such joint commissions 
with Poland, Hungary, Vietnam, Mongolia, China, and other 
countries. An agreement with the DPRK pointed to renewal of 
Ukraine-North Korean economic relations. Kolos added that 
Ukraine had the resources to develop oil fields in the DPRK. 
Negotiations at this stage concern the method of payment for 
Ukrainian services, whether it will be made in hard currency or 
on terms of barter supplies. 
  The joint Ukrainian-Korean commission for trade and economic 
cooperation is provisionally planning to hold its first meeting 
in September in Pyongyang.

  [Text] Today, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk received 
Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] The Vietnamese prime minister 
is 
in Kiev on an official three-day visit. 
  At the start of their conversation, the Ukrainian president

talks with Ukraine's senior government officials and economists, 
held by the Vietnamese guest in the last two days. 
  Several important documents and agreements on wider-ranging 
cooperation between Ukraine and Vietnam were signed. The latter

out the reconstruction of Vietnamese power engineering 
enterprises, and even today there are some Ukrainian specialists 
taking part in the construction of two hydroelectric stations in 
the south and north of that country. Machine building, the 
chemical and light industries are just some of the aspects of 
our mutual interest in cooperation.

  [Text] Kiev [No date as received] -- A meeting of Ukrainian 
and Vietnamese business representatives was held yesterday at 
Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, during an 
official visit by a delegation of the Socialist Republic of 
Vietnam led by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. 
  Anatoliy Kolos, Ukraine's deputy minister of foreign 
economic 
relations, said the Ukrainian-Vietnamese trade turnover in 1993 
was $39 million, including $23 million in exports and $7 million 
in imports. Ukraine's exports to Vietnam include hydroturbines, 
bulldozers, transport lifting equipment, and others. Import 
priorities are rice and rubber. According to Anatoliy Kolos, 29 
joint Ukrainian-Vietnamese ventures have been set up in the 
years of independence, eight of which are manufacturers. 
  Mai Van Zakh [name as received], Vietnam's deputy minister 
of 
commerce, said that thanks to reforms introduced in Vietnam in 
1986, the country's exports have been boosted by 20 percent each 
year. One of Vietnam's priorities in foreign relations, the 
deputy minister said, is renewal of ties with CIS states, 
particularly, with Ukraine. Mai Van Zakh told UNIAN that the 
slow development of Ukrainian-Vietnamese relations was caused by 
Ukraine's lack of legislative regulations on payments. 
  Deputy Minister Anatoliy Kolos said in an interview that 
Ukraine is mainly interested in Vietnamese rubber imports for 
which Ukraine could supply relevant processing equipment. In 
order to resolve the other bilateral issues, Ukraine and Vietnam 
set up an intergovernmental commission led by Vietnam's deputy 
minister of commerce and Ukraine's deputy minister of foreign 
economic relations, Anatoliy Kolos. The commission will look at 
the possibility of setting up a Ukrainian-Vietnamese bank. 
  Summing up the meeting, Anatoliy Kolos pointed out favorable 
trends in the development of Ukrainian-Vietnamese relations, 
saying that despite all economic obstacles, Ukraine's exports to 
Vietnam have grown 10-fold in the first quarter of this year, 
while imports have increased two-fold, compared with the 
respective period last year.

  The former USSR countries and the East European states -- 
Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary -- should 
unite economically with the aim of protecting their markets. 
Ukraine's Deputy Premier Valentyn Landyk said this in an 
interview for the mass media. He pointed out that the West 
European markets are not waiting for Ukrainian products, but at 
the same time everything possible is being done by Western firms 
to conquer the CIS markets. In the opinion of Valentyn Landyk, 
Ukraine's export potential today is not as high as one would 
like it to be -- mainly raw materials are offered for export. 
Our state can sell its industrial products to Russia and other 
Commonwealth countries. 
  The Ukrainian deputy prime minister emphasized that our 
state's accession to the CIS Economic Union with the rights of 
an associate member is an important move. An associate member 
is even in a better situation as it has more freedom and elbow 
room, underlined Valentyn Landyk.

<F P=106> [Report by Viktor Drozd from Kiev: "Who Is Last in Line for </F>
Spies?"] 
  [Text] Last year PRAVDA reported on the enhanced interest 
by foreign special services in secret installations located in 
Dnepropetrovskaya Oblast. It seems, however, that an appetite 
for secrets comes in the eating. Now, according to KIEVSKIYE 
VEDOMOSTI, (citing an interview with V. Nazarenko, deputy chief 
of the Ukraine Security Service Division in Zaporozhskaya 
Oblast), foreign knights of the cloak and dagger are not content 
with the "enhanced interest in secrets concentrated in the 
region." 
  Recently the Ukraine Security Service caught red-handed 
several residents of Zaporozhskaya Oblast who in exchange for 
"greenbacks" transferred valuable information abroad. Without a 
second's hesitation, special services are openly encouraging 
"cooperation" not only among the recruited Ukrainian citizens 
but also their relatives and friends. True, special services 
display initiative in all directions. The FBI, in particular, 
via the RUSSKOYE SLOVO newspaper, has called on the 
"Russian-speaking public of the United States and the newly 
arriving emigrants" to help their new country.... "Throughout 
many years," the FBI recalls, "emigrants from the USSR have 
rendered assistance to the FBI.... We request those who possess 
any information to come to the local FBI office."

  [Text] Kiev, [no dateline as received] -- Another round of 
interstate negotiations between Ukraine and Russia on the issue 
of Black Sea Fleet division is concluding on 9 June. On the 
second day of the meeting, the sides commenced discussion on the 
division of the Black Sea Fleet's shore infrastructure. The 
sides decided on the division of combat ships, boats, 
special-purpose vessels, and auxiliary craft specifically, 
"according to the pennants principle" [za vympelamy]. 
  Interviewed by a UNIAN correspondent, Ukrainian navy 
commander Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy has explained that the ship 
repair works, bases, armament depots, etc., in particular, 
belong to the shore infrastructure. In the vice admiral's 
words, "every type of missile armaments for Black Sea Fleet 
ships, not to mention artillery; mines; torpedoes; 
anti-submarine armaments; hydrographic, navigational, and radio 
equipment; and chemical weapons," requires a separate 
maintenance facility." According to Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy, up 
to 30 Black Sea Fleet facilities are quite unique. The vice 
admiral's opinion is that "neither side can do without them, and 
they should only be used jointly." 
  Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy says some of the Russian 
delegation's 
members are attempting to reduce the issue of separating the 
Russian and Ukrainian navies to a merely geographic 
interpretation of the problem. He says: "It indeed is possible 
for the moorings of separate ships to be arranged in different 
harbors. The separation of the forces, however, has to take 
account of jointly using a whole number of Black Sea Fleet 
facilities, regardless of who owns or rents them." 
  Talking to journalists, Russian Ambassador Yuriy Dubinin, 
the 
head of the Russian delegation, has said he hoped the division 
of the fleet might be over by the autumn. He emphasized that 
the talks were to conclude by signing one document with 
appendices, rather than separate ones on the ships and the 
infrastructure. "The result of this will be that the Black Sea 
Fleet will acquire a new quality without suffering the loss of 
those needed by it." He believes that the problem of Black Sea 
Fleet division is mainly psychological. 
  Yuriy Dubinin confirmed that he understood the notion of 
"separating the fleets" as having the main bases of the Russian 
Navy and those of the Ukrainian Navy at a certain distance from 
each other. 
  The head of the Russian delegation said he would offer the 
Ukrainian side to continue working on documents relating to 
fleet division in Moscow.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F>
Mikhail Melnik] 
  [Text] Kiev 9 June TASS -- The division of the Black Sea 
Fleet must bring tranquility to people and confidence of the 
morrow. It is important to ensure that there should be no 
conflicts nor incidents in this process so that the personnel 
should calmly conduct their service and that there should be no 
animosity and misunderstanding between the two fraternal 
peoples, Yuriy Dubinin, ambassador at large of the Russian 
Foreign Ministry, who heads the Russian delegation at the talks 
in Kiev, said in an exclusive interview to ITAR-TASS on Thursday. 
  Dubinin believes the negotiating on Wednesday was "extremely 
useful and constructive." So far there have been disputes on 
general principles, without addressing the essence of the 
matter. Now the sides have been able to pass on from generalised 
declarations to specific debating on the specific list of naval 
ships and other vehicles, as well as places of basing of the 
Black Sea Fleet and the Ukrainian Navy, Dubinin said. The main 
parameters of the division of ships have been in general 
defined, the head of the Russian delegation said. Economists 
and financial experts work alongside military experts to assess 
the cost of ships and infrastructure of the Navy. They will 
make their conclusions known to the delegations. 
  Dubinin believes that all the matters involved in the 
division of the Black Sea Fleet should be formulated in one 
document, an agreement, that would set out provisions for the 
settlement of every stage of the division. 
  "We want the Ukrainian naval forces to rally as soon as 
possible and Russia's Black Sea Fleet to embark on a new stage 
of its development without losing its characteristic combat 
properties," Dubinin said. 
  The negotiations go on. Unless this work is concluded in 
Kiev, the next round will be held in Moscow.

  [Text] The problem of division of the Black Sea Fleet 
warships and launches, which is discussed by the Russian and 
Ukrainian delegations in Kiev, has been nearly solved. The 
statement was made Thursday [9 June] before the beginning of the 
next round of talks by commander of the Ukrainian Navy, Vladimir 
Bezkorovainy. 
  Speaking about the problem of basing, Bezkorovainy said that 
the Ukrainian Navy could also use the bases leased to the 
Russian Navy. 
  The head of the Russian delegation at the talks, Yuri 
Dubinin 
marked the constructive and friendly situation at the talks. 
  He said that according to the understanding Ukraine should 
have 18.3 pct of Black Sea Fleet's warships. 
  Dubinin said if the sides fail to achieve a definite result 
on Thursday, we shall invite the Ukrainian delegation to Moscow 
to continue talks. 
  Russian Ambassador in Kiev Leonid Smolyakov told 
INTERFAX-Ukraine that still unresolved are the conditions and 
deployment period of the Russian Navy in the Ukrainian territory.

  [Text] Kiev, [no dateline as received] -- A regular two-day 
round of negotiations between Russian and Ukraine on issues of 
dividing the Black Sea Fleet ended 9 June. The sides were led 
by Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov and Yuriy 
Dubinin, Russia's ambassador-at-large. 
  According to Shamrov, the current round was marked by a 
desire to find a compromise decision to solve the Black Sea 
Fleet issue. "After an agreement in principle was reached on 
dividing the fleets, specific lists of ships and vessels as well 
as the infrastructure subject to division were determined, and 
also a basis was laid down for a document which outlines the 
status of the base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet," Shmarov said. 
  In the opinion of one of the members of the Ukrainian 
delegation "the progress at the negotiations was slow and one 
might expect them to become more lively after the 26 June 
presidential elections." 
  As presidential representative in Sevastopol Mykola Hlushko 
said in an interview with UNIAN, uncertainty, as far as the 
location of the Black Sea Fleet main base is concerned, hampers 
the division of the coastal infrastructure. According to him, 
the Russian side insisted that Sevastopol be selected as the 
main base. The local authorities, remarked Hlushko, were more 
inclined to agree with the proposal of the Ukrainian side: to 
determine that the Black Sea Fleet main base should be not 
Sevastopol as a whole, but that the base should be in the city 
of Sevastopol, i.e. on its territory. 
  Hlushko emphasized that today only Ukraine renders financial 
aid to Sevastopol: [word indistinct] to the value of 50 billion 
karbovantsi were allocated by the government to maintain the 
city, 33 billion karbovantsi of target aid were extended on a 
nonrepayment basis to finish the construction of purification 
systems at the Mezhgornyy water reservoir. On 8 June Sevastopol 
received target credits to the value of 50 billion karbovantsi 
(at the interest rate of 123 percent for a term of 40 days) to 
purchase foods products. 
  Replying to a question from the UNIAN correspondent on 
whether the city authorities would change their stand after the 
26 June elections, Hlushko expressed his conviction that the 
development of relations between Sevastopol and Kiev along other 
ways is unrealistic. 
  The president's representative in Sevastopol mentioned the 
sum Russia would have to pay for the possible rent of the land 
and the immovable property of the Black Sea Fleet--2.5 trillion 
[as received] karbovantsi per annum. This money would be 
channelled to the city budget exclusively. Hlushko believes 
that a separate agreement between the governments of Ukraine, 
Russia, and Crimea with the participation of Sevastopol should 
stipulate the annual sum to be paid by Russia for the 
development of the city's infrastructure. 
  In an exclusive interview with UNIAN, the Ukrainian Naval 
Forces commander, Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy, pointed out that at 
the next round of negotiations attention would be paid to the 
infrastructure only, because "the issue on the division of ships 
and vessels has been solved." The vice admiral also emphasized 
the importance of noninterference on the part of the destructive 
forces at present, so that the "work done by the delegations 
would not be accelerated artificially by rallies and provocative 
statements." 
  Answering a question from UNIAN, the head of the Russian 
delegation said that the sides are working on an agreement, 
which could be signed at the top level (presumably, at the level 
of prime ministers). 
  In the near future the negotiations will be continued by the 
delegations in their present composition, possibly in Moscow, 
although the Ukrainian side insists that they should be held 
beyond the borders of Russia and Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Report by Ustin Gritsenko: "Black Sea Fleet Talks: Leonid </F>
Kravchuk Retreats But Does Not Give Up"] 
  [Text] It has become possible in the course of the ongoing 
"Black Sea Fleet division" talks to produce a draft agreement 
under which Russian ships would after all be deployed in 
Sevastopol. Kiev, according to Russian Ambassador to Ukraine 
Leonid Smolyakov, agrees to this in principle. But Leonid 
Kravchuk, forced to make concessions that do not add luster to 
his image as a "patriot," put forward a new slogan in the course 
of his Zhitomir tour. In his words, "instead of nuclear 
missiles Ukraine intends to have high- precision arms." 
  The latest round of Black Sea Fleet talks discussed the 
division of not only the bases but also the shore-based 
infrastructure. By the start of the discussions that moved from 
Sevastopol to Kiev, the experts did a certain amount of work: 
according to Admiral Feliks Gromov, commander in chief of the 
Russian Navy, the parameters in accordance with which the 
division of ships will take place "have been basically 
determined" already by both the experts and the economists. 
Members of the delegations were briefed on the results of this 
work. Some, of course, had more ideas "up their sleeve," 
hearing which Adm. Gromov thinks "different points of view on 
separate questions cannot be ruled out." Agreement on 
Sevastopol, though, was on the whole sewn up. In the program of 
further talks is the division of the remaining naval bases along 
the Crimean coast. 
  Considering perhaps that the talks on the Black Sea Fleet 
would hardly be over by 26 June (election date), Kravchuk 
avoided serious statements about dividing the fleet. But on the 
other hand, he told the officers and cadets of the Zhitomir Air 
Defense Radio Electronics Higher Military School about new 
prospects of boosting the republic's military might. He pointed 
out that in Ukraine (as also "both in Russia, and in the United 
States") "scientific exploration" is under way to develop some 
sort of "high-precision weapon with assigned parameters." 
Leonid Makarovich [Kravchuk] did not go into details, hinting 
vaguely that this weapon "is capable of engaging installations 
that carry danger, and of protecting from weapons of mass 
destruction, nuclear weapons included." It is this secret 
weapon that Ukraine intends to add to its arsenal "instead of 
the nuclear missiles that are being destroyed." Interestingly, 
Kravchuk divulged this "military secret" attesting to the 
president's tireless care about the army and the 
military-industrial complex precisely in the home stretch of the 
election race and precisely before the grateful audience of a 
military school. In the course of the Zhitomir tour, however, 
he also found what to say to the workers of a woodworking 
combine (prospects of the sector's growth), and to those who 
work in agriculture (also prospects, but those concerning 
agriculture). Should Kravchuk continue to concentrate on similar 
problems (avoiding the less than advantageous subject of the 
Black Sea Fleet) there may appear a chance for Russia and 
Ukraine finally to agree about the fleet.

  [Text] Ukraine said that in June it would pay $130 million 
to the Russian Gazprom joint stock company in accordance with 
the schedule for payment of the Ukrainian debt for natural gas 
delivery. The schedule was approved on 3-4 June during the 
visit of the Russian delegation headed by Gazprom Chairperson 
Rem Vyakhirev to Kiev, the Ukrainian Ukrgazprom joint stock 
company told INTERFAX- Ukraine. 
  During June-August 1994, Kiev will pay to Gazprom $500 
million and will deliver goods and services costing 500 billion 
rubles in order to pay its debt for Russian gas. 
  The total Ukrainian debt for Russian gas delivered during 
1993-94 was fixed in a protocol of 1 June 1994. The debt is 
more than $1 billion. 
  Russia sells gas to Ukraine for the price of $50 per 1000 
cubic meters. 
  During the visit the directors of Gazprom and Ukrgazprom 
signed an agreement on construction and purchase of dwellings 
and other social facilities on Russian and Ukrainian territory 
in order to cover a part of the Ukrainian debt for the delivered 
gas. In accordance with the agreement, Ukrainian companies will 
build on Russian territory 308,700 square meters of housing for 
Russian gas industry workers.

<F P=106> [Report by O. Volodin: "Only Together Can We Work </F>
Efficiently"] 
  [Text] Participants in the briefing held by Crimean Deputy 
Prime Minister Ye. Saburov on 28 May for media representatives 
assessed the events in the Crimean Supreme Soviet of the 
previous week when a number of deputies protested against the 
government's program, without even reading it. 
  Ye. Saburov read a statement calling the incident "a 
constitutional coup exemplified by the legislature's desire to 
replace the Executive Branch." According to the deputy prime 
minister, this scenario is identical to the developments in 
Moscow, cited by Saburov, when the former Russian Supreme Soviet 
embarked on a path of dangerous opposition against the Executive 
Branch represented by the president of the Russian Federation. 
Meanwhile, the paradox of the Crimean situation lies in the 
fact that numerous members of the Russia deputies' bloc opposed 
President Meshkov, those very people who used to pledge their 
loyalty to the president a while ago. 
  Saburov believes the banal fight for ministerial portfolios 
to be the primary cause for the parliamentary "mutiny." It is 
understood that the Russia bloc has the right to recommend its 
candidates for the posts in the Crimean Government. However, 
the deputy prime minister maintains that he is ready to consider 
only the candidacies of highly-competent professionals. 
  The views of the Crimean president on personnel issues 
coincide with those of Saburov. Unfortunately, their opponents 
in the legislature take an absolutely different approach. That 
is why they are persistently supporting the myth of the 
"invasion of bureaucrats from Moscow," despite the fact that 
only five Muscovites are actually working in the government. 
  The deputy prime minister rejected the accusations by 
lawmakers who claim that the government has no distinct program 
for overcoming the crisis. Saburov pointed out: "We have 
already started implementing this program despite the 
clandestine sabotage by a number of senior officials, including 
the management of Crimea's National Bank. Due to the fact that 
the latter refused to obey the Crimean president's edict 
granting local enterprises the right to sell currency at market 
prices, Crimea has probably lost several million dollars. The 
implementation of the program is also being upset by populist 
claims by a number of deputies who are demanding 
"liberalization" of taxes, in disregard of the fact that the 
government is facing grave difficulties financing the Crimean 
budget." 
  Putting spokes in the government's wheels in the current 
critical period, planting a mine under the relations between the 
president and the legislature of Crimea, the people's deputies, 
according to Saburov, push Kiev officials toward harsh measures 
against Crimean autonomy. 
  Asked by a KRYMSKAYA PRAVDA reporter about possible measures 
to be taken by the government in case the Supreme Soviet takes 
no steps to meet the Executive Branch half-way on personnel 
issues, Saburov briefly answered: "The government will continue 
to perform its duties proceeding from the interests of the 
people of Crimea." He strongly recommended the legislature not 
to stand in the government's way and to finally get down to 
serious lawmaking. Saburov stressed: "Only together can we work 
efficiently."

  [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk submitted to 
parliament his proposals on measures to be taken if the Crimean 
parliament fails to bring its legislation in line with the 
Ukrainian Constitution, head of the presidential press office , 
Nikolai Mikhalchenko, told INTERFAX-Ukraine. However, he 
declined to indicate what measures were proposed by the 
president. 
  "What happens next depends on the parliament. The Ukrainian 
parliament is responsible for relations with Crimea, and the 
president has no powers to interfere," he added.

<F P=106> [Report by Serhiy Rakhmanin: "Leonid Kravchuk's Kharkov </F>
Pilgrimage"] 
  [Text] President Kravchuk's voyage to Kharkov Oblast on 
the eve of elections is not accidental. Many politicians and 
sociologists believe this region to be the domain of Leonid 
Kuchma, that is why Leonid Kravchuk and his team are going to 
face strenuous work with the Kharkov electorate. One cannot 
rule out that the visit to the former Ukrainian capital was to 
some extent prompted by the need to talk to local administration 
head Oleksandr Maselskyy whose name was included in the "secret 
lists of presidential candidates." 
  In the course of his visit to one of the largest Ukrainian 
oblasts, Leonid Kravchuk met with the managers' corps of 
agricultural machine-building enterprises, agrarians, and 
workers of the gas complex. It is quite natural that under the 
extraordinary circumstances -- it is not every day that the head 
of state comes on a visit -- complaints, requests, and 
suggestions were received and, in some cases, passed for 
consideration to the National Bank Chairman Viktor Yushchenko, 
Minister of Agriculture Yuriy Karasyk, Minister of Economy 
Anatoliy Holubchenko, and other accompanying members of the 
president's apparatus. 
  The state leader did not omit political issues. He paid lip 
service to the new Supreme Council adding that the latter would 
be unable to resolve any serious issues: "All they can do is 
squabble." He hinted that deputies, absorbed in political 
battles, have no time to think of the people. He said that he 
was sorry to see the few good things that have been created, 
turning to dust: "We introduced the post of presidential envoys 
in the provinces. Hardly have these people managed to gain 
weight when a hue and cry was raised: `That post is a hindrance, 
let us go back to the past.' Meanwhile, they mean a worse 
version of this `past'." He criticized those political forces 
that make profits on speculations about people's hardships: "So 
far, I have not seen people in Ukraine who either starve or wear 
rags." 
  Mr. Kravchuk called on the Kharkov residents to go to the 
ballot and elect professionals with statesmanlike mentality. 
Leonid Kravchuk rejected the claims that he is blocking the 
process of restoring economic ties with Russia, saying that 
Ukraine has acceded to all the appropriate CIS documents and 
signed all the necessary agreements with Russia. Those 
agreements do not yield results simply because mechanisms for 
their implementation do not exist and "everybody is upholding 
their own interests." Those "ardent internationalists" that 
accuse Leonid Kravchuk of being a nationalist, do this just to 
win cheap prestige. 
  The president pointed out: "With regard to the economic 
union with Russia, I have no powers to sign it for there exists 
an appropriate Supreme Council resolution. I should not be 
blamed for this. Once the legislature rescinds its reservation 
I will sign an agreement." 
  Leonid Kravchuk bitterly criticized the idea of a Slavic 
union and deemed the plans to form this kind of structure a 
provocation and an attempt to change the borders and thus, cause 
a war.

  [Text] On 7 June in Simferopol, the Crimean Supreme 
Council held its regular plenary session, at which it discussed 
a document produced by a working group of Ukrainian and Crimean 
deputies. 
  The session definitively confirmed the division of the 
"Rossiya" bloc into the "Rossiya" (around 40 people) and 
"Respublika" (10 people) factions. The former approved the 
document, in which "Respublika" members termed its position as 
"treacherous." 
  It was decided to consider the document and to submit it to 
the Crimean Supreme Council Presidium for discussion.

  [Text] ITAR-TASS reported today that at a meeting with 
employees of the Interior Affairs Ministry, the head of the 
Crimean parliament, Tsekov, called on them not to accept jobs at 
the Crimean Main Interior Affairs Administration at the 
Ukrainian Interior Affairs Ministry. The Crimean Supreme 
Soviet, he declared, will do its best to preserve the Crimean 
Interior Affairs Ministry and ensure its operations. This will 
be done, Tsekov continued, by raising taxes and introducing 
other unpopular measures, including lifting state subsidies for 
bread. I asked Militia Colonel Ivan (Leskiv), chief of the Main 
Public Relations Department at the Ukrainian Interior Ministry, 
to comment on the ITAR-TASS report. 
  [Begin recording] [(Leskiv]) Let me remind you that on 18 
May, by edict of Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, the 
Crimean Interior Affairs Ministry was reorganized into the 
Crimean Main Interior Affairs Administration within the 
Ukrainian Interior Affairs Ministry. However, some Crimean 
politicians are bluntly ignoring this legislative act. The Main 
Public Relations Department at the Ukrainian Interior Ministry 
is convinced that the above declaration will result only in 
further embroiling the militia in the political [word 
indistinct]. It is clear what a heavy burden those 
ill-considered decisions can prove for Crimean residents -- and 
not only for them. [words indistinct] because at present, the 
Crimea is virtually funded by the Ukrainian budget, consuming 
more than it produces. As for the newly created Main 
Administration, it has been financed by the Ukrainian Interior 
Affairs Ministry budget from the beginning. It receives the 
necessary equipment to ensure normal operation of all the 
Crimean Interior Affairs bodies and subunits. This is why 
high-ranking officials reacted with surprise to the declaration 
and, even more so, the speed with which the Russian media 
reported it. This by no means promote will promote unity and 
cohesion among the ranks of Interior Affairs Ministry employees 
or lower the already high crime rate in the Republic. 
  Over the past five months, the crime rate rose more than 14 
percent in the Crimea. Violence accounts for a considerable 
part of all crimes committed. This type of crime has risen by 
326 percent, while arrests have decreased. Street and group 
crimes increased substantially. Every second robbery and every 
fourth assault or case of hooliganism were committed on the 
streets and in other public places. Almost half the crimes were 
committed by citizens under the influence of alcohol. With the 
militia distracted from performing its duties and the political 
interference in the operations of the Crimean Interior Affairs 
Administration, criminals are becoming even more arrogant. This 
causes concern and anxiety not only for the Crimean population, 
but also for the entire Ukraine. 
  Hoping for success of the negotiations initiated in the 
Crimea, one would like to be confident that at this complicated 
and crucial time, the Crimean president and Supreme Soviet will 
display political wisdom and foresight in legally resolving the 
artificially created problems in regard to the Interior 
Ministry. [end recording]

  [Text] A RID reporter has learned that the Republican and 
Minsk City Councils [as heard] and the Movement for Democracy, 
Social Progress, and Justice have issued appeals to presidential 
candidates Dubko, Kebich, Lukashenka, and Novikaw. 
  The statements, in particular, urge the candidates to annul 
the Viskuli agreements [leading to the dissolution of USSR], to 
halt the (?capitalist) path of development of the Republic, to 
strengthen and develop the soviets as organs of genuine power of 
the people, to abolish the presidency, to terminate the 
privatization of the all-people ownership, to liquidate the 
existing state symbols by 3 July 1994, to recognize the equal 
rights of the Belarusian and Russian languages, and to restore 
the holiday on 7 November [the day when the socialist revolution 
was held] in their election programs.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Mainayev] </F>
  [Text] Bishkek 10 June TASS -- Kirghiz [Kyrgyz] President 
Askar Akayev spoke about promised credits to his country with a 
radiant smile just a few weeks ago. However, his smile 
disappeared a few days ago after he completed his visit to 
Belgium and France on 4 June. 
  "I told the leadership of the European Community Commission 
(ECC)," Akayev said at a meeting with journalists after the 
European visit, "that their stiff conditions and interest rates 
are neck-breaking for the Republic." 
  The president called the ECC credit "holdup of a beggar." He 
told virtually the same to Indian foreign minister who visited 
Bishkek this week. The only difference was that he described 
the deplorable situation of his country. 
  The president said that Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan] does not 
enjoy 
the same rating as neighbouring Central Asian countries, adding 
"Turkmenia [Turkmenistan], for instance, is wallowing in 
petrodollars. The Turkmen president is building a palace worth 
400 million U.S. dollars. 
  "On the other hand, I could only scratch $500 million all 
over Europe for a three-year programme for reforming the 
Republic," he stressed. 
  Kazakhstan, Akayev continued, leads the entire continent in 
the production of non-ferrous metals and is a member of the 
nuclear pool. Uzbekistan has large deposits of gas and oil. It 
annually produces over 100 tonnes of gold and harvests millions 
of tonnes of cotton. 
  Kirghizia is a poor country, the president repeated: 98 per 
cent of all energy resources are imported by it at prices which 
are 50 per cent higher than on world markets. 
  Akayev told journalists that he has been persuading the 
organisation for economic cooperation and development for two 
years to put the republic on the list of developing countries, 
since it needs easy-term credits to be repaid by instalments. 
  "We are a small but proud people," he added. "If we take a 
loan, we should be sure that we shall pay it in time."

  [Text] Moscow, 9 June, IRNA -- Turkmen President Saparmurat 
Niyazov on Thursday [9 June] expressed satisfaction with 
Tehran-Ashkhabad relations and underscored the "importance" of 
cooperation between the two neighbors in the Caspian Sea. 
  Niyazov made the remarks in a meeting with the visiting 
Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Morteza Sarmadi in Ashkhabad. 
  Sarmadi said relations between Iran and Turkmenistan were a 
model among other regional states and emphasized that bilateral 
relations could not only benefit both nations but could also 
play an "effective" role in maintaining security and stability 
in Central Asia. 
  The two sides also exchanged views on ways of implementing 
agreements previously reached between Iranian and Turkmen 
presidents in the holy city of Mashhad, outcome of Niyazov's 
recent visit to Indonesia and Malaysia, map of Sarakhs-Tajan

  [Text] Yerevan, 9 Jun -- Siting of Russian military bases 
in Armenia, service by Armenian lads in Russian units stationed 
on the state's territory, and also conditions of bringing 
peacemaking forces into the region -- these questions are at the 
center of attention at talks Russian Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev has been having today with the Republic's leaders. He 
is making a working trip round the Transcaucasus. 
  As you know, at a meeting of military department heads of 
Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Nagorno-Karabakh with the mediation of 
Pavel Grachev, a protocol was drafted on the first stage of a 
settlement -- cease-fire and disengagement of the sides. By the 
end of May, it was planned to introduce about 1,800 Russian 
peacemakers into the conflict zone, but the protocol was not 
signed by the Azeri side, which insisted that practically 
simultaneously with the disengagement of the forces Armenia 
should start freeing the Azeri territories it seized in the 
course of the conflict. This is the problem Pavel Grachev has 
to discuss at his coming meeting on 11 June in Baku with 
Azeribaijani President Heydar Aliyev.

Kochetkov and Mikhail Shevtsov] 
  [Text] Tbilisi 10 June TASS -- The question about the 
establishment of Russian military bases on Armenian territory 
has been resolved positively, Russian Defence Minister Pavel 
Grachev said before flying to Tbilisi, capital of Georgia. 
  According to Grachev, the bases in Gyumri and Yerevan will 
be 
formed before 1 August. The minister expressed satisfaction 
with his trip to Yerevan and said that all military problems 
scheduled for discussion were solved and approved by the 
leadership of Armenia. 
  Armenian Defence Minister Serzh Sargsyan told ITAR-TASS he 
was pleased with the results of Minister Grachev's visit, which 
he described as "a very important and serious visit, the main 
results of which will be the deployment of Russian military 
bases in Armenia, the strengthening of the Republic's air 
defenses and the reinforcement of the Russian troops deployed 
here." 
  Russian Ambassador to Armenia Vladimir Stupishin said 
General 
Grachev's visit to Yerevan was an important political landmark. 
"It was very important from the viewpoint of strengthening our 
allied relations with Armenia both in the frame of the treaty of 
collective security of the Commonwealth of Independent States 
and on a bilateral basis," he said. 
  In Tbilisi, the Russian defence minister was welcomed by 
Prime Minister Otar Patsatsiya, Parliament Vice-Speaker Vakhtang 
Rcheulishvili, members of the Georgian Government and the 
commander of the Russian troops in the Caucasus, Colonel-General 
Fedor Reut. A guard of honour was mustered on the tarmac and a 
military band played the anthems of the two countries. 
  The motorcade then sped from the airport to the building of 
the Cabinet of Ministers, where a meeting has begun between the 
Russian defence minister and Georgian leader Eduard 
Shevardnadze. The conversation deals with the timetable and a 
mechanism of introducing CIS peacekeepers, including a Russian 
contingent to the zone of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. 
  On Friday afternoon, Minister Grachev is due to fly to 
Gudauta for analogous coordination of actions with the Abkhaz 
side. 
  The Russian defence minister is expected to return to 
Tbilisi 
on Friday evening and meet the generals and officers of the 
Russian troops stationed in the Transcaucasus on Saturday.

  [Text] Moscow, 9 Jun -- First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg 
Soskovets has categorically refuted a report that appeared in 
the press about the possible resignation for health reasons of 
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and the appointment 
of Yuriy Skokov to this post. He called such information 
complete garbage. 
  A well-informed source in the government told the ITAR-TASS 
correspondent today that this evening Chernomyrdin was returning 
from Germany. But the question of his participation in 
tomorrow's all-Russian builders' conference in the Kremlin with 
the participation of the Russian president currently remained 
open. In all probability, Soskovets would deliver a report 
there. 
  Aleksandr Livshits, head of the Russian president's group of 
experts, told the ITAR-TASS correspondent the following 
concerning the fabrications about the possible resignation of 
Chernomyrdin: Such rumors are advantageous only to those who are 
trying to snatch power, and for this purpose to set at 
loggerheads the leaders of the government and the president's 
administration. We are working amid continuous malevolence, but 
our team of reformers will not let this put their nose out of 
joint. 
  At the federation of goods producers, which is chaired by 
Yuriy Skokov, whom the authors of the article in KOMSOMOLSKAYA 
PRAVDA have destined for the post of prime minister, the 
ITAR-TASS correspondent was told: This is mere fiction and 
nothing else, and it is a pity that it compromises our 
federation's leader.

  [Excerpt] [Correspondent Aleksandr Shashkov] Today the 
Russian president and the chairman of the Federation Council 
discussed the work of Parliament's upper chamber, on whose 
deputies the country's future budget depends so much. 
  Vladimir Shumeyko made public his views on the budget, which 
has already been adopted by the State Duma, at a meeting with 
the correspondent. 
  [Shumeyko] In my view the budget is like porridge plastered 
on a plate. 
  [Shashkov] Instead of being aimed at, say, the 
reconstruction 
of the economy or support for the military industrial complex, 
the budget, in the opinion of the Federation Council chairman, 
is just a record of the government's expenditure. 
  [Shumeyko] The Federation Council naturally will not agree 
to 
such a budget; at least I personally do not agree to it. 
  [Shashkov] From Vladimir Shumeyko's viewpoint, the 
difference 
in approach to the budget between the two chambers of parliament 
comes down to the fact that the upper chamber represents the 
state, while the lower chamber does not. 
  [Shumeyko] I have the impression that the Duma, thanks to 
the 
fact that it has a political set up and not a state one, by 
adopting this budget shows -- or so I think -- the worse the 
better, we'll change the authorities more quickly. But this is 
not a matter of replacing the authorities, it is a matter of 
strengthening the state. 
  [Shashkov] A few minutes earlier, Shumeyko shared his 
impressions on his visit to the strategic missile troops. Here, 
this was not a matter of strengthening the state. It seems that 
strategic missiles... 
  [Shumeyko, interrupting] ...Give us confidence that, while 
we 
have them and are occupied here with political wars and other 
business to ensure the collapse of the state, but not construct 
it, we can at least be sure that no one is going to touch us for 
the time being. [passage omitted]

  [Text] North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam said on 
8 June that if the United States agrees to resume the third 
round of DPRK-U.S. talks, North Korea will allow the 
International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect its nuclear 
facilities in Yongbyon. In a news conference after winding up 
his Ukraine visit, Kim Yong-nam said that if the DPRK-U.S. talks 
are resumed, North Korea will guarantee the inspection of the 
nuclear facilities, including the test, measurement, and 
preservation of the fuel rods. 
  Kim Yong-nam also said that the United States is rejecting 
the resumption of the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks by 
carrying out stalling tactics. He added that since the United 
States and North Korea are the parties directly involved in this 
matter, the only way to resolve this matter is through the 
United States and North. He pointed out that the nuclear issue 
was caused by the United States and that the threat against the 
DPRK stems from the United States.

<F P=106> [Report by Nataliya Filipchuk: "When It Is Time To Hurry </F>
Up...."] 
  [Text] Finally the emotions stirred by Crimea calmed down 
a bit and politicians began to ponder: When did the Crimean 
problem emerge? Was it in 1783 when the Crimea was annexed by 
the Russian Empire or in 1954 when the devastated peninsula, 
lacking a national affiliation, was handed over to Ukraine, 
which played the role of an intensive care unit? Or, was it in 
1991 when Ukraine permitted the referendum and then acknowledged 
Crimean autonomy thus planting a time bomb? What is the 
underlying cause of the Crimean problem, how should it be 
resolved, and what consequences can it produce -- these were the 
central questions asked at a press conference called by the 
group of strategic researchers, "Young Europeans for Security," 
(the Institute of Strategic Research), the Mejlis of the Crimean 
Tatars, and the "Reforms" Ukrainian Supreme Council deputies' 
group. 
  In the opinion of Refat Chubarov, leader of the Kurultay 
faction at the Crimean Supreme Soviet, the Crimean problem 
emerged when it was separated from the problem of the Crimean 
Tatars. This is why it needs to be resolved based on these 
people. Chubarov believes that this is possible when three 
conditions are met: the legal basis, money, and stability at the 
Crimean peninsula. Only, how can it be achieved? By turning a 
blind eye on illegal actions of the Crimean parliament and 
accepting relations between Ukraine and its integral part on a 
treaty basis? Politicians advocating this option make a 
mistake. There is no guarantee that in half a year, those 
treaties will not be unilaterally broken. 
  Chubarov cited a draft appeal by the majority in the Crimean 
parliament to the Russian State Duma that said: "The Crimean 
Supreme Soviet counts on decisive actions taken along with the 
State Duma regarding the final determination of the Crimea's 
status as part of Russian Federation." Obviously, the 
far-reaching plans of the present Crimean parliament cannot be 
changed even by an agreement between Ukraine and Russia on the 
Black Sea Fleet (if one is possible any time soon). 
  In this situation, the Ukrainian Supreme Council ought to 
assume full powers and responsibility for resolving the 
conflict. As for practical implementation of decisions by the 
Ukrainian parliament, the Crimean people, perhaps the most 
powerful force in the Crimea upholding the Ukrainian interests, 
is willing to handle this issue. "The Crimea's native people 
must be returned to their homeland, and they will decide about 
the future of the peninsula," Mustafa Dzemilev, head of the 
Crimean Mejlis, stated at a press conference. But of 492 billion 
karbovanets [K] in capital investment and the K197 billion 
allocated from the Ukrainian budget, Crimean Tatars have so far 
received only K100 billion. This makes Turkey's assistance in 
financing and building 1,000 apartments even more valuable and 
timely. 
  However, may be for the first time ever, the problem was 
raised at the press conference of Ukraine's weakening control 
over the Crimean economy and on privatization, in particular. 
In the words of Vyacheslav Shved, an expert from the strategic 
research group, Russian capital intensified its influence in the 
region. For example, Russian corporations "Twentieth Century," 
"Arbat-Moscow," "Alpha Capital," and others surprisingly quickly 
buy out Crimean assets, capturing 10 to 15 percent of all 
sanatoriums. By the end of 1994, according to Meshkov's edict, 
it is planned to privatize 19 enterprises key for the Crimean 
economy, including ports. There is no guarantee that this 
Ukrainian property, too, will not change its "citizenship." 
  The most regrettable thing is, as deputy Viktor Pynzenyk, 
leader of the "Reforms" legislative group, noted, that although 
it was an illegal action, Meshkov was right signing this and 
other edicts concerning taxes, currency regulation, and the 
banking system. Ukraine has no laws that would provide 
enterprises with free access to currency and credits and that 
would not hinder privatization. The Crimeans very deftly shifted 
emphasis from economy to politics, covering at the same time 
their tails by progressive, if not perfect, reforms. 
  So, it is obvious that the Crimean problem was caused by 
many 
reasons and has many solutions. Yet another one was proposed by 
Ukrainian President L. Kravchuk during a meeting at the 
Ukrainian Supreme Council: one should straighten out relations 
with Russia. The most important thing is not to miss the chance, 
even though they say "hurry without haste." But does it really 
have to be that way in all our history?

<F P=106> [Report by BELINFORM correspondent Viktor Sakhankov for TASS] </F>
  [Text] Minsk, 9 June -- Speaking on Wednesday [8 June] 
evening before representatives of workers' collectives in the 
city of Mogilyov, prime minister of Belarusia Vyacheslav Kebich 
expressed confidence in the inevitability of a durable alliance 
between the three fraternal peoples of Russia, Ukraine and 
Belarusia. He believes this is determined by the historical 
necessity to live together, the economic interests and ancient 
cultural ties. 
  Belarusians cannot and will not be spongers of Russians 
while 
participating in inter-state division of labor and cooperating 
with them on a mutually advantageous basis in all spheres of 
life, the premier noted. 
  The agreement on the unification of the monetary systems of 
the two countries is the first step towards a closer alliance, 
and the head of the Belarusian government is doing everything in 
his power to put into practice these aspirations of the peoples 
of both countries. 
  Touching on national minorities in sovereign Belarusia, 
Vyacheslav Kebich said that for him such a term was 
unacceptable. People of different nationalities live in 
Belarusia and there cannot be any pretext for inter-ethic 
strife, the Belarusian prime minister emphasized.

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "Care for Veterans"] </F>
  [Text] On the recommendation of Ruslan Aushev, president 
of Ingushetia and chairman of the Council of the CIS Heads of 
Government Committee for Internationalist Troops, the 
Interparliamentary Assembly Council adopted at its session 
yesterday a decree in which the attention of the parliaments of 
the Interparliamentary Assembly's member states is drawn to the 
necessity of providing internationalist troops and their 
families with a full degree of social and legal protection. 
  "The Interparliamentary Assembly Council adopted this 
decision affecting the future of more than 700,000 people with 
practically no discussion," Vladimir Shumeyko said in an 
exclusive interview for an ITAR-TASS correspondent. He 
emphasized that, unfortunately, questions of state social 
assistance and legal protection for veterans of wars and 
military operations in various countries are being resolved with 
difficulty in the CIS, and advocated improving the system to 
implement interstate legal acts on assistance to veterans 
adopted within the framework of the CIS, including the 
monitoring of their execution by the sovereign states' supreme 
legislative organs. Shumeyko expressed the hope that the 
programs for material and everyday and medical provision for war 
veterans agreed by the CIS countries will be backed by budgetary 
finances.

<F P=106> [Interview with Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev by </F>
Vitaliy Portnikov in the "Leader" column: "Nursultan 
Nazarbayev: `There Is No Need To Look for What Is Not There.' 
The Kazakhstan President Wants To Remember Only the Good 
Things" -- place, date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Portnikov] Nursultan Abishevich, the full 
text of your project on creating a Eurasian union has been 
published. Has there been any initial response to this document, 
and, generally, what sort of response do you expect knowing the 
reaction that your initiative has provoked? 
  [Nazarbayev] There has been some reaction from the 
international democratic movement in Russia. Mr. Smirnov, 
organizing committee chairman, sent a cable advising that on 18 
June a special forum will be held in support of this 
undertaking. Today there was a phone call from Sergey Shakhray 
who congratulated me, saying that he had read the full text in 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: Thanks to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA for that. He 
fully approves of the text of this project and proposes to hold 
a special conference on the 14th that will be attended by 
leading politicians of Russia, including leaders of the Federal 
Assembly. My deputy chief of staff and the deputy premier in 
charge of these matters will go there. Prior to this there was a 
conversation with Eduard Shevardnadze, to whom I had earlier 
sent the document, and he stated his support. This seems to be 
all so far but still not much time has passed; some people 
thought that I just made an impromptu statement in Moscow 
speaking before chief editors in Moscow University. But in 
fact, this is an idea I have been contemplating for a long time. 
No one can be content with the CIS that we have today. Some 
400 documents that are not being implemented. I am not saying 
that the CIS is not serving its purpose and that it must be 
disbanded. It must be good to have something rather than 
nothing. But the CIS is moving in one direction, and life in 
another. Now there are 65 posts on the border between Russia 
and Kazakhstan which look very much like border checkpoints, not 
customs houses, and I want to issue an edict unilaterally 
removing all customs barriers in the direction of Russia. I 
propose to put in place normal supra-national coordinating 
bodies. There should be no fear that sovereignty will be lost, 
and so forth. It is generally believed that common sovereignty 
is superior to each separate sovereignty of a particular state, 
and that it is more useful. If there is a Eurasian Union 
Executive Committee empowered to oversee the implementation of 
our documents; if there is a body empowered to apply sanctions 
for failure to observe an accord; if there is a real common 
economic space; and if we lift customs barriers, multinational 
companies and joint ventures will emerge, and producers will 
find their own way around. It is only essential not to choke 
off this way to them. [passage omitted] 
  [Portnikov] After your meeting in Ashkhabad [Ashgabat] with 
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and then after your official 
visit to Kiev; following your meeting in Ashkhabad with Eduard 
Shevardnadze, and then after your contacts with him in Moscow, 
some observers and politicians got the impression that a new 
axis of states, as it were, is being created, setting themselves 
somewhat against the growing influence and pressure from Russia. 
On the other hand, there are your contacts with your Central 
Asian colleagues. Regional integration here is also perceived 
in Russia as an alternative to the processes under way in the 
CIS and around Russia. To what extent do you think this 
perception is correct? 
  [Nazarbayev] I know about such talk. Some time ago the 
question of a Baltic-Black Sea belt was aired very broadly. I 
would like to say that Kazakhstan must never, and will never, 
engage in any intrigues against Russia. This does not respond 
to its historic or strategic interests. These interests are 
that Kazakhstan should have a friendly, close relationship with 
Russia, based on mutual trust. This is a strategic goal. None 
of us here has any objection when, say, Boris Yeltsin begins to 
work with Poland and Germany and a certain belt is being created 
there. As far as concerns our efforts, jointly with Uzbekistan 
and Kirgizia [Kyrgyzstan], to create a single market space, 
lifting all customs barriers (people are only grateful to us for 
that), we are thus setting a good example. And, to avert any 
talk to the effect that we are forming a certain belt, let us 
form a Eurasian union. This is an open and fair proposition. 
  [Portnikov] You seem to have pretty good contacts with 
Ukraine, and still it is obviously not a candidate for the 
Eurasian Union.... 
  [Nazarbayev] If someone does not get into the Eurasian 
Union, this does not mean that we should not have a good 
relationship with that party. We have extensive economic 
contacts with Ukraine. We have an extensive economic interest 
there. And they too have a big interest in Kazakhstan. There 
is a similar interest on the part of other countries, and we are 
developing trade relations with Iran; our trade with Turkey is 
growing fast; and our trade with China has grown 250 times in 
two and a half years. Therefore I want to state quite 
unequivocally: It is wrong to suppose that Nazarbayev, 
Kazakhstan, seeks to create some bloc, one not very friendly 
toward Russia. This will not happen; one should not look for 
what is not there. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 11 TASS -- The fourth anniversary of 
the proclamation of the state sovereignty of the Russian 
Federation, which is due on June 12, is in the focus of 
attention of today's newspapers. 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carries an article on this subject, which is 
entitled "Forecasts Not Coming True: Russia is not Flourishing, 
but Neither has it Slided Down into the Abyss." The tactical and 
even strategic importance of this day in the struggle of the new 
centre with the old one, that of the Soviet Union, cannot be 
overestimated, the newspaper writes. "Against the background of 
the more and more obvious weakening of the Gorbachev 
administration the idea of sovereignty as a cure-all, as about 
the only hope for the revival, was gaining popularity and 
support ... It has been repeated too often, but it is a fact 
that Russia was virtually restored from ashes on more than one 
occasion after far more serious upheavals. So, the hope is still 
here." 
  The newspaper sets forth President Yeltsin's speech at the 
Friday press conference, devoted to Russia's Independence Day. 
The article is entitled "President Optimistic About the Future." 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI frontpages the statement saying that to 
ponder over this historic date means, in the first place, "to 
ponder over the importance of this country. Even in the most 
difficult of times Russians continue to think about the role 
played by their country in the world. As a rule, such thoughts 
develop into ambitious projects and undertakings, which shake 
the foundations of this (and not only this) country and, 
unfortunately, do not always bring the desired results. Voices 
can be heard more and more often, which warn the authorities 
against taking hasty 'ambitious' decision, no matter how 
attractive they may look ..." The newspaper emphasizes the words 
of Sergey Filatov, chief of staff of President Yeltsin's 
Administration, that the coming anniversary confirms the fact 
that "by gaining independence, the Russian Federation has been 
preserved as an integrated state and continues to be 
consolidated." 
  TRUD frontpages a report about President Yeltsin's press 
conference under the headline "A New Political Reality has Taken 
Shape in the Country." The newspaper quotes the president's 
answer to the question of a TRUD correspondent about his 
assessment of propsects of the establishment of social democracy 
in Russia. Yeltsin's said: "I think there is a basis in Russia 
for the development of social democracy. We shall have a true 
social democratic party or movement." 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA emphasizes Yeltsin's words that "I will 
not surrender Chernomyrdin, even to KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA." The 
newspaper points out that Deputy Prime Minister Anatoliy Chubays 
obviously lost the battle to Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov and was 
publicly rebuked by the president, who asked First Deputy Prime 
Minister Oleg Soskovets to tell Chubays to keep away from 
Moscow's problems." 
  SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA and PRAVDA strongly criticise Yeltsin's 
performance on the post of the president. SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA 
carries excerpts from a manuscript of Leonid Velikodny, former 
air force pilot, who describes the team of the authors of 
perestroyka as "amateurs and saboteurs." 
  PRAVDA publishes an article on the same subject, stressing 
that, in its opinion, the future of President Yeltsin is rather 
bleak. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries a report about Yeltsin's press 
conference under the headline "On the Eve of the Third 
Anniversary of his Presidency, Yeltsin Announces All-Out Advance 
of the Economic Reform, but Puts Luzhkov in Charge of 
Privatization in Moscow." 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries as well an interview with Kazakh 
President Nursultan Nazarbayev, which deals with his plan of 
creating an Euroasian union. According to Nazarbayev, 
"Kazakhstan should never plan anything detrimental to Russia, 
and it never will. This does not meet its strategic and historic 
interests. It is in line with Kazakhstan's interest to be on 
friendly terms with Russia, to be close to it and confident of 
each other's goodwill. This is the strategic goal." 
  Jan Eliasson, head of the CSCE Minsk Group for the 
settlement 
of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, said in an interview with 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA that he welcomes "Russia's energetic effort 
aimed at achieving ceasefire." "Russia's role in the region is 
indisputable, and we should take advantage of its knowledge and 
experience for settling the conflict," he said. 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI publishes an interview with Sergey 
Shakhray. He believes that federalism today is the only way to 
preserve a stable political regime and the unity of the state.

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Already at the beginning of the 
election campaign, concern was voiced (?at the session of the 
Collegium of the Defense Ministry) over an increase in political 
and information tension around the Armed Forces. Currently, 
these negative trends are progressing. This caused the Defense 
Ministry to release a statement. 
  The statement says that lately some political structures 
have 
made attempts to speak on behalf of the Armed Forces trying to 
impose their own presidential candidate. Worries are also 
triggered by antiarmy sentiments present in the programs and 
speeches of some presidential candidates. 
  In connection with this, the Defense Ministry states that 
the 
Armed Forces decisively dissociates itself from all attempts 
made by political parties and organizations to involve it in 
battles for power. 
  Another segment from the statement released by the Collegium 
of the Defense Ministry states: Servicemen are full-fledged 
citizens of the Republic. During the elections, they have the 
right to exercise their constitutional right, to express their 
own will, and to vote for any candidate who actually has the 
interests of the state in mind.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 9/6/1994 -- "We consider that 
the discussion itself on the granting of a special juridical 
status to districts populated by the Gagauz ethnics or to the 
Dniester region emerged through the pressure of the Russian 
empire, which is trying to stimulate separatism in Moldova," 
declared to BASAPRESS Iurie Rosca, the leader of the Alliance of 
Christian Democratic People's Front of Moldova [AFPCDM]. The 
members of the AFPCDM consider that the Gagauz issue can be 
solved by adopting a regulation, which would represent the 
interests of national minorities. "Such a law exists: It was 
adopted by the former parliament and was named the Law on 
National Minorities," mentioned Rosca, adding that 
decentralization of state power would contribute to a faster 
settlement of the dispute with the Southern districts. Rosca 
also declared that the adoption of a special juridical status 
for the Southern districts will mark the beginning of the 
federalization of the republic. "The AFPCDM will oppose this 
draft bill," declared Rosca.

  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 8/6/1994 -- The attempt on the 
national anthem is an attempt on Moldova's independence and 
sovereignty committed by the governing party, declared today 
Alexandru Arseni, chairman of the Moldovan Democratic Party of 
Labor (PDMM) at a press conference. Arseni also stated that the 
draft law on press is a draft pointed against the press; it 
violates the Universal Declaration on Human Rights stipulating 
the delivery of correct and uncensored information to people. 
"Under present conditions Moldova does not need a law on 
press," said Arseni. Vlad Darie, member of the PDMM 
Coordinating Council, mentioned that the governing party, PDMM, 
will be soon removed, and its place will be taken by the 
socialists and communists. Many mayors who did not support the 
PDMM during the electoral campaign were fired. Concerning this, 
the PDMM Republican Council made public a declaration calling 
"the extension of the results of the parliamentary elections on 
the local administrative organs a violation of the 
Constitution." "The PDMM informs the representatives of the 
CSCE, the European Council, foreign embassies and political 
parties and movements about the real threat of restoring 
totalitarianism and obscurantism in our country," says the 
declaration.

Republic made yesterday, 8 June, an official statement 
concerning the negotiations on the granting of a special 
juridical status to the Dniester region. According to the 
statement, Igor Smirnov accuses Moldovan President Mircea Snegur 
of avoiding and slowing the negotiations. The Tiraspol 
authorities also deny any correlation between the solution of 
the Dniester dispute and the solution of the southern districts' 
[ethnic Gagauz'] problems. The press service reports that 
"Smirnov asked Vladlen Vasev, special envoy of the Russian 
president to the negotiations, to put pressure on President 
Snegur in order to force the latter to speed up negotiations."

Joint Control Commission for overseeing the implementation of 
the Snegur-Yeltsin Convention in Dniester held today a session 
in Tighina (Bender). According to the report presented by the 
joint military command, the situation of the controlled zone was 
stable last week. There were cases when the control performed 
by military experts failed but this was not their fault. 
According to the report, the Dniester presidential 
representative Tom Zenovich impedes the military observers from 
controlling the Tighina fortress, where a Dniester motorized 
infantry battalion is located, thus breaching the Convention of 
21 July 1992. The joint military command obliged the observers 
to signal the cases when the agreements are violated and assure 
the removal of obstacles. The session pointed out that the 
sides reduced the number of peace-keeping forces. To solve this 
problem, Moldovan, Russian and Dniester military departments 
were proposed to hold consultations regarding the number of 
peace-keeping soldiers and the weapons they should carry.

<F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Selivanov under the "Dniester" rubric: </F>
"Colonel Bergman's Personal War. Fourteenth Army Military 
Commandant Undertakes To Impose Order"] 
  [Text] There is hardly a day without Tiraspol's being 
rocked by yet another scandal involving Colonel Mikhail Bergman, 
local commandant of the 14th Russian Army. The indefatigable 
colonel recently exposed the Dniester leaders, charging them 
with illegal possession of firearms allegedly stolen from 14th 
Army depots. On this basis, the military commandant urged the 
Russian Federation authorities to strip the Tiraspol leaders of 
their Russian citizenship which they are shamelessly abusing, he 
said. 
  In the latest incident, all Tiraspol was shocked at the 
story 
involving the 14th Army commandant's office seizing the property 
of their fellow serviceman, General Kurchin, who decided to move 
together with his family to Russia and packed his bags into two 
rail containers. Bergman's subordinates moved in and seized the 
containers, carted them downtown, and dumped the contents on the 
ground for all to see, as if to say: There, dear people, look 
how the Dniester public property embezzlers make their fortunes. 
  The mass media of the Dniester Moldovan Republic have been 
hyping information about a letter Bergman allegedly sent to 
Russian Federation Defense Minister Pavel Grachev personally. 
In it, having roasted Gen. Lebed, the 14th Army military 
commandant paints the situation in the Dniester Moldovan 
Republic in exceedingly dramatic light and suggests that Mr. 
Grachev charge himself with imposing order, which he promises to 
do inside the briefest space of time. Mr. Bergman has neither 
confirmed nor denied the existence of such a letter. 
  Informed observers are inclined to link the colonel's 
extraordinary behavior with his special service record. 
Virtually all of his service has been in Tiraspol, where he 
knows everyone and everything. One can only envy his vast 
connections in the most different social sections, and few doubt 
that the colonel uses the 14th Army commandant's office alone 
for support. Whereas for Gen. Lebed the local skirmishes are no 
more than a stage in his biography, for Col. Bergman they seem 
to be his whole life. His current heightened activity in the 
field of combating Dniester corruption coincides in time exactly 
with Tiraspol's decision to institute criminal libel proceedings 
against him and its request to the Russian Federation Defense 
Ministry to transfer Mikhail Bergman to serve in some other 
region.

  [Text] Tiraspol BASAPRESS, 9/6/1994 -- The 14th Russian 
Army press center made public a declaration stating that "on 4 
June the television station of the Dniester Republic broadcast 
the sensational news that the commander of the 14th Army's 
Tiraspol garrison, Colonel Mikhail Bergman sent a confidential 
letter to Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. According to 
the television station, which allegedly has a copy of the 
letter, Bergman demanded Grachev's consent in `deposing the 
Dniester Republic's leadership.' The 14th Army command calls the 
`intentional misinformation' broadcast by the television station 
as an attempt to involve the Russian top leadership in the 
current dirty political intrigues. The press center notes that 
they contacted the Russian defense ministry and that no letter 
has been received from Colonel Bergman. The defense ministry 
also said that if such a letter had been received, it would have 
been sent to General Lebed to take 'proper measures against 
instigators.' The 14th Army commander was compelled to send the 
Russian defense ministry the entire text of the letter allegedly 
written by Bergman." "The analysis of the letter shows the 
complicity of certain structures of the self-proclaimed Dniester 
Republic in destabilizing the social-political situation and the 
justification of the extension of the state of emergency," 
states the 14th Army press center.

was to find some documents proving the complicity of Colonel 
[Mikhail] Bergman [the commander of the Dniester garrison of the 
14th Russian Army] and General Aleksandr Lebed [commander of the 
14th Russian Army] in the assassination attempt against Dniester 
prosecutor Boris Luchik.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 9/6/1994 -- The negotiations 
between the Moldovan and Romanian Ministries of Foreign Affairs 
on changing the status of the [border crossing] points of 
Cahul-Oancea, Sculeni-Sculeni Giurgiulesti, and Costesti-Stanca 
began today in Galati, Romania. The Moldovan delegation, headed 
by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Alexandru Burian, is 
comprised by representatives of customs departments. Sources 
from the government told BASAPRESS that these negotiations are 
held according to the 15 February 1994 Governmental Agreement. 
According to it, some passage points would be granted 
international status. The same source mentioned that the, 
Cahul-Oancea, Sculeni-Sculeni Giurgiulesti, and Costesti-Stanca 
passage points were opened in 1991 to facilitate border traffic 
and serve only Moldovan and Romanian citizens and economic 
companies. At the same time, Ukraine and other East European 
countries want to cross their goods and passengers at these 
points, at Giurgiulesti, in particular. The negotiations in 
Galati will not alter the passage regulations for Moldovan and 
Romanian citizens. Economic experts assert that one of the most 
difficult problems arising with this change of the passage 
points' status would be the creation of conditions corresponding 
to European standards for which Moldova is unprepared.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 9/6/1994 -- Dniester mass media 
announced a possible withdrawal of the Moldovan police from 
Tighina (Bender.) Victor Catana, the co-chairman of the Join 
Control Commission, told BASAPRESS that this is untrue. "Bender 
is an inseparable part of Moldova and thus the city police is a 
constitutional organ," he said. According to the [1992] Snegur- 
Yeltsin agreement, the city is declared a zone of high security 
and, hence, the Moldovan police's presence in Tighina is 
established by the same agreement, said Catana. According to 
him, the local administration subordinated to the 
self-proclaimed Dniester Republic exerts pressure on the police 
and this results in increased crime. "Regardless of these 
actions the police will stay in Bender to perform its duty of 
protecting public order and the rights and interests of the 
people," concluded Catana.

  [Text] Chisinau, ROMPRES, 8/6/1994 -- The current 
government makes efforts not to allow peasants to take part in 
land privatization, stated today during a press conference 
Semion Certan, Alliance of Moldovan Free Peasants [ATLM] 
chairman. Land privatization is blocked and there are 
anti-reform forces which neglect the provisions of the Land 
Code, added Certan. According to him, "the peasants are 
deliberately misinformed on the manner of taxation; the 
legislation on registering farms is ignored, while the 
preferential and foreign credits do not reach their 
beneficiaries in fair portions. Often they are distributed to 
collective farms." Ilie Untila, deputy chairman of the Alliance, 
stated to reporters that in many villages peasants cannot 
receive their plots of land; those who received their share of 
land did not receive their share of inventory. Contrary to the 
legislation, the peasants are forced to pay the taxes in kind. 
Thus, today, in Hajdieni, Glodeni, the district leadership met 
with the peasants to convince the latter to pay taxes in kind.

  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 8/6/1994 -- The land reform is 
not a panacea for the crisis faced by the Moldovan agriculture, 
stated to the newspaper NEZAVISIMAYA MOLDOVA (Independent 
Moldova), Moldovan Vice Premier Valeriu Bulgari. Bulgari called 
the destruction of the current forms of Agricultural enterprises 
technological regression. Without the necessary agricultural 
equipment and infrastructure, small farms will go bankrupt. He 
also mentioned that advanced technologies need huge investments. 
Businessmen from abroad expect that Moldova will achieve a 
political and economic stability and set taxes at the level of 
the European ones or even lower. Moldova has no choice but to 
cooperate with the ex-Soviet republics and Eastern European 
countries. "By founding the Economic Union (EU), I think that 
all problems will be solved on the basis of the equal rights; 
the EU statute is favorable for Moldova." Bulgari added that 
Moldova has chances to reconquer some of its lost positions on 
the Russian market as the excises on goods from the West, which 
made Moldovan wine uncompetitive, will soon go up because 
Russia, as an EU leader, will intensify the measures of 
protecting its market and producers. The protection of the 
internal markets of the EU member states must constitute a 
large-scale strategy, promoted by all members of this community, 
said Bulgari.

in connection with the underground nuclear test carried out by 
the PRC at Lop-Nor test site on 10 June. It says: Kazakhstan 
is persistent in its policy of banning nuclear tests and signing 
relevant agreements. President Nursultan Nazarbayev addressed 
heads of nuclear states in August 1993 with a proposal to extend 
a moratorium on tests of weapons of mass destruction till the 
year 2005. During his visit in October 1993 to the PRC he held 
talks with the Chinese leadership. He briefed the Chinese 
leadership on Kazakhstan's stance with regard to nuclear tests. 
  Kazakhstan has approved a declaration made by the PRC's 
Foreign Ministry that said China understands concern of 
non-nuclear states regarding nuclear tests. The foreign ministry 
notes that the last test in China was carried out during [words 
indistinct] of moratorium on nuclear tests. The statement says: 
It worries us this test was carried out in the neigboring state 
and might cause serious problems in ecology and (?people's 
health). The Kazakh Foreign Ministry believes it is necessary 
to resume the discussion of the specific proposals by Kazakhstan 
on setting up a joint group of experts on the problems of 
Semipalatinsk and Lop-Nor test sites.

  [Text] Almaty, 9 Jun -- President Nursultan Nazarbayev 
addressed this morning's Supreme Council session. The president 
spoke about of ways of strengthening Kazakhstan's statehood, and 
its domestic and foreign policy for the near and distant future. 
  Touching upon the causes that led to the current situation 
in 
the Republic, which is characterized mainly by negative 
processes and instability, economic crisis, decline in 
production, and growing inflation, the head of state then 
continued to dwell upon the best ways of developing market 
reforms and democratizing society. This path has been 
deliberately chosen by the people. We should focus our 
attention on monetary and credit policy and bank reforms, and 
should take into account the needs of a sovereign state and of 
the market economy. Its main task is to combat the galloping 
inflation and strengthen the national currency. "We should," 
the president said, "strengthen financial discipline both in the 
budget and in the sphere of activities of banks and enterprises. 
Otherwise, it will result in uncontrolled hyperinflation, the 
last [words indistinct]." 
  He thinks that all the country's spending, except for the 
most important, should be cut down--such as allocations for 
paying wages, pensions, and social benefits [words indistinct]. 
Limited credits should be granted only under efficient programs 
and projects. Enterprises operating in the red should be made 
bankrupt in the near future. All benefits with regard to taxes 
and dues should be cancelled. The government should not pay any 
dubious debts and nonpayments of enterprises and banks, and 
minimize spending on maintenance of the state bodies. 
  Along with this [words indistinct] of the major foreign 
investors to participate in reforming the basic branches by 
means of holding international tenders. Prices should be 
released for all types of goods and services, including bread 
prices. The low income families would be paid the difference. 
The Finance Ministry should exercise tough control over the 
revenue and expenditure parts of the budget. Any kind of 
lobbying should be excluded. The National Bank should be freed 
from supervision by the legislative and executive bodies, [word 
indistinct] aimed at stabilizing the tenge. 
  "It will not be easy," the president said, "a great number 
of 
enterprises will come to a standstill, the number of unemployed 
will increase, as well as a number of unhappy people, who will 
call for demonstrations and blame [words indistinct]. We will 
have to withstand all this. There in no turning back." 
  In addition to all these, we will have to address new issues 
in the area of privatization and developing the private sector 
and competition, he said. We should encourage production and 
labor [as received] and create an efficient and powerful 
mechanism for social protection of the population. Legal reform 
should support economic reforms. 
  Of great importance is the creation of [words indistinct], 
the atmosphere of stability in the Republic, and national and 
civil accord. If we do not achieve all this "then we will be on 
the verge of disaster." In connection with this, the head of 
state [words indistinct] "those who are trying to rub people the 
wrong way, disrupt national accord and civil peace, should bear 
responsibility for this in strict compliance with the law of our 
country." He criticized [word indistinct] approach to migration 
processes, which have to be studied and managed so as not loose 
a skilled and active part of the population, and suggested 
adoption of a new law on languages and to abandon discrimination 
of the Russian language. [passage indistinct] 
  Nazarbayev paid a good deal of attention to the issues of 
citizenship. He reminded of the decree that was adopted this 
year in February on making amends to the relevant decree on 
simplifying the procedure for acquiring citizenship and reducing 
the time needed for this. Apart from this, a memorandum on 
citizenship was signed at the end of March during the visit to 
the Russian Federation by the head of our state. Now, "the 
settlement of this issue depends on Kazakhstan and Russian 
parliamentarians," Kazakhstan is unique in terms of the number 
of ethnic groups that are living here. The president said that 
a unique cultural space exists in Kazakhstan -- Russians and 
Kazakhs being the main groups. Therefore, we should pay equal 
attention to the development of the two but, at the same time, 
we should not ignore the others. According to Nazarbayev, we 
can achieve this if only "a legal basis is [words indistinct] 
for the development of culture. We should eradicate race 
discrimination and create equal opportunities for all 
Kazakhstanis." 
  The leader of Kazakhstan urged parliamentarians to adopt a 
package of documents that will take into consideration the 
interests of every ethnic group and national interests. Only by 
doing this can we strengthen and build interethnic accord and 
ensure civil peace. 
  Nazarbayev put forward a number of other proposals aimed at 
achieving consensus between [words indistinct]. Two of them 
exclude each other. "All parties, movements, and mass media 
should reach an accord on strengthening peace, friendship, and 
stability in the Republic, especially at this difficult 
transitional time, and second, to legalize and introduce tough 
sanctions against those who encroach on sociopolitical 
stability, be it citizens, political, public movements, or the 
mass media." According to the president the first one is more 
advantageous. 
  The president also spoke about the Euroasian union, further 
reforms in legal, executive, and juridical branches of power, 
deepening market reforms, cutting inflation, and raising the 
living standards of people. He also spoke in favor of the 
two-chamber parliament that will oust the discredited practice 
of adopting laws. Nazarbayev thinks that it is necessary to 
carry out comprehensive reforms in the Judicial Branch of power 
already this year. In particular, he thinks that it is 
necessary to abandon the division between arbitrate courts and 
[word indistinct], to legalize the principles of unchangeability 
of judges, and to introduce the norms [word indistinct]. 
  With regard to the recent Supreme Council session which 
expressed a vote of no-confidence in the socioeconomic and legal 
policies of the government, the head of state urged 
parliamentarians not to rush [passage indistinct] At the same 
time, we should exercise tough control over its activities, and 
if need be we should render it relevant support and correct its 
mistakes.

  [Text] Alma-Ata [Almaty] 10 June TASS -- The municipal 
council of Leninsk, a satallite town of the Baykonur cosmodrome, 
is concerned over the future of this rocket-launching complex. 
The Kazakh newspaper EKSPRESS-K reports that the council had 
backed the appeal of a group of its members to the Kazakh 
Supreme Soviet, expressing alarmed in connection with the 
absence of a mechanism to implement the Kazakh-Russian agreement 
on the main principles and terms for the use of the cosmodrome. 
  A resolution, adopted in this connection, notes that the 
slowness of the governments of the two countries in implementing 
the achieved agreements places the population of the town in a 
very difficult predicament. The financing of its infrastructure 
was slashed. People were virtually freezing in the production 
premises and in their apartments last winter. The cosmodrome 
facilities could not be used, because this is not allowed during 
very cold periods. 
  The session's resolution was forwarded to corresponding 
committees and commissions of the Kazakh and Russian Parliaments.

  [Text] President Askar Akayev intends to strengthen state 
power in Kyrgyzstan. He said so at Monday's conference with the 
heads of local government bodies. 
  This does not mean a change in the general political course, 
he explained. According to him, some provisions and concepts 
adopted earlier are untenable and illusory, and the real 
developments in the country's political and economic life make 
it necessary to alter objectives. 
  He continues to be in favor of democracy, Akayev pointed 
out, 
but real life has proved that democratic methods are 
ineffective, that they hinder the endeavors to reach tangible 
results on the road to reforms. 
  Under the circumstances a strong state power has no 
alternative, since "The people are not prepared for 
democracy," Akayev stressed. 
  He will resolutely dismiss those people who will hinder the 
implementation of government resolutions or stand in the way of 
carrying out the program for economic restructuring to be 
accomplished in the next three years. 
  On the other hand, Akayev noted that "we could establish an 
authoritarian regime, as other CIS states did, the more so as 
many want it, but this will be unproductive." 
  The passion for parliamentarianism in Kyrgyzstan has led to 
the fact that the Supreme Council engaged in 
politically-motivated criminal investigations, not in normal 
legislative activity, taking up the duties of the national 
security committee, Interior Ministry and courts of justice, 
which scared the potential investors away. 
  "Many people in Kyrgyzstan viewed parliament as the 
apotheosis of democracy," Akayev stressed. "In the meantime the 
activity of the present legislature hinders the country's 
movement on the road of reforms and creates the reputation of a 
scandalous country for Kyrgyzstan."

  [Text] On Saturday [11 June] Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev 
said Kyrgyzstan was doomed to remain a long time yet on the 
sidelines of economic progress. Akayev was speaking at a 
conference at the Slavic University, in Bishkek. 
  In Akayev's view, the republic's geopolitical position did 
it 
little credit. Kyrgyzstan was a land-locked Republic and lacked 
other trade communications. Very soon, he said, the republic 
would depend on its neighbors and especially on Russia because 
economically developed nations felt Central Asia as a whole, 
including Kyrgyzstan, lay in a zone of their interests. 
  But, Akayev said, the Republic's industrial potential failed 
to call for serious foreign investment because Kyrgyzstan was 
unable to save its industrial infrastructure. And that was why, 
he said, the government had to discontinue the production of 
many items. 
  According to Akayev, political instability and the absence 
of 
government guarantees impeded foreign investment in the Kyrgyz 
economy. So, he said, Kyrgyzstan would be unlikely to build up 
its international rating in the next 10 to 15 years.

  [Text] Kirghiz [Kyrgyz] President Askar Akayev said in 
Bishkek that the Russian exodus from Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan] 
spelt catastrophe for both his republic and Russia, which was 
unable to give roof to many thousands of its sons and daughters. 
  Akayev explained the emigration of ethnic Russians from 
Kirghizia by the imperfection of the local economic reform which 
cause a slump in the living standards and overall 
disillusionment. 
  According to Akayev, 918,000 ethnic Russians lived in 
Kirghizia back in 1990. They accounted for 21.2 percent of the 
Republic's overall population. As of 1 April 1994, though, 
there were some 750,000 ethnic Russians in Kirghizia. They made 
up 17 percent of the overall population. In four years, Akayev 
said, 170,000 Russians had left Kirghizia. That inflicted 
irreparable damages on the Kirghiz economy. 
  Akayev agreed that the social and political problems, for 
example the introduction of Kirghiz as the Republic's official 
language, were largely to blame for the wave of emigration. 
And, Akayev said, Russian-speaking entrepreneurs stood little 
chance in Kirghizia, and discrimination against ethnic Russians 
was, indeed, a fact of everyday life.

  [Text] Bishkek 11 June TASS -- Political stability is our 
goal, Peter Carstens, supreme headquarters allied powers [as 
received], Europe told a news conference in the capital of 
Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan] on Saturday [11 June]. The official 
delegation of the North Atlantic Organization headed by him has 
been in Kirghizia for three days. It is the first visit of NATO 
officers to the country after the recent signing by President 
Askar Akayev of the Partnership for Peace programme in Brussels. 
  We are only beginning to establish cooperation with 
Kirghizia, General Carstens said at meetings with President 
Askar Akayev, Defence Minister General Myrzakan Subanov. We 
were looking for points of contact and ways of understanding. 
The first stage of our work is political consultations, 
assistance in training officers. But the principle thing is the 
expanding of security zone, cooperation and the drawing of a 
larger possible number of countries into peace-keeping activity. 
  Although for keeping peace and stability NATO troops are 
ready for combat actions. But, the general stressed, it will be 
done under the aegis of the United Nations organization and with 
the international community's mandate. 
  The Tajikistan problem was touched at the news conference. 
General Carstens maintains this problems is the CIS internal 
affair and states NATO is not planning peace-keeping operations 
in central Asia, nor the setting up of a NATO military base in 
Kirghizia. 
  As to strategic competition with Russia, the NATO chief of 
staff said relations between the North Atlantic Organization and 
the Russian Federation are developing on a positive plane. 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's statement made in 
Istanbul is a manifestation of his country's intention to join 
the NATO Partnership for Peace programme. 
  The NATO delegation saw a military unit and a testing range 
near the capital of Kirghizia and on Monday [13 June] intends to 
leave Bishkek.

  [Text] Moscow 10 June TASS -- As a result of 
round-the-clock joint patrolling of streets in Dushanbe, the 
capital of Tajikistan, by the Republic's security, the Interior 
and Defence Ministry, as well as deployed there Russian military 
contingent units, over 30 firearms were confisticated, military 
sources in Dushanbe told ITAR-TASS today. 
  As reported earlier, with the aim of stabilizing the 
situation in the Tajik capital, a decision was adopted at a 
session of the Coordination Council of the republic's law 
enforcement bodies on 6 June to take additional measures for 
fighting against crimes. The Russian 201 Army Division has set 
up posts, which are being jointly manned with police bodies. A 
mobile radio station is broadcasting the Russian division 
command's appeal to residents of the city to voluntarily 
surrender illegal arms in their possession. Pamphlets carrying 
text of the appeal are being distributed in the capital. The 
patrols have sweeping powers, including carrying out search of 
all types of vehicles, checking documents in possession of the 
citizens and confiscating illegally kept arms. Areas, where 
Russian servicemen and members of their families live, are being 
kept under special guard. 
  It became known today that an attempt was made to attack the 
car of the 201st Divison commander during the evening checking 
of the posts on 7 June. The attacker was disarmed as a result 
of daring decisive action taken by driver Private Salavat 
Galimov. The would-be assassin, identified as Nazar Khoitov, 
born in 1967, was handed over to police.

  [Text] On 20 June the Dushanbe government and opposition 
may be expected to resume negotiations in Tehran and that, 
according to the Commander in chief of Russia's border troops 
Andrey Nikolayev, will likely escalate tension on the 
Tajikistan-Afghanistan border. 
  Practice showed, Nikolayev said, that in the runup to, and 
during, the negotiations the opposition would try to do a bit of 
muscle-flexing and put pressure on Dushanbe. In addition, he 
said, the opposition's negotiating team might fail to control, 
in full measure, the opposition's field commanders. A third 
force could instigate fighting and he who paid, Nikolayev said, 
would want an interest on his investment. 
  Nikolayev withheld his view of the possibility of agreement 
between the opposition and those who were holding power in 
Dushanbe. He said, nonetheless, that agreement was possible if 
both sides came to put the people's interests above their own. 
  Nikolayev admitted that Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan failed to 
meet, in full measure, their pledge to protect Tajikistan's 
external border.

installation construction, while the remainder will be used for 
acquiring medical equipment. 
  Tajik Foreign Minister Rashid Olimov said at a press 
conference that was devoted to the visit by the Indian minister 
and a delegation of Indian entrepreneurs accompanying him, that 
relations between the two countries were entering a new stage. 
The fact that a plenipotentiary ambassador of India to 
Tajikistan would be appointed in Dushanbe in the near future was 
yet more proof of this.

  [Text] Tehran 11 June TASS -- A Turkmen parliamentary 
delegation led by Parliament Speaker Sakhat Muradov arrived in 
Iran on a three-day visit on Saturday [11 June]. 
  Meeting journalists at Tehran's airport upon his arrival, 
Muradov said that Iran and Turkmenistan have "very good" 
relations and called for their development, including between 
the parliaments of the two countries. 
  Iranian Parliament Chairman 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri welcomed 
Muradov's visit as useful for stepping up the implementation of 
previous bilateral agreements. 
  Muradov and Nateq-Nuri will discuss among other things the 
construction of a gas pipeline from Turkmenistan to Europe via 
Iran. The agreement to this effect was reached earlier and 
confirmed by the Iranian and Turkmen presidents during their 
one-day meeting in the Iranian city of Mehrabad in late May.

Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan and Russian 
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev reached a principal agreement on 
establishment of a Russian military base on Armenian territory 
during their talks in Yerevan. 
  Grachev told journalists on Thursday that the base would be 
situated in two cities - Gyumri and Yerevan and would represent 
a potent group of troops, including not only infantry but also 
air defense units, all types of air forces, except for the 
distant ones, and supply units. 
  The group of troops is expected to be so that it could be 
brought to any of threatened directions and to conduct military 
actions for a certain period of time until the main forces come, 
Grachev said. 
  Grachev emphasized that the final decision on establishment 
of the Russian military base would be made by the Russian and 
Armenian presidents. 
  Ter-Petrosyan and Grachev also discussed creation of a 
single 
air defense system for the two countries. Grachev said that 
additional air defense units would be brought to Armenia in 
order to "cover some directions where he can carry out no 
surveillance over the air space." These would be surface-to-air 
missile forces and a squadron of interceptor jets. 
  Grachev pointed out that all these issues were expected to 
be 
resolved in June or July so that the establishment of the 
Russian military base in Armenia be completed in August. 
  In accordance with the achieved agreement, the Armenian 
party 
will take active part in the financing of the Russian military 
base. Grachev stressed that Russian would pay no rent for this 
base. He added that establishment of Russian military bases on 
Armenian and Georgian territory would be carried out according 
to the will of the leadership of these republics. 
  Reliable sources told Interfax that the Russian party had 
proposed that it lease the newly established base during 25 
years with further extension of this term on the basis of an 
agreement between Moscow and Yerevan. 
  Armenian Defense Minister Serzh Sarkisyan believes that the 
Armenian parliament will ratify the Russian-Armenian inter- 
governmental agreement on the status of Russian troops in the 
republic. IF Note: This agreement was signed in 19992 and 
ratified by the former Russian parliament in February, 1993. 
  Sarkisyan said in an exclusive interview with Interfax that 
the Armenian leadership did not demand Russia to pay for leasing 
the base and for public utilities. He added that Yerevan, in 
its turn, wanted Armenian citizens to receive education in 
Russian military colleges for free. Some Armenian servicemen 
may serve on the Russian military bases which are expected to be 
created in Armenia.

  [Text] Yerevan ("AZG" daily), 06/11/94 -- "We solved the 
problems we were to solve", said Russian Defense Minister, Army 
General Pavel Grachev, summarizing on his visit to Armenia. 
  He left for Tbilisi on Friday. "I am leaving with very high 
mood", declared Grachev. "All military problems we planned, 
found a positive solution and were approved by the Armenian 
President". The problem of creating Russian military bases has 
also been resolved. These will be created by August 1, and 
displaced in Gyumri and Yerevan. 
  "Armenia lives, I saw people smiling", he continued. 
Speaking on his impressions, the Russian General said he was 
amazed by training of internal troops in Armenia, by the 
attitude to his work and by the stance. 
  Armenian Defense Minister Serzh Sargsyan expressed his 
contentment about Pavel Grachev's visit. "This was very 
important and serious visit, and its main results will be 
stationing of Russian military bases in Armenia, improving the 
potential of republican anti-air defense and Russian troops 
displaced here." According to the Minister, Russian troops will 
be reinforced by helicopters and airplanes. 
  Going in details on creating the Russian military bases in 
Armenia Serzh Sargsyan noted, this problem has been completely 
resolved. "There are no unclear points left in the agreement 
about the bases," he said. This agreement will be signed and 
affirmed in summer, "and then we'll start its implementation." 
  Speaking on leasing land for the Russian bases the minister 
said, the Armenian side is ready to resolve these problems in a 
mutually advantageous manner. This can be paid back by training 
Armenian specialists in Russian military higher education 
centers, by providing free communal services to Russian troops 
stationed in Armenia or otherwise, said Serzh Sargsyan. On his 
opinion, Russian military bases will be created in Armenia by 
September 1. Concerning the length of the agreement to be signed 
he said that Armenia would like this agreement to be eternal. 
  In his turn, Russian Ambassador to Armenia Vladimir 
Stupishin 
said, Pavel Grachev's visit to Armenia was an important 
political event, concerning not only military aspects. "This 
visit was very important for improving our alliance with Armenia 
both within the framework of the CIS collective security 
agreement and on bilateral basis," said the Ambassador. 
  According to Russian "Novosti" TV program Grachev visited 
Baku on June 11 and negotiated with the President Geydar Aliyev 
about stationing a radio-location station near Gyanja. 
  Speaking on the TV Russian Defense Minister said, "both 
sides 
are accumulating forces at the borders, and therefore there is 
still a long way before introduction of peace-making forces."

<F P=106> [From the "Special Newscast"--recorded] </F>
  [Excerpts] [Correspondent Seyyat Agbabali] During his brief 
working visit to Turkey, Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev met 
with Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, Prime Minister Tansu 
Ciller, foreign ministers of a number of foreign countries, and 
other officials. Dear listeners, you will see a detailed report 
on this visit later. On our special program we bring to your 
attention Aliyev's news briefing in Istanbul on his visit. 
  [Aliyev] I came to Istanbul, Turkey, for a brief working 
visit at the invitation of the esteemed Suleyman Demirel. I am 
now returning to Baku, Azerbaijan. Meetings of very great 
importance Azerbaijan have taken place here. One reason for my 
arrival here at the invitation of our esteemed friend and 
brother Suleyman Demirel was to hold talks and consultations and 
put forward certain proposals regarding accelerating the 
development of ties between Turkey and Azerbaijan. For this 
purpose, we held detailed and lengthy talks yesterday with the 
Turkish president, esteemed Suleyman Demirel, and we discussed 
all the issues of interest to Turkey and Azerbaijan. 
  Today I met the Turkish prime minister, esteemed Tansu 
Ciller, and the deputy prime minister, esteemed Murat 
Karayalcin. We discussed the development of friendly and 
fraternal ties between Turkey and Azerbaijan and speeding up the 
solution of certain matters. We reached agreement on many 
issues. This was the main purpose of my visit, and as such I am 
very satisfied with my visit here. 
  Of course, during our meetings with esteemed Suleyman 
Demirel, Tansu Ciller, and Murat Karayalcin and during our brief 
meeting with esteemed Hikmet Cetin we also discussed the present 
situation in Azerbaijan, particularly the ongoing war between 
Armenia and Azerbaijan, Armenia's aggression against Azerbaijan, 
and the ways to solve this problem. 
  It is known to the world that the Azerbaijani side, and 
myself personally, favor the peaceful resolution of this 
problem. That is, we favor ending the war, halting the 
fighting, and peacefully resolving this problem. We have put 
forward some proposals in this direction but, regrettably, 
achieved nothing. 
  The Azerbaijani side has very strict conditions for the 
peaceful resolution of this problem, these being: The 
Azerbaijani Republic's territorial integrity and the 
inviolability of its borders must be ensured; Armenian Armed 
Forces must leave the occupied Azerbaijani lands; and the 
refugees, the Azerbaijani citizens, should be returned to their 
homes in these occupied lands. We favor a peaceful solution to 
this problem under these conditions, and to this end we are 
trying to make use of CSCE, of the CSCE's Minsk Group. And of 
course, we are also trying to make use of the good offices of 
the major powers--most of which are members of CSCE--and of the 
UN and the UN Security Council. We have taken various measures 
in this direction. Russia, too, is actively involved in this 
problem. Russia is trying to act as a mediator to peacefully 
resolve this problem; and recently the CSCE Minsk Group and its 
chairman Jan Eliasson has agreed that Russia should have a 
special role in this endeavor. Minsk Group also (?consented) 
that CIS too should get involved in this matter. 
  We are working within these parameters. I met with the 
foreign ministers of a number of Western countries yesterday and 
today. [passage omitted] 
  I think that our contacts were very beneficial and 
important. 
Azerbaijan once again reiterated its position at these meetings, 
and asked these major states, the European states, to take part 
in this process. In turn, the foreign ministers of these 
counties said that they favor the resolution of this problem 
exclusively within the CSCE framework--through the Minsk 
Group--and told me that they will be more active in this 
direction in the future. [passage omitted] 
  [Agbabali] Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev was seen off 
at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport by Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister 
Murat Karayalcin, Istanbul Governor Hayri Kozakcioglu, and other 
officials. 
  Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev was welcomed at Baku's 
Bina Airport by the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet Rasul 
Guliyev, Prime Minister Suret Guseynov, and other officials.

  [Text] Baku, 11 Jun -- Talks between the Azerbaijani 
President Geydar Aliyev and Russian Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev are being held here today with the participation of 
experts on both sides. 
  In a press statement Aliyev stressed the importance of the 
meeting and noted in particular the friendly character of 
relations between the two neighboring states. Of late, he said, 
many steps have been taken to successfully develop and 
strengthen these relations. Nevertheless, a broadening of 
cooperation in Aliyev's view requires closer contacts, including 
closer military contacts. The interests of strengthening the 
security of both Azerbaijan and Russia require this. He took 
the opportunity to ask Pavel Grachev to convey the most cordial 
greetings to Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the Russian 
people on their Independence Day and wished them happiness, 
prosperity, and success on the path of building a democratic 
society. 
  Grachev also advocated the organization of multi-faceted 
cooperation between the two countries and raising it to a higher 
level. In this matter, he stated, Azerbaijan will always meet 
with full understanding on Russia's part. The Russian minister 
said that his trip to Azerbaijan was a familiarization and 
working visit. He expressed confidence that the discussion of 
the planned issues would be successful.

Shevtsov and Viktor Shulman] 
  [Text] Baku, 11 Jun -- The Russian Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev has said that his talks today with Geydar Aliyev, the 
president of Azerbaijan, were "successful." Commenting after 
the meeting on its outcome the head of the Russian defense 
department said that the main attention had been focused on two 
purely military matters. 
  The first matter concerned the future of the Gabala 
[Gabelinskaya] missile attack warning station, a large 
installation in northern Azerbaijan that was previously under 
the control of the armed forces of the former Soviet Union. 
Pavel Grachev said that on this matter he had met with full 
understanding on the part of Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev 
that this station is of strategic importance not only for Russia 
and Azerbaijan but also for other CIS countries and the states 
of the whole world. Grachev stated that experts have been given 
the task of studying this matter very quickly so that an 
agreement can be signed on the operation of the installation. 
  The Russian delegation also put forward for consideration by 
the Azerbaijani side a proposal to create a single air defense 
system in the Transcaucasus. This proposal had been discussed 
earlier at talks between Armenia and Georgia, and had been 
accepted by those countries. The head of the Russian defense 
department said that Geydar Aliyev welcomed the idea, and had 
instructed the Azerbaijani defense minister to look into this 
question. Grachev said he hoped for a positive solution. In 
any case, even if Azerbaijan does not give us a positive answer, 
we will build a single air defense system in the Transcaucasus, 
with the participation of Russia, Armenia, and Georgia, -- the 
Russian minister underlined. 
  Speaking of the settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani 
conflict, Grachev said that he had learned a lot in a one-to-one 
conversation with Geydar Aliyev. The Russian minister said he 
would brief in detail President Yeltsin on his return to Moscow. 
Grachev said he had learned two important things from this 
conversation. The first one relates to the influence of the 
internal political situation in Azerbaijan on the conflict 
there. The second, according to the minister, is that no narrow 
or departmental agreement on the cease- fire and on stopping the 
military action would have a positive effect until a 
comprehensive political treaty between Russia, Azerbaijan, and 
Armenia on settling this problem has been signed. Such a 
document is now being developed by the Foreign Ministry and 
other departments, he said, speaking of this issue. 
  At present, Azerbaijan and Armenia on the whole are 
observing 
the cease-fire agreement, Grachev said. However, according to 
his information, each of the sides was building up its forces 
and this could lead to a resumption of military actions. At the 
same time, the minister gave assurances that Russia, as 
mediator, was monitoring the situation in the conflict zone. 
  Grachev said that the question of introducing Russian 
peacekeeping forces into the region had not been discussed at 
the meeting. 
  It has become known that the Russian defense minister and 
those accompanying him will return to Moscow this evening.

  [Text] Baku, June 11 (TURAN) -- Today Azerbaijan President 
Geydar Aliyev has met Russia Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, who 
is in Baku at Aliyev's invitation. Geydar Aliyev noted that 
"such meeting is necessary because Azerbaijan and Russia are 
neighbours and friendly countries". He noted that in order to 
make the cooperation more successful both countries need further 
contacts "including military contacts for strengthening Russia's 
and Azerbaijan's security". 
  The President noted that the question about the biggest 
military object in Transcaucasia -- Gabala radio-location 
station situated in Azerbaijan remains unsolved. "The station 
belongs to Azerbaijan and we should discuss the terms of its 
usage by Russia", said Aliyev. He noted that there are some 
other issues of military character to be solved. 
  Pavel Grachev said that according to the agreement the 
commandant of Russia's anti-aircraft defense forces 
Colonel-General Prudnikov and the commandant of Azerbaijan 
anti-aircraft defense forces Colonel Mamedov will leave for 
Gabala. On their return they will brief the specialists of both 
sides in order to carry out common decision on the usage of the 
object. 
  "Despite some difficulties in our relations the situation is 
going to be change. We want that our military relations with 
Azerbaijan be closer", said Grachev. 
  Then the meeting was held behind the closed door. As TURAN 
was told by the informed people accompanying Aliyev, Pavel 
Grachev proposed Azerbaijan to sign Moscow Protocol from May 17 
about the deployment Russia's peacemaking troops into the 
Armenian-Azeri conflict zone as soon as possible. According to 
Grachev sending of the troops to the zone of military actions 
will take place in 2 or 3 days after signing the Protocol. 
  Concerning the Gabala radio-location station Grachev said 
that Russia would like to use this object free of charge. At 
the same time he proposed Azerbaijan to enter the unique 
anti-aircraft defense system with Russia. He motivated this 
proposal by the fact that both countries are the members of the 
Agreement for joint security of CIS countries.

  [Text] Baku June 11 TASS -- Russian Defence Minister Pavel 
Grachev ended his talks with Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev 
on Saturday and left for Moscow. 
  Grachev described his talks with Aliyev as "successful." The 
discussion focused on two military issues -- the future of the 
Gabelinskaya missile attack warning station in northern 
Azerbaijan and the establishment of a united air-defence system 
in the Trans- Caucasus. 
  The sides agreed that the station is of strategic importance 
not only for Russia and Azerbaijan, but also for other CIS 
states and foreign countries. Experts have been ordered to 
discuss the question and work out an agreement for signing. 
  Grachev also called for establishing a common air-defence 
system in the region. Earlier the idea was supported by Armenia 
and Georgia. Grachev expressed the hope that Azerbaijan will 
give a positive answer, adding that if it agrees otherwise, 
Russia will proceed with building the system in cooperation with 
Armenia and Georgia. 
  Speaking about the settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani 
conflict, Grachev said that he learnt many new things about it 
from Aliyev, particularly about the impact of the political 
situation in Azerbaijan on the conflict and that no cease-fire 
deal can stop the conflict unless a comprehensive political 
agreement is signed between Russia, Azerbaijan and Armenia on 
conflict settlement. 
  The minister said he will inform President Boris Yeltsin 
about the talks, adding that such a document is now being 
considered by the Russian Foreign Ministry and other concerned 
agencies. 
  Azerbaijan and Armenia have been observing the cease-fire on 
the whole, Grachev said. However, according to available 
information both sides are building up strength in preparations 
for a new wave of hostilities. At the same time, he noted that 
Russia as a mediator controls the situation in the region. 
  He said the deployment of Russian peace-keeping troops in 
the 
region was not discussed at the talks. 
  During his June 8-11 tour, Grachev also visited Armenia, 
Georgia and Abkhazia.

Helen Agapova, Russian Defense Minister's assistant for public 
relations, that Russia does not plan to set up military bases at 
Azerbaijan's territory. According to Agapova, Russia does not 
intend to obtain the status of military base to Gabala 
radio-location station as well. "It is a separate 
radio-technical unit which we want to use ourselves without 
Azerbaijan and free of charge. But we need Azerbaijan's 
agreement for that", she said.

<F P=106> ["General Ivanov: Russia Believes that International </F>
Forces' Participation in the Settlement of Armenian-Azeri 
Conflict Will Be Not Effective"--TURAN headline] 
  [Text] Baku, June 11 (TURAN) -- Gennadiy Ivanov, the Pavel 
Grachev's advisor for military and political problems told 
journalists that Russia is ready to send to the conflict zone as 
many troops as it will be necessary. He noted that 1800 
military soldiers for this purpose will not be enough. 
  According to Ivanov, Azerbaijan Defense Minister will leave 
for Moscow in a few days with relevant authorities to sign the 
Moscow Protocol from May 17. The protocol provides the 
deployment of Russian military forces into the conflict zone. 
  Answering the question of NATO's possible participation in 
the peacemaking process Ivanov said that Russia follows 
directions of an Agreement for Joint Security (AJS) of CIS 
countries and has enough forces to separate the warring parties 
in Karabakh. According to Ivanov the possibility of Ukraine's 
participation in peacemaking process is limited "because Kiev 
had not signed the AJS and military facilities of other CIS 
members". 
  Ivanov noted that two weeks ago, addressing in Brussels, 
Pavel Grachev noted that AJS remains priorial [as received] for 
Russia as a nonbloc document which permits to act not 
contradicting to NATO's interests. "Republics of former USSR 
have to join and our interests should be common. The occupation 
of the territory of one member of CIS by another member Ivanov 
called "misunderstanding". [quotation marks as received]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Seyyad Aghababaly] </F>
  [Text] Oil and oil products are important strategic 
commodities. Naturally, the countries that have rich oil 
resources attract the world's attention. The question of oil is 
a matter that concerns the entire world. In fact, a struggle is 
waged on oil in the international arena. Oil and oil products 
are imported by many countries. That creates an opportunity for 
the oil-producing countries to establish their economic 
balances. Meanwhile, a struggle is waged among the influential 
countries and companies to influence the oil-producing 
countries. The matter is better understood if their relations 
with the Arab states and the war between Iraq and Kuwait, not to 
mention the interests that were behind that crisis, are 
considered in depth. 
  Regarding our Republic's resources, Azerbaijan is not among 
the leading oil-producing countries in the world. However, its 
capability of producing an annual 40 million tonnes of oil is an 
important factor. The special quality of Azerbaijan's oil is 
also important. The experts have a better idea on that matter. 
  It is common knowledge that Azerbaijan declared its 
independence after the collapse of the former Soviet Union. A 
state of war has existed in the Republic during the past six 
years. The loss Azerbaijan has suffered totals billions of 
dollars. Undoubtedly, the enemies of our Republic have been 
dissatisfied with President Geydar Aliyev's consistent policy 
and the statement he made some time ago that nothing can force 
Azerbaijan to abandon its independence. Consequently, 
Azerbaijan must benefit from its natural resources with each and 
every opportunity. 
  It must be noted that several oil companies, such as the 
British Petroleum Company, Statoil Company, and Amoco, which are 
among the largest Western companies in the world, are interested 
in establishing bilateral relations with Azerbaijan and 
investing in our country's oil industry. Undoubtedly, the large 
oil companies and the countries they represent, which intend to 
inject billions of dollars into our economy, want peace and 
stability to be established in Azerbaijan. Within that 
framework, the large oil companies may also benefit from the 
political and economic strength of their respective countries. 
Azerbaijan can benefit from that in the political, economic, 
and other fields. 
  President Geydar Aliyev received the leading officials of 
the 
British Petroleum Company and the Statoil Company in Britain in 
February. He supported the signing of an agreement for a 
consortium, which will invest $7 billion on the basis of mutual 
benefits. Aliyev also agreed that the participation of the 
Pennzoil Company, Amoco, Statoil Company, McDermont Company, 
Remco Company, and Turkish Oil Company in the consortium will be 
appropriate. In addition to the $7 billion, a capital of 
$500,000 can be invested with favorable conditions for 
Azerbaijan. The benefit all that may create for our Republic 
will total $118 billion in 30 years. Obviously, real 
opportunities exist to remove the crisis in Azerbaijan's 
economy. With a view to realize those opportunities, the 
Azerbaijan State Oil Company is holding talks with the Western 
oil companies in Istanbul on the joint exploitation of the 
Republic's oil resources. 
  Regarding the status of the Caspian Sea and Russia's 
participation in the exploitation of the oil resources in that 
sea, the participation of Russia's Lukov Oil Company in the 
consortium has been considered. Regarding the exploitation of 
the Azer and Chirag oil fields, those resources are independent 
and Azerbaijan's wealth and no country can have a claim on them, 
including the Russian Federation. 
  It will be recalled that the Russian minister of fuel and 
energy signed the intergovernmental agreement that confirmed 
that the said oil resources belong only to Azerbaijan. The 
agreement was signed during his recent visit to our Republic. 
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has disclosed 
that Russia has not planned to reconsider any matter related to 
the Caspian Sea's status. Therefore, it can be assumed that our 
Republic's oil resources, including the Azer and Chirag oil 
fields, belong only to Azerbaijan and that matters related to 
them can be resolved only within the framework of our Republic's 
jurisdiction.

  [Excerpts] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, who is 
paying a working visit to the Transcaucasus republics, arrived 
from Yerevan in Tbilisi today. [passage omitted] 
  Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and Eduard 
Shevardnadze, the chairman of the Georgian Supreme Council and 
head of state, held a one-to-one meeting at the Georgian Cabinet 
of Ministers, and were later joined by representatives of the 
Russian and Georgian sides. 
  The meeting discussed issues relating to the settlement of 
the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict, in particular, the timing and 
mechanism for the deployment of CIS peacekeeping forces in the 
conflict zone. The sides also discussed terms and conditions for 
the operation of the Russian military bases on Georgian 
territory. 
  Eduard Shevardnadze said that the meeting could be regarded 
as a new stage in relations between Russia and Georgia. It will 
help implement the plan that envisaged the introduction to the 
conflict area of CIS peacekeeping forces under UN aegis [as 
heard] and the repatriation of refugees and displaced persons. 
  In the second part of the day, the Russian defense minister 
flew to Gudauta to agree the introduction of peacekeeping forces 
to the conflict zone with the Abkhaz side. 
  Before leaving for Gudauta, Pavel Grachev said that the 
military aspect of the deployment of Russian peacekeeping forces 
in Abkhazia had in effect been completely solved. As regards 
the timing of their deployment, that could only be decided at 
political level. 
  The minister said that three motor rifle battalions from the 
Leningrad, Volga, and Urals Military Districts were ready to 
carry out the peace operation as part of a CIS force. Three 
days were needed to transfer them to the conflict zone. Pavel 
Grachev also said that the Gudauta-based 345th Parachute 
Regiment of the Russian Armed Forces might take part in the 
disengagement of forces. In addition to that, said the 
minister, it should not be ruled out that three battalions from 
the Group of Russian Troops in the Transcaucasus might also 
participate in the peace mission in the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict 
zone. The group commander has already been issued with relevant 
instructions. 
  It is expected that the Russian defense minister will return 
to Tbilisi later today to continue the discussion of the details 
of the deployment of CIS peacekeeping forces in Abkhazia.

  [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev proposed to 
Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze that the peacekeeping 
operation in the zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict be 
started in five or six days, a participant in the talks between 
Shevardnadze and Grachev in Tbilisi on Friday told Interfax. 
The same source said that Shevardnadze had agreed. 
  During its first stage the peacekeeping operation is 
expected 
to be implemented by the 345th landing regiment, stationed in 
Gudauta (Abkhazia). After the Russian Federation Council adopts 
a decision on the introduction of Russian peacekeepers to the 
zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict, three more battalions 
formed on the basis of the Russian divisions stationed in the 
Leningrad and Privolzhskiy military districts, will be brought 
to the region. 
  Today Grachev arrived in Gudauta where he is now having a 
meeting with Abkhazian leader Vladislav Ardzinba. Grachev 
intends to discuss the peacekeeping operation in the zone of the 
Georgian- Abkhazian conflict and the issue on the presence of 
the 345th landing regiment in Abkhazia, Interfax learned from 
sources close to the Russian defense minister. 
  An Interfax correspondent in Abkhazia said that Commander of 
the Russian Airborne Troops, Colonel-General Yevgeniy Podkolzin 
had earlier arrived in Gudauta. 
  About 1,500 Russian "blue helmets" are expected to be 
brought 
to the zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Albert Kochetkov and </F>
Mikhail Shevtsov] 
  [Text] Tbilisi, June 10 (TASS) -- Russian Defense Minister 
Pavel Grachev's mission on the settlement of the 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict has been a success. After holding 
talks this morning with Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze and 
receiving his consent for Russia to begin a peacekeeping 
operation in Abkhazia, the minister left for Gudauta where he 
met with Vladislav Ardzinba and achieved the same result. 
  Taking part in the talks in Gudauta along with the Defense 
Minister Pavel Grachev were Ambassador of the Russian Federation 
to Georgia Vladimir Semskiy and Commander of Airborne Troops of 
the Russian Defense Ministry Colonel-General Gennadiy Podkolzin. 
  A final decision on the beginning of a peacekeeping 
operation 
will depend on the upper house of the Russian parliament. The 
defense minister expressed the hope that a session of the 
federation council scheduled for June 14 would approve Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin's decree on the participation of Russian 
peacekeepers in the settlement of the Georgian-Abkhazian 
conflict. 
  According to the defense minister, a peacekeeping operation 
in Abkhazia will begin three-five days after a political 
decision is adopted. He expressed the hope that along with 
Russia other Commonwealth countries would take part in the 
operation, particularly states - parties to the treaty on 
collective security. 
  In accordance with the worked out plan of the operation in 
Abkhazia, the defense minister explained, the first to start it 
will be units of the 345th Airborne Regiment stationed in 
Gudauta, as well as three battalions from the group of Russian 
troops in Transcaucasian region. The order on their formation 
has been already given. 
  In the future, Pavel Grachev noted, it is planned to bring 
into the zone of disengagement along the Inguri river the main 
forces -- three battalions formed on the basis of peacekeeping 
divisions from the Leningrad and Privolzhskiy military 
districts. The personnel and materiel will be delivered by 
military transport aircraft to airports in Sukhumi and Gudauta. 
  On his return from Gudauta tonight, Pavel Grachev told 
journalists that a final calculation of all aspects of the 
peacekeeping operation and all means and forces to be involved 
in it would be made during this night. It is exactly with this 
aim that from the Tbilisi airport he set for the headquarters of 
the group of Russian troops in the Transcaucasian region where 
all details of the oncoming beginning of the peacekeeping 
operation will be discussed, according to informed sources from 
the government circles in Tbilisi.

  [Text] Tbilisi, 11 Jun -- Russia's Defense Minister Pavel

  [Text] Tbilisi, 12 Jun -- "For all friendly states the Day 
of Russia's Independence will be a symbol of the new Russia's 
democratic aspirations," Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze, 
the speaker of the Georgian parliament, has told ITAR-TASS. 
  In the opinion of the Georgian leader, Russia is celebrating 
its Independence Day in new and different circumstances. 
Despite the fact that Russia is going through a difficult 
period of establishing itself economically and politically, a 
new social climate is forming in society. 
  "It is vital for all world countries that this country, 
which 
plays the decisive role in whether the post-Soviet region will 
become a conflict-free zone, remains stable," he noted. "If one 
is to speak about Russia's new role in history, it is the 
mission of peacemaker and guarantor of stability."

  [Text] Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian head of state, 
sent a message of greetings to Russian Federation Boris Yeltsin. 
The message says: 
  Highly esteemed Boris Nikolayevich, 
  I am sincerely pleased to have the opportunity of conveying 
to you and all citizens of Russia the warmest greetings from the 
Georgian people and me personally in connection with the 
establishment of a new remarkable tradition to celebrate the 
statehood of a new Russia. In accordance with your edict, the 
day of the declaration of the Russian Federation's sovereignty 
has been declared a public holiday. I am confident that for all 
states that are Russia's friends this day will become a symbol 
of the new Russia's democratic aspirations. 
  I would like to take the opportunity provided by this 
festive 
occasion to stress once again the special importance that 
Georgia attaches to relations with Russia. This was fully 
reflected by the (?comprehensive) treaty signed in Tbilisi. 
  Esteemed Boris Nikolayevich, we value highly the effort put 
forth by Russian diplomacy and you personally aimed at achieving 
a speedy settlement of conflicts on the territory of Georgia. 
The Russian leadership has more than once reaffirmed its 
commitment to the territorial integrity of the Georgian state 
and the inviolability of its borders. We are convinced that 
future talks between our countries will contribute to the 
development of dynamic and purposeful relations. 
  It is natural that relations between our countries exceed 
the 
limits of bilateral relations. As regards Russia's special role 
in history, today it is primarily that of a guarantor of peace 
and stability. 
  I sincerely wish every citizen of Russia well-being, 
happiness, and prosperity. 
  [Signed] Eduard Shevardnadze.

Shevtsov] 
  [Text] Tbilisi June 10 TASS -- Georgia is ready to accept 
Russia's proposals to build its military bases on the Georgian 
territory but with certain reservations, vice-premier of the 
republic, Tamaz Nadareishvili, who is in charge of military 
construction, told ITAR-TASS today. 
  He made this statement in connection with the Russian 
defense 
minister's working visit to Georgia whose program includes not 
only specifying the terms and the mechanism for bringing Russian 
peacekeeping forces to Abkhazia, but also the continuation of 
the talks about stationing military bases on the territory of 
the republic instead of the present group of Russian troops in 
the Transcaucasian region. 
  According to Tamaz Nadareishvili, Georgia should have 
switched over to stationing Russian armed troops on its 
territory in military bases. 
  "But I have some counter-arguments in this question. After 
studying the materials of the previous Russian-Georgian talks on 
this issue, I cannot agree that the draft agreement determines 
only three Russian military bases -- in Vaziani, Batumi and 
Akhalkalaki. In addition, the draft agreement should include 
such large places of disposition of Russian military units as 
Gudauta and Ochamchira. The Gudauta base should be leading on 
the list of the supposed Russian military bases because it is 
the largest one and its geographic position is extremely 
important for Georgia. I am also puzzled why the Gudauta 
military base is taken out of control by the group of Russian 
troops in the Transcaucasian region as if Gudauta were not 
situated on the Georgian territory," Vice-Premier Tamaz 
Nadareishvili pointed out.

  [Text] Eduard Shevardnadze, the head of state and commander 
in chief of the Armed Forces, issued an edict introducing a 
number of changes in the organization and structure of the 
Georgian Defense Ministry. 
  The edict says that changes are needed due to the fact that 
the special purpose, rapid reaction and "mobile" units, which 
were set up in the past as part of the country's Armed Forces 
and were mainly staffed with volunteers, are at present having a 
negative effect on the process of creating regular units in the 
Georgian national army. According to the edict, the 
above-mentioned units are to be incorporated into motor rifle 
brigades of the Georgian Armed Forces. 
  The commander in chief's edict abolishes the Military Police 
Directorate on the grounds that it duplicates the duties of the 
republic's law enforcement bodies and fails to meet modern 
requirements. 
  The head of state's edict declares disbanded all military 
formations and groups that are not part of the Armed Forces. It 
says that their personnel and weaponry are to be used to staff 
and equip motor rifle brigades. 
  With the aim of establishing strict military discipline and 
order at Defense Ministry units, the edict orders the setting up 
of commandant's offices and garrisons in all towns and 
settlements where such units are based.

<F P=106> [Text of address by Georgian Head of State Eduard </F>
Shevardnadze; place, date not given -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] The chairman of the Georgian parliament and head of 
state's address to the Georgian Parliament. 
  Along with other complex issues the issue of a fight against 
crime still remains an object of major concern to the 
authorities. Taking into consideration the geography of crime, 
criminal circles, and forms and character of crime, we can admit 
that we are facing a large-scale process of the criminalization 
of the society. To stop this has become a task of paramount 
importance. Reasons creating conditions for crime to grow 
require separate consideration. It must be noted that we cannot 
regard this as a local occurrence but as a matter related to 
processes accompanying the breakdown of state and social 
institutions of one system and the formation of new political 
and social relations. 
  Presently, the authorities have to make all efforts in order 
to secure normal living and working conditions for the people. 
This cannot be achieved without introducing serious changes in 
a fight against crime. In addition, it is necessary to 
implement an adequate legal policy which will primarily be based 
on a well- considered and systematic legislation. 
  In Georgia, like in all post-socialist states, a process of 
establishing a national legislation is under way. Various 
commissions are involved in work. However, the preparation of 
codified laws needs time. It is necessary that the Parliament 
select concrete problems, attach more attention to the forms and 
sorts of crime which have become a matter of extreme danger for 
the community. A struggle against these requires administrative 
and legal regulation. I regard it as a task of major urgency to 
have the following laws drafted and passed: 
  1. (The law) on the fight against terrorism and banditry; 
  2. (The law) on liability for forming illegal armed units 
and participating in those; 
  3. (The law) on the fight against organized crime. 
  4. (The law) on the fight against corruption. 
  5. (The law) on measures to fight business related to 
drugs trafficking. 
  6. (The law) on measures to ensure control and social 
rehabilitation of persons returning from places of confinement. 
  7. (The law) on liability for blocking transport routes. 
  8. (The law) on legal protection of law-enforcement bodies 
and courts of law. 
  9. (The law) on foreign economic activities. 
  In addition, drafting of new criminal, criminal procedure, 
penalty implementation, and administrative infringements codes 
has to be expedited. 
  I would like to inform the parliament that the Cabinet of 
Ministers and the Justice Ministry in particular, appropriate 
structures of law-enforcement bodies, academic offices and 
individual experts have been working hard in order to establish 
a legal basis for fighting crime. They have drafted many laws 
which will be soon ready to be considered in parliament. A few 
have already been submitted. 
  To fight against crime is an urgent requirement of the 
national progress. By failing to protect public tranquillity as 
well as to establish legislative and administrative institutions 
for this, the authorities impede political, economic and 
cultural development. Juridical, executive as well as 
legislative authorities cannot fail to apprehend this regularity.

  [Text] It seems that the people of Rustavi do not see among 
the six candidates for deputy a replacement for Zhiuli Shartava, 
who died in tragic circumstances. The reason for this may be 
the fact that by noon no more than 300 voters had turned up at 
any single polling station, in some of which up to 2,300 people 
are eligible to vote. The Central Electoral Commission still 
has no precise information (?on the turnout) due to the failure 
of telephone lines. 
  Unfortunately, the elections were not trouble-free either. 
For example, polling stations Nos. eight and 27 were closed 
owing to serious violations of the election law there. 
  At about 1800 hours, Rustavi Mayor Soso Areshidze told us by 
telephone that the situation in the city had become tense at 
about noon. At many polling stations there were incidents 
involving the intimidation of voters and Electoral Commission 
members, the disappearance of voters lists, the removal of seals 
from ballot boxes, and other serious violations of the electoral 
law. 
  At about 1900 hours this evening tension grew even further. 
At five stations elections were suspended. Many Electoral 
Commission members and some commission chairmen abandoned their 
polling stations. 
  The Rustavi mayor's office possesses information that an 
unidentified armed formation has entered the city and is acting 
without authorization. It is searching citizens, and there have 
also been incidents involving physical abuse. 
  We have just received information that the elections in 
Rustavi have in effect ended. A number of political parties 
have attempted to wreck the elections but they were, 
nevertheless, held against the background of a low turnout. The 
results are now being counted. 
  We will have more on the elections in our later bulletins 
today.

  [Text] A by-election was held in Rustavi yesterday. Last 
night, speaking on Georgian TV, Besik Jalaghania, chairman of 
the Rustavi Electoral Commission, said the elections went 
smoothly and without hindrance until noon. At that time armed 
units appeared in town, who, according to Jalaghania, tried to 
exert pressure on voters and members of the Electoral 
Commission. It became impossible to continue the voting 
procedure in some polling stations. 
  According to Jalaghania members of the Mkhedrioni 
[paramilitary units united under the Georgian Rescue Corps] were 
among those causing the destabilization. The Mkhedrioni press 
center circulated a report that the organization had nothing in 
common with any of the candidates. Therefore, the small units 
acting in Rustavi yesterday did it on their own initiative. 
  Jalaghania also said that because of the disturbances he had 
to quit the elections and get away from Rustavi. He thinks that 
the by-election in Rustavi may be considered void.

  [Text] Tallinn, June 10, BNS -- The NATO foreign ministers 
meeting in Istanbul, Turkey, yesterday adopted a final 
communique which among other issues welcomed the recent 
agreement to complete the withdrawal of Russian troops from 
Latvia by Aug. 31, 1994. 
  The communique called on Estonia and Russia to resolve the 
remaining issues by negotiation and conclude soon an agreement 
on the withdrawal of foreign troops remaining in the Baltic 
nation by the same date. 
  The NATO foreign ministers underscored in the final 
communique that good cooperative relations between NATO and 
Russia will be the key element for security and stability in 
Europe. The document also expressed full support for the Pact 
on Stability in Europe, known as the Balladur Plan, which aims 
to solve questions related to frontiers and ethnic minorities in 
Central and Eastern Europe. 
  The communique noted that the implementation of NATO's 
Partnership for Peace program is well under way and that the 
first joint military exercises between partners will take place 
this autumn in the Netherlands and in Poland. 
  The NATO foreign ministers met today at a session of the 
North Atlantic Cooperation Council [NACC] in Istanbul with their 
counterparts from Central European states and Russia. The NACC 
was founded in December 1991 as a forum for dialogue and 
cooperation in questions related to politics and security. 
Estonia was one of the founding members. 
  The meeting in Istanbul was addressed by Estonian Foreign 
Minister Juri Luik.

  [Text] Riga, 3 Jun -- Several influential foreign 
financial institutions, banks, and stock exchanges have promised 
to help get Latvia's financial system in order, Minister of 
Finance Uldis Osis reported at a press conference on his return 
from a visit to Germany and Luxembourg. 
  Over a period of three years, a financial system, aimed 
primarily at supporting small business, should be developed in 
Latvia. Therefore, investments in the national economy are 
necessary, which can be acquired from both the state budget 
(approximately 3-4 percent of national product) and foreign 
investments. In addition, in the future it is foreseen to 
refrain from state-guaranteed foreign credits, so that Latvian 
banks or businessmen can borrow money directly from abroad. 
Until now, all foreign credits coming into Latvia were directly 
or indirectly guaranteed by the government. 
  To create conditions enabling representatives of small 
businesses in Latvia to obtain credits with fewer formalities, 
it is necessary, in the first place, to develop and strengthen 
the Bank of Investments, said Osis. As a next step, the 
minister mentioned the formation of credit associations and 
savings banks. In this realm, said Osis, the German Cooperative 
Bank has pledged its assistance. It is also of greatest 
importance to establish an association of credits and 
guarantees, which would be able to provide a guarantee to small 
enterprises receiving credits. Two Finnish companies are 
willing to assist in establishing this kind of association in 
Latvia, Osis reported. According to him, Western experts have 
advised Latvia to consider the possibility of becoming an 
"offshore" financial center.

  [Excerpts] Riga, 3 Jun -- [passage omitted] Finance 
Minister Uldis Osis emphasized at a press conference that 
consultations have been held with representatives of several 
international financial organizations in Latvia who expressed a 
universally negative opinion on any possible increase in import 
tariffs. If tariffs are raised, Latvia will not receive, over 
the next two years, approximately $250 million worth of foreign 
credits. In addition, the granting of a G- 24 credit would be 
canceled. A $90 million credit earmarked by the IMF would be 
tied up, and two credit lines at the World Bank would be 
suspended -- a $50 million credit for agriculture, and $35 
million earmarked for the development of the Latvian Universal 
Credit Bank. [passage omitted] 
  Summarizing the possibilities, an increase in customs 
tariffs 
would mean a complete change in Latvian economic policy, stated 
Osis. Consequently, a move toward protectionism would take 
place and any decent competition would be destroyed by 
supporting ineffective production. 
  The finance minister accused the Latvian delegation to the 
talks with the European Union, concerning a free trade 
agreement, of presenting -- during the course of negotiations -- 
new, higher customs tariffs instead of the present effective 
ones, and deemed it an illegal and wrongful action. "These 
tariffs have not been accepted, either by the government or by 
the parliament's Budget and Finance Committee, therefore the 
delegation had no right to propose such tariffs," stated Osis. 
  The Latvian Finance Ministry, however, does not at all 
intend 
to utterly resign from import customs duties, emphasized Osis. 
The following compromise is being considered -- for 
approximately six agricultural products, tariffs would be raised 
by 50-70 percent over the present amount. The types of products 
would be determined on the bases of the Latvian agricultural 
development program, which has not yet been worked out. After 
choosing these five or six products, which will be decided to be 
beneficial for Latvia, their production will be supported by 
establishing respectively high customs tariffs.

  [Text] Vilnius, June 11, BNS -- Lithuanian Foreign 
Minister Povilas Gylys at a meeting with NATO Assistant 
Secretary General Sergio Balanzino in Istanbul Friday delivered 
Lithuania's set of propositions for activity under the NATO 
Partnership for Peace program, the Foreign Ministry press office 
said. 
  Gylys takes part in Istanbul in a foreign ministers meeting 
of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council [NACC]. 
  The document delivered to the NATO assistant secretary 
general lays the basis for outlining a separate cooperation 
program between Lithuania and NATO under the partnership plan. 
  The Lithuanian foreign minister is his speech before the 
NACC 
meeting pronounced his country's wish that the NATO partnership 
program would take into account the needs of each participating 
country. In his words the Partnership for Peace program allows 
active partners to play a great role in expanding the alliance. 
  Gylys also referred in his speech to the problem of Russian 
military transits to the Kaliningrad enclave through Lithuania's 
territory. He underscored that finding a solution to the issue 
must not be linked to carrying out the stipulations of the 
Lithuanian- Russian agreements that have been signed earlier.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jun 09, BNS -- The head of the Russian 
delegation for talks with Lithuania confirmed that "Russia links 
the problem of transit and normal functioning of the Kaliningrad 
region to Lithuania's most favored nation trade status." 
  Viktor Isakov noted that "this is not a trap of officials or 
the (Russian) Foreign Ministry," but "the line of the country's 
leadership." 
  In an interview with the Vilnius-based Russian-language ECHO 
LITVY newspaper, Isakov commented on a round of 
Lithuanian-Russian talks that was held in Vilnius June 7-8. 
  Discussing Russian military transit, the Russian diplomat 
said Russia "is not asking anything from Lithuania,...,and does 
not demand to create some uncontrolled corridor." Isakov noted, 
however, that Russia has some things to complain about. In his 
words, "entire tank-cars of fuel disappear during transit 
through Lithuanian territory." The Russian diplomat said 
"explanations that cargos are redirected and even that mafia is 
involved are not convincing." 
  Commenting on accusations that Russia pressurizes Lithuania, 
Isakov said "not a single example of such threats and statements 
was presented by the Lithuanian side. On the contrary, threats 
to "shut in" the Kaliningrad region are already heard from the 
Lithuanian side." In Isakov's view, difficulties in talks on 
sea borders are "completely natural yet possible to overcome." 
  Isakov said assertions that Kaliningrad poses a military 
threat is a fiction, "just another card in the game of those who 
do not want improvement of relations" between Lithuania and 
Russia.

  [Text] Moscow June 10 TASS -- "Russia's idea to hold an 
international conference on the Korean peninsula's security and 
nuclear-free status are meeting with increasing understanding 
and support", Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov 
told ITAR- TASS. The diplomat met North Korean Ambassador to 
Russia Son Sung- pil on Wednesday [8 June], and Chinese 
Ambassador Wang Jinqing -- on Friday. 
  According to the deputy foreign minister, "nobody objects in 
principle" to an international conference, which should be 
attended, in Moscow's opinion, by representatives from North and 
South Korea, Russia, the United States, China, Japan, and also 
the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
  Panov noted that "the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
is now calling much more persistently for such a conference". A 
sufficiently positive assessment of the Russian initiative was 
made by the North Korean Ambassador and somewhat earlier, in 
Kiev, by North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam. "They said 
that they regard our idea with full understanding, because it 
pursues the purpose of achieving a peaceful settlement of the 
problem. They are prepared to study it carefully," Panov stated. 
  According to the deputy foreign minister, "some people 
believe that first it is necessary to impose sanctions on North 
Korea and then to hold such a conference. We believe that this 
is a strange approach. There will most probably be no 
conference if the sanctions are clamped down". 
  Panov recalled that the procedure proposed by Russia was 
determined by President Boris Yeltsin. He believes that "the 
conference should be held first in order to make full use of all 
the available political opportunities, including talks. After 
that North Korea could be warned about the sanctions and then 
subjected to them. However, we think that things will not go to 
such length." 
  "At present," the Russian diplomat said, "we regard the 
conference as the only alternative, because the bilateral talks 
between the United States and the Democratic People's Republic 
of Korea have landed in an impasse". He recalled that Moscow 
"did not object to the bilateral format, but since it has been 
exhausted, we must try to use the international version". "We 
proceed from the premise that it is necessary, first and 
foremost, to try this approach," the deputy foreign minister 
stressed.

  [Text] Russia still insists that before imposing sanctions 
against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea [DPRK], an 
international conference on resolving the nuclear crisis on the 
Korean peninsula should be convened. Russian Vice Foreign 
Minister Panov reiterated this view in a meeting with the 
Chinese ambassador in Moscow on Thursday [9 June]. He had a 
similar talk with the DPRK ambassador earlier. The idea of 
calling an international conference was proposed by President 
Yeltsin, who maintains that North Korea, South Korea, Russia, 
the U.S., Japan, and China should participate in the conference.

  [Text] Moscow June 10 TASS -- Duma factions of communists, 
agrarians and liberal democrats lead by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy 
took a joint stand once again. They issued a joint statement 
"on the situation in the Korean peninsula" which was circulated 
in the lower house of parliament on Friday. 
  These factons noted a sharp aggravation of the situation on 
the Korean peninsula, close to Russian borders. Deputies 
pointed out that "certain circles in the United States want to 
compel the DPRK to accept humiliating terms of the settlement of 
the so-called nuclear problem". In this connection 
representatives of the three above-mentioned Duma factions 
expressed "perplexity" at the statement of the Russian 
leadership which, in the opinion of deputies, "actually sided 
with one party in the conflict, South Korea". 
  The deputies expressed disapproval of Russia's decision to 
join in the economic sanction against the DPRK. "Our national 
interests would be suited by giving up power methods, creating 
conditions for a dialogue between the north and south of Korea 
and implementing the concept of a non-nuclear zone in the Korean 
peninsula", the statement says.

  [Text] North Korea can produce 65 kg of plutonium a year, 
the influential Japanese newspaper YOMIURI writes today quoting 
a statement by a senior CIA official. 
  [Begin G.Kaurov, department head in Russian Atomic Energy 
Ministry, recording] According to IAEA information, North Korea 
is in possession of grams or kilograms of unregistered 
plutonium. But grams or even one or two kilograms of plutonium 
are not enough to develop nuclear weapons, not even a single 
warhead. [end recording] 
  [A.Peslyak] The Ministry's official believes that the 
conflict between Korea and the IAEA [International Atomic Energy 
Agency] started at a level of several grams of plutonium going 
unaccounted for. 
  [Begin Kaurov recording] In Japan 70 kg of unregistered 
plutonium-239 have been discovered, and the IAEA did not follow 
this with some special sanctions, in this case. [end recording] 
  [Peslyak] Although following an agreement concluded in the 
60s, the USSR built a nuclear center near Pyongyang, with a 
research reactor, a chemical lab, and betatron and trained about 
60 specialists. As of 1992, according to Kaurov, nuclear fuel 
deliveries and visits of specialists were suspended. On the 
other hand, according to Kaurov, as recently as 15 year ago U.S. 
journals openly published documents showing the structure of 
nuclear weapons. So it is difficult to say which actions could 
help in creating explosive devices. In order to develop 
weapons, however, Kaurov stressed, such actions are needed which 
would have been discovered by the technical intelligence 
services of many countries. This has not happened. It is 
necessary to ensure that North Korea stays covered by the 
nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty but, according to the 
Ministry's official, one should not get carried away. A 
diplomatic way toward nuclear control, sovereignty and universal 
security should be found.

<F P=106> [Interview with DPRK Ambassador Son Song-pil by Sergey </F>
Turchenko, date and place not given: "Threat of Blockade: Son 
Song-pil, DPRK ambassador to Russia, Talks About the Provocative 
U.S. Policy on the Korean Peninsula"] 
  [Text] The situation on the Korean peninsula has flared up 
again sharply recently. The reason for this is apparently an 
internal matter relating to the DPRK's domestic economic 
activity: The latter has decided to replace some fuel rods at an 
experimental nuclear reactor. IAEA experts were invited in good 
time to monitor this work. Hardly had they had time to begin 
work than people in the United States kicked up what is clearly 
a propaganda fuss about the impossibility of the technical 
inspection of the fuel rods and began voicing a priori 
suspicions that the DPRK is producing plutonium for nuclear 
weapons. And it is on these grounds that the "world policeman" 
is demanding an economic blockade of North Korea and other 
sanctions. What is behind this campaign? We put that question 
to Comrade Son Song-pil, DPRK Ambassador to Russia. 
  [Son Song-pil] I want to stress that we immediately gave the 
IAEA experts all the documentation relating to the method for 
the technical inspection of the fuel rods. The same 
documentation was also sent to the U.S. side. They promised us 
that they would study it. We expressed a readiness for any 
compromise if our method failed to satisfy the specialists in 
any way. However, a calm solution of the question was clearly 
not in the U.S. side's plans. Without waiting for the 
specialists' assessment the politicians mounted a noisy 
propaganda campaign aimed at inclining the United Nations toward 
sanctions against our country. But the main task of the United 
States remains unchanged -- it is to stifle a socialist state in 
Northeast Asia. In this connection we state that if sanctions 
are imposed on us we will take appropriate measures. At the 
same time we state that we will regard the imposition of 
sanctions as a declaration of war against us. At the same time 
we stress that we do not want to aggravate the situation and we 
believe that the nuclear problem can be resolved only on the 
basis of a simultaneous and comprehensive solution of all the 
questions connected with it. 
  [Turchenko] Can you tell us in greater detail what kind of 
documents were handed over to the U.S. side, because for some 
reason the press is saying nothing about them? 
  [Son Song-pil] They contain a technical description of our 
methods of measuring fuel rods. These methods have been 
approved and fully correspond to our technical capabilities. In 
this connection I repeat that we have informed the United States 
of our readiness for compromise options. But we have not 
received any suggestions from the United States. Apart from a 
completely unjustified demand for the inspection of two military 
installations which have nothing to do with the reactor. And 
that, after all, is a flagrant violation of the country's 
sovereignty. We will not agree to such a step. 
  [Turchenko] Can you explain, please, what is meant by the 
simultaneous and comprehensive solution of the problem? 
  [Son Song-pil] The United States is demanding steps only 
from our side right now. We, however, propose that everything 
be resolved as a package. For our part we are ready to ensure 
the possibility of regular and random inspections under [po] 
nuclear guarantees. We are also ready to return to the 
framework of the nuclear weapon nonproliferation treaty, which 
the DPRK suspended in response to the high-handedness of the 
United States toward North Korea. This, so to speak, is our 
contribution to the settlement of the problem. But at the same 
time the Americans must renounce the threat to use nuclear 
weapons against our country. In this context the U.S. nuclear 
weapons and nuclear bases must be evacuated from South Korea. 
The "Team Spirit" military maneuvers directed against us must 
also be terminated. In addition to all this we demand the 
renunciation of the provocative policy toward the DPRK and the 
normalization of relations with our country. That is the U.S. 
contribution to a solution. 
  However, the Americans are demanding that we unilaterally 
accept their jurisdiction and then they will see whether it is 
worth fulfilling our demands. The problem cannot be resolved on 
that basis, which is, to put it mildly, unjust. 
  [Turchenko] You spoke of appropriate measures in response to 
the sanctions. What do you mean? 
  [Son Song-pil] Concrete sanctions will lead to concrete 
measures. It is difficult to make predictions just now. But we 
have stated that if any country takes part in sanctions we will 
view that as a declaration of war with all the consequences that 
such an action entails. 
  [Turchenko] How do you view Russia's proposal to convene an 
international conference on the solution of the Korean problem? 
  [Son Song-pil] A conference is a step toward the solution of 
the problem by peaceful means. Of course, we give the due 
assessment to this proposal. It has special significance also 
because the Americans have stated that it is impossible to 
continue the Korean-U.S. talks. If an international conference 
is held on a fair and equal basis we will support it. 
  [Turchenko] Apart form the general proposal, has the Russian 
side provided any materials which give concrete substance to the 
form and content of the conference? 
  [Son Song-pil] Unfortunately our side has not received any 
such materials to date. I recently had a conversation with 
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Panov. The ideas suggested so 
far relate purely to the framework of this conference. It is 
to be hoped that this question will receive a positive 
development.

<F P=106> [Commentary by correspondent A. Peslyak; from the "Vesti" </F>
newscast--recorded] 
  [Text] [G. Kaurov, head of a department of the Russian 
Ministry of Atomic Energy, identified by caption] Korea is, 
perhaps, capable of developing nuclear weapons now, but we have 
serious doubts that Korea is actually developing nuclear weapons. 
  [Peslyak] So Russian nuclear specialists believe that 
Pyongyang does not have the bomb, while the West and South Korea 
stress in every possible way the reality of the nuclear threat 
in the peninsula. The problem, perhaps, lies elsewhere or not 
only in the dilemma of what course of action to take: Sanctions 
or conferences, pressure or a negotiated compromise? To count 
on inspectors being given access to Pyongyang's nuclear 
installations but in exchange for what? For direct talks with 
the United States? To give appropriate guarantees to North and 
South Koreas, to keep the peninsula nuclear-free? But what 
should be regarded as the cause of the current situation? 
  In the West's view, it is Pyongyang's blackmail and bluff 
plus indirect support from Beijing which has just carried out an 
underground nuclear explosion. But maybe, partially the reason 
is a search for a new image of an enemy after the old one 
represented by Moscow does not exist any longer for the United 
States and NATO? After all, an opportunity has appeared to 
justify nonreduction of military budgets and carry out some 
preparations, referring to somebody's intransigence. 
  One thing is clear: The Treaty on Nuclear Nonproliferation 
expires next year. If, in the international class, one pupil 
suddenly shows an indomitable temper in learning nonnuclear 
peace, will nuclear veterans have enough political tact and 
sensibility to use persuasion instead of arm-twisting? Other 
pupils will then see this as an equality-promoting experience.

  [Text] Istanbul June 10 TASS -- Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev has called on the international community to help 
Russia in its peace-making on territory of the former Soviet 
Union by sending observers and rendering material support at the 
current session of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council. In 
his words, Russia is carrying an increasing peace-making burden 
in former Soviet republics. 
  Closer interaction of the council with European neutral 
states, which are experienced in peace-making, would help to 
increase the collective peace-making potential, said the 
minister. 
  Kozyrev urged the need for closer cooperation of CSCE and 
the 
council in peace-keeping operations as it is envisaged by the 
council's plan for 1994, and suggested to form a corresponding 
joint working group. 
  The Russian concept of European partnership provides for 
coordination of military, political and peace-making interaction 
by the North Atlantic Cooperation Council and the leading role 
of CSCE, Kozyrev told the council's session. In his opinion, 
the council can and must gradually transform into an independent 
body to be based on equality of all participants and not on the 
scheme of "NATO plus partners". 
  Kozyrev called for the involvement of a large number of CSCE 
members in the council activities, permanent contacts between 
the two organizations and the use of the council's abilities in 
the implementation of the Partnership for Peace program. 
  Russia is striving for deepened partnership with NATO 
without 
mutual vetoes and "surprises", Kozyrev told the council. "The 
Partnership for Peace program is starting. We plan to come to 
Brussels to boost a program of deepened cooperation between 
Russia and NATO, including a framework document, as soon as the 
NATO headquarters finalize the preparations," said Kozyrev.

  [Text] Istanbul June 10 TASS -- Russia considers the 
Partnership for Peace program to be an area of European 
cooperation, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said here 
today upon the completion of his meeting with U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher. 
  Kozyrev said he will soon visit Brussels to give a boost to 
the Partnership for Peace framework document and the program of 
Russian- NATO interaction. He said this program should not 
include mutual vetoes and "surprises". 
  The Russian minister voiced the need for the soonest holding 
of the second conference on Bosnia with participation of 
ministers from Russia, the United States and five nations of the 
European Union but stressed the conference should be well 
prepared. He called on the conflicting sides for political 
settlement of their differences and termination of combat 
operations in Bosnia. 
  In his turn, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said 
that his negotiations with Andrey Kozyrev discussed cooperation 
in provision of stability and security around the globe. The 
sides exchanged opinions of bilateral relations and called for 
the development of a constructive dialogue to help settlement of 
regional conflicts and differences.

  [Excerpts] A meeting of the North Atlantic Cooperation 
Council [NACC] at the foreign minister level in Istambul, 
Turkey, summed up the results of NACC's work over the half-year. 
[passage omitted] 
  In a brief interview with Vesti prior to his departure by 
air 
Andrey Kozyrev noted that on the whole we have no fundamental 
differences with NATO. Meanwhile, he said, NATO members do not 
in all ways share the principle of the full equality of NACC 
members, on which we insist. They prefer the formula NATO plus 
partners. In particular this was reflected in the communique on 
the NACC meeting. 
  [Begin recording] [Kozyrev] I could not agree with certain 
formulas, which to my mind take insufficient account of Russia's 
role. For instance, concerning Karabakh, a formula is being 
proposed that notes and stresses only the role of the CSCE. We 
do not demand anything special, but our interests must be taken 
into account. [end recording]

  [Text] Moscow, 11 June -- Russia would like to come to an 
agreement with NATO on forms of partnership before the meeting 
between President Boris Yeltsin and the leaders of the seven 
leading Western states, which is to be held in Naples next 
month. Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said this on 
Friday [10 June] evening. 
  Speaking to journalists on board his plane to Moscow from 
Istanbul, where he had attended a session of the North Atlantic 
Cooperation Council, Kozyrev called on the parties "to finish 
their ideological disputes more quickly and get down to 
business." He had noted sympathy in this regard in his talks 
with U.S. State Secretary Warren Christopher, among others. 
  As President Boris Yeltsin said on Friday, Kozyrev noted, we 
are talking about the signing of a framework document and of the 
NATO- Russia program. Incidentally, the minister added, in the 
communique following the NATO council session, which has just 
taken place, Russia's viewpoint is taken into account. It talks 
about a program that will reflect the Russian Federation's 
specific role and weight. 
  Russia will sign both the framework agreement and a 
substantive and much more thorough program for partnership as 
soon as the documents setting down the relevant agreements are 
ready. This should be done quickly, before the meeting in 
Naples, the minister said. 
  The minister was asked whether it was probable that the 
agreement between Russia and the European Union would be signed 
at the forthcoming meeting of European Union leaders on the 
island of Kerkira (Corfu), in which it is expected Boris Yeltsin 
may take part. "I think that this probability is constantly 
growing," Kozyrev stated. "The remaining matters are technical 
ones connected with the translation of the text of the accords 
into the languages of the countries involved in the agreement." 
According to the head of Russia's diplomacy the possibility of 
completing the necessary preparatory work in a short space of 
time was confirmed too during his conversation in Istanbul with 
Karolos Papoulias, the foreign minister of Greece, which is the 
current chairman of the European Union.

  [Text] Moscow June 10 TASS -- China has staged another 
underground nuclear test despite repeated appeals on the part of 
several states, including Russia, a representative of the 
Russian Foreign Ministry said here today. 
  "This event provokes deep Russian regret, the more so China 
did it at a time of the Geneva multilateral negotiations on 
comprehensive ban on nuclear tests, which has been supported by 
all nuclear powers," says the statement received by ITAR-TASS. 
  "We are also alarmed with the fact further Chinese nuclear 
tests may endanger the observation of the nuclear tests 
moratorium by other nuclear powers. 
  "We would like to hope that the Chinese side will understand 
its genuine national interests, comply with the appeals of the 
international community and together with other nations help to 
achieve complete termination of underground nuclear tests and 
fulfilment of the Chinese-declared intention to conclude a 
treaty on comprehensive ban on nuclear tests," says the document.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Baturin, Russian presidential aide on </F>
national security, by announcer Sergey Medvedev; from the 
"Novosti" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Medvedev] Yuriy Mikhaylovich, this week the State 
Duma did not after all agree to allocate 55 billion [currency 
not specified] to defense needs and military theoreticians and 
military leaders are saying that the lack of nearly 15 billion 
does not allow them to either buy in new equipment or even 
repair ships. If that is the case, will this hit the our 
country's national security interests? 
  [Baturin] Here, the level of the budget that is now set is 
the minimum and maybe even less than the minimum, and the main 
danger for the defense capacity lies in the question: Are we 
able to maintain our high technology, our high technology 
production? In other words, those things in which we are for 
the moment ahead of other countries. If we lose these, then the 
damage to the defense capacity will be irreparable. 
  [Medvedev] The Security Council was due to meet this week. 
What happened, Yuriy Mikhaylovich? Why did the meeting not take 
place? 
  [Baturin] Nothing out of the ordinary took place. It is just 
that three members of the Security Council were out of Moscow 
and were unable to attend this meeting. Boris Nikolayevich 
Yeltsin, as leader of the Security Council, postponed the 
meeting to another day. 
  [Medvedev] What was the theme for the cancelled meeting? 
  [Baturin] The issue of Russia's borders and, in particular, 
state border policy, the tasks of which were laid down by the 
president at the meeting at the high command of the border 
troops on 27 May. 
  [Medvedev] About the borders, more and more often we have 
seen them being violated. I do not mean just in those parts of 
the border where things are hot. Take for instance the recent 
incident with the American Lockheed. We still do not know what 
it was carrying on board. 
  [Baturin] I should tell you that the incident with the 
Lockheed 130 ended without any particular losses materially or 
in terms of status on both sides. But here, of course, we can 
see a symptom of the lowering of the general level of security, 
which is linked to the lowering of Russia's authority, something 
our country can hardly be pleased about. In point of fact, for 
a long time now the Russian air force has not flown to the 
shores of the United States and has respected state borders. 
The opposite, as you see, is taking place. This sort of 
inequality does not help to reinforce the trust between our 
countries of which we have so much need.

the U.S. House of Representatives to lift the arms embargo 
against Bosnia, the committee's chairman Vladimir Lukin said 
today. 
  He told a news conference in Moscow that the decision made 
by 
U.S. parliamentarians could have a negative impact on the 
Bosnian talks. 
  Lukin said he intended to propose that representatives of 
the 
U.S. and Russian parliamentary committees on international 
affairs meet in order to discuss the situation. 
  However, next week the State Duma will consider at the 
second 
reading the draft law on the unilateral lifting of sanctions 
against the rump Yugoslavia by Russia.

Russian State Duma has expressed concern over the adoption by 
the House of Representatives of the U.S. Congress of a 
resolution in favor of the unilateral lifting of embargo on arms 
supplies to Bosnian Muslims. 
  The statement adopted by the lower chamber of the Russian 
parliament notes that such a measure would lead to an escalation 
of conflict in southern Yugoslavia [as heard] and undermine the 
current peace process. In this situation the committee sees it 
as its obligation to reaffirm a recommendation to the president 
and the government of the Russian Federation to study the 
question of taking practical measures to lift unjustified 
sanctions imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Their Dollars for Our Environment"] </F>
  [Text] The World Bank has made a decision to grant Russia 
a loan of $110 million to implement a series of nature 
conservation projects. The World Bank is providing $45 million 
of that amount on a nonreturnable basis. 
  This credit issue is the result of more than two years of 
negotiations with the Bank in which the Russian Ministry of the 
Environment and Natural Resources played the main role. 
  In connection with the bank's decision, Viktor 
Danilov-Danilyan, the head of the ministry concerned, believes 
that the loan will help to attract Western investors to 
environmental projects which are being carried out on Russia's 
territory. The minister said that it is planned to implement 
these projects in the most environmentally disadvantaged areas 
of the country and in particular the Lake Baykal region and Tula 
and Kemerovo oblasts. There is also a plan to create the 
necessary infrastructure of Russian nature conservancy organs. 
  The Ministry of the Environment has also announced that the 
Danish Environmental Protection Fund has made Russia a gift of 
$3 million for filter equipment for the Northern Thermal 
Electric Power Station in Moscow. The introduction of these 
devices will help to reduce discharges of nitric oxide from 5.5 
tonnes to 1.8 tonnes a year and to subsequently close down 
several dozen boilers operating on obsolete technology.

  [Text] Moscow June 11 TASS -- The speakers of the Russian 
Parliament upper chamber and the Armenian Parliament specified 
some items for their cooperation at their meeting at the upper 
chamber on Saturday. 
  Telling this to journalists, Russian Speaker Vladimir 
Shumeyko noted that a cooperation agreement between the two 
chambers of the Russian Parliament and the Armenian Parliament 
was signed on Friday. 
  The two speakers agreed that it is necessary to establish 
inter- committee parliamentary relations and develop their 
contacts while drafting legislative acts in order to boost ties. 
  Armenian Speaker Babken Ararktsyan stressed: "We highly 
assess relations in the framework of the inter-parliamentary 
assembly and claim at the same time that bilateral parliamentary 
contacts should be also developed". 
  The sides discussed problems connected with Nagorno-Karabakh 
at the meeting. Noting that the Bishkek protocol is still in 
force, Shumeyko stressed that the meetings of parliament 
speakers in St. Petersburg and Moscow "plotted a good road for 
the negotiating process to settle the Armenian-Azeri conflict 
with the participation of the third party -- the 
Nagorno-Karabakh parliament". 
  The Armenian speaker invited Shumeyko to visit his country.

  [Text] The head of the Armenian parliament, Babken 
Ararktsyan, who is visiting Moscow, said he supported Russia's 
plan for the settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. 
In Ararktsyan's words, the position taken by Armenia fully 
coincides with the Russian position. Its main points are a 
cease-fire in the conflict zone, the disengagement of the 
warring sides and the introduction of the CIS peacekeeping 
forces into the buffer zone. These measures are designed to 
create conditions for resolving the status of Nagorno-Karabakh.

"Russian Defense Minister's Trip to Transcaucasus Another Step 
Toward Establishing Peace in This `Warring Region'"] 
  [Text] Commenting on the first results of the trip to the 
Transcaucasus by Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian Federation 
Defense Minister, which began 8 June, observers are stating that 
Russia's military department, particularly of late, is 
increasingly having to tackle not just purely military problems 
but also political ones. Sometimes this is dictated by the 
nature of the situation which has developed on the territory of 
the former USSR and Russia's commitments as its successor, and 
also, as far as can be surmised, by a definite division of 
functions directly within the military structures. Moreover, 
the experience of the Russian Federation Defense Ministry's 
previous contacts both with the leaders of Transcaucasian states 
and the heads of military delegations demonstrates that in a 
number of cases dialogue around the negotiating table is 
undoubtedly successful for the "diplomats in uniform." 
  Despite naming the objectives of his visit upon landing at 
Yerevan Airport, when Pavel Grachev noted that he had come "in 
connection with the start of the summer military training period 
which is designed to test the combat effectiveness and condition 
of the Russian troops stationed in Armenia," it is clear that 
the tasks he will address during his visit are far broader. 
This is evidenced by his plans to meet with the region's heads 
of state. The dialogue that has already taken place between the 
Russian Federation defense minister and Armenian President Levon 
Ter-Petroysan has been acknowledged to be fruitful by both 
sides. During the talks they discussed issues connected with the 
siting of Russian military units on the republic's territory, 
and also the possibility of young Armenian performing service in 
these units. It is well-known that under the treaty signed by 
the heads of both states, a Russian motorized infantry division 
is stationed at Gyumri in Armenia and another regiment is 
stationed near Yerevan. Army Gen. Grachev spoke highly of 
cooperation with Armenia's military department. 
  During their talks they also discussed the terms for sending 
peacemaking forces into the region. This problem will also be 
discussed by Army Gen. Grachev at his upcoming meeting in Baku 
11 June with Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev. On 10 June 
the Russian defense minister flies to Tbilisi, where he intends 
to meet with Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze. According to 
information from the Abkhazian Ministry of Information and the 
Press, Pavel Grachev also plans to meet with Vladislav Ardzinba, 
commander in chief of the republic's armed forces, and the 
Abkhazian Government; during this meeting he will discuss 
deploying peacemaking forces along the Inguri River.

  [Text] Moscow is warning that if the law on citizenship, 
which Latvia's parliament adopted Thursday at its second 
reading, comes into effect, "this may seriously complicate 
relations between Russia and Latvia," and Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin may have to postpone his visit to Riga, Russian 
Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin told Interfax Friday. 
  Churkin said he hoped that the law on citizenship will not 
have an impact on the implementation of the agreements on troop 
withdrawal, on the situation of retired Russian servicemen and 
on the issue of the radar station in Skrunda signed by the two 
countries' presidents in Moscow. He said these agreements were 
too important to be affected even by such a serious document as 
the law on citizenship.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Boris Krivoshey] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 10 TASS -- Russia will continue active 
mediation in settlement of the trans-Dniester conflict, 
plenipotentiary representative of the Russian president 
Vladillen Vasev told ITAR-TASS today upon the completion of his 
Moldovan trip. 
  Slightly more than a month has passed since the signing of a 
joint statement by Moldovan and trans-Dniester leaders, he said. 
This period can be described as organizational. Working groups 
have been set up to focus on financial, economic relations and 
political settlement, which is the future state-legal status of 
the trans- Dniester region. 
  "Economic issues are natural and there are people who are 
tackling these problems. I think it will be easy for them to 
pull their efforts and elaborate corresponding agreements. They 
have already started to do it," said Vasev. 
  In his opinion, the issue of financial-economic relations 
remains difficult. It is a certain stumbling stone in 
Moldovan-trans- Dniester relations. "But I think the sides will 
solve this problem," he added. 
  The most difficult problem is still the state-legal status 
of 
the trans-Dniester region. The problem is in the focus of the 
sides' leaders and heads of expert groups - First Deputy 
Moldovan Foreign Minister Nikolae Osmokescu and trans-Dniester 
State Secretary Valeriy Litskay. 
  On the whole, the current stage of negotiations can be 
described as preparatory. "Despite certain differences and 
rather heated debates, one can say that the general stand of the 
sides has become more constructive, they intend to reach 
compromises and certain results have been achieved. The 
preparatory period is necessary to reach agreements. The sides 
have fixed no time for them, but it would be better not to drag 
out this period," said Vasev.

<F P=106> [Sergey Knyazkov report: "Constructive Talks Held. But </F>
Differences in Timetable for 14th Army's Withdrawal From 
Moldavia [Moldova] Have Remained"] 
  [Text] Informing readers in yesterday's issue of KRASNAYA 
ZVEZDA on the progress of the Russian-Moldavian negotiations, at 
which the timetable for the withdrawal of the Russian 14th Army 
from the territory of Moldavia was discussed, we presented some 
preliminary details. The delegation heads' news conference to a 
large extent clarified the sides' positions. According to the 
Russian delegation's leader, Vladimir Kitayev, on the basis of 
military experts' conclusions and calculations a period of four, 
not three, years will be required for the troops' withdrawal. 
Russia is prepared to look into the possibility of reducing this 
period, but it will be greater than Kishinev [Chisinau] expects 
-- the latter considers that the 14th Army should be withdrawn 
no later than 1 January 1996. Nevertheless, it was stated at 
the news conference that this question has already been resolved 
as far as possible, and it is likely that the sides will come to 
a final decision at the negotiations' 10th round. 
  Indeed, not a single document was initialed in the 
negotiations' ninth round, but the outward "tardiness" of these 
negotiations going back to 8 August 1992 mask an inner tension. 
  "We do not want the troop withdrawal to be accompanied by 
mass actions on the part of Dniester Region inhabitants, 
rallies, pickets, and other excesses," Colonel Eduard Vorobyev, 
head of the Russian delegation's military side, explained. "We 
wish to take all aspects of the problem into account, and I 
believe the withdrawal will proceed in an organized manner when 
full mutual understanding between the Russian and Moldavian 
delegations is reached and the Dniester Region's interests are 
taken into consideration to such an extent that the leadership 
and the bulk of the population of the Dniester's left bank will 
participate in guaranteeing this process." 
  It is worth reminding readers that since the start of the 
negotiations three Russian units have been withdrawn from 
Moldavia and 18 have been disbanded on site; also, eight 
interstate agreements have been concluded and are being 
implemented successfully.

  [Text] St. Petersburg June 11 TASS -- Vietnamese Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet paid an unexpected visit to St. Petersburg 
on Saturday to wait for the Russian prime minister to return 
from his vacation. 
  Originally, the talks between the 70-member Vietnamese 
delegation and the Russian Government were scheduled for June 8- 
10, but were postponed because of Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin's vacation until June 15-17. 
  The remaining four days the Vietnamese premier decided to 
spend in St. Petersburg, Russia's second largest city and the 
twin city of Ho Chi Minh City. 
  At a meeting at the St. Petersburg mayor's office, Vo Van 
Kiet regretted that there is still some mistrust left in 
relations between Russia and Vietnam, but added that "Russia is 
a special friend" for Vietnam. "The former Soviet Union always 
helped us in the most difficult periods of Vietnam's life. We 
will never forget that," the premier said.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 0525 GMT on 11 June carries a three-minute report 
over video in the Parliamentary Week program on Federation 
Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko's recent two-week trip to 
Latin America. The program includes an interview with Shumeyko 
on the results of his trip. The date of the interview is not 
given. Shumeyko is seen seated behind a desk. Shumeyko says: 
  "I would like to emphasize that the visit was, of course, 
approved by President Boris Yeltsin and the Foreign Ministry at 
every stage. In other words, it was a simple parliamentary 
exchange worked out beforehand at the highest level. 
  "As to the issues we touched upon there -- and I had 
meetings with presidents, foreign ministers, heads of both 
chambers of parliament where a country had a two-chambered 
parliament, and with business circles, banks and so on -- as to, 
then, the whole range of issues we touched upon, they departed 
considerably from the usual sort involved in interparliamentary 
contacts. 
  "And the fact is that the geopolitical situation itself 
obliges us to maintain contacts of this kind today. Latin 
America is a traditional interest of the United States. That's 
quite clear. But the fact is that the bipolar world model has 
disappeared and the two superpowers no longer exist. They 
remain great and strong powers, but they are no longer called 
superpowers in the sense that they used to be. The blocs that 
used to exist between them aren't there anymore. And the Third 
World which used to be called the Third World has changed 
completely. You and I saw that in Latin America where things 
have changed totally. 
  "And so, although these are traditional zones of interest of 
the United States, the United States market cannot handle all 
the output they (the Latin American states) can produce today, 
however much it would like to. The Latin American countries 
have already shaken off their chains and are looking for 
partners. We're looking for partners, too."

  [Text) St. Petersburg June 12 TASS -- Russian cosmonaut 
Sergey Krikalev has mastered a new profession as he took 
American astronauts, with whom he was in space together on board 
the American Discovery spaceship, on a sightseeing tour around 
the city as a guide. 
  Four out of the six-member crew of the Discovery spaceship 
arrived in St. Petersburg, while the other two remained in 
Moscow on business. Jane Davis said when visiting the St. 
Petersburg mayor's office at midday on Sunday, that the 
astronauts had often watched St. Petersburg from space, but 
close acquaintance with the city was all the more pleasant. The 
city is wonderful, the American guest said. Pilot Kenneth 
Roitler expressed confidence that the U.S. and Russia would 
continue joint experiments in space. Russian cosmonaut Sergey 
Krikalev pointed out that difficulties Russia is going through 
should not impede the development of national space research. 
Both the Russian cosmonaut and his American colleagues 
expressed readiness to make another space flight together. 
  On behalf of the space crew, a collection of photographs, 
including snapshots of the start of the Discovery, the 
astronauts on board and pictures of the astronauts, was 
presented to the St. Petersburg mayor's office. The city Mayor 
Anatoliy Sobschak was presented with a unique snapshot of the 
city taken from space. 
  On June 14, the American astronauts will depart to the 
United 
States.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Orlov and Feliks Babitskiy report under the </F>
"Opposition" rubric: "`Pray for the Freedom of Palestine!' 
AL-QUDS appeals to Russians"] 
  [Text] The opposition's "second echelon," having found an 
attentive audience at the festivities of AL-QUDS newspaper held 
in Moscow 3-5 June, has yet again called on Russians to unite to 
fight "Yeltsin's hateful regime." The appeals from A. Nevzorov, 
S. Terekhov, S. Umalatova, and Ye. Ligachev have by no means 
facilitated stabilization. "Thanks to our rulers, the people 
are being destroyed, both morally and physically," Umalatova 
stated. "They are like vampires, in need of blood," she 
continued. "We have had enough of demagogues, we have had 
enough of philosophers!" S. Terekhov has called on people not 
to believe in the "clannish struggle" inside the ruling camp. 
"They are preparing," he warned, and advised people to do 
everything to see that they do not take "patriots" unawares. 
Yegor Ligachev proposed a plan for the restoration of the USSR. 
  Events with the participation of opposition leaders take 
place constantly. However, let us ask ourselves the question: 
Why is a newspaper with an Arabic name, published by Dr. 
Sha'ban Hafiz Sha'ban, and committed to the liberation of 
Palestine from Israel, attracting the Russian opposition to its 
pages and its parties? Why (as S. Umalatova has admitted) did 
Mr. Sha'ban fund the extraordinary congress of USSR people's 
deputies? 
  The motives by which Dr. Sha'ban is guided are obvious. 
First, he is committed to changing Russia's foreign policy in 
the Near East, to redirecting it from supporting Y. 'Arafat to 
helping the leaders of the Palestine opposition. Obviously, a 
further aim of AL-QUDS is to destabilize the Russian 
Federation's relations with Israel. Second, in the event of the 
hardline opposition coming to power, the network of commercial 
enterprises headed by Mr. Sha'ban would obviously receive 
most-favored status from the Russian leadership. 
  However, even if our assumptions are incorrect, one thing is 
clear -- the main aim of AL-QUDS and its publisher is the 
destabilization of the situation in Russia, Which, in our view, 
by no means does them credit.

<F P=106> [Ravil Mustafin article: "Persian Gulf: New Exacerbation </F>
of Iranian-Saudi Relations"] 
  [Excerpts] It has become a bad tradition that relations 
between Iran and Saudi Arabia, those two leading forces in the 
region today, become exacerbated with the onset of the season of 
pilgrimage to the places in Mecca and Medina which are holy to 
every Muslim. A majority of observers link -- quite reasonably 
-- the cyclical growth of tension in this already unquiet corner 
of the globe with Tehran's attempts to politicize religious 
ceremonies for its own political and propaganda purposes. 
[passage omitted] 
  We should not expect a lowering of the level of rivalry 
caused by the two countries' desire to occupy the leading 
position both in the region and throughout the Islamic world. 
  Tehran, which aspires to the role of the expresser of the 
interests of all Muslims, will hardly resign itself to the fact 
that Riyadh, the "imperialists' accomplice," retains the title 
of custodian of Islam's main holy places. The contradictions 
between Tehran and Riyadh also concern a wide range of 
international problems, including the Near East settlement. 
Iran continues to deny the possibility of reaching agreement 
with Israel and advocates its destruction. 
  Under these conditions Moscow's position with regard to 
Tehran and Riyadh appears delicate, to put it mildly. On the 
one hand, Saudi Arabia is one of the greatest states of the Arab 
world, in which it objectively plays an increasingly weighty 
role by virtue of its financial, economic, and geostrategic 
potential and resources. True, cooperation between our 
countries has not enjoyed the necessary development, and the 
arms market is in the hands of Western companies -- above all, 
U.S. ones -- and will most likely be entirely geared to them for 
the next five to 10 years. On the other hand there is Iran, 
which borders on the southern underbelly of the CIS and with 
which traditional ties have long existed. In this situation 
there is no alternative but, at best, to urge the sides not to 
work toward something sinful, i.e. an altercation involving 
weapons.

  [Text] [Correspondent L. Panova] Before leaving for Sofia 
today, in an exclusive interview given to Vesti, Vladimir 
Shumeyko, head of the Russian parliament's upper chamber and 
chairman of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly, said that 
everything necessary should be done in order to ensure that 
former Union republics that are now independent CIS countries 
could integrate together again as soon as possible. 
  [Begin Shumeyko recording] Many people can say here: 
Interesting, first the Union was destroyed, and now it is being 
pieced together. The thing is that the Soviet Union was a 
monolithic state supported by a single axis of authority--the 
CPSU. The party that used to make decisions on everything and 
for everybody does not exist today. Bulgaria and Poland were 
regarded as being so close to us that it was sufficient for the 
CPSU to make a decision on giving aid, sending a delegation, 
starting to build a factory or something else, and all this was 
implemented. [end recording] 
  [Panova] Bulgaria's and Poland's historical closeness still 
exists, Vladimir Shumeyko believes, but legislative decisions 
are needed in relations with that Far Abroad in order to unite 
states again as closely as possible in economic and political 
integration. 
  [Begin Shumeyko recording] Our parliamentary delegation 
which 
is going at insistent requests from the Polish and Bulgarian 
parliaments is of a state nature. During these few days we will 
try once again to identify all our points of contact. For 
instance, 10 Russian regions have direct links with Bulgaria. 
They should be backed at a state and legislative level in order 
to integrate together again. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Vladimir Abrosimov and Lyudmila </F>
Yermakova] 
  [Text] Sofia, 12 Jun -- The Russian Federation Council's 
delegation led by Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the chamber, 
arrived on an official visit in Bulgaria today. 
  At Sofia airport the guests were welcomed by Aleksandur 
Yordanov, chairman of the National Assembly (parliament). 
Talking to an ITAR- TASS correspondent he described the visit 
as "a culmination point in the contacts between the two 
countries' parliaments that have become especially active of 
late." I believe, he noted, that in the upcoming conversations 
we will find many points in common on issues of developing 
relations between Bulgaria and Russia in different spheres, and 
will also exchange views on the situation in the Balkans and 
Europe. 
  According to V. Shumeyko, relations between these two states 
are now being built on a basis of equality determined by ideas 
of freedom and sovereignty. At the same time, they do not 
hamper the development of traditional ties between Russia and 
Bulgaria. Both parliaments can do a great deal, first of all, 
"by orientating legislations toward each other," something 
without which progress in other spheres can hardly be expected. 
This is one of the issues to which we attach considerable 
importance, the chairman of the Federation Council stressed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Rear Admiral Iliya Popov, Bulgarian Navy </F>
chief of staff, by Captain 1st Rank Vladimir Pasyakin: 
"Bulgaria Will Build Its Own Corvettes and Maintain Friendly 
Links With All Navies in the Black Sea"] 
  [Text] A Bulgarian naval detachment, comprising the 
corvette "Reshitelni" and the auxiliary "Kapitan Dimitur 
Dobrev," made a routine port call in Novorossiysk. Our 
correspondent met with the detachment commander, Rear Admiral 
Iliya Popov, Bulgarian navy chief of staff. 
  [Pasyakin] Mr. Admiral, what is the purpose of your call? 
  [Popov] In the first place, to continue the development of 
friendly links between our navies. Second, we wanted to give 
our commissioned and petty officers and seamen an opportunity to 
see the sights in this splendid Russian city and to meet with 
seamen of the Russian Federation Black Sea Fleet. We used the 
sea passage for combat training and improvement of our naval 
combat proficiency, including organizing the towing of ships and 
keeping watch, and for damage control exercises... 
  [Pasyakin] In your view, what are the prospects for the 
development of relations between our countries and, accordingly, 
between navies? 
  [Popov] I can only talk about relations between our navies, 
because relations between countries are the prerogative of 
presidents and governments. As well as the contacts that have 
already taken place between our navies, this year will see the 
"Briz-94" exercise, which is planned for 25-29 July. We have 
invited warships from many countries to the exercise. I am 
talking about two missile boats from the Romanian Navy, one ship 
each from the Ukrainian Navy and Russian Federation Black Sea 
Fleet, a Turkish frigate, two missile boats from the Greek Navy, 
and two ships from the U.S. 6th Fleet. Representatives from 
Georgia have been invited (we know it has no navy, but it does 
have access to the Black Sea). Recently I was told that Italy 
and France had shown an interest in this exercise. If they ask 
to be given the go-ahead to participate, obviously we will agree. 
  As for contacts with the Russian Navy, we have already 
exchanged preliminary protocols, which we intend to sign. They 
take account of what kind of ties there will be between our 
navies. On the basis of the protocol we will then sign a 
bilateral cooperation plan. In July there will be the exercise 
I talked about. In August the training ship "Gangut," carrying 
students from Russian naval schools, will call on us in Varna. 
  We have also planned some events for next year and they have 
already been agreed with our general staff. At the end of 
April, for example, we intend to hold a symposium, inviting all 
the countries of the Black Sea and Mediterranean regions. This 
symposium will be similar to the one in 1993. On that occasion 
we entertained visitors from 14 countries. This time we expect 
there to be more. 
  [Pasyakin] What are the aims and tasks of the exercise you 
mentioned? 
  [Popov] The task is Bulgarian Navy participation in 
peacemaking operations to provide humanitarian aid. The aims? 
First and foremost, to have the opportunity to get acquainted 
with representatives of the various fleets we have invited, to 
exchange experience. Second, to test communications and 
rehearse collaboration between ships from different states, and 
joint actions on damage control and protection of transports 
delivering humanitarian aid, and assisting a submarine "in 
distress"... In short, rehearsing episodes of a nonoffensive 
nature. 
  [Pasyakin] Mr. Admiral, how does Bulgaria intend to update 
its navy? According to my information, you used to buy your 
ships and equipment from the USSR. 
  [Popov] We are certainly faced with the task of updating our 
pool of ships. But it is too expensive buying other countries' 
ships. So this question, after consultation with the general 
staff and the Defense Ministry, evolved into the elaboration of 
our own national shipbuilding program. Civilian institutes with 
shipbuilding associations, shipyards, scientific research 
institutes, and plants producing what goes into ships -- 
communications facilities, radar and navigation equipment, 
armaments -- are participating in its creation. 
  The approval of the program by the general staff military 
council is planned for the summer. Then it will go to the 
Council of Ministers for its approval. Why? Because the 
intention is that the money should come not from the Defense 
Ministry budget, but direct from the state budget. 
  We are unable to buy foreign military technology with hard 
currency. It is very important too that the allocated funds 
should circulate within the country, creating jobs. We also 
want to involve other countries in the implementatioon of the 
program. And I am not just talking about foreign investments in 
our industry. You will agree that it is extravagant to make two 
or three ships just for our navy. Series production, that is, 
for other countries too, is cheaper. 
  [Pasyakin] Incidentally, what class of ships do you intend 
to build? 
  [Popov] Primarily, "corvette" class, of 900-1,2000 tonnes. 
But if we find a country that agrees to participate in this 
project, then serial production will increase, and we will even 
try to enter the world market. And not only with corvettes. I 
am talking about minesweepers and missile boats as well. 
  [Pasyakin] Since we are talking about financial problems, 
the next question is what is the naval funding situation? At 
the reception on your ship I saw publicity from several 
Bulgarian firms... 
  [Popov] The finance, and I am talking about the upkeep of 
ships, seamen's pay, and all the rest, comes out of the state 
budget. As for visits and foreign port calls by our ships, like 
this one, we get a lot of help from sponsors -- individual firms 
with which we conclude contracts. Sponsorship takes the form of 
goods. Gifts, souvenirs, food, drink. We are forbidden to 
accept money. We, in turn, advertise these firms' goods in 
foreign ports. 
  [Pasyakin] Mr. Admiral, what is Bulgarian military doctrine 
in relation to your navy based on today? 
  [Popov] A military doctrine has been adopted in Bulgaria 
which obliges us to defend the country. It is not possible for 
us to create a big navy in the Black Sea. The navies of the 
Black Sea states are much stronger than ours. The idea behind 
the development of the Bulgarian Navy, in accordance with the 
military doctrine, is based on the navy's basic task of 
weakening as much as possible forces that are trying to attack 
us from the sea. That is, to cause the enemy losses that would 
frustrate its aggressive plans. That is, the navy's tasks are 
purely defensive. 
  [Pasyakin] I know that the Soviet Navy's ships used to be 
repaired at Bulgaria's "Flotski Arsenal" and "Odessos" yards. 
What is the state of affairs in this sphere today? 
  [Popov] It is difficult to give a full answer, because the 
repair yard in Varna is not under naval control, but is directly 
linked to the ministry. I cannot say what the enterprise's 
plans are, but I would point out that a delegation from the 
Russian Defense Ministry went to Varna in April. An 
understanding was reached on the repair of Russian ships at our 
yard. We are interrested in these contacts. Russian orders 
will strengthen the yard's position, and ours too, since 
"Flotski Arsenal" also repairs the Bulgarian Navy's ships.

<F P=106> [Boris Rodionov report: "Transfer Ruble Equated to Dollar </F>
Retrospectively. Russia To Pay Czech Republic 3.5 Billion By 
2003"] 
  [Excerpts] Moscow and Prague have reached agreement on the 
terms of the repayment of the Russian debts built up in the last 
years of the USSR's existence and inherited by Russia. [passage 
omitted] 
  Russian Foreign Ministry circles are noting that this 
agreement is the result of a compromise brought about by the 
recent talks between [Czech premier] Klaus and Viktor 
Chernomyrdin. It makes it possible to galvanize Russo-Czech 
economic (and not only economic) ties -- something that both 
sides are interested in. For Prague in particular it is 
important, in comparison with Bratislava, to make up some ground 
in its Ostpolitik. 
  The agreement between the Czech Republic and Russia may help 
to resolve the difficult problem of mutual financial claims 
between Russia and Poland and between Russian and Bulgaria. In 
these two cases it is a question both of the former USSR's debts 
to its partners, and of debts on the part of the partners 
themselves. And Moscow's dollar loans were kept secret. In the 
case of Poland, certain specialists believe, the zero option of 
a mutual write-off of the debt is possible. 
  The extent to which it is necessary to dump the ballast of 
the past in favor of wide-ranging trading relations is shown by 
the example of Budapest. Hungary was the first of the former 
CEMA countries to settle the Soviet debt problem, accepting 
MiG-29 fighters and other military equipment as payment. In 
lieu of the outstanding sum -- $900 million -- the Hungarians 
intend to take part in the privatization of the Russian oil and 
gas complex and other enterprises. The agreement has cleared 
the way for the gradual restoration of trade and industrial 
ties, and Hungary now occupies first place in trade with Russia 
among all the former Soviet CEMA partners.

  [Text] The Paris Club, uniting 18 countries who are Russian 
creditors, is ready to negotiate with Moscow next autumn on ways 
of resscheduling foreign debt repayment on a long-term basis. 
Before, such loan-restructuring agreements were concluded 
annually. 
  "An upcoming agreement is to significantly change the 
structure of Russia's foreign debt, bringing it in line with 
what the country can really afford to pay," says a statement, 
released by Russia's Foreign Ministry on Friday. 
  In early June, Moscow and the Paris Club signed an 
agreement, 
deferring payments on a 7-billion-dollar Russian debt. Payments 
will be evenly distributed over 8-17 years with a 3-year easy 
term. 
  A senior Finance Ministry official reported to the Financial 
Information Agency that in subsequent negotiations with the 
Paris Club Moscow hopes to get a deferment for 1994 on the 
payment of yet another 20 billion dollars. 
  Earlier, the Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin declared that 
to 
secure a long-term debt deferment accord Russia must agree with 
the IMF on an economic program, which, if negotiations succeed, 
could be backed up by an IMF Stand-by credit worth 4 billion 
dollars. Appropriate talks are expected in autumn this year. 
  According to federal budget expenditures for 1994, Moscow is 
ready to repay a 4.1 billion dollars toward debts. 
  The former USSR debts total 80 billion dollars, about 10 
percent of which is Russia's part.

<F P=106> [Viktor Belikov report: "Boeings Replenish Aeroflot"] </F>
  [Excerpts] The first Boeing 767 leased by Aeroflot Russian 
International Airlines will be handed over in 10 days' time at 
the airfield attached to the world's largest aircraft 
manufacturing complex near Seattle. The second such aircraft 
will be handed over there a week later. [passage omitted] 
  The details of this unique deal were recounted by A. Brylov, 
Aeroflot's deputy executive director: 
  "The need to take out a five-year lease on the Boeing 767's 
was brought about by the fact that the number of transatlantic 
flights has increased considerably of late, there will be even 
more of them in the very near future, and our route network to 
the United States is expanding. We simply do not have the 
aircraft to service all these routes. After all, routes to San 
Francisco or Chicago have to be flown by modern, highly 
comfortable long-haul airliners -- the distances involved are 
considerable and the passengers want a nonstop service. 
Otherwise they will use another carrier -- all the more so as 
the choice of airline on these routes is getting wider and wider. 
  "The appearance of U.S.-made aircraft in the Aeroflot fleet 
will make our airline more competitive. These are reliable 
aircraft from the safety angle. They burn far less fuel than 
the obsolete Il-62's and the not very suitable Il-86's. It is 
also an important factor that American passengers traditionally 
place more trust in their own equipment, so this will make them 
more willing to fly with a Russian carrier. 
  "All this," A. Brylov continued, "is going to allow us to 
turn flights from the United States from today's loss-makers 
into a profitable operation -- provided that the government 
authorities meet Aeroflot halfway and allow it to use the 
Boeings for five years without having to pay huge customs duties 
or import tax. During the five years of the Boeing lease, the 
Russian aircraft industry will be able to substantially increase 
the number of long-haul Il-96-300's it produces, and the U.S. 
airliners will be returned to their owner. For the time being, 
they will be beginning regular flights between Moscow and New 
York in July."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksey Yerovchenkov] </F>
  [Text] Nicosia June 10 TASS -- "I believe that my visit to 
Russia was successful from every point of view, and the talks I 
had with Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev in Moscow were very 
resultative," Cyprus Foreign Minister Alexandros Mikhailidhis 
told ITAR-TASS at the International Airport of Larnaca upon his 
return home from Russia. 
  "There are sufficient grounds for this success, because 
Russia and Cyprus are linked by good relations from time 
immemorial. We have a common culture and we worship the same 
religion. The peoples of our two countries are cooperating 
fruitfully in the economic sphere". 
  "I wish to note especially my talks with Andrey Kozyrev, 
which were marked by an atmosphere of complete mutual 
understanding," the minister stressed. "The Russian side has 
displayed not only its understanding of the Cyprus problem, but 
also readiness to help resolve it in every possible way. It is 
also pertinent to note that Russia is behind two out of the five 
versions for settling the Cyprus problem, included in the report 
of the U.N. secretary- general. All this gives food for 
satisfaction and we hope that a correct way was found to settle 
the Cyprus problem." 
  "Problems linked with the expansion of Russo-Cyprus economic 
relations were also thoroughly discussed in Moscow. For 
instance, we examined the possibility of implementing an 
inter-governmental agreement, which envisages the participation 
of Cyprus in the development of one of the Black Sea regions of 
Russia, mainly the Krasnodar territory. I have visited that 
region and it produced a very good impression on me. I think 
that our cooperation with the Krasnodar territory will be 
mutually profitable and successful." 
  "To put it in a nutshell," Mikhailidhis noted, "new broad 
vistas for deepening multilateral cooperation are now opening up 
before our two nations."

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] On Thursday President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree 
"On Participation of the Russian Federation in the Peacekeeping 
Operation in the Zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian Conflict". 
  As reports the presidential press service, issuance of this 
decree was caused by aggravation of the situation in the 
conflict zone, support of this peacekeeping operation on the 
part of CIS countries, and the request on the part of Georgian 
and Abkhazian leaders to urgently deploy peacekeeping forces in 
the conflict zone. 
  Yeltsin commissioned the government to ensure formation of 
an 
appropriate military contingent on the basis of the Russian 
units which have the status of peacekeeping forces by using the 
infrastructure of the Group of the Russian Forces in 
Transcaucases. The Russian contingent can be later on 
strengthened on the decision of the Federation Council of the RF 
Federal Assembly. 
  The decree is to go into effect since the moment of its 
signing, however, in accordance with the RF Constitution the 
Federation Council is to determine the time of the operation. 
The next sitting of the upper chamber has been scheduled for 
June 21, however, Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the chamber, 
does not rule out that he would convene an extraordinary sitting 
to consider this issue. IF Note: The previous week the upper 
chamber of the Russian parliament declined Boris Yeltsin's 
request to approve introduction of Russian peacekeeping forces 
into the zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict (with a 
majority of only one vote). 
  Meanwhile, on Thursday Russian Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev 
reported to Interfax in Yerevan that everything is ready for the 
introduction of peacekeeping forces into the zone of the 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict, "however, decision of politicians 
is needed to start the operation."

<F P=106> [Statement by Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko </F>
marking Russia's Independence Day, on 11 June; place not given 
-- recorded] 
  [Text] [Shumeyko] The declaration of the sovereignty of 
Russia was adopted four years ago, on 12 June 1990. All the 
deputies stood up and greeted this with long applause. Probably 
not everyone thought then what sovereignty was about, what a 
free state was. The fact of the matter is that many deputies, 
almost the overwhelming majority at the Russian Congress of 
People's Deputies, won the elections on denial, on the denial of 
the system that existed then, on the denial of the CPSU as the 
power in Russia, the power on which the whole Soviet Union was 
based. Appealing to their electorate, they said: We are fed up 
with all of this. We cannot live like this any longer. We 
cannot live any longer in this totalitarian state in which man, 
his spirit repressed, where none of us is free. The electorate 
agreed with them. They elected these deputies. 
  The time has come for reflection -- if we are deputies of 
the 
Russian Federation -- where is that Russia, what sort of a state 
is it? How should it be built and developed further? When the 
sovereignty of Russia was declared the Soviet Union was in 
existence. There was the center. There was the CPSU Central 
Committee Politburo. There was Gorbachev, the general secretary 
who announced perestroyka, acceleration, the building of 
socialism with a human face. That classic phrase, the process 
has got under way [as heard] belongs to him. Where has it "got 
under way" to? 
  All of that so-called perestroyka in my view was 
characterized by a whole series of economic crimes, which 
essentially led to the complete failure of the socialist 
economy, of an economy that was formed way back during Stalinist 
five-year plans, an economy that was then supported by everyone. 
But out of all the decisions that were made, I recall one hazy 
fact -- we woke up one morning and we were told: We will form 
cooperatives and that is it -- there will be happiness. 
  Students will work there, the unemployed section of the 
population, pensioners -- they will produce so much from 
remnants and scraps resulting from productive processes that our 
store shelves will be cracking under the weight of goods. How 
wonderful cooperatives are, they kept saying. 
  Then we woke up one beautiful morning to hear: No to 
cooperatives, cooperatives are bad, they should be banned and 
destroyed. 
  Then they allowed cooperatives to turn non-cash into cash. 
Only now have I discovered that in that period, during eight 
months of 1988, 600 billion rubles were converted from non-cash 
into cash. That is 600 billion of those rubles. In today's 
money it is 600 trillion. All goods disappeared. By the end of 
1990 they just disappeared -- all -- remember empty shelves in 
Moscow! The market of goods disappeared. One could return it 
only by freeing prices. But we did not know it then! Nobody 
knew how the economy would develop. 
  The sovereign and free Russia became the heir to the Soviet 
Union at the exact moment when the socialist economy was 
finished for good -- when there were empty shelves, barter 
relations, and so on. First we were fighting to separate 
ourselves from the center and to prove that Russia is 
independent and sovereign -- and we proved it. However, this 
sovereign independent state was left with all the problems 
accumulated by the previous leadership. This old leadership 
dumped them, as it were, on the new leadership. 
  Now there is an interesting fact -- there are claims that it 
is Yeltsin and the Gaydar government that are to blame for 
everything, and for breaking apart this powerful great Soviet 
Union. Now nobody remembers, even for a minute, that the 
shelves were empty, that there were huge lines, that Valentin 
Pavlov changed money, and so on. All these brawls are 
forgotten, and now there are new difficulties. 
  June 12 is a holiday despite everything, a great holiday. 
Why? Because it is from that day that we started building the 
new Russia. Not even new, to be exact. It is impossible to 
build Russia from scratch. Russia is a universe, a huge state, 
which at some point of its development turned into an empire 
from sea to sea. On its way, Russia absorbed new peoples, 
cultures, confessions and traditions. It turned into a 
multi-ethnic multi-million state. 
  It remains the same today. But today it is no longer a 
single state, it is not under the authority of the csar or the 
general secretary -- csar or center, it is all the same. Today, 
at last, Russia is free in the respect that it is a federal 
state. Thanks to Russia becoming a sovereign state, a federal 
state, it has been preserved as a single state and has not 
disintegrated. But today everybody should be thinking about how 
to preserve, how to strengthen, how to consolidate the state, in 
the first place. It would be better if we learned to think: 
First of all, we are citizens of Russia and then politicians, 
because today many decisions are taken to gratify immediate 
political aims, to please a political group, party or faction, 
and so on and so forth. But people lead quite different lives 
-- not at all like politicians. They want the state to be 
powerful and strong, to allow man to live alright, to earn as 
much money as he can, to provide for his family. 
  We are building a law-governed state where law is the 
cornerstone. No matter what is said, nonetheless, the 
Constitution was adopted on 12 December 1993. This Constitution 
contains all the achievements of socialism in the social 
respect. As for spiritual values -- they are enshrined in it -- 
free education, health care, the possibility to live as a human 
being in that society. For the first time human rights have 
been secured. The Constitution has started to operate directly. 
If the Constitution is violated, a person has the right to go 
to court. But all of that still has to be built. The 
Constitution's operation must be ensured. Society is still 
living by other laws and nobody goes to court when his rights 
are violated. 
  The first stage of democratic transformations and the 
construction of a law-governed state began on 12 June 1990 when 
sovereignty was declared. The second stage of our life began on 
12 December 1993 when the new Constitution was adopted. 
  These two stages were completely different. The first stage 
was the romantic transition to democracy, when everything seemed 
quick, everything seemed possible. It seemed that there would 
be mutual understanding between everyone. But then colossal 
economic difficulties set in, every day, ordinary life began. 
Then it was no longer good enough to make speeches, call people 
out on the streets, hold rallies, it was time to work. Every 
day. 
  Over these four years, it was my fortune to be a deputy 
chairman of the Supreme Soviet and first deputy prime minister 
of the government. I now lead the Federation Council. How 
should those in power today be described? 
  I would put it like this. Today they are concerned about the 
state to a greater degree. In the past, the authorities were 
more concerned about staying in power. There was also a stage 
when it seemed to the Moscow authorities, the people here, that 
they were actually the only authority in Russia. It seemed that 
Moscow could take decisions for the whole of Russia. That was a 
great mistake. They failed to appreciate that the regional 
authorities were just as, or even more powerful. 
  Ask me when I had the greatest power and I can tell you that 
it was when I was a director general. I had 13,000 staff and I 
had full authority over all the issues at my industrial 
association. 
  Now, despite the lofty post, I have a lot less real power. 
Perhaps it is of a different sort, manifesting itself in a 
different way? The Federation Council, which represents the 
subjects of the Federation, is the essence of that authority of 
the regions, which is really the authority of Russia, that power 
which is being wielded among people every day. Those in power 
now are basically characterized by their awareness that things 
are done, not at the center, not in Moscow, but in consultation 
with everyone, all over Russia. The greater this awareness, the 
better for Russia. Those in power need to understand that the 
more you give the more you receive.

<F P=106> [Petr Karapetyan report: "Vladimir Shumeyko Advocated </F>
Increased Spending on Army. Conference with Leaders of Organs 
of Representative Power of Components of Russian Federation Held 
in Federation Council"] 
  [Text] The main areas of cooperation between the upper 
chamber of the Federal Assembly and the components of the 
Russian Federation in such areas as economic reform, the 
strengthening of federalism, and the elaboration of 
nationalities policy and a new regional strategy were discussed 
at the conference. 
  Participating in the conference were Vladimir Shumeyko, Ivan 
Rybkin, leaders of committees and commissions of the Federation 
Council and the State Duma, vice premiers of the government, 
ministers, representatives of the president's staff and the 
Central Electoral Commission, leaders of all-Russian and 
interregional unions and associations, and scientists. 
Following the discussion and the adoption of the final 
document, the Coordinating Council for Cooperation Between the 
Chambers of the Federal Assembly and Organs of Representative 
Power of the Components of the Russian Federation was elected. 
  Vladimir Shumeyko pointed out at the conference that the 
process of political stabilization is growing in Russia and is 
based on the Constitution, the strengthening of the organs of 
representative power, and the Treaty on Civil Peace and Accord 
signed by the country's main political forces. At the same 
time, Shumeyko emphasized, two extremes can be ruinous to 
Russia: Both overestimation of the significance of the regions' 
autonomy and underestimation of the role of the center. "The 
actual political decision that can be made today," the chairman 
of the Federation Council emphasized, "is the adoption of the 
budget." It is his firm conviction that the budget must 
determine policy in the state. Vladimir Shumeyko once again 
advocated increasing expenditure on the Army and the 
military-industrial complex.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Federation Council Speaker Vladimir </F>
Shumeyko by INTERFAX observer Dmitriy Voskoboynikov; place and 
date not given; from the "Novosti-Plyus" program -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Voskoboynikov] [Passage omitted: Dmitriy 
Voskoboynikov recaps recent developments related to Russia's 
regional policy: Yeltsin's visit to Tatarstan; Yuriy Skokov's 
meeting with presidents of Chuvashia, Tatarstan, and 
Bashkortostan in Cheboksary; election of another State Duma 
deputy speaker] 
  In the final analysis, even the conflict between the State 
Duma and the Federation Council over the budget arose, I 
believe, from differing attitudes to the interests of the 
regions. Little wonder, really, since there is no unity at the 
top in attitudes to the provinces. An increasing number of 
analysts note that the role of a man capable of defining a 
common denominator could be played by Federation Council 
Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko. This week he held a major 
conference with leaders of representative bodies of authority 
from numerous regions of Russia. 
  [Shumeyko] There are classic features of a federation. 
First, it is a state made up of independent regions. Second, 
each independent part of a federal state has its own 
legislation. Finally, following the adoption on 12 December 1993 
of the Constitution, we have the last classic feature: A federal 
state has a bicameral parliament, with one chamber directly 
protecting the interests of the regions. Therefore, what I have 
read in the papers of late, claims that Shumeyko is preoccupied 
with something, with some sort of presidential elections, and so 
he has become involved and has organized a party of the 
regions--this is all completely groundless. 
  [Voskoboynikov] If we were to single out the most serious 
problem in relations between the center and the regions, what 
would you say it was? 
  [Shumeyko] The most important one is probably the budget. A 
budget is necessarily political. It manifests the policy of the 
state. This is the purpose of a budget. It is not a sum of 
arithmetical operations. The arguments we often hear about the 
budget nowadays concentrate on figures. But the important thing 
is not the figures. For instance, everyone says that the 
Federation Council and Shumeyko want to ingratiate themselves 
with the military, and that is why they insist on these figures. 
But that is not the point. The point is that for 33 regions, 
the defense sector forms the basis of their industry. The same 
defense industry into which all the potential of the former 
Soviet Union used to be directed. 
  Whatever we say, the State Duma reflects the political 
structure of the state. Half of its deputies were elected on 
party tickets. They adopted the budget on the basis of 
consensus. The faction leaders got together and reached 
political consensus. But thank God, or maybe unfortunately, 
parties nowadays in no way reflect the interests of the 
population of Russia. We have a population of 150 millions, 
while the largest party, the Communist Party, has about 300,000 
members. Regions, on the other hand, reflect the real state of 
affairs in Russia. [passage omitted]

  [Text] We have just received the text of a statement issued 
by the State Duma stressing the groundless nature of criticism 
of the country's budget adopted in the second reading on 8 June. 
The statement notes that even in accordance with the initial 
draft, 20 percent of all budget expenditure was allocated for 
military needs. Moreover, when the budget was passing through 
the second reading it became possible to allocate an additional 
3.5 billion rubles. Sources outside the budget to finance 
defense needs were determined, and Duma experts estimate that 
these will amount to another several trillion rubles. 
  The statement acknowledges that the budget, which reflects 
the actual state of the Russian econony, is extremely tight. 
But, the statement says, the deputies are convinced that 
parliament, and society, through parliament, have to place the 
use of taxpayers' money under strict supervision.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 0525 GMT 11 June carries a seven-minute interview 
with Griroriy Yavlinskiy, the leader of the Yabloko faction in 
the Russian State Duma. The program was recorded 10 June. 
Reception is good. 
  Yavlinskiy is speaking with an unidentified correspondent in 
the lobby of the Duma. He begins by summing up the budget 
debate in the State Duma. Yavlinskiy then asserts that the 
Russian parliament was not properly equipped to debate the 
matter properly. He says that "the Duma was not sufficiently 
prepared to debate each budget amendment individually. This is 
linked with the fact that neither the Duma nor, in my opinion, 
any of the other representative bodies are in any way ready to 
tackle the budget question as such. We lack a control chamber, 
a real budget control committee. Strictly speaking, there is no 
one in Russia's representative bodies independently analyzing 
the budget in detail. This is a serious problem, as the budget 
contains the money of every citizen of this country of ours. 
Under proper conditions, there is always control over how a 
government uses the money entrusted to it." 
  After outlining his faction's proposals to amend the budget, 
noting that 73 percent of these proposals were adopted, 
Yavlinskiy stresses the incompetence of the Duma to tackle the 
budget. He then responds to a question on the political battles 
in the budget debate. 
  Yavlinskiy replies: "From our point of view, this budget 
does 
not mirror the priorities we need to get the country out of 
crisis. We have consistently said that a budget like this is 
not worthy of the country. It does not expand reform, it does 
not make life any easier for people, it puts up taxes, and does 
not address our pressing problems. Moreover, it lacks any 
priorities whatsoever. That was our stance on the budget as a 
whole. so we decided that such a budget should not be passed." 
  Yavlinskiy then turns his attention to the military budget 
and the failed attempt to increase it by 18 trillion rubles. He 
portrays this as an attempt to destabilize the Russian political 
situation. He says: "As for the 18 trillion, then an amendment 
to the budget on that scale should be decided by the president 
as the supreme commander in chief. It happened that neither the 
government nor the president wanted to make such an amendment. 
Strictly speaking, what were the grounds for allowing this 
question to become a topic for debate? I don't think that an 
individual deputy can make an amendment on that scale when the 
budget is in the process of being adopted. 
  "The time up through 10 June has been used to create an 
atmosphere of confrontation. This is a policy we are familiar 
with. We have already gone through one tragedy in connection 
with this policy and it is unfolding again as follows. 
  "There was--and there remains--a problem linked to funding 
defense and the defense industry. The Duma debated the matter. 
Neither the president nor the government had any amendments to 
make on the matter in question. We took the decision we were 
able to take within the limits of the revenue and expenditure 
approved. Then, out of the blue, it was said that the upper 
chamber was principally opposed to the Duma's decision, that it 
was accusing it of some sort of non-statesman-like behavior's, 
and that it was possible that events might so develop that the 
president would address the upper chamber to say that the Duma 
was not up to its job and that the real champions of the 
people's happiness were in the upper chamber. 
  "I want to emphasize that this confrontational situation has 
been created absolutely artificially. The political situation 
has been aggravated for no good reason. It is hard to explain 
why then, for instance, Mr. Rybkin and Mr. Shumeyko signed such 
a grand treaty on accord if the impression is given that they 
are constantly looking for a pretext to create a new enemy. 
  "As for the president, he has still to make his position 
clear on this issue. The last thing I want to see and the thing 
that worries me most is that this whole situation being might be 
used to whip up a gigantic confrontation, between the chambers 
of the Federal Assembly, and then with the president taking the 
side of one of the chambers. That's the most unpleasant aspect 
of this affair."

  [Text] Russia's State Duma (lower chamber of parliament) 
has adopted the draft law on oil and gas (by one vote 
difference), removing from it a provision on the exclusive right 
of the central authorities to "dictate the terms" for 
prospecting, exploration and the actual production of oil and 
gas, their transportation and storage. 
  Interfax was informed by the Russian Fuel and Energy 
Ministry 
that some of the department's functions would now be transferred 
to local authorities. 
  Fuel and Energy Minister Yuriy Shafranik told Interfax that 
the removal of those articles from the draft had been another 
necessary compromise. He said that during a year and a half of 
revision, much had been lost from its content in the search for 
compromises. 
  However, he said he was happy that the draft law had been 
adopted at its first reading. Without such a document, he said, 
the government would find it very difficult to exercise control 
over the holders of licenses for oil and gas production. 
  The president, government and constituent members of the 
Russian Federation, parliamentary committees and fractions must, 
by 24 June, submit their comments to prepare for the draft law's 
second reading before 1 July.

  [Text] Moscow, 10 Jun -- The State Duma today adopted a 
resolution "On Including the Constitutional Rights of the 
Population to Self-government in the Normative Legal Acts of the 
Subjects of the Russian Federation." It draws the Russian 
Federation president's attention in particular to the need to 
adopt a series of measures to prevent violation of the 
population's constitutional rights to local self-government and 
measures to implement the constitutional rights of the 
population to ownership, use and charge of municipal property. 
It also draws attention to the rights of the bodies of local 
self-government to set up and implement local budgets 
independently. The resolution says the bodies of state power 
among the subjects of the Russian Federation must implement the 
clauses in the Constitution on elections to the bodies of local 
self-government and not allow the practice of postponing 
elections or of appointing the head of local self-government.

  [Text] Groznyy, 12 June (CHECHENPRESS-TASS) -- The Chechen 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs has refuted accusations that 
president Dzhokhar Dudayev was responsible for the collapse of 
the talks with Russia. In a statement issued today by 
CHECHENPRESS, the Foreign Ministry of Chechnya says that 
"Groznyy has never received any proposals or documents from the 
Russian leadership for the forthcoming talks," and therefore the 
Chechen leadership "strongly refutes the accusations that it has 
undermined the allegedly planned talks." The document also 
states that "the Chechen Republic is willing to start talks with 
the Russian Federation only on the principles of equality, with 
no preconditions, and only if Russia abandons the policy of 
state terrorism." 
  The CHECHENPRESS report says that the Chechen Foreign 
Ministry has been provoked to issue the statement because 
"Russian mass media has published reports in which officials 
from the administration of the Russian President and from the 
Ministry for Nationalities and Regional Policy are blaming 
Dzhokhar Dudayev, president of Chechnya, for the collapse of the 
allegedly planned talks between the Chechen Republic and the 
Russian Federation."

  [Text] Vladikavkaz June 10 TASS -- On his return from 
Moscow, Akhsarbek Galazov, president of the Republic of North 
Ossetia, informed today members of the Presidium of the 
government of the republic of his meeting with Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin in Moscow on June 9. 
  According to Akhsarbek Galazov, "the meeting was fruitful. I 
told the Russian president about the situation in the zone under 
the state of emergency regime, and the concrete steps being made 
by the leadership of North Ossetia on the settlement of the 
situation in the zone of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict. The road 
to peace and accord in the region lies only through 
negotiations, and these goals cannot be achieved by forcible 
methods." 
  North Ossetian leaders also discussed issues connected with 
the celebration of the 220th anniversary of Ossetia joining 
Russia and the 210th anniversary of the foundation of the city 
of Vladikavkaz. 
  The president of North Ossetia proposed within the framework 
of these celebrations to organize in Vladikavkaz a meeting of 
all leaders of the Caucasian region with the participation of 
the president of the Russian Federation and the head of the 
Russian government during which it would be possible to consider 
socio-political, economic and inter-ethnic problems, as well as 
the roads to peace and accord in the region. 
  During his talks with President Boris Yeltsin, Akhsarbek 
Galazov stressed, the two sides also touched on the problem of 
signing a full-scale treaty between the Russian Federation and 
the Republic of North Ossetia. This would give the possibility 
to settle social and economic problems of North Ossetia more 
purposively.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Spiridonov, president of Komi </F>
Republic, by ITAR-TASS political observer Gennadiy Bocharov; in 
Syktyvkar 8 June: "I Do Not Intend To Make a Revolution"] 
  [Text] Yuriy Spiridonov granted an interview 8 June, the 
day after the inauguration of the first president in the history 
of the Komi Republic. 
  [Bocharov] You are the first president of the Komi 
Republic.... 
  [Spiridonov] Head of the republic. I believe that there 
must be one president in Russia. There is. 
  [Bocharov] Good. Today is the first day after your official 
inauguration. Which concern of this day -- as of the 100th day, 
which is traditional for summing up the first results -- will be 
the chief and most important concern for you? 
  [Spiridonov] Both today and on the 100th day, and maybe also 
on the 200th, the budget will constitute this concern. 
Although, in connection with the Russian president's recent 
edicts, maybe the situation will yet improve. I very much hope 
so. 
  [Bocharov] How many days out of the first 100 will you spend 
in this office, and how many traveling around the republic? 
  [Spiridonov] The first three days. The rest traveling 
around the republic. In parallel I will be forming the 
government. I do not intend to make a revolution, but serious 
changes are needed. 
  [Bocharov] Personal or structural? 
  [Spiridonov] Mostly structural. The aim is to combat the 
omnipotence of officials. Our chief enemy, as well as the enemy 
of all Russia, is the petty official and the big official. The 
most brilliant projects and undertakings are ruined precisely at 
the level of the official. A Mariya Ivanovna or a Vasiliy 
Petrovich, unknown to anyone, possess a power which is 
frequently out of all relation to that of a minister or even the 
president. 
  [Bocharov] Komi is known to be a veritable storehouse of 
natural riches. In this connection Syktyvkar is constantly 
being visited by representatives of very serious and 
world-renowned firms and corporations. By which criteria do you 
intend to be guided in your approach to cooperation with the 
West in this sense? 
  [Spiridonov] There is one criterion: the good of the cause. 
For the republic and its people. We will rely on the great 
experience of the federal structures. We will also support our 
own structures in every way. 
  The republic's foreign economic activity is growing daily. A 
lot of mistakes are being made and criminal actions being 
committed. But a positive process is already evident. The task 
is clear in this sense too. The republic's enterprises must 
work. Production must grow, not fall. People must earn well. 
We have no reason to fear joint projects or, to put it more 
simply, access for businessmen to our expanses and our riches. 
Here is an interesting thing. Back in 1928, in one of the 
rayons of Komi, the raykom [rayon party committee] bureau 
examined the question of allowing the raykom secretary's son to 
head a British concession. At that time people were not afraid 
of these words, but today we continue to fear these words, such 
as the word "concession." 
  I wish to say that we are ready to deal not only with 
recognized authorities in the West but also with our own 
businessmen with capital. There is no need to blush and hide 
our eyes. Money must work. This is a principled approach. It 
is irrational to waste efforts on a debate over the nature of 
the accumulation of primary capital, unless, of course, it is a 
question of obvious piracy. I repeat once more: Money must 
work, enterprises must build up capacity, and people must earn 
well. Today we cannot allow a negligent or frequently simply 
even a foolish leader of one enterprise or another to go on 
taking a freeloading approach to the budget and to state funds 
and to demand that they be taken from invalids, children, and 
pensioners instead of introducing these funds into the state's 
budget. 
  [Bocharov] The election showed perfectly clearly the level 
of your authority in the republic. In what way do you intend to 
maintain it? 
  [Long silence] 
  [Spiridonov] If it has to be done artifically, then in no 
way....

<F P=106> [Report by own correspondent T. Borisevich: "Yesterday an </F>
Autonomous Body -- Today a State"] 
  [Text] Republic of Komi -- In Syktyvkar Yuriy Spiridonov, 
who won the election of the head of the Republic of Komi, has 
assumed office. The day before a Supreme Council session 
adopted laws on the state emblem, the state flag, and the state 
anthem of the Republic of Komi. The Constitution was adopted 
slightly earlier. 
  It thus has all the attributes of its own statehood. From 
slogans and declarations sovereignty has traveled the path to 
more real symbols. 
  Yesterday autonomy -- today the state. 
  In his greetings telegram Boris Yeltsin called the republic 
one of the most authoritative components of Russian statehood. 
The president put a lot into this admission: The authority of 
Yuriy Spiridonov, the republic's new head, the fact that the 
republic was one of the first to suggest its own version of the 
Federation Treaty, and the fact that it struggled to the end for 
its inclusion in the new Russian Constitution. 
  Unfortunately, not everything is successful. Sovereignty is 
still considerably truncated. Both by the legislators and by 
life. Today in the national republic the people who gave it its 
name are in the minority. Komi's villages are dying because 
they are the provincial and national hinterland. In previous 
"allocation" years the republic was given at least something. 
Now it has been deprived even of those crumbs. Its own 
production does not feed it. It runs at a loss in the North. 
Consumer services are no longer subsidised. That means that 
the village dweller cannot get a haircut, get a television 
repaired, or get a dress sewn. But even that is not a 
misfortune. They trim each other's hair and continue to wear 
old dresses instead of new ones. 
  The trouble lies elsewhere. Children from the hinterland no 
longer get into the institutes and it is not only studying in 
the city but even getting there that is a problem. Even 
professional schools have become unattainable. There is no 
longer the influx of young specialists to the hinterland. And 
without them there will soon be no one to give people medical 
treatment and teach children even in the national school. That 
means the mortality rate will rise and the educational standard 
will decline. And all this will affect primarily the indigenous 
inhabitants. So, for small peoples like the Komi their own 
statehood (even if it is simply declared) is nonetheless a 
blessing. 
  Where apart from its own state will the Komi language 
receive 
the status of a state language? Where else would they have 
managed to develop and introduce at state level with financing 
from the budget programs for development of the Komi language 
and national culture, to open a Komi philology faculty, and 
publish books, journals, and newspapers in the Komi language? 
  For an example I shall just cite part of the budget items 
for 
this year: The publication of national literature, expenditure 
on the production of the "Parma-Yel" newsreels, expenditure on 
the implementation of the law "On the State Languages of the 
Republic of Komi" and "The Conservation and Development of the 
Komi Language." 
  But that is one side of the "state" coin. To build -- a 
house or a state -- you need money. Money is a yardstick of 
true autonomy, independence, and freedom. And a state is only a 
state when it controls money circulation, taxes, and the 
economy. But what can we talk of if, for instance, the republic 
does not even have the funds even to pay people their leave pay. 
For the social sphere alone 71 billion rubles are needed for 
the purpose, with 42 billion being needed for national 
education. That means they have to go cap in hand to the center 
and ask for a loan. That is where its own independence ends. 
  However many serious entrepreneurs visit Komi not one of 
them 
has refrained from asking: Why, when it has stocks of oil, 
coal, gas, titanium ore, and timber, is the republic unable to 
secure a fitting life for its citizens? The answer to this 
question is on the surface. The bulk of revenue goes into the 
Federal Budget. So the national republic's economic autonomy is 
impossible in principle. Moreover, the republic's minister of 
finances and the tax chief get their wages in Moscow. And that 
says a lot. Here the center speaks the same taxation and 
investment language with all components of the Federation while 
the North is quite different from the South and that means the 
language should be different. 
  Today a 700-gramme loaf of bread in Ust-Tsilma (a Komi rayon 
center) costs 1,354 rubles. Because everything, from grain to 
sugar, has to be imported. There are families where bread has 
become a treat and the main food is potatoes, which thankfully 
still grow in the North. In previous years they would at least 
sometimes issue child benefit. This year not a kopek has been 
received for this item from the Federal Budget. This financial 
and legislative dependence of the region on the center weakens 
not only the sovereign republic but also the center. 
  Boris Yeltsin once signed a package of documents on the 
economic and social development of the Republic of Komi. They 
were the precursor to the Federation's civilized economic 
cooperation with one of its components. But they did not 
succeed. The documents are not working. The proposals of the 
components of the federation to move from the fiscal tax system 
to fixed payments into the Russian budget are being ignored. In 
this situation the territories have started to unite on regional 
lines, creating associations like the "Northwest," "Great Volga" 
and others. 
  The election of their own presidents and republic heads in 
yesterday's autonomous bodies is from the same "series." As a 
result, Russia today outstrips Europe in terms of the number of 
presidents. The Republic of Komi is one of the most recent to 
take this step. This will undoubtedly strengthen its statehood. 
But Russian statehood?

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel Network in Russian at 1020 GMT on 11 June broadcasts a 
40-minute recording of a meeting between Ukrainian President 
Leonid Kravchuk and Russian media correspondents. 
  Kravchuk opens the meeting with a brief speech, thanking the 
correspondents for attending. Kravchuk then answers a 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA question about a possible joint ownership of 
Crimea by Russia and Ukraine. Kravchuk replies: 
  "This idea should be put forward by the party that wants it. 
If, for instance, the Crimea wants it, then it is not for us to 
tell the Crimea, look, we are going to own you on a joint basis. 
But there have been no such statements or intentions on the 
part of past or present Crimean leaders. The Crimean leaders 
have only expressed one opinion to date: First, they want to be 
granted a statehood as a transitional stage and then, to become 
part of Russia. This is a program, a goal of the party that is 
currently in the majority in the parliament. The Crimean 
president has the same program. All this time, especially 
lately, they have been distancing themselves from Ukraine in all 
possible ways except in the economic sphere, because they are 
fully aware Crimea is 93 percent dependent on Ukraine." 
  He says the idea of a joint Russian-Ukrainian ownership of 
Crimea would be difficult to put into practice: 
  "If the question of equal cultural, political, religious, 
ethnic, and other conditions for Russians and Ukrainians in the 
Crimea is raised, you will see at once that this problem cannot 
be resolved. This joint ownership will mean that 95 percent will 
be de facto owned by Russia and 5 percent, de jure, by Ukraine." 
  Asked what way out he could propose, he said: "There is only 
one way out -- that the Crimean authorities should act in 
conformity with the Constitution, that's all." 
  At 1034 GMT a LITERATURNAYA GAZETA correspondent asks 
Kravchuk if it could be guaranteed that he will refrain from the 
use of force in settling the Crimean issue. Kravchuk answers: 
  "I can tell you with full certainty that under no 
circumstances will the leadership of Ukraine and I as its 
president use forcible methods in resolving the Crimean issue. 
I have said this at a Supreme Council session for all our 
people to hear, because we realize that however much this might 
hurt everyone, it would mean first and foremost a tragedy to us, 
and it is our people who would suffer most. I have accordingly 
called on the Crimean leadership to follow the same principle." 
He says the Moldova-Dniester region situation should not be 
allowed to evolve between Ukraine and Crimea and warned against 
any provocations, be it by Russian or Ukrainian forces, with 
regard to the Crimea. 
  Halfway through the program a KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA 
correspondent asks whether Russia and Ukraine would be able to 
reach an agreement on the Black Sea Fleet. Kravchuk says: 
  "Today the only issue is where the fleet will be stationed. 
The infrastructure, all land-based economy of the Navy and so 
on come later. What is the Russian stance today? That Ukraine 
must have one base in the Crimea, in Donuzlav. Everything else 
in the Crimea should belong to the Russian Black Sea Fleet -- 
not only Sevastopol. Sevastopol alone is 150 km. So, my 
question is: Is it that Sevastopol is the base of the Russian 
Navy or is it that the Russian Navy's base is in Sevastopol? 
This is not just an editorial change. If it is Sevastopol, 
this means 150 km. If the Russian Navy also takes hold of 
Feodosia, Kerch, they even have Yalta on the list -- one does 
not know why, it is not a military facility...(pauses) I will 
then ask a practical question I keep raising with the 
authorities, including Russian authorities. It so happens that 
85 percent of all the infrastructure of the Black Sea Fleet of 
the former Soviet Union -- I quote the figure from memory, so I 
may be wrong -- is concentrated in Sevastopol. All or most 
officers and junior ranks of the fleet live in Sevastopol. So, 
today Ukraine receives its 174 ships, let us say, and they tell 
us: move 160 km away from Sevastopol. We need -- just for these 
ships -- 2,500 officers and junior ranks. They live in 
Sevastopol, however. Are they prepared to move?" 
  He goes on to say that he understands Russia's interests in 
the Black Sea: 
  "Russia is interested in having its Navy in the Black Sea. 
It does not have any other options right now. It is the south 
frontier, interests must be protected and so on. I understand 
it, we are not children here. Russia uses other bases on the 
basis of a contract with Ukraine, through agreements. That's 
it. But one should accept that these are Ukraine's bases." 
  He concludes by saying that the agreement should be reached 
following international principals: 
  "There should be a lease agreement for Russia's main base in 
Sevastopol. This is a norm -- that is what other countries do, 
so we have not invented anything here. All other bases, which 
are there -- the Russian Navy needs them -- all these bases 
should be used by Russia through separate agreements." 
  As he closes his meeting with the Russian correspondents, 
Kravchuk asks the journalists to help build relations between 
Russia and Ukraine with long-term prospects in mind. 
  "We are living for today. Sometimes our relations are 
determined by mercenary considerations, by feelings such as we 
shall show them, we shall cut them off, we are not going to pay, 
they are bad because they want to be independent. This is not 
like us. For 340 years, we have not fought against one another. 
And today, when the question is asked if there will be war 
between Russia and Ukraine, I answer without hesitation: no, 
there won't be. This is like the Lord's Prayer to me. No, I 
say, this is simply inadmissible. If we fail to realize now 
that we have reached the point where our future, our children 
and grandchildren might be at risk -- that will be the most 
frightening thing imaginable."

  [Text] The press service of Ukraine's president and 
government has reported that another round of talks between the 
government delegations of Ukraine and Russia concluded in Kiev, 
having made considerable progress in drawing up an agreement on 
the first stage of settling the Black Sea Fleet issue. Yuriy 
Dubinin, the Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry 
ambassador-at-large and head of the Russian delegation, is of 
the opinion that the meeting held was characterized by greater 
mutual understanding and even the desire sometimes to reach a 
compromise in order to resolve the extremely complex problem of 
the Black Sea Fleet. 
  The sides agreed on a list of the amphibious means that are 
subject to division, as well as the off-shore and shore 
infrastructure items that associated with them as well as social 
sphere facilities. 
  Valeriy Shmarov, deputy prime minister and head of the 
Ukrainian delegation, underlined that a decision on the Black 
Sea Fleet could only be taken in a package of accords which 
would be approved by both heads of state.

  [Excerpts] Our correspondent Mykola Marynenko has asked 
Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov, head of the delegation 
[of Ukraine at the Russian-Ukrainian Black Sea Fleet talks], to 
comment on the Ukrainian side's position. 
  [Begin recording] [Marynenko] Esteemed Valeriy Mykolayovych, 
talking about the Black Sea Fleet, you will probably agree with 
me that this problem conventionally, as it were, falls into two 
categories: Strictly speaking, these are the ships and the 
infrastructure. This, at any rate, is how the mass media have 
lately been reporting on all those problems associated, I would 
like to underline, with the Black Sea Fleet. But, once again, I 
have analyzed reports by the mass media, you know, and have 
(somehow) come to the conclusion that the issue of the ships 
also conventionally falls into two categories: While earlier we 
spoke of the ships as having already been divided, we now say 
that ships have already been counted, with so many to belong to 
Russia and so many to belong to Ukraine after the division of 
the Black Sea Fleet. I would like you to clarify the situation 
with regard to the above problem, please. 
  [Shmarov] I think there are somewhat more problems than 
those 
enumerated by you. [passage indistinct] 
  I would like to return for a while to the origins of this 
issue and recall that the negotiations have been held since 15 
April when the Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin signed an agreement on this issue, where 
it was noted that the navies should be separated within (quite) 
a short time. [passage omitted] 
  As for the problems, problem number one is, (undoubtedly), 
the amphibious means, or ships. 
  Problem number two is, certainly, the infrastructure that 
you 
mentioned, i.e. the (fleet's) shore infrastructure and 
everything that is land-based, in this particular case, on the 
territory of Crimea, with all the Black Sea Fleet's property 
being considered such as the land-based airfields, 
communications and combined-arms units, marines, and machinery 
that belongs to these arms of service. This is a very large 
number of complex facilities. 
  The third problem, I would say, is -- now, in addition to 
what you named -- the problem of the (status of) bases, i.e. the 
problem of bases and (the status) of bases. [passage indistinct] 
  The fourth problem, I would say, is the problem of the 
people 
who are now serving on board ships and in (inland) facilities. 
They are today provisionally subordinate to the two presidents, 
i.e. (subordinate) to two states and (are within) two states. 
Today, however, their living conditions are more or less 
(stationary), stable, while what we are proposing they do 
tomorrow is something else, which again is quite a problem. 
[passage indistinct] 
  As for broad coverage of this and large-scale 
(advertisements) of our achievements, we agreed with the Russian 
delegation not to make any general statements and not to provide 
information for the general public, because what we have done by 
now concerns people and today, when we have not finished yet and 
have no final decision signed by the presidents, [to provide 
that information] would be (like jumping the gun). So until 
then, no doubt, we have no right to cause anxiety among the 
people. [passage indistinct] 
  I can say, however, that, indeed, we have already carried 
out 
the final division of the fleet. I mean the final division, 
rather than making a list. We proceeded from the fact that we 
must form two fleets, rather than just splitting up materiel 
according to the principle of accountancy, as it were, with the 
remainder of the value being calculated etc. (Instead), we for 
quite a long time have been working to create two fleets, two 
forces, and I would not say it was simple. We believe that 
those forces must jointly ensure both the security of Ukraine 
(in the south) and, undoubtedly, the security of Russia and its 
(strategic) interest in that theater or that basin, no doubt 
communicating with each other, undoubtedly so. I think that 
their future is a joint strategic mission. [passage indistinct] 
  The main position of ours on this issue is this: First, our 
unalterable principle is that everything that is on the 
territory and soil of Ukraine and the territory of (Crimea) is 
the property of Ukraine. We acted in accordance with that 
principle from the outset of the negotiations [words indistinct] 
and we cannot offer anything other than that, because this is 
what is required by our laws and this is how our state wants it 
today. That is our property. [passage omitted] 
  [Marynenko] Does the Russian side realize how much renting 
this infrastructure, that you once again said belongs to Ukraine 
and the people of Ukraine, will cost? 
  [Shmarov] I do not think it does in terms of specific 
figures, because it was not practiced in the former union. 
[passage omitted] 
  Now, as for the bases. It is a common secret that the bases 
of the Russian Navy and those of the Ukrainian Navy are the 
stumbling block at these negotiations. 
  At the first stage, Russia unconditionally pushed for 
Ukraine 
to base its Navy in Odessa or Nikolayev and that was that. They 
did not even want to talk about Crimea. Understanding the 
importance of these negotiations and searching for ways of 
resolving this problem by peaceful means, as it were, i.e. by 
way of negotiations, the Ukrainian side, on the other hand, 
after all, consented that, all right, let Sevastopol be the 
Russian Navy base. At the same time, however, Ukraine proposed 
that other bases in that very Crimea belong to Ukraine. 
  [Marynenko] Tell me please, at this meeting with the Russian 
side, was understanding reached, as it were, or is the problem 
still quite complex? 
  [Shmarov] [Words indistinct] I have already said that we are 
definitely making headway. [passage indistinct] [end recording]

  [Text] A meeting of the committee organizing an 
international conference of political parties from the countries 
of the so-called Black Sea-Baltic area was held in Kiev. It has 
already been reported that this conference is being called on 
the initiative of the Ukrainian Republican Party, the Democratic 
Party [of Ukraine], and the Green Party [of Ukraine] with the 
aim of setting up a league of political organizations of the 
countries between the [Black and Baltic] seas. In particular, 
it was stated at the meeting that the Belarusian Popular Front 
and a number of parties from Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, 
Moldova, Romania, and Hungary have already expressed a desire to

  [Text] For a state like Ukraine, participation in the 
sitting of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council promotes its 
gradual integration into the processes and structures now 
emerging in Europe. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Zlenko declared 
this in an interview for Ukrainian journalists after the Council 
had ended its sitting in Istanbul. Zlenko believes that such 
gatherings facilitate an immediate and open dialogue with 
partners, offering the chance to explain a position more 
clearly, while at the same time allowing the state to win 
supporters on an array of urgent issues. 
  Zlenko emphasized that this year's conference of heads of 
foreign political departments from 38 countries was, to a 
certain extent, a success with regard to greater understanding 
of existing problems and defining approaches to solutions. 
Zlenko expressed satisfaction with the fact that the statement 
adopted at the sitting of the North Atlantic Cooperation 
Council, which assesses the situation around Crimea, notes that 
the Crimean issue should be solved in compliance with the UN 
Charter and the Final Act of the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe and with respect to Ukraine's territorial 
integrity.

<F P=106> [Report by Stanislav Tyshchenko: "Border Oblasts"] </F>
  [Text] Although the border between Ukraine and the Russian 
Federation exists de jure and de facto, it somehow defies 
comprehension. It is too bizarre a fact, especially for elderly 
people. This is why it will not be taken seriously yet for a 
long time. But still, this is a fact. The division of the two 
sovereign states has been made and cannot be undone. It dealt a 
hard blow primarily to the economy of the former Soviet Union. 
Enterprises tightly linked with each other started to lose 
their ground. The absence of a single center with its almighty 
State Planning Committee, the disruption of links to the quick, 
and chaos in settlements of accounts led to the present 
condition. What next? 
  In eastern Ukraine, southern Russia, and the border-adjacent 
regions, attempts are being undertaken to somehow resuscitate 
economic relations based on the current situation in both 
countries. The press has already reported that border area 
leaders met in Belgorod and Kharkov to lay the groundwork for 
closer financial and economic cooperation. A similar meeting 
took place last week in Donetsk. It was held behind closed 
doors, and at a press conference held on 27 May, its 
participants were not too talkative, asking the journalists for 
questions without making any introduction. This is only natural 
-- everything is still in a "suspended condition" of 
preparations, initial work, etc. Besides, an unclear political 
situation at either side of the border offers no strong grounds 
to hope for success of the planned undertaking. 
  However, there is a movement forward. A council of border 
area leaders was organized, and an agreement is in the works 
between Ukrainian and Russian Governments on cooperation among 
border areas. The status of those oblasts and specific routing 
of capital circulation is being determined. 
  The gist of the responses from the press conference 
participants is that the main purpose of this unconventional 
bilateral body is to reduce, if not eliminate, border and 
customs barriers and to make cooperation on the border more 
profitable, efficient, and to improve the living standards of 
Russian and Ukrainian people. 
  Of course, the intentions are good. But will they become a 
reality? This will depend on decisions made on the government 
level. Incidentally, the meeting was attended by 
representatives of Russian and Ukrainian presidents and 
governments. The following oblasts were represented: Donetsk, 
Lugansk, Sumy, and Kharkov (the delegation from Chernigov Oblast 
did not arrive). The Russian side was represented by Belgorod, 
Bryansk, Voronezh, Rostov, and Kursk Oblasts. 
  At the press conference, it was particularly stressed that 
the entire work of the border oblast leaders' council is 
intended to solve purely economic and humanitarian issues, but 
not political ones. For example, the association for economic 
cooperation "Russian-Ukrainian Union" is being established. 
Work is being conducted on the implementation of Leonid 
Kravchuk's edict on free education for Ukrainian and Russian 
students at colleges and universities located in the border 
areas. 
  In other words, the process has gotten off to a good start. 
The most important thing is that it is peaceful, based on 
mutual understanding, and that it pursues good intentions. 
  The next meeting, or to be more precise, the meeting of the 
council, is scheduled for September in Rostov-on-Don.

  [Text] On the eve of his official visit to the United 
States of America, which begins on 13 June, Ukrainian Army 
General Vitaliy Radetskyy, Ukraine's minister of defense, met 
representatives of the U.S. mass media accredited in Kiev. 
  Vitaliy Radetskyy related that he would be meeting the U.S. 
vice president, the secretary of defense, well-known senators, 
and the Ukrainian diaspora. Ukraine's minister of defense will 
also visit a number of military bases and observe the process of 
destroying a strategic ballistic missile and its launching silo. 
Among the issues it is planned to discuss during the week-long 
visit the problems of the development of Ukraine's armed forces, 
the continuation of nuclear disarmament in accordance with the 
trilateral statement by the presidents of the United States, 
Ukraine and Russia, national security, Ukraine's participation 
in the Partnership for Peace program, the problem of Crimea and 
the division of the Black Sea Fleet occupy an important place. 
  When the U.S. journalists asked where, in the opinion of the 
Ukrainian military minister, Ukraine's Navy should be based, 
Vitaliy Radetskyy replied: 
  [Begin Radetskyy recording] There is no talk about this 
because [words indistinct] the Crimea is a constituent part of 
Ukraine. This issue is not even being raised, and it should not 
be raised either. Only one issue is being raised -- the site 
for the temporary basing for the Russian Navy. [end recording]

  [Text] External political departments of Argentina, 
Denmark, Israel, China, and Japan have recently made official 
statements in support of Ukraine with regard to resolving the 
conflict situation in the Crimea. This became known at a 
briefing at Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In addition 
to official circles of the world's leading countries, 
international organizations, public associations, and the 
Ukrainian diaspora have also demonstrated their solidarity with 
our state. All of them are in favor of a peaceful settlement of 
the conflict situation in which the principles set by the CSCE 
-- inviolability of borders and maintenance of states' 
territorial integrity -- will be adhered to. It was also stated 
at the briefing that a Ukrainian delegation headed by minister 
of foreign affairs A. Zlenko will soon visit Istanbul where it 
will take part in the session of the Council of the North 
Atlantic Cooperation. The program "Partnership for Peace" will 
be the main topic of the discussion.

Moscow in the run-up to independence day, by the Institute of 
Sociology and Parliamentarism. 
  At the same time, the number of people in the capital who 
agree with, or express some positive interest in, the 
president's policies is down from 55 percent in May 1991 to 28 
percent in May this year. The number of Muscovites who do not 
agree with the president's policies has increased from 13 to 23 
percent over this period.

Choice movement and faction. But Yegor Gaydar, leader of the 
faction, pointed out that the word "democratic" was added to the 
name for the sake of definition and to indicate what kind of 
choice we are offering Russia. 
  The delegates of the congress have also adopted, as a basis, 
the program and the rules of the new party.

  [Text] Moscow June 12 TASS -- "It is vitally important 
today to have a united political force, capable of rallying and 
putting into effect the democratic and reforming potential of 
society. This is what the Russia's Democratic Choice Party is 
being created for," says the preamble to the programme of the 
new party, which was adopted as a basis today by its founding 
congress. The programme is an extensive document, which sets 
forth the stand of the new political organisation with regard to 
problems of the economic and social policy, the state setup, the 
anti-crime struggle, culture, arts, science, education and 
ecology. 
  The economic section of the programme describes as vitally 
important the reduction of the share of state expenditures in 
the budget and the gross national product. The new party 
favours the adoption of a long-term programme of the military 
reform, which will provide for the reduction of the army along 
with the reduction of its budget to the level of 3-3.5 per cent. 
  The new party finds it necessary to reform the tax system, 
to 
bring down the overall level of the income tax and lay emphasis 
on the taxation of land and immovables. 
  In the opinion of Russia's Democratic Choice, privatization 
is the main condition for achieving economic growth. The money 
received as a result of the selling of shares should be 
channelled not to the state treasury, but to enterprises 
themselves for their rebuilding, and investors should be given a 
possibility to buy the controlling block of shares. 
  The new party believes that the agrarian policy should 
ensure 
by all means the support for private and cooperative enterprises 
in the sphere of the marketing and processing of farm produce, 
for a further liberalisation of agricultural markets, the 
creation of the agricultural crediting system and the formation 
of mechanisms of regulating the land market. 
  In the opinion of Russia's Democratic Choice, the social 
policy should be based on principles of stopping excessive state 
protectionism, on the state's responsibility for the 
unconditional granting of minimal social guarantees in the 
sphere of labour remuneration, pensions, public health, 
education and culture. 
  As for the national security and foreign policy, the party 
believes that partner relations with industrially developed 
countries do not at all mean that Russia's interests will be 
"dissolved" in the interests of the West. "Even the closest 
allied relations provide for the active upholding of one's own 
interests. Under no condition will Russia agree to the role of a 
junior partner," the document says. 
  The party believes that the restoration of a common economic 
space on the territory of the former USSR is one of the key 
tasks of Russia's policy with regard to the former USSR 
republics. It is pointed out, however, that this should not be 
done hastily and with too much fuss.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Alexandrova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 12 -- "We are creating a party to defend 
future Russia and its dignity, turn it into a country of free 
and well-off people, "said leader of the "Russia's Choice" Yegor 
Gaydar, as he outlined the tasks of the party, addressing its 
founding congress today. The congress, which will continue for 
two days, is being held in the Russian parliamentary center. 
  Gaydar pointed out that one of the main tasks of the new 
party is to bring the truth home to the people and oppose 
demagogy and lies advocated by political adversaries. "We need 
a strong political organization, and therefore, we are creating 
a party," Gaydar said. 
  The pointed out that the fundamental task of the party is to 
create prerequisites for stable economic development. In his 
opinion, the economic course which has been pursued in Russia 
over the past 1.5 years is a course of compromise and 
fluctuations, which is, in fact, a departure from the solution 
of existing problems. "It is dangerous to repudiate a challenge, 
since this creates an instable environment which is a nourishing 
media for extremists' experiments, Gaydar said. If this 
tendency continues for another 3-5 years, the country will find 
itself under a colonial rule, Gaydar said. 
  Among cardinal tasks needed for Russia's normal development 
Gaydar mentioned defense policies and problems of security. He 
pointed out the importance "of conducting a consistent and 
steadfast military reform, which fully meets servicemen's 
interests". In his opinion, the existing army is "a too heavy 
burden for Russia and it needs reorganization." Gaydar said 
that it is necessary to reduce the number of the army personnel, 
saying that this does not mean any disrespect towards the army. 
  Another "colossal problem" faced by Russia is an enormous 
and 
inefficient state mechanism and an unnecessary large "army of 
officials," Gaydar said. In his opinion, one of the most 
important problems is the agrarian reform which has been 
practically frozen today. Gaydar pointed out that the agrarian 
reform should enter a new stage and that attempts to maintain 
the collapsing system of collective and state farms should be 
rejected. 
  Touching upon foreign policy problems, Gaydar said that 
relations with "near abroad" are the most important task. He 
pointed out that "it is necessary to work steadfastly for the 
creation of a single market on the territory of the former 
Soviet Union and the creation of the customs and currency 
unions. However, advocating the comprehensive development of 
integration on the territory of the former Soviet Union and the 
defense of the Russian-speaking population, Gaydar categorically 
came out against political scheming and the solution of other 
problems at the expense of Russian taxpayers.

  [Text] Any Russian citizen aged 18 and more can join the 
newly formed Russia's Democratic Choice party, if he or she 
shares its fundamental principles, observes its rules and does 
not belong to other political parties. 
  These are the rules of the new party approved by the 
founding 
congress that ended in Moscow on Monday. It also approved as a

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Yegor Gaydar, chairman of </F>
Russia's Democratic Choice, by Nikolay Ivanov; place and date 
not given; from the "Novosti" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Ivanov] You have said that the new party is not a 
party belonging to a certain class, is that not so? In your 
view, whose party is it, in that case? 
  [Gaydar] It is the party for those people who want a calm 
and dignified future for Russia. It is the party for those who 
do not wish their children to fight for a way out to the Indian 
Ocean. It is the party for those who are well aware that there 
is no going back, and that any experiments in that direction are 
dangerous, that we have one proper path -- namely, to be a 
civilized, democratic, market society. 
  The problem with us is that we often do not know how to 
explain and defend these ideas and, as a result, yield the field 
of political struggle to people who have a single, very simple 
little idea, and a very dangerous little idea, namely: let's 
find a non-Russian enemy and try to turn Russian society against 
that enemy. So, in order to prevent such people from gaining the 
political arena we need a serious and effective democratic 
organization.

<F P=106> [Yevgeniy Yanayev report: "Criticism Could Be Heard Even at </F>
the Founding Congress"] 
  [Text] The founding congress of the party being organized 
by Yegor Gaydar, scheduled for 12 June, is attracting 
considerable attention. First, because this organization is 
associated with the president. Second, the congress can be seen 
as an attempt to create in a country with a multitude of 
minority parties the first real party of liberal-conservative 
orientation. Furthermore, the party organizers are making no 
secret that their main task is to ensure a second presidential 
term for Boris Yeltsin or a first term for Yegor Gaydar. 
  Yegor Gaydar is creating his party not under the best 
possible conditions, primarily because Gaydar's new party is 
based on the Russia's Choice election bloc whose showing in the 
December elections, according to official results, proved to be 
far from what was desired. Naturally, one also cannot ignore 
the general political apathy of the population, whose majority 
since the CPSU days has developed a steady allergy to any 
parties. 
  Furthermore, having invited Democratic Russia supporters to 
the new party ranks, Yegor Gaydar incurred criticism from 
right-wing elements for splitting the democratic movements. It 
is not ruled out that they will voice their complaints at the 
founding congress. Besides, even among those who agree to join 
the new organization there are differences in views on the 
principles of party organizational development. The former head 
of government is being urged to create a party not "to fit 
himself," also not to insist on rigid discipline, and to 
enshrine collective leadership. Yet chances are that there will 
be more Gaydar supporters at the congress -- such authoritative 
figures as Sergey Filatov, Andrey Kozyrev, and Anatoliy Chubays 
are expected to attend -- and therefore the new party will be 
established, and Gaydar himself will be elected its leader. 
Incidentally, according to information received from the 
Russia's Choice leadership, Yegor Gaydar has so far not been 
able to obtain assurances that Boris Yeltsin will be present at 
the founding congress. 
  In spite of all the problems, the new organization's 
potential capabilities look fairly serious. Rigid discipline, 
Gaydar's regular meetings with Yeltsin -- giving the party some 
additional weight -- free access for its functionaries to the 
corridors of power, and considerable financial resources -- all 
this gives reason to suppose that Russia's Choice (unless, that 
is, its name is changed) will become one of the major political 
parties in the country. 
<H5>  From the Russia's Choice Draft Program: </H5>
  --It is necessary to defeat inflation. The state budget 
deficit must be covered by floating state securities. 
  --A most important task is to reduce the tax burden, 
stimulating business activity. 
  --Encouragement of domestic and foreign investments should 
be 
accompanied by the provision of preferential conditions for 
small and medium-sized businesses. --A major prerequisite for 
economic growth is privatization. We are for protection of 
private property obtained legitimately from legal sources, and 
we are against private property living off state property like a 
parasite. 
  --The party's agrarian policy envisions completion of reform 
in the countryside and formation of an effective property 
structure.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS commentator Tamara Zamyatina on </F>
interview with Sergey Filatov, head of the Russian President's 
Staff, specially for ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI; date and place not 
given: "Sergey Filatov: Russia Needs a Policy of Accord"] 
  [Text] The fourth anniversary of the adoption of the 
Declaration of Russian State Sovereignty 12 June 1990 confirms 
that, by gaining independence, the Russian Federation [RF] has 
survived as an integral state and is still growing stronger. 
That was the opinion voiced during an interview with your 
ITAR-TASS commentator by Sergey Filatov, head of the Russian 
President's Staff. Moreover, according to him, the problem does 
not boil down to ensuring the inviolability of state borders and 
defending the country against external threat. It is a question 
of creating a contemporary federal state in which both the 
regions and citizens of various nationalities enjoy extensive 
democratic rights. 
  Sergey Filatov recalled that Boris Yeltsin issued an edict 4 
June giving 12 June the status of a RF state holiday. Since 
this day currently falls on a Sunday, 13 June has been declared 
a nonworking day in accordance with Russian laws. 
  In Sergey Filatov's opinion, the adoption of the new RF 
Constitution, the Federation Treaty, and the bilateral Treaty 
Between Russia and Tatarstan -- a document that was the prologue 
to the establishment of new relations between the center and 
Federation components -- were important milestones in the 
strengthening of the Russian Federation. 
  "The Russian president's recent trip to Tatarstan 
demonstrated that the bilateral treaty has helped secure total 
political stabilization in a republic where separatist 
sentiments were strong quite recently," my interlocutor noted. 
  On this basis it has become possible to formulate a program 
to strengthen the republic's economy by joint efforts on the 
part of the federal and republic authorities. Following the 
example of the bilateral treaty with Tatarstan, similar 
agreements will be signed in the near future with 
Kabardino-Balkaria, Bashkiria, and Kaliningrad Oblast. 
  As far as strengthening the state is concerned, the head of 
the President's Staff attaches great importance to the Treaty on 
Social Accord, which has been signed in the past month by 854 
statesmen, politicians, and public figures. Boris Yeltsin's 
edict on the transformation of the Public Chamber under the 
Russian president into a coordinating conciliation organ is 
expected shortly in order to put this treaty into effect. 
  Tremendous work lies ahead in the sphere of regional policy, 
which has not so far been backed up with legislative acts -- 
constitutions for republics within the RF, kray and oblast 
charters, and a law on local self-government, which it is 
intended to adopt in June. According to Sergey Filatov, the RF 
president's State-Legal Administration and Administration for 
Work with the Territories, along with the Ministry for 
Nationalities' Affairs and Regional Policy, will direct their 
efforts to providing Federation components with their own 
legislation in the near future. 
  Sergey Filatov said that the aim of state regional policy is 
to secure a "rich and uniform life for all Russia's citizens." 
However, attaining this objective is inconceivable without 
accord between the peoples inhabiting the RF. "Provided that 
there is accord we will secure economic and political 
stabilization as early as this year. If there is no accord you 
can postpone the dream of a normal life until the next century," 
Sergey Filatov concluded.

Khadzhi Akhmadiyev. 
  At the congress of the Islamic Party in Moscow, where less 
than a dozen of representatives of the Moscow and Saratov party 
organizations took part, it was decided to change the name of 
the organization for a [as received] Moslem Civilized Party. 
Its leader Akhmadiyev received the right to appoint personnally 
people for senior posts of the party. 
  Akhmadiyev has told Interfax, the party has about five 
thousand members, mainly in places where Tatars live, and 
considers its potential partners all organization of the 
democratic spectrum. He said that even if financial aid is 
offered from abroad, for example from Iran, Iraq or Saudi 
Arabia, we shall not reject it to be able to take independent 
decisions without any pressure from the outside, said Akhmadiyev.

  [Text] Moscow June 12 TASS -- Despite bad weather, a 
demonstration, announced by the irreconcilable opposition, did 
take place in Moscow. According to the estimates of the 
militia, some 2,500 people took part in it. Parties and 
movements included in the National Salvation Front marked today 
the fourth anniversary of the adoption of the declaration on 
Russia's state sovereignty with a march and a meeting. The 
initiative of holding the demonstration came from the Labour 
Russia Movement, the Russian Communist Workers' Party, led by 
Viktor Anpilov, the Revival Party and other organisations. 
  A column with streamers saying "USSR is our homeland", "All 
power to the soviets of working people" etc. marched under the 
torrential rain from the Triumphalnaya Square to the centre of 
the city by the Tverskaya Street. 
  The meeting was held in the very centre of Moscow, at the 
Teatralnaya Square. Opening the meeting, Sazhiy Umalatova, head 
of the permanent presidium of the Congress of People's Deputies, 
described June 12 as "the day of national mourning" and urged 
people to demand early presidential elections. Chairman of the 
Russian Party of Communists Anatoliy Kryuchkov, who took the 
floor after Mrs. Umalatova, has a different view of the tactics 
of the struggle. In his opinion, a massive civil disobedience 
campaign is the only form of the struggle that could be used in 
the current situation in Russia. Skurlatov, leader of the 
Revival Party, went even further. He described the existing 
system as an "occupation regime whose orders and instructions 
are all illegal" and urged to create "a Russian area of 
guerrilla warfare" and "parallel power structures." 
  Viktor Aniplov, the leader of the Labour Russia Movement, 
suggested that "working people should be persuaded to declare a 
general political strike." 
  The meeting was addressed as well by Vladislav Achalov and 
Oleg Shenin, leader of the Union of Communist Parties -- CPSU.

  [Text] Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin returned 
to Moscow today. As you know, he was in Germany where he 
underwent a medical examination. Here is what the prime 
minister answered to questions from journalists at the airport 
today. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Viktor 
Stepanovich, how are you? 
  [Chernomyrdin] Why, I'm feeling O.K., can't you see from the 
way I look? 
  [Correspondent] What about your immediate plans, Viktor 
Stepanovich? What are you going to do today and tomorrow? 
  [Chernomyrdin] [laughs] Well, I intend to complete some 
things I started in Sochi. Next week there will be many serious 
things to do -- meetings, another working visit. Now that I'm 
home I'll start working. 
  [Correspondent] You probably heard during your vacation 
about 
publications in the press concerning your possible resignation 
and so on. Do you not think that a very curious thing can be 
observed: As soon as the president goes on vacation, an 
incomprehensible version emerges [as heard]; as soon as you go 
on vacation rumors about a resignation and changes in the 
Cabinet appear. Whose interests do you think are served by this? 
  [Chernomyrdin] There are some who want to rock us all the 
time and keep the whole society, the whole country in a state of 
tension. These forces do exist. It is such a torment for the 
president, who cannot leave, cannot go anywhere, because 
fabrications and lies spring up immediately. Now they have 
reached me, too. 
  I am not really intent on staying in one place, but to stoop 
to such a mean trick -- I just cannot find any other word -- 
this is too much. 
  [Correspondent] Today, the president sided with Moscow Mayor 
Yuriy Luzhkov in the dispute [with Anatoliy Chubays] over the 
privatization program. Do you know anything about this? 
  [Chernomyrdin] One cannot turn a dispute between two leaders 
into a conflict, as it were, on a nationwide scale. What 
matters is something completely different. What exactly? We 
only have one Moscow, and no doubt Moscow requires a special 
approach. What are the differences, very briefly? First, Yuriy 
Mikhaylovich [Luzhkov] insists on conducting cash-based 
privatization in Moscow. Quite rightly. The country in general 
is moving toward it, toward cash-based privatization, from 1 
July. But to change the rules of the game now, while the game 
is in progress, to change them for the whole country -- I 
believe that is not quite the right thing. As for Moscow, we 
will probably provide special terms, so that it can move to that 
stage earlier. The country in general will move to it from 1 
July. There are also other peculiarities, which are acceptable 
for Moscow, but not, at this juncture, for the country in 
general. So here I cannot agree with Yuriy Mikhaylovich in 
every respect. [Anatoliy] Chubays is my deputy, the program has 
been drawn up and approved by the government, and we will be 
carrying out this program. [end recording]

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel Network in Russian in the 1100 GMT "Novosti" newscast on 
10 June carries a 2-minute video report by correspondent Irina 
Mishina on an exhibition of new GAZ cars in central Moscow which 
was attended by Russian Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets. 
After describing the cars, Mishina reports: 
  "Automobiles were not the only subject brought up. There was 
also mention of the reports in which journalists have firmly 
predicted that Oleg Soskovets will be the next prime minister." 
  A recording of remarks by Oleg Soskovets then follows. He 
says: 
  "This is obviously a provocation by your esteemed 
journalistic colleagues. They understand their role in the 
economic reforms as being constantly to provoke some political 
situation or other. I have no other thoughts on this subject."
